5,Season 3 raises the bar,"I enjoyed this show's initial two seasons, but often thought the writing was a bit weak.Season three raises the bar with much better dialog, story realism, and intensity.This has become a very fun show!"
5,You're missing out!,"This show (and indeed, the entire season) is smoking hot. Assassinations, intrigues and a cast who you cannot take your eyes off of: if you are not watching this show, you are truly missing out. If you watch nothing else this season you should, at least watch the season finale, USA network, Tuesday, November 20. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great episode and season finale,Great episode and season finale... I missed it on the broadcast night and there were no repeats. Used my Amazon Prime Membership to view the episode. I was disappointed that I could not watch it on my HD TV through my iPad. HMDI appears to be not supported on these episodes. Bummer.
2,"Covert Affairs S3 - YES!, Mini EP - eh","I was on the fence as to whether or not that I should order a season pass. Guess what! I should not have. Had I known that a 20 minute episode (Sight Unseen) was going to be thrown in at a full charge, I would have picked only the full-length episodes to purchase and download. I feel a bit taken since this so-called prequel IS free online, but not here on amazon. I feel a bit taken."
3,Not loving this episode or this season so far!,"Ok, where are the writers going with this series? First Annie was the spy of the new age and now she just sucks! She fell in love with a charge and at every turn this season, she can't get anything right. I say again, where are the writers going with this series? If they don't hurry up and make her a super spy again, I'm going to have to let this series go! I hope the next episode is much better because man in the middle was stupid and predictable!"
4,Covert Affairs 2012,"Overall an excellent season. Plenty of action as usual. Eventually Annie & Augie will be together (but the writers have to make them suffer first, of course).. Both of them had to suffer heartbreak & rage this year. I was sorry to see Jay written out, but I'm glad Arthur & Joan's realtionship isn't being ignored. Sarah Clarke had an excellent arc as this season's main villain, but she seems to be typecast now as the b**ch who kills the main charcater's love interest."
5,Super Spy,"I love the character development this season and the fact that it is not a bunch of independent episodes. I love the romance between Simon and Annie and how it helps make her seem a bit more human. The previous seasons had too much perfection in them. This is a good show that I really enjoy watching, especially because it does not go exactly where viewers would first anticipate it too. There are twists and turns that keep it alive."
5,Covert Affairs,This show is my favorite. Just found it this season and absolutely think it is the best show on cable !!! Auggie and Annie are fabulous together....!!!
5,very entertaining TV series.,haven't seen third season yet. but season 1 was really awesome action drama comedy I'll come together I need a pretty good show if you're in the secret agent films.
4,Annie hits reality.,"This episode has Annie getting a hard reality check, which was badly needed to keep the show from going too far off the path of reality and ""willing suspension of disbelief.""The Augie/Annie dance keeps going, this time with Augie dropping the ball - again. The cast is actually making this work as a suspense factor, and it might just be working better than the overall plot line.The serial approach for this year is an improvement, but the lengthy ""previously on"" segments are a bit longer than necessary - especially in a world of internet where no one misses an episode anymore (or at least, not those of us who can't watch because of schedule, and pay for the downloads).Suggestion for the producers (are you listening Piper?) .... make the pay-for-downloads longer, extended versions an hour long. The plots will be less choppy and the characters more developed. You might be shocked at how many fans will pay for the downloads."
4,:),I love this series. Unfortunately they don't always post the new episodes on the shows website. Very glad I found it on amazon. a little cheaper since I will only watch it once. but at least I got to watch it before the new episode got released!
4,Good,Not my favorite episode but it was still good. Definitely needed in the plot development of this season. Looking forward to the rest of the season.
2,Covert Affairs season 3 has been really disappointing,Seasons 1 and 2 were great but season 3 has not come up to the first two seasons. Nothing memorable about it. I was buying season 3 on Amazon but stopped because the drama and intrigue just fell flat. Most TV shows are unbelievable but the progression of the plot seemed ridiculous.
5,The Last Thing you should do - Covert Affairs,Love this entire series. The acting is great and I love the tension between Annie and Auggie. But please don't put them together it ruins great shows.
5,better than I expected,"Love the plot twists, and intelligent writing...which is basically the kiss of death in TV, since most shows either get dumbed down, or cancelled."
5,"lighthearted,funny and entertaining","I have read all of Parnell Hall's Stanley Hastings mysteries. Scam lives up to his reputation as a funny, creative and inventive writer. The plot is so well-written that there are no loose ends at all-the entire Scam is like a sting operation. Ihope Mr. Hall's characters lives on and on"
4,"Good story, but a little hard to follow",I had to review the book to remember what it was about. Stock manipulaiton. I was as confused as Stanley. I still recommend the book. Just because it is Stanley and I cannot help but like him.
2,Save your time,"Simplistic, wordy and not very interesting. Only read it when I lacked anything else to read. Good thing it was free."
3,Mystery,"This book was light, easy read. Enjoyed the complications of the story. WOuld look for more books written by this author."
5,Worked with 1992 Sea Ray Marinco outlet,Perfect replacement for the outlet cover after the original cover was snapped off by an errant dock line.
3,"OK bag, a bit on the small side, and no handle","I got this bag for my Macbook Pro 15"". The style is nice, and the laptop fits OK, but I have one of the new compact power adapter and it still creates an annoying bulge in the bag. My major complaint though is that there is no carrying handle. I know that ""authentic"" messenger bags don't have a handle, but without the handle simple operations like grabbing the bag from the passenger seat of my car or shifting it from one seat to another on the train / plane / bus are awkward."
3,Not yet tried.,"I cannot rate this product since I have not used it yet. When I do plant the seeds this Spring, I will be happy to give you my feedback."
3,Finally some results.,I wouldn't recommend buying this product unless you plan to fertilize your soil or have some kind of germination device. I had minimal success with these seeds. I planted them in pots and am just seeing the first sprout after over a month. If you are new to planting things I'd recommend going with a fully formed plant.
1,Greenhouse - Jiffy pellets start and only one of 8 seeds -,and that one is sickly - into soil this week - shall see if the worm castings help at all!
4,2 year old loves it!,"A big hit! My children really love it. I was worried it wouldn't get use, but they even stand on it when they are playing other games!"
4,Well Made Balance Board Great for Youngsters,"This is a great choice for a balance board for little ones. The monkey graphics are colorful & cute. The construction is great - I weigh 200 lbs and it feels more that capable handling my weight. Assembly is easy and straightforward - 6 screws and you're done.An item like this ""is what it is"" so to speak: it's a balance board, and whether your child will play with it very much depends upon his or her interests and physical proclivities. My 3 year old daughter hasn't spent tons of time on it, but that isn't our expectation. A few minutes here or there will suffice to help her to develop her coordination. That's our goal, and this item meets our expectations wonderfully given it's cute design and quality construction."
4,Great for preschoolers,"My daughter is 5.5 years old and has Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). I thought that this would be a great toy for her since she has issues with her vestibular system. My daughter likes the balance board, but even with her SPD, it's not really challenging for her. On the other hand, my 3.5 year old loves it and finds it challenging to balance. It's much more entertaining for her age group. I would recommend this for preschoolers."
2,Hard to put together!,"This board seems to be constructed well, but I can't really tell as it's nearly impossible to put together. It claims to need only a phillips head screw driver, but alas, I can't get the screws in! I now have to find someone with a drill to help me. Boo."
1,Slick surface causes slip and falls!,We have had this toy for quite awhile now and my children when bare foot have fun on this board. But children sometimes forget to remove their socks before getting on the board and if they do be ready for a crash and tears. The surface of this board is so slick it has no traction on it at all. It needs something... I am truly surprised it hasn't been recalled especially after my daughter's fall last night. We thought she broke her arm at first. We are going to get rid of this toy. Not safe in my opinion! If you already own this board please be careful!
4,Monkey balance board,This is a decent toy for the price...We got it for our 4 year old for Christmas and it's still a little early to decide how much use he'll get out of it...He does get on it everday though so far...
1,Monkey Board no challenge for 2 1/2 year old,"This is a non-event toy. I purchased it after seeing a picture in a parenting magazine, but I have over the years buying toys, come to understand that the magazines just go by what the company sends them, and does not necessarily test the toys. This was a no event type toy for my 2 1/2 old. Quality good, but excitement factor and return-to-play-again factor extremely low."
5,balance board,"It is great for body coordination, body awareness, and a fun toy to strengthen the child's core. I use it for my child's sensory occupational therapy sessions."
1,Overpriced junk,Not worth the price. My Granddaughter immediately ignored the thing. Doesnt appear to be built strongly enough to hold up even if she had managed to be interested in the item. Avoid!
4,I like it,I like it. I can get on it as well. I wish it was a little more challenging though. It's not hard for me or the kids so it's almost like not challenging enough
4,Xmas gift,I was there when the present was opened. Initial reaction wasn't that strong but then both boys played with it later . Cute and keeps them active in the house.
2,Not for older toddlers.,"Thought my 4 year old son would enjoy this, but he grew bored with it quickly (within an hour). Too easy for him to ""balance."" Maybe if he was 2 years old he would have had more fun."
5,A success!,all the grand children from 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 mastered it and loved it. Now learning tricks! Hope the interest lasts.
5,Use this toy for work,I'm a Physical Therapist Assistant I provide home physical therapy for kids with special needs an this is a great toy! My kids absolutely love it when Alex comes out to play and it is super durable I can't tell you how many times I have dropped it or my kids have dropped it. There are quite a few dents and scratches on it now but I use it way more than the typical kid would. Good bright colors I have my kids tell me what color Alex's belly is or I will have them find his eyes and ears. Really great very durable good for gross motor and balance skills. Will buy again when mine finally breaks :)
3,Active 2 year old loved it for 10 minutes and is done,"My daughter is 2 and very active. She hardly sits down and likes to stand on her toys. So I thought this toy would be great. She loved it at first, but got bored with it. Maybe it is because she is on the go, go, go. It wasn't too hard to balance herself so it wasn't as fun."
4,My 4 year old is enjoying it for now,We gave this to my 4 1/2 year old son last week. He currently plays with it for short periods of time multiple times each day. He is not a super athletic kid (although not a klutz either) - but it really is too easy for him and I don't think he will be playing with it in a month.
2,My 3 yr old hated it,"The board requires a little bit of assembly (nothing complicated). I thought it was well made and durable. Unfortunately, my 3 yr old son hated it and would not play with it at all. I think it is still a good toy, just not the right purchase for my kid."
4,Balance board,My children have had so much fun with their balance boards. They seem very durable and easy to carry around.
4,"Description is wrong, this is the straight extension, not the curved one","This seller has a listing for the Pearl DR501E and the Pearl DR501CE and has the titles and descriptions swapped. This is not the curved extension, it is the straight one. I actually bought it suspecting that the items were swapped, since the ""straight"" extension was listed as $20 more than the curved one. I wanted the straight one anyway, but would have been happy to receive the curved one."
3,Knock-offs. 2001. Alien. etc.,"Didn't see many of these when they first ran. Reviewing them now, I'm kind of disappointed. Episode 7 seems a knockoff of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Episode 8 seems a knockoff of Alien. Lame gotchas at the end -- evil computer coming back to life in the last few seconds."
5,AWESOME,"David Phelps takes this album with some HUGE arragements, AWESOME vocals, even though he on the vocal band is reserving his high notes a little bit more than when he was younger, In this album we can hear that David Phelps that we love to see...And on the Opera side, the music is just angelical... Love it!"
5,David Phelps at his best.,I have been following David Phelp's career for years and I think this CD/DVD is absolutely his BEST work. He has an amazing voice whether singing Classical or Gospel. This CD/DVD is well worth the purchase price. I HIGHLY recommend this work.
3,Just okay,I like David's music but this album seemed a little too ambitious for his voice. I would buy his music again but I prefer that he stay with his tried and true gospel music.
1,Works great for a few seconds,"This truck works good until you hit something, then it seems to shut off. You need to turn the truck off and on. Then it works fine for a few seconds again. I pulled the battery to double check the connection and it seems to be fine, I see another review mentioning a similar problem. I'm not sure what's up with it, may have to return this if we can't keep it working."
2,what about the battery pack,It was not mentioned anywhere that you need a special battery pack for this truck. I only saw that you need a 9-volt. Now on christmas morning the truck is sitting. Not fun for my son. I will write to the company. It should come with the truck!!!
1,It broke on Christmas day!,I had the battery pack (sold separately) all charged and ready. It was a great toy for Christmas Eve but on Christmas morning IT BROKE! The heavy battery pack puts too much strain on the door (where the pack is) and it snapped. So did I! WAY too much money to spend on an easily breakable toy.
1,Disappointed,"This grand mama and her grandchildren were devastated today when the 2 Big Foot monster trucks were opened and there were no batteries to go with it.Since we live in a very rural area where batteries are not available within a 60 mile radius we were all very upset.There should be details on the web site to indicate that the trucks will not work without the correct batteries and chargers.While it is written on the box when you order on the internet there is no indication of batteries and charger not being included.Anna Cox, a sad and mad grandmama"
1,Don't be tempted....,"Most of the reviews are negative because of the battery not being included. That didn't bother me except that I bought this toy for $40 in Naples Florida, battery and charger not included. In Indianapolis, it cost $40 including the battery. The battery and charger I bought separately was $20. So, there are two versions out there. Anyway, after charging up the battery for five hours as required, the truck ran for about 10 minutes. It would randomly not work. I returned it to the store where they exchanged it with no hassle. I brought home the new one and it was worse. It runs for about 10 seconds then quits. I believe it is a design flaw. The truck would always work again after turning it off then back on, but only for a few seconds. I charged up the battery again with no improvement. I am extremely disappointed for my 5 year old who we bought this for. It's a shame too because this toy is well built and very fast otherwise."
1,replacement parts unavailable,This truck works great and has been fun for my son until the tires got holes in them and we found out that there are no replacement parts available. It's not much use without its tires.
4,Deceptive packaging,"This toy was purchased as a birthday gift for my Grandson's 5th birthday. Nowhere on the box does it say the 9.6 V charger is required for operation of toy. Therefore, he was not able to play with his monster truck. All other remote control toys include this charger. Your advertising is very deceptive and this charger should be included with the truck. Would you purchase a new car and then be told you have to purchase tires separately before you can drive the new car home???"
1,Total Waste Of Money,"Major disappointment. Doesn't come with a battery pack or a charger. After going through the trouble of finding the battery, waiting several hours to charge it, the car (I bought two that behaved the same) would only run for few seconds then stops. Have to toggle power switch and wait few seconds for it to turn on again. Total disappointment..."
1,"Horrible value, batteries not included","This product is not worth the time to write a bad review. There are lots of better choices out there, most with batteries. Go pick one."
2,Not indestructable!,"Not only was I disappointed that the vehicle didn't include the battery pack which we purchased for another $30, but my 7 year old son ran it through a large water puddle in the yard after 15 minutes of playing time and now it doesn't work at all! For an outdoor toy, it would seem reasonable to expect a child would drive it through puddles and that it would still work!"
3,Battery Charger and Tire Pump,"Haven't been able to play with it yet. I too am disappointed a battery & charger weren't included. I bought a remote control car last year from Radio Shack for about the same price; everything included. ALSO, in the instructions,but no where on the box or on Amazon,it also says you should have a tire pump to keep them inflated to optimal size. And it's not a regular tire pump that you might use for your bike. I just got on Amazon to find/buy the pump and haven't found it yet. Looks like Radio Shack will be getting a visit/$$ from me."
1,Also disappointed about no charger/battery pack,"My 4 year old received this truck for Christmas from his grandparents. To everyone's dismay he still can't play with it because none of us realized it needs a charger and battery pack. One would assume for the price of this toy that it was included. As with another reviewer, we too purchased an off-brand r/c Jeep truck from Wal-mart for $20, and it INCLUDED the charger and battery pack. Unfortunately, they aren't compatible with this truck. Amazon/Toysrus should have indicated the need to purchase the charger/battery pack upfront in the toys description."
3,"Like the toy, mad about the charger","Like all the others, I bought this for my step son, and didn't notice it came WITHOUT the charger. Was a bit upset by this, saw no notice, and had to run around looking CHRISTMAS EVE for the stupid charger. Wish they would include it, or at least write in BIG letters that the charger wasn't included. Works well, and he loves it, but the charger issues really irritated me."
5,Works as expected.,"Works very well, just keep in mind that installation costs can be quite high. I did everything myself and due to the distance (cannot be over 6ft) from the battery, the connectors and wire cost another $100."
4,Nice to see these back in circulation,"I concur with the other reviewers --- what one gets here is a pretty no-nonsense, no-frills interpretation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I find that a straightforward approach doesn't necessarily have to equate with the sometimes robotic stiffness one can find in Heifetz. Francescatti has a cleaner, lighter tone --- more lyrical than I think Heifetz ever managed.The sound quality is good --- no complaints on that end. The biggest liability would have to be the rather unruly & sometimes downright undisciplined playing of the New York Philharmonic under Thomas Schippers, although this should probably be considered par for the course.The Santa Fe no doubt is correct --- this will appeal mostly to Francescatti devotees. One can only hope that it might serve to reintroduce a younger generation of listeners to Francescatti's playing. Overall, it is a good, well-presented, affordable CD. One could do much much worse."
3,True Fans are WATCHING,"Wow, it took for Jay to retire and for use to get this once hard to fine movie on dvd. If you are a true fan you may have this on vhs. For most who don't know or just becoming a Jay-Z fan, this one cd gave Jay his street credit back. Some thought that In My lifetime:VOL 1 was a little soft(Sunshine) but to date outside of Resonable Doubt,blueprint, and the black album vol 1 will always be a classic to me. The Streets are Watching just gave us the sound that we first heard when we all got a resonable doubt.For true Jay-Z fans this and Fade to Black are a must have to get to know the humble yet cocky rapper. You can add Backstage to the list only if you want to hear about Ja Rule, DMX, Beenie Segal, and Memphis Bleek."
2,Causes staining to my dog's neck,"The collar looked nice when it was new, but after a couple of months the chrome finish started to flake off and the fur on my dog's neck was turning black from the chain rubbing on it -- even though the collar was not too tight. Decided to go with a martingale collar without the chain."
3,just so so,"I was alittle disapointed with the sound, really don't like the way your player is upside down when docked, makes it hard to read. Don't think I would have picked it if I have seen it and tryed it in a store before buying."
3,better battery system,nice design works nice but gets fuzzy when you turn the volume up and it eats batteries the weaker the batteries the worst the fuzz gets
2,a little disappointed,"my own fault, i did not research this product fully ... i expected a plug in wall type charger unit ... the product your supposed to purchase for this is way to heavy/big/more money than i'm prepared to spend in that the sound of the speakers isn't all there & the resort we're staying at probably has a clock radio to plug into ...(just being honest here)cc"
3,"Great Portability, Mediocre SOund.","This is a well built, ultra compact unit. We bought it to have music on the beach while in St. Martin. It works fine, sound quality isjust OK."
5,Great sound and cool appearance.,"I think this is a great choice because it is not just a pair of speakers. The sound is great, you can use it for small mp3 players or bigger ones. I don't have an ipod shuffle but if i had one i can use the traveldock to charge it, i like having that option. The appearance is very cool!"
3,Enjoyable Movie,Very funny comedy. One that the guys and their girlfriends can enjoy.The sexual comedy in this movie is definitely something that will keep you interested.
1,More about Waits than about the Unabomber,"The content of this book is thin, if you want a full picture of Kaczynski. This is only about the Kaczynski that the author slightly knew during his 25 years of reclusive Montana living, and there is a great deal more detail about Waits' life in the mountains, and his competition with the FBI about uncovering Unabomber clues, than I cared to know. The NEW YORK TIMES at the time of Kaczynski's capture really gave more biographical information overall, and that was not a lot."
5,We're Talking About Facts,"This review is in reference to the review by Strauss (It's An OK Book). Strauss's main point is that the book presents a good picture of Kaczynski. He should be familiar with the letter from Kaczynski that was published in the Helena Independent Record (Waits's publisher) that claimed Waits was lying about knowing Kaczynski, how is it possible for him to write about him. Answer: Not very. This book is hokum, and Waits is after the money, not truth."
4,insights into a manipulator's mind,"Yes, Waits is pretty full of himself, but the best part of this book is seeing in the personality of Kaczynski, his scorn for fellow humans because they aren't as smart, and how he ""became"" what would work best for each person he dealt with. It reminded me of Ted Bundy, who was so charming when he wanted to be. Wonder if he also went home and wrote out his scorn in diaries..."
1,this book is unbelievable,"I read this book and have a hard time believing the FBI would be so lax as to let a civilian have copies of Ted's journals even before trial, maybe let him see certain parts of the journals pertaining to McClellan Gulch, but definatly not let him have copies. Also, did you pick up on the fact that the evidence Chris Waits claimed to have found in the ""secret cabin"" was not important enough to the FBI for them to collect it and save it for the trial? Only Waits thought it was important and that he was important to the investigation. After reading it, I have doubts about the authentisity of the supposed evidence. Is the FBI so incompetient they cannot recognize important evidence when they see it?"
5,A fascinating look at the effects of urban sprawl on one man,"A lot of new info for me, and I live only 30 miles from Kaczynski's former home in Montana. I didn't know he wanted a sex change, nor did I know how much of a local terrorist he really was, not to mention sicko. This book is a great read and written from a true insider's perspective, not that of a distant journalist hoping to make a fast buck. It's a fascinating story, albeit creepy. Watch for the made-for-TV movie."
1,who is this book about,"I have just read this book. The only life I see here is Chris Waits. He does not tell many stories as to how he knew Ted, he only goes on and on how he helped the FBI who seemed to be too dumb to take his evidence. Was his evidence real."
5,No Excuse for Ted,"but hey, this Chris Waits is a fascinating guy. Made for interesting reading and emphasized how the rich yuppies are really messing up the great wide open spaces."
1,This book deserves NO stars: It's a bad joke.,Poorly written. Unconvincing. I don't believe Waits' story and suspect it's the work of a very common opportunist. Don't waste your time or money.
1,The Secret Lies of Chris Waits,"I have read this book twice, along with keeping up on all of the Unabomber trial and incedents. I found that Chris contradicts himself in a television interview when Ted was first arrested. Chris, in the interveiw, claims being Ted's best friend. Now in his book, he makes mention of the few people who do keep in contact with him as being ""bad christians"" ect. I just find that if this man is going to turn the other cheek so quickly, then he probably isn't very truthful."
2,Dissapointing!,"I own an outstanding '50 Mystery Classics' where almost every movies was watchable. By contrast, '50 Hollywood Legends' contains was below average collection of movies that I would not want to waste my time on. With the exception of 'The Joyless Street' with Garbo and 'Blood and Sand' with Valentino, I coonsider this a waste regardless of the attractive price. Not recommended."
2,Films Included Have Changed,"Mainly want to update Bderoes excellent list to say that my recent set seems to have had three films exchanged for others, so I assume this is now standard for the set -Gold,Good News, andLets Live a LittleHAVE BEEN REMOVED, to be replaced by -The Road To Bali w/ Hope & Crosby,Scarlet Street w/ Edward G Robinson, andPied Piper Of Hamelin (1957 TV Movie) w/ Van Johnson.Roger Moore is still listed on the front cover, but doesn't now appear.I have to agree with other reviews that this is a poorer set than some others in the series, with a high number of films running at least 10min too short."
1,Bad movies at a good price,"I have purchased 50 movie pack before & loved it. The movies were good, decent condition, etc. So I decided to try the 50 movie pack of Hollywood Legends. While there are some good movies: ""Smash-up: Story of a Woman"", ""Penny Serenarde"", etc, most of these movies are cheap B rated movies. While I do give credit that not all movies are ""Oscar"" worthy, but enjoyable to watch nonetheless, most of these movies were a torture to watch. Who knew that ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" was a Hollywood Legend. Come on now, give me a break. Also, there were a few silent movies on here (if you like silent movies, then this is a plus), and some old TV movie shows that were done on a cardboard stage & you can hear the hallowed halls echo throughout the movie.For me, I wish I saved my money or bought another pack, cause this one was definitely not worth it at all."
4,old movie fan,"I liked the collection of old movies, some were better than others but for the money it provided alot of entertainment and I enjoyed seeing some stars in their earliest and mosly forgotten roles. Well worth the money."
1,this 50 pack is really the pits,"i own most of these 50 pack movies,and as i have said most are very good,but,this one is the pits.i know for the price you shouldn't grip about quality or the severe edits done to these movies,but other sets weren't edited like this. and the quality of the transfers are far below the standerds that the other 50 packs have been. many more like this and i'll stop buying these sets."
3,Definitely Not One of Ms.Chaikins better.........,"Though it's an interesting tale,...I couldn't help but be disappointed. I loved the first two books... and I feel somewhat disappointed in the third. I felt that Rogan and Evy were not the same characters than in the previous two books. Your focus is no longer on Evy and Rogan,.. but on other characters.(Which is a good thing,... but I almost stopped caring as to what happens to Rogan and Evy!) Though it's an interesting mystery and I enjoyed that aspect of it, I can't say it's an equal to Ms.Chaikin's previous works."
4,This book...,was alright. I have read the first two books in this series. I loved the first one and liked the second book. So I ordered this one and found that it wasn't really good. I hate to say that but I didn't really care about it. It seemed as if Ms Chaikin had a deadline to meet and just put some things together and made a book. She jumps around to many peoples view points and then just tries to make it all work. I was really disappointed in this book. You read the description of this book and think it's about how Evy and Rogan work though there problem and build a stronger relationship while some hardships of Africa come about. It's not really. I can't say any more that that I was so disappointed in this book. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I like other things Ms Chaikin has written.
1,Not received,"I was excited to get these books at such a great price. Problem is, I never received them.I have not been refunded any of my money either. They supposedly shipped on 8-26. As of 9 - 27 still nothing. Not sure I will ever purchase from here again."
3,"Contains many typos, and innacurate information","This book, is useful... but has many many flaws. In the back there are practice pages, and many of them have typos and inaccurate information. The book contains many typos that are cumbersome if one is just learning. The CD was useful, and has many fun games to help one with the terminology. I would say the CD was much more helpful than the actual book. Despite the fact, I still would not recommend this book."
1,comprehensive medical terminology 2nd edition by delmar,this is not a paperback book like it says it is all you get is an acess code. Tried two times to get the actual book sent to me for a college class that had already started..I never was able to get an actual book for the class and amazon had to refund my money
3,Nice but colors are not as advertised,The 'light grey' stripes are in fact 'light blue' and a little feminine but I still dig the jacket regardless.
4,Review,"I just got it a couple days ago. Although I ordered the small size, it is still very large for me. I am 5'10 and 150 lbs. They should have smaller size I think. Overall, I like it, and now try to find the way to shrink in the dryer"
2,Poorly thought out execution,"Although this an inexpensive tray, I expected a little bit better execution. It's hard to tell from the picture, but the slots for utensils are very narrow, with large flanges meant to be trimmed to size surrounding them. But no one would need a tray with flanges THAT big, that wouldn't need a larger amount of storage space in the tray, too. There is over an inch and a half of flange per side, and more at the top/bottom. And it is very thick plastic, which is the nice part, until you start to trim it. You need a saw - scoring it with a blade won't be enough, unless you have the strength of Zeus, and it has no ""pre-scored"" grooves molded on the back to help. So you have a tray made to fit up to a 12"" drawer, with only 8"" of usable space, and it takes a power saw to trim it to size. A poor design, in my opinion."
4,For emergency use,"I have one of these power inverters for those instances (about 3 times/year)of power losses from rain- or snow-storms. Between my car, the car battery and the power inverter, I have the equivalent of a generator. Be sure to determine the wattage of the electrical devices that will be powered. A 32""-TV will require about 190 watts; floor- or desk lamps require about 75 watts each; a laptop computer needs about 47 watts. A 25-cuft side-by-side refrigerator uses about 750 kilowatt-hours per year (about 85 watts average; 170 watts ""surge"" when the compressor kicks in )"
3,Before you buy,"This item is not compatible with a cigarette lighter. I bought one and it came with two connectors to attach directly to the terminals on a car battery. The instruction manual specifically states that the 700 unit cannot be powered by a cigarette lighter, but the smaller 400 and 175 models can."
3,Good but what the description doesn't say,What the description does not say (and why I give it only 3 stars) is that it has a maximum continuous output of 560 watts. This is right below the limit of what I need. So don't buy this is 560 isn't enough. Other than that it works just fine and it gives a nice annoying alarm when the source battery charge drops--either that or it was a thermal alarm.I now get to do more research and find an inverter that actually will put out 700 watts continuous. (Looking at the Black-Decker-750-Watt-Inverter which says it handles 750w continuous and peaks at 1500 or maybe the Coleman 800w Power Inverter which peeks at 1600w.)
5,Easily the quietest unit I've ever owned.,"I've owned upwards of 10 power inverters and none even come close to the reliability. Easily the quietest unit I've ever owned. The only down side is there isn't any mounting brackets or holes to mount it. Had to use some Velcro strips, they worked quite well. Something else to keep in mind is that the 700-Watt model can't be hooked up via cigarette lighter nor would you want to do that even if you could. Inverters work much better hardwired and for this model it is a must. Great Product Great Price - 5 Stars"
4,Excelent produc,"Bery good produc, but you can't used in to the cars because you do not put in to the cigarett light"
1,This product may causes SRS issue with certain vehicles,"I used this product on my Honda Odyssey 2002. This casue the SRS light lit on. I brought the van to Honda Dealer and they said this took away the power from the vehicle that cause the SRS module failure. The cost to repair may upto $800.I plan to return this product to Amazon.What is the return process?Thanks,Peter"
3,power inverter review,it worked and delivered power to power the video game we need it to run. but the cooling fan didnt work rite out of the box.
3,Its not 700 Watts continuous.,Looks like this inverter is not 700Watts continuous like every other inverter is specified. It can handle 700 Watts only for 5 min and 560W continuous. They should have put continuous power in the spec.
5,Academic detective work & translating at its best!,"What a treat to read these early letters! Mews compelling argues, based upon impeccable scholarship, that what we have here is a bona fide glimpse into the developing relationship between two of the medieval world's most interesting philosophers. Heloise's letters compel me to reconsider the views expressed in A History of Women Philosophers Volume 2 regarding Heloise's sexual interest in Abelard, while clarifying the fact that she took the doctrine of the morality of intention much more seriously than did Abelard. The letters clearly show that while Abelard taught Ciceronian/Tullian moral philosophy to Heloise, she practiced it while he did not. And for those who have no interest in philosophy?? Read one of the greatest love stories never told, straight from the mouths of the lovers themselves."
3,Wonderful Texts & Translations,"Mews makes a less than satisfying case for the authorship of the letters: it's not as if the two famous lovers were the only teacher / pupil passion of the Middle Ages, and authenticating this sort of thing is tricky business. Calling it the ""lost letters of Heloise and Abelard"" is a bit romantic, I think. If you're into historical certainties, this may prove irritating.Mews is more persuasive when she writes about what the letters show us about medieval love and its dialogics.But the letters don't have to be those of Heloise and Abelard to be a ripping good read. Especially if you're looking for some practice translating medieval Latin, the book is very satisfying: the Latin is not very difficult, and translations on the facing page make a sure pony (and are lovely in their own right)."
2,Look Elsewhere,"Nautical Antiques is a book of well described excellent photographs by an author whose qualifications are that he observed ships from the dock as a child. There is little history, context, significance or scholarship provided. See American Nautical Art and Antiques by Jacqueline Kranz (1975) for the opposite of what little Robert W. D. Ball has given us."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"This DVD was a huge disappointment. It does credit neither to Orde Wingate nor to BBC. It is extremely difficult to follow, even if one knows the story. The movie is done like a videoed stage play with very strange, austere sets, too few actors, incomprehensible scene shifts between Burma in 1943-44 back and pre-WWII Palestine, and an over-emphasis on Wingate's eccentricities at the expense of his military achievements and contributions to modern warfare. Obviously a very low budget enterprise. The real Wingate story has yet to be told in film."
1,terrible,"This is a terrible work. The history as presented is completely wrong. The portrayal of Wingate bears no resemblance to the real man or his real life. Important events are glossed over or are at odds with history. The actors are not at all at fault, but the material they have been given is.What you get is a coloring-book stage play version of the life of Wingate with all the unpleasent bits carefully ignored. The worst decision being to over-emphesize earier parts of his life while almost ignoring the events of 1942-43 which constituted his rise to fame.The cover of the DVD has a clean-shaven head looking out into the distance. The real wingate ran around camp in Burma naked eating raw onions sometimes with an alarm clock around his neck. Its unfortunate that such fine actors were cast into this most unworthy production."
5,Overview,John Moy has caputured the whole OSPF implementation in a graphical easy to read format. Technically without equal and the simulation program only emphasises his knowledge.Don't waste time reading other OSPF books this is the real thing.
4,Still going.........,"After the torture this vehicle has been put through by my son and his cousin, it's not broken and still runs as new. Incredible toy - thought they have lost the action figure."
1,Why does Spirderman need a car?,"Okay this is just terrible. Why does Spiderman need a car? He can shoot webs out of his wrists and swing from building to building. This is just like Flash's motorcycle. Really? A man that can run at the speed of light needing a motorcyle.... Its like Superman needing to take a Space Shuttle or almost as bad as the Spiderman Grappling hook. This must be Manufactured by the Department of Redundancy Department. Plus I highly doubt Spiderman is going to come charging into battle with a car blazing all 5 of his missles and then what; start running people over? Not to mention he is going to get stuck in traffic trying to get to a crime scene instead of swinging there. 1 RPG and that car is toast, literally. Then what? What good is a missle launcher when you're car is on fire and the controls are busted? As a person who reads comics this is one of the worst toys ever in my opinion."
4,"Good, But Not Great","I bought this book with high hopes, and did enjoy it. But. It does bounce around, from the fascinating history of flattery to great tips about flattery to research concerning flattery.There's much to be learned from this book, and I'm glad I bought it, but I can't really say it's an enjoyable read. It's just not laid out well."
2,Flippancy and Flattery,"This book makes some good points and includes some interesting perspectives on flattery and grovelling. At the same time, it is decidedly ""popular"" rather than scholarly. The most irritating aspect of the book is the author's breezy flippancy; he tries much too hard to be much too clever, and the result is merely tiresome. I wish I could have checked this out of the library for a few days instead of buying it. For those with a serious interest in the subject, Alfons Silbermann's ""Grovelling and Other Vices"" is clearly superior."
3,And that's a generous 3 star rating,"It's meticulously researched and comprehensive, tracing flattery and flatterers throughout time: ancient Egypt, Rome, and Greece, then the Middle Ages, early American colonial times, all the way through the 1990s. The author digresses from time to time and seems to instruct the reader on how to flatter, but the biggest flaw is that the book is boring. He throws in a few pop culture references here and there, but not enough to compensate for the books overall dryness."
5,AWESOME LEGO!!,"I bought one with my allowance and have ABSOULUTLEY NO REGRETS!!This is an awesome toy, but don't grt it unless you are going to play with it.It comes with a rebel soldier and turret and the speeder with Luke and his co-pilot (That's Dak for all you star wars buffs).Again it is an awesome toy.If you really want some fun, then start saving up for the AT-AT so that you can use the tow cable.As anybody who has legos (and siblings) knows, legos can be broken easily, but this one stays together pretty well."
5,A story of Big Love at it's finest,"Sanctuary, by Brenda Novak, is a well-researched book about polygamy and the effects of polygamy on its followers both in the sect and those who have left the sect. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. All of her characters are believable, and realistic. I find the subject of polygamy to be a timely one in light of the new HBO series, ""Big Love."" For me, as a Mormon, it strikes a familiar chord even though The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints discontinued the practice of polygamy in 1890, when in order to become a state, Utah was forced to outlaw the practice. Brenda treats any intimacy between her characters in a discreet and tasteful way. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a good, entertaining, and educational read. Brenda is an awesome writer."
4,Poignant-a sure winner with a creepy backdrop,"If you start this book near dinnertime, I practically guarantee you'll be ordering pizza! You just can't put this one down.This book had three distinct elements that set it apart from an ""ordinary"": a romance with an insurmountable problem, the search for a child relinquished for adoption, intertwined with an extremely well researched look into the world of polygamy.The community of Hope's origin was downright creepy-and from what I understand, quite realistic. I actually shuddered at some of the twisted statements made by the polygamous characters. The entire concept creeped me out...yet it set the tone for helping us understand Hope's strength and motivation to help her sister into a simple, peaceful life based on her own decisions. Brenda Novak manages to enforce that tone but without it overtaking the romantic and heartwarming elements of the story.Makes me grateful for my wonderful husband, too...my ONE wonderful husband!!"
2,"Probably broken, new version coming out soon anyway.","I love FLCL and I decided to purchase this DVD set from a local store for far less then anyone on Amazon is selling it now, (about $60-$80). It has amazing extras and features, however there is one issue: The first disc is often broken.I kept returning my broken set, and in each one I opened the first disc was starting peel apart, causing minor skipping, but with potential to get worse in the future. The store went through all 12 copies they had, and they were all broken in the same way. According to them, many sets were returned to the distributors, and the set has been officially discontinued.Good News though, Funimation has picked it up, and will be re-releasing the series on DVD and Blue-ray later this year. You should probably wait for that to come out. Here's Funimation's official site for FLCL: [..]"
1,Why do we Pirate? Cost Cost Cost!,"OK. So FLCL is quite possibly the best all-around anime series ever. But let's face facts...these are outrageously overpriced. Yes, I know...the production values, etc.Can I clue you all into something?TV shows don't make money if they're not on TV. So the producers of TV shows make sure they make $$$ upon delivery. They aren't waitng for some pie-in-the-sky success to come along, a cult hit so they can sell DVDs for hundreds of dollars. That doesn't pay the bills.Gainax made their money off FLCL a long time ago. This is price gouging pure and simple. I will not participate. This is why people pirate.(Note: I will not be downloading this show. Gainax can go F themselves.)"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I love Excel Saga and watched this after hearing comparisons. FLCL seems comparitively americanized and ""emo"". The main character's narration is a poor imitation of The Wonder Years and My So-Called Life. It's also often hard to tell the difference between a developing plot point and a contextless gag because the story jumps around so much."
2,You Definitely Need a Guide in Order to Understand This Series,"Another reviewer (""There IS a Plot"") mentions a guide to the plot, characters, etc. I certainly couldn't make sense of this series, so I guess I need the guide. The manga anime is well done, but every time I thought the show was finally making some sense, it crumbled into total confusion again in short order. I watched it all and still don't get it. Good luck!"
5,Nothing Amazing Ever Happens Here,"I got this box set back in 2006 and it is spectacular.Each episode comes with full English subtitles, selective subtitles (a lot of the humor is scrawled out on the screen in katakana Japanese) and with picture-in-picture story boarding as well as English and Japanese audio.The extras and English-language commentary are compelling and hilarious at times.Is the show hilarious?Yes.Is it an exemplary sample of modern anime?Certainly.Is the ""Ultimate Edition"" worth $400?That's for you to decide. All I can tell you is that the quality of this DVD collection will not disappoint.Now do I have the slightest idea what this damn show is about?Not a clue."
4,Nice tool,I have two of them for gardening. It is handy and good at home. Suggestuon: buy an extra battory with the initial purchasing.
5,works dandy......,this little tool works great...it's super sharp and holds a charge for a substantial amount of time...worth every penny.
4,Charger/transformer cannot be replaced,"This is an excellent grass shear. Its battery charge is long-lasting and the shear itself is durable. However, I recently had to replace the entire unit because the charger (either the transformer or its connecting wire, which is quite flimsy) broke and would no longer charge the unit. I tried very hard to find a source online for a new part but was unable to do so. The company's website would not allow me to contact them to seek information on a replacement. It seems a shame to have such an excellent shear but be unable to get replacement parts for the charger."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product after reading reviews on Amazon, like I do for most of my purchases.Sadly, I have to agree with the people who DID NOT recommend it.It does not last, and more important, it does not cut all of the grass that ends up in between the blades.Doing things twice is not on my time schedule.This product should not have passsed quality control."
1,Untimely and slow death,"I bought the 3"" and 4"" based on the strong reviews they received. Initially I was pleased with both: They were lighter and quieter than my Black and Decker and easier to handle. But in less than six months for both the battery life decreased significantly despite the full charge it received and the cleaning I did religiously to the blades. The 4"" used to cover twice the area of my 3""; but now it covers less area than the 3"" did in its prime. The 3"" is a year old and no longer of any use in its sputterings; the 4"" probably won't be alive to happily celebrate its first birthday, either. My Black and Decker (an older model) gave me five strong years but I hear the newer models are junk. Now I'm back to manual cutters. Don't waste your money on American Gardneners!"
5,Superb reference for MS Network and Winsock API's.,"I purchased this book for coverage of the Winsock 2.0 API and found it to be an excellent Winsock API Reference and much more. The text was very well laid out. I'm a C/C++ programmer as well as a beginner VB programmer, and I too thought the examples were clear, practical, and to the point. I disagree with dave's comment below and woudl recommend this book to anyone interested in learning network programming on the Window's environment."
5,The Windows Networking Standard,"Authors tend to obfuscate topics they don't entirely grasp; and very few master the intricacies of difficult subjects, especially those such as network programming. Jones is to Windows programming what Stevens was to Unix. Here you will find, concise language, solid experience and real-world industrial-strength examples. Especially notable is the extensive coverage of the various I/O models and their applications. If you have only one book on network programming in your library... Make it this one!"
4,2nd edition concentrates on sockets,"I was surprised when I got this book. I had seen the first edition, which covered, in addition to sockets, NetBIOS, Mailslots, and Named Pipes. In the second edition these last 3 ""Legacy APIs"" are moved exclusively to the CDROM that's included. It seemed strange to me for a book's back cover to claim that it covers those legacy APIs, yet it not to be covered in the hard copy. And it seems especially strange, since the only mention of this is in the book's introduction: says they were moved there ""because of space considerations"". Yet I have two other books from MS Press that also retail for [same price] and are well over 1000 pages. Anyway, I just wanted to warn anyone that maybe had the same expectations that I did.Nevertheless, what's in the book is good, up-to-date information on Windows sockets, including new stuff on Windows XP, IPv6, and a chapter using C#."
1,Of No Useful Help,"This book is merely a compilation of copied-and-pasted text from various web sites, as it seems. The authors do not focus on trying to help the reader understand how winsock works, but instead try to glean over a few details while at the same time straying from the topic at hand.The book is poorly written, with several typos abounding. As is often from a Microsoft Press book, this text does not strive to help the reader.If you are trying to find a book that will help you learn how to write code for programming network applications, this book is definitely not for you! If, on the other hand, you would like to read brief descriptions of winsock and not actually understand how it works, this book is written for you in mind."
1,"Not a clear, practical guide to MS Net APIs.","I'm a VB programmer desperately seeking information on the NETAPI functions. There is nothing on the web, Dan Appleman has nothing to say about the the NetAPI and there's definitely nothing in this book on it. The VB world needs someone, like Appleman to go through and document this scarcely documented topic."
2,Research this before you buy it.,"Mine would maintain a charge for only a few hours, where it is supposed to last for 10+ days. It also overheated in the charging cradle to the point where the batteries melted into the holder, and the battery cover deformed. I burned my fingers trying to get the batteries out - this was VERY hot. I got a Razor Diamondback to replace it - didn't even want to screw with Logitech - I just got my money back."
5,Awesome mouse,"I've had this since it came out and I've had no problems. Right now, being 5ish years old it has trouble responding. I got new rechargeable batteries for it because the ones that came with it finally died and they work extremely well. Just make sure you get the right ones. NiMh I believe. Anyways, I use this mouse for gaming and it has 8 buttons, which work great for tossing primary and secondary grenades, switching weapons, and anything else really. I went to see how much it would be to replace this exact one and it looks as if the price went up since it originally was. All in all the best mouse I've ever used!"
5,Best desktop mouse I have owned!,We have had our MX700's for over a year and it has been the best mouse we have had. NEVER any issues with great response and accuracy. I am an avid gamer so this is important! I have read the other negative reviews here and I have to wonder if the real issues were with the users. This is highly recommended for a desktop PC.07/07/2008 Update... STILL own it and STILL LOVE IT!!.
2,MX700 Cordless SPASTIC Rechargeable Opical Mouse,"For the most part this is a poor performing cordless mouse. It's movements are FREQUENTLY SPASTIC when playing games and TOO OFTEN it is difficult to properly seat the mouse in its recharger base - such that you are not sure if the batteries are actually recharging. Early on I 'discovered' this the hard way with a 'dead mouse' in the recharger base the next time I tried to use it (it took ~a day to properly recharge.) MAKE SURE THE GREEN LIGHT ON THE MOUSE IS ON OR FLASHING AFTER YOU PLACE IT IN THE CHARGING BASE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MANIPULATE THE MOUSE BACK-AND-FORTH AND UP-AND-DOWN IN THE BASE MANY TIMES UNTIL THIS HAPPENS. On a positive note, I'm still using the original rechargeable batteries after two and 1/2 years. I'm switching to a laser optics cordless mouse - unfortunately, sooner than I would like!"
4,$23.64 for Maxgrip,I picked up a handful of Maxgrip wrenches during the 4for3 promo and created a great set of sturdy comfortable tools.
3,"not bad book,ok film","not the best book I have read,but does give the right feel of being in a submarine during ww2,also what it`s like on the african coast,a rough sea and rocky coastline.Try and get the movie is another hard luck story,never on vhs or dvd,some tv showings in last 30years but not often,but is now possible to buy in the uk,from private sellers,and is up to dvd standard,read the book first,as film jumps over alot of the story,honor blackmans good in it,ok flick for a winters day."
5,KILLA KLAN ALBUM,"This is not a solo Album this is a compilation of artist from the Famous KILLA KLAN from H-town,TX. Street military,Fakkulty,BAM,Z-RO,Guerilla MAAB, Gang society,Burton boyz,Mafia Geni and others make this album worth buying.G-rapp does all the production and is very talented. Pick this one up!"
4,12V Bulbs,"These bulbs worked great in our Tree Topper! The only issue I had with them was the price, kinda high for a 5 pack of minis. It must be due to them being 12V and not 2.5V. Received the product in a timely fashion and in great condition."
4,For All Seasons,"Rick and Robin are soulmates,but the tragedy is that they are both fughting leukemia...this book's going to make some people cry so be sure the tissue box is full and close by.I almost gave this amazing story 5 stars.Only Jean Ferris' talk of God made me lower it...for the reason that I'm not too sure she likes Him.Robin's virginity issue couldn't have been handled more tastefully.Invincible Summer follows Rick and Robin's relationship through each of the 4 seasons.This is a beautiful and gripping story but expect it to end with a question mark."
1,Seller JanRic Marketing SOLD DEFECTIVE product AND did not care to reply to emails.,"I bought this product which had a software on a 1.44 MB floppy. No modern computers have floppy drives and this aspect was not described in product details. I would have never bought this product if product description was complete.I sent 3-4 emails and SELLER JanRic Marketing DID NOT RESPOND.I bought an external floppy drive, an extra expenditure so that I can run the floppy. The floppy was defective and did not run as I checked the external drive with other floppies and it opened those floppies perfectly.I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SELLER (JanRic Marketing). DID NOT RESPOND AND DID NOT REFUND MY AMOUNT. ON TOP OF THAT I MADE AN EXTRA EXPENSE TO CHECK THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT."
3,something's wrong here,a good anaysis of the current legal system and how we're bound not to do whats best in response to the probabilty of being sued
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This Pile of Dung!,"Well, it is beautiful... I will give it that. I guess that is worthy of a 1 out of 5. If amazon gave me a choice though, I would have given it I a zero! I got to step six on its assembly (placing the counterweight on the tone arm). Not only does it not even come close to fitting, trying to ""screw the counterweight on counter-clockwise"", resulted in breaking off the rear portion of the tone arm. What a pile of $500 garbage! It is, literally, useless to me now and will be making its way into my dumpster in a few minutes... I should have known better than to stray from my good luck with the Rega RP-1... Avoid this s***pile at all costs!"
3,Looks better than it works,"I bought this turntable to convert a bunch of my old vinyl into digital files and CDs. I'd say it was only moderately successful, and not without a lot of trial and error. First of all, my local retailer had to open every box to make sure the turntable worked, he said there is a high failure rate. These tables are made in Eastern Europe. Mine worked, but I could not get the tracking right. I followed the instructions carefully, but it was still very light, and skipped easily. I took it back, and we used a tracking gauge, which showed we had to use a much higher force than indicated on the tracking dial on the tonearm. Even then, I would say the sound is good but not great, not as good as the Bang & Olufsen it replaced (I needed a manual table for recording). It's too bad there are no mid-price quality turntables anymore, just the $79 junkboxes and $500 and up audiophile equipment."
5,Funny show,I am very glad that this show is on DVD and hope the other seasons will be released soon. I used to love watching this show on Fox when it was its first run on the air and I am very pleased with this set. It comes in a 4 disc set. Haven't had a chance to watch the special features on this discs yet but it looks good and features the cast looking back over season one and their characters. I highly recommend this dvd if you want plenty of laughs because this show is too funny!
5,This Show is Funny As Hell,Living Single well have u in tears from the beginning to the end. I love this show
5,This show starts with greatness!!!,I dont usually buy seasons 1 and 2 or 3 of some shows- because the characters and actors still need time to become confortable with the everything-but this show starts off PERFECT- a lot of the shows i thought was in the 3 and 4th season were in the 1st- and it gets better by season- simply awesome- if u thinking about buying it- GO AND GET IT- its WAAY worth it :)
5,QUESTION re: LIVING SINGLE (THE COMPLETE SERIES),"How many more years before THE COMPLETE LIVING SINGLE SERIES is available? In this lifetime I hope, MY GOODNESS, SMDH?!!?"
5,Where is the second season of Living Single????,Does anyone know when the second season will be released? This was one of my favorite shows.. I miss the 90's!!!!!!
5,One of the best shows,I miss this show really bad. I can't get enough of it:(We need the complete seriesQueen make it happen for your fans please:)
4,living single,the dvds are great i would like to order more my family and i love them very much. dennis dones thanks for having a web sight to order these tv sit-coms and more.
5,This Is On The Show Itself,"While I don't know the show by season, I HAVE seen this series and let me say this set will be worth your cash! In my opinion, Queen Latifiah, Kim Coles, Erika Alexander, Kim Fields, John Henton and T.C. Carson created a show that is pretty timeless. If was ""Friends"" before FRIENDS but better in my view! It not only made you laugh but it made you think about things deeper than that.The only tragedy here is that it doesn't get the press that other black shows like Martin or The Cosby Show gets. Otherwise, there would be more than just this one season out. I hope one day they release all the seasons because otherwise you have to watch TVOne just to see the other episodes since they are starting to show on there.Back to this set, prepare to laugh and think all in one entertaining package!"
4,I love this show!,I have been a fan of this show for years! I just wish that the whole show was on DVD and not just the first season. It got funnier and funnier each year!
2,Very Displeased,"I got this item for myself because I am still a huge fan of this show. I had to return the item because it had a DVD from another show in it. I received a replacement and it also had another DVD from another show in it. I asked for a refund and I still have not gotten a refund. I would love to have the DVD collection, but it did not work out. I think it might have been a manufacturer's defect."
1,Living Single 1st Season,"I am a big watcher of Living Single, and have been waiting for the DVD to be released. Howevever, after reading the subject categories of the disc's, they do not seem to be in order. I'd like to see from the very beginning in order. I see nothing about Sinclare even moving in with the girls. Now it seems we'd have to float around from disc to disc to find the correct sequence of the storyline. Maybe they can redo it and put it all in order."
4,Sorry but 'only' 4 stars,"Surely, this is a good album. But because I should give 5 stars to some greater Italian album, this got only 4 stars. Io Sono and Darwin by Banco, Melos by Cervello, Concerto Grosso per 1(side 1) by New Trolls, Il Tempo della Gioia by QVL (yeah, great music!)...they deserve 5 stars easily. RDF is a excellent band but slightly weaker than these bands. I think generally early 70s band did better job than later 70s's band. And to give full 5 stars to Pulsar, I gave 4 stars to Atoll with feeling sorry(?). Same story."
3,"IF THIS IS A MASTERPIECE, THEN WHAT ABOUT OTHER 150 BETTER ALBUMS FROM THE ITALIAN PROGRESSIVE ROCK SCENE!?!?!","Just an OK album, nicely played by musicians who are capable to deliver a good album, just a good album, but say this is a masterpiece, well...It's too much, and exaggerated."
2,Overrated,"I think this album is just the most overrated of Italian Prog Rock. The melodies are awfully obvious and wxaggeratedly sweet. This is not progressive rock in the word's correct meaning, it's regressive, self-referential music. I think if most people say this is the best It-Prog album, they don't really know what good Italian Progressive is."
1,"The worst Italian prog ""Classic,"" worse than Maxophone","This album sounds like if John Tesh made an album and hired an Italian singer with raspy vocals. This is not progressive at all, it is worse than most elevator music. In fact this stuff insults good elevator music such as Frank Sinatra and Jobim. I bought this cd without listening to it...big mistake. A clue should have been the incredibly amateurish airbrush art on the cover of a fairy lying on the beach. What tripe! People who like this thing are the ones who give progressive music a bad name. Luckily I was able to exchange this with something else. But you might not be so fortunate."
4,A little less than excellent.... but highly recommendable.,"Well, perhaps I should have to grant it a plain full five stars.But... there's always some little nuances that keeps one from giving the highest rating.In this particular case is the vocalist. In my opinion Leonardo Sasso exceeds in the use of harsh tones and appears a little bit strong over a well balanced music ensemble. I don't want to mean that he is a bad singer. Not at all... but perhaps his voice or his vocal techniques aren't the best for the kind of music they compose. Pay good attention to the last (bonus) track called New York: backing vocals and choirs give it the soft quiet mood that some other songs lack.Nevertheless this album is an excellent work, a music masterpiece that by any means runs second to PFM, Banco, or any other italian prog rock talent. In fact, during instrumental passages, anyone can believe it is one of those great bands. Try it, you'll not be dissappointed at all."
5,A masterpiece.,"This brilliant Italian progressive outfit made this recording in 1977 and then disapeared for over twenty years. A pity, as this recording is a classic. It stands equally with the finest of PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Museo Rosenbach and other Italian progressive greats. The musicianship, compositions, vocals(in Italian) and production are all exceptional. Where there is a strong melodic sense throughout the arrangements are quite complex and rich. Not a weak cut in the entire 54 minutes of music. A must have for any prog fan, Italian or otherwise....Simon"
3,Interesting,I found this easy to listen to but not of much help to any pathway to purpose for me. It was interesting and did get some ideas from listening to it.
3,Put My Wife to Sleep and Drove Her to Drink,"Not really, but she opted not to finish it due to the word choice of the author. I go out of my way to buy books at Barnes & Noble so that she has an easier way to return them if she does not like a book I buy."
5,Pathway to Purpose,this book was just as it was advertised-very good condition. The shipping was even fast than expected. Thank you
5,This is a wonderful book!,"I not only enjoyed the practical tips and realistic action steps in this book, but I also loved reading the stories from the author's life and journey. It is SO clear that she has asked the same question that I ask and that she has felt the same feelings that I feel. Just like the Introduction says, I feel like she is a friend after reading this book. And I feel like I am more equipped to begin to discover and live out my life purpose for God."
2,"Love Ariosto, Hate the Kindle ed.","I bought the Kindle edition convinced that it was the same Oxford edition that it is advertised with. Well, it is not. It seems a very old translation, that would explain the cheap price, and is not easy to read to the modern reader. I would stick to the paperback version on this one..."
2,Not a bad start,"Great start to Coco's English singing career. Not as developed as ""Exposed"", but still a treat for serious fans.The best track is the Robin Thicke penned ""It's a Party""(the only original song on an album of remakes). A real standout is ""This Maquerade"". I would avoid even listening to ""Another sad love song"". Terrible beyond words. Overall a worth while purchase, if u can find it."
4,Sometimes I get a little lost in life... make sure others can find where you are!!!,"In the depths of an empty college life, there's one friend that I can always rely on - the Small Shofar Ram Horn. Ever since I turned 48 to start life in a dorm, the horn has always been there for me. Not to be emotional either, but I love it. Yes, Shofar, I love you.It has even made me some friends, because Shofar is a rallier of children, adults, and ostrich mounts! Quite typical for the intuition of a muffin missing its cork. Whenever the danger of the city lurks at night, and the college policias are nearby, I can blow my rally horn to fight the gangs of the city. Just like in Barney when the lost kid blows her whistle to arise fortestrial conflict and friendly fighting amongst the purple dinosaur and young children.So just think, next time you wish to fill the empty spot in your bag with something besides wordless college texts, buy a small Shofar Ram Horn IE a Shofar friend finder."
2,Very poor !,"Some bands of the 80's are still interesting to listen to, Judas Priest is not one of these. Sorry, but I'll give this one to somebody because for sure, I won't listen to it again until the rest of my life.The band sounds completely out dated and the musical structure is simple and boring. Get a couple cd's of Iron Maiden instead, they were and still are great musicians and their music is still actual."
4,Pretty Good!,"This is a very good compilation although i was i bit upset ""The Sentinel"" and ""Invader"" weren't on this album thats why i only gave it 4 stars! But i would highly recommed this to buy"
5,One of the best,"This is perhaps the best collection I've ever heard by a band. It would have been nice if they would have just ignored Turbo and Ram It Down, but I'll live. Most of the picks here are tough to argue with. Unfortunately, the legal problems they've had since 1976 don't allow them to use anything recorded on Sad Wings or Rocka Rolla. They did not omit these out of distaste, they just din't have a choice. Overall, a great introduction to an amazing band, that is worth every penny."
4,Wow good film for the small budget,When I got this movie I thought it has to be bad but i was surprised. I had heard that it was made for less then 1000. but wow what a well done film for the price. The Cole Brothers are so resourceful in this film. There are some very scary shots. and the lead actor (Stephen Twardokus) is very interesting to watch. for the budget this movie is good. It's worth to rent or even buy for 8 dollars.
4,The Mutilation Man DVD,Not bad for low budget indie slasher flick. Production value was pretty high considering the budget. Read some okay reviews about this film on various horror websites.
1,really bad!!,"I don't even know where to begin, the packaging is horrible you cant get the product out with it dripping into the lid, it doesn't spread well at all, its sticky and oily and clogs your razor.You don't get a close shave at all with this. It causes body acne because its so oily. And everything greased up so you cant hold onto your razor well. The cap also retains tons of shower water so next time you open it dirty cold OLD shower water cascades done. The only positive is the scent, it smells OK. Really bad stuff, this stuff doesn't work and was a few dollars MORE than regular shaving cream!"
1,No useful Information,"If you are looking for information such as useful scripts, creative prospecting ideas, this is not the book. There are no secrets revealed. I found nothing worthy of implementing because absolutely nothing was revealed. I'll save you the $2, the only useful suggestion was to treat your business as a business, get up, plan your work and work your plan as if you worked for a corporation and had to clock in.There aren't even any ""tips"" mentioned in the book. No practices to apply. This is just a narrative of how a small town girl made it big, but she never reveals any of her processes."
4,Merce Cunningham as Romeo,"Some dance lovers might be amused to know that the cover photo for the LP was originally chosen by Columbia with no knowledge of who was pictured, thus treating dance lovers to the delicious prospect of Merce Cunningham and Carolyn Brown as Romeo and Juliet without any understanding of how improbable that idea was. The run of the album had to be done all over again when it was pointed out to them that the photograph was of known figures. Previously they had been uncredited. I am assuming the CD gives proper credit. The performance by Mitropoulos, by the way, is excellent."
5,Medieval and Renaissance Polyphony,This album includes extracts from 11 albums of Huelgas Ensemble & Paul van Nevel.The albums are:Codex Las HuelgasFebus Avant!La Dissection d'un Homme arméAntoine BrumelItalia MiaNicolas GombertLas EnsaladasIn Morte di Madonna LauraPraetoriusJoao Lourenco Rebelo Vesper Psalms and LamentationsOrlando di Lasso Lagrime di San PietroHighly recommended!
4,"Pretty esoteric fare, but well done","There are no masterpieces here, and I can't imagine anyone rushing out to buy music set to the poems of Holderlin unless they were either very German or owned practicaly everything else written by Strauss and Brahms. Having said that, this is a good theme album for sophisticates, and Abbado and his singers do al you could ever want for the pieces chosen."
5,Great solid wrench for the money,"Compared to other adjustable wrenches near this price. This is one is hard to beat. The handle is a major point it's round and fits in the hand without the feel of the standard flat wrench, plus the rubber grip helps really apply torque"
5,Does the job,A really nice wrench compared to the simple forged all-metal ones. Very ergonomic and nice to hold. Also provides some extra grip in wet situations.
4,$21.70 for maxgrip,"Since I didn't own any tools, I didn't have to replace any with Stanley's maxgrip line. These tools are more comfortable in the hand like OXO good grips items."
4,Christmas fare for all year,"Christopher Winn's book, I Never Knew That About England, is a little classic. Yes, I, too, received it as a Christmas present but it's far too good to be confined to the festive season.It's one of those 'dip in and out' books that satisfies one's insatiable need for words when there isn't time to settle down to a long read. You can pick it up at any time, in passing. I have been known to do just that, stopping at the top of the stairs, where I'd last put it down, entirely forgetting that I had been in the process of making a cup of tea! It tickles the fancy with odds and ends of facts one could never have guessed at. It inspires you to go avisiting places you'd never thought of.I have only one caveat. We need another book to complement it. There just isn't enough in this one book.Patricia R Olds. Author."
4,When A Blind Man Cries,"This DVD has variating quality, due to the tape (recorded from the concert) used to create the DVD. This however is not a problem, because the important songs has very good quality (Child In Time). Most of the best songs are included. I especially like The song ""When A Blind Man Cries"", because Steve Morse really gets the guitar solo right. It will change your mood, that's how beautiful the solo is."
4,Transitional concert,"A good show. It was transitional - this was before their Purpendicular album was finished, and after the Battle Rages On tour. Some of the songs from the Battle tour were still being played : Battle Rages On, Anya, Child in Time, When a Blind Man Cries, etc. There is one song from the upcoming album - 'Purpendicular Waltz', but in a semi-complete form. So, it has elements of their prior tour, and elements of their forthcoming one. They don't play 'Child' or 'Anya' much anymore, so to hear those with Steve Morse is pretty cool."
2,Deep Purple getting very murky....,The Video Quality on this DVD is very poor....I believe it was not their intent to record this Program. The Sound is PCM Stereo...and the Technical Review here fails to mention it.You might as well have bought an Audio CD !!!! Dont touch it if you value your money
5,Excellent work as usual,"This is an excellent work from DP. Everybody is great, great , great. Steve Morse replaced Ritchie successfuly. I always enjoyed DP and they are the only band that I still listen to since 1984 (I was 18), especially these days when you cannot find ANY good hard rock around you. The only thing that was really really bad that ruined my joy, and it is not DP fault, was that the people from India who were doing the Video recording. They were the wosrt ever. They where showing the audiance when they should have shown Lord for example. They showed Glover when the supposed to show Morse and so on. More of the good work DP. Bravo"
3,good movi,"Deep Purple has always been a favourite band but when they re-grouped without Blackmore, I couldn't help wonder whether it would be the same. New kid Steve Morse was a pleasant surprise. While no-one can quite outshine Richie, Steve has an electrifying style of his own that has give new Deep Purple a different but altogether enjoyable sound."
2,Great DVD but mine's flawed,"This is a great story presented by John Hammond with great music. Just a pity my DVD had a flaw, so it doesn't play properly."
3,Pretty Good,"A nice review of Robert Johnson's life. I purchased it mainly because I saw Keith Richards name attached to it. Unfortunately, he and Eric Clapton appear for a few seconds at the beginning and never to be seen again. I was disappointed."
2,Not as good as others...,"This documentary was rather disappointing to me. Mr. Hammond is a fine musician but too much of the film is wasted showing him performing Johnson's music. It was interesting watching Hammond and Mr. Johnny Shines 'cuttin' heads' on the street corners of a delta town. However, Hammond isn't a good interviewer and it seems like he just uses this as a platform to showcase his own considerable talent. I would advise anyone to stay away from this one and get 'Can't you hear the wind howl' instead. This is basically a rehash of all the same material. If your a diehard like me, go ahead and watch it but you might be disappointed."
5,Saint of 9/11,A wonderful telling of the story of a man who gave his life to God and for the firefighters who he served and loved.
5,This is one of Miller's best!,"I have read Banner O'Brien several times and each time I enjoy it more than the last. Banner is spirited and an equal match for Adam! This book is the first of the Corbin series and I love them all! Some may object to the fact that Adam spanks Banner twice but it was not overdone and was even funny when he spanked her in front of his mother, who tried not to notice! I love all of the Corbin's and would love to see a book about Katherine and Daniel's story! Please Linda, don't let the Corbin series have ended!"
2,Writing by Rote,"Each time I begin reading a Lael-Miller novel I tell myself that its the last book by this author that I'll read. Yet, I am sometimes swayed by a particularly appealing story line outlined on the back cover. Banner O'Brien is no different. I did a lot of eye rolling throughout, from the first time the good doctor refers to the heroine as ""Shamrock"" (for the color of her eyes), to the stunted and unemotional ending. The main characters lacked a development that normally leads the reader to root for them. In fact, very early on they declared their love for one another. Boring! All the hero and heroine had in common was a somewhat delicious sex life and their choosen professions. The villians lacked development as well, and the end seemed to culminate in one page with a barely perceptible shrug. It seems as though this novel was written on auto pilot."
3,Lust will keep us together,"Linda Lael Miller fans frequently recommend BANNER O'BRIEN as one of the author's best books. I beg to disagree. Although high-strung, temperamental characters are mainstays of romance novels, the hero and heroine in BANNER O'BRIEN seemed entirely **too** high-strung and temperamental. **Both of them.** Mutual suspicion and mistrust kept Adam and Banner fighting with each other -- often physically -- from beginning to end. In fact, the only thing holding them together seemed to be lust: They'd fight, then they'd have sex, and then the whole cycle started over again. Perhaps I'm alone in this, but the heroine's constant accusations about the hero's suspected infidelity became tedious, bordering on distasteful.Minor characters were delightful, however, especially the hero's family."
4,Good weekend read,"Fun! It was a credible story line and would recommend it to people who want a nice weekend read, enjoy."
4,Another Heartwarming Story from Linda Lael Miller,"I always enjoy this author's books. The stories are not sappy but have a ""feel good"" quality about them.A perfect read for vacations. I buy all her books as soon as they come out."
1,Not my favorite LML,"I am fairly new to Linda Lael Miller and have really enjoyed her contemporary novels so I don't really know if they are the norm for her or if Banner O'Brien is more indicative of her style but I was very disappointed. I had to force myself to finish this book since I actually paid for it. The characters were not likeable. They were shallow, cold, and unfeeling not to mention not well-developed. I am officially on hiatus from LLM after reluctantly reading this book. Sorry, although I've enjoyed other LLM books, I definitely do not recommend this one."
5,Banner O'Brien,"I found this to be a Great read. Linda Lael Miller as away with her writting that sucks you in,and once your in you don't want to come back. I really enjoyed the little town and all the charactors. The Corbin boys are Sexy,Hard headed and strong willed and make a great story."
4,"good, not great","This was a fast book to read. Overall I liked it although I never really cared for Adam or Banner. Also, I know it's a romance novel, but falling in love in a day or a week. Please. I would have felt better even if details were omitted just knowing that weeks had past and that they at least got to know each other better. It seemed like Jeff spent more time with Banner and knew her better than Adam did. When Banner and Adam fell in love and got married, Adam wasn't yet convinced that Banner was a good doctor. I found that I was much more interested in Jeff throughout the book. The resolution of the mountain visits did surprise me though."
2,Disappointed by this LLM story.,This started out slow and trite and stayed that way. I never finished it. just didn't think it had any redeeming value.
3,Not one of Millers best.,I enjoyed this book and look forward to finding and reading some sequels to it. I have read many of linda's books and her vampire series had to have been her best. So if you read this book and want to give up on the author.. Don't.
3,Wasn't the best!,"I am a fan of Linda Leal Miller, have enjoyed a lot of her books, but this one I was having a hard time finishing it! Found my self skipping while I was reading just so I could say I finished the book. And had a really hard time with the name Banner, every mention of her name, I pictured a man! This book won't ruin me for other books written by her, it just wasn't my favorite!For me personally, I don't like it when the main characters fall in love in the first 3 chapters"
3,New Park Street Pulpit sermons,"I was expecting all 6 volumes to be in this book, but it is only the 1st volume. It seems deceptive not to put ""volume 1"" when that is all it is. I'm sure I will enjoy the portion I got, but it is much less than I expected for the price I paid."
1,THIS CD IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!,"OF ALL THE HYPE ABOUT COCO LEE, WELL LISTENING TO THIS TRASH FOR 5 MINUTES MADE ME SICK. I DOUBT SHE BECOMES ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY HERE IN THE STATES. SHE REALLY NEEDS TO GET OVER HERSELF.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
4,"Great product, but...","A great product and really a must-have for baby-proofing your home. These are definitely more expensive than conventional outlet plugs, but safer and much more convenient, especially for those outlets that get a lot of use.The only reason this is not a 5-star review is because the product does not come with screws and as other reviewers have pointed out, your typical outlet cover screws will probably be too short for this cover. I had to buy new screws to install these."
1,Doesn't fit,"I have standard outlets and there is no way to mount this on them. I guess I should have notice that this outlet cover mounts w/ two screws where as ours have only one. Instead of using this, now we have all new outlets that are tamper resistant."
5,"Strong and spare, like the desert","I was fortunate to hear Greg Martin give a reading from this book. Reading this book from end to end I heard the echo of his voice, the caring for his family, the strong feeling of place and anchoring he gets from Mountain City. Driving by, I have often wondered what it must be like to live in some of the small, lonely, almost-empty towns that aren't too hard to find in the West. I wonder where the people came from-and went to, and what happened, and this book gives me a glimpse into one such place. The smallness and sparseness aside, there's more history and depth than I would have thought driving by it. I'll look more carefully at other small places now."
4,A strong work about vanishing small town America,"When I read about the History of America, two aspects come to mind. And that is that America is made up of many different groups and many small towns. While the USA is perhaps more ethnically diverse then ever, small towns like Mountain City are disappearing from the landscape. I fear that one day we will all be living in cities, and then America will have lost something. Gregory Martin writes of his immigrant community with great affection and feeling. Many of the characters in his book are individuals who had lived in Mountain City when it was a relatively thriving town, and refused to leave when the town declined after the mines played out. It was somewhat chilling to imagine that in our lifetimes Mountain City may well cease to exist. The fact that I would be concerned about this is a testement to Martin's writing."
1,Angela's Ashes? Please!!At the risk of sounding,"At the risk of sounding cynical, I must beg to differ with those reviewers who were enchanted by Martin's rambling memoirs. After reading about half of this book, my main question was ""Who does this man know in the publishing industry to ever get such a work published?"" I found his ""style"" grating, disjointed, and simply boring at times. If I want to know more about the Basque settlers in Nevada, I'll look elsewhere for my information, thank you. Martin earns no accolades from this reviewer."
5,Shampoo,Used this supplier before. Very fast and dependable. Will use again in the future. Never a doubt that I'll get what I ordered. Nice to do business with.
1,Caspian light,I'm still waiting for this to arrive! I got an email it shipped on Feb 22 and will arrive by March 16!!! Really! 3 weeks??? It's March 9 now and still no light.
5,Super,I really liked the ideas for differentiating instruction in my classes. I have incorporated several of the ideas already. Great way to get out of a rut.
3,"Nice looking, but HUGE","Theses glasses look great, but are much bigger than I expected them to be. Just one set of 4 takes up most of the cabinet space. Definitely no way I could fit three sets in there! I would recommend seeing these in person before registering for them as I did."
4,Very Good but not the Best,"This is a very good book but it's real value today is for collectors. If you are serious about playing Battletech you need the Master Rules-Revised Edition. The Battletech Compenduim does not answer many questions plus it does not have new (COOL) weapons and equipment nor many rules explained in Master Rules. It is still a very good book but not for the hardcore ""Techers""."
2,I've seen better....much better.,"Clunky and slow gaming system meet unrealism--and yes, I know this is Science Fiction. If you have any background in military or science, be prepared to ignore physics. Plenty of support for the system out there, though."
3,A good book but,I would have prefered more technical information. If you are looking for a book to assist you in getting started working in porcelain there are better choices but it is a nice addition to an existing library.
5,this book inspires me,i love this book. i found it in a library one day and had to have it. it inspires me and has great visuals to help you improve your pottery technique.
2,student,"I give this book two stars because it was a nice attempt at a difficult topic but it fails in my opinion.The major falling of this book in this readers opinion: The absence of scientific explanation does not automatically prove that God exists.The author is a molecular biologist, not an expert on behavior. Yet claims are made about behavior that are not supported by data, or ideas are suggested which have been solidly refuted by good data.I went into this book very optimistically but left very disappointed. I did however enjoy some sharp insights the author made, such as a good education not only give one the facts but also teaches one how to argue against the facts.The book offers too many radial ideas, which are not supported and are very unlikely to be supported by data in the future.Overall read this book and decide for yourself. I thought it was in the bottom 25% of all books I have ever read."
1,Not How Pictured,"The wig was not as pictured. I washed with mild shampoo as the instructions suggested. The color was right, but the wig is frizzy, matted, and heavily tangled. I washed with mild shampoo as the instructions suggested and used a brush to try to fix it but that didn't work.For a few extra bucks you can get a wig that actually works.I would not purchase another wig from this company."
1,somthing wrong here,"I have ordered this twice from Amazons mp3 store and all I get is a zero byte folder, no music!As far as the music is concered it is magnificent, just remember this was recorded in Sam Marco Cathedral which has its own special acustics most importantly eing a time delay resulting in a stereo effect within the building itself.I have to pan this mp3 however because I am not getting what I paid for from Amazon"
5,Splendid Performance,"Even after listening to the preview clips, I wasn't sure whether buying this CD was a good idea; listening to it put all uncertainties to rest. This is a beautiful recording of some of Gabrieli's finest pieces. Listening to the music, you are able to hear the unique acoustics of San Marco - it's clear this was not recorded in a studio. The music doesn't sound distorted or warped: after the music has finished, you hear a faint but clear echo. The quality of the performance is stellar; it sounds as though this CD was recorded yesterday. Listening to music recorded in a studio is one thing; listening to music recorded in the place the composer intended it to be performed is something else."
5,All I expected,"While some reviewers noted its being a bit dated, I found the sound on a good system all I expected: Gabrieli on his own stage!"
5,An incredible recording,Years ago I purchased this on a vinal record and was taken away by its incredible sound.... In its present CD it is even better than I remember. Having visited St. Mark's Basilica and seeing the actual place where the music was written for and hearing one of the only recordings ever made there in that magnificent space still inspires me.This is a must for any one who enjoys renaissance polyphony.
5,Very comfortable grip,"Some of my tools were stolen and decided to replace the adjustable wrenches with the MaxGrip. The grip is rounded so when you really apply pressure it's much more comfortable than a standard adjustable wrench. The down side is they don't open up quite as far as a standard cresent wrench. But if you get the 8"", and 10"" you'll be happy. I really can't tell you how much more comforatable they are than a standard adjustable wrench. You'll need to try one out in a hardware store and I know you'll agree they are worth the price. I only wish they sold them in sets of three or four."
5,Arthur Goes to the Circus,"I read Arthur's Chicken Pox. In this book, Arthur gets the chicken pox. Arthur wakes up with red spots on his face. He gets to eat on the sofa and DW wants to eat on the sofa, too. Will Arthur ever get better...I think you should read this book."
5,Great Substitute,"My daughter lost her library book, so this was a replacement. I didn't know she'd lost a hardback book instead of a paperback. Oh well! The book was as described and will fit beautifully into the school library."
1,Don't Bother,"This video has about three minutes of ""Dog Baseball"" and the rest is a bunch of very lo-res mini films. Wegman tries to be witty and give a new take on everyday events and processes. His wit fails him, and the events are rather dull. If you like his popular works of dog photos, or films that don't make you sea sick, don't bother."
3,Good solid reference,"This book is a good solid reference for Analytical Technicians, content-wise. Some of the presentation is a bit retro, but the substance is good."
1,What you talkin' 'bout Willis?,"Despite partisan claims concerning war-mongering, the fact of the matter is that Weldon had one source, whom the C.I.A. had dealt with and deemed unreliable, and that Weldon has no experience debriefing sources, he is a politician not a C.I.A. case officer. This assault against the C.I.A., an agency that has done us much good despite its tarnished reputation, is merely a conspiracy theory penned by a man ignorant of the basic principles of responsible research. See the June 8th NY Times article titled ""Congressman's Book Calls C.I.A. Unfit"" for more information."
1,"No, Thank You !!! I'm Full","I find it pretty shameful that after all that ""evidences"" of WMD in Iraq and sham of US and UK intelligence agencies, some politicians still want to make a fool out of public, pushing their rubbish down people's throat; so, No thank you !!! I'm already full from Iraq.http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/attytood/archives/001988.htmlIranian VEVAK has already ridiculed West's intelligence agencies through the so called ""visionary"" politicians and their credible channels enough; let's just for once leave CIA do its job properly without Alis or Chalabis."
1,"This book is, ahem, bovine excrement","Readers beware: the content of this book, as well as its conclusions, is based almost entirely on material received from a discredited source. It is in other words, total bunk.(...)But by all means, please purchase it if you enjoy reading elaborate, manipulative fabrications from the same reprehensible folks that helped bring us Iran-Contra.Be forewarned, kiddies..."
3,Half the story?,"This book is on a very timely and vital topic of international relations for the United States. On the positive side it points up the importance of Iran which has been a covert adversary of the US over the last 20 years. The book presents a lot of interesting information about what is happing in Iran today. However, one does not get the whole history of US relations with Iraq since the downfall of the Shah--much of which is undoubtedly secret. Also, a central contention of the book is that the CIA is ignoring a vital source of information about Iran, but we never get the CIA counterpoint to this contention or at least something approximating their reasoning. As a reader I felt I had gained some insight, but was missing importance perspective on the subject as a whole."
1,frisbees,"that is all that really needs to be said about this product. if you want an abundant source of dvd frisbees, JVC is the obvious choice. it is amazing, i created 6 out of the first 10 i burned and i had plenty more to go. i hope you have as much fun flinging these things around as the wonderful AOL discs that come in through the mail every week. GO JVC for making reliable products!!!"
2,"Unfortunately, poor quality print...","This book is AWESOME. Unfortunately I received a poor quality copy. I am comparing it to a good quality print I have, and the difference is too loud to ignore. Much of the appeal for me was in the images and the grainy photos and excessive contrast take away a lot of the detail and charm. I ordered this copy for a friend's birthday and I feel it is not an adequate gift in the condition it arrived. ."
1,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this selection. The large size format was great, but I expecxted more floor plan types of diagrams. I also expected a little more of ""how to"" information. The last half of the book was filled with photos from the 1970's hippie days. If you are looking for a clear description of various kinds of living places, this isn't it."
5,you will read this book for 30 years,"I bought this book when I was fourteen years old and it blew my tiny little mind! Now that I've lived a bunch of years in the design field, and I take it off the shelf, tattered from three decades of intense study, it still blows my (now even tinier) mind. Mr. Kahn has done us all a great service with this book that goes beyond architecture to higher values and has a spirit that leads by example. Sure it's got some crazy hippy parts, do with that what you will. But a deep devotion to what you make and why; it's all here. I'm thankful for this inspiring work."
1,This is a PIG with a giraffe print material (or maybe a wild boar shape...but definitely not a giraffe),"My daughter saw this and wanted it-- she loves giraffes. However when we got it, we discovered it was distinctly shaped like a pig; there is NO LONG NECK--in this sitting position it looks cute but in no way does this resemble a giraffe. If you want a giraffe, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.I am very disappointed with this item!"
1,Very Disappointing,"With a name like ""Tales from the Patriots Sideline,"" one would imagine that the books would focus on the players, be they on field or off. Not here. Most of the book is about how pathetic and woeful the ownership was before Mr. Kraft bought it. Very little of the book actually deals with on-field episodes. I did like some of his chapters on specific players, but even then most of the discussion was not about playing, but about their battles and problems with management and coaches. Overall, the book bored me and I love the Patriots.As an aside, Don Brocher, who Felger says was the trainer during a John Hannah tirade, was actually the assistant equipment manager. The stupid, little, easily checkable mistakes make me wonder if the author just didn't do the book in a hurry to capitalize on the team's recent success."
1,Pure Fluff,"Do not waist your time buying this book. Even the most casual fan of the Patriots will know of or has heard every anecdote Felger draws upon. In fact, all the research needed for this book could have been extracted from the newspaper archieves from the Globe or Herald. No need to quote the likes of Pat Sullivan or Gino. Felger would have been better asking Art Donovan for old Colt stories and making them up as Pats stories. Rather than be cutting edge, by discussing problems such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, domestic violence or the real cut throat antics of professional football (something the Pats are famous for), Felger sold out to the team he covers daily. SAVE YOUR MONEY. And one final note; FIRE THE PROOF READER!!! I have never read a book with more typo's i.e., Den Dreith??"
3,Never Would Have Been Written,"Fifteen years ago, no one would have thought to write a book on the Patriots and their history. But the world of professional football has changed, and the team name is now synonymous with success. Felger's book provides a concise history of the few high points and many, many low points of the first four decades of the team's existence. It's no major tome, instead a primer for the franchise that has gone from patsies to kings."
3,Needed Larger,"Large was way too small for my hands. Inside of glove has white lining. I would of probably kept them if they fit, they seem warm."
2,"Not warm, not thick, don't know what's with the other reviewers!","I liked these at first. When I went out to the mailbox to get my mail they seemed plenty warm, only I really didn't like the fact that they give absolutely NO coverage of your wrist. I guess you could buy an arm or leg warmer to wear between the end of your shirt or jacket and the beginning of the glove, but that's more money and where would you get that?Then it got worse! Later I went out to the store, and they seemed fine at first to walk into the store (less than 1/4 of a block from the parking space. But on the way out the wind had picked up. It was 27 or 29 degrees with a seriously blowing wind. Even walking less than a quarter of a block (30 yards?) my hands started getting cold and my fingers significantly cold. My fingers would likely get frost bitten in these if I had to spend 30 minutes out in the cold with a strongly blowing wind! I will be returning these!"
4,Good Heavy Glove,"Good glove for keeping your hands warm. However, the insulation makes the glove a bit stiff. Good quality, but I would not consider this a driving glove."
4,Solid gloves but they are tight.,"Well made and very soft, but they are cut narrow (not short). I think they will stretch out in time. If you have thin hands with long fingers they should fit perfect."
3,Eh.,These gloves are stiff at first and take a bit of working in. I expect that from work gloves by Carhartt but not driving gloves. Order large. The insulation is excessive and unnecessary. Again - driving gloves. I suggest Carhartt stick to true working products. Leather smells like all sickly nasty black crap from China.
3,Oh Ok!,Recommended to die hard skid row fans.Do yourself a favour though a getSkid Row Road Kill instead (A Classic)!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,"bought it, fast shipping ill give you that, only reason for 1 star.. bolted on, doesn't really fit right, made me wind up almost doing a burnout, put the car in D, foot on BRAKE STILL, didn't realize the foot pedal was that wide, my foot was on both the brake and the gas, all i did was move off the brake and the car started peeling out :P 5 minutes later i unbolted it and threw it right in the garbage, cute idea but don't waste your $$$"
2,misleading: this is not a video!,"I recently got this DVD from a friend and she bought it in the belief that it was a concert VIDEO of Nikolaus Harnoncourt leading the Berlin Philharmonic in Strauss waltzes. This DVD is SOUND ONLY, but it will not play in your regular CD player, you must use a DVD player. The additional menu options that are navigated on screen are sparse and hardly worth the effort. This music is available on CD also, a much better deal! As for the music: Harnoncourt is not my favourite conductor, but I admire him for some of his work on baroque and early classical music. Strauss is definitely not his medium. While he is known for his quick pace in the baroque interpretations, he is pretty slow-footed on some of the waltzes and polkas. This makes them loose some of the lightness and typical viennese air, and that is regrettable. He does pick some pieces from the Strauss repertoire that are not heard so often, and in that regard this work is interesting."
2,Wrong size,The listing said they would fit my truck however they are too small even though the application said they would fit. I noticed another review on here for the same problem so apparently they haven't fixed it yet. They look nice in the package but I'm disappointed that they haven't resolved this issue.
2,"Filters ok, but flimsy design","As far as I can tell, this filters the air to the specifications they list on the package. The problem I have is that they bend and ultimately get sucked down into the lower ductwork. For some reason, the cardboard frame on these filters just gives out. I have to use a coat hanger each time to hook and pull it back out. I've used many other brands and none have had this problem on this furnace."
5,Gourmet taste without the difficult instructions,My husband actually found this on the bargain bin! Little did we know it would be the best cookbook we own. Everything i have cooked has been scrumptious. I recommend the jalepeno enchildas and asian stuffed shrooms.My husband said he wouldn't mind being vegetarian if all the food tasted this good.
4,A real thriller,"This DVD tells the son's story. It provides a contrast with other book and dvd versions. I have long been fascinated by the events of that night, after reading a very early version."
4,Shows everyone else how it's done,"Buddha's back! After Buddha Bar V (which in my opinion was a offering that failed to match the stratospherically high standards set by the series) DJ Ravin (BB III) is back at the helm and knocking out a seriously impressive selection of typically BB themes. Starting out with a funky rendition based a Delibes classical piece, CD1 continues to increase the expectation up to the highlight of CD1 for me: Por-Do-Sol by Cellar 55.CD2 starts very mellow, so much so that I initially thought that the Ravin was breaking with the tradition of CD1 being more mellow and CD2 being more upbeat. However, the pace picks up throughout the second CD up the my favourite, Manvatara by Bliss.All in all, a quality outing by the masters of asian-influenced lounge. Thank you Ravin!"
2,I have them all- take heed and be careful before you buy it!,"Well well, how surprised I was to see the large praise for this uninspiring compilation! I should have known before listening it would be dodgy when I read the name of the 1st CD, ""ReBirth"" and then there is ""ReJoice"" as the second CD. The first gets a HUGE fat ZERO in my book - YUK- BORING- PRETENTIOUS - TOTALLY UNINSPIRING. The second is not actually not too bad, but sounds a wee bit laboured if you are in the wrong mood. Altogether OK I suppose to put on at dinner with a ""safe"" audience, but the genre can do much better- try ""Chill Out in Paris 3"" by David Visan : Altogether much more challenging and satisfying stuff!"
2,Siddharta vs. Buddha-Bar,"Ravin used to guarantee good quality and a ""new"" journey on each release. He is obviously putting his selecting method on random. If you check out Siddharta 1 & 2 you will find many of the same acts and especially artists signed to Music For Dreams. Does Ravin own shares in that company? To me it's too much of the same thing and I always expect to be introduced to something new and exciting, not the latest tracks from a few producers. Get your act together Ravin or you will kill the Buddha-Bar series forever!"
3,"Departure from the Asian, Eastern music influnce","Is the departure from the asian, eastern music influnce in this album a new direction or an exception for the Buddha Bar music series? Although there are a few great tracks on this album, I gave it 3 stars because it fell below my expectations set by the Buddha Bar IV, III and to a lesser extent V. I would rate these as 5,5 and 4 respectively. I would strongly recommend you add these 3 albums to your collection prior to considering Buddha Bar VI."
5,amazed by the mixed reviews,"I am totally blown away by the fact that this album only gets 3.5 stars. I own all the Buddha Bar CD's up to 6 and love them all, but this one is by far my favorite. I play this whenever we have a party or a few dinner guests, and without fail, people ask me for the name of this CD. It's not as middle eastern sounding as some of the others. It's more of a European groove, but the tracks are very sensual and draw you into almost a chill out state of mind. Out of all the Buddha Bar CD""s this is the set I play the most. After this, Buddha Bar II is my next favorite."
3,Desappointing,"I have the other CDs of Buddha Bar that I loved completely so when number VI was released, I jumped on it... I was pretty desappointed. There is no diversity in the music, same rythm all the time... very different from the other CDs.Not for you if you like diverse style music."
5,MARVELOUS MOZART,"The Mozart sonatas for violin and piano are glorious works, and this premiere SONY collection spans the widest emotional and lyrical breadth in the hands of artists Stern and Bronfman. There is such an unmatched, contagious sensitivity and joy apparent in the collaboration of this duo that the disc is entirely self-recommending. Especially memorable are the tender and contemplative slow movements, juxtaposed so brilliantly by Mozart's jaunty allegros. The sound, as well, is completely natural and intimate, the musicians appearing as if in person.[Running time: 62:28]"
3,Not what I thought,"It was hard to believe that these were facial cloths. They looked more like pot holders.......even including the end loop to hang them. They were thick, not easy to manage with an infant. Cute pattern but not practical for using with an infant."
2,His heart's just not in it.,"If you listen to the RealAudio previews, it sounds as though he's singing karaoke to his own songs. It's not due to the lower fidelity. On the CD, his voice sounds tired. The vocals and instrumentation are off a few beats in places. This compilation was very poorly produced.Cabrel recorded some of the same songs in Spanish in the early 80's and they were great. Unfortunately, these aren't the same recordings. My 15 year search for the album ""Todo Aquello Que Escribi"" continues..."
2,Too Small,"Stanley products are generally well made. The reason I chose this wrench is because my hands are small and I thought it would be easier to handle. But this one is way to small. The 8"" would have been a better choice."
3,Product not the same color as in the picture,"The bottle is solid green, and it's a darker green than what is pictured, much darker. I thought the bottle would look like the picture and have different shades of green, but it's just one color. I sent it back."
3,Beautiful!,"After less than a year of use, the top came unglued. It's not something you can fix. I'm going to buy another one because this is so pretty."
1,RASTAFARI AN CURSING???,"First of all there is no such thing as Rastafarian cursing!!! Rastafarians are a peaceful loving cult who participate in praising Jah Rastafari (God) our king Haile Selassie. We do burn fiyah and brimstone with judgement upon bad and negative things. We do not curse, we praise. Now there may be such a thing as Jamaican patois cursing, but no such thing as Rasta curses. Fiyah pon dis book!!!"
1,Not Good,Rastafarian cursing!!! You must mean Jamaican patois cursing! I and I are the most righteous loving people on the earth. Rasta does not curse other human beings! I and I give thanks and praise to The Most High Jah Rastafari!! I agree with Ras Carlyle!! Burn Fiyah pon dis book!!!
1,Rasta is cuss?!,"Well i was haphazardly schemin the web and i see a book of rasta cuss words?i know many rastafarians and they would frown on this book,they would never curse another human being.Fiyah pon dis book!"
3,Pretty good. . .almost,"Not a bad product. . .once you figure out that you have to check the arial view after every little change you make to ensure you haven't crashed the system. I got most of a home built, then forgetting my own advice, made several changes without checking. Well, sure enough, now the place looks like an earthquake hit -- all the furniture is floating and out of place and the system has a glitch, so I can't put it back. Not a user friendly program, but if you have computer experience you should be able to figure it out."
5,This disc rocks!,"This is a disc for both fans of the band and those who have only heard hits like ""Fly"" and ""Every Morning."" Longtome fans will delight in the inclusion of older, harder tracks like ""Mean Machine,"" ""Caboose,"" and ""Iron Mic."" These tracks will also show those who have only heard the more recent stuff just how cool and verstile this band is. The 5.1 sound is amazing and it even included the video for ""Falls Apart"" which was not on the VHS."
5,For The Fans,"The Tracks:CabooseMean Machine10 Seconds DownIron MicFly (feat. Super Cat)RPMEvery MorningSomeday-And intervies with band members and their families about the band.Aspect ratio: 1.33:1Audio: Dolby AC-3 5.1, LPCM (CD Quality uncompressed pro-logic compatible 2.0)My opinion is that the 5.1 mix does not make extensive use of the rear channels, but helps to provide a crisper sound environment than pro-logic 1 or 2.Bonus Track: Falls Apart (Also LPCM and 5.1)"
5,My Heart Belongs to Arnaud's,"During my last visit to New Orleans my new bride and I became engaged at Arnaud's over a meal that celebrated our happiness. We use Arnaud's Cookbook to make our special occasion meals and when we entertain. The Trout Meuniere and other amazing recipes bring back those memories along with the lavishly photographed restaurant and dishes. The stories and history that accompany it make it special reading, and we keep it prominently displayed on our coffee table. When most cookbooks don't show the finished dish, this one is chock full of delicious pictures to inspire. It you have never been to New Orleans, it will give you a taste and a real feeling of an amazing city."

5,Good product after 5 years of use,"I bought these vents for my 2003 F150 Supercrew pickup about 5 years ago and they've held up very well and work great. There are only two draw backs I see with them, one is the possibility of leaks around the window seals once they are removed after long use since they spread the seal out around the window a little bit. The second draw back is when the back windows are rolled down the vents sometimes slip out of the seal a little bit and vibrate in the wind, but they haven't fallen out yet. I don't know if the window seals will leak when the vents are removed, but I don't plan on removing them any time soon, so I guess it doesn't matter that much. I use to owned the gule on versions on my 1993 Mustang until the wind and weather finally wore down the adhesive after a few years. In my experiance I would recommend this type over the gule type since there is no gule backing to where out."
1,Credit Where It's Due,"I haven't seen this book, but I assume that the script it contains for ""Chinatown"" conforms to the final cut of the film as released. If so, just be aware that the film wasn't really written by Robert Towne. Towne's screenplay was COMPLETELY redone by Roman Polanski, over Towne's very strong objections. Polanski, to his credit, has been pretty quiet about the subject. Towne, to his shame, has also. He continues to receive and accept credit for a script he never wrote. It's much more Polanski's movie than Towne's.I'd love to see someone do an article on what went on between these two guys between the time Towne turned in his final draft and Polanski finished cutting the film. That would be much more instructive."
5,Nothing But Gackt,"As anyone can tell, or for those who need lots of help and need to read Gackt's auto-biography, he is neither bi nor was he with Dir en Grey. The band was Malice Mizer. Rebirth, going back to the splendour of this album, is ""most definitely"" one of Gackt's better albums. The only song that I haven't listened to much is Marmalade. But what ever Gackt does, whether it's doing the para para, fan-servicing through Vanilla during concerts (not a gay thing to do at all), or singing covers of John Lennon, it's all good in the hood for him. Along with Rebirth, however, if you haven't picked up ""The Sixth Day ~Single Collection~"", get it my friend."
5,Gackt's most impressive work to date,"Gackt's third album is quite different from both the mini-album 'Mizerable' and its follow-up, 'Mars'. It's darker, more introspective and incredibly beautiful, carefully crafted to pull the listener along on a journey of the heart. The album as a whole had a far greater impact on me than any one song alone-- and 'Kimi no Tame ni Dekiru Koto' is the perfect ending to this amazing odyssey. The songs are lush, melodic and wildly different, ranging from dark and self-aware to wistful, to defiantly optimistic. 'Uncontrol', especially, made me want to turn the volume up as far as possible and just sing along (and it has the most fascinating instrumentals; rather like an auto factory underwater.) Gackt has a gorgeous voice that just doesn't quit, and it serves him well in this album once again, along with his unusually poetic lyrics and imaginative music. If you're new to Gackt, or even Japanese rock in general, you can't go wrong with this CD."
5,... have no words to describe it...,I have no words to describe it. That's all. It's completely amazing! One of the songs that has caught me was Sayonara. A precious ballad...
5,pretty much the word i live by.,"I am a spiritual (not religious) person. Not really feeling comfortable at first with the heavy use of God in this book, I eventually came to hear the wisdom coming through. Interesting coincidence, since I became upon the book at my grandmothers house after she passed. This purchase was a gift for a friend. Highly suggest this book to those looking for positive change in their life. Reading it all the way through is suggested, but even here and there tidbits will give you something to think on, at the very least. Whenever I'm feeling down about something, I read a few pages at random and I instantly shift into a greater mindset. Feeling at peace once owning up to the responsibility you have for YOUR self, YOUR emotions, YOUR actions, you come to find your life the beautiful reality that ""You Are Always Your Own Experience""."
4,Things I liked about the book,"I thought this book ""Dances With Wolves"" was a great book. It cought my attention quickly watching the movie. I would prefer the movie over the book because I like movies better. Although The book has much more details."
4,Good education product,I like this product. It's durable and has many great features. I like that you can write in the book with a dry erase marker. The word choices for each letter of the alphabet is definitely age appropriate.
4,a greatest hits,"Although the artists were unknown to me, this is a truly a greatest hits collection of gospel in the older (30's to 50's) style. It represents choral, solo and small group work, some of the latter backed by a Hammond B3 organ. The quality of the recordings are good but the passion and excitement of the singers is truly outstanding.For the novice, I would strongly recommend this collection."
1,All hype,"After seeing the Ojon products several times on TV, I finally decided to purchase this kit with the shampoo, conditioner and restorative hair treatment as well as the volume foam. I could not wait to try them. I gave the products week of steady use, and found that everything dried my air out. I have naturally wavy hair that I color. It tends to be dry, but not overly dry. The foam was very similar to one another ""natural"" product salon line. I used it sparingly; only one to one and a half pumps and it made my hair feel dry. I found nothing at all conditioning about this foam. It was ok, but it is not worth the price. The ""Ojon"" oil is just American Palm oil (Elaeis Oleifera) which is widely used in many food and beauty products. It is way too expensive for the poor results. I have read many reviews and see that a lot of people seem to like it, but I think it is all hype. I do not recommend, save your money!"
4,Good Crib,"I, too, fell in love with this crib when I was first pregnant. I also liked that there was no drop down front. I still like that fact. It's difficult at times to lay the baby down with the matress all the way lowered, but it's do-able. I am not tall, only 5'4"". The one thing I do not like about this crib is that there is no plastic guard on the rails, like the traditional cribs, for teething babies. Our baby just started chewing on anything and everything. There is nothing you can buy to fit the rounded rails, either. I think the company should come up with plastic railings we can either buy or that come with the crib."
4,"Great price, very sturdy, good quality, no complaints!","Other reviews of this bed state you cannot put a mobile on the bed. You can! We have a Tiny Love mobile that's worked fine. However, the paint does chip with it or with teething. My crib skirt doesn't fit great but who really cares? It's very sturdy, very pretty. We are ready to convert it now and we'll see how that goes. I would recommend this crib and would buy it again."
3,Nothing unusual,Its a decent book which more or less reflects what Jack Welch and the other Corporate Strategy guru's have often spoken.
3,OK but not good quality,"After buying the Harbor Freight plug cutters which are horrible, I decided to spend the bucks and get a good set. I'm still lokking for a good set. The taper cutters are OK but the straight ones tear out the wood pretty badly."
2,Disappointing,"I had come to expect a higher standard from Misty. This book wasn't up to it. First off, the entire plot of the book changed from Eric's return to Julliard to some random problem with the Underworld. Then characters kept dropping in and out, points of view kept shifting around, and too many questions were left unanswered. There were some good points to this book, but they didn't even out with the bad points. Over all, this book was basically a waste of time. If you want to read it, either check it out from the library or wait till it comes out in paperback."
2,Wait for the paperback,"There's not enough substance in this book to justify paying $20. Book takes a while to get up steam, ends quickly with the set-up for the next book."
1,Disappointing Edition,"I wrote the last review, giving this book high marks. That was the previous edition, however. I ordered the current edition, published in 2002, and am disappointed. The guide lists only physicians in large metropolitan areas. In Arizona, for instance, only physicians in the Phoenix area are listed, and in Washington, only those doctors in Seattle are listed. So if you live in a smaller county or are unable to travel to a large city, this book will not be helpful.Also, one of the neurosurgeons listed in the Seattle area has now lost his license due to Medicare fraud!"
2,Unreliable and overrated health resource!,"I bought this book eagerly hoping that it would take the trouble out of finding the right top doctor. I got a name of one dr i went to who had 3 votes on it, and found his office to be sub-standard, let alone, top. Then I figured I'd look at dr's who I've gone to, who I would NEVER recommend to a pet, let alone a person, only to find them listed in this book, and I found two of them. I don't know how they come up with the ratings, but I would place very little stock on the ratings given in this book, and would treat it as a hit or miss thing. Trust your gut feeling when u first meet a dr. and go from there."
1,PAID reviews.,"Unfortunately Checkbooks reviews are problematic: Checkbook magazine is a local (they have regional editions) consumer magazine that I picked up looking for advice on optimoligists. They had a raving review of a north end practice (Highland), so I made an appt, as it happened I passed this information on to a couple of other people, and they also made appts. We all had horrible experiences. With a little research it turns out you have to be a paying member to review or give input about what ever they are reviewing - this makes any reccomendations they have meaningless - only those with a financial interest in the reviews are likely to pay to make them. It seems this magazine actually potentially provides a disservice to those who read it ."
5,A Stone Cold Stunner,"This box set is filled with over six hours of Stone Cold Highlights, with all 6 of his home videos. Goes through all of Austin's career and highlights his feud's with several of the WWF Superstars, including Bret Hart, Kane, The Undertaker, The Rock, and federation owner Vince McMahon"
5,Buy this book even if you have a small health problem,"If you have skin problems, allergies, ADD, Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, or any other health problem or 'syndrome,' buy this book and visit Sue Dengate's Food Intolerance Network web site.Most of our health problems seem to be caused by the foods we eat. You might be allergic to something you eat every day and don't even know it. Simplify your diet, at least for a while, and see if it makes a difference in your health in ways you never thought possible. It might even raise your I.Q. a little. Who knows? Try it and find out."
4,Good Overview of the Failsafe Diet and Recipes,"This is a very good book that does a great job of explaining what the Failsafe diet is, what the author's and others experiences have been with this diet and has a lot of recipes, menu ideas, shopping lists and a lot of other useful information. My son is very sensitive to many foods and chemicals that is why I have been looking in to this diet, it does a great job of trying to simplify such a complex topic and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in trying this diet!"
1,Remastering Botch job in Haydn Variations,"Warning...The Haydn Variations omits a repeat in the Theme that is present in the ""Essential Classics"" version. This version runs 17:02 and the EC versions runs 17:30. Download that version if you want the whole thing!"
2,I found Magic Fire a bit of a let down,I had been waiting for Magic Fire for ages but when i came out i was very disapointed. It started off well but it started to get very confusing and i thought the end was abrupt but it did have some weird but good twists in and it had a very original storyline!
3,a bit of a disapointment....,"Pike has to be my favorite author but his latest book is just not up to scratch. It's still an interesting read, and might leave you wondering, but the end just seems to wrap up to quickly and is some what of an anticlimax... Don't take my word for it. Read it for yourself, but you might want to wait till it comes to your library."
3,When too much originality is a bad thing...,"I started reading this book and thought it was one of the best Chirstopher Pike books around. I never read about a pryromaniac before and thought it was an interesting topic. Then around page 100, the story starts to take a nose-dive from which is only barely recovers from. The alien plot in the book seemed to unrealistic for this book and the story isn't all that plausible to begin with. Still, no one has a track record like Mr. Pike. This is the only book of his that I haven't liked. And when is he coming out with a new book? I hope ""The Grave"" isn't his last book..."
5,Give it a chance,"Well all I can say is that it is a shame that so many seem to deem this book not worthy. This story was so fantastic. It may have gotten a little complex at some moments, but it kept me wondering what was the real truth. When I read this, I couldn't put it down. For some particular reviewers I find it a disappointment to hear them judge this book in such a cruel manner, and then attack some of the reviewers for enjoying this book. I feel that as a Pike reader you have to expected both the expected and the unexpected. But if you really wanted to read two books that are so unlike Mr. Pike's but still as beautiful and as meanful as the next try reading The Midnight Club or Sati. And I think that Mr. PIke does a great job at intertwining many themes into his stories. So if there is one thing I can say, this book is another job well done for Pike!"
5,amazing,I read this book quite some time ago and my mind was baffled! I normally wouldn't read books written for young adults but Pike is always an exception for me. This book just blew me away. I envy the abilty he has to capture so much in so little space. Reda it...it's a real trip. :)
4,This Book had a strange ending,"When I first started reading this Magic Fire. I thought it wasahorror story about a pyromaniac, but after I read the first 100pages. I found out it was more like a sci-fi book. You may be wondering why the book is called Magic Fire, the reason being is that Mark Cahrm(the pyromaniac) can control fires with his mind. This book has a weird twist at the end. You are going to have to read the book to find out what the ending is. thereason I gave it a 4 was because of the vulgar material in it's contents."
2,Hmm...Matrix anyone...?,"I have a suggestion...you choose the one that best applies to you. Number 1, if you have seen the movie called the Matrix, DON'T read this book. And Number 2, if you have read this book, DON'T waste your time watching The Matrix. I cannot believe this...the basic concept of this book spawned from the movie The Matrix. I'm not anywhere near finishing (halfway), and I just don't think I'll pick the book back up. It's turning out to be good, but c'mon......Pike, you could do better."
4,Pike is a master,"I hope that Mr. Pike gives us more adult fiction soon. I am eagerly awaiting the Cold One's sequel and for a while was afraid he had dropped off the face of the earth. Luckily I found his most recent release The Grave and am reassured that he is still amoung the living --or at least someone using his name is alive. I love reading the spirituality aspects and must totally disagree with the person who gave this book 0 stars. If Mr Pike is reading this please write more deep and less surface horror books. You are definately going in the right direction not the wrong one. Another reader has mentioned this but I, too have been a Pike fan since I was about 12 or 13 and can say that I think I have read every book in this genre that he has written (this of course excludes the one's for real little kids--although I did read one of those and it was pretty good although a bit too young for my 19 years.) Keep up the good work, Mr. Pike."
2,Very Confusing,"I don't know if its just me, but i didn't understand much of this book. I don't see how aliens, fire, MAZE, and advanced space stations connect. The story starts out with a teen who enjoys burning things to vent his feelings, but then it turns into aliens taking over the planet and space stations and killing all the people on the planet (?). I'm 13, and I didn't see any connection. The plot was confusing, and many aspects were left unexplained. What was with the MAZE at the end and that Mexican clinic and Mark's sister? What's with killing all of the people on the planet? The whole brains floating in tanks? It just wasn't a very clear book compared to Christopher Pike's other novels."
4,"A lot of twists in this story, interesting idea","The main problem with this story was that it didn't seem to know what it wanted to be about. But if you like surprises and twists and turns, this is the book for you. Think of it as Wild Things in print. At first I thought it would be more like one of Christopher Pike's other novels, The Wicked Heart. On the back, they play up the whole idea of Mark being a pyromaniac, but that is only a small portion of what this book is about. .This does not stop this book from being entertaining though, although it dragged in parts. The ending is totally unexpected, you are barely given a clue, but that does not stop it from being a good ending, and it does make sense. This book, like the grave has strong science fiction overtones. The characters are maybe not as interesting as Shari, Julia or Roxanne and Pepper, but they are still far above most young adult characters. I would give it maybe three and a half stars, but I can't bring myself to give it just three."
3,A great read -- but pay attention,"Pike often mixes the themes of sci-fi and horror. 'Magic Fire' is not what you would expect by reading the back cover. The story progresses rapdily a few chapters into the book and takes on a very strong sci-fi twist. It does, at times, feel like the caracter development has suffered because of this. But at the same time, the elements of horror and suspense that Pike is famous for are still there and as effective as ever. 'Magic Fire' isn't one of his best books, but still a great read nonetheless. The ending will really get you thinking!"
4,GREAT and not so great,It's really good in some parts... but in others... it's not so good. I think it's worth buying if you're a big fan. 1 1/2 thumbs up!
3,Kinda does what it says,Takes a couple days for it make a big difference. Seemed to lower nitrates. Didnt change the ph very much.
5,Bilsteins on -a -budget,Great deal on these bad boys-replaced the worn out fronts on my 77 GMC Motorhome & what a difference. Rated on the web a tad under Bilsteins but with a lifetime warranty & less than half the price you can't go wrong!!!!
3,iJoy Ottoman 2.0 Review,It is mainly a soft calves massager. Foot massaging is not very effective. Its cradle like design is very useful.
3,yes good but on the other hand...,"I've used this before, and am getting more, have had fish for YEARS. Someone went on and on about people needing things so fish must need things... using distilled water,etc. HUH? Unless you have discus or something this info is rediculous! Tap water needs conditioning for fish, or let the water sit several days for chlorines to dissipate.Personally,I use much of the water from my pond where the fish spend their summers, but I also keep conditioners and other products on hand. This one works as well as more expensive ones. But enough with the distilled water and coffeepots for pete's sake!"
1,Killed my fish!,"I'm not entirely sure what happened or what I did wrong with this product...I used it the exact same way in three nearly identical tanks, and got three completely different results. The first tank it actually did what it said on the tin, the second it did NOTHING, and in the third, it clouded over and killed my fish!I'm still relatively new to fishkeeping, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't my doing (or at least, certainly not ALL my doing). Be extremely careful when using this product. I'm not even sure that proper aeration (or the lack thereof) is what caused the problem, as each tank had pretty much the same amount of airflow and breathing room at the top."
3,From a Survival point of view...,"The overall movie itself was very interesting and kept me on edge waiting to see who was going to survive and how they were going to get themselves out of the hell-hole they were in.Throughout the situation, and the entire movie, many small survival tips and strategies were highlighted and used. Things such as energy and resource management came in to play as did group dynamics and personality clashes.Without ruining the end of the movie, I felt that the method in which they self-rescued was a little far-fetched and completely blue all of the truths about the survival techniques and strategies they used out of the water. All-in-all a good movie to watch, with some interesting survival tips to take note off, but definitely not the ending I was expecting."
3,A pretty little mop. Could be better.,"Mop worked well until the mop head separated from the plastic base after the third use. I guess that's why they sell a replacement head. That being said, it works and is not real spendy."
3,Sop Mop Outset QB77,It is a good quality mop but the mop head itself is longer than I expected. Not made for burgers or brats.
4,Best pack I have ever owned,"This pack is the best pack I have ever owned. It is very well built....far better than Targus or Swiss.I travel on 4 planes per week and have gone through many packs, until I got this one.Mobile Edge makes great products. I beg that you come out with a pack that can fit the Lenovo W700ds."
3,"informative, but...","The most astonishing thing about this book was the number of typos it contained. Seriously, there were 100's, if not 1000's of typos. They made this dry, portly tome even more difficult to read."
1,A clear manipulation of Amazon's review system,"Note how many five star, extremely short, anonymous reviews this book got on 14 September! [NB: these reviews have since been removed, but given the topic, what does the original attempt to beat Amazon's system say about the book?]"
3,Ol' Skool,I bought this CD awhile ago for one particular track because of the slammin' beat (track#8) and gave me memories of listening to ''kool DJ Red Alert'' back in the days. This comp has some alright tracks and cool tracks that'll bring some way back memories. All Dance hall hip hop. Stuff that u won't listen as often on the radio nowadays. Only if it's on a mix show.
5,Wonderful Filter!,Arrived in perfect condition! Didn't think I'd be able to find a lens for this old camera.
5,Fishing with Dick in the Northwest,"There are lots of fishing guides but few about fishing in the salt water of the Pacific Northwest. He writes good naturedly about tactics and lures most attractive to the Northwestern fish. He all modes of saltwater fishing, mooching, jigging and trolling. It is both the most complete guide as well as the shortest and most detailed book available on the subject. This book is a real ""catch""whether you are relocating or lived here forever and think you have ""heard it all""! pelican on Whidbey Island, an avid fisherman."
5,powerful!,"This is an excellent collection of spirituals, arranged in an interesting combination of the traditional and the new. Elijah Rock is wonderful, and Swing Low, Sweet Chariot will bring tears to your eyes. I particularly liked the men's voices - beautiful harmonies and exact rhythm on all tracks. This is a fantastic CD!"
4,Cute but be cautious!,"I recently purchased this growth chart to match the rest of the barnyard theme I've got going on in my baby's new room. While its adorable beyond belief, we realized you hang it kind of like a picture frame with two clasps up at the top to hang on wall tacks or nails. It is a little bit heavy because it is wood and acrylic so make sure to put another screw at the bottom to anchor it a little bit better to the wall. It hangs about 2 feet above the floor so we could just see our little girl pulling on it and having the thing falling and hitting her. Other than that fact I'd be giving it 5 stars because its such a cute idea and matches very well with the rest of Kids Line Inc. Barnyard accessories."
1,Didn't work...,I bought this item and had to return it because it did not work for my Casio keyboard. I have a Casiotone CT-607. I think I'm going to be using batteries forever. xkx
5,excellent work great,received on time. price is great and it work fine. no issues after several months of use. resurrected my old keyboard to life
2,Doesn't fit!,"I ordered this adapter since the one that came with the CTK-2300 didn't work (as many of the reviews I read had mentioned). I originally ordered an additional adapter to be sure that if the one that comes in the box with the keyboard didn't work, then I was prepared with my back-up adapter. I ordered the one the was at the bottom of the page that read,""customers who ordered this product also ordered..."" so that was my fault for not reading the specifics of the item and when I got it, it wasn't the correct size. So I jumped back on Amazon and found this model which said it was for the CTK models...Once again, it didn't fit!!Although it says it fits the CTK models for Casio, it didn't fit the CTK-2300 model. I am so fed up with the whole ""adapter"" issues that I am packing up the entire order and sending it back. I'll try ordering the Yamaha product and see if my luck is any better."
4,Got a different adapter than what is pictured but it works...,"The adapter does work, and it was a good price however I am a tad bit disappointed that the adapter I got was different from what is pictured, it is still a world tour product but it is a square super chunky and reeeaaallly heavy adapter, i dont remember my other keyboard adapter being this heavy.Otherwise for anyone that wants a cheap alternative to the Casio brand, this one seems to work fine (I have used it for like 2 days), but you may get an adapter that is different from what is pictured..."
1,Get Out,"There are sometimes where a artist is so overexposed, the feeling of the music isn't really appealing. That has been indefinitely the case with Kelly Clarkson. SInce her days with American Idol, she has been really too much of a good thing. It seems to me that her music isn't as appealing, and the feeling of the songs just doesn't click. That has shown with her single Walk Away, the fourth single from her 2004 album Breakaway. I honestly feel the appeal just doesn't seem to deliver. She honestly doesn't really deliver a convincing appeal as a driven singer, as the case with others who have delivered like Whitney Houston in song. This song like Kelly, should just go away.Song: F+"
3,save big $$$$$$$$$$$,I loved this tin I got all of the tins even the 2002 ones (...)it comes with a card and aa tin I use thwe tin to sort out my pokemon cards to get ready to sell them I HATE pokemon but thats y they invented a much beter game YU-Gi_oh
4,Behind The New Yu-Gi-Oh Tins: An in-depth coverage,"I enjoy the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, so when the new tins were advertised I patiently waited until I had sufficient funds to purchase one. The tins (as usual) come with 5 booster packs: 1 each of Dark Beggining 1, Dark Revelation Volume 1, Soul of the Duelist, Rise of Destiny, & Flaming Eternity. The tins also come with 1 Limited edition monster: 1 out of these 6; Gilford the Lightning, Rocket Warrior, Panther Warrior, Dark Magician Girl, Exarion Universe, or Vorse Raider, all useful cards. This is a good product to buy if you just want some more cards for your collection. If you are searching for a certain card, it may be a better idea to trade with your friends, as buying many packs in search for 1 rare card can get expensive. This is a good value, since 5 packs of cards would cost $20.00. The tin also doubles as a stylish card holder."
1,worst R&B female group ever,"No talent. Who gave them another record deal after this album and actually let them remake ""am I dreaming""? Absolutely terrible. Not trying to hate but it's pretty bad. Save your money."
5,Amazing,"Hummin' Comin' at' cha is one of the best albums of the 90's. All four of these singers have a voice,and what a strong voice! On tracks like ""Understanding"" and ""Tonight"" their vocals shine. Now nine years later when I listen to this album it remindes me of the good old days. I dont think Xscape could ever make another album like this one."
3,Average,"Average album, some good songs, two or three not-so-good songs. Their singing is unremarkable but did get better on their subsequent albums. Overall this album hasn't aged well and sounds very 1993, but I still listen to it once in awhile."
4,A fine study of a disappearing craft,"I first encountered this book on my first trip to the Grenadines in the early eighties when local boatbuilding was still practiced in the harbor at Bequia. Times are changing, even in the islands and though the building of local work boats still goes on, its heyday has passed. Although it has been a generation since it was written, it's good to see an old friend back in print. It is a fine tribute to local human ingenuity and creativity."
2,LED Ring Light,"This item is available in grocery checkout lanes for $1.99....the item itself is ok, but I suspect this is some unscrupulous person jacking the price up....I question whether or not it would even be delivered after payment is submitted."
3,A good first try.,"But unfortunately, there's nothing new in this book. The plot and characters are predictable and stereotypical. HOWEVER, the good news is that Amy Thomas published novels after ""Virtual Girl"" - so check out her other excellent works titled ""The Color of Distance"" and ""Through Alien Eyes""."
3,YA Fantasy Fairytale About a Cheese Maker and His Dog,"Remember the beginning of ""The Hobbit"" when Tolkien spends 50 pages describing the shire with tons of intricate slice of life details? The whole book is like that. It's a story about a cheese maker and his overweight dog who undertake a river boat journey with the express purpose of selling the yearly village goods and returning with honeycakes for the winter holiday. They encounter various fantasy tropes, but the whole narrative is laid back, lazy, and would appeal to younger children. Sometimes silly.A good book for bedtime story time, but not that great if you are an adult reader who wants another dose of fantasy. Went too slow for my personal taste -- I guess I'm too used to faster urban fantasy pacing."
3,A cheesy fantasy,"I've been anxious to try Blaylock's work for a while, but this was the only book of his that I found among three bookstores. While not a bad book by any means, it's not terribly good either. It plods. Several sentences jumped out as clunkers. As an adventure story, in fact, I'd rate this pretty low. But, though briefly at first it comes across like a cheap Tolkien knock-off, I consider more of a kind of fantasy character piece than an adventure. There are some interesting moments in the book, almost worthwhile to read the book for. (I really liked the bits about cheese making.) But it was, simply put, a book that failed to keep me wanting to read it. In fact, several times, I put it down to read other books."
3,Mediocre bag,This is not a great bag: the inner fabric ripped during the first dozen light uses. The shoulder strap is useless because the metal holders broke!Outer fabric is holding strong still.I would not purchase it again.
1,The DVD not the movie,"I just got a copy of this movie, ""limited collector's edition"" and it is a worse-than-VHS scrunched transfer on a DVD with no label whatsoever. Very disappointing. It was not the ""remastered"" version as displayed on this page. I don't want to get burned again. Anyone see the Red Sun version or know who's selling a good U.S. version of this?"
4,Super Bloody Venom Mob Moivie,This is one of my Favorite Kung Fu movies. Philip Kwok does an awesome Trident Kung Fu Form of which I have won tournaments doing. Because I took parts of his movies and incorporated into my form its great!. But this movie is bloody. Very bloody and not suitable for younger audiences. Its action packed. Good sword play but very little hand to hand combat as written in another post. What I highly suggest is that you get this movie but the REMASTERED Version. Or you will waist you money. The DVD cover is mostly Red. Check it out its one of their Best.CE
2,Audio,Movie audio continued to change throughout the movie. Going from English dubbing to it's original recorded track. This made the movie very irritating to watch.
4,Masked killers and tridents,"I have to say this Venoms flick ranks near the top on my favorites list. The story is great, with a band of martial artists tracking down a group of masked killers, with twists and turns and plenty of kung fu action. It only has 3 of the 5 Venoms, but still delivers the goods. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the picture quality was not all that great, it looks like it was dubbed from an old vhs copy, and the sound is garbled in some spots. Regardless I am still happy that I purchased it for I hadn't seen it for quite some time, and would recommed it to all Venoms fans."
3,The Venoms...so what!,"The title of this movie should really be: Look at my shiny stick! This flick is a murder mystery! Just because the venoms were in it didn't make it any better. There were no spectacular martial arts battles just guys running around in masks stabbing people with shiny sticks! The only good things you could say about this is that: 1)It has plenty of blood, 2)Samples of this movie were used for a rap album called ""The Pillage"" by an artist named Cappadonna of the Wu-Tang Clan.,and 3)There is no love story! Its better to rent before you buy! This movie is just another example of false hope. Just because a certain actor or a group of actors are in a movie doesn't change the fact that the movie will suck regardless!"
3,Good but not great,"I've known some of the basic stories in Greek mythology but obvioulsy nothing that goes to such depths as this novel does. I enjoyed it to a point, but at some parts I got a little bored. Some parts seemed a little repetitive, like the constant love affairs Zeus committed that poor Hermes had to clean up after.I'll be a little generous and give it 3 1/2 stars since it taught me so much more than I knew about Greek mythology. It definitely was a fascinating story, just not up to par with the plot I was expecting. Still interested on reading more on the subject and from this author if more is published."
5,A Book that was hard to put down!!!!,"I had borrowed the cd of this story,from my church.But I could not find the book at the library. So I checked Amozon.com,and found it.I thoroughly enjoyed reading God Knows My Size!! I almost cried a few times! It's a book that is hard to put down!!!"
5,Powerful Testimony - Great Book for Pre-teen and Teen Girls,"I read this inspiring book to my 11 year old daughter and she and I both looked forward to it every day. Silvia's life story is exciting and well-told.It was also a good education on many levels - the extreme poverty and repression in communist Romania, the faith in need and faith under persecution, as well as the search to know God's will in your life - real human stuff.Despite the cover, most of the book takes place while Silvia is a young adult.I highly recommmend this book for all."
2,"If you want to waste your time, read this book.","This book explains things as if you were retarded. It takes pages to explain the simplest things. I find myself reading pages of pages of basically nonesense. My reaction is just get to the point. I'm probably exaggerating, but I feel that 80 percent of this book is just constant repetition of things that have been already mentioned previously in the book. If I was the author of this book, I would have not ended this review until I have reached three pages of repeating what I said previously and in different ways using examples, analogies, etc...I have read better C++ books, which get to the point. Which are direct, clear, and concise."
1,Keep it next to your toilet,"Mandarin Chinese would be easier to decipher if you were blind-folded and sitting in a pitch-black cave. Like I mentioned in my title, keep it next to your toilet."
5,Feeling the spirit,"This is probably the most solid gospel compilation I've found. The selection is smart, elegant and historically significant over a span of decades. But best of all, you can feel the spirit move.From solo acts to choirs, I don't think there's a cut here that doesn't hold it's own and then some. I appreciate the chronological arrangement especially as it gives context to social commentary, esp Staple Singers' 'Why' and (my all-time favorite group) GGJS' 'Stalin...'.I've listened to this record for 15 years--it always has something new to offer. I didn't even realize it had been reissued on CD. Now that's something to sing about!"
4,Interestingly delicious,"Since I usually eat the cracklin style which have more air in them, these skins are a nice change. They are very crunchy most of the time and others have a softer, oilier taste. If you have some good choppers these are the ones you want to try."
1,fried pork skins,"Have not recieved the product for me to rate!!! I don't think I'll order again, i have purchase in past without any problems but not this timeLinda"
1,Poor Representation and Does Not Function,"After installation I found that both my doors contact the mirrors inflicking damage to both the mirrors and the doors. The mirrors were now my door stops. I went for a ride, the driver's side mirror vibrated to the point it was not viewable. The passenger's side was TOTALLY invisable because of the windshield post!!!This product is JUNK. Even if I was going to use my Jeep doorless all the time, only one mirror is useable and it shakes!NOTE: CROWN AUTOMOTIVE was excellent to deal with, they did not make this product and reimbursted me with 100% satisfaction!"
5,Great TV viewing,1997 was the year the Red Green show really took off. More characters were added and the show just overall had that big stage feel to it. In the series they have released 1991-1993 but I am still waiting on 1994-1996 to be released along with any season beyond 2001. If anyone knows the future of these seasons let me know.
3,red green show 1997 ok if you like comedy stints,I bought this season for my husband since he wanted it for quite a few years and I was able to find it on amazon. He thinks it is hilarious as he watched it growing up and found it enjoyable then. I thought it was ok; didnt really understand why you would do such things as are shown on the tv show.
3,Meeting Time Uncle Red!,"The New Red Green Show has been around now for 15 year. And like all good shows it is coming to an end this year. This DVD set is the 7th season. Possum Lodge is alive and well. Each episode is still entertaining. To me the show has lost some of it's strength. As Steve Smith explains in his Bios as The Red Green Show increased in popularity they were able to move to a building with more space and money to produce the show. But, they cut the number of characters down for each show. Seasons 4 to 6 is still the best of The Red Green Show. Although they were never released as a single season set. But, in one collection titled ""Stuffed and Mounted"" which covered the earlier works of the Red Green Show."
2,Missing parts,"TWO STARS BECAUSE OF THE VHS COPY----NOT THE STORY!!!I recorded the Little Kidnappers off of the Disney Channel some years ago and love it! Recently I was given a VHS copy of it and while watching it noticed some (important) scenes were missing. Now why would that be??? This would not be caught by anyone that was watching it for the first time but I have watched it so much I have it about memorized. It seems my copy will be the best one as there is still no US DVD or complete VHS to my knowledge. SO, beware when purchasing---some scenes are not present.THE MOVIE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES! A definate MUST TO OWN but you'd better RECORD it to get the entire story. :)"
4,A decent and entertaining film for the whole family.,"I am always looking for films that are decent. This film fits in that catagory. The boys steal away your heart. Brave, strong, and with delightful personalities. From beginning to end you will be intrigued with the boys ability to survive. The other actors are top notch. They keep the film interesting. I am going to add this to my collection of decent and entertaining films."
4,"Great Bach, but not the best.","Of course Glenn Gould has always been known for his Bach playing abilities. And if you buy this DVD you won't be dissapointed. His playing is superb. Technique is fantastic and his interpretation of the piece is first rate. It's always entertaining to watch because of how freaky old Glenn looks at the piano so low on his chair and his always disturbing ""other hand conducting"" thing he does. Anyway, the DVD picture quality is pretty good considering it was filmed almost 20 years ago. Sound is excellent. The only reason i thought this only deserved four stars: 1. A large attraction of DVD's are the extras. i would say this one has little to none. 2. Murray Perahia's recent recording of the work (available on cd) is preffered by me and most people. Murray is just as able as Glenn and his performance is authentic only his playing is much more charmingand he adds so many beautiful ornamentations on the second repeats. But this is worth the money to add to you collection."
4,NOT the same soundtrack as the CD!,"Although I HEARTILY recommend this DVD, I thought I'd give a heads-up pointing out that the soundtrack on this DVD is NOT the exact same one as Gould's CD of his second generation of Goldberg recordings. The digital CD recording was made simultaneously with a video-taping, but for whatever reasons, the soundtrack of the video/DVD is NOT of the same quality of the CD's digital soundtrack -- the CD being quite superior as far as background noise (aside from Gould's humming of course!) and wow and flutter -- both of which are much more noticeable on the video/DVD. In fact, some of the variations are slightly different ""takes"" than the CD! I suspected this and it became pretty obvious when I started the CD with the DVD only to find out that by the end of the end of the first Aria things were outta' sync by more than a little!Anyway, if you DO buy this DVD (and again, I DO recommend it!) be sure you don't overlook the superior sound quality of the CD also! -- Roy"
5,this video changed my life,"It inspired me to play the piano again. Very moving. A master interpreting the work of a master. Seeing this video for the first time (and every other time) is ""an experience"". I have 7 different Gould videos and plan on getting more, but if you want just one to start with, I would recommend this one."
5,simply amazing,"...frankly, I never appreciated G. Gould until I saw this. You will never see anyone play like this again. Forget his eccentricities, forget the oddness of watching him perform in a recording studio, etc. Just witness the depth of the man's involvement in this music, and his extraordinary technique. Oh, yes, and don't forget to pick your jaw up off the floor when you are done."
5,DVD info,"Amazon webpage has numerous errors about this DVD. I tried to correct it without success so far.This DVD is for ALL REGIONS (Region 0), not Region 2. It is in PAL, not NTSC. So most DVD/Blu-ray players can play it. My 7-year-old Bose, which is Region-1 locked, plays this DVD perfectly.As for Gould's Goldberg Variations, it is divine."
5,Szabo masters the Stratocaster,"Let me confess at the outset that I am a Gabor Szabo fan. There are a few of his later recordings that I do not appreciate as greatly as his earlier work, but this rare recording of him with studio musicians for Sweden, playing an electric Fender Stratocaster, rather than his usual Martin acoustic, is valuable if only to see how Szabo approached the electric guitar. Szabo occupies a strange position in the history of both jazz and pop guitarists. In many ways I regard him as the first sort of post modern jazz guitarist, a fusion guitarist, who was experimental in integrating modal scales from european folk music with popular western songs and sophisticated, yet minimalist arrangements. Always interesting, his work on electric guitar, while not as strong as his previous work with an acoustic axe, is nonetheless noteworthy for its experimental perambulations. I would not say this is the piece to introduce anyone to Szabo, but for fans, it really is a must have."
2,Height adjustment is non existant,"Only one height position, top of the stand. The height option is non existant, there is a tension screw adjustment that is so rigid that it is impossible to set and use the monitor at lower height levels. The tilt is also set with a tension screw that will allow for different settings if the tension setting is fully decreased."
4,Really good product,"It doesn't give you that much low angle, besides that the base is perfect, easy to put together, materials are really good, be careful with the monitor AOC f22s it will give you a hard time when you are changing the orientation of the monitor from landscape to portrait."
5,Good looking and functional,"A very nice product for the money. I bought this to mount my 23"" Acer in portrait mode and had it operational in just a few minutes. It's sturdy, well designed, and better looking than the Acer stand that came with the display."
5,Universal Stand,"I was given a flat screen TV without a pedestal stand. I checked with the TV manufacturer and they do not sell pedestals alone for my particular model. I could not find a universal TV stand unless I wanted a wall mounted version which I did not. And I did not want to put a ton of money into a stand. This stand worked perfectly for my 19"" TV. The TV has a DVD player so it's on the heavier side...approx. 23 lbs. This stand can handle it without issue. It's adjustable and easy to put together. Do not hesitate to use this for more than a computer screen."
3,Beautiful But Flawed,"The stand is very well made but functionally deficient because it has no method of locking the screen height once it is adjusted and the spring system that governs the height is too stong (even on the lowest setting) for the 15"" LCD TV that I am using it with. Perhaps if your display is bigger and heavier there would be sufficient adjustment to allow it to be balanced but beware about the lack of height lock."
2,I was disappointed,"I purchased this stand before purchasing my monitor, and it sat in the box for a couple of weeks. When the perfect 23-inch monitor finally arrived, I discovered the stand wouldn't work properly with it. I could pivot, but as soon as I removed my hand, the monitor became lopsided. As far as height adjustment, I could find no way to lock it in place. As soon as I touch the monitor, it falls down to the bottom of the stand. After fiddling with it for a while, I removed this stand and went back to the one that came with the monitor, which has no height adjustment, tilt or pivot. At some point, I will purchase a 22-inch monitor and try it again, but without being able to lock it to the correct height, I can't see it as being very practical."
5,Very impressed...,I thought this was going to be a piece of junk based on the pictures but I had a 20 inch monitor mounted on the wall and lost the stand. It's not easy to find a replacement stand for monitors but I was really impressed with this one. It's very well built and heavy duty too!
5,Absolutely perfect for my application,"I was looking for a new stand to hold my Acer X233H at work. I wanted something that could be raised and lowered and had a pretty good radius for spinning. As an extra bonus, the Neo Flex mount also rotates the screen for portrait views, though I don't honestly know if I'll ever use it.The assembly took 2 minutes and Philips head screwdriver.Thumbs up."
4,Great item for the Price,"I needed a replacement stand for an LCD monitor, and theNeoflex LCD Stand fit the bill exactly. I am using it with a 17-inch View Sonic monitor that had been previously wall-mounted. It fits any standard VESA mount with the provided screws and washers, and it has a small footprint, so it doesn't take up too much room on your desk.The stand adjusts vertically and tilts up and down. In addition, you can swivel the monitor either portrait or landscape. You can adjust the tension on all of the vertical adjustment with a provided hex wrench. Finally, the main neck has a hole at the bottom to feed your cabling through. For my purpose, the folks at Neoflex thought of everything. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a standard LCD stand to avoid buying a new monitor."
5,Wife is happy,"This was to mount her 24"" Samsung LCD for her new office desk set.The unit tilts and moves up and down with little effort and yet stays where you put it. It was easy to mount the monitor and works as intended.A happy wife make for a happy me!"
1,Disappointed,"The stand is fine for everything except mounting my Samsung 23"" monitor in the vertical position, which unfortunately is the reason I bought the stand. The mounting holes on the back of the Samsung are not in the center, so the weight of the monitor causes the monitor to rotate on the swivel as there is no locking mechanism to hold the monitor upright. Otherwise, I like the stand."
5,Really GREAT stand,"I needed a stand to adjust my extra monitor into a vertical (portrait) position. I was a little concerned about the price of this one but I looked at most of the stands Amazon sells and this one had the best reviews. I have to agree with what other people have said. This stand is really well-built. It can adjust to almost any position and comes with the screws needed to attach it to a standard LCD screen. The best thing about it is how easy it is to alter to different positions. When a monitor is attached, it can be tilted up and down or rotated from landscape to portrait. The height can be adjusted and the base rotates left and right as well. Right from the beginning, you can tell it was built to be a quality product."
5,Excellent for my use of it,"I've got two LCD's monitors that I like to work with at the same time, a 19"" and a 23"" Widescreen, and bought two of these so I could really adjust my desktop to my needs and liking, and I can tell you it's been great. I can adjust my monitors height and position easily, and this has had a great impact on my productivity since I can sit for many more hours, So I really recommend this product. As for Amazon, great as it always has been on all of my purchases."
5,an excellent value,"I bought a Dell 24"" (E248WFP) that didn't have an adjustable stand. It was very uncomfortable to view unless I set it on 2 reams of office paper to bring it closer to eye level. I decided to try the Neo-Flex and rid my desk of the ""office paper stand"" and I must say it worked perfectly. Very sturdy and only took 5 minutes to setup, this stand is great."
5,Monitor stand with acrobatic capability,This monitor stand works great. You can easily switch between portrait mode and landscape mode with fine adjustment for friction. And it's pretty. Very nice.
3,"great, but","My daughter had the multi-media system for two weeks when it started to act weird. The pages would not turn with the pen and the images were fading in and out. I changed batteries several times and that was not the problem She loves the toy, but she gets frustrated because of the problems with it. I have to try to get a replacement."
5,great!,package arrived timely and was as expected. we had a bunch of games from a friend for this machine. i was thankful to be able to find a working machine!
4,3.5 year old twins LOVE it,"I bought two of these for my twins, who are 3.5 years old, on clearance at toys r us for $20/each! I have had a hard time finding additional video ROMs for it in the stores but plenty are on line for minimum $15. Regardless of the fact that my twins do not comprehend ALL of the toys capability they have already learned the basic actions to get certain activities or games going which in turn has helped them learn some basic computer skills. Good news it it has a head phone jack for the easily annoyed and it does had two levels of volume, which are set at a reasonable level. My one complaint is that some systems come with chargers but the PIXTER does NOT."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my daughter's sixth birthday. They reel you in with the game selections, however, the games are ridiculous. You can't really do anything other than draw on the screen. The icons are confusing. I would not recommend this item to anybody. Don't even THINK about trying the digital camera you can buy as an accessory for $40. The pictures are terribly unclear and fuzzy. I say put your money into a Gameboy or Leap pad. This is a terribly outdated toy and not worth $5.00."
2,HAD IT 2 DAYS AND IT STOPPED WORKING,WE GOT THIS FOR OUR FIVE YEAR OLD THIS CHRISTMAS. IT IS DEAD. CHRISTMAS DAY WAS THE 25TH; TODAY IS THE 27TH. NO LONGER WORKING..... THAT WAS A GREAT USE OF 100.00 NOW WASNT IT.....
5,Lots of Fun,"While listening to this CD, I couldn't help but remember when I listened to Ray Steven singing these songs. It always made me laugh and was one of the first records I played for my children. This made me laugh again and will share with my grandchildren"
5,Excellent,Really enjoyed this CD and because I was not able to find it anywhere you had it and I was able to purchase it. I just love it and thank you for the speedy delivery and look forward to purchasing from you again in the future. Thanks again!! katrina
3,high points and low points,"I think Cledus had his heart in the right place when making this album, but the song selection is questionable. I mean how do you top Ray's versions of Gitarzan and the Streak? They are the gold standards, and any ""tribute"" sounds like amateur night at the Karaoke Club.On the other hand, Ray's arrangement of ""Misty"" gets a nice update from Vince Gill and a female artist. I would have preferred Vince go it alone, but it's still a good performance.""Everything Is Beautiful"" gets a ""We Are The World""-type various artist treatment, but not being a current country music buff, the only singer I can easily identify is Wynonna. The names are listed for the singers, but in no particular order. Still, it's a nice idea, and the song holds up well.Frankly, I would have preferred a few less novelty covers, and more ""Mr. Businessman"" and ""Nashville.""I doubt Ray will ever get the credit that he's due, but I give kudos to Cledus for at least making the effort."
3,A world music compilation with natural echo,"Essentially, this compilation asks the listener to imagine the spaces in which these performances were recorded, because there is no way one could know otherwise. So, it's a leap of faith, but one which has its rewards: the opening anonymous vocal is an evocative call, and Bach's famous organ cantata sounds luxurious, and many of the tracks are excellent performances well-recorded. Celestial Harmonies - always a quality label - needs to rerelease this as a Super Audio cd for audiophiles to drown in."
1,ACDelco GF652 Fuel Filter Not a Happy customer,"I am not happy with the purchase of ACDelco GF652 Fuel Filter. It took a while to get here and the packaging was not very neat, tears in the box. There wasn't any instructions included and was difficult to figure out how to connect. It's still not working."
5,Perfect OEM replacement match for 2000 Suburban,I ordered this filter for my 2000 suburban 1500 and it arrived promptly with Amazon prime. It was a extremely simple to install and the filter was an exact copy of what came with the Suburban.
5,Hey Nonnie Nonnie,I adore this soundtrack. The overture is incredibly stirring. Many other pieces are incredibly romantic. Listening to it makes me feel like I'm in the sunny Italian countryside--quite a feat for someone who lives in rainy Oregon.
3,a touch too much of something,"Well, I love the play but the music seems a touch too ... something. The theme song, ""Sigh no more"" gets interesting use in the movie - three times. But it is a puzzle either way either place. Patrick Doyle makes this interesting but one hearing was enough for me."
5,Sigh no more....,Patrick Doyle is definitely one of the best soundtrack composers ever. He uses rich chords and orchestration in all of his compositions and well worth listening to OVER and OVER. I would recommend all of his works! He is AWESOME!!!
5,Spirited and brisk,"Patrick Doyle, composer of Sense and Sensibility and Great Expectations, both of which I love, writes the music to Much Ado About Nothing beautifully, and it is a pleasure to listen to the mostly orchestral CD."
1,Disappointed,"At first this tool worked like magic, I enjoyed the length of the charge & the grass cutting power. Nice to get around borders! Maybe after 5 uses the cutting blades went pretty dull & won't cut anything. Very disappointed, because at first the product worked so well. Wouldn't waste your money - what a shame!"
5,Extension handle problems,"The Grass shear is excellent, but I would have liked to use the extension handle. I was never able to insert the grass shear into the handle, American Gardener advised me to start bending things. After two different handles that didn't work, I gave up. Has anyone got other advise?"
5,Best Yard Tool I Purchased,"I have been lookng for a coordless grass clipper and after reading various reviews, settled on this one. It's actually the lowest cost one I have looked at.The cutting power is stronger than I thought it would be, and the battery really does hold its charge just as advertised. I have used it several times for 30-45 minutes at a stretch and even as it goes weak, it still cuts fine. The safety interlock is a bit of a pain (you can't just squeeze the trigger) but I know why it's there.I am extremely happy with this product and highly recommend it."
3,"Works well, battery life only complaint.","This is the second time I have purchased these shears. It's really only a one season product in my experience. The battery last about two lawn edging times and then must be recharged. After a season the battery wouldn't hold a charge. However, it does work well and does do a good job of edging your lawn. The blades are very sharp and it even edges tough grass when fully charged. I feel it's worth buying, even with the battery disappointment, based on the reasonable price."
4,Get It,"This shear works well for what it is made to do: cut grass. It does it easily and cleanly, and it is pretty easy to hold the power button on. I've used some trimmers that were so tiring on the hands and fingers, you were limited by that and not the battery life. Now speaking of batteries, I think the unit does well. I don't think it's quite the stated 40 minutes but it comes close. Anyway I've yet to see a battery powered device that lasts as long as the manufacturer's claim. I think it's a worthwhile purchase given that it does perform well and its price is very reasonable."
5,American Gardener 4-Inch 4.8-Volt Cordless Grass Shear,"Before I bought this product, I compared it to the orange Black & Decker which I almost purchased. After reading the reviews on the latter, I decided to go with the American Gardener mainly because of the 4-inch wide blade in comparison. I have used it twice and absolutely love it so far. It would be nicer if the battery charge lasted more than about 40/45 minutes, but even that is good. I highly recommend this product for anyone."
1,american gardner cordless shear,This product doesn't last long at all.. I purchased one 2 years ago. The battery doesn't hold charge long and the clippers don't move even though blades are free from gunk. Stay away
4,high quality; gets job done; poor battery life,"if you are just cutting/edging grass, these blades should last a long time. it's not strong enough to do too much trimming of bushes, etc. the battery does not last more than about 10-15 minutes max during continuous use. people who are reporting one hour of use must be using it very intermittently. you may need more than one unit if you want to get your job done at one time. if it weren't for the short battery life, this would be a 5 star product."
5,Handy Little Helper,These shears are great! Lighweight and gets the job done. Stays charged for a long time.
3,Edging might be a problem,"I intended to purchase this product for both jobs: trimming and edging on the small/detail areas. But when I hold the shear and face it down trying to edge, I found the inconvenience.I dont see a problem for trimming, so I still keep it for this job.Another thing annoys me is the battery charger. It makes loud noise."
4,Great little trimmer,"I have used other hand held trimmers and I think that this one is tops.The only thing that held me back from full five stars is the battery. After full charge it works great, I have around a 5-10 min. section that I need to used it and after I do that and need to use it again it seems to have lost a great deal of battery."
4,Pleased with product,"Previously had a Black & Decker and a Homelite (7.2volt). Couldn't find replacement blades for Homelite or a model without the extendsion, so decided to try this American Gardener GS48. With intermittent use, lasted about 45 minutes or so. Blades were sharp, though have sharpened them myself. Was concerned about the power but while it strained in cutting thick clumps of grass it was able to do the job. t Noticed that the bottom of the unit tended to get a little warm after being used for a period of time.Bought an extra set of blades but couldn't buy another unit."
5,Unbelievable,These shears are the best you can buy. The price is right and the rechargeable battey lasts and lasts. The blades cut thru very tough weeds and/or grass. I bought two they work so good. You can't go wrong with these shears!!
3,Blade & its housing are a problem,"This is quieter and lighter than the Black & Decker and it lasts longer on a single charge, but the blade wears out faster and the housing for the blade can easily be knocked out of kilter rendering it useless. I sent it back to mfg who fixed it but then the battery started going and it stopped working altogether. It worked well for the short time I had it but it became more trouble than it's worth. The Black & Decker is really not any better. These companies need to build a better grass shear!"
5,Grass Shears,Once charged the unit performed very well and blew my Black and Decker unit out of the water. I did 2 lawns before noticing a slight power decrease. My first impression is it's a great device but will reserve my overall opinion as I use the unit over a period of time.
5,Love this product,"Just charge it up and snip away!!! Works great, blades are very sharp!!! Definitely recommend you buy this product. Very happy with it!!!"
3,Gardening Review,Good product but wish it comes with longer battery life in the initial package. Manage to use only for 45 min thou.Able to trim normal grass but not up to some hard shroud and roots.But still a good buy and definitely look forward to other accessories that are currently available.
4,Corless Grass Shear,"Very reliable, cuts all types of grass effortlessly and the battery life is great. Easy operation and lite to hold. I'd purchase it again!"
1,lousy shearers,"my husband purchased these garden shears for me for my birthday. he had read so many awesome reviews on how they did such a great job trimming and the charge on them lasted for so long a time. NOT...... the first time they were used wasn't too bad but after that, i was lucky to be able to use them for maybe 10 minutes, if i was lucky, then they died on me. neither one of us was pleased with the results. still looking for a better choice out there."
2,Cordless trimmer,Please do not waste your money on this item. Has little to no power and the battery only lasts a few minutes. My wife got so frustrated with this clipper that she threw it in the trash.
5,"Townhouse (Apartment, Condo) Grass",This product is perfect for my 25 square foot patch of grass in my backyard of my townhouse. It makes cutting the grass quick and easy. I was surprised at the lightness and smallness of the device but that does not sacrifice its power.Pro's:SmallLightGood Batter LifeSharp Cuts WellCuts my 25 Square Feet in about 2 minutesCon'sNone so farI really like this product and would recommend it for any small patches of grass or small trimming that needs to be done where a mower can not go~bing
2,Broke after 1.5 months,It worked good until it didn't work at all. 8 outings at most and now the shears do not move at all but the motor runs great. A nice novelty gift.
4,DISCONTINUED IT,"They've stopped making this item. That's too bad. I bought two of them. I have a large property and wanted to have one waiting to go when the first one ran out of juice. I like it. It does a good job. I just ordered some replacement blades, since there were still a few in existence.I'm sorry to see this item is no longer made. It is pretty reliable."
1,Absolute junk !!!,"I should have returned this useless piece of junk, but didn't realize how bad it was till later...After owning it about 2 mos. and using it a couple of times the charge is lasting about long enough to trim a 6""x6"" square of tender grass...If you would like to try one I will let you have this one for $1 handling + actual shipping cost...A total piece of crap... I would rate it at a minus one star if I could... Almost turned me against ordering from Amazon.com. even though I know it is not their fault. ...Have a good one...Tater..."
2,To tough to eat.,My teeth hurt for days after trying to eat 1 bag. Threw the rest away. I felt like I was chewing fried pigs teeth.
3,Great optics. Auto find a star didn't work,"The telescope part is great. However, the part that finds stars for you would never work for me. I sent it back to the factory and it came back just the same. Maybe it was something I was doing wrong, but I watched the DVD and followed the instructions to the word..."
2,Poor little JOHNNY,"I found this book to be quite one sided. Way to much pity was given to little Johnny. We all have to get along in the world. Sometimes it is not easy but it has to be done. Johnny comes across to me as a spoiled brat who wants his way. In other words, his way or no way.Everyone has tragedies in their lives, we learn from these experiences he was so poor me. He should get the same treatment his foster mother did. BOO to the author on this one. Maybe she should take the BRAT in. Not worth your money"
5,Definitely helps with inflammation issues!,I have chronic knee inflammation due to severe joint effusion and this product has been a great help in minimizing fluid buildup!
5,An Important Record of an Important Collection,"This catalog chronicles the Pomerance Collection of ancient art at the Brooklyn Museum. These pieces were owned by various members of the Pomerance family and the L. & H. Pomerance Foundation. The book is divided into several sections: Ancient Near Eastern Art, by E.L.B. Terrace; Ancient Egyptian Art, by Bernard V. Bothmer; Ancient Greek Art, by Jean L. Keith; and Etruscan Art, by Jean L. Keith. More than 142 objects are described and accompanied by black-and-white photographs. This is scholarly reference of an important art collection ranging some three millenia."
1,could do better,They have a middle section that fell apart when inserting the cards for the first time. My other ones had foam that held up for years.
2,Not for me,They work. They look cheap and do not hold cards very well. There is another type that works far better.
2,cheap,chose this product because I play alot of card games.they are to loose and if your not real cafeful the cards won't stay in the holder.
1,Card holder set,"I had a set of similar card holders that were really great. I broke one, lost one, and misplaced one. Having only one left, I decided to try to locate new ones. This new set was manufactured in China and the quality has taken a pronounced hit. The plastic components were still alright but the sponge-like inside was too thin. None of the four holders will hold playing cards adequately. The manufacturer needs to do some important quality control."
1,round card holders,"The holders were very disappointing. They are very flimsy, with a polystyrene centre which puckers when you put cards in! Not child friendly at all. Cheap and nasty in fact."
1,Not recommended!,"These card holders were a big disappointment. Very small and hard to use. Rather than a spring-action in the center of the discs to hold the cards in, they simply have a piece of foam on the inside of the disc. After one use, the foam was folded in or mashed down and and the holders were no longer effective. This was a big waste of money."
4,4 piece round card holder and 2 deck rotating card holder,Both products arrived within very few days of ordering them. They are really helpful for handling and manipulating large numbers of cards. We got the card holder specifically for playing Canasta.
2,There card holders are ok.,"These card holder are OK. The padding that is inside them is a little to stiff and will not hold the cards tight. I have used others that have a softer and a little thinker padding in them that work much better. If you do not place the cards in just right you will push the padding down with the cards and you will need to get in there and pull if back up with out pulling the two pieces apart. Some have a gap between the padding and cards will fall out easily, reviling you hand to others."
3,Not too bad for the price,They work quite well out of the bag but have quickly gotten to where they don't hold 13 cards too well. Shape and size were just what I was looking for.
5,Another winner,"Very good information, and it's a book you just take your time and soak all the information in. Great prices."
5,Fantastic,Great historical book. Takes you on the journey from Abraham to the promise land and further. Highly recommend....
3,Book for College Class,"I purchased this book for a Bible class I took. It has some archaeology, and historical items that relate to the Bible, although new findings have been found since this book was published. It touches on the books of the Old Testament, and the time between the testaments, and how those stories agree with historical records and customs of the day. It has some good information, but is not well suited for a study in depth. Also, I don't agree with the statements in the book seeming to not take the Bible to be the literal Word of God. The jumping around between versions was also irritating. If they just used the KJV, they wouldn't have to worry about contradictions. But overall, it was an okay read."
5,Perfect way to stay in repair!,"I have been adding this REPAIR to my morning smoothies daily for about 6 months now, and it's amazing how great my joints feel now. Prior to this I was using glucosimine in tablet form, and it must not have been absorbing as well. My good friend in Hawaii got me hooked on this product, thankfully!I am 59, the proverbial boomer, loving this product! Not sold in most places, so good to find on Amazon.. Try it!"
1,Be careful,"If u want this hair remover never buy it from VCT ELECTRONIC this company send use product it happen 2 times with me , the first I get from them it had even hair inside in the machine from the first owner it's was so dirty and disgusting ... Not recommend this company"
2,not bad but not that good,"maze is an okay anime about a girl who changes to a guy at night one maze founf her self in a mystic world she meets princess mil and others ......infodubbing: weak,not very acting like. back ground music: good . art:okay opening theme:s***s characters:annoying,especially princess mil. well to say so it`s not a very good anime there r other that r much better ....!"
5,Ms. Brockway is a girl's best friend - and a man's!,"I recommend this book to any woman who wants to learn about the Divine Feminine. A Goddess Is a Girl's Best Friend: A Divine Guide to Finding Love, Success, and Happiness gives a solid run down of the Goddesses. Each section provides wonderful exercises, meditations and resources, etc. to further explore the power of the Goddess you have just read about. Give this book to your daughters, sister, best friend - your mother! Heck buy multiple copies for the men in your life, because when you start feeling your Goddess power they will want to know about it too."
5,Every woman deserves this book!,"Whether you are 13 or 30 or 99, this book offers practical wisdom on how to manifest the Goddess in your life and for every occassion. Full of rich and glorious detail about the background of dozens of Goddesses, this book provides the simple steps needed to begin asking the Goddess to help you in manifesting more love, more money, better health and peace of mind. The easy to read format makes it a particularly attractive book. I think this book has the rare combinaton of being both HIP and HOLY.Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Speakers rendered unusable due to cheap components,"These speakers look attractive, sound good for their size, but as many others have noted, may last only a few months before their sound is replaced by pure static. Consider this product to be a disposable item, mine lasted for less than 6 months. The cheap potentiometer used for the volume control seems to be the culprit, and it's a shame that Klipsch does not own up to this problem and upgrade the part. Since other Klipsch speakers share what appear to be identical volume control knobs, this problem has turned me off to all Klipsch powered-speaker products.Save yourself a lot of aggravation and look elsewhere. The M-Audio AV30 is a nice alternative."
1,Garbage can fillers.,"They seemed pretty good in the beginning. Within a year they started with the crackling and rose to near-ear-piercing crackling when the TV went on or off. Not long after that, one speaker died. The remaining speaker would change volume at random---not just during commercials---the speaker volume actually changed. These were soooo overpriced. No more Klipsch."
2,Knobs are faulty,"AS with some others mentioned, these speakers developed problems with the control knobs and have made the speakers unusable. Find maybe another product and research against this problem."
5,Just love these,This is my second pair of these bad boys. I use them with my laptop and recommend them over the Bose by far. They have plenty of power also more than the Bose not ear bleeding but clear crisp and sufficient. They are a bargain at this price.
3,Nice but not perfect,"After 11months of owner ship I must admit that I LOVE Klipsch speakers and the great sound quality that their speakers are able to produce. Alas, 10 months into ownership of the Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 2.0 PC Speaker System the left speaker only work on full volume. It seems the dial for the volume control has gone bad. So sad."
2,not worth the price,"I got them from amazon about 2 months ago. Bought based on user reviews here.I use them to listen to music on my computer.There is no difference between the music from these speakers and other cheapo no-name brand speakers.Also, they don't look as pretty in reality as they do in the picture.Not worth the bother to return so keeping them."
1,Maybe defective because sound was horrible,"I bought these to compare with the Klipsch IGroove for dual purpose Ipod/computer speaker use, but these failed miserably. The Promedia speakers sounded as if someone had left a reverb control on, and Midrange lead vocals were almost non-existent. The cable connection between the speakers stayed loose despite best efforts and one speaker kept fading in and out. I plugged in my old static-ridden radio shack speakers to the same source, same song and they sounded ok. I plugged in the Klipsch Igroove and it sounded ok. (Ok being no reverb and with clear lead vocals.) Tried several songs, same result. So either these were defective or they are just a waste of money. I'm not tempted to spend the time and effort to find out which, so they are going back to the store."
5,Excellent speaker,These speakers give excellent sound and volume and can fit in a bookshelf.They look fairly plain with the grill covers on compared to the photo given showing the bare speakers.
1,speakers fail after a year,"Like many others here, I experienced the dying left speaker. These sounded great when I first got them, but gradually a crackling developed when I adjusted the volume. The left speaker is almost completely useless now. I have to turn the volume knob very carefully to very specific points to even get it to play, and even then I get crackling and lousy sound. These have a major manufacturing flaw, and I would urge everyone to buy a different product. For $100, I feel ripped off, and whatever I buy to replace these, it absolutely will not be a Klipsch product."
1,One speaker dies after a couple of months,"To some of the other reviewers' comments here, the left speaker eventually dies over time. My first set died in less than a year and was replaced under warranty. The same issue (left speaker does over time; play with the connections, but problem didn't improve) re-appeared a couple months later, but unfortunately, my speakers are now past their warranty. I would not re-purchase."
3,Short Lifespan,"Its true.. these and all the promedia speakers sound awesome. However, to date i have had two pairs of these and a set of the klipsh 5.1 speakers. All of which have had some major failure within a year. After about 9 months, both sets of these now cut in and out. If you turn them off and back on and play with the volume control they may come back on for a period and randomly cut out again. The worst part is that Klipsch will not honor any warranty without an original sales receipt. So be sure to keep yours. Sadly, i did not keep mine."
1,Cracking and popping/ no power,"These speakers sound great for a few months but they fall apart. The sound goes away randamly and the speakers snap, crackle, and pop like breakfast cereal. The speakers get worse over time until one must frequently turn them off and back on again to make them work. Don't buy these speakers."
1,Great until they fail,"Bought these in Feb 2008 for the wife. Great sound, small profile, then after a few months (about 1 week of actual playing time) they went dead.the seller, AB Electronics will not respond to e-mails. Bought a LogitechX-140 2.0 Speaker system for 1/2 the price and they work better."
2,Exellent sound until volume knob failure,"March 2008 UPDATE: Speakers ceased working. $100 speakers should last longer than 15 months! I will not buy Klipsch products again.For their size and price these speakers deliver impressive sound and are attractive as well. However, Klipsch puts a cheap volume control potentiometer in these units resulting in loud static and sound cut-out when the knob is turned. This started to be a minor nuisance about a year after purchase but has now become a major nuisance. Often no sound comes out of the left speaker until the volume knob is vigorously jiggled and then it is usually at only a low volume. (Also, a foot came off one of the speakers soon after purchase but was easily glued back on)."
1,Beware of These Speakers!!!,"I had a very similar experience to ""W. Bailey"" and ""Phillip Crosby"" below. There is a fundamental flaw in the design. The sound on the secondary speaker will get very shaky (i.e., play inconsistently). Minor fiddling with the on/volume knob will restore the sound temporarily, but slowly and surely, the connection to the secondary speaker will become gradually more and more tenuous until you are pretty much left with only one functioning speaker. Again, given the similar experiences of other reviewers, I strongly suspect this is a fundamental flaw in design. In sum, AVOID THESE SPEAKERS if you want them to last more than a year."
1,volume uncontrolled,"My speakers are no longer usable after only a year. The volume knob is shorting out terribly. It crackles and pops and the volume jumps all over the place when I turn it. After reading the number of reviews with the same problem, I'm done buying Klipsch equipment."
5,Sound great,"What more to say - they sound good. The bass maybe isn't quite as potent as a system with a dedicated subwoofer, but still respectable and doesn't sound mushy. They're excellant for an office or apartment somewhere you can't really have a sub, or if you're like me and like to hear something other than just the thump at the bottom of the music!"
5,Perfect For Apartment - Awesome Sound!,"I wanted some good speakers for my new laptop and the Klipsch ProMedia Ultra fit my needs perfectly. They're compact and fit easily on my computer desk, and since there's no subwoofer it was easy to set them up within a couple of minutes without huge tangles of wire all over the place.They look very stylish and best of all they are POWERFUL! They won't blow out the windows of the office down the street, but I wouldn't want them to. They fill my room with beautiful clear sound with the volume control turned up only halfway or less, with crisp highs and good rich bass, without static or interference of any kind.I'm not an audiophile and couldn't care less. These speakers are great, they fulfill my needs completely at a very reasonable price. If that's what is important to you, I can recommend these speakers without hesitation."
4,best for the money,"If you don't want a 2.1 system and still want lots of volume, bass, and quality - these speakers are the best value. I tried bose twin speakers for pc. Honestly they were so soft I couldn't hear them in another room. If you use your computer as your main stereo, like myself, then these speakers are a must. Get them from a reputable seller however, I had to purchase another set since the first set I bought sounded distorted and buzzy. I gave the klipsch another chance, though, and I'm glad I did.Also, they have a black soft cover - the picture doesn't show that, but they look pretty sleek with my home computer system.The amount of sound that comes from these little guys is incredible - and clear!"
1,Not a good experience,"Wow! I believed the writeups about how wonderful these speakers were. I should not have, they are terrible! #1 they are much, much bigger that the pictures show,#2 they sound awful - mushy, unclear. They are a poor excuse for a speaker system. No amount of tweaking with the equalizer made them sound any better. They are just no good at all, in my opinion. I am an audiofile from many years ago, I and my ears know what I am talking about.My recommendation is: DO NOT BUY. -- FOR ANY PRICE!"
2,Amazing sound... poor construction.,"I purchased these speakers knowing Klipsch's sound performance first hand with my Promedia 5.1's which I have had for over 6 years. When I first got this set of speakers, I was amazed at the sound quality and bass coming out of these two speakers. However, very soon after using them, the bass kept going in and out, leaving only the high frequency sound to come out. Only after fiddling with the bass knob would the bass come back, but even then the bass would frequently cut out. After much frustration, I sent the speakers back for a refund. I didn't want to deal with another set and possibly having another poorly constructed speaker set.Don't get me wrong, these speakers are AMAZING, as far as sound quality, however, the construction is very poor and needs much work. If you are able to get a hold of a quality constructed version of these speakers, then by all means, you should get these speakers."
2,good concept; poor execution.,"I had high hopes for these speakers, largely due to the Klipsch reputation. Apparently that reputation was earned with higher quality products than the speakers I purchased from them.The sound is decent, if only they would keep working. I am continually having to disconnect-reconnect cables hoping to restore sound to one or the other of them. The headphone jack has always had intermittent problems. Every month or two I have to spend an hour fiddling around with them to get them to work.That qualifies as junk in my book. I will be replacing them with a different brand."
2,AC Adapter connection is flimsy - will turn off at the slightest movement,"The sound quality is a plus. Having a bass control knob is a plus. The volume and bass knobs are hard to turn - a slight negative, but not a big deal. The weight of the speakers are also a slight negative. The worst part about the speakers was the flimsy AC adapter connection in the back. The hole in the back is not deep enough so the slightest movement of the speakers or the AC adapter, disconnects the power to the speakers. If you nudge the speaker while adjusting the volume or try to reposition the speaker, the power disconnects. I got so irritated that I used these speakers one day and exchanged them for Bose Companion 2 - because they were the same price. I suppose you could find good speakers that are less expensive than these, but for the most part (exceptions are noted) there's a slight correlation between price and quality. Please read my review on Bose Companion 2."
5,"Great bargain, great sound.","Klipsch won me over in the past with their 2.1 and 5.1 systems, but I needed to get rid of the subwoofer (too much space, too much bass), and these beauties are great (and cheap). I have an extensive collection of music, ranging from classical to industrial, and it handles all of it with aplomb. It shines most with rock (try Point of Know Return -- takes me back to high school!), but it handles opera and symphonies, too.But let's get real. All this talk of inadequate ""soundstaging,"" etc., is ridiculous. These are not audiophile speakers. They're $99.00 speakers. And, for what they are, there is no competition (and I've listened to about a dozen others).Nicely designed with a small footprint, the ProMedia Ultra 2.0 System easily earns 5 stars."
2,Don't bother with these,"The speakers worked fine for about a year then began ""popping"". Now I have to fiddle with the volume control to get both speakers to work. This is not a quality item."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought these speakers less than a year ago. The sound was crisp--the way I like it--until the chintzy volume control began to get noisy. Finally the sound became so ugly that I tore the amp module open to see if I could clean or replace the volume control. I couldn't. I tossed everything in the dumpster and wish I hadn't been seduced by the ""Klipsch"" name. This certainly isn't Klipsch quality from days past but just a too-spendy Asian piece of throw-away junk.Shame on them."
3,"Great sound, terrible design","I really loved these speakers at first. The plug that attaches to the back of the speaker had a short in it and it had to be bent just the right way to get the speakers to work. Since then I have had a lot of problems with the speakers not working. When they are working, they sound great, but I am dissappointed with their design quality. I am still very partial to Klipsch, I just feel they dropped the ball on this one!"
3,"Good, but not worth the $","I purchased these to use with a Zen Micro. I thought I was going to be blown away by the sound since I have always heard so much about Klipsch but they were just OK. I have a pair of 10 year old Altec Lansing computer speakers that are about the same size and I think the Altec's sound better. The bass is weak, and the mid-range is not that great. Another consideration is that, in my opinion, they are too bulky and heavy for use with a portable. Even though they are narrow, they are quite deep. Each speaker is heavy and there is also a heavy power adapter ""brick"". Bottom line is that I think you can get computer speakers that are just as good for a lot less money."
5,Not bad for its size and price...,The 5 stars were given in consideration of its comparative value in its class.If you have to chose a pair of speakers of this size... this is a good choice. Far better than Bose companion 2.0 and it is a huge upgrade from the OEM speakers. The bass is excellent if you consider its size and mids are acceptable. I hope the highs can be cisper.See my review of Bose Companion 2.0 speakers and other 2.1 systems.
2,Frustrating... too bad I bought 2 pairs before I knew...,"I use these for my XM radio. I was a fan of these speakers until I started having the same problem with the volume control that many others are having. Suddenly one day I realized that only one speaker was working. I turned up the volume and both speakers were loud with static. The silent speaker worked again, but as you turn the speakers down to a level that allows for normal conversation, one speaker will again go silent. It's a chronic issue. I've put up with it for the past year and a half or so. I have not tried the fix as detailed by Kid Rage in an earlier review (thanks, Kid!). As these get older, the problem just gets worse - forget about adjusting volume - you'll lose sound completely. I expected better from a company with a name as old as Klipsch."
3,not bad - but there are better,"satisified, but would prefer the creatives - seperate bass & treble knobs"
3,Great sound in small packages,"I purchased these speakers about 2 weeks ago, and they have made a nice difference in my home computing audio situation...much better bass and sound separation, except my only dislike is in the volume.. i feel like i've got to pump it up to get a really clean sound...but other than that, i love them!"
4,I came. I heard. I'm sold.,"I wanted something portable without cluttering my room with a subwoofer.When I first tried these, I got some booming sound with very rich tones. I was hearing elements that I wasn't before from the same mp3s. After getting up to move the speakers, imagine the shock when I saw that I hadn't connected the left speaker, and was only listening to 1 speaker.The base is more than enough for me although it depends on the surface. Bass was much more powerful on my sturdy entertainment center than on my flimsy computer desk. I daresay I felt the subsonics in my living room.Cons? Right out of the box, there was static when turning the volume knob. There are instructions in the Klipsch forum on how to clean that out. I would've also liked to see a separate power button from the volume knob.I chose these over the Bose Companion II's because these have an extra input in the front."
3,not good,"I would give a five star to this product when I first bought it 8 months ago, the sound was just fabulous, but now, after 8 months use, one of the speaker is dying, I won't recommend a product that can't last to my friends"
1,Not worth it.,"I purchased these speakers in August 2006 and for the last year they have slowly been dying and now they have kicked the bucket. I don't know, is 3 years a good lifespan for a 90-dollar pair of speakers? Not in my book. At the best of time, they were just okay, with annoying crackling sounds when you change the volume on the right speaker, and never the ability to really get up there in loudness."
1,"excellent sound, poor quality and workmanship",The sound reproduction was great. I started having trouble with the connection to the second speaker in less then 6 months. The connection went dead in a year. To bad because the sound quality was excellent.
2,Great when they work...,"I've got nothing new to add to many of the less than favorable reviews of these speakers. Bottom line is they sound great out of the box, but aren't built to last. Like a lot of other reviewers, mine developed a problem with crackling and static in less than a year. It's not a problem if you don't mind leaving your speakers on 24/7 and never adjusting the volume/bass. Personally, I'd rather have a pair of speakers that do what they're designed to do without crapping out after 6-12 months."
2,Faulty adjustment dials,"These things are great out of the box, but not so much six months later when you suddenly only get sound out of the right speaker and the crackle every time you rotate the volume or base. Previous reviewers are right, the faulty adjustment dials basically doom the speakers and these should be avoided because of it. I should note that after my first set died I sent them back and Klipsch sent a replacement set no questions asked. Which then promptly died as well six months later."
2,Loss of Sound / Popping / Cracking after 6 months,"Love the speakers until they stopped working properly. They worked great initially and look really nice.However, after six months the sound goes out and popping noise comes from the speakers on a daily basis. The only way to get the sound to come back on is to turn off the speakers frequently.I even replaced my sound card thinking it was something other than the speakers. Come to find out it is a fairly common problem with these speakers. Do a Google search and you will see more people complaining about them.Luckily I purchased a replacement warranty for $10 bucks so I was able to return them and get a $100 gift card.Buyer beware..."
5,Awesome razor,"I've tried Gillette adjustables and tech razors. This Merkur razor beats them. I have a tough beard and some pain with shaving using some razors, but this Merkur razor cuts hair like nothing else I've used. People say this one is aggressive and not for someone not familiar with DE shaving, but don't believe that. It's a great razor. If you have a soft beard, either be very careful with it or get something less aggressive. However if you have a tough beard and want a good safety razor, I'd get this one... oh wait, I already did, and I'm happy with it."
3,What's the slant bar for?,"A little hard to use, since no explanation of slant bar was given. This was a gift and it has a good feel, I am just a little unfamiliar with the reason for the slant."
1,Judgement Night,I hated the music on this CD. The only track I liked on the whole CD was track 2 and I love it - I play that track over and over.
5,the ulitimate mix of rap and eveything else (remarkable)!!!!,well lets forget about the movie .even though dennis leary has some good one lineres.this is one of the best albums that mixes rap with any style of music that is in todays medium as far as i can see. you got rap meets metal(well we know that formula)rap meets grunge(well thats some what dated but cool)rap meet hard core (how it should be done )rap meets indi(only done the best way)rap meets progessive(you wont belive your ears)rap meets trip hop(just amazing)rap meets polically correct(how can it be)so to put it the many formulas of this style is here for you[r] listening pleasure....
3,They seem a little dull,"I would give them 2 stars if they were priced higher(1 star is for total junk). Compared to some other bits I have used, these seemed dull. Drilled some oak, bit got hot before I was half way through a 3/4 inch piece, I was using a drill press and had some spray on coating that helps keep bits cool. Doing the job, fair value for the cost, I will get by with them in my home shop,replacing the sizes I use often with something better. Not for the pro!"
1,"POOR PRODUCT - DON""T EVER BUY IT","My MP3 player got repaired within 2 months. I am very unhappy to have a product (MP3 player) after RMA. It has come out with so many scratches on the display a old piece (its not because of shipping). Even though the product is under warranty, the customer service is very bad. A product in US within warranty period will be replaced for a new one for betterment of the customer but this goes to Hongkong for any repairs. This is the last time I purchase a product from FRONTIER LAB and will ask my well-wisher not to purchase any product from 'FRONTIER LAB' -Very sorry for saying this: A POOR CUSTOMER SERVICEThanks for all the problems I had with a worth of $230 purchase. Its a mere waste for me."
1,Poor craftsmanship and customer support,"Be careful, all service requires mailing to Hong Kong! My L1 stopped working within 3 weeks without dropping or jarring it and now I have to mail it to Hong Kong. Customer Service was unable to diagnose anything to help it other than to try to reset it and format the drive, neither of which worked. I've never had any serious problems with any electronics that I bought before, so I went with a cheaper brand, but the savings and features do not make up for poor craftsmanship and now the cost of international mailing for repair."
1,honest opinion,my honest opinion is that this product was not all that it was said to be. it worked fine for the first couple of weeks then when i wanted to turn the device on it would not turn on but the hard drive was running.
3,What I don't understand...,"I bought this product as my OEM charger was only putting out 11.5V (static) to charge the 12V battery on my Sears electric start lawnmower. This new one also only put out 11.5V, but, guess what? My old one does charge my battery. After testing my old one connected up and operating, it was putting out 14V+. Obviously, I did not understand what was happening. It would only be necessary to buy this new item if your old charger was lost, stomped on, or otherwise damaged. I don't understand how my old one tested at 11.5V static and 14V+ connected and operating. Another of life's mystery's! This product worked fine, I just didn't need it!"
3,Didn't solve my problem,"Unfortunately, this didn't solve my charging problem. Either this is not charging the battery or I need a new battery. Still starting the lawn mower the manual way."
1,Misleading title,"The product works but it is not original part as claimed in the title of the item. I found this to be misleading. The connector is filmsy and everytime, I disconnect, I pray that it does not come off completely. The quality is nowhere comapred to the original that came with the mower"
5,saving grace,Love my lawn mower but was upset when the original charger fell apart and Sears told me I had to go online to get a replacement. Found this one and was very pleased when I received it because it was the perfect replacement at a fraction of what Sears wanted.
3,Watch your fingers!,"I got two of these on sale at Joann Fabrics (can't find it on their website now though) for 35.99 each. They look like a good idea, but the double seal on the cases means that it is kind of tricky to get them to line up perfectly each time you close them. It is very easy to pinch your fingers! I like the idea of keeping the dust out of the drawers, and I bet it is handy for travelling with scrapbooking projects (I don't do scrapbooking but have other hobbies). Also I think these would be great for storing unfinished LEGO projects! But watch your fingers !"
1,Warning Does not fit,This product did not fit. it was about an half inch shorter than the original and the lines would not hook up. 1998 Saturn SL2
2,Couldn't finish it,"The story is a fascinating one, yet in this book it isn't told very well. Norton tries to make a connection with the Salem hysteria and wars with the Indian's in Maine. I didn't really think she connected it very well, and only confuses the reader by going back and forth with the time period and not really explaining the connection(unless she thinks it is obvious, which it isn't). And as another reviewer has written the style is choppy and dry... you have to really be boring to make this story boring and she succeeds. Look for another book on the subject if you are interested. I will be trying to sell my HB at my local used book store."
3,"Don't do it, unless...","You are a history professor. Imagine that you and all the other American Colonial history experts and academicians have gathered for your annual conference. Prof. Mary Beth Norton presents her theories on the political and historical context of the Salem witchcraft trials; more than anything she is determined that her vigorous scholarchip and extensive notes will bolster the plausibility of her findings.Are you bored yet? Well that's this book in a nutshell. I did finish the book but good gracious, who would have thought that this most fascinating episode of colonial America could possibly be SUCH dry reading? I should have read the reviews before buying it.I am grateful for all the time and effort that clearly went into this book. And to tell the truth, I will never again think of the witch hunt period as separate from the first and second Indian wars. Like I said, her scholarship is unimpeachable. But I would recommend reading a chapter or two before purchasing this book."
2,"Terrible read, but lots of information","This book has a lot of great information and an interesting analysis of what was behind the hysteria. However, it's not very readable. I cannot understand why Norton can't take a quote and tell it in her own words. The multiple quotes in nearly every sentence, and in Old English, made reading this book like watching paint dry. On the other hand, it's a great tranquilizer: I fell asleep several times reading it."
4,worth the trouble,"Norton's book is not pleasurable reading, in the sense that it's difficult to get through. There are so many names and so many references, you just can't get a smooth read going.However, it's so much better than the typical colonial american history book, it's worth the trouble. The witchraft hysteria has never been adequately explained, until now. Norton traces the accused and accusers to coastal Maine, where attacks by both French and native americans took a heavy toll in the 1670s and '80s, causing severe emotional trauma and generating gossip. Most coastal Maine families moved to northeast Massachusetts, to towns like Salem, Andover, Boxford, Haverhill, etc. and the accusers tended to come from them.It's the only explanation that makes any sense. Previous attempts to portray the hysteria as resulting from economic divisions were never able to make sense of the judges sending twenty innocent people to their deaths with only the vaguest of evidence."
5,I love Accu chek cpmpact test strips,Accu chek test strips is the best i have already recommend it to my family and friends its easy to use.
4,accu-check 102 test strips.,"though i did receive 102 strips, they came as (2) 51 count boxes. this is the second time ive ordered them and gotten the smaller size. i believe they offer 102 as a single box but dont have them."
4,Requires very little sample size. Fast and easy to use.,"The Accucheck product is unique with its preloaded cartridges. This makes it easy to use. It requires only a small droplet of blood. The monitor will tell you how many strips are left, making it easier to keep track. And loading the new cartridge is an easy as popping it in. Very easy!U"
5,"Very usefull, excellent","This is the most usefull way for measuring the glicemia levels on people suffering from diabetes. I only wish accu-check could sell the automatic device in Chile where my mother lives. I only got the device in the USA and not in Chile, and I had to buy the replacing cartridges only in the US."
5,Loving It,Excellent item. I am loving learning how to use it. Glad to have it in my list of treasured items.
4,mos eisley cantina,"It's great but the only reason why i didn't rate it five stars is becaus it kept on breaking.it took me about 3-4 days to build it. it stressed me becuuse the bendy wires would keep popping out of land speeder,but other than that it's auwesome!"
3,Good Book - Not Great,"I found out about this book through Nassim Taleb's recommendation in his book ""The Black Swan."" For Taleb to recommend a book on investing considering his views of Wall Street, it intrigued me.After finsihing the book I thought it was good - nothing great. The first half of the book was about one of the author's career path to where he got to be. I did not find the stories that entertaining. The second half of the book discusses how not to get emotionally involved and to have an investment plan. It's just common sense.In closing a novice might get something out of it but for a veteran like me, I have read better behavioral finance books. Check out Nick Murray's works."
4,Red Sunday,"I read this book twice. The beginning could be a movie. That later part of the book just goes into later history. Well written.My ancestor was an ""AYER"" and this book brought to light some of their hardships. Hard to imagine living like that today."
3,Venoms + Demons = Real strange,"The venoms star in a film involving one man and his need for revenge. After missing death by the narrowist of margins he is offerd help by a demon, who wants his soul in return. driven by hatred he accepts his offer, and begins his blood drive with the help of the 9 demons. Very strange film, some amazing imaginative scenes, with some great fight scenes. A lot more talk then fighting wich may be the only down aspect."
1,it's such a poorly written book!,"we use it as a text book only because roussas teaches here. a lot of students have given bad reviews to this book because it's not readable at all! it doesn't provide any examples for a lot of the thms, and it's very hard to keep track of everything. for example it'll say on page xxx, reffer to thm x.xx, and example xx on chapter xx. @_@ drives you nuts!!!"
3,It is ok.,"I had the same parfume which I bought in Europe and it was more steady smell. Since it is no choise in America, I would say - it is ok. The smell itself I love a lot."
3,NAVIPLAY BLUETOOTH STEREO TRANSMITTER,When it works it works well. Battery seems to die after approximately 6-8 months of use. Pairs well with most devices. Battery lidfe/durability is the big issue.
4,Great for the price,"I'm impressed with it for how cheap it is. I use it with the Motorola S9 headset. It works well, is clear and loud, but it will cut out sometimes. I can't really put a finger on what type of movement causes it to cut out. Sometimes I can jog and it will broadcast just fine, and other times just walking will cause it to cut out. Overall the problems are brief and manageable."
2,Not the best choice,"The thing is not bad, but the battery run out very quickly and is very bulky also"
1,Save your six bucks,"This thing just does not pair. I am trying to use it with my Motorola s805 headphones in my ski helmet. I have followed the instructions to the letter and have spent alot of time watching the ""rapidly blinking green and amber lights"" as it tries to pair but never does.I have no problem pairing my phone with these headphones, by the way.Thought I could get bluetooth with my ipod on the cheap, but just ended up wasting time and money. Stay away from this thing."
1,Not worth the money I payed for it,"I have never been able to use this product. I bought it to pair with my Jabra bluetooth headphones, but it would not pair with them. Reading the manual that was included, the product would prefer you use it with the Motorola bluetooth headphones. I bought those and it doesn't work with those either, so this was a small waste of money for me."
4,Works fine,"It's a little bulky to carry around, but if you leave it in a central location, the range is fine. I connected mine to my Motorola S9 with no problems."
4,works as advertised,Easily synched with my motorola 505. works well. have not use it as much as I thought so no thoughts on durability thus only 4 stars. Seems sturdy enough though.
1,What a piece of junk,"This was cheaply made, never connected up to my unit and never paired to the wireless headphones I bought.I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was a waste of money to buy."
1,pretty sad,"This product was very difficult to set up (a small light, blinks green, red, amber during the setup - tough to distinguish). It ended up not working at all with my Motorola Wireless Headset (S805). When I went to check the manufacturer's website, I found they were out of business. Fortunately, I was able to return the device to CCMACCESSORIES for a full refund. SONY makes a device that does the same thing (much smaller,a bit pricier - maybe $65) - I purchased that and it worked immediately."
1,NO PAIR NO WAY,"I REALY TRIED TO PAIR THIS DEVICE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE. IT WOULD NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING I HAVE. AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS ABLE TO PAIR MOTOROLA 850 HEADPHONES TO MY RAZOR PHONE, AND MAC MINI. ALSO PAIRED PALM TO MINI. REPLACED WITH A MOTOROLA BLUETOOTH BASE DC200 AND ANYCOM BLUETOOTH IPOD ADAPTER FROM ANTONLINE . ALL PAIRED WITHOUT A PROBLEM. I AM A MACHINIST IN A LOUD SHOP. ALL THE ABOVE ITEMS WORK GREAT. EXCEPT THE TEN TECH. BLUETOOTH"
3,good missing piece,"The purchaser was amazing; the original product i got was missing a piece and they were kind enough to send me another one free of additional charges. Unfortunately, that one was also missing the crucial piece I needed, so I'm not even sure if the darn thing works. But 5 stars for the person I bought this from!"
3,Good for the price... but bulky,"I purchased this ipod adapter for the simple reason the it cost only [...] bucks withfree shipping, so it was a pretty good deal. But in the end you get what you pay for.The body is constructed out of extremely cheap plastic and is an arduous task to get itin and out of your pocket due to the size. The bluetooth connection was pretty good anddidnt drain too much energy from, my ipod. Overall it was an non-regrettable purchase"
4,"Enjoyable, but scattered","I have enjoyed the book so far and have found many things I wasn't doing. With that being said, I felt that the chapters were very scattered. It seems like they had a good thought, but it isn't clearly written.I have read many of John's books and this one doesn't have his usual flow. It seems that his co-author did the majority of the writing and John just added a blurb in at the end of the chapter.I enjoyed John Maxwell's leadership books better."
4,Great information.,I was expecting for this to be a piece or portion of one of John Maxwell's speeches.It was narrorated by Les Parrott. Lots of great info.
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of other John Maxwell books; this book let me down. First the reading of the author was painful to listen too. A different reading style would have made this more enjoyable to listen to. Second, there's a lot of overlap between the material in this book and other Maxwell books."
3,Not his best work!,This is co-authored by John and Les. Les does not write well and does not add much value to Johns ideas. So essentially only 1/2 of this book is worth reading.
1,Big Price Hike,"In July 2009, this two-pack was $18.99 TOTAL, and Amazon Prime provided free shipping.Ten Stars for the product. Minus 10 for the price hike.Shop around."
4,The Parkinsons Disease Treatment Book,"Being just diagnosed with Parkinsons, I was anxious to learn more about Parkinsons and what my long-range prognosis might be. My Neurologist recommended this book, and I quickly ordered it from Amazon. The author practices at Mayo Clinic, and recommends the use of Carbidopa/Levidopa as a first treatment course for those with Parkinsons. After reading 3/4 of the book, I feel much more familiar and comfortable with the subject of Parkinsons as well as the various courses of treatment, of which there are several. I can recommend this book wholeheartedly to others who are just beginning their association with this disease as well as to those who are several years into the experience."
5,A must read for Parkies,"I wish I had read this book as soon as I was diagnosed. It has the most comprehensive and easily understandable information of anything I have seen on Parkinsons Disease. From the importance of things we take for granted to exact timing of taking our meds, he covers it all, things your Doctor doesn't have time to tell you, the reasoning behind it all. A very good book!"
5,Very valuable book,This book is a major resource for better understanding Parkinson's and how those of us with PD can make the best of it.
5,The PD Treatment Book,"If anyone in family has PD, this is the best help you can give them. It is concise and most informative and can give you info that you can share with the doctors. Most doctors are not that well informed about PD unless they are specialists and then you can both give the person with PD the best help they need."
4,Doctor on call 24/7,"I would recommend this book for anyone who is facing the challenges associated with Parkinson's Disease. Every question imaginable is listed however on occasion the wording can be a little challenging without a medical degree. Overall I would rate this book as a ""must have"" in your journey to better understanding this disease."
5,Very Informative for Parkinsons's patient and caregiver ---,This is an excellent book written in layman's terms. Easy to read and easy to understand. My husband (Parkinson's patient) and I have both found it very helpful and informative. We highly recommend it.
1,"TEKTON by MIT 1012 1/4-Inch and 3/8-Inch Drive Socket Set, SAE/Metric, 40-pc.","Buy it for the sockets, not the ratchet.The ratchet has a plastic reversing switch and twisted off after a single use.I have never seen such cheap construction in a ratchet before!Buyer beware!!!"
5,reasonable,Reasonable for the price. Case is efficient and keeps everything neat. The rachet won't take much pressure but it is a deal for the price.
3,Stronger Seniors Workout Program,I think it was good. Anne Pringle Burnell seems to target all the different parts of the body with her exercises.
4,Stronger Seniors gift,The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and was just what my mom (80 yrs. young) was looking for.
1,"Returning this, Its to long and looks boring.","Returning this, Its to long and looks boring. The dvd is a hour long and my aunt got bored with it."
1,To Long Slow and Boring.,"This DVD is about a hour long very long and boring. The exercises seem ok, nothing special. The brick wall in the background is very unappealing."
4,Stronger Seniors,Good pointers to pick up from these DVDs. I use some of the moves frequently when teaching my Seniors new stuff.
4,Works very well for my Mom,Bought this for my elderly Mom who needs to stay active according to her doctor. She really likes doing the exercises and has choices on the ones she is able to do. The instructor is very good on the DVD. Would recommend this to anyone with even limited mobility that needs to do exercises in a chair.
2,Stronger Seniors,I haven't really used it very much. I have found that I am able to exercise normally since I had a knee replacement.
4,Great Senior Exercise,"Didn't realize how out of shape I am. This was easy to follow, simple stretches but I was a bit sore the next day (out-of-shape). I felt great when I was finished and would easily recommend to a friend. No stress on joints and is just what I'm looking for at this time."
3,Seniors,I'm 62 and have exercised alot in my life. This dvd is good if you have never exercised before in your life.
3,a good stretch,This is a good DVD for people who have not exercised in years and/or for people who are VERY stiff. Gets old very fast and I used it for only about 4 weeks -- then moved on to another senior exercise DVD. Purchase this only if you plan on doing the basics over and over and over.....
3,"Good exercises, but not for cognitively challenged","I did these with my mother who is developing dementia, and she managed the exercises on the stretching disc, but the strength disc was too complicated and fast for her to keep up with. It's too bad, because she could really benefit from the movements."
5,Stronger Seniiors,Great dual workouts. Do every other day and you can really feel the difference. I would recommend these workouts to anyone.........not just seniors.
4,Good chair exercixe,This is a good exercise video for seniors and adults. Does provide ample exercise and is easy to follow. along with the instructor.
4,"Great work out, a little quick paced","My residents at work love doing this workout. However, we've done it a number of times, and they are still finding it a little hard to follow, because it is pretty fast-paced for them."
5,doable,It is not exhausting. Warms up the limbs. At the begining don't do every day. Do one tape at a time. Rotate the tapes you do. Hoping one day to continue the every other day routine but to do both tapes at a time. I recommend this tape for seniors to get so they have some thing to follow. Aids in making a good routine of exercise.
5,Stronger Seniors exercise DVD,"My grandma is a very spry 93 years old. Sound in both mind and body. She was using a VCR tape of exercises designed for Seniors, but it stopped working properly. I looked for the same video on DVD, but it was old enough that it didn't come in DVD. So, I ordered this one for her. She found that this Stretch and Strength DVD was an excellent mix of the exercises she found helpful. She gives it a 2 thumbs up, which is a lot for her to say as she can be very opinionated!"
4,Good Halloween story,"My granddaughters are a bit too young for the lengthy dialogue, but I was able to take some editorial license and string together a shortened version. They both, however, loved the familiar pictures of Pooh and all his friends. They are both at the age where they are starting to understand the various customs associated with holidays, soDisney's Boo to You, Winnie the Pooh!was a nice story to talk about Halloween and what it means."
4,"BOO To You, Winnie the Pooh!","I think this was a fun book to read. How friends stick together, through thick and thin. Even though you may be so scared, but your friend's in trouble so you put your self out on the line to help them. I think that's what friendship is all about! It teaches kids how to help other people and make friends. It doesn't matter how big or little you are, you can help people at any age, and this book helps kids realize this. You make more friends when you help and encourage people. In this book, it shows how close these friends are and what they will do for each other. That's why I enjoyed this book so much, because I know how much friends mean. You need friends to get through life from day, to day, and kids need to know this. I would recommend this book to many."
1,"didn't live up to expectations, disappointing & meandering","The premise is exciting and unusual, however the promise is never fulfilled. The Visitation for which the book is named is incidental in the book and goes nowhere. Characters come in and out of the protagonists' lives with no rhyme or reason and do not affect any change in the characters (in particular, the Virgin Mary has no immediate or apparent affect on the two main characters's lives). They serve no purpose. Characters who could be interesting are left behind with no further storyline. The story takes many directions only to not develop any and instead go on yet another direction. This could have been a coming of age story, it could have been comic, it could have been compelling, unfortunately, it is none of those things."
2,"Good premise, weak execution","The book begins strongly, and there were some very Catholic moments. However, the author never developed the theme of Mary coming to earth to deliver a message to the Pope. The ending seemed incongruous with the rest of the book."
1,Not novel material,"I was deceived by the comment on the cover from Fay Weldon, whose work I have enjoyed in the past. Unfortunately, this book has none of the bite of Weldon's work. The first chapter was amusing, but after that the novel droned on. Most likely would have made a funny SHORT story - but it didn't work for a novel."
4,"Brown descendant gives it a ""thumbs up"" for children","As one of the real ""unsinkable"" Mrs. Brown's great granddaughters, the more I read this book, the more I enjoy the spirit and warmth of it. Molly's life was gradually embellished into legend even in her own lifetime and through her own telling, so it is appropriate that the book takes her dramatic flair to extremes with the Mississippi River story, a yarn Ms. Blos invented. Now that the 1997 movie has renewed the interest in Titanic and endeared her character to a generation of teens, this book is a good version of her great American legacy, in-a-nutshell, for the younger kids. No, it's not all true, but neither is Washington's cherry tree story. The illustrations are fabulous and include many real-life outfits and decor Molly owned, down to the family photographs on her wall."
5,Great Book!,This was a great book! I used it as my subject for a book report on a bigoraphy and it gave all of the info. i needed. Wonderful book...lots of specific details and fun facts!!! awesome book for kids AND adults who are interested in the Titanic. VERY nice picures and fun to read!!!!! Two thumbs up!
2,somewhat helpful,"I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping to find detailed information on firing techniques other than traditional kiln. It did provide this information; however, no detailed information was provided on how to use/position tin to preserve glazing...this was the essential information I was looking for and thought the book would give detailed instructions on how to do this. The book did give good information on a variety of techniques used by potters all over the world, and it was very interesting...but not the ""how to"" I was hoping for. There was information on building outdoor kilns...and how to fire, which would be helpful to more experienced potters. Not exactly a book for beginners, like me."
3,Arcade 3 in 1 game,"The game is cute and fun. It does not fold up as easy as it says! So, beware on that. Other than that, they have had fun playing with it. Age recommended for 2yrs and up."
1,This is the worst DVD ever,My husband and I think this is so bad real bad....can'r beleive she's a teacher......Tap dance made easy is the best...I am new Ginger please explain the steps...what the heck is a shuffle to a beginner....Oh I see you want me to quess....save your money folks
1,"20"" drill press","This 20"" drill press will last for years. It is the lowest priced 20"" drill press on the market. Not the cheapest. G's service is great. I have needed parts for the G machines I own and they have sent them free with no charge. I have a small proto type shop and I use this drill press for metal drilling. It works great. Of the 74 machines I own 7 are Grizazly and I would buy them again."
1,An Elephant not a Grizzly!,"This is poorest quality ""tool"" I have in my shop. The Jacobs spindle wobbles, the table adjustments don't lock in place. The table moves while I'm drilling. The vertical shaft was rusted when I received it.The junk was all shipped in a single box and the 100+ pound motor smashed the shroud around the belts and put a big dent in the vertical shaft. Oh, Grizzly sent a new shroud, but I had to buy a pulley puller to replace it. I also had to buy a block and tackle to lift the humongous motor on top of the vertical shaft. It is one hunk of cast iron that was made in China. They hide the mistakes in casting by adding more iron.While Grizzly advertises that this drill is variable speed, you have to change two belts and three different variable sized pulleys for a total of 15 different settings.I will never, NEVER buy anything from Grizzly again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GRIZZLY PRODUCT!!!!!!!,"After ordering $26,000 worth of Powermatic equipment from Amazon, I ordered this press. I was called on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, and told I had to accept it the next day or agree to pay $50 per day ""storage,"" or it would be returned and I would be charged for all shipping. I had never been given such a ransom demand from any shippers from Powermatic. Grizzly customer service was rude, demanding, and downright embarrassing to deal with. I simultaneously ordered $60 worth of Grizzly attachments, which are now worthless, and they won't accept a return. Lesson - DONT BUY GRIZZLY!!!!!!!"
3,cute but to big for a small dog,to thin for a big dog to carry a suit case like zipper broke second day dog had no lesh attachment to stay in
4,"He is a gunslinger, she is the sherrif's daughter...","Logan Tanner rides into town with only one purpose in mind--to avenge his father's death from the hands of the sheriff, Frank Tyrell...but he meets Tyrell's daughter, Beth. And now he must choose between love and revenge.This is a really beautiful love story--it tells us how love can change the hardest of hearts."
4,A Fun Romance,"I'm a huge fan of Francine River's Christian fiction and am always looking for something new for her. This book popped up in my recommendations and I wasn't disappointed. It's a fun romance novel that isn't trashy. Rivers knows how to imply without needing to write out every little detail. I really liked that the ending was a bit unpredictable too. Fun, light reading."
2,Venoms---Great Fighting/Bad Movie,"As a Venom fan you should still be able to enjoy it simply for the fact that you're a fan. Of all the Venom movies, this one is the poorest though. The dubbing and sound are terrible. I believe a section of the movie is cut at the beginning. Basically, I probably could of lived without seeing this one."
3,IF 5 DEADLY IS A 5 STAR !,"If 5 deadly venoms is a 5 of 5 star rating, this one is a three. Good fights, bad copy(bad tracking at times), voice dubbing was choppy at best. As far as Shaw scripts go this was weak. Good fights though !!"
4,Ignore the critics and buy it!,"With some help from their American friend Robert Berry,Emerson and Palmer came up with a very beautiful and thoroughly satisfying combination of progressive and pop which,contrary to 'critical'opinion,still stands.Together they manage to build awesome soundscapes while remaining accessible.A very decent effort."
3,Three - 'The Power Of Three' (Geffen),"I remember the very day this late '80's pop release hit the stores. Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer had apparently joined up with unknown bassist / vocalist Robert Berry for this one-off 'The Power Of Three' effort. It's decent, certainly no classic but okay. Tracks I liked the best were ""Talkin' About"", ""Desde La Vida"", their Byrd's reworking of ""Eight Miles High"", ""Runaway"" {reminds me a bit of Bon Jovi, uh-oh!} and their somewhat ELP-ish, the well played ""On My Way Home"". Most old school Emerson Lake & Palmer fans should get as much as I did out of this CD."
3,3stars to the power of 3,"Well for completist only, if you do collect every single beeps and bleeps of keith, you better own this cd. I have the japanese edition and as always the packaging is stylish and elegant, another reason that saved this cd from 1 star."
4,Take it for what it is!,"This album, while not a Keith Emerson masterpiece, stands out as an incredible pop album! It has typical 80's production and sheen on the surface, but the songs cover nice ground compared to most of the ""contemporaries"" of that time period. In fact, were it not for Brian Wilson's first solo album being released, I would have called it THE best album of 1988.If you want artistry, go buy Trilogy. If you want progressive, go buy Brain Salad Surgery. If you want to not have to think about it too much, and just enjoy yourself, by all means, buy THIS album.And Emerson Lake and Powell makes a nice complement to this."
4,"3, a very short run.","This is Keith Emerson's 1st band after Emerson Lake and Powell. 3 was short lived, only releasing this ""To The Power Of Three"" #97, in 1988. Along with Emerson on keyboards, he brought along Carl Palmer on drums and American vocalist Robert Berry. The good tunes on this album were, the first single ""Talkin' Bout"" #9 mainstream rock, the poppy ""Lover To Lover"", the progressive ""Desde La Vida"" and their version of The Byrds' ""Eight Miles High"".It never went very far, and it slipped into oblivion after a month or so. Carl went back to Asia, Keith has gotten back on track after several hand problems, and released the great album ""The Keith Emerson Band"" in 2009, and Robert Berry is a jack of all trades in the San Francisco music scene."
3,Bronson vs. Mafia,"The Stone Killer, directed by Michael Winner, starring Charles Bronson as Lt. Torrey, a tough cop who takes no s--- or bullets, in this case Torrey is quicker on the draw or you might say a little trigger happy, never hesitating to eliminate anyone who stands in the way, as it may be the mafia. Martin Balsam is the head honcho inviting all the local mafia dons to a birthday party while Bronson follows the tracks and leads while bullets are flying and bodys are falling. The Stone Killer, isn't lacking in action, just a very confusing plot of who's who and Martin Balsam is not very convincing as a mob boss, probably miscast, Norman Fell, as the police captain does an exceptional acting job, and Charles Bronson is his usual self, this is a Columbia Tri-star VHS, with your normal VHS quality, not remastered, so you get the original old transfer of the film."
2,not bronson's best,"Story not very good and hard to follow.I'm a big Bronson fan. Better movies are the Mechanic, Death Wish, and 10 till midnite."
2,Boring,Boring movie. I can't even remember what the best part was. Bronson's 80's movies are better than this and that's not saying much.
4,CHARLES BRONSON...need I say more?,"It's always a treat to watch a Bronson flick. He was one of a kind. With that being said, this effort by director Michael Winner is solid, but not great. Still,Bronson delivers in his role as a determined cop trying to take on the mob. It was also nice to see the late Norman Fell and a young John Ritter in supporting roles. Based upon the book ""A Complete State of Death"" by John Gardner. If you're a Bronson fan, check this one out! You won't be dissapointed."
2,Not a very useful book,"I don't like this book at all, the authors only writes about keeping the bearded dragons in big outdoor vivariums, and not about having just 1-3 bearded dragons as pets.Very little information about feeding, housing and everything you really want to know. The authors also doesn't seem to think about the bearded dragons as pets, to cuddle with and have fun with, but only as something you can breed.I almonst never read or look in this book, and I regret that I bought it.I rekommend Liz Palikas book ""Your Bearded Dragon's Life"" and the book ""The guide to a owning a BD"" by David Zoffer and Tom Mazorlig instead!"
5,WOW!!,"****** heheI keep looking at this burly, 170 pound iron monster and I can't figure out how Grizzly can sell this unit for such a low price. Its construction is so tough I am able to hammer down metals on its table with no problems. This machine has everything I need, form an encapsulated induction motor to all around sealed-ball bearing construction. Also, the lowest speed setting is good for machining metals. And not to worry, the motor is also quite powerful. The drill chuck does require installation and some adjustment. After installing the chuck I loaded a drill bit and then placed piece of wood on the side of the chuck and tapped it with a hammer until the drill bit spun in perfect center. I hope this review helps...good luck."
5,Great Inexpensive Drill Press,"I am a retired product development engineer and during my career, had use of my company's shop. Now I am putting together a woodworking shop in my garage. This is the first drill press I have owned and I must say, it is a great machine for such a reasonable price. It works like a champ, as well as the drill press in my old company's shop that cost about a thousand dollars.Assembly was easy. It came FedEx Green in a lift gate truck and the driver wheeled it to my garage.I purchased this drill press to see the quality of Grizzly machinery. After using this drill press, I think Grizzly makes a pretty good product. The quality appears better and the item is beefier than the Delta and Jet equivalents I saw at a recent woodworking show. The only complaint is the depth stop is made from pretty thin steel.Based on my experience with the G7944 drill press, a Grizzly band saw, jointer and planer are next on my list of woodworking equipment purchases."
4,Great value,I would have given 5 stars but I was missing the worm gear to adjust the table when it arrived. A quick call to customer service and that had the part out to me in 3 days. For the price you can't beat this drill press. A solid smooth running machine with plenty of power to get the job done. The added light is a blessing and I love the Delta/Jet type depth stop.
2,"Good story, poor formatting","It's a good story, but don't waste your money on the Kindle edition. It's full of formatting errors and whole chunks of the text are actually missing. You'll be in the middle of a scene between two characters, and the next line skips ahead to the following chapter. I gave it one extra star because the book itself is very good and has an entertaining plot, but until a better electronic copy is made, I would stick to the bound editions."
4,Started to cheer me up right away,"This is a must read if you feel like crud after a breakup, can't sleep, can't leave the phone, can't stop thinking about it, etc but are afraid of driving your friends crazy listening to it or afraid they will have you committed to the nuthouse. Read this and half-way through the book you WILL start to feel better - at least enough to get out of bed."
1,Inspirational Reading,"This is a good read. Well thought out and written. An inspirational addition to any Christian library. The scripture is from the Bible, the way it is written, no changes, no additions--just Truth."
2,Won't buy again,"I bought this because it's important for me to use organic products for my two-year old, and I used it too. I thought, you know, baby wash, you can use it for the body and for shampoo. For the body, it's fine. But seriously, it made my scalp dry and itchy. I think it was fine for my daughter's hair. I thought it would be like Johnson and Johnson baby wash, usable for both hair and body.Finally, I just CAN'T STAND the strong smell of the baby wash. I think that's what did it for me. I've grown to hate the strong smell. I bought it because I like lavender, but it's all Tea Tree. Tea tree is just TOO strong, I mean come on, they recommend that you put drops of Tea Tree essential oil in your own homemade cleaning supplies.Ok, that's it. It does clean, does the job, but it smells too strong. I won't buy it again. Maybe, MAYBE, I would try a different scent. But I don't know. Hope this helps."
5,Nuju,"I tend to be a little biased towards Nuju... sure he's breakable, but he was my first ever bionicle and is not one of my favorites, but he is what got me hooked :) im still devastated by the fact that lego killed the bionicle line... it remains to this day my favorite lego series."
3,Not quite deadly,"I consider a good Venom movie one I can to watch over & over again & still not get sick of it(Chinese Super Ninja's,Masked Avengers,). I saw this one once & that was enough. Its a Good venom movie but the plot is sort of confusing. Not enough fight scenes."
5,AWESOME!!,"Was looking for another all natural supplement to help with my anxiety and this is a GREAT calming product! I have little pani attacks here and there and this has alleviated that! I also take a vitamin B complex as well as multi-vitamin. I just took a flight recently and I hate to fly and have full blown panic attacks on flight, I popped one of this and was good to go!! The first 15 mins of the flight the little panic attacks trie to creep in but Inositol kept me nice and calm! Try Ashwaganda as well!"
5,Inositol works,I have been taking Inositol for a few years now for anxiety and OCD.It really has helped and I take L Tneanine with it. Also my daughter has PSOD and it actually made her periods regular.
4,Venom Classic,"I really liked this movie. It had your typical venom plot. You never really know who's the good/bad guy til the end. Good action scences, especially the blade to arm fighting sequences with Golden Arm(that's right he uses his arms to block sword/weapons attacks) . Top Notch Venoms action. I recommend it."
3,its no where neer the best venoms flick,"ok so i seen most of the venoms movies, this one is not a good one, ""invincible shaolin"", ""killer army"" , ""flag of iron"", ""magnificent ruffians"", ""masked avengers"", and ""crippled avengers"" (return of the five deadly venoms) are the best venoms movies available on here with good quality!!! five venoms starts off really good but then is boring after the first ten minutes and the only good thing about kid with the golden arm is philip kwok! (the lizard venom) the film sucks and is boring! only buy it if your a shaw brothers collector!..."
4,Andrew Sherman hits a common sense homer!,"The Complete Guide To Running And Growing Your Business is an excellent resource document for small businesses. If Mr. Sherman had asked me, however, I would have changed the title to ""Very important small business stuff that's hard to find anywhere else, especially written in plain English"". This is the second book I've owned by this author, and knowing that he is an attorney makes me all the more impressed, because he writes about technical and business fundamentals in a way that the average person can understand. If you want to train salespeople or create a website, this ain't the book for that. But if the answers to hundreds of basic business questions that most of us just don't know is what you are looking for, this book won't let you down. I think it will save you some legal fees, too."
5,Top 5 Soundtracks of all-time,"Another early '90's classic soundtrack that was great and matched the feel of the movie. Also this was the coming out party for a man out of Chattanooga, TN named Usher Raymond(Usher) with his hit ""Call Me A Mack""(one of his best songs of all-time) and also featured TLC's remake of the The Time's ""Get It Up"". This soundtrack had some star power to it but was ignored by the mainstream audience which makes this soundtrack underrated. Some other songs of interest as well is ""Indo Smoke"" by Mista Grimm, ""N***** Don't Give A F***"" by the Dogg Pound, & one of my favorite 2Pac joints ""Definition Of A Thug N****"". Overall a great sleeper soundtrack that did not get a lot of pub but in my book it is a classic."
5,The Best Gift,I bought this for my bestfriend's graduation she loves the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. She watches the dvds every night now!!!!
5,Gotta Love Will Smith!,My son just loves these shows! I know it's a tad cheesy but still good to watch with family.
1,Unhappy with this DVD,I have bought a lot of products from Amazon and they are all fantastic and i have been really happy with them the only thing being this DVD which i have bought disks 1 & 2 do not work along with disk 4 constantly skipping. Not happy with this purchase however overall very happy with amazon
3,not as funny as the previous seasons,"It seems that as tv comedies progress, they get smutty and cliche. This is an example, but I know other people still find it okay. The first disk didn't play so I missed that one. We only watched a few of the second disk.I contacted the seller and he graciously returned my money promptly."
4,The End has Finally Come for Stephanie!,"Wow, the end has come because this is the last book in the rather long Full House series. In this book Stephanie has finally found true love in Italy on a school trip. Corey has liked her since the beginning but never told Stephanie because to her he was obnoxious about his film making abilities and fight about everything but I'll leave the rest up to you, the readers to read about. I thought the book was great though for once not focused so much on the flamingo feud and some of Stephanie's friends are missing."
1,Disgusting.,"I am a 12 year old girl, and I thought this book had a little too much romance for me.I totally don't recommend it for any age 13 and under.It is very well written, but just a little too old for me."
4,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,"""Binyag"" means Baptism - according to my Tagalog-English dictionary. Why do I have to look it up? Because this film, a lot like many other Filipino Gay movies, tend to forget that many of us don't speak Tagolog. So, again, I have to give this review on a viewing-only basis. The cover and back of this DVD has English discription for the movie but NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES are available. Ebony Productions should make subtitles for future DVDs. Storyline seems a bit slow and dragging - but the beauty of the main character and the beaches are breathtaking. The female character in this movie seems to be out-of-place and quite frankly - not necessary. 3 stars for the guy and beach scenery (which they could have shown more of), while 1 star for the plot. Also this DVD has a nice Photo-gallery as a Special Feature."
1,No subtitles...,".... I will buy this Film when it has English subtitles..... I don't understand Tagalog. sorry. I am interested in seeing the movie, but I want to know what is going on (audibly)."
4,Neon Genesis,"This is a great series, full of suspense that is one of the most controversial manga/anime's in Japan and the US. It has a great plot and is definitly worth the money. You always want to know what happends next. The main characters: The mysterious Rei Ayanami, The quiet Shinji Ikari, and Misato. The DVD is also good, because it is subtitled and you can compare what they say in japanese and English. I would definitly reccommend it to any anime fan. It is a mecha type anime and not so much in the way of love. Has alot of action and some disturbing images later on in the series. (Don't worry not as many as most anime) But overall good, but the ending is really bad."
5,Different. Very different from the last one.,"Okay, I hope you didnt get to comfy with the first disc because this ones different. First off, the previews are at the beggining of the DVD (just like Gasaraki). Plus, for all those who hate replacing the Kanji with subtitles, yours prayers have been answered. The original Kanji is back with subtitles. For some, this is good, but for me, its not. The only reason I gave this DVD 5 stars is because the subtitles are easier to read now. That, and the fact that I can still watch my favorite anime in Spanish and French. Bio include Rei, Gendo, Kaji, Auska, Angel 5 and Angel 6. This new DVD will make those familiar with the VHS version feel right at home. And the episodes? Seeing that little fashing moment on the ship in episode 8 was the most hilarious gag I have ever seen in Evangelion. Definetely get this DVD for sure."
3,Does many jobs cheaply (if not necessarily accurately),"I'm sorry to see everyone trashing this piece of equipment. I've had mine for a year and keep finding more ways to use it. I got it for the versatility (telescoping & rotating). Of course it is underpowered, vibrates too much and is only marginally accurate, but you can respect it for what it is, a cheap but versatile tool that doesn't take over a small shop. I don't regret my purchase in the least, but I knew what I was getting into. Go ahead, spend $600 on the Delta; it will do one thing really well. If you're not too fussy and just want to get a hole drilled just about anywhere, consider a radial drill press."
1,"Poor Product, Poor Service",Generally poorly made and inaccurate. The customer service is even worse.
5,Birthday fun,I purchased this for my granddaughters 2nd birthday and she loves the book. We read it over and over and over.
2,Problem with the printing of the book,"I have no problem with the book/story itself. The reason I gave such a low rating is that the cover of the book and pages were not bound properly. When you open the book, the pages are upside down. I ended up just taking the paper cover and turning the book around so that it would open properly. I didn't want to have to go through the trouble of returning it and getting a new one.In these digital days, you would think book publishers would ensure their products are correctly made. I spent over $10 so I could get it in a hard cover so my child could cherish it forever, but instead I got a defective product."
5,Birthday Book,"I bought this book for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. It was monkey-themed, and I had the guests sign it as they came in. Great price for a great book!"
5,Another charming Curious George story,"This story follows the same story arch of all the others: Man with the yellow hat leaves George alone (will he never learn?), George inadvertently creates a disaster, and all works out in the end. My four year old loves Curious George and enjoyed a story with a birthday theme."
4,Birthday,"My daughter loves this story and she would like to have all of the George books. However, in this story I was a bit surprised when George invited a pack of dogs into the kitchen to lick it clean!"
4,Cute,A great little book that my son enjoyed receiving for his birthday. It's a much loved book that already shows many signs of wear.
1,False Advertisement,The picture shoes the coach carriage which is not the same as the coach hideout that you receive. The product that you receive is just something to place in the hamster cage for them to sit not the actually carriage that the picture shows.
3,Not all products ordered function properly,"I ordered 12 sets of battery-operated lights. One of the sets does not work at all. I have tried multiple sets of batteries, but it still does not work. Due to the event for which these were purchased, there was no time to return these and ask for a replacement. I would suggest, in the future, having something that plainly states on the package that the product has been tested and functions properly. The package arrived in great shape and I do NOT believe that the malfunction was due to shipping damage."
3,LIGHT SET,SOME WERE DEFECTIVE. DON'T BUY THESE IF YOU NEED TO USE THEM RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO SEND SOME BACK.
1,POOR QUALITY,"I received this item, loaded the betteries in it and within 2 hours, the batteries were dead.It became very hot. I threw it out and will look elsewhere for a better quality set."
2,Work but flimsy,"I was wary after reading reviews of these lights. Sure enough, a wire from the battery pack was broken and had to be soldered but after the repair they worked and worked well through the holidays. Used them on a wreath on our entry door so the conditions weren't the best for any light set."
3,"TAKES ""AA"" BATTERIES, NOT ""C"" BATTERIES","All lights worked. Product worked well...when I got AA batteries, not C batteries as told in the product description. (word)"
4,Pretty good taste and better than most junk food,The chips taste pretty good but lack a little in the crunch department. The nutrition profile and ingrdients are much better than most name-brand nacho chips. I didn't really taste too much jalapeno. Next time I'll try another flavor.
1,WORST taste - Don't waste your money!!!,"These are the WORST snack ever. they taste more like DIRT than the wheat and oat bran they should be. I think they must be stale! I want a refund of my money but they ""are not eligible for return"" according to the amazon. - Don't waste your money buying these."
1,Lacks expression,"I was so excited about getting this CD, as my grandaughters love the Berenstain Bear stories. I planned to use it on long drives in the car with them. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of expression of Mama Bear. I hate to be rude, but I think my five year old grandaughter could read with more expression. Papa Bear was fine. He ""felt"" the lines he was reading, but Mama Bear didn't feel her part and was not convincing. Lines were staggered and delayed. In fact, I am about to write Amazon to see if I can return the CD. I realize that the voices are the authors themselves, but I wish they had gotten the same voices that are on the DVD's."
2,speaking voices are difficult to hear,"the music and other sound effects were too loud and makes it difficult to hear the story, which is too bad and frustrating"
1,Difficult to understand,I do not recommend this audiobook. The narrators are unimaginative and the background music is too loud. My daughter loves audiobooks but doesn't even get through one of these stories before losing interest. The audiobook Lilly and the Plastic Purse collection is by far her favorite. The difference between the narration of Berenstain and Lilly is remarkable.
2,very disappointed,"voices reading stories are difficult to understand, poor annunciation. female voice is grinding on adult ears."
2,annoying and poorly recorded.,The background music is an annoying tanbourine and flute that never changes and becomes way too loud in between narrations. The voices are too deep and soft (his) and too grating and plastic (hers) - you certainly cannot picture the caracters from listening to them.The stories certainly are great but the narration is a great disappointment.
3,B Bears,"I like that there are quite a few stories in this set. The voices of the narrators left a little to be desired - according to my 6 and 2 year old. They wanted the same voices as are on the videos/cartoons. My 2 year old listened longer than my 6 year old. I do take it in the car, and they listen to it for about 2 stories, and are ready for something else. Overall, an ok purchase."
2,Piece of Junk,I bought this and I was like wow i can make good milkshakes but I was wrong. I bought it and the milkshakes tasted horrible and the maker is really just a spinning thing you should just get a spoon and cup and mix it. The plastic was durable though and the educational value only teaches you how to measure. Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A Comprehensive History of Women's Self-Image through Time,"This book was amazing! It is easy to read and so informative. It covers women from the Victorian age up to modern time using case studies to show the changing views about their bodies. I reccomend this book to young girls, teens, and mothers. A wonderful work!"
2,Not nearly as good as I had expected,"i picked up this book excited to read it. i thought it would be as informative and interesting as naomi wolf's ""promiscuities."" but it was not. i found the book to be boring. as a feminist and a women's studies major, this book offered me no new insight and it simply was not provocitive. if you are looking for a good contemporary feminist read, try something by namoi wolf or susan fauldi."
2,A disappointment,"I wish I had taken the advice of one reviewer who said ""save your money"". This is not a history of women and the implements of torture they routinely accept to ""look better"", which is what I thought I would get - it was a rant about how horrible society is for girls now compared to Victorian days. I'm 66 years old and I'm tired of hearing about how much worse things are now. Being a female has never been easy (I don't think being male is either), just because things are different doesn't make them worse. Come on. Unless a woman has lived as female, then and now, how does she know how they compare? If you're looking for the history of bras, girdles, sanitary napkins and birth control through time, look elsewhere and ""save your money""."
5,"Amazing, with right on insight!","I am a young woman of nine-teen years who thought this was an amazing book. Brumberg did a marvelous job of being objective and unbiased. Media's transformation over the years was most interesting (that showing ankles used to be shocking). This book was so right on. It told of how in the Victorian age how virginity was so esteemed and how society cherished and tried so hard to protect their teenage girls' sexuality and virginity. It also tells how girls' bodies are maturing at an earlier age than in the past. There is so much information given in a way that will make you think and come up with your own conclusions about the topic. She doesn't just spell it out for you. You have to read it for yourself to see what a marvel it is. This is not only a book for girls but for guys, for parents, for anyone..it will really puts alot of things together for you...it will turn your light bulb on for sure."
3,Okay,"This book is just okay. It tells mostly about menstrual attitudes of the past, but it is not very interesting or extensive."
2,Unfulfilled Potential,"The Body Project does shed some insight into a narrow group of American girls, primarily focusing on how life has evolved over the past 2 centuries for white, middle class adolescents. It is now, itself, though, a dated book. Internet and media's impact on ""Our Girls"" have left this book in the dust. While it still may be read for Brumberg's personal perspective into the transformation out of the Victorian mentality, and through the sexual and feminism movements of the 1900's, the book is neither objective nor very relelvent to our country's diverse cultural makeup today. Unfortunately, from the time I read the title, through each chapter subtitle, I was left with unfulfilled expecations. Nevertheless, I am happy to at least walk away with interesting tidbits on commercialization of menstrual products, bras, and even the historical preoccupation with hymens."
3,I enjoyed this book,"I thought that it was very interesting to see how the perspective on girls and women has changed over the last century and a half. There is a price to be paid for gaining personal liberty. The book expresses the idea that the lack of organizations and female mentors has contributed to many of the problems or girls today.I have been reading some of the reviews of others here, and some people seem to be taking an overly harsh view of this book in some cases. Although it may not be the end all to end all on the topic of girls and their issues, this book is certainly worth reading and is not a waste of time.Also, someone made a comment about the book associating body piercing with homosexuality - I didn't notice that at all."
1,Another ' feminist' pushing her own agenda.,"Voyeuristic approach to female adolesence. Not even in the same league as 'Reviving Ophelia'. She draws grossly inadequate conclusions about sexuality based on quotes from Seventeen magazine! The title suggests it's all about body image; it's not. She leaps into her opinions about sexuality, loss of virginity, lesbianism, etc. and presents it as fact. Obviously has her agenda. Her sources of information are laughable. Historical information about undergarments; bras, sanitary pads, etc. is mildly interesting. Save your money."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Ths book was boring to me. Too much history, not enough of current way of the western culture. It is really dating itself. I wasn't too interested, I never finished it."
4,The Body Project,"The book is well written, informative, and interesting. Unfortunately, written in the mid-1990s and not updated, some of the examples are a little dated or not following current trends. That said, the larger historical content and significance makes for an interesting read."
2,I felt ripped off buying this book.,"I needed some concrete advice on how to handle complaint more effectively. This book didn't really tell me much more than to be obnoxious in demanding what you want. While the squeaky wheel gets the oil, why be obnoxious to a low level representative of the company? If you don't like how you are being treated, take your business and money elsewhere. This book just taught how to be a whiny, obnoxious customer, until the company caves in and you get what you want. How about some constructive advice instead?"
4,This book is a calling for consumers to fight back.,"This is a book that gives advice to consumers on how to take action against the bad service and lack of quality in our economy. It's a cry for consumers to stop being sheep and start being tigers. It is a how-to-guide for consumers to start to fight back. Overall, it was an interesting book that was easy to read and understand. The authors use good examples to get their points across to the consumer. Although one aspect regarding the examples used, too many become repetitive and boring."
4,Happy Story about adoption,"This is a happy book that is beautifully, colorfully, and imaginiatively illustrated. It tells the story of what seems mostly like a domestic adoption very nicely. Some of the humor of the book is geared toward adults more than the children that it would be read to. I am a single mom of more than one child, so I will say that the book portrays the adoption of a child into a family consisting of a mom and dad and no other siblings are mentioned. However, my children enjoy this book a lot and I always appreciate any story that helps tell about different kinds of families and the way they are formed. This book does that well and I would recommend it."
3,Ok book for adopted child,"Again, this book seems more as an out of state/country adoption. Graphics are great in the book. Cute book"
1,Well-intentioned but misses the mark,"This book may appeal to adoptive parents, but it ""glosses over"" the feelings of abandonment and loss which are part of every adoptee's experience, even at a very young age. This book would not be appropriate in a family where there are both natural and adopted siblings, since it doesn't deal with the common belief that adoption is ""second best"" to having a child of one's own. Ms. Curtis deserves credit for trying to write about this complex subject from a child's perspective, but by ignoring the negative aspects of adoption, she's missed the mark."
1,Surprise.. surprise.,"I was taken by surprise by the subject matter of the book. I was not aware the book was about an adopted child.I wanted to give it as part of a Christmas gift for my grandchild who lives out of state, but only read it when it arrived for shipment to her. Im really glad I read thru the book because it would have been totally inappropriate and confusing to the child. Under normal circumstances, this would be an ideal book for an adopted child to read. Sorry."
1,Come on!,"This is so ridiculous. Do we think that children are idiots? Obviously the author has little or no insight into the experience of children. What did she write this while rehearsing her strip tease for TRUE LIES? Perhaps her nanny ghost wrote it. This book infantalizes infants and gives a ""cutesy"", nauseating response to questions that are really more complex. I think this book says more about the level of development of the author than it does about how to talk to children about important issues. Please get serious about children. They are not all as stupid as the ones that this book was written for."
4,Tell Me Again About...,"Awesome! I love the stor, and it has been a great intro for family, cousins and friends that are not sure how to address our newly adopted infant. We have been able to take the lead in how we tell, share and react to the situation as he grows.Love Jamie Lee Curtis, the story is wonderful, loving and makes the subject of adoption OK. Artwork is fun, and any child will enjoy reading this story, and learning about adoption...Thank you for putting it out there"
4,"Please mum, tell me again, and again, and again....","We all know children love to hear their favorite stories read to them over, and over, and over again. This is the probably the most requested and most important story of all - how and where was I born! Jamie Lee Curtis's book is a lovely introduction to the birth story - and although it is a little American centred - it is a great book for children of all adoptive lands. Highly recommended.Michelle Dennis, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"
5,Adoption,"I love this book. It was recommended to us by our adoption agency. I am hoping it will help explain adoption to my 6 month old. She is too young to understand yet, but I read the book to her often. She loves the bright colors!! I haven't seen a sweeter story about adoption for children....I get choked up everytime we read it!!!"
5,Great Domestic Adoption Book - My Adopted Daughter Loves It!,"This is pretty much how our story happened, so we love it! My daughter is 5 and loves every ounce of it. She asked me to read it to her again last night. More than anything it makes her feel so special and uniquely chosen. The only part I disagree with is I think football is the greatest sport, not baseball. :)"
2,Convoluted,"I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter. I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth). Sorry, not a fan. We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults."
1,Too specific,"This wasn't the book for us. It is way too specific. If your baby's birth mom wasn't a young girl, or if you didn't get the call after the baby was born and then flew to the location, and saw the baby for the first time thru the nursery window, then this isn't the book for you. We love the books, God found us You and A mother for Choco."
1,Parent centered,This book's message is about the parent experience and not that of the child. A children's book about adoption should be based on the child's perspective and their experiences.
4,"Not Our Story, But A Nice Story","My wife and I have adopted two girls from China so stories about adoption are important to us. Although Curtis' book is about a domestic adoption, I think it is important to show our girls the many ways families are formed. Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born is a cute story about a young girl who asks her parents about the first night of her life. There are many details she wants to know. Was she tiny and perfect? How did her parents feel the first time they held her? What was the lullaby that mommy sang as they fell asleep? I especially like how the father plays as much of a role in the story as the mother. Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born is a fun story that celebrates the beautiful blessing of adoption."
4,Wonderful book for both new adoptive parents and adoptees,I found this book many years ago and picked it up for myself. I was adopted when I was 5 and am very fortunate. This book really does show how special are adoptive children. I've since bought about 6 copies (also had to replace the one my dog ate!). I've used it as a gift to various friends who have adopted as a way to share the adoption story with their child so that they knew how very special they are.
3,For domestic adoptees only,I rated three stars because although the book is well written and illustrated it has a very narrow focus. I bought this looking for books to begin to introduce adoption to my 3 1/2 year old - adopted from Ethiopia at 8 months. It was recommended for adopted kids. Well it is a good book but really not at all appropriate for international adoptees - who are often adopted older and MUCH of the story is not at all like their story. The story is very specific to the domestic adopt at/near birth scenario. So for those parents it is a real winner - but not for us. A more general book like The Day We Met You by Phoebe Koehler is appropriate for domestic or international kids adopted as infants but not necessarily at birth.
3,Where are all songs?,"I'm agree with the previus review. But there is a explication: the music that Vocalion launch on the reissue is axactly as appear for European market, by Decca. For us, in America, London made some different covers and different songs. It's a pity that 3 songs were ""killed"". And where are the ""bonus tracks""? I suppose that they have (in the master tapes made in England) all the songs."
3,One of Durrells animal collecting exhibitions.,A journey to west africa to collect endangered species for his zoo in Jersey where he preserved animals against extinction. Durrell funded his zoo greatly with his writing. This is one of his books describing the trials and tribulations of finding and catching animals in the wild. A good read for what it is.
4,Great customer service,This company has great customer service and responds very quickly to make every order perfect for the purchaser.
1,Es un muy buen Anime,"Es bastante comico, incluye comportamientos de Mazinger adaptados a los personajes de Cutey Honey, no podria ser mas que por Go Nagai.Es bastante divertido"
1,Don't like it!,I'm having a hard time even watching this Anime! I've watched 2 episodes (I think) and then put the DVD back in the box. I'd rather watch Bert and Earnie!
3,Cutey Honey-Essential Anime Collection (Vol.1 & 20d,"Cutey Honey - Essential Anime Collection (Vols. 1 & 2) Cutey Honey is a cute, fun and sexy series. I have always enjoyed this series and had to include it in my anime collection. If you love good anime give Cutey Honey a Holla. Definitely not time wasted."
5,Honey Flash!,"This collection is the better alternative to buying the more expensive single discs separately. I love Cutey Honey. I had the original VHS tapes years ago and was glad that a collection of the eight episodes had finally been released. The extras on the DVDs include cosplay performances and interviews with the voice actresses.Sadly the number of episodes belies an unfinished work. I have a feeling Go Nagai wanted a continuing series, but never got around to making it so. Still, for all fans of Cutey Honey this is a must-buy collection."
2,Meh.,"Sort of like Speed Racer level of animation, with soft, soft core nudity.Okay, a little better than Speed Racer.Never even heard of Cutey Honey before Amazon.com kept recommending it to me, so maybe I don't know how to enjoy this properly. Like a well-aged bad red wine."
2,"Pictured product is Misleading, Not as advertised","When I did research on this light it's always pictured with ""barn doors"" attached. The other options and accessories are clearly described as to what is included and what is not. The Pro Light is shown with barn doors attached and I assumed it to be part of the product. Shame on you! Also, since this product has been offered since 2003, you state nobody has rated or reviewed this light? No reviews in six years? Shame on you! { :^("
2,"Uhh, a little off the edges","Not the greatest bionicle, its not nearly as good as the originals. I wouldn't buy it if I were you unless you were combinding pieces."
5,A wondrous memoir!,"I couldn't put this book down! Everyone will find something in this book to make them laugh or bring them to tears or both at the same time. Rita grew up in a place where she must have stood out somewhat like a sore thumb. Not only was she black but she was smart and clever and could do everything the other kids could do, without the advantages. She KNEW how to get through life and come out the winner. And as a resident of Colorado, to find it described with so much tenderness and beauty was an extra treat. I enjoyed this book more than any other I have read in many a year. I didn't want it to end and Rita, if you're out there, I'll be waiting for the next one. There is still so much I want to know about you and your family."
4,Laughed out loud,"What I loved about this book was the message but also the humor! Especially when some parts of the story are very sad, the humorous point of view was a saving grace."
2,Dreary and tedious... I couldn't wait to put it down!,"Ugh... another whiny memoir about a dysfunctional family. I would not have finished this book had it not been for my book club.The author, instead of understanding the hardship of taking on a child that is not yours, constantly blames her aunt for all the horrible things in her life. Perhaps she should have blamed her father who completely abandoned her? Or perhaps she should have look at her Aunt Daisy as someone who literally worked her fingers to the bone to put the author into the best schools she could.Is the reader really supposed to feel for the author when her Aunt Daisy has to take livestock and kill it for food? Or how about when she is able to take lessons at a private dance camp because she helps clean? I had to clean a hair salon every Saturday for four weeks to get a free haircut, should I write a memoir?"
4,Bravo to Rita!,"I have passed this book on to my 14 year old daughter. It is a ""coming of age"" book that she'll enjoy. It's a glimpse into a frigid world of poverty and resentment, knitted with redemption and spirit. Bravo to Rita!"
4,Waiting for More!,"I loved her story, I couldn't keep away. Only one problem, it ended way to soon. There were so many parts of her life that I can relate to, and the way she handled them were so inspiring."
4,An African American childhood in Colorado,"I had not heard of this author and picked the book up on a whim. If you like stories of the West, it is fascinating! Reading about Aunt Daisy opens a door to the lives of so many pioneers who were not white and were not written about, and all that they survived. I just wish Rita had included what happened to her Aunt. I want to know more."
2,incomplete,"the item itself is fine, but it came without matching screws. for the price, and considering its a specialized item, screws should be included."
1,Shame on production company!,"I am an avid aerobics girl, and the angles on this video are horrible. The routine itself is not easy to learn, and the camera angles make it even MORE challenging to learn! They keep panning in on her footwork, then her arms, they need to just stay on her whole body for us to be able to follow! I got dizzy watching it. On a positive note, her routine is awesome if you can learn it...learning it is the REAL challenge."
4,Works as advertised,Received product very quickly and the product worked great. Would order it again. Small problem - the tube leaked at the bottom.
5,Just what I needed,"I had been spraying my garage door mechanism with teflon lube but realized that it had originally been greased, so got this product and smeared it on. Much quieter operation! It's messy to apply but worth the effort, use it every few months."
3,Thats the whey,"Not much to rate here really just a necessary lubricate for the garage opener gears, not sure it has to be low temp for south Florida but thats the whey it comes. Make sure you completely coat each tooth of the sprocket gears."
4,Better than the rating folks. And the album is worth getting.,"As opposed to this over-priced single (the album is 10.97 right now, way cheaper than this rip-off single, which the three tracks are ON the album. Don't be fooled; Amazon does this type of thing ALL the time!!!Spoiled (5/5) Solid, solid ballad.Less Is More (3.75) Nice, could've been better!Don't Know How (4/5) The production, the instruments, the lyrics; everything is very good.A very good single, however, I would have thrown in the mid-tempo ballad, Jet Lag to make it way, WAY better.Cover Art: BInside Art: ?Songwriting: BVocals: A-Vocal Emotion: B+Production: B-4.25 stars.Overall: B-"
3,A little decline here. ***1/2.,"""Astra"" (1985) #67.Third studio release, John Wetton rejoins the band, but Steve Howe leaves and Mandy Meyer (Krokus) fills in. This isn't a bad record (far from it), but we get some weak tracks for the first time, ""Wishing"", ""Love Now Till Eternity"" and ""Suspicion"". ""Go"" #46 hot 100 and #7 MSR was the lead single, it sounded good back in '85, but has gotten a little stale now days. ""Hard On Me"" and ""Too Late"" #30 MSR, are two songs that should of been top 40 hits! ""Voice Of America"", and ""Rock N'Roll Dream"" are excellent songs. I just find some of the 80's mechanical sound a little distracting. Nothing new until 1990."
5,Astra Review,I had this DVD before only lost it due to a B&E. It's great to have the music back again. I listen to it almost constantly. I'll probably wear it out.
3,"Weak, but not horrible","This is indeed the weakest of the three Asia albums. Mandy Meyer tries, but is basically at best an acceptable heavy metal player, and has nowhere near the resonance of Steve Howe. The highlights are at the beginning; ""Go"", ""Hard On Me"" and ""Rock and Roll Dream"" are solid, enjoyable numbers. ""Wishing"" is melodic if a bit sappy. The second side falters, although ""Suspicion"" has a fairly decent heavy metal climax. But this album has two stars knocked off for ""Love Now Till Eternity"", a truly awful song that even the mandolin at the end can't save. John Wetton and Geoff Downes were trying VERY hard to hit an AOR market here and they fall completely flat. This was the end of Asia for a while until ""Then & Now"" and the... incredibly unfortunate restructuring with John Payne."
2,AFTER THE WAR...,"AFter the ""pop-opera"" ALPHA, Steve Howe (who contributed not a single song for it) went away. In came Mandy Meyer (who??), a respectable guitarrist with a lot of edge to his playing, but caught in the middle of Asia's worst album till date, when Weton and Downes struggled hard to write pop songs who could mantain their sales above the platinum status!! So, all spontainety was gone, and the result was an album with a handful of great songs (GO, VOICE OF AMERICA and the best, ROCK AND ROLL DREAM), but all of them going towards unashamed pop-glam-hair-American-AOR music (Ufa!!). The logical conclusion was that the band closed operations after this thud."
4,THEIR rock and roll dream!,"I love asia and although this isn't as good as ALPHA it is better than the self-titled album. the best tracks are rock and roll dream (excellent solo by Steve Howe) wishing and too late, too late is a lot like the UK stuff. go buy this album if you like alpha ( i have reviewed that ) and UK danger money (that is my nickname)."
2,The Third is A Turd,"Asia mispelled the title of this album, omitting the second ""s"" in ASStra. That's what this album sounds like. After the first two records, this album should not have even reached the streets. Voice of America is an awful song, as is Rock n Roll Dream! Okay, John Wetton has never been one for imaginative lyrics, but the songs on this album bring him down further. I think that, had the band waited a year or two and really focused on this album, it would've been a lot better. ""Hard On Me"" is a great song. Pure pop, it should've been a big hit. But, I mean, what is Countdown to Zero, or Suspicion? Go was a lame attempt at mimicing Van Halen's Jump. Carl even says so in his book Applied Rhythms, released by Modern Drummer press. I lost interest in Asia after this album. To complete the scatological theme for this review, the so-called explosions on After the War sound like toilets flushing."
2,"No Howe,......No how.........An Alright Asia Album","After being spoiled by ""Asia"" and ""Alpha"", ""Astra"" really pales by comparison. The glaring absence of Steve Howe is virtually devastating to the effort as a whole. The overwrought, cheesy synth-driven tunes, as good as some of them are, could have been dramatically improved with the addition of Mr. Howe's guitar wizardry. I realize he was out of the group by this time, but you'd have thought they would have at least attempted to duplicate his sound here and there. That being said, there are some good songs here and overall it's worth a listen to. I'm pretty pumped to hear their new cd ""Phoenix"". The samples I've heard so far are promising. Here's hoping Steve Howe gets his due on the new album and returns Asia to the original sound that made them a household name in 1982!!"
2,GOing mainstream!,"ASTRA is nothing more than ASIA going totally mainstream, losing all the force of their magical debut, ASIA.Of course, all the musicians involved here are highly talented and we have some few decent tunes. But the overall sound is clearly commercial, too polished, too mellow (the worst examples being ""Too Late"" and ""SUspicion""). It seems they were written by a pop metal band.Also, with the exit of Steve Howe, keyboards here are more predominant than ever, suffocating the guitar.It's not a great album, no way. But the tunes are so commercial that you can listen to it wihtou being ""hurt"" by it.."
3,An acquired taste,"Like fine wine, it took a while for Astra to grow on me. While I still considered it the weakest of the group's first three releases, songs like ""Rock and Roll Dream"" and ""Go"" rank up there with Asia's best. Mandy Meyer ably fills Steve Howe's shoes, though Geoff Downes' keyboard-heavy production tends to overwhelm the guitar and bass lines. Overall, a decent effort that deserved more support from the label. (A tour would have helped, too!)"
3,Astra Not Astronomical,"After two great albums, number three for Asia is not quite the charm. This album definitely shows the turmoil the group recently suffered with the departure and return of John Wetton along with Steve Howe leaving. Mandy Meyer does a good job at replacing the progressive rock master, but the results are mixed.Overall, Astra is littered with good songs, a few great and some not so great. Go is an obvious take off on Van Halen's Jump, but very good nonetheless. I've found new meaning with Voice of America after 9/11. The other highlights are Love Now Til Eternity, Hard On Me and the epic Rock and Roll Dream. The album falls short with filler like Suspicion and After The War. It's not that the songs are bad, but the former is boring and the latter is not Asia.It's too bad the group never found glory with John Wetton again. He's a great singer, but John Payne has done a great job filling his shoes."
2,Nothing to see hear so move on,"If only you could judge a record by its cover. If that was the case this would be a good record, but unfortunately it isn't. The first thing that becomes apparent to the listener is the new guitar sound. I'm sorry but it just doesn't fit in. Steve Howe's guitar work was perfect for Asia. But the new guitarist (sorry, I can't remember his name and is it even important) just doesn't have the same warmth and feel in his playing like Howe. What's worse is the lyrics sound forced and the song writing is just plane lousy. All of the bombastic chords and calm interludes are present on the record but without any good melodies the songs just don't go anywhere. If you continue to listen to the entire cd without hitting the skip button once, besides performing a miracle, you will continue to sit on the edge of your seat hoping for Asia to redeem themselves yet they never do. If you are a big Asia fan I would say give it a try. You may like it. But don't let your hopes up."
3,Asia: a Rock and Roll Dream,"This is the hard rock album of the John Wetton era of Asia. Mandy Meyer had replaced Steve Howe as guitarist and brought with him a heavy metal feel replacing the classic guitar style of Howe. Geoff Downe's keyboards are more predominant than ever and the album is ""more produced"" than the other Wetton era albums. This album's theme is ""good bye"" whether it's through the obvious ""Armageddon"" theme or the end of a ""Rock and Roll Dream"" (Asia's most underrated song and an epic rock story)as the band pretty much withered away, at least temporarily, as did the record label's support of the album. ""Voice of America"" is the best ballad on the album."
4,Asia&#65533;s best album,"On the band's third album... and last ""real"" album if you ask me... the musicians really add something to their futuristic rock well-known from the first two albums.Take e.g. the gloomy arrangement of Countdown To Zero, or the nearly rhapsodic Voice Of America which is probably Asia's biggest hit ever. My personal favourite Asia song of all times is the closing track After The War in which the arrangement combining rock and orchestral instruments creates a true symbiosis with the theme of the song.This is the best album Asia has released and will ever release. Today, the line-up is almost completely changed, and believe me: not for the better!"
3,Popular Alternative or Alternative Pop?,"This latest effort by Brian Leach and cohorts (all named Brian) is more of what you always liked about Brian's music - a little off the beaten path without that streak of gratuitous angst that pervades the alternative scene. I personally liked ""Three Mil Thick"" (the first Sugarbuzz CD) a little better, but ""Submerged"" is a good disc and a sound investment in a talented group of guys."
5,A boy's challenging path to manhood.,A well written and insightful story of a boy's overwhelming challenges to reach adulthood. I was hooked from the first paragraph. I found it to be an interesting and well written story. It was inspiring as well as interesting.
2,Be aaware...this is the Lens ONLY!!,"Don't be fooled like me. Despite the picture showing the light and the lens, this is for the LENS ONLY. My bad...I didn't read the description thoroughly enough."

4,Dark Crisis review by master duelist Hunter R,"Dark Crisis is a great pack for experienced duelists (like me), Dark Crisis has some of the best cards in the game,(Judgement of Anubis,Blast held by a tribute,Reflect Bounder,Vampire Lord),and many more. It is not hard to get those cards I listed for I have every last holo and rare in DArk Crisis.If you love Yu-Gi-Oh like me and are experienced as me then I suggest you get your hands on some Dark Crisis packs quick before they stop printing the first edition cards and go to the unlimited set."
3,Jon,"This pack is not the best if you duel with yu-gi-oh.If you just collect yu-gi-oh cards, this pack is good for you.(The best card that I got was a contract with exodia and it wasn't even the rare card."
2,OK Game,"Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too."
3,yugioh isnt out yet...,"many people claim yugioh is over but it is not, large amounts of new boosters and decks are coming out and as for the tv series a new one call gx is also coming soon. the old boosters still have many good cards in but the new ones are much better and so far from what i hav viewed card such as cyber end dragon and gilford the lightning are going to make the game much more exciting. yugioh is not over (yet) and from the way the company is making the cards and a new series, it seems they are obsessed to make the game last."
3,Nick D's review of Dark Crisis Yu-gi-oh TCG packs,"Yu-gi-oh is a fun TCG. It has intresting cards and effects, especially Dark Crisis! Dark Crisis is one of the most unique and powerful packs that has came out. If you specialize in Special Summons and powerful effects you'll love Dark Crisis! It also has pretty good power attackers like Archfiend Soldier, the most powerful Level 4 monster in the game. You should also look for cards like Shinato,King of a Higher Plane(Ritual Monster), Cost Down(Spell Card), Vampire Lord!!( Secret rare!), Reflect Bounder!!(monster) and D.D. Warrior Lady(monster). I rate the following packs from best to worst like so: 1)Metal Raiders 2)Legend of BEWD 3)Legacy of Darkness 4)Ancient Sanctuary 5)Invasion of Chaos 6)Dark Crisis 7)Pharoahs Servent 8)Labrynth of Nightmare 9)Magician's Force 10)Soul of the Duelist 11)Magic Ruler 12) Pharoanic Gaurdian."
5,"TWO THUMBS, ABOVE MY HEAD","This cd fly , fly , fly, way above the sky...every song on this cd rocks, jimmie is a commercial and progressive version of his brother(stevie ray vaughan) he experiment with a little bit of jazz,rock, blues and a little bit of soul...like ""sweet soul vibe"" but my favorite is ""two wings"" it has a churchy gospel beat to it that'll have your feet stomping. I first bought it in cassette ten years ago until the cassette player chewed it up, I tried to look for it but it was hard to find, and then I found it on amazon.com thank you amazon , because this is one of my favorite over all cd's and I won't have to look no further for other cd's by jimmie vaughan just go straight to the source....AMAZON"
5,"beauty, simplicity and six strings","the absence and pain can lead to the beauty ...this can be felt through this songs ...sweet soul vibe, tilt a whirl, six strings down...strange pleasure...threading memories with blues and soul...deep respect, gentle joy emerge from the music spilled here...please ... listen it... become a gift to yourself!!!"
4,Good cover...,Cover fit snugly over my fire pit with an elastic bottom/opening to keep it on in windy days. Material seems fairly thick and looks like it should last.
2,Not what we expected,We bought this book to work through each day of Advent - not at all what we thought. The wording is confusing and the application isn't clear or practical. Wouldn't recommend it.
5,Thought provoking and inspiring,"Advent and Christmas Wisdom is a fitting title for this work. Nouwen offers a meaningful exploration of faith in the context of daily life. He is not speaking from the mountain top, but from the trenches. The selected readings are brief enough to fit my crazy schedule and deep enough to keep me coming back for more."
1,Impossible to get off,"I bought this nail polish because it advertised as a natural product. Well, it's impossible to get off. The only way to get it off is to buy Their own polish remover which costs $12.00! And then it takes 1/2 hr. to remove!!!!"
2,Magnetic pull alarm,"the magnetic part was great however, the alarm sounds like a cell phone ringing so the care givers were slow to respond."
1,glammers,The reason this product is difficult to find is because Almay discontinued manufacturing ALL their creams in 2005. I contacted Almay to purchase an anti-aging product and was told the product was 7 years old!
3,Need more than one,"It did well with jeans, but not with shorts. It's much more pleasant than a spray. Be sure to keep it in a sealed bag so it doesn't lose it's effect. I would suggest one for each wrist in really buggy areas."
2,one of a string of British spy/adventure shows...and not the best,"In the very small subgenre of mystery series revolving around the art world, you can add The Baron ($59.98; Koch) to the list (which I think includes Lovejoy and precious little else). One of an endless string of interchangeable British action series, The Baron was the first live action UK show that premiered in color and starred a Texan who fought crime with his handsome assistant until American networks said ""Give us a broad"" and they dumped the guy in favor of a glamorous female sidekick. You get the entire 30 episode series which is fine but will appeal mostly to those who are already fans of the show. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
3,Price?,"I do not understand the Amazon price. I prefer Amazon, but bbcamericashop says the list price is $49.98 and is selling it for $42.98 plus $4.95 shipping."
2,Photo Paper,"I was happy to find the 5 x 7 photo paper. I had used HP Premium in the past, I did not hesitate to order 2 packages. The Premium Plus rating should have been better than what I had purchased in retail stores that no longer carry the product. This is not the case. The quality of the print is grainy and colors are 'faded' and even though the paper is advertised as 'glossy', the print quality is similar to matte. As a photographer who counts on quality paper for customer and personal satisfaction, I won't purchase this item again."
5,Great photo paper,"The HP photo paper worked out great for the 5x7 photos I wanted to print, and the price was very reasonable."
5,I'm happy with the quality of this paper,I use it in an HP 6500 printer and the results are awesome! I wish I could post some of the photos I've taken and printed with this paper
3,5 years old,"just recieved my package of hp premium plus photo paper.the product is dated on back 2007.and is not in the new packaging that is shown.(regardless if this paper works fine)if i would have known this was old product,i would have probably not bought it.my rating of 3 is do to misleading sales of this product,not the service from amazon."
1,Not good,This is not good quality. I could see separate color bands on the printed picture. But when I used a canon glossy II paper the same picture printed as it should.
3,doesn't work with Epson inkjet printers,"This feels like a nice paper, but it just doesn't work with my Epson printer. I get great results with 3rd party papers like Ilford. Don't know why HP paper doesn't work."
5,Wonderful CD for toddlers and up,"My three year old son loves this CD and listens over and over. We heard Itchie Itchie Ow one morning and he was singing it that afternoon and I knew we had to get the CD. My husband and I enjoy her voice as well, soft, calming and melodious - easy tunes to remember and about things to which kids can relate. She is somewhat similar to Laurie Berkner but Katherine's songs seem to have more relevance, i.e., kids understand muscles and bones and what itchies and owies are. I agree with the other reviewers; you will be listening several times a day so good thing adults enjoy as well!!"
3,"I suppose I take the other view, but...","...I think this game lacks in the originality department. The original ""Katamari"" was quirky, unexpected, charmingly simple, with a cast of strange characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Unfortunately, the sequel is bland by comparison.What made ""Katamari Damacy"" good? It was PRECISELY its originality. Where then is the originality for the sequel (which incidentally is priced 10 bucks higher than its predecessor)? That's not to say that rolling the katamari still isn't fun, but there really is NOTHING new here! The 4 types of game listed in the review below are exactly what was found in the previous installment; there is nothing here that sticks out in my mind.Even the soundtrack isn't quite as good (although the variation on the theme from the original - which is sung by a very good (clone of?) Tom Jones); I found quite a few of the tunes grating. I did like the new series of movies, though...For a higher price than the original, this fails to deliver..."
5,"This is almost a hobby, not a video game ...","As in the previous game, the King of All Cosmos has destroyed the stars in the sky, and it is up to the Prince to go to Earth and roll up objects into a ""katamari"" -- a kind of sticky ball that grows as you attach things to it -- so that new stars can be built.Unlike its predecessor, We Love Katamari has relatively few ""standard"" stages. Instead, most of the stages give you some kind of specific challenge -- rolling with a burning katamari without letting its fire go out, rolling entirely underwater, getting as large as you can with a finite number of objects, and so forth.As a result it is rather harder.Nevertheless, if you've played and enjoyed the first game and want more challenges, this is the way to go. Fun new stages (and way more of them), a much larger World stage, and lots of weird and freaky challenges to try."
5,We ALL Love Katamari,"""We Love Katamari"" is the first sequel to the smash-hit game, ""Katamari Damacy"". The game is much like ""Damacy"", in that the aim of the game is to roll things up with your Katamari. However, the format is a bit different, in that, instead of rolling things up entirely for the King of All Cosmos, you are rolling things up for your ""fans"". The story is also about the life and childhood of the King of All Cosmos, as opposed to a random family.The game has much of the same charm and overall weirdness of ""Damacy"". Its music selection is much broader; however, it seems that this is a somewhat harder game than the original, so be prepared."
5,Just plain fun,"We ordered this game because we had played the demo on another disc, and we thought it was funny. It has been a joy to play and lots of fun. My two sons have enjoyed it inmensely. Non violent, no bloody scenes, no fights, the game is just fun for anyone. I have even played it a couple of times and it seems like the kind of game to enjoy after a stressful day. I recommend it."
4,More Katamari fun...,"More of the same as before, but now you can work together. It's not as hard as some describe unless the person you're playing with really doesn't think like you. Can't wait to open more vs modes, as we're only stuck with 2 options. Overall, a great addition if you liked the first one."
5,We DO Love katamari,"This game is as good as the first. Lots of rolling fun, more fun music and you are able to get bigger and bigger. The graphics are great and there is lots of humor involved. I love that this Katamari takes you all over the world (there are recognizable landmarks). It's a lot of fun.The only frustrating thing to this game is that the King talks too much. Sometimes his words get in the way of what you're trying to do. But that's minor compared to the fun.We're anxious for another one to come out!!!"
5,Love this game,This game is so cute and a lot of fun to play with others taking turns. If you've been to Japan it makes a lot more sense!
4,I love to roll $hit,"This game is a lot of fun. The level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music isn't as good in this newest version, but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days."
5,You'll never get tired of this game!,"This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play. You don't exactly ""finish"" it, like other video games, but are always trying to beat your fastest time, so it doesn't get old as fast. As a matter of fact, we wore out our last copy and this is our second.I love it and I'm the parent! My kids and I play it together and cheer each other on.The only thing I would change is make the two-player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally. I would keep them in the corner instead.Overall, highly recommend this game. More than your money's worth."
4,Addicting and silly,As addicting as the first game. More variety of stage goals.Lost a star due to long boring dialog and there is no indication of how well you did. You can repeat levels forever and try to beat your personal score. Would like a more conclusive feeling or some reward indication when you do extra well on a stage. Also they changed the name of things you roll up to print one letter at a time. Which is very annoying since you don't have time to stop and wait for the name to finish.
2,Beware of MSD,"msd must stand for; mama says don't. don't ask for help from the customer service professional. ""This would be a great job, except for the customers."""
3,"Basic functions work fine, but advanced set-up fails.","I have been using this router for about a week and I have my network connected and working fine, but many of the set-up features (Access Restrictions & Connection Logging for example) do not work. I have been on the phone for hours with tech support, only to finally be told that, ""Oh, this is a known issue."" This router is not so new that they haven't had time to work out the bugs. It's just sloppy business in my opinion."
3,Expensive - there's a cheaper way,"Here's how to get this working for much cheaper.If you have a desktop.. get a wireless router, set up a wireless network but without a WAN. Then plug in the broadband card from sprint on on of the machines (preferably a desktop - u can get a usb version of the card).Then set up all machines on the wireless network to use the other computer as a gateway.. Simple, very powerful.. cheap!"
1,Non Working product,"The device does not recognize the pcmca card from sprint. I tried all the neccessary updates, did all the recommended and advance configurations as well as firmware updates. I'm begining to suspect that I bought a bad product."
3,"Buy two of these, you will need it","Having used one of these for nearly a year, I've changed my mind about this product. I feel that you really need to have two, one to use for target practice due to all the reboots and wifi failures, and one to hopefully replace the first one you hooked up that will remain working. When it works it is nice. When it works..."
1,Amozon SUCKS! and its reselers SUCK even MORE ...,"Amazon SUCKS! And its resellers SUCK even MORE ...I place an order for my item almost 10 days ago and paid an additional charge for its so called ""expedited"" delivery. As of today I still do not have the order. Amazon ""Customer Service"" points the finger at the reseller - it figures!!! And the reseller has not even responded to any of my inquiries.This has been a lesson for me to NOT deal with Amazon AGAIN!Come on people - let Amazon hear it ..."
3,Very informative. Very little organization.,"I found the opening chapters of this book very informative. However, the section of pictures could use some organization. If there is a pattern to how the pictures are organized, I have yet to discern it. Very few if any dates are attributed so it's not organized chronological. Very few pieces are attributed to designers so that's not it either. Some pages seem to have a theme but are unrelated to the page immediately before or after. It seems like photos were grouped by what would fit on the page.Great information and the jewelry is very well photographed. If it were better organized, I'd absolutely love it."
1,NOT Dishwasher Safe,"According to the product description, this item is dishwasher safe. I found it exceedingly difficult to even get the decanter into our dishwasher in a position where water would spray into the opening. Then, after the first washing, there was a chip on the spout. Overall, this decanter is not as durable as I would have expected. The thin glass on the spout is a chip just waiting to happen. I didn't keep this item. I returned it to Amazon."
4,Durable little machine,"This was a good price on an all stainless steel product. The tower and the auger on these devices are most prone to breakage, and most machines use plastic or nylon on those parts. This one is stainless steel and I feel it will be more durable over time."
4,very good,"once again shabba has shown that he is indedd the king of the dancehall.this fact is reinforced by such hits as respect, the jam and the ting a ling remix. a must have for all shabba fans. sonicdis@mailexcite.com"
3,banshee wailings,"The songs are the banshee wailings of an off-key, overweight, drunkard. I had the dubious pleasure of hearing these songs several times, in live performances in Los Angeles. During 1998-2001, when the band toured LA several times. While the studio versions on the CD are cleaned up, in terms of noise suppression, there is little improvement to the intrinsic quality.For some reason, in their home town of San Francisco, the band has a following. As evidenced by the positive reviews given by others."
2,"This type of music k##cka#s, when it is done right.","Besides the lyrics which are funny as s$#%, the music seems like it needs a bigger engine. The trailer trash thing to has been played to death and while I think the songs on take a good stab at it, it doesn't rock as hard as I thought it would."
5,stan clock,Ship's clock runs on battery. Keeps excellent time. Very happy with this purchase. Arrived on time that was listed.
1,Never Got It,"Amazon showed this as available through BoatersWorld at a very attractive price, so I ordered one. What showed up was a Weems and Plath ruler for plotting GPS data to a paper chart, not the clock. I order a lot of stuff, so I thought I'd ordered it or someone had ordered it for me since it was Christmastime. I complained that I hadn't received it. So, I get a phone call from Boatersworld and they tell me they'll get it out to me. I get another ruler. I call them back and get stonewalled by some guy with a middle eastern accent. They aren't budgeing, I'm not getting that clock; they won't even admit its existence. Even though I suspect the price was a mistake, it was their or Amazon's mistake and I should have gotten the advertised clock at the advertised price and if they lost money, it was their problem. Anyway, I returned the ruler and got my money back, but I should have the clock."
5,Great Product !,"This is a great product. I am on my laptop for hours at a time. It used to get hot and shut down with out warning. Since purchasing the Vantec LapCool, it has not shut down once!!"
3,"Detailed writing, but lacking credibility in places.","The authors present detailed and complex research very clearly and offer the reader a comprehensive study of one particular Manhattan project spy (Ted Hall). There are places, however, where history is turned into to sensationalism. Granted, this is meant to be a case study, but at times too much emphasis is placed on Hall's contribution to the spy network. One questions how important any individual person was in a secret operation so large. The authors fail to distance themselves from their subject and consequently do not write from a totally credible perspective."
5,"About one fifth of the way through, enjoying the book.","Interesting book, well written. Fascinating. Fills gaps in my appreciation of 20th Century history."
3,Strip,"This is a more of an FYI, instead of a review.Kelly Jaye is a lovely woman who strips in various clips & then puts clothes back on. I suppose for those who love to see a woman dress herself.Tereza is another lovely woman who strips & her vids are more explicit (no penetration). She was a nude model who did 1 XXX scene, not seen here.The quality of the movie appears to be shot on VHS & eventually put on DVD.You get about 30 mins of each of them exposing themselves to the camera. If you find Kelly worthy of your pedestal, it's worth the money. Shipping made the wait a bit long though."
3,It's okay but leaves a thin black line on the paper,this toner is good quality but the cartridge leaves a thin black line on the paper when it prints out. If the company could eliminate this problem......this toner would be perfect....I keep my laser printers with updated maintenance and it printed fine until i bought this toner....PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM and I will be a repeat customer. I love the price.
1,Making promises he can't keep.,"Mr. Dalbey and his ilk are, well, wrong, making promisesthey can't back up. Anyone who has an infomercial shouldbe regarded with suspicion, and Mr. Dalbey shows why. Hepromises an easy way to riches, and there IS none, except forifomercial operators who'll say anything to get your creditcard number, then probably charge all sorts of unordered stuff on it.BEWARE!"
5,THAT Man!,"Grrrrrrrr! Picasso didn't know how to love anybody Dora stated. A compelling love story between a man who was an artist and a woman who was not only a photographer but a painter. She is very sensitive and grows very quiet in her later years, a recluse almost. And she said she never forgot about him."
5,Picture Perfect,Since this is my very first digital camera purchase I don't have any others to compare this one to so am giving it 5 stars. I'm finding it very user friendly especially for an amateur and everyone I've sent photos to have commented on the great quality of them. I love the camera so far and all of it's features. Great camera especially for the price! A thumbs up for this one!
5,Great little camera,"Two days after I got the camera I took great pictures of my son's wedding then 2 days later we went to Canada and took more great shots, it's fast enough that I took a picture of a wolf running. The batteries last a long time, had taken over 200 shots befor changing them and they weren't dead yet."
4,Nice little point and shoot....,"This is a very nice little point and shoot camera. Love the features that are included with it for different scene shots. Enough manual control as well to change your results if you want to.I didn't even have to install the Easy share software, just installed the camera driver that talks to the camera and off and running. Just wish that it had come with a soft case."
5,Easy tro use,"I bought my camera about a month ago and have used it outdoors and indoors. The pictures are clear and sharp. It is easy to use, point and shoot. There are features I haven't learned to use yet, but I like the selection of options on camera for all different conditions. The battery life is a lot better than I figured it would be on a digital camera. I have no complaints with the camera at all. It is a quality product. I also like the big LCD screen. Is is bigger than a lot of cameras I have seen."
3,"5 for the camera, 0 for the crappy software","Honestly, I'm not really sure how to rate this item. I bought the camera, as well as the docking kit and battery charger (which I haven't used, so save your money and don't bother with it). The camera is great. Easy to use, takes great pictures, and downloads like a dream.There are dreams and then there are nightmares -- with brings us to my computer and the Easy Share software which is fighting me every step of the way in it's efforts to completely take over my computer. I can't tap on a picture in my freakin' email any more without the Easy Share program coming up to tell me this picture isn't in any files. I turn the computer on and have to fight Easy Share in it's efforts to come up whether I want it to or not. I can't even go to ""My Pictures"" any more because Easy Share comes up instead.If I had it to do over again, truly I wouldn't. I could have gotten another kind of camera, gotten the same good pictures with a whole lot less aggravation."
2,Lacks durability,"I bought this camera for my wife 2 years ago (i.e.,Jul 2007.) I liked the camera and my wife did as well. The camera was seldom used and looked brand new when it quit (never dropped, wet or dusty & kept in soft case when not in use.) The lens stuck in the out position and nothing I tried would make it return, it quit taking pictures as well. The repair price was $80 plus S/H to Kodak and $91 plus S/H to an independent repair place. Except for the durability issue the camera was the best one we had. Sad to say Kodak may be the best brand around but it's another brand for me. Durability is the number one priority for me since my pockets are not full of cash."
2,I am not impressed,"This camera has been a headache since I got it last year. The major flaw that I have found is that the flash is entirely too bright. Most of my pictures with the flash come out looking like things are glowing. I have tried playing with the flash but it doesn't work.Another issue I have with it is that it takes too long to get the picture. Again, I've experimented with settings but it doesn't help. The pause is long enough to screw up any posed shots (someone thinks the picture was taken and moves) and forget action shots.If anyone moves, the picture gets a blur. Oh and let's not forget that sometimes parts of the picture seem blurry even without anyone having moved.I can't wait to find a better deal on a camera and get rid of this one. I had an older easyshare before this one and LOVED it. This one, not so much."
4,good camera,I have purchased Kodak cameras in the past and always find they are very good for the price. Easy to operate and good quality of pictures.
5,Great little camera~,"I bought this camera for my dad who is electronically illiterate =P He uses it for work, and it takes nice pictures for a point and shoot."
1,i don't recommend,"The material is hot and sweaty, doesn't breath. Also the design and fit is not right for my shoulder problem. It presses down on the corner of my shoulder. Needs to lift it up/in. I get better results looping an ace bandage around my armpit (under the hurt shoulder) and neck."
2,"Almost great, but...","Everything about this book was very well done for the target young-child age group. Honest, but with funny cartoons to make it a more accessible/comfortable topic. However I did not think it was necessary to go into a two page description of what sex and orgasm feels like - yes, two pages! Inappropriate for the target audience of the book. Since I thought the rest of the book was fine, I just ripped out the second page of the sex/orgasm description. Really people, all you needed to say was ""it feels good"" and move on!!!"
1,I didn't give this to my daughter after all!,"I really did not like the way the book was written, I was cringing reading it myself and decided my 11 year old is not ready to read some of the things the book talked about and the way it was explained. I'm going to buy a human biology book that explains reproduction in a more educational way."
3,Where Did I Come From?,"My son read this in addition to another similar book, and said that this book has less information in it."
2,NOT so great,"I bought this book to read to my 6 year old. After receiving it and reading it I realized its a bit strong. This book goes into detail about the actual act of intercourse and what happens. A more immature perspective on it rather than just the facts. It gives a poor description at that. I am not one that shys away from talking about this subject with my children, and this book gives a poor decription of it all. I would rather give my kids the facts and a more christian background and explanation on birds and the bees. I did read some of this to my oldest daughter and I had to fill in where the book is lacking and skip certain things so I could better explain them.Very Disappointed and do not understand why this book has been around for 30+ years."
2,Offers too much detail in my opinion,"Although I believe this book may be suitable for some kids, I do not believe it is suitable for my son and that is why I did not give it to him. Some pages from the book actually made me turn red! It is my opinion that kids do not need to know all the details provided in this book in order to get the message of where they came from. An edited version would work better for me."
5,Great Book To Teach Kids About Sex,This is a non threatening book that gives parents a way of addressing the question Where do I come from? It's a must read if you are uncomfortable about talking to your kid about sex.
5,It's true and we don't need to be ashamed as we all came the same way.,"A great book! Realistic and graphic but not inappropriate graphic. It's about time we tell our kids the truth about life and give up the non-sense that the stork brought us. (I wish my parents would have informed me of this before I learned the incorrect truth through TV and movies)Parents are still needed to explain the real. and with that thought in mind, I also suggest with this book; Linda and Richard Eyre's, ""How to talk to your child about sex""We need to start telling the truth to our children and turn the TV/Video games off as their way to learn about sex."
3,Bought this book for the nostalgia...,"Somehow, we had this book when I was a child, but I was never allowed to see it. So, I had to resort to sneaking it out of its hiding place sneaking peeks of the ""scandalous"" illustrations inside.I purchased this book purely for the nostalgia of those memories. But, now that I've actually had the time to read it, I don't think this is the best reference book to use to explain sex to your children. It is a tool, and can give a parent ideas of what to say to their children. However, it is very wordy and does not appear to be a book that you would read along with your child.So, when the time comes, I will take another look at this book, but I imagine that I may purchase a more elementary book that I can read along with my child."
5,Appropriate for ALL ages,"12/15/2010I teach Teen Health to young men and women 12-13 years of age in an urban American city of wide diverse backgrounds. After reading the science texts and much discussion about values I read this book to my students. The reaction varies. Some giggle, others are calm, others close their eyes. The book enables me to place the act of sex in a context they have some familiarity with while the textbooks put sex in a back closet of a doctor's office; both have their place in my course.Additionally, I used this book with my young sons and I also found my father reading it. I think it is very good.RES"
3,The best 30 years ago... now just ok,"This is the book that my mom read to me when I began to ask about sex. However, we ordered this and ""It's So Amazing"" and opted to use the latter to discuss sex with our seven year old. ""It's So Amazing"" has a more biological approach and that is what our daughter was most curious about. Also, I felt that the other book was more comprehensive and will be a valuable asset in the continued discussion."
5,Knowledge Shared,"When my grown sons were reaching puberty nearly 35 years ago, I researched many books on the subject and was disappointed in all of them. One, for instance, showed different kinds of animals mating but the only picture of people showed a man and woman face up next to each other in a bed. What kind of lesson is that?I was lucky and found this book which nearly every little boy in our neighborhood read with my sons. I am now ready to pass it along to my great grandson and hope that it shows him that sex is normal, can be fun and that it answers some of his questions.One of the memories that I enjoyed in looking back at this book is the picture of the man and woman greatly resembled my deceased husband and my self at that time. LOL"
3,Remeber this book back in high school,When i was in my high school years. a teacher brought a book and tell a story you know what i am talking about. I didn't expect what it shows until i got older and get use to things like this. that book looks a bit weird and creepy the way those characters look and when i seen a cartoon show and it didn't look too bad. i think the cartoon looks more better than the book.
3,"Follow up and have a conversation with your kids, don't rely on the book","I wanted to say more positive things about this book. I think that it may be a bit too explicit on the sex act. My parents gave it to me as a child and it made me very curious about sex. I became sexual at a very young age, only 7 years old, and I sincerely wonder if this book and its pleasant description of the ""sex act"" made me want to try something that I was simply not old enough for. Most people would say ""of course, you were abused"", but the ""boys"" I became sexual with were kids themselves. Although one could argue that a 12 year old child should know better when fooling around with a 7 year old child. I don't mean to be so detailed about my own life, but I really feel that this book peaked an interest in me and perhaps not enough follow up was done to explain that this act should take place ONLY between people of a certain age."
3,A little too much information...,"I purchased this book to use when discussing ""the birds and the bees"" with my 8 year old daughters. I chose this one based on a recommendation by the authors of another book and the reviews at Amazon.com. After I received it, I knew that it was just a little bit too revealing in certain areas and decided not to use it. It seems like a great book, however; sometimes too much information before they are ready is not a good thing. I think I may keep it and share it with them when they are a bit older, perhaps when we discuss puberty, etc. in a couple of years."
1,Have the talk WITHOUT this book!,"I ordered this book to use for ""the talk"" with our 8-year old daughter. I did not like the content or the style it was written. It went way to far with describing what intercourse and orgasms feel like. The chubby, silly-looking, naked man and woman maybe be age appropriate (although somewhat disturbing), but the content is not suitable for children aged 4-8, as stated. My adult siblings read through the book and couldn't stop laughing. I wish I would have read through the reviews on amazon before I ordered the book."
5,where did i come from?,"Ordered 2 copies of this fun and informative book for gifts. condition as promised, delivery on time, price competitive. Already gave the first book as gift and it was very well received. Thanks!"
4,Good book,"Easy to understand - an excellent book for teaching Tweens about the facts of life. Factual, easily read and detailed."
4,Very good buy!,"This was very informative, factual, and laid it all out in a way that kids can understand. My husband thought it was a little too descriptive but our son seemed ok with it and I believe that introducing children to sex in age appropriate ways is very important to the development of their own sexuality."
1,just too...something,"1. Too much focus on sex act (in my humble opinion). The whole description of sex = tickling just weirded me out and seemed highly inappropriate/unnecessary for the target audience.2. Too sexist--where is the discussion about the egg? Why is sex something that happens when a man wants to get close to a woman? Way biased.3. It also was biased toward traditional, hetero, nuclear families, referring to the man and woman as ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" and no discussion whatsoever about other types of families or relationships. Having a stepfamily myself, I took issue with this more than anything else.After much discussion and solicitation of opinions from other adults, concluded this was just inappropriate for a 7-year-old boy. Returned it and purchased ""It's Not the Stork"" instead and feel much happier with that choice. It's not overly focused on describing what sex feels like (???) and does a nice job of talking about the many different types of families, mothers, and fathers."
1,Where Did I Come from?,"I have a 7 year old who has been asking a lot of questions about how babies are made so after reading the reviews I thought this was a great age appropriate book. I was extremely disappointed. The book read more like a guide for pedophiles, not a book for young children at all. I might give this book to an older child in their teens, but the graphic descriptions of the actual sex act seemed to almost encourage sex. I feel that it left the reader feeling like, ""I want to try that!"" Not a message to give to small children just learning about sex or even older teens maybe."
2,TOO MUCH 411,"I purchased this book to help explain the birds and bees to my 9 year old twin girls and prepare them for puberty. I also bought 2 other books. This book, in my opinion, is way too graphic. It goes so far as to expain an orgasm in detail. This is way more information than I wanted to give my young girls. I would say it would be better for older kids, but, it reads very sing songy like it was meant for kids even younger than mine. Try instead,Ready, Set, Grow!: A What's Happening to My Body? Book for Younger Girlsby LYNDA MADARAS -awesome book! The only one you will need-check it out and my review"
1,Where did I come from?,"Very disappointing. I paid 50 bucks to sign up for the Eyres site and they said to get this book. Library didn't have it so I ordered it. Its terrible, the pictures are tasteless and untactful and inappropriate for the age at which you are teaching this subject."
2,WOW. Porn for kids?,"This book is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too detailed for kids. They don't need step by step instruction on how sex is done. I am sorry I bought this book. I will not be using it to talk to my daughter. I am unsure as to what I am going to do/use, but it won't be this book. Seriously, I was shocked. Not good, and I am not a prude. There just has to be a better way to explain it to kids without traumatizing them!"
1,Too graphic,"This book is very graphic, the text and pictures. A young child does not need to know this much information. I really disagree when he describes having sex is like being tickled. With so much sexual abuse with children, this is a very dangerous way to explain sex. I would skip this book, there are better for children."
1,not age appropriate for anybody,This book is definitely not for the ages of 4-8 as it states. Too much information. A child who talks about this content in the book would surely be in trouble at school. I don't think it's really right for any age. Could be used as a joke at a party maybe.
5,Blast from the past,This was a book that I had for my own children when they were young and started asking questions.Now they are grown and have children of their own and are using the book for the same purpose.Some things just never go out of date!
1,not for an appropriate book!,"okay I like the fact that the book is ""sily"" and has funny characters for people BUT after buying and reading this book before my child (9) sees it...I returned it! I think the BASIC facts should be given to any child, but should NOT go into that ""it's pleasurable and that the man goes up and down and up and down and gets friction and that they both wriggle and wriggle and it tickles until the man's penis squirts out a going substance called sperm."" Are you kidding? this is a highly recommended book? If ""kids"" are taught that is pleasurable and tickles etc. do you not think they will be starting sex at an early age? I let 4 of my other friends see this book who also have kids the same age as mine and they too were stunned. They could have left out a lot of stuff in this book."
5,the best way to learn about yourself.,"If you dont know how to answer your kids questions then you need this book. My mom gave it to us at an age that we already knew, but it gave a new look at how we got here and we passed it on to the rest of the kids in the family. Now I need one for my own children. I strongly suggest this book if your children, whom you think are too young, are asking questions and you cant or dont know how to answer."
5,Educating and Entertaining,Having been introduced to the process of reproduction (in an educated and tactful manner) at an extremely early age. I have the fondest memories of this book as both entertaining and educational. I used to read it over and over again. We also had the vhs. It indeed was a very great tool.
2,Not the best I've found for the subject.,"This book of ""the birds and the bees"" is lacking in many ways. The overview of anatomy is limited, and not very well explained. There is much discussion of the mechanics and energy expenditure of intercourse, but little attention is paid to fertilization, which is vastly more interesting to my young daughter. I would recommend ""It's So Amazing"" instead."
2,Skip It,The light hearted nature of this book was appealing but it did not offer much factual content. The book could be used as an ice-breaker but certainly not for getting down to the facts of reproduction.
2,Where Did I Come From,"I was looking for a very simple book with illustrations of the male and female anatomy that shows and talks about conception and birth--not emotions from the partners, illustrations of them under the covers, or discussion about mothers and fathers. This book is for heterosexual partners only."
1,Dissapointing,"Although I apreciate the frankness of this book, I was dissapointed by the emphasis on the male's point of view in the book. Considerably more information and pictures of penises are included than vaginas. Also, the woman's feelings, role, and consent are ignored in the discussion of sex. According to the book, people have sex beacuse ""the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can."" There is no mention of whether or not the woman wants to have sex or enjoys it. There is also talk of the physiological changes in a man when he's having sex, but none anout the women. And finally, lots of talk and pictures about sperm, but very little mention of the eggs role (""semen is how you and I and all of us started"") and no pictures of an egg. Instead it shows a picture of a sperm curling up to a heart."
5,"A delightful, wholesome book, and it's never too early","I was 4 or 5 when I first got this book, and experienced it asa bedtime story, ... . I think that is the best way to go. ... As soon as the child has questions, that's the time to give the answers in this book. By the time they're 10-13, it's time to get ""What's happening to me?""DO NOT think that this creates early promiscuousness. While my parents read me this book at an early age, I didn't have sex until I was 21, and that was safe sex with a condom. I know plenty of examples of people whose parents had little or no discussion with them on sex, and they learned by doing, typically in their early to mid teens. ... For the rest of us, this book is delightful way to foster a wholesome, healthy attitude in young children."
4,Where Did I Come From,Where Did I Come From was handed to me when I was approximately 10 yrs old. I has older siblings and heard bits and pieces of how I was made. The book was great. It helped me and was not quite as embarrassing as I had expected. Now I am an adolt and have a child who has been asking questions so I ran out to the Library to get the book. It was a lot easier explaining the Birds and the Bees through a book than my own words. Again it wasn't quite as embarassing as I had expected. I would love to have this book for keeps for the next child that comes along! Another book that was given to me at age 10 was What's Happening to Me. Its about going through puber tand what to expect. This book I keep on my book shelf so that whenever my child needs to look and read what might happen next through her adolecent years all she has to do is go to her room and read it privately without being embarassed to ask her friends. And she will get the right answers!
4,Following my Mother's example 25 years later. . .,"I doesn't seem like it, but just over 25 years ago, my mother sat me down with this book and we went through it. She was a teacher and very much loved books so we had our first talk about sex with the assistance of this one. Now, my daughter is 6 years old and asking questions. Although, I don't discourage her from asking, and I don't shy away from the questions, I'm not sure just how much detail I should get into with her at this age. So this book has come to my mind. I will purchase it and sit down with my daughter as my mother sat down with me. It's got cartoon pictures in it that don't make it quite so uncomfortable to discuss. And I prefer to give her the facts rather than for her get made up stories from other children."
4,Language more graphic than I expected,"I bought this for my 6 yr old twin daughters. The pictures were fine and I think in time the content will also be fine. It may be me, however, I wasn't ready for language describing (...), about how making love tires you out like jumping rope does(...). I am fairly conservative, so this may not be a big deal for others. I think that when the girls are older it will be a good resource for teaching them about where babies come from. Perhaps a book that is more ""basic"" will work right now."
1,Tasteless,"I ordered this book to share with my 7-year-old son as it was highly rated on this site. I regret my purchase. For me, right now, I want my child to be more familiar with ""the plumbing"" than the emotional side to the act of having a child, and I feel this book went a little too much into that (""wriggling so hard you think they're both going to pop""). While humor is good, I felt there was a little too much, making the whole act seem silly, as did the illustrations. Everyone needs to go about teaching the topic to their children in their own way. This book may have worked for other parents, but it just wasn't for me."
4,A little embarassing....,"My 10 year old daughter received this book from my mother-in-law who brought a box of books that were my husband's when he was a child. Her first reaction was ""Ewwww! Sick!"" Then came a round of rather embarrassing questions including her asking my husband if he puts sperm in me to which he quickly referred her to me! Eeek! My husband and I got a kick out of the comparison of an orgasm resembling a sneeze!"
5,Excellent,"I'm in an MBA program and have had numerous undergraduate accounting classes. This book is fantastic. It is FAR superior to ""How To Read A Financial Report"" by John Tracy. ""Financial Statements: A Step-By-Step Guide to Understanding and Creating Financial Reports"" by Thomas R. Ittelson is clear and concise. It's the best book I've found on the subject. I highly recommend it!"
5,Good for beginners,"This book would be an excellent supplement to a beginning accounting class. The author explains the material so that it is very easy to understand.But if you've taken intermediate or advanced accounting classes, don't waste your money. There isn't anything new in this small book. It doesn't cover all areas of accounting and the areas that are covered are not in-depth. Example: There is a brief mention of straight-line deprection but nothing about salvage value and no mention about the other depreciation methods."
1,"Great Book, Bad Kindle Book","I got this book to read on my kindle. And while it's a great book and is filled with tons of sound business advice, I do not recommend you buy it for the kindle, and here's why:Almost 60% of this book is formatted in a way that relies on you having two opposing pages. The idea is that on the right page you read a description of a transaction that a company makes, while on the opposing left page you see how that same transaction is tabulated in the relevant financial statements.The problem with the kindle is that you only have one page. So you first see how an entry is made on the Balance Sheet/Cash Flow Statement/Income Statement , then, after skipping the page, you read about the transaction the company made to affect those changes. So in a way it's like your friends telling you what they think of a movie before you actually watch the movie to know what they're talking about.In other words, do buy this book, but not on a kindle.."
5,An excellent book for those who wish to start finance,"After having read many financial textbooks, I think this book is amazing. The author did an excellent and remarkable work. To begin with, he took in very serious consideration his audience, which is people with poor knowledge in finance. Thus, his book is very easy-to-read and its content very explicit. Every single financial term is clarified with a layman's language. Moreover, for every single term, there is a very understandable example. Likewise, in every page there is a sheet explaining all the transactions. I strongly believe that this book is a masterpiece for non financial managers."
4,Good but Simple,"In my job, I have to review other company's financial statements, I do not draft them myself. While this book is a very useful introduction to financial statements, it focuses more on internal accounting and not higher level issues that someone reviewing financial statements would need. I would definitely recommend it as a good primer on financial statements, but it does not get into the anaylsis of financial statements that certain people (like myself) might find useful."
5,Excellent book to develop the foundations of financial accounts,"I learn by example and this book allowed me to do just that. With the 39 well-explained real-life like transactions the authors guides the student through many aspects of financial transactions. A very good book and well worth the read to develop a solid foundation to financial accounting. Not a comprehensive financial accounting book by any means, but does an excellent job developing the most important concepts. The book also provides an introduction to ratio analysis which is useful especially after going through the case. In all, very highly recommended! Good job Mr. Ittelson!"
5,Really helpful,"This book was for a business class and it was very helpful and informative. I will be keeping this one for reference later, as it's easy enough to understand for the future after I've forgotten all that I learned."
4,simple and easy to understand.,"This is a very nice book and yet very simple and easy to understand. Recommended to students, teachers, novice accountant and to those who knows nothing about accounting. This is a very good book to start. Just give it a try, I know you would like it."
4,Awesome helper for Accounting assignments,"I purchased this book mid-way through my Accounting Principles class for a guide through my assignments. I was really impressed at how thorough each step was. It gave a quick breakdown of what each step was and how to proceed with the statement. The definitions are set up outline notes style which I found helpful for crossing back to my notes and putting my own reminders in.The print is very large, which is nice when you have a textbook open along with an aide like this. I would recommend this as a classroom aide, I used it through two courses with Wiley Plus Accounting books."
2,Basics of the Basics,This book would be fine for someone who has little to no accounting/finance knowledge who wants to gain a basic (and i stress BASIC) understanding of some finance/accounting topics. If you want more out of this book than a brief overview of fundamental concepts you will be disappointed.
5,A Real Life Perspective for Small Business Owners,"This is the only accounting book I have seen that talks about common business transactions and then shows how each transaction effects the key financial statements. Most accounting books talk about an accounting concept and then give examples. In this book, perspective is reversed -- it follows the flow of ordinary business and explains how ordinary business transactions impact the books. It is very easy for a layman to follow. For this reason, I have recommended it to a number of my small business clients."
1,Financial Tables too hard to read in Kindle Version,"While the writing in this book is impeccable, the Kindle formatting of the financial tables is atrocious. There is a section where the author steps through how transactions flow from one financial statement to the next, and it is mostly illegible. Even at the highest magnification, his annotations and the financial tables are too small to be able to read. It's the most important part of the book, too, if you ask me."
5,Excellent!,"I purchased this book for an MBA course and ended up using it more than the assigned text. The author makes a complicated subject seem like childs play! Thanks to this book, I am confident that my MBA case analysis for future courses are on target!"
1,Worst book I have bought yet,"I bought 3 books, the one I am reviewing, ""Reading Financial Reports For Dummies"", and ""Guide to Understanding Financial Statements"". This book gives no information for beginners who are trying to learn how to understand financial statements. I read all 3 books twice, and I didn't get anything...and I mean nothing from this book. The other two were very well written.Reading Financial Reports For DummiesandThe Guide to Understanding Financial Statements. I suggest not wasting your money on this book. It is basically a lot of numbers with very little explanation. It is also confusing because the definitions are different and there is no explanation why they defintions change when reading a financial report."
4,Good but not consise,"It's clear and detailed. If you follow every step you will definitely understand everything. However, there are many overlaps which you may not need."
2,Boring accounting book,"For me this book was really boring and I couldn't even finish reading it.Buy a college accounting text book (previous printing). I have accounting 23a and it was $5. Don't be discouraged by it being a 1000+ pages. It's 10x more interesting and easy to read with tons of examples and pictures, questions, etc. Just read the first few chapters and skim through the rest. You'll be way better off."
5,book,Well yes it is a very good book and I believe that it would help someone that has had a little Accounting.
5,Financial Accounting,"If you're new to Financial Accounting, then this is a book to read! Accounting concepts are laid out in a simple to understand format."
5,Extremely useful!,"It is, beyond any doubts, a book which contains plenty of useful insights in a easy to follow and understand style."
4,Financial statements,This is a good tool for Continuing Education Students that are not clear on the layout or flow of the various statements needed for Financial Reporting.
4,Good Choice for Beginners,"Although the first half of the book seems naive even for begginers, second half reveals to be much better as author explains dinamics of connections among financial statements through a very interesting sequence of day-to-day operations of a simplified applesauce factory. In fact, even more experienced people would enjoy reading this part, as it is very clarifying."
4,Very good book. Kindle images not so good.,"This is a great, very consistent book about accounting. The example transactions are very nice, author shows a great understanting regarding subject and explains really well.My only complain is about Kindle version: when I read this book on Kindle DX several images don't have a good resolution, they are blur. Except this minor issue, I recommend this book to everyone interested on Financial Statements: if you want to learn about accounting, be a better investor or in your own business."
3,An exploration of the underbelly of Regency London...,"""Thieves Kitchen : The Regency Underworld"" is an exploration of the underbelly of society in regency London. As the writer points out in the introduction, this is an era more asscosiated with Jane Austen and fine literature than prostitues, murderers, gamblers, pickpockets and ""resurrection men"". The book discusses the extent, types and causes of criminal activty in London, and the painfully slow implimentation of the metropolitan police fore using both the authors text and contempary reports. It also contains a number of illustrations and cartoons from the period. A fascinating and not at all dull read for anyone that has an interest in seeing the seemy side of he Regency/Victorian period."
1,This book has no reason to exist,"Virtually nothing happens in this book. The Enterprise and Bloodwing rendezvous in preparation for a summit between Federation and Romulan forces and have a space battle with Romulan ships sent to capture Bloodwing's commander. There is much discussion of a powerful new doomsday weapon and many vignettes featuring characters that we have never seen before, do not see again (at least not in this book), and which amount to nothing at all. The ridiculous ending reveals that this is the first installment of a continuing story, but author Diane Duane has not even provided a provocative cliff-hanger to interest us in reading the next installment. Rest assured, if I ever decide to read any further (doubtful), it will be a used edition so that the publisher doesn't see any profit from this sorry excuse for a book."
4,To be continued,"It is clear that most of us are unhappy with the way Pocket split these books up. Swordhunt is nothing without Honor Blade, and even that is continued with no publish date known to us readers. Packaging a group of books as a series is one thing, even though it doesn't thrill me, but not providing the completion at the same time is an insult to our intelligence. It greatly detracts from reading a story when you have a year's intervention where your memory of details fades. Having said that, the story is outstanding. I detract a star from the rating because of the way it's split up."
4,Worked as advertised!,I installed this yesterday. It worked as advertised. Get it if you need it. Much cheaper than at the part stores!
1,Awful!!,"This pump was terrible! Don't waste your money. The bulb leaked so it won't provide much suction. After 5 minutes I finally got gas to the bulb, it leaked on my hand. Absolutely useless."
1,squeeze theapy,I bought this product to drain theoil from the lawnmower grank case. After squeezing the ball nunerous times I got just a little bit of air and no oil. I tried again and again and failed miserably. I think it would be easier sucking feathers out of a pillow. I give this product a thumbs down.
2,Suzy,"My son purchased this product and was very disappointed with it when he opened up the package. Everywhere the plastic tube was folded in the package, it was kinked and split open. Luckily he found another one at a near by store close to our home. We would not recommend this for anyone to buy. We found out it would cost us more to send it back than what he purchased it for. I think this is one of the first items we have purchased that we were highly disappointed in the quality of it."
1,Don't bother,"cheap POS made from China. Bulb doesn't work, hard plastic. Just buy some tubing and save yourself some money. R"
3,Good for the Price,"Item works as designed, but the connection could of been better secured, as it will leak while using. Would suggest putting electrical tape around the connections going into the squeeze ball and tube, to prevent leakage..."
1,Worst product of its kind,The Product failed in its first use. Leaks considerably when siphoning Gas. In the past I had better quality siphons like this.
1,Don't bother,"I bought two of these siphons, mainly on price. Big mistake. Both had the tubing so badly kinked when they arrived that they were unusable, even after trying to soften and fix using warm water.Simply does not work!"
2,"Slow flow, tube too rigid","I had this item for about six months before the bulb cracked and leaked. Before that it worked out for my needs in a pinch. That being said, it wasn't convenient or very well designed. The flow from my gas tank (appropriately placed above my target) was limited by the very narrow tubing. The biggest complaint that I have is that the tubing is very rigid and maintains its curl from the packaging. Since it stays curled, you have to hold it in place while the liquid is transferring or else it will pull out of one of the containers. That, combined with the low flow, means that you have to stand there for 15 minutes to empty a 5 gallon container. Annoying."
1,"Crap, crap, crap.....","Do not buy this. Thin hose, plastic!! pump bladder, not rubber. Go to Habor freight tools. I bought 2 from there and they are at least decent."
1,"Don't waste your money, cheap quality","I kept it for overall uses from garage to other but soon found out it is a cheap quality. The hose is stiff so it kept curling on me (splashing fluid everywhere). The screw-type connectors at the hose ends are cheapy plastic so even if it was really hand tightened, fluid would still leak or at best seep through those weak spots. I guess the only bright spot would be the siphon bulb but even that is stretching it. At this point, I think it got tossed in the trash while cleaning out the garage. Don't say I or the others didn't warn you."
5,Siphon pump review,"The pump is like the description, and it seems to be a quality product at a very good price. It works just like it is described. Why pay higher price for others that do the same job ?"
5,MoFi weaves its magic again,"I paid top dollar for this, and it was simply worth every penny. MoFi classical recuts are disappearing fast, and prices are going through the roof. If you need evidence of why this is, look no further...These are very solid performances from Slatkin, but the recording is the star here. The Elite recordings from Aubort and Nickrenz are simply some of the finest analogue (or any) recordings of orchestras in real acoustic spaces ever made. And Mobile Fidelity, as always, has done them justice, in full. The results are startlingly realistic sounding in timbre, coherence, transparency and staging. They simply sound truer to life of real orchestras than most recordings you will ever be fortunate enough to hear. And I speak as a frequent aficionado of classical concerts in and around London.On a good SACD-based system, this is a marvel.SO, WHY NO NEW CLASSICAL SACDs, MoFI?!Buy it whilst you can."
3,is ok. not that great,gives a simple explanation of the games in casinos. so simple i didnt even need the book. it did have a section on sports betting that i didnt know about.i would only recomend this book if you are new to casino games
2,"Okay for short term use, but wont last the long hual","We got one of these from Big Lots, it wasn't bad for the price but we didn't get it thinking it'd be long term. With in 6 months the bars on the front to keep the mattress in place started to bend. You can bend them back, but their weakened and will only snap off in a matter of time. Once they break off they leave behind a sharp piece that can damage your mattress, so just leave it bent down or cover the area with some tape to avoid ripping. Sadly once those are gone your mattress wont stay in place very well, I'd suggest getting one of those grip pads to help it stay put.It's not great, but it'll work for a first apartment or dorm. Ours was like $70 for the frame, so when it fully dies in 3 or 4 years it's no huge waste."
2,Nice travelogue but poor as a cook book.,"Lots of beautiful photos of Naples and Campania.Poorly edited with many errors on Neapolitan language. Obviously written by a non-Neapolitan.Few photos of foods. Makes me wonder if the recipes were ever tested.Better choice is Naples at Table by Arthur Schwartz.Buy this for the pretty pictures of the Amalfi coast, because as a cook book, I think it's a dud."
4,The second power trio?,"Some great songs, some great guitar playing and, on the hole OK singing. That's it. No it isn't! The nergy that flows out of these songs is ulifting and it is great to play this album while in trafinc jam or just before exams. Cream with some Stones added."
3,"Good DVD, but error on packaging.....","Hi, I ordered this DVD. It arrived in good condition and looked good.However, there is an error on the packaging. It states that the DVDs have English/French/Spanish subtitles.Only the DVD titled, ""Go Eat Worms"" has these subtitle options. ""One day at Horrorland"" does not. As a result, the person I bought this for was only able to watch one disc.Otherwise, ""Go Eat Worms"" was good."
5,Made in the USA,I saw this on ABC News on their Made in America segments. I bought 2 one for me and another for my father for Christmas. I've used this a few times already and it worked pretty cool.
5,Great tool,"This is a very useful tool and it is made in the USA, not in China like everything else seems to -- horay!"
5,What a cool tool!,I use this to get off hard to remove bolts when I don't have the right size socket. I also use them to remove stuck endcaps and other things. They work great but you should get a small and a large one to cover all your bases.
2,A Bit disappointing,"I have Anita's previously published DVDs (Total Mom Sense, and Purse-onality) and they were absolutely delightful! However, this one was a bit disappointing - not nearly as funny as the other two DVDs I've mentioned. I think she used all the good stuff in her previous DVDs and this one just doesn't have the content I expected, based on the others I had seen. Personally, I would save yourself the money on this one, but buy one of these others instead."
4,hilarious!,"Definitely one of Anita Renfrow's best! Funny, touching, Christ centered. An extraordinarily talented vocalist, musician, comedienne. She puts life in perspective."
4,It is a GOOD GAME but IT IS NOT PERFECT!!!!!!!!,"The ""create your own skater"" thing is cool, but, sometimes you lose your guy behind walls. My only complaint was that you could not move the camera. I recomend it with 4 STARS!! :-( :-)"
4,smooth gameboy action,"Sure, Tony Hawk 4 plays better on the PS2. But for a portable system, this is probably as good as it gets. Sometimes, due to the 2d/3d viewpoint, it is tough to pinpoint a landing or how to get onto an obstacle. That is really my only gripe, b/c you can 100% throw down with Hawk 4 due to the trick engine. The levels are pretty big and each of 'em have lots of stuff to skate. Get this game."
2,Not Good For Gameboy Advance,This game is a dissapointment. Due to the gameboy's small screen and lack of buttons this game is extremely frustrating...not to mention the game's insane difficulty. Fortunately on Gamecube/PS2/XBox this game is much better.
4,awesome baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,it is an awesome game it is one of my favorite games. I think if you like sports games you would like it
5,"A great novel, a diffent style","This book by Julia Gray has some great elements of fantasy writing and is well written. The characters are appealing and likeable and the plot is original around a common one.I seemed to like it better than Eddings style. It is similar to Eddings, The Redemption of Athalas but with greater language and a better world. Julia Gray has created an intriguing world and character base. I can't wait for the next book!"
4,Doctors should love it,"My 3 year old grandchild loves it. She listens to what Tenderheart says and reacts to it. She thinks of shots now as getting a ""little pinch"". She knows she needs to put the voice ""to sleep"" so she can sleep with him without him ""talking"" to her while she is sleeping.Best of the Care Bears in my opinion."
4,"A good work, but would have like more depth","Overall, this is an excellent work on how ""anglo American"" culture has taken Native culture in such things as fraternal/masonic organizations (Improved Order of Red Men), youth organizations (Boy Scouts, Woodcraft Indians, Camp Fire Girls, etc), Indian Hobbyist groups, and more.However, I would have like to seen more substantial coverage in these areas. As a Boy Scout Leader and Arrowman, his coverage of Native culture use in youth groups could have gone further. This is little mention of the Order of the Arrow and other honor socities formed within the Boy Scouts based on Native culture (and the author is himself an arrowman!). And I don't recall if he mentioned the Y-Indian Guide programs!Still, a good work in this area"
1,What!,"This book was required for me to read for my class. I found the book very dull and dry. It left you thirsty and quite annoyed. It took too, long for Deloria to say what he wanted to say. The book kept pulling you along and made you very tired and sleepy. It is an excellent book to read if you have trouble sleeping."
2,A Brief and Subdued Departure,"While not the most important aspect, it is good for any potential buyer to know that this cd is 40 minutes long--actually 39:55.For those who love Kila for their driving and often humorous brand of neo-traditional Irish music, this recording may strike you for its subdued tempo and spare instrumentation. It's pleasant as background music, but for me the recording doesn't hold any surprises, any thrill, or even any particularly memorable moment. Oki adds a little to the collaboration, but surprisingly he seems to enervate rather than energize the recording."
2,REALLY SMALL BOTTLES,"The product smells great, however the size is ridiculously small for the amount of money I paid for the product."
4,GOOD BUT SAD!!!!!,"Gary McCarthy has written another good book. It is the story of Zach and Carrie Bennett. They are raised as sodbuster kids. Both are determined to get away from that life. Carrie gets taken in by a slick talking Texan. She and Zach travel from Wyoming to Texas to find him. He had promised to marry Carrie. They meet some good and some bad folks along the way. I guess that this is what life was about back then but it sure was tough. I did not like the ending. McCarthy has a way of making you feel for the people he writes about. You almost think you are there with them. A fast moving book, not a shoot out kind, just about family life and how two people and their parents handled it. If you like books about life as it was in the early west you will like this one."
4,Reflections From The Riverbank,I loved the book. I read it in one night. Could not put it down. What a sweet story. I've told several friends about it. Thanks Lyal- Bill Davis...
1,american? hedgetrimmer dangerous,"The trimmer works well. HOWEVER the handle broke off while using it to trim a hedge. If I was trimming overhead, I could have been seriously injured!To salvage the unit, I epoxied the handle back together and drilled two 1/4"" holles and then filled the handle with closed cell spray foam.I suggest you look for a better made unit from another company. No wonder it is no longer offered."
3,Action plus...,I loved it... lots of stupid idiots busting their buns for my entertainment..... don't let your kids watch it unless you want them to try being stupid on their motorcycles.
5,Question,"Can anyone tell me if this is the ""old"" HP soft gloss premium paper, rather than the newer formulation (instant -dry), which is totally inferior?"
2,There are better...,"This was not one of Packard's better books. Upon returning to the cave of time (read Choose your Own Adventure #1 for more details) you find yourself in medieval England. The king has heard of a forbidden castle that will enable anyone who conquers it to rule over all of Europe. Of course, you're a wierd person in a strange time so you're not exactly welcome here. Depending on how you go, the king may end up finding you or you won't ever see him. If you like fantasy books this one may be one to avoid. Except for the moving through time and one possible ending there's no real magic in the book."
1,very general and little new here,This book is laced with generalities that people could figure out without spending the money for book. The platitudes are only matched by the level of generality. There is a lack of addressing very specific problems that you face in projects. Better bypass this book.
3,Too Light for Experienced PM,"I just finished reading the book. I thought the writing style was clear; however, despite its claim to be useful to experienced users, I found it lacking. I thought its approach to the topic was very good - well organized, but it provided little depth. Besides any mention of earned value, the book did not mention methodologies, other than RAD. Even if this book serves as an otherview of IT PM it should mention different methodologies.The book is useful as a introduction to IT PM, if you understand it's limitation. Unfortunately, for a novice PM, THEY WON'T - that is the problem. The bullets points and checklists are decent, but they are not available on cd-rom or via the web."
2,"Not bad, not great - can't decide on the audience.","The book is very broad and shallow overall, however, in a few places (like Risk) there is significant depth. I would suggest that future revisions provide a consistent level of depth in order to peg its audience more specifically. Other books have been more professional and useful for my purposes in terms of a project manager in need of guidance, checklists, detail and examples."
2,Flimsy Chair,"Flimsy chair, not nearly as nice as the original wearever chair from several years back. Seat back pops up as soon as you lean forward, requires constant repositioning. Not happy with this purchase."
3,Overpriced!,"WearEver Hi-Back Deluxe Steel Backpack ChairI purchased this chair for a vacation to Florida and I was certainly happy with it and how it worked -- I bought the chair ahead of time because usually when you go to vacation/tourist destinations, the cost is more expensive -- BUT not this time! I was so amazed when I went to Walmart at the vacation site and found the exact same chair for $25 vs the $43 I bought it for. I usually have a hard time beating the prices from Amazon.com or there might be a few $ difference, but this was much more than I expected. Not a happy purchaser of this chair all because of the $18 difference!"
2,"Ok for me, but not for the men","Simply said, it is not big enough for the men. My friend sat in it and he's on the bigger side, but not enormous. He felt very cramped. It's great for me at 5'4"" and 120 lbs. I'm disappointed that it does not fully recline. The joints could be made of sturdier material, they are cheap plastic. It is easy to carry and I do like the pocket, but it is only useful for the smaller ladies and kids."
2,Manufacturing Quality Has Declined,"We had four of these chairs two years ago that were fantastic. Since then the manufacturing must have changed because everything has been engineered to lower cost. Weaker aluminum, cheaper fabric, narrower arm rests. . .We loved the orginal WearEver Chair - time has produced a definite step backward."
3,decent...but not great,"This chair has many nice features. The backpack straps free up my hands and the large pocket does fit everything I need for the beach. The chair as a whole, however, just feels cheap. all of the rivets rattle, the stitching looks weak, and it does not feel very sturdy. The cup holder works, but feels like it could easily be torn off. The wooden armrests are not sanded enough, and can cause splinters. I sanded and added polyurethane to waterproof them. The chair is also very narrow. I am only 5'6"", 160, and I feel like I am almost too big for the chair. The concept is great, but the quality is just not the best. It will work for me, but I would not pay full price for it."
4,Great Product just not what I ordered,Love the chair...it is a great beach chair. My only complaint is that I ordered a blue chair and instead got a green one. I still kept the chair but it was a bit of a let down.
4,Great Beach Chair!,"Love these chairs, and the camouflage is real unique, haven't seen anyone else at the beach who has one. I do like the aluminum ones a little better than the steal though, they are slightly bigger and probably worth the extra couple bucks."
3,"Chair not ""deluxe"" rather mediocre","This chair is well-constructed. It folds up easy and is light-weight to carry. It is also a fairly comfortable chair to sit in, and the drink holder is very convenient. On the down side, however, is that the chair does NOT fully recline. This chair is appropriate for a camping trip but not the best for the beach, which is what I had purchased it for. Overall, think about exactly what you want to utilize this chair for before purchasing."
4,Hi-Back Chair review,"It's a great product. A bit on the heavy side for long treks, and certainly not a mountaineer's backpack, but quite comfortable once you get there."
4,All Purpose HI-Back Fun chair,"This is the all purpose chair. . . beach, patio(indoors & outdoors), concerts, and yeah guys, when she locks you out of the house a place to sleep on. . ."
1,Too narrow,"This chair looks good, but it is very narrow. If you are thin, it would be a great chair, but for me, it was not comfortable."
4,Nice sturdy chair,I purchased the chairs for use when traveling. They weren't as compact as I'd anticipated but are extremely nice chairs that do fold away for storage.We'll use them as extra chairs for the yard and patio.
1,Do not buy this chair unless you weight less than 100lbs,There are many reasons not to buy this chair.1) The chair is sold thru Scrappy Sales which does NOT put its return policy on Amazon for a good reason.2) The chair does not list its dimensions because it is really a chair for children or very small adults.3) It is very uncomfortable - designed for the Chinese market where it is made.4) The price on Amazon is at least $20 higher than you can find at Walmart or other places online.5) For a very small chair it is extremely heavy. Go figure.I wasted $48 dollars (price plus shipping) I hope you do not.
3,Just OK,"This chair is way overpriced. The concept is good but it is cheaply made and you can tell. Also if you are on the heavy/wide side you might want to look somewhere else, it is really narrow."
2,Disappointed,"We recently purchased these chairs to take on our vacation. When we opened them, the one had a slight damage which occurred during shipping. We decided to not worry about it since it was not worth the hassle to return it. We tossed the packaging material and set off for a mini trip. On our first official use, the one chair's hem on the seat let lose and now has a hole in it. We are average size people so it was not due to an excess of weight. We are very disappointed with these with the cost we paid for them. We wish we would have just waited until we got to the beach and bought them there."
4,Very happy overall,"Great product, pretty much exactly as I expected. I would give 5 stars but I had two small concerns. First, the wooden arm of one chair had a small gouge in it that made it really uncomfortable when resting your arm. Amazon was very helpful in resolving the issue to my complete satisfaction, and I ultimately just kept my chair and sanded down and smoothed out the gouge, but nonetheless the overall experience hurts the product rating in my view. Second small issue is that the chairs are pretty narrow. This was not an issue for us, but be aware if you're a little on the wide side these might not suit your needs. Great product overall for what I needed though!"
4,Love the chair - identical on sale @ Walgreens for 50% less,"Chair works great upon first use today. Backpack works great, cooler actually fits with no problem in back + more stuff. Chair is incredibly comfortable and pillow comes off to use on your towel - score.All would be well, except I saw the identical one today @ Walgreens for $19.99."
4,narrow arm rest,The chair is good. It would be great if the arm rests were two inches wider. It causes my arms to fall asleep.
2,Camo Backpack Chair A Disappointment,"This is my third Rio Backpack Beach Chair. My first one lasted over 4 years of pretty constant use during beach season. Eventually the fabric began to get stressed and the pocket got holes in it.I replaced it with a lace-up ultralight chair. This one was really well made but the ground squirrels tore it up getting to my lunch. It only lasted a few months. Not the fault of the chair.This last one, the camo chair is the lowest quality of the three. Threads are already coming loose. The fabric slips along the metal tubing all the time and does not stay in place. The drink holder is not as deep as the other two and is attached less securely to the chair. And, finally, the strap clasps are not as well made and come undone causing the chair to open at inopportune times.I thought I could save some bucks by buying this model but I should have bought another lace-up chair. That's the best one made."
3,Paid Too Much,"I bought two of these beach chairs online for $44.00 each. I see them sold all over the beach here, the exact same ones, for $30.00 each. So I overpaid."
2,Nice chair but sits very low to the ground,"Well made, but it is not a practical chair for any one who has difficulty with their knees for sitting very low to the ground and then getting up. I didn't realize this when I purchased it."
1,Disappointed in supplier,"I ordered this item from Joe Muscle and found it for half the price with free shipping from another source.I tried to cancel the item on the same day the order was placed and no effort was made to honor my request.Two days later I was notified, by e-mail, that the item had shipped. I e-mailed the company back to inform them that when I received the item that I would be returning it. I was given an RA# and informed that when they received the item that they would credit my account minus the shipping fees. Don't think I will ever use or recommend this company to anyone. Wearever Hi-Back Aluminum Backpack Chair- WC04"
4,Camo Backpack Chair,Ordered this chair several years ago and needed another one. Works great for hunting birds in a field. It reclines and you can even sleep in it when waiting on the birds to come in.
4,pretty low,Comfortable chair to sit in and easy to carry. I wish it sat a little higher off the ground because as an older guy it's tough to get out of.
5,D.L. Moody books,anything D.L. Moody is good with me. thank you for having the books. i enjoyed reading all of his books they are wonderful indeed.
4,Not a bad story!!,"I am very fond of Jack London's novels. White Fang is my favorite. I watched this movie and I like it very much. If you like wolves, this might be a good choice!"
4,Enjoyable... but poor quality.,"Got this, and a few others by the same producers, and LOVE it! -- except for the poor recording quality. The songs are upbeat, fun and perfect for an afternoon ride in the car. My little one likes to sing along! It also ends with classical music, that seems to coincide with my little one dosing off in his carseat. The only real problem... and, it's a real problem - as I have this CD and a few others by the same company... the volume greatly fluctuates between songs. I'm always having to turn the volume down or up to make the CD enjoyable. Very unfortunate... because I do enjoy the music."
5,Great CD!!!,"My husband purchased this cd when our daughter was about 7 months old and she now is 13 months old. She absolutely loves the music!!! My 3 year-old niece loves the songs and playing sing-along! We play it for our daughter her all the time in the car when we run errands. She really enjoys the songs..we love the songs too!! I find it that playing this cd helps sooth her, specially during those times that she is being fussy. I'll definitely recommend it to any parent of infants and toddlers."
4,Good item for cheap,"This item is obviously not top quality, but it does what it is designed to do. The chargers can be used for any electronic device that charges via usb. Overall a great deal for the price."
1,Did not recieve what was advertised,"The main reason I bought this item (Other than a backup zune charger) was for the Car-charger with a USB adapter, so I could use it with all my devices.Unfortunately the car charger that I received was a hardwired zune charger, no way to swap out the cords."
4,Works,"Pros:- Cheap- FunctionalCons:- Cheap (in the other sense of the word)Everything works here, and at this point it's really hard to lose. For this price I didn't really expect a luxury item, and sure enough, the connector end of the cable fell apart on me after months of heavy use in my car. (Mind you, it still works, but ...) Overall, this is a pretty good kit for the price, just don't expect it to last forever.Nice plus is that the wall adaptor and car adaptor are good for charging any USB device, not just the Zune."
1,did not help ph level,I got this product to help my ph level stay at the correct level. However after one of my water changes my tank's ph level plummeted to the far acidic side. I used this product twice in a 24 hr period and it did nothing to my ph level. It is also yellow in color which colored and clouded up my water. I have a 55 gal tank which meant I had to use quite a bit of this product...in the end product did not work and I lost 5 fish.
1,Fish Killer,"The moment i put this in my tank, all my fish started acting sick and lothargic. this lasted untill at least 4-6 days, and i needed several water changes to remove this s*** out of the tank. I'll never use again."
1,Killed Some of My Fish,This is not a good product to use in taller tanks. It killed a few of my fish. Doing regular water changes is better than a chemical substitute. This bottle is very large and will probably be sitting in my supplies cabinet forever. Will not purchase this item again.
1,Great if you like yellow water...,"Easy Balance does do what it says it will do. However, it also does something not mentioned on the label - it turns your aquarium water yellow. If you're going for the fish swimming in a toilet bowl look, this might work for you. Otherwise, skip this product and get a Python to make regular water changes much easier.Python No Spill Clean and Fill"
3,Cute but leaks,Very cute cups and our 2 year old loves them. The graphics seem to hold up well but the hole where the straw goes loses it's integrity and starts leaking. For the price I was expecting more.
3,Not Straw Cups received sippy instead,Ordered these Elmo straw cups for my daughters 2nd bday party on 2/13/11 but recieved the sippy cups tops instead of the straws... I am so disappointed though my daughter is excited that Elmo is on the cup! Review is not for Take & Toss (as we love their cups) but the seller because they don't seem to pay attention to what is being ordered!
4,Sesame Street Straw cup review,"cups arrived as expected. Cute and durable. Haven't used them much yet because baby is 17 months old, but plan to soon."
4,I'll Remember April,"One of the many problems that occur when politicians declare war, even ""just"" war, is that people are harmed right where they live. And they are simply everyday people. This movie makes that very clear -- and makes it clear that ""the enemy"" are simply everyday people, too. Perhaps only politicians should fight wars."
3,"Not a great movie, but worth watching","Here's a small movie about 1940s America, when many were comfortable with their prejudices against Japanese Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack. It is a reminder that when people can interact as human beings, race is not nearly as important as character. If you know the Karate Kid movies, you will appreciate the performance of Pat Morita."
4,The best introduction to the French Revolution,"This is a small gem of a book and introduces both the characters and the influences of the period of the terror in the French Revolution. Like all good narrative histories, it maintains a balance between the detail and the sweep of history. Any book that is fresh and alive after forty years, begins to deserve the title of classic. Unfortunately history does not stand still and many of Palmer's conclusions need to be tested. It needs to be read alongside Soboul and Schama to gain an understanding of the complexity of this period. Even so, a great work that will repay careful reading.From this starting point, you can delve back into the influences that brought this group to power and forward to the Napoleonic period."
2,Get a sharpening stone,"Although these gouges are pretty well built, mine did not have very sharp edges. I had to go out and buy a sharpening stone before I could even use them. Surprised Grizzly would sell something of such average quality."
1,Stop!,STOP!STOP MAKING POWER RANGERS!NO ONE WATCHES IT ANY MORE.iT'S BEEN ON FOR YEARS.aND IT'S SO CHESSEY AND CORNY.pLUS IT LOOKS SO FAKE!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
2,Volume 1 dissappointing,"While the new series of the Power Rangers is interesting and my 5 yo loves it, he was very disappointed with the DVD. He has been waiting for it to come out and when we finally received it, it had nothing but some episodes from the new TV series. He has seen these three episodes (first three) already. The two bonus features of the older Ninja Storm series were nice, but overall it was not what he had hoped for."
1,BRING BACK ZORDON/ AND OR ALPHA 5,BRING BACK ALPHA 5 AND/OR ZORDON. THIS SERIES IS DEAD WITHOUT THE LIKES OF CHARACTERS LIKE THESE AND NINJOR AND THE ALIEN RANGERS. I WANT TO SEE ZORDON AGAIN AND/OR ALPHA 5 AGAIN. WITHOUT THEM AND MYSTERIOUS CHARACTERS LIKE THEM THE SHOW IS FALLING
2,Sequels are never as good as the original,"The worst thing they ever did was change the original concept, when they did it was ok b/c the original characters remained. This is meant for a younger generation than it used to be. My 3 year old nephew loves the power angers while the 5 year old could care less. The people working on this project know nothing about the original. Tommy wasn't the black ranger, he was the evil green ranger, who turned good and became the white ranger."
5,Wonderful DVD,"The DVD of DinoThunder was as good as advertized however, and people do need to know this. It DOES NOT contain Legacy of power, or back in black. I know for a fact from another website. It is a bookstore site by the way. Volume 2 is called Legacy of Power, and Volume 3 is called White Thunder and both are due out September 7th. I just thought for people who were hoping for both of those episodes and were disapointed that I would fill them in. Everyone have a nice night."
2,very poor quality,"very cheap. and poorly built. I bought a set from Grizzly, one has crack. when I asked them if they can replace it (even though I never used it) they said that ""warranty"" has passed. there is no reason to buy hand tools from grizzly, shipping and customer service kills the savings. Rockler or woodcraft makes more sense, as you can bring completely defective thing back. or at least have it in your hand before you buy it."
1,ok what the hell is this,"I could never understand these kind of bands. You say you hate big business and talk the talk, but can never walk it. I'm not a huge fan of the Bush Administration, but after the lousy ""Terror State"", how much more railing against the government can you do without sounding like an a-hole? Crass was a much better band than these guys. This doesn't even float in the same toilet as Crass, and nowhere near as inventive or creative. Oh, and to the reviewer who said ""There must be a reason why they signed to RCA"", there is. It's called getting more money."
1,Brainwashing the Masses,"It never ceases to amaze me how punk bands today consistantly preach against brainwashing when they do exactly what they condemn. Anti-Flag is nothing more than a gimmick band who got popular riding the ""Down with the establishment"" bandwagon with little real political commentary or discourse. That being said, I fully believe that bands (and anyone) should have the right to say and think what they want. After all, this is America, and I am serving in the Army right now to ensure that we have this right. It just gets to me how they are so willing to step on the very thing which symbolizes that right: The American Flag. This album is proof yet again that this is what they intend to do. I have no respect for this traitorus band and would never give them a penny of my hard-earned money. Besides, wouldn't a real communist refuse to capitalize on their music, anyway?"
5,Astounding,"""Engines of Creation"" is one the most thoroughly enjoyable books I have ever read. It is well constructed and well thought out, expanding on every topic from memes to early Internet to the future application of molecular manufacturing. This book really jumped onto the scene when it was first published because of the astounding proposals made. But rather than being just another science fiction book, I think it well grounded in sound engineering and physical law. As of yet, no one has disproved it, and Mr. Drexler is certainly well-qualified to make the assertions he does. I would recommend this book as a excellent primer to anyone seeking to learn the basics of molecular nanotechnology."
3,Nothing special. Rephrase & repeat.,"I read this book about five years ago. It was interesting and somewhat informative, but not very. Hard science, while present, was etchy and buried in page after page of the author's enthusiastic speculations of the marvels to come. I felt as if I was reading the same ideas over and over again. The content of the book could have been reduced to 1/3 of its published length. The reduced version could accommodate all the information provided in the current, without the sense of déjà vu that creeps in before you're half way through."
2,"Come on, folks!!!","This is not a book about what WILL happen; it's a book about what MIGHT happen - as in ""possibly""... ""maybe""... Nothing more! I snicker when I hear people discuss the wonderful benefits of nanotechnology - as if that ""science"" (to the extremes represented in some texts) would ever benefit them in THEIR lifetime. Sure, it may be fun to speculate about, but that's all it is, pal - speculation."
2,Out of date,"This book was written ten or more years ago and its whole approach is out of date. Drexler assumes that the nanoscale will work like the meso (human) scale, with little wrenchs and machines that look just like our human scale machines. He misses the whole concept that nature has been working at the nanoscale for years with biological mechanisms that don't resemble his devices even though they peform many of the same functions . Also he appears to ignore quantum forces which are much more significant at the nanoscale where materials behave diffently.The book is fine as a introduction to a whole new arena, although it is out of date. On the other hand, the promise of nanotechnology is probably even more exciting than he predicts."
2,It is dated and overly optimisic and simplistic,I did not like the book because I think that Mr. Drexler is a member of the 'grey goo' school of thought and as such is not giving proper consideration to thermodynamics. There is a second edition (2.0) that is available here: www wowio com /users/product.asp?BookId=503
4,"100,000 ft. overview of a technology that does not yet exist",I enjoyed the speculative nature of EOC. Too often we bumble into new technologies and only later in the process do we realize what capabilities it may bring. EOC attempts (fairly successfully) to bring a range of future possibilities to our collective consciousness.This book is best followed up by Drexler's and Crandall and Lewis' more technically oriented books on molecular nanotechnology.
3,This book is out of date.,"I was really ready to enjoy this book. I believe the future may well be nano. But the fact that the book was written over ten years ago, with a few changes made in 1990 became far too obvious, all too soon. The best example of this has to be the authors reference to the invention of Xanadus hypertext. And how ""a network of such machines could eventually mature into a world electronic library"". I suppose unlike most futurists, Drexler got this right. But if you want to get a handle on what's meant to be the dominant technology of the 21st century, I'd start with the newest material, not the oldest."
3,Interesting but meandering,"I would start by giving the book 3 1/2 stars. I can't bring myself to give it 4 but 3 represents mediocrity and the book deserves slightly more than that.In my opinion Drexler spends too much time in the setup and fallout of nanotech instead of getting to the meat of the subject. His comments about evolution and political repercussions deserved a chapter combined (maybe) but it seems like half of the book focused on these areas where he seemed out of his depth.In short, too little science and too much social commentary. Still a worthwhile read but somewhat dissapointing from what has been called a seminal work."
2,"Works, but EXTREMELY LOUD. Not for humans with ears.","Removes moisture as advertised.WAY too loud. Louder than my air conditioning, washer, and dryer combined. Sounds like a 747 Jumbo Jet taking off. Loudest appliance I have ever, ever, ever heard. Can't be good for anyone's hearing. However, it does drown out the neighbor's barking dogs.It's going straight back to the hardware store."
4,How dry I'll be...,"It's loud, produces too much heat and it looks funny, but it does the job. That's the good news. The bad news is, the bucket is clumsy and while it's easy to remove, it's hard to pour out the accumulated water without spilling it hither and yon.I use this dehumidifer in the basement and it does a pretty good job of keeping things dry but it does produce some heat. That's a problem if you're using it to keep things cool.Like all of our goods and products, it's made almost wholly of plastic and has a cheap look and feel.Speaking of cheap, I preferred this model because it has simple, mechanical controls. The other models have gone to electronics. So much for keeping it simple."
4,nerf nite finder,"I bought the nerf nite-finder because it was cheep. I didn't regret it one biT! It comes with a free target that I can nail every time, thanks to the scope! It is a spring action nerf gun that uses nerf micro darts. The problem with this is that the darts are micro that = easy to loose. But it's still a great gun with a blue color and can easily shoot 35 feet."
4,Confused,i just bought this gun 3 days a go and im confused.there seems to be a blue one and a yellow are they diffrent or is it just the colors?nerf nightfiner ex-3 and nerf night finder.can someone please tell me???????
1,DO NOT BUY,i got this gun together with the maverick and after just 2 days yes 2 days it wont fire. i say buy 2 mavericks as those work great! again i say DO NOT BUY
1,Not that cool,"One day, I got this toy at target and when I first tried it, it wasn't that powerful. When I always reloaded it, it didn't sound so powerful."
2,"Barney-Haters, Beware","Kipper gets full marks, but I saw nothing in the product lit about Barney on this DVD set, and as a parent trying to run a Barney-free house, I was NOT pleasantly surprised to hear our living-room suddenly erupt with the puerile exultations of the purple dinosaur."
3,"As a Christian, some things are questionable...","I picked this up at our library thinking that it seemed harmless enough. Granted, there's MUCH worse out there but some things to be aware of: A couple of the stories have ghosts and magic--as in a magic lamp that grants wishes. In this segment, the two little dogs are thrust into a strange land with a fire-breathing dragon--my 5-yr-old was afraid of him.The positives are that the characters are sweet and calm, I loved the little hamster named Roly Poly so if you're not bothered by the above mentioned items it's fine. Right now my daughter is too young to even understand what a ""ghost"" is (she thinks it's just another made-up creature). There was a dress-up segment, but no mention of Halloween (although dressing up as a ""spooky ghost"" came up again).I found the British accents to be annoying; but that's just me."
4,Not quite a breakthrough,"It's fair to say that the breakthrough touted by the authors occured quite some time back - I don't think that any of the 7 principles suggested could be said to be new or even that they are brought together in a new framework.Regardless, if you haven't used these principles before then it is likely to be something of a breakthrough. The authors present a remarkably well planned overview of the steps needed to come to creative solutions to problems.Many readers are likely to find hints of De Bono, Senge and even some NLP in the reading. That shouldn't detract from the book though - it brings some rather disparate structures together to achieve an extremely beneficial approach to thinking and problem solving.4 stars because it could have been edited down by 50 pages without detracting from the message."
5,Great Gift for an Awesome Little Girl!!,"I am a big fan of giving books as gifts and this book did not dissappoint. The story was simple, yet very eloquant - it is also very easy for children to understand. I looked this book up because the little girl receiving this book was named Beatrice. And I was plesantly surprised by the story. The big bonus was the reference to ""Ste. Sault Marie"" - The little gal's mom (my dear friend) is from the Soo - this book gives her the opportunity to talk about her childhood with her daughters. Thank you Amazon - Thank you Margaret Willey - Keep up the good work.(I will end up buying the complete series!!)"
4,Clever Beatrice really is smart.,"And poor, of course (they're always poor, have you noticed?), at least, she is until she heads up to bet her strength against a giant.Let's see... little girl... big giant - yeah, the giant thinks this is really funny too. Pity he's not as clever as she is. Through intelligence and plain old chutzpah, Beatrice convinces the giant three times that if she competes she's bound to destroy his property, so she wins her bets three times and goes home relatively wealthy. Not bad, not bad at all."
3,Stokowski conducts Mahler Symphony # 2 in England,"In this early 1970's recording, the redoubtable Leopold Stokowski gives a white-hot ""reading"" of the (at that time) relatively little-known Mahler Resurrection Symphony: it could be characterized as the expression of one who has too much to say in too little a space of time, thus the speed of ""speaking"" is rapid-fire, staccato, ""head-long"", and frenetic. The musical forces do well to ""keep up"" with this fierce timing from Maestro Stokowski, but I would think that they (particularly the brass and wind players) were tested to the limit of their lung-power by the end of the performance, and glad to be able to ""catch"" their breath after such a relentless testing."
1,"Mindless action, and its not even good action","Ma Su Chen has nonstop mindless basher action. Jimmy Wang Yu stars at the start and the end of the movie, and a woman fighter stars in the middle. All of the fights look the same and by the end I couldn't stand watching it anymore. The first couple fights are actually the best. The final fight seems like they put some effort into it, but it is really bad. Halfway through this movie I was thinking of turning it off but I made the wrong decision and stuggled through watching it until the end.I would go over the story but it is not done very well and that may partly be because the movie seems to be heavily cut.1.5/5Picture quality on the Crash Cinema DVD is poor, but it is widescreen. I had no problem with the pic quality, I just wish the movie was halfway decent."
5,the kriya yoga sutras of patanjail,"this book was purchased as a gift for my daughter, she keeps it on her night stand to reread for inspiration, she has told me she loves this book. thank you mrs ward"
4,Okay read,"I really enjoyed this book, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because two of the stories were... okay. I really enjoyed Ms. Alers story, the relationship that developed between Katherie and Gerald was beautiful. Ms. Forster's story was okay, it used alot of African words which made it a liitle hard to follow. Ms. Hill's story was good. Nina had the perfect job, that is until she meets Vincent. After discovering the reasons why Vincent won't give her company what they want, she is forced to choose between keeping her job and following her heart. Although I'm an avid reader of Mrs. Ray's work, for some reason I had a little trouble getting into this story. It was very well written but to me it just didn't grab your attention like so many of her other novels. All-in- All, the book was a good read."
2,Silly and funny,"The thing that stands out for me most in this flick is ""Just a little part"", which all the gals in the movie keep begging Tony Markham for. Also, William Marshall gives a very good but brief performance as the paleontologist. I like the music score, especially ""Jurassic Punk"". I bought the Family Version, so I don't know if there are any truly violent scenes in the movie which may have been excised. Dickens' animated and animatronic animals are realistic in design if not movement. In all honesty, I wish I knew what Don Glut and Kevin Glover had been trying to say with this movie. Is it a satire of Hollywood mores? It would be neat to see the proposed sequel."
1,Waste of money!,"This movie was a waste of film and money spent on bad actors! There is absolutely nothing about it to recommend. Hardly any naked girls, whats the point of it being an adult film! More like rated R. Avoid this film!"
4,Not JP,"OK folks, so it's not Jurassic Park. No one expected it to be. It's a fun movie with a lot of goofy characters who somehow end up together. Jeff Rector should have been the ultimate dork of a person transformed back in time to become ""super-stud"". It was just fun watching it. You sometimes wondered ""why"" but it was one of those ""I don't have anything else to do so why not"" movies. It really grows on you. I've got to commend Don Glut for his stop motion animation of the dinosaurs. That's not an easy task. Wow, that lizard 'really' looked real didn't it?Lighten up and just enjoy the movie next time with some friends and liquor. Amazing how that can improve the enjoyment!"
3,LOL,"I sure hope it was meant to be a comedy because I laughed all the way through it. Nothing award winning but a lot of fun. Being projected back in time by the talsman? Why didn't anyone else get to go? Not quite figured that one out yet. Blackula star William Marshall is by far the best of the actors yet used the least. I would have liked to see him sent back to those cave women!! THAT would have been great. Otherwise, once I figured out all the character names were fast-food products, it was very enjoyable. Down right appetizing! Check it out for yourself...."
2,"Karen Black making a ""Comeback"" movie?","The only qualities featured in the movie are the bodacious women. That is it. If you are a guy that likes viewing lustful babes on the screen, this movie has that, but you still are better off watching Kitten Natividad in her heyday.Karen Black must have been behind on a mortgage payment to lower herself to such depths to even think of making an appearance in the film."
3,Lotta Fun!,"This is one of the best no-to-low budget movies I've ever seen! It's pure fun from start to finish. A whole bunch of gorgeous young almost undressed gals, plus Karen Black! You'll want to see it over and over, and will it to your kids....."
3,Little stop-motion puppets intercut with busty girls...,"Ooookay. Where to start on this one.............. A supposed hollywood actor is magically transported to a lost world of stop-motion dinosaurs and brainless, busty cavewomen. Admittedly, probably the only place you'll get an array of scientifically correct dinosaurs other than Jurassic Park, but nothing to offer beyond that. The girls, despite being 'well endowed', are rather boring. Give 'Dinosaur Island' a look."
2,"Average Entertainment, but very little nudity/sex","1. This is an OK movie. Not Great, but not terrible.2. Plot is OK3. Very little sex scenes/nudity."
1,"No zip, no talent, no fun","I bought this thinking it would be a fun ""B"" Movie but the acting in this movie was so bad it was funny. I don't know why it is getting so many tags making it seam like it's a sexy movie with nudity. There is one scene, don't blink or you will miss it, dumb story, dumb writing, did I say bad acting......junk......it was over priced at 99 cents"
5,DVD-DVG- maka-loola!,"This is your dino-dream come true! It's a video about a ""primeval"" fantasy land inhabited by dinosaurs & cavebabes created by Don Glut, an expert on dinosaur film history and the science of dinosaurs. Karen Black is still ""cave-babe-alicious"". And, for inexplicable reasons, those scenes featuring cavemen passing gas had me and my wife in hysterics. It's not exactly One Million Years B.C., but then it's perfectly suited for your next planned Halloween dino-monster movie marathon. Hey, it's a genuine cult film already & the price is right, so pop open those brewskies & enjoy! Also, viewers will find Don's book, ""Dinosaur Valley Girls - The Book"", about the making of the movie, highly entertaining."
1,"Without pinyin, this book is close to worthless","I have to admit great disappointment when I picked up the latest edition of the Mandarin Phrasebook. I've studied Chinese for about 2 years, but enjoyed the quick, portable convenience of LP's previous phrasebook editions. The removal of pinyin in this one, however, was idiotic. Pinyin is used on a great many things (signs, ads, street names, etc) in China, and can be decently understood by the time one's plane touches down. Only a few letters differ significantly from standard English speech. For me, and anyone else who is used to pinyin, it's a pointless hassle trying to decipher this book's non-standard pronounciation system."
4,Great travel companion,"This book is a great travel companion if you go to China and speak little mandarin. It saved me on numerous occasion (train station, shopping, restaurant); I like it so much that i bought the Italian and French one for other trips.I like the topics covered and having the characters, pinyin and english translation side by side is very convenient. I often pointed at a sign or a sentence to get some help. Tourist books vocabulary section are really useless for a weeklong trip.Quick note: the back cover states: USA 7.95$...a HAPPY TRAVELER"
2,Didn't fit my car like it said it would,"Bad because it said it would fit my car but when i got it, it was a complete different part. they should have images of the actual item but the delivery and return process went very smooth got my money back 3-4 days after i sent it back"
3,Read by someone else!!!!,"I have heard John Maxwell speak and find him and his ideas inspirational. I wanted to hear him speak again and so bought the audio CDs. Unfortunately, this series is read by a professional narrator who sounds right off a television advertisement. Perfectly modulated speech is as UNREAL as it gets. Although I'm listening to John Maxwell's ideas, I'm completely turned off by the narrator.I'll be much more careful next time I purchase one of his products. I paid for an audio CD to hear John Maxwell, not a delegated professional speaker. Reading it myself would have been less irritating and less costly. Mr. Maxwell, have you gotten too busy?"
2,Waste of Money...,They spent about 8 minutes and 8 bucks putting together this cheesy video. Production is not as good as some school video projects. There are two very bored people in the back who look like they don't want to be there. The 'person' in the front is a pretty boy in shorts made of tights material. They are extra tight to show off his little package that the camera man zooms in on from time to time. This guy is way to in love with himself. I might like this video if I was GAY.I gave it a whooping 2 stars... If you could tolerate watching it you will get a good workout.
4,Good workout!,"Both of these workout are really good. I've been doing them everyday for a week now and I can already see a difference. The leg segment is pretty easy, but the buns segment is really tough. I like this because it's fast and seems very effective. I would recommend this DVD, but I wish I had seen that you can get the DVD that also has the Abs and Arms all on one for just a few dollars more. I think I still might get the Abs and Arms DVD too, because I like the 8 minute time frame, it's good for adding onto other routines or doing them by themselves when you're in a hurry.The only thing I would say negative about this DVD is that the picture quality is not the best, it skips some and is definitely not DVD quality, but the price is good compared to other DVD's. Also, the man who instructs says ""come on gang"" a few too many times, but I can handle that. Other than those two complaints I say try these out, I think you'll like them."
4,"Cheesy, but great work out!",Once you look passed the cheesy instructor and the 90s haircuts and pay attention to the excercises... you'll get a wonderful work out!And it's great for people who have a busy day... just wake up a little early and dedicate 8 minutes of your life everyday to this DVD series and you'll start noticing the change within weeks!
2,overcharged on postage,"the item might be good. i haven't tried it yet.regardless, i was charged 17 euros for handling and postage. when the item arrived, it said $4.95 in postage on the envelope.so, he pocketed around 14 dollars for doing nothing."
4,i'm surprised!,i'm surprised that boa's albums are sold on amazon. i'm korean and boa is one of the most famous asian singer. i love 'flower' and 'moon and sunrise'. i'm completely surprised that some western people are aware of boa almost correctly. hmm.... she is releasing new album soon.
2,Not---Every Heart---Calibre!,"I love BoA but this is a valiant tribute to American R&B.; It's primarily mixes and samples of R&B; put together in a studio. Yes, she has a wonderful voice and yes, she is beautiful and yes, there are extra tracks; but I don't feel this work like I do with ""Every Heart"" and ""Duvet."" They tried to much to make her a super-star(she IS!) but this makes me doubt a four-star effort/I give it 3 stars max.Stick with your heart, BoA! This is not you...errr, but if this IS YOU, I won't buy your music again(*** lies) T_T. My copy has been played twice and is for sale.This was my first of BoA's label and it's a quality effort on her part and the producer/studio but I expected ""the other"" BoA.(This review has been updated.)"
1,cyrstal voices doth talks too much,"I found this cd to be very disappointing. I was looking forward to something meditative and soothing. What I heard was talk, talk and more talk and nothing was relaxing about it. Others might like it, but I for one did not and wish I could send it back for a full refund."
5,LOVE IT!,"This CD is beautiful! I am going to get the Sound of Light one too, I love listening to the Crystal Bowl, very relaxing! Both items came well packaged & in a timely fashion, smooth purchase:)"
1,"Waste of my money, my time, and a blank CD","""The Harmonic Vibrations of Crystal Singing Bowls"", one would think this CD consisted of (at least predominantly) the sounds of crystal bowls. It doesn't. This isn't the first time that resoundingly positive Amazon.com reviews have lured me down the wrong path. The guided meditation wasn't welcome, either, but at least it's a good one, and if it were the only departure, I would consider this a favorite, but then we come straight to the chants, at least they're called chants. To me, they're annoying humming and humming, and humming that seems to go on forever and became so stressful I turned the player off and put the CD on a shelf, too much hassle to return it, but I doubt I will ever play it again.Amazon.com is a great company, and I've never been disappointed with their service. The review process could still use a little work, though."
3,An OK Cd,I'm not fond of verbally-guided chakra meditations. The first cut is very monotonous. did not like this one as much as others I have purchased and used.
5,Very nice indeed,"I have listened to this twice. I haven't had the occasion (read: time) to actually go through the meditation with the vocalist, but the CD's music is very enjoyable."
4,Buyer beware,"If you're looking for an analysis on Russian and Soviet film after 1960 - stay away.This collection, by the (justly) renowned Jay Leyda, was published in 1960 and focuses primarily on 1860 - 1946, While the volume was updated later, it only includes a handful of new additions; Tarkovsky, Kalzatov, nor Shukshin are mentioned."
3,Disappointed,"Although the tree has a good number of lights, the branches are not full at all. No matter how many ornaments I add or how I arrange the branches you can still see the metal pole."
2,CHRISTMAS TREE,Tree beautiful but way too heavy! Put up and it fell over and could hardly pick it back up. Had a hard time dragging the box from one room to next. Had to send back.
2,Definitely not rust proof,"The locks are quite good in and of themselves. The mechanism works well and the pins that line up the locks are great. The only problem is that these are made of cheap metal that rusts on contact with water. If you are using them for a writing desk, no problem, but if you are using these for a dining table, as most of these locks are, then user beware. The first time someone spills liquid and it seeps between your table leaves to the lock, you will have to replace it, because it will rust shut. Go for something made of brass instead if you can find it."
5,Highly Inspirational,"Just saw a preview of this movie last night. It was fantastic. Just like the movie ""The Secret"", which it acknowledges for the concept of the Law of Attraction, this movie features little inspirational messages from people who are motivators and do-ers in our modern culture. It was fast paced, high energy and it left me with wanting to go out and achieving the success that i deserve and am capable of. Which I believe is a goal of the movie. I'd definitely recommend this movie."
2,It was ok but not inspiring to me at all.,"There is some good info but as someone who has watched ""The Secret"" at least 100 times I have watched this about twice. It did not inspire me.And I'm not one of those people that just try to manifest things without taking action (while that is possible and I have done it myself) as I also spend thousands of Dollars a year on marketing and business courses.Let's face it ""The Secret"" was one of a kind and I am referring to the Original version with Ester Hicks. I give it 5 stars and the Extended version falls to about 3 stars. There have been several movies modeled after it but none have captured the magic of 'The Secret""If you can rent it or you are a collector like me that buys all motivational DVD's because I'd rather watch them that TV shows that bombard me with Drug Company commercial and post hypnotic suggestions for illness get it but don't expect to be blown away!"
1,Disappointing,"After seeing The Secret I was excited to hear about this movie. I was under the false impression, though, that it was a sequel to The Secret. It isn't.For me, it seemed as though the production was lacking funds. The background seemed Star War-ish and cheesy. The interviews with the actors were more like quick sound bites. I gave this one away."
4,Pretty Intriguiging but gets very mathematical,"I found this a terrific read for the most part. The author REALLY wants the reader to get the whole Occams Razor concept and has tuned his beliefs toward that as his tool for self acceptance of it all. Its a compelling logic and may get even the most skeptical moon subject reader to tilt his head and say Hmmm. He goes a bit overboard with it at times with page after page and example after example - the book couldve been a little shorter. Then he gets mathematical then more mathematical then he expands on the matehmatics from earlier and before I know it Im reading an algebra textbook. Couldve done with a little less of that as well. But overall, a fascinating and well written book with a thorough and intriguing point of view on the moons origin and useage."
3,Take the good with the bad.,So the first two-thirds of the book are good and interesting and...light reading. Just stop before you get to the really weird last part and you will love it.
3,Just responding with an opinion.,The book was interesting for the most part. I could not agree with the conclusion as it sounded to sci-fi with no real evidence to support their assumptions.
1,A Fool And His Money........,"This book is unbelievably bad. It is so bad, it is hard to believe that the authors genuinely thought some of what they say is true. It is unbelievably badly researched, with many ""misunderstandings' of basic science and technical jargon. It strikes me more as an attempt to separate fools from their money."
1,Conspiracy,"If this book appeals to your sense of conspiracy theories, then consider that the publisher may well be passing along the identity of its gullible purchasers to dark forces."
4,"Interesting, but ends without a satisfactory explanation..","It was a good book, but the ending kind of slowed down and wasn't nearly as good as the first two thirds of it.. He ended up with this weird ""chicken and egg"" scenario that didn't quite wrap up his ideas in my opinion.His idea that man in the not too distant future could have developed a way to send massive machines back 4.6 billion years to take material from the young Earth, then build a moon from it in orbit, doesn't reconcile easily.If our moon, being the size it is and distance it is, was required for ""life"" to arise on Earth.. Then how did life come into being, and eventually allow humans to evolve, that would one day send machines back to build it? If the moon was required for life to happen, then there would be no man if there was no moon, since there would be no man to create the moon, since there was no moon?I know.. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it too. I am curious if the Moon might really be hollow though.."
1,You'd be better off watching the Discovery Channel,"Kudos to New Scientist magazine (May 6th) for tipping me off to the existence bit of pseudoscientific silliness. You'd be much better off renting (from Netflix) the Discovery Channel's ""If We Had No Moon"", which not only covers the most plausible explanations of how the moon was created but also its symbiosis with the development of life on Earth."
1,Do not buy this item,It is very difficult to attach it to anything. The straps are to short and under strange angel. My son did not play with it.
1,Worst toy I bought sofar,I am very disappointed by this toy as I taught that Baby Einstein stands for good quality. Overall the toy is pretty boring - my little one (5 months old) at least ignores it - and the classical music it plays has such a bad sound quality that it hurts.
4,Peter and the Wolf without annoying talk,"The previous review complains that the CD does not mention the fact that Peter and the Wolf is without narration. He must have not looked very closely. In the left hand corner, it clearly states ""without narration"". That is the main reason I bought it. The performance of Peter is simply amazing. The orchestral playing is as close to perfection as you will ever hear. Heard with narration, the music sounds trite. Without the talk, it is beautiful. And the recorded sound is outstanding, clear as a bell. The second Prokofiev work is the rarely played ""Tales of an old Granmother"". It is quite forgettable. The Saint-Saens Carnival of the Animals performance is several notches below Peter and the Wolf. Indeed, I found the performance to be on the flat side. However, at less than 5 dollars, and with a unique perspective of a highly familiar warhorse, this CD is still an excellent value. If you enjoy great orchestral playing, buy this CD before it is deleted."
4,Without Narration...,This disc is an inexpensive way to round out your basic 100 classics collection. The obscure Russian forces and the recording engineers provide a more than competent performance.For us mature listeners this version is done without the usual child oriented narration. One can sit back and appreciate the wittiness and novelty of both scores.
2,Poor buying information,"I purchased this album for my grandson. He enjoys instrumental rather than vocal music. I am sure he will love this but, since it is an introduction to orchestral music for him, I really wanted the narrated version. The buying information does not specify that this is WITHOUT NARRATION. I almost sent it back, but will keep it for the Carnival of the Animals. And I will order a version of Peter & the Wolf that specifies it IS narrated. Maybe that was reason it was not specified on this one?"
5,"An ideal, highly recommended title for novice developers.","In Understanding The Network: A Practical Guide To Internetworking, UNIX/NT network administrator Michael Martin serves up real-world examples and practical advice on the fundamentals of professional networking. Each chapter builds on the previous one so that by the concluded chapter the reader will clearly understand everything necessary to build and manage a multiprotocol local or wide area computer network, as well as have a solid foundational understanding of the technical material needed to continue study towards a Cisco CCNA, CCNP, or CCIE. Understanding The Network is a highly recommended instructional work for novice network developers and has much of informative value for the more experienced networking professional as well."
5,"Excellent ""networking"" book so far!","I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to networking concepts. Though, you should have some basic computer literacy (DOS, software & hardware, etc...). And the price is not too bad."
3,"Reasonable value, but","The color is darker than pictured--closer to maple or cherry than oak--and the instructions are diagram only, so not neccessarily clear to everyone. As well, the middle shelf support does have a specific top and bottom which is not labeled--my dad and I had to partially disassemble it so that we could make the shelves even! The positives, I guess, would be that it does provide a reasonable storage space, could fit in with a variety of decor, and appears reasonably sturdy once assembled. Also, it's easy to adjust the shelves to several heights to accomodate VHS tapes as well as CDs or DVDs."
3,Phoenix Rising- by John J. Nance,"This book was an average Nance book, not bad, not good. I enjoyed many of the flight scenes, especially the 767 stuck above the Artic Circle, but the novel at some parts felt too much like an investigative novel, or a mystery. At the end, the novel seems to end abruptly. It was a dissapointing end, but if you are an aviation insider, it may provide a better read than an outsider would have."
1,do not buy - not even worth 1 star,no listing of song titles3 cds - but only 36 songs TOTALtwo dollars a songripoffdonotbuythanks
2,No song titles!!,No listing of song titles should have been a dead giveaway that it was filled with throw-away music!
5,A Must See For Any George Best Fan!,"As a fan of George Best, I love this DVD. It contains amazing footage of some of his most incredible goals including from his very early career with Manchester United. In addition, it includes up close and personal interviews with Best himself, his father, his second wife Alex and some of his fellow players and long-time friends. The extras include Best's ""50 best goals,"" more interview with Alex Best and George's opinion of the current Manchester United team (as of the time this DVD was made). My husband (who is from Belfast and grew up watching George Best play) and I have watched it several times and we still really enjoy it."
4,Nice looking sunglasses,"I was worried when I ordered these glasses online without trying them on first because I have a large head and most glasses don't fit very well. I was pleasantly surprised when they came as they fit perfectly! The one drawback about the lenses however, is that when you look down, you can kinda see a reflection of the lens which messes with your vision. I got the Polarized Axis lenses so I don't know if it would be different with another type of lens. Overall, I like the way the glasses look on me and they are a good fit, I might just try a different lens if I bought another pair."
3,Pikachu is the best,"OK what be honest here for a min. I've never seen all of pokemon before. But I have to say that it the best show for kids today. With Ash the hero of the show and his mouse-like pokemon pikachu. In the first epoidsoe is Ash uses pikachu to win a ThunderBadge, Pikachu must defeat its evolved form, Raichu!( who a lot stronger then he) It's a clash of lightning and the winner we come out on top. In the next one Ash, Misty and Brock embark on a pleasure cruise aboard the St. Anne accompanied by other Pokemon and their trainers. I to say that the St. Anne isn't as good as the first one. That why I gave it a three."
2,Value?!?,"I recall reading the series a very long time ago when Dave was fresh on the book shelves. And I recall their being true value in the price for the reward. But had Amazon's pricing been the fact back then (even adjusting for inflation), I would never have experienced the wonder and joy of the series.So while I recommend the books, I recommend shopping around for them. $20 paperback; $10 ebook; should be $6 for either. Then I would repurchase the ebook so I could read them all over again (did I say it was a long time ago?)."
5,Beginning of an all-time favorite series,"This book begins the ""A Man of His Word"" series, which is among my all-time favorite fantasy reads. This series got me interested in Dave Duncan's other books (King's Blades, etc.), many of which are good but none quite match this series. If you're a fan of authors like David Eddings or Anne McAffrey, I highly recommend this book."
5,Well paced start to a series,A good start to the series and while the beginning may lend you to believe you can predict the story there are some twists that I didn't see coming. It feels similar to against the light with multiple stories coming together at the end.
2,Nice CD-but several songs skipped,"Really enjoyed this CD till the songs began skipping. Cleaned my player in case it was my error, cleaned the (brand new) CD & popped it back in, only to find that it still skipped on several of the songs. Too bad"
5,Original songs with top notch arrangements and improvisation,"Doug Robinson is a new and original voice in Jazz today. His versatility as a performer along with his talent at composing and arranging make this a must have album for any serious Jazz fan. He has put together an amazing group of musicians and created one of the most satisfying CD's in recent memory. His tribute to mentor and friend, the late Frank Rehak, is worth the price of the CD alone."
1,pompous puffery,"Wangerin's pretentious, pompous prose ruins this book. I'm surprised the Jesuit magazine ""America"" recommended it."
4,"Great addition for the race car, would not recommend for daily driver",This water pump drive was very easy to install. Works great on the race car. I have it wired to run after the car is shut off to cool it off after the quick trip down the track. I would not recommend this on a daily driver. I don't think it would be enought for stop and go traffic on a hot day.
4,"Ooooh, my aching abs!","First a caveat: I have never purchased an exercise video. I'm reasonably young, healthy and fit. But with two little kids, finding time to exercise got harder, so I broke down and bought 8 Minute Abs & Arms (based largely on reviews read here).I must say, I'm very pleased with the video. It's easy to do, it's very fast, and it makes a point of providing access to the exercise for beginners, intermediates and advanced fitness freaks. The production value is similar to that of a low-budget adult film, but that's the only negative thing I can say about it.Best of all, I can see and feel results. After about 10 days, I notice a more toned look in my gut (and, surprisingly, in my neck). And I feel that familiar soreness that comes after a good workout. That, to me, says it all."
2,For Me this was a Waste of Money,"They spent about 8 minutes and 8 bucks putting together this cheesy video. Production is not as good as some school video projects. There are two very bored people in the back who look like they don't want to be there. The 'person' in the front is a pretty boy in shorts made of tights material. They are extra tight to show off his little package that the camera man zooms in on from time to time. This guy is way to in love with himself. I might like this video if I was ....I gave it a whooping 2 stars... If you could tolerate watching it, you could get a good workout."
5,Bragging rights,"I've been doing this workout for several years now. The most amazing part about this video is how it has been carefully designed to change up which part of your abs you target with each variation. If you keep pace with the instructor, you will be doing about 20 crunches with each variation. By the time you've finished the 8 minutes, you've chalked up over 200 crunches. I agree with some reviews here, mostly for those interested in toning, but it is fun bragging about those 200+ crunches I do every day! Highly recommended."
4,"Good workout, cheesy music","This Workout really does work your arms & abs pretty well. You can make any of the exercises more difficult by adding more weight or more reps. The instructor doesn't count reps and encourages you to do what you can in the time limit for each exercise.The music in this workout is incredibly cheesy & the instuctor keeps calling you ""gang"". It's a little irritating, but you don't notice it as much when you are working hard. Overall I think it's a good workout to own."
4,great body if you stick to it,I like the video because it is short and sweet. It targets the right areas and does what it promises. But you have to stick to it to get results.
5,A perfect time-saving workout,"I read loads of fitness magazines & each month they come up with some new excercises that are more time-saving, but this DVD, I found absolutely the best in helping me keep up with my fitness schedule. I've kept it up for 3 weeks & now I'm in my 4th week & still going... Truly a workout for everyone!!! And its tough if you don't pause between workouts"
4,Good workout,"I love these 8-minute workouts! I have both the buns/legs and arms/abs DVD. There's really nothing WOW or super fancy here -- these are just honest-to-goodness workouts. It's super easy to squeeze in one or two 8 minute sessions in the morning before work plus they really do seem to be effective. Best of all the people aren't annoying or boring. One thing that's really cool is that there is no counting -- they tally reps by time (eg: 30 seconds doing this, 1 minute doing that, etc.)."
4,You'll love it,"I've been doing the ab workout almost every day for over a month, and although I don't have a six-pack yet I'm noticing a difference. For the first 2 weeks I couldn't get through it without stopping, but now I can get through it all. It's basic, you feel it, the music is bad the clothes are dreadful and I love it."
