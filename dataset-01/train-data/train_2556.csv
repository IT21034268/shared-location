1,Misses the Point,"Stan Allen is one of the self-styled theorists who see architecture and urbanism as an abstract set of geometries, Allen fails to understand that most cities are living organisms and that relationships and form are pointless without comprehending the viltal, human function. Anyone who has experienced the great urban spaces of Italy or Paris will know that urban design is not a graphic exercise. Allen's lacks the mental facility to adress this component of design and his diagrams are more ignorant that one can imagine. This book is rubbish of the very worst sort. - Recommend you read Jane Jacobs 'Life and Death of Great American Cities' instead."
4,Amazing!,"I never realized how much refugees had to go through to become Canadian citizens. I also never realized how much the government does to prevent people from coming here. This book is insightful and interesting, one of the greatest reads I've had all year."
1,Celestron Omni 15mm Plossl,"I ordered two of the Celestron Omni 15mm Plossls along with two Celestron Omni 12mm Plossls for use in a Binoviewer.The field stop in an eyepiece is the component that gives the edge of the field a crisp black border. I have had 30 or more different Plossls over the last 15 years from a variety of manufacturers, and ALL of them had field stops.The Celestron Omni 15mm Plossls oddly did NOT have field stops and this gave a very poorly defined edge of field. The Celestron Omni 12mm Plossls that I ordered at the same time DID have field stops.I honestly do not know if this was a defective batch or if they are supposed to be this way. I returned them as defective though because as I mentioned, having owned at lest 30 Plossls over the last 15 years, this was the only pair that I have ever owned that did NOT have a field stop, and I think that it was a manufacturing defect in this entire lot."
5,A Valuable Extension To The Little Schemer,"The book picks up and demonstrates using to letcc (call with current continuation) to speed up delivery of results or to simply forget pending applications and return to an outer list of s-expressions. Additionally there is more using of letrec and the demonstration of of using set!. The final chapter once again looks at creating the language within the language but this time including 'define' and using set! to update closures. If you felt reasonably confident with the Little Schemer you should be fine reading this extension book, and you will likely be much more confident with any lisp like languages having read it."
5,introduces the rest of scheme (almost),"The Seasoned Schemer continues where the Little Schemer left off introducing local variables via let and it's variations including letrec. Set!, the syntax for changing a variables value is introduced. Continuations, as used for escaping from an computation and for going back to previous position in code are also introduced. There are less references to the accomplishments of famous computer scientists in this book than in the Little Schemer which I found to be disappointing. However, I greatly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting to increase their understanding of the Scheme programming language. Although scheme's vector data type is not introduced, I think you will have enough of an understanding of Scheme after reading this book to make substantial programs."
2,Fishes?,"Silence! stir not! for a whisperWould affright thy pretty prey;Not a motion, little lisper,Else the fish will glide away."
1,Ordered 6 and all failed to work,"Using the scroll wheel or right click would lock up the mouse every time. tried all 6 that I ordered, all failed.they want money in order to return the mice"
5,Wonderful book for your play therapy needs!,"The book had a wonderful format that made it easy to read. When chosing a technique, I felt like she provided all the infomation I needed to make the intervention successful. I loved seeing the pictures. Being the visual learner that I am, I was able to see the idea she had in mind when she created the technique. There are a wide variety of topics covered from assessment to anger management. Overall, the book was very creative and enjoyable to read. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves play therapy and is wanting to add a great book to their collection."
2,Much passion but historically slanted,"I must say I was very disappointed in this book. It is no doubt written with much passion but that same passion obscures historical accuracy. The book lacks historical fact to backup what in my opinion is a clear editorial slant. There are very few footnotes to accompany the many statements that appear to be stated as facts. The book is in my opinion clearly anti-haole and glosses over the dark side of native Hawaiian history. A reader of history should be able to read an accurate account of events and then make up their own minds, not have it made up for them. This of course is true of many ""accounts"" of history and the reader must always be on guard for overt editorial leanings. There are clearly books of Hawaiian history including text books which are just as guilty and have slanted the true history of Hawaii that obscures the many wrongs done to the native people. My view is of neither rather of a need for an accurate account of history."
4,"Wonderful story, gone too quickly","Syberia is a wonderful game. The plot is fantastic, the graphics are beautiful, and the music is great. Unfortunately, it is also short. It seems that just as you are settling into the familiarity of your journey it comes to an end, and you are sad to see it go.If you've played The Longest Journey and are looking for something similar, I strongly recomend Syberia. Like The Longest Journey, the game is filled with memorable charcters, interesting locations, all tied together by an engrossing story.One last note: The puzzles in this game are very much secondary, story was quite obviously what the developers were interested in. Few will have any real difficulty completing it, but the game is enjoyable none the less."
3,Potentially great but doesn't deliver,"This game has a very interesting premise, nice graphics, and potentially interesting characters. I would recommend this for gamers like myself who are starved for good adventure games, but don't expect to be thrilled. It is very frustrating for a game to have this much potential and then not deliver. Once the premise is introduced there is nothing but puzzles to solve in order to find the lost heir. The cell phone plot adds very little to the story, and Kate doesn't seem to be much more grown up than when she began her journey. The locations are beautiful and creative, and I loved journeying from one place to another, but was dissatisfied at the end when the story finally started going somewhere. Overall, a decent game that should satisfy your craving for adventure for a few hours."
2,Over-rated Adventure with few redeeming features,"I read many glowing reviews on this game, supplied by online sources, but recently found out that a lot of the reviewers didn't actually play the game, and were parroting what someone said. SO the commerical reviews tend to be all very similar. After playing just an hour of this game, it bored me to death but I still ploughed on with it, and at times found myelf falling asleep. The game is very slow, the characters flat, and the story is uninteresting. The writer of this game tried to induce some sympathy for Kates character but in my opinion it makes me hate her even more. Kates character movement is rubbish...she manages to walk and run, but when it comes to going up or down stairs, she moves like a 70 year old. The game is very poor, and should not be compared to The Longest Journey as it falls well short of that."
4,An artistic triumph,"One of the most visually stylistic, artfully rendered games ever created seems to come from a man that doesen't neccesarily excell at what he does..Sokal has the heart of a director, be it video games, film, or life...His vision of the games locals and angles they are presented through shows his professional eye for composition and cinematography..It is for these virtues that Syberia exceeds expectations of traditional adventure games and hoists itself into the realm of high art. More developers in the gaming industry should take notice of the importance of vision and style acredited to this game"
4,Syberia,"I enjoy this type of PC game. Like Myst and its sequals, I prefer solving puzzles and something wiht a story line throughout the game. And this game takes the player from start to a fun conclusion."
5,One of the Few Adventure Games Actually Worth Playing!,"I own many adventure games, but 99% of the time I don't bother to complete them or play them beyond an hour or two. Syberia, however, was an exception. This game is beautiful and intriguing. You really do sort of get caught up in Kate Walker's journey. The locations are very interesting and the puzzles are not that difficult. Very memorable characters, too. The musical soundtrack is also very high-quality and adds to the game immensely. Highly recommended. I have yet to buy and play Syberia 2, but I'm sure it will be just as awesome and great as the first one was. One other note -- the premise in Syberia is definitely not realistic. Just thought I'd mention that in case folks were expecting a realistic-style adventure -- something that COULD actually happen in real life. Great game! Go buy it, play it, and live it!"
5,"Amazing, Enchanting, Captivating, and even MOVING","I've played most every game. I am a 50 year old man. I am not some impressionable idiot. And let me tell you something--this game is one of the most entrancing, beautiful, artistic, moving, and involving games I've ever had the pleasure to encounter AND I was able to give it happily to my 10 year old niece and know she'll be just as enchanted. It does get a little wordy at times, but wow--the art, the concept, the plays-fair-with-you-instead-of-cheating-like-most-games puzzles. This has EVERYthing. Get it. Treasure it. I can't wait for the sequel."
1,Many technical problems,I have not been able to play most of the game due to tech problems--Have not been able to save games so have always had to restart game. If problems could be worked out it looks like a fairly good game.
4,Wonderful Game to Play,"Good adventure game. Graphics are fantastic. I was only disapointed that the game ended. Would have loved to have had more game time, seemed a little short. (I guess I was spoiled from Longest Journey)Definately worth playing."
3,"Good premise, poor execution","I really liked the premise of this game. I am not a videogame afficionado, I have only played a ""Monkey Island"" game before this, so admittedly I don't have a lot to compare it to. I like logic puzzles and good stories. This game had lots of puzzles, some of which weren't too logical, but I could overlook that with some online help. The scenery was great! Unfortunately that wasn't enough to make me overlook the very unexpected letdown of an ending and the wimpy female characterization, as well as the trite script and uneven emotional tone in the conversations. I was really expecting a lot from this game based on the synopsis, and the game delivered in scenery, but fell a little short in characterization and storyline."
2,A frustrating waste of time,"Where do I begin? The graphics are not too terrific, the storyline is extremely boring, the acting is horrific, the puzzles require no more logic than running around helter skelter asking everyone every stupid question on your list only to be overwhelmed by time filling blabber! What else?So I suppose if you're excited by mind numbing prattle, laundry lists of tasks to perform, and no brain twisting puzzles with logic, go ahead----enjoy. Personally, my time is best served reading a good book or out exercising my real body rather than my virtual one. BTW, if I hear one more clomp clomp clomp or clank clank clank of her steps I'll have to shoot myself!I will not be purchasing Syberia II."
2,A major disappointment,"The Broken Sword series marked my entry into the adventure game genre, for as a mostly console gamer, I ignored a large number of classic PC titles. Those games, and The Longest Journey got me hooked, and so I thought I'd check out Syberia which seemed to offer much of the same formula.But that common formula of obscure puzzles and pre-rendered backgrounds was about all that Syberia had shared with those classics. The game's plot - which in all adventure games is the make-or-break factor - is completely underwhelming. Perhaps it is unfair to compare Syberia to Broken Sword or TLJ instead of evaluating it independently, but there is really very little substance to this game no matter how you look at it.In fact, it is only by virtue of a storyline that adventure games' often frustrating mechanics and obscure puzzle solutions are even tolerable. Without a story, an adventure game - much like Syberia - is quite unfulfilling."
4,"Nice graphics, okay gameplay","I think the previous reviews have said it all, but it couldn't hurt to hear it from another person. The graphics are very nice in this game. The muted palette and European setting make for some very beautiful backdrops.Remove that element, however, and you're left with only an average adventure game. In the current state of adventure games, though, you have to take what you can get. With the mechanical element present in this game, the ""puzzle potential"" was very high, but it just doesn't live up to what it could have been. Most puzzles can be solved by located an item on the same screen or an adjacent screen, and little thought it required.The story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure how much replayability you're looking at with this one. I'd certainly recommend this game to any adventure game fan that feels left out in the PC gaming world in the last 5 years. Thinking about it just makes me miss the Curse of Monkey Island all the more."
5,5 Stars--Not enough,"full of surprising experience,though it's 2D,but better than most of the 3D games."
2,"Slow, enjoying, yet still somehow dull","The game is beautiful. This is easy to see from the opening scenes, and the first steps of gameplay. However, the movements become slow, and the puzzles pointlessly boring. And though the game claims to be an adventure game, it still lacks ANY action at all. What happened? Didn't someone working on the project, stop and say ""This game may play in 8-10 hours, but it feels like an eternity"".This game would best be displayed as art, on a wall monitor in a millionaire's home. The graphics were nothing short of beautiful, but the gameplay, and focus both took the backseat. Find something else to play."
4,fun but not captivating,"The story line started off decently, but began to fade near the end. I felt the ending could have been much better. The automatons were cute and dialogue decent. It is a decent game to play on a rainy day or if your snowed in. The use of only the mouse for game play was a first for me. I am definitely a hard- core keyboard fan. Graphics in the game I must admit were very well done. I think a beginning gamer would have fun playing this game, but if you are a serious gamer try something like, ""Alice""or ""Undying."""
5,Great game,"I played a demo of this game a long time ago and when I got bored with my current games I started looking for a new one and ran across this again. I got it and really like it. It's charming and original. Great if you aren't in the mood for something high action. You can just work your way through it discovering all sorts of interesting things that spark the imagination. I particularly like the industrial/european/steam punk mood. Requires patience, but that's not really a bad thing. If you like to breeze through games without much thought or effort then you will probably hate this game."
5,THIS IS THE BEST,"This game is what got me started with Adventure games. It is the BEST. I loved it & I also loved Syberia II. The creators did an amazing job & I would love it if they had made more like this. Very ""french"" in the rendering of their environments, which is not bad, because overall, this game is a great adventure."
4,fun with my daughter,"I wanted to add a review from a different perspective. I am always on the look out for adventure games that I can enjoy with my daughter. This requires several things, like a person that can be seen, lively interaction with other characters, fun but not too complex puzzles, interesting scenery and story line. I found all the above in this game. It may not be the best in the world, but the story line and game play gave my daughter and I lots of fun times, and kept her excited and involved. The same can be said for Syberia II."
5,awesome game,"I've only played a handful of adventure games, and this is my favorite. I'm someone who really likes the story, graphics, and music to be top-notch so that I get so absorbed that I want to keep going further. This game definitely delivered on all of these. I'd highly recommend this and its sequel to other people who are just starting to look into adventure games or dabble in them for fun. Some have complained about the game being too simplistic, but I found it to be complex enough that I didn't mind getting hints. In general, I'm looking for more of a fun escape than a challenge - I get enough challenges through work."
2,The Longest Journey is still Number ONE!!!,"Well, the graphics are beautiful and better than TLJ but that's about it.Syberia had a good story at the start. However, it failed to develop the storylike in TLJ. The many characters in the Syberia were not interesting but rather annoying.The worst is the Ending...Anyway, if u have never played The Longest Journey, you may not know what I am talking about."
1,Waste of Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Syberia... a great game, full of amazing scenery, brain-jingling puzzles, and many fun adventures... NOT! Syberia, the so-called "" Top notch adventure game"" is not what you think. I have played this game with one of my relatives, and before I played it I thought "" wow! This is going to be fun to play!""...Later on I regretted that thought... sigh... If any of you game players want to play Syberia, you must have the patience and an IQ of at least 1 (which I am sure you already have). This game was a waste of money, and the reviews for this game were DEFINETLY not helpful at all to me. (hint: Don't buy this!)"
2,"Gorgeous, but not very fun.","Syberia is a textbook case for beauty in games, but its gameplay really leaves a lot to be desired. Not only is the game over too soon, but it is FAR too easy and the puzzles are boring. The characters are fine, but the attempted development and maturation of the main character, Kate Walker, really was not particularly well-done.The game's main problem is that the point-and-click interface just really doesn't work out in this case. The screens are too expansive and Kate too small and slow (running or not) to keep the gameplay interesting, and, again, the puzzles are just not particularly thought-provoking.None of this changes the fact, though, that you will want to explore this beautiful world simply for the reward of seeing everything. It's just too bad the gameplay didn't reach the bar the graphical design raised."
2,The Longest Journey is still Number ONE!!!,"I can't believe there are people who think that Syberia isbetter than The Longest Journey. It does not even come close!!!Well, the graphics are beautiful and better than TLJ but that's about it.Syberia had a good story at the start. However, it failed to develop the storylike in TLJ. The many characters in the Syberia were not interesting but rather annoying.The worst is the Ending; I could have come up with a better one, seriously.Anyway, if u have never played The Longest Journey, you may not know what I am talking about. So do yourself a favor and GET TLJ instead of Syberia. And to the people who already owned the Syberia, get TLJ and paly it; u will see for youself why THE LONGEST JOURNEY IS STILL NUMBER ONE."
2,Dull,"The graphics are not great despite what people keep saying here. The Myst and Riven graphics blow this one away...Remember Myst3 and how poor the graphics were in comparison to Myst and Riven? This game is on par with Myst3.The plot is boring and is not aided by the script that must have been written by a 6th grader (sorry - no offense to all you 6th graders out there). I was ready to strangle the retarded kid after only 2 encounters...and the robot man is equally insipid and annoying. The heroine is also pathetic when on the phone kissing-up/whining to her boyfriend.If you enjoy spending hours wandering around aimlessly and pointlessly, get this game... otherwise spend your hard-earned dough elsewhere."
3,"a bit slow, but pretty","After playing all the Nancy Drew games (which I highly recommend) I tried this game on a recommendation. The graphics are beautiful, the music haunting, but sometimes there is tooooo much dialogue (left click to skip thru it) and what I find most annoying is the constant going back and forth, tedious. Why games can't have a map overview, where you can click and are instantly there, would save tons of time. Not as many puzzles as a Nancy Drew game and don't have to refer to walk thru as much as a Nancy Drew game. If you have a patience problem, this game is not for you."
1,The people move in real slow motion.,"I cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion. It's terrible. It takes her a minute to ""run"" across the room which is not very big at all.I don't know what's wrong with this game but I know it's not my computer. There are 3 different ways to install it and I've tried all 3. I tried changing the setting and everything. I cannot get it to play right. I would not recommend this game."
1,What a painful waste of time!,"I don't understand how this game gets good reviews. The dialogue is horrible, the characters are unlikeable, and the action is boring. I wish I'd steered clear of this one."
1,Too much hype,"Where did all the great ratings come from? Did they actually play Syberia? I found this game a true yawner - over simplistic and dull. I paid 20 dollars, might as well finish it type of game. It should have been named Almost Syberia since you never actually get there without buying the sequel. I now need my own wind up key for a train to oblivian since this game drove me mad.I believe the Adventure Game developers need to quit wasting their time along with ours and come out with a real 'adventure' game. A game with great graphics, great interaction and mind boggling puzzles (without the use of hint/cheats). I'll pay the extra 10-20 dollars for it!"
2,Oy!,"Siberia is one of the most dissapointing games me and my mom have ever played before. Although the graphics were ok, they story seemed to have not been worked on properly and thoroughly. There are puzzles everywhere, and many of them you have to do for no entire reason. If you ever want to try this game, make sure that you have the patience to finish it."
5,14 Days of Adventure,"Just finished this game. It took me a couple of weeks of everyday playing to finish it. Once I figured out most of the solutions to the hard puzzles were in the same area, it helped to solve the tougher ones, other times I had to use the book to figure them out and would not have been able to find the solutions without the guide. The storyline was very good and I loved the ending. The music and settings were beautiful. It was definitely entertaining. Very enjoyable to play. Hints: I missed the book in the library about mushrooms so I couldn't pick up the elixir. Preparing the drink at the bar was impossible without the solution."
5,Timeless Masterpiece,The story and graphics are amazing in the point & click adventure. You will fall in love with the French village that Kate Walker has found herself in.
4,BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS AND GREAT CHALLENGES,I'm not a shoot em up kind of game player and I loved this game even though I wasn't going to get it after trying the Demo. The graphics are truly amazing and movement is fairly easy. I like using the mouse to move around and this was very easy. The game only choked on me once and I have XP. The challenges and puzzles were not too terribly hard and they made sense. I was able to get through it fairly good without having to cheat and look at a walkthrough! The constant cell phone calls though from friends was a bit annoying but other than that - GREAT GAME and can't wait for the sequel!
4,fairly easy adventure game,"I enjoyed playing this game because the story was interesting, but the puzzles themselves were not much of a challenge (even though I did get stuck a few times).The puzzles were completely plot driven. The graphics were beautiful. The only criticism was that there was no way to get to places that you had already visited, so there was a lot of watching the heroine walk (or run) through scenes over and over, back and forth, which got old. Fairly good length for playing time."
5,"Serious fun, but be careful!","This game is highly entertaining. You will never want to stop playing it until you finsish it. I reccomend it to everyone. The graphics are one of a kind and the story line keeps you interested. The characters are engaging and the different scenery is stunning! The cut scenes are also magnificent. Unfortunately for some, this game has an epilepsy warning just so you know. But other than that, you should definitely spend the money and play. I'm sure it's just as fun the second and third times around!"
3,Disappointing,"Kate acts totally uneducated, considering she is supposed to be a lawyer. The ending was a BIG disappointment. I think they want us to purchase the other half of the story in another game. Not me!!!"
2,Didn't live up to the hype,Great graphics.Sadly lacking in puzzles. Basically just a walk through. The ending just fizzles out. Certainly not in the same catagory as Myst.
2,A Little Disappointing for Me,"I have enjoyed adventure games in the past, in particular Lucas Arts titles like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. The positive on this game is that it is beautifully illustrated. But the puzzles and rather simpleminded. The story line is fairly interesting, but it also seems to be striving to present some political correctness. Your character is young women who is an attorney. I think the creators are trying to make you think of your character as becoming more independent as the story goes along, but this is done mostly through conversations you have on your cell phone with your Mom and your boyfriend, neither of whom do you actually meet in the game. Also I expect more from the music of such an artistic game. Having said all that, I probably will buy the sequel that is planned."
5,Great Holster keep my Motorazor V3t in place.,"Nice holster,looks and holds phone secure.Very good price for a holster that last long."
5,Best 3D Blue Ray DVD in my library,"My family was amazed with the 3D effects that were included. We saw this in 3D at the movies and were impressed, but seeing it on my 3D tv with the active 3D glasses was better than the movie theater."
3,"Well, Zoe Saldana is hot!","And the really interesting thing about Avatar is that it's cut and paste movie making. I spotted core themes to the following films: Dances with Wolves, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter (all of them), Gone With The Wind, Wizard of Oz, Braveheart, 2001, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now and Kundun. The only one Cameron left out was ET. Spielberg should feel slighted. Not sure if you were ever a fan, but the sets looked like they were conceived by Roger Dean who did all the YES album covers. And the music sounds like orchestral versions of Yes tunes. Jon Anderson should sue.The technology is impressive, but I enjoyed Bono in 3D more. He looked like Darby O'Gill and the little People dancing on my knees. I kept swatting 3d bugs away at Avatar. If I wanted that, I'd go to New Jersey."
3,White people save the world again!,"Once again, a movie where white people seek to destroy the exotic ""other"" out of greed and it is up to the white people to save them.Instead of Native Americans (Dances With Wolves), Asians (The Last Samurai), Africans (Blood Diamond) or African Americans (Freedom Writers, Dangerous Minds and similar ilk) we now have the Na'vi, CGI blue people living in Cameron's idealized Eden.Non-memorable dialogue, a predictable plot and characters in full stereotype.BUT...the special effects are incredible. Watch it for the visual stimuli but we've seen this all before."
3,Movie Too Long,"The movie is too long for the story. The story is just another Cowboys vs Indians movie (aka a copy of Dances With Wolves). The animation is good looking but it doesn't look real. It looks like a fancy cartoon. District 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Terminator Salvation look much much better as far as the visual goes.Avatar is a big budget movie; but nothing special as a movie. 3 stars from me."
1,Not in 3D,"Ok. 1. it is not in 3D2. It does not have extra footage.3. looks bare-bones.4. Company needs to make more money with the special edition, director's cut, 3d version etc. I guess $2.3B is not enough.I will wait."
3,I cried...,"...when I saw in the news how popular this movie is. Recall the scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off where the matre d' looks at Ferris and his friends, shakes his head, and says ""I weep for the future;"" that's how I feel when I think that this is what passes for excellence in film-making now. It's not that there isn't anything likable about this movie, the visuals are stunning. But the dialog is incredibly corny and the plot is unoriginal ('Dances with Toruk' is a more honest name for the movie). A person who is being honest with themselves cannot look me in the face and say that this movie is a good movie. For a movie to truly be good it cannot rely solely on special effects, no matter how great those effects are."
1,Let's Go Humans,"James Cameron ought to get a one-way ticket to the planet of blue idiots whom he seems to love so much. Typical Demo Rat blather about mankind's terrible ways and how great the native peoples are.A visually stimulating movie ruined by a puerile liberal message. Plot was mundane and the acting not much to speak of.Yeah, right, a bunch of savages defeats a mega-capitalistic universe jumping civilization. Plausible James. And Titantic sucked too."
5,woww!! Fantastic film,"Avatar is absolutely the best movie on blueRay I have ever seen. Its easy to forget you are not really there when you are viewing it on a 58 inch screen. We have watched it a couple of times now and will again I'm sure. The movie is a really good movie and has values to learn from. The photography and special effects are fantastic. I can't say enough about how good it is and how much we enjoyed and would highly recommend to anyone and have. Enjoy, you won't be sorry!!!Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]"
2,Environmental crap but looks good,"So many references to the liberal agenda. Poor defenseless jungle people (Iraq), big bad army comes in to destroy them and their forest home. (Environmental wackos)The effects were awesome but there seemed to be a liberal message."
2,Avatar Two Disc Blue-ray,"Got a bad Disc on the Blu-ray copy. Only played have-way, then skipped to the end. First half played great!"
1,No special features,"This movie has gorgeous special effects and looks great on Blu-ray, but I'm very disappointed that this version has absolutely no special features...no director's commentary, no behind the scenes footage, no interviews. I wish we had read the reviews before buying. I would have waited for the next version."
2,WAIT FOR 3D VERSION!!!!,Marketing strategic to start with the non 3D version as a start to then force to re-buy but the 3D version... WAIT
1,Very Bad Product Quality,"If you were wondering why a $55 disc is sold here for $25, wonder no more. It does not play in most players. After spending almost two hours finding a thumb drive, updating the BD firmware, it just wouldnt load. I am guessing that you have to pay up the wazoo for an expensive BD player that would play this. I have a Samsung BD-C5500 and this is the only BD I have had problems with. I tried it in my friends Pioneer Elite BDP-23FD and it played wonderfully. Never mind that the Pioneer costs $400 more than my Samsung. So if you have a new (less than a year) BD player and paide $400+ for it, go ahead and buy this piece of worthless..."
1,yawn...........,"How many times can you regurgitate the same movie? Like many have said the movie was a visual feast but if you already have the 3-d version then this is going to be nothing new except they put it in a new package and added the words ""Collector's Edition"". Then add a new extra or two.I can wait for the extended version."
3,its perfect movie but the dvd is simply not clear enough,"its perfect movie but the dvd is simply not clear enough (i just played it with my laptop).besides this, the subtitles of the dvd are silly, they are sooo big and just don't let me watch the movie in normal way."
4,"OK Movie, Great Picture Quality!","The plot of the story is just ok, but the Picture Quality is simply the best i have witnessed on my TV. It is worth getting if you want to show off your TV and Blu-ray player to friends when they come over. it will knock their socks off!!"
3,It's Avatar - what can you say,"Movie is great, Beautiful collection -only thing I did not like is that the movie is split on two discs!!! They should have put the versions on different disks instead of splitting it up like that... I really hate having to change disks in the middle of my movie!"
3,"Climax, anticlimax","After all the build-up, fantastic sequences and special effects, the climax around the tree was an anticlimax. I could have made it better..."
3,Blu-ray does not play on Samsung,This Avatar blu-ray does not play on Samsung BD-C6500 players even with their new updated firmware 1010.4 installed. Samsung is very slow in responding to Fox's new copy protection. I purchased this DVD along with the Samsung player and it did not play right out of the box. Give me a break all I won't to do is relax and watch a movie. I am very disapointed in blu-ray technology in general. Blu-ray has been out there for some years now and it still does not work 100%. I can not wait for the class action lawsuite to start. I will be joining in on this one because I am tired of software and firmware updates all the time on brand new products that I purchase. There needs to be a law against this.
2,NO SPECIAL FEATURES? NOT EVEN A DIGI COPY? That's bull crap!,Seriously... I think it's bull that they do this.Release the movie and then re-release it to get people to buy it a second time.Just wait for the special features DVD pack when it comes out in less than a year.Unless you're a complete movie freak like me... wait and buy it later.I just hope they don't release 16 different versions of it on DVD like they did with Star Wars. I have like 6 trilogies already! What a rip off!
5,Another world,"Got this movie because it came with a DVD & Blue-Ray. Plus the fact that I heard it was awesome & it was. My girlfriend who isn't into movies much because she falls asleep, could not blink her eyes for fear she may miss something. Great family movie. Love the colors. Have watched it 4 times."
5,avatar,"Based on the discussions regarding the creation of this movie, I felt worth buying it. Boy, was I surprised at how well this actually presented a story. While not a complex story, and the characters are clearly stereotyped (bad guys wear black hats, good guys wear white hats) I found this unjoyable to watch. Not only that, I plan to do so again shortly.Another factor, that while there is bloodleting here, generally I found this acceptable to allow my grandchildren to see as well."
2,"Uh.....como se dice ""LAME""?","My elderly father really wanted me to watch this with him. So I did. The CGI/animation is mostly good although there are parts where it is a little cheesy. I don't necessarily disagree with the message - just that it was too silly a movie to take seriously. But, my dad is 85 and if it makes him happy...well, that's the second star."
1,Defective Disk,"Defective disk. Froze and stopped playing about 10 minutes in. Then was able to play if I skipped past the bad spot, so about 15 minutes is unviewable. Also had trouble with my BluRay player playing it at all. It took like 8 tries to start and I have a fully updated firmware Samsung player. I also read reviews how this release has so much copyright DRM protection that many players won't play it at all."
2,"Good movie, not happy with the product though","Happy with the movies, that is one of my favourite.I bought this item as ""used - good"". It did NOT came with the blu ray jewel case but in DVD case, does not fit to my blu ray collection."
4,big budget remake of FERN GULLY cartoon,"Great visuals and music highlight this remake of the FERN GULLY cartoon set on another planet. Cameron's film does not include the song LAND OF 1000 DANCES featured in the original, however (probably a royalties thing)."
3,"Great special effects, but...","I really thought I would like this movie. All the reviews said it was great and it made so much money that I thought it would be one of the best movies of all time. I rented this and was blown away by how visually stunning it was. I mean the special effects in it were terrific. However beyond that, there isn't much else to reccomend.The story is cliched and it gets so preachy about how humans are destroying their planet in the pursuit of technology (ironically without this technology, the movie wouldn't have been able to be made). Plus there are two major plot holes. One being why the lead is sent out into the field without much training, especially considering the cost of the avatar. The other being why the Pandorans teach him their ways and secrets when they know the avatar is nothing but a shell and he's really not one of them.Overall an overrated movie."
1,Rip off.,"This is supposed to be a 2 disc set. One DVD and one Blu-Ray. My package contained only the DVD with an empty space where the Blu-Ray disc was supposed to be. The security seal on the package was still intact and the case itself says ""2 disc set Blu-ray/DVD Combo""I cannot suggest anyone buy this item since it is not being delivered as advertised."
1,Terrible terrible movie,"I have no idea why people like this movie. The story is unoriginal--to put it mildly. The premise is absurd. The acting is stiff as cardboard. It stars Sam Worthington. Wow, it is sooo bad. The fact that it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars is all you need to know about that institution."
1,"Amazing effect, weak story.","The effects are mind blowing.The story is startling similar to Dances with Wolves. ""White Man is needed to save the savages from the tyranny of other White Man"". Really? Seems pretty un PC to me.Somehow James Cameron is given a pass because his politics are ""correct"" in Hollywood.Worth seeing once (rent it). Buyng it will only encourage Cameron to keep making more (he's threatened what, 3 more Avatar movies so far?)."
2,They call this entertainment,"I am sure am glad I did not rent,buy or purchase a ticket to see this movie that everybody was so amazed by with it 3D special effects and had it not been for a freebie view from HBO I would not have cared so I decided to record it for later view After about 15 minutes of this I decided I had better thing to watch and do than spend another 2 hrs plus watching a bunch junk. There was no need to have people speak in another alien voice and use sub titles that went out in the 1940 and this was supposed to be a high tech hit I beg to differ. Acting such as it was was poor and plot was jumpy and hard to follow. 2 star is all it getting and no more so save your money and download here or wait and you will find it at a yard sale sooner or later."
5,It was delivery fast and just as described.,"The item arrived very fast and even though I thought the shipping and handling fee was a too high, I bought it because I love this movie. It was a pleasure making business with you, thanks."
5,BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!,"For a person who did not see it in 3D I was still amazed with the movie, sound, picture and everything else! I will for warn you that you will not get extras. But they plan to re-release this in November in a 3D version and it will have extras. So just pick up the movie it is like eye candy."
2,its a toon,"I cant understand why Avatar is put in the science fiction section on Amazon, or that it even was in the best picture category at the Oscars. It is 90% ANIMATED. It should have been in the ""Best Animated Feature"" Category.The story is mostly a blend of; ""Medicine Man"" meets ""Pocahontas"", meets ""100 Million B.C."".The animation, (CGI) breakthroughs bring hope for future films like this in the future."
2,What was all the hype about?,"James Cameron should be ashamed of AVATAR. With a half-billion dollar budget and more hype than a Beatles reunion, this film should have been extraordinary. And I'll grant you this, that AVATAR is an extraordinary visual experience. Cameron has crafted an entire painstakingly detailed world onscreen, and as long as we stay immersed in that world AVATAR delivers all that it promises.But like so many sci-fi creators, Cameron committed the Cardinal Sin: He spent a half-billion dollars on effects and a buck three eighty on the storyline, which is nothing more than an unsatisfying high tech extraterrestrial version of cowboys and indians.Considering that he probably could have cured cancer for what this picture cost to make, Cameron should spend the next ten years in retreat, doing just that.The Hurt Lockerwasn't much as a Best Picture winner that year but it sent the message loud and clear that obscenely budgeted movies still need to have more than flash in order to succeed."
1,Why is this movie listed under 3D Blu-Ray When it's not in 3D,"You do a search for 3D Blu-Ray and this movie comes up, why? It's pissing me off that this movie has been out almost a year now and still no 3D version's come out yet."
3,Lo-tech for me,"I bought the DVD the day it came out (Earth Day) and decided not to watch it, so I returned it for a full refund. The next day Avatar was already in one of those Safeway rental machines for a buck. Yeah, it was worth a buck. However, because I'm lo-tech with a small 2D screen, I need to rely on storyline. Obviously, the visuals looked fake. It was hard to watch the first few chapters, but things picked up pretty well. Character development was good, not great, and the plot was OK (predictable). I would have been enthralled if this movie had underlying messages about the environment. But I guess the focus was on effects."
1,Is it made of gold?,"I like this movie, don't get me wrong, and I'm really looking forward to seeing it in 3D. But seriously...$179...ARE YOU CRAZY!!!!!!"
2,Cow Boys and Indians?,"I finally had the chance to view Avatar and have to say that the special effects are definitely amazing. That said, the story is a repeat of the ever successful cow boys vs. indians we are all acquainted with... With much less ""in your face"" special effects, I put the ""district 9"" story line 10 times better than Avatar.... worth renting, not buying in my opinion."
1,Don't Fall For The Fake Release,"Be warned that this is just the movie, the real release won't be until next November, and even longer until a 3-D release (not that 3-D will matter to many in the near future)Fox to mine ""Avatar"" DVD release three times: Disc released in April will have no special features [...]"
5,Blue Ray the only way,"I did not see the movie in the theaters.For two reason, one I seldom make it through a move with needing a rest room break Old Age. I enjoy the movies more at home. I watch the movie in Blue Ray then none HD. There is a world of difference in the picture quality.The none HD the colors are flat, simply put it is not the same movie. This movie realy show what HD can and should do. So many movies say they are HD but really are not. My over all view of the move is very good. There are a few times when what they did breaks the laws of physic but this a movie and they do it all the time. It is a movie that I amm happy that I have added to my collectin."
3,A Dirty Hippie Movie...,"...that uses technology to lecture us all on the evils of technology.How did James Cameron go from Terminator to THIS, right? ""Titanic"" was the turning point here.I saw this film in 3D, and although I was blown away by the F/X, the plot was a ripoff of any number of living with the local stories, albeit one told on an alien planet where everything is capable of communicating with each other--which is just creepy as hell.Hero Jake because an alien after being blue for about six monhs--""This is our land!"" Really?Spoiler alert: the aliens defeat the humans and their 23rd technology with sticks and stones and wilderbeest."
2,Not enough oos effects!,"My rating is based on the 3D content and I was expecting a lot of oos (out of screen)effects and was very very disappointed ! They had maybe 5-6 that came out maybe 10 % they way out. Come on 3D movie makers,the best thing about 3D in my opinion are when things come far out the screen!!!"
4,"Avatar - Good Film, Not Great",I just got done watching Avatar for the first time. After all the hype it had a lot to live up to. The first hour was not so good. Things are rushed there are alot of character you don't care about. A lot of Hollywood Movie cliches in the first hour. After that the movie picks up but the ending clearly shows that James Cameron backed himself in corner and took the easy way out. Or didn't want to spend another 15 - 30 minutes having Navi making a better battle plan. The Marines where one big cliche. I prefer the Marines in Aliens than Avatar. Overall a fun flick and if its on when I turn the channel I may leave it on. But it definately didn't live up to the hype. Now I will head over to Red Letter Media and see how they reviewed it. That should be fun.
5,great,"Just wanted to give my 3dtv a boost with a decent collection and this movie is excellent. Story line is kinda basic at best but the visuals are totally awesome. I have the vizio 32"" 3d tv and the visuals don't really fly off the screen, but gives you a depth and floats a little off the screen but not like some LG ones I have seen that fly at you"
5,Good Stuff!!!,"Avatar is a GREAT film! It is a visual masterpiece and the special effects are stunning beyond belief. I think the movie's message is that we could all stand to learn something from a peaceful, nature-loving alien population. There are strong environmental and pro-peace themes. I definitely recommend this movie!!"
3,Ok but not great,"Watched the movie, but not in the theaters so I won't comment on the 3-d aspect, but I failed to see what the hype was all about. I'll admit the CGI was impressive, but the story line was the same old boy works for evil guy, boy falls for pretty girl, boy reveals he is working for evil guy and is shunned, boy makes heroic stand on behalf of his new people, big battle that's almost lost, happily ever after model. I knew exactly what was going to happen before the movie ended. The dialoge was uninspiring, but tolerable. Maybe I would rate it higher if I had shelled out the extra money to see it in 3-d."
2,No subtitles for hearing-impaired,"The second issue of Avatar, the one with all the great extra goodies that Avatar fans did not get when they bought the first issue. And no subtitles on the special features?Why do so many vendors ignore the needs of the hearing-impaired? Shame on James Cameron and on Twentieth-Century Fox. This thing is going back."
5,Excellent Movie,"Excellent movie, great quality with blue ray. It is great that amazon offers it at such an affordable price"
5,Cannot imagine how Graphics makes wonders,"After watching the Avatar - Extended Collector's Edition, I really wonders will Graphics can entertain like this.Immediatly after watching this movie, my son who is of 13 years old asked me that he wants to learn Graphics.In Disc 2, it explains well how Graphics supported the parts of the movie shooted.Overall I am very much happy about my purchase, I am recommending this package to everyone who loves to watch movies."
2,"""Dances w/Navi""","Using Pohl Anderson's [at least *he's* dead!] ""Call Me Joe"" & an almost shot-for-shot [in key sequences] copy of -Dances w/Wolves-, -Avatar- isn't Cameron's film. It's a 3D rip-off of a better tale & an Oscar-winning movie. Ja, it's pretty, but then so's my sister. & *she* wouldn't charge you to look at her! But for those of you Cameron-files out there who've missed out, it's a bonny tale of Noble Savages v. Eevil Capitalists, where the Noble Savages win, & then maybe live Happily Ever After in theit Happy Hunting Grounds..."
1,Skipping on both of Avatar 3-disc sets,"After returning the first 3-disc set of the movie Avatar because the first disc skipped, I was shipped another set. I took this set to my grandchildren, for whom I had gotten it as a Christmas gift. We watched the first disc - no problems. About halfway through the second disc, the movie started ""breaking up"". When we took out the disc and examined it, it had marks on it (like they were right under the outer surface of the disc). We looked at the third disc and found the same marks. I am very disappointed in this purchase. I have never had any complaints with anything I have purchased using Amazon, but this was a bust. (The other DVD I had ordered at the same time had no problems.) I am returning this to Amazon as soon as possible."
2,ALIEN POCAHONTAS,"SOUND AND SFX VERY GOOD,,,,,STORY LINE THE SAME AS POCAHONTAS BUT IN ANOTHER GALAXY, TIME AND PLANET.....The Cool thing about this film is that all of the tribe Na'vi are fully compatible high as they can be plugged in any animal on the planet."
4,"Amazing 3D, OK story.","The story has been told over and over from as early as the twilight zone (prob earlier) ""Man is the real threat!"" without giving anything away we go with Jake Sully through his journey on finding this out.The real reason that Avatar is/was such a hit is because of the genius 3D. breathtaking & it shows off every aspect of what makes 3D a site to be seen."
2,Still waiting.,"I bought the original theatrical release blu-ray, then the 5 disc extended set..I don't care about the extras because I already have them on the set, but now, after buying a new 3DTV and Blu-Ray player just for this, it's not the extended version?Sorry Fox.. Perhaps in a few more years, when you release the good version.Also about comments regarding things ""coming out of the screen"" That's not supposed to happen with this film.. It's designed to appear as if you're looking though a window at the world in the movie, not having it come into your room.. Stuff jumping out of the screen at you is a sign of bad 3D.."
5,Avitar in 3D,"The product arived in good condition and on time. Although more expensive, it is worth it; this is the way ""Avitar"" should be seen."
4,Visual fantasy,"I waited a long time for Avatar to come out on DVD and after seeing it (in 2-D) I'm thinking it might just be one of the few movies I'd go to see in a theater; the big screen 3-D experience would be something to behold!This movie is very impressive, visually. There is more ""language"" than I care for so I don't reccommend it for kids. But, if you're into state of the art graphics, this is one to see."
4,Wow,"Everything you've heard about this movie is true. It is beautiful. The setting is dripping with colors and amazing effects. Not only that, but the integration between the live action and the CGI is really something to see. It is long. And I mean this in a good way. With so many movies clocking in at 90 minutes, its nice to really get some serious bang for your movie(or DVD) buck. Nearly three hours of top-drawer story telling. It is a bit preachy. Evil technology is out to destroy the natural balance. I'm no tree hugger, by any stretch of the imagination. That said, you'll be cheering for the indigenous Na'vi, much in the same way that we rooted for the Ewoks back in the day. This battle is certainly on a much grander scheme.Adventure, romance, and humor. The cast is diverse with heroes and villains each playing their part to move the story along. The movie looks great and sounds amazing. In case there was any doubt whatsoever, James Cameron has another hit on his hands."
1,Downside vs Upside....,"Downside:No digital copy !? Really -- wow, cheap...And no discount coupon or rebate offered for people who ponied up the $30 for the first Blu-ray release.Upside:16 minutes of footage.....My vote on this one ---- Pass, rent it maybe for the 16 minutes of footage, but its not worth buying."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR $,"I will start by explaining I DO NOT OWN THIS VERISION OF THE FILM. I bought the standard copy (without any special extra's). I thought about waiting for this release to buy the movie but I was excited to watch the movie at home. Avatar was an awesome concept but the ""cool factor"" of the movie is cut by well over half without 3-D. The plot is preachy and uninspired (watch FurnGully for further proof). Who ever thought 54$ for a blu-ray that is'nt a couple of film's was a good idea is clearly just trying to milk us for every cent they possibly can. Do yourself a favor if you like this movie buy the theatrical edition and dont give in and pay for this verision, it only promotes their greedy reasoning."
1,No 3D version,"This is a great movie that is visually stunning and captivating. I bought the original release so that I could enjoy watching the movie in 2D while I waited for the 3D version to be released. Now they are releasing a Collector's Edition of the movie which is fantastic but they should have included these movies in 3D as released in the theaters. For that exclusion, this release gets one star"
2,Family Audio has swear word in it!,"I love the movie when I watched it on the theater so when I got the collectors addition that allows me to use the family audio i was exited to watch it with my children. Well, when the main char. Jake finds the native girl & right where they start arguing & she slaps him to ground he gets back up & uses the word ""ass"" i have NO idea why in the word they did not cut that out. I did not have time to call Amazon yet to ask if I got bad batch? But be warned if you got kids they will hear that word. Shame.... :("
1,Don't Buy This Garbage!,"Another Way for James Cameron to fill his fat pockets. You think James Cameron made this movie to make a statement about how people are destroying the Earth...WRONG! Let's see how many Avatar Burger King Toys and action figures are filling up landfills 1000 years from now. It's losers like this that make a crappy retold story and package/market it like nothing we've ever seen before and then make it seem like he did it to help humanity. Don't fall for this. Buy a Classic Sci-Fi Movie like Blade Runner...something with a truly original story and Idea. james Cameron Wishes he was Ridley Scott, but he doesn't even come close."
3,Where did i see this before,"A very stunningly gorgeous film. I only wish i could live the life on such a planet. Oh yeah, Earth was gorgous at one time, huh?Well, the Na'vi have us to thank for screwing up their planet too.There is a nagging thought though....I have seen this movie more then once. Campare it to the Stunningly gorgeously viewable film, The Last Samurai, which in its turn was compared to the gorgeous film of Dances with Wolves. I expected more from James Cameron. At least he didn't copy The Fast and the Furious"
5,WOW!,"Best movie I've seen, ever! Combines Sci-fi, fantasy, war, dragons, little blue men that are 10 feet tall and a living planet that wakes up! A love story too. Don't wait for the DVD, see it on the BIG SCREEN in 3D. (But use the bathroom before the movie starts- it's 2 and 1/2 hours long.) The computer generated graphics are so real, you can't tell where they end and reality begins. . . ."
3,Avatar CUT,"I love the movie, I'd give the full version four and a half stars. But this isn't the movie I saw at the megaplex. This isn't close. I don't mind that it isn't 3D. I do mind that they shaved off some bits that modified the story line slightly. Unless I slept through it they took out the nookie, now I didn't need to see blue folks getting it on, but the mating made them a pair and that was supposed to be for her and the guy who would become king. So when she chose the tiny alien she really messed up the tribal politics... and that was cut.I'm not going to be suckered in to buying every version of this. So instead I'll mark this down to experience and put it on my list of movies to buy when 3D is sorted out on TVs and they my flat screen is worth replacing.I doubt anyone will ever read this warning, but I should still try."
3,Like every other James Cameron movie,"To begin with this movie features bits and pieces of Cameron's other movies. Lets start with Aliens, well in Avatar they are trying to farm for natural resources , not much different in Aliens. Also featured from Aliens is the radar scanners and Sigourney Weaver. Next Cameron movie Terminator, Avatar features ships robots just like in Terminator. Finally, Titanic is also featured in Avatar though not a big part, a ship does go down. Having seen the movie all the way through 5 times and just the ending 15 plus times, I still think this movie is not all that it's cracked up to be. You may ask why have I seen the movie 5 times, well I work at a movie theater that requires us to collect glasses at the end of the movie, but have to sit in theater and watch the movie with the paying customers. That being said other 3-D movies such as Up I watched over fifteen times and never got tired of it."
4,"Great Movie, excellent 3D, but NO extras","A spectacular and moving film with unrivaled visual quality, especially in 3D. There is so much in the film I suppose there was no more space for additional ""making of"" etc. or directors comments or anything else. There's just the movie, period. I think they cut parts out of the DVD as compared with the theater version as snippets I recall were missing or in one case added. Does this hurt the film? No. It is just so spectacular we really looked for explanations of how they did it all. If you're curious for more, as we were, get another version."
5,"Is Avatar ""EXTENDED EDITION"" available in ""3D""?","Is Avatar ""EXTENDED EDITION"" available in ""3D""?If not - does anyone know if this will be an option in future and when it may be available?"
5,3D VERSION OF THE AVATAR BLOCKBUSTER,THIS FILM ORIGINALLY AVAILABLE TO MOST IN 2D IS EVEN MORE EXCITING IN 3DBEAUTIDUL PHOTOGRAPHY AND ENJOYABLE SCIFI TYPE STORY
5,WOW is it Cool!,"We love this movie, the case looks like a book and WOW is it cool. I love having the option to watch it in three differnt versions. I would recommend this to any one!"
5,Outstanding 3D Movie,"This movie is the best 3D movie I have ever seen. I went to see it 2 times in 2 days. I thought I could improve my viewing the second time around by sitting in different seats than the first time. You might try sitting eye level and closer to the screen so it sort of envelopes you. The first time was awesome, the second time was outstanding. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Great Movie! Amazing 3D!!,"Actually purchased the 3D version even though I already owned the regular blu-ray. We don't watch many 3D movies, however, Avatar has definitely been the best 3D wise and worth the upgrade if you have the 3D capability. We watched it on an LG set with passive glasses and all liked it."
4,As good as expected,"Very satisfied after mistakenly buying the overpriced ""Change disc in the middle"" Directors Edition. Shipped promptly, in great condition. As good as I remembered from the theatrical release."
5,Need I Say More??,"This movie is THE BEST movie I have seen in a long time! The visuals are stunning, the music is perfect, and the intensity is very forgiving and makes you want more! I could not wait (and why should anyone who has seen this movie in the theaters) to buy this movie in 3D or the extended edition. Also, I highly suggest watching this movie on an LED HD TV...so real you think you are looking out a window!!"
4,"No frills, no extras...just the right content.","If you enjoy the classic version of the film and don't have time to muck around with all the extras, features, commentary, blah blah blah...Then this is the right DVD for you. It is good value for a Blu-ray edition.Yes yes, we all know there will be an enhanced verion with extra content, 3D (for those of you with 4 pairs of expensive glasses and TVs) and features just in time for the holiday rush. There always is a premium cost involved, so expect a two and or three disc version later at 25-30% premium.For those of you who *just* want to enjoy the movie the way you paid for it on the big screen, then enjoy the Blu-ray for yourself and lend out disc two, the DVD standard resolution to a friend.A good movie all-in-all...I agree, not an Oscar award-winner, but worth the watch for you fantasy and sci-fi folks."
5,Best Movie,I have a large number of movies and consider myself as well versed on all styles of movies. Avatar is the BEST movie I have ever seen. I went to see it at the theater 3 times and that is something I have never done before. I just couldn't get enough of it. The story is wonderful and the graphics are amazing! I've already signed up to be alerted as soon as it comes out on DVD.
3,Tecnological marvel. Average movie,"The vision of the director and the visual effects are stunning. The motion capture cameras are a true technological marvel. No amount of animation or prosthetics could have made this possible. The imagination and creativity which went into creating pandorum and its inhabitants is mind boggling.Alas great visual effects does not a movie make. With a wafer thin story line, you always put the movie in peril when you drag it out past the 2 hour mark. Also it seemed like the movie had an identity crisis - it seemed to shuttle between between the action genre as well as drama. But in the end fulfilling neither to satisfaction.In summary, watch it for the visual effects. Don't expect anything more."
4,Amazing Quality,"I'm one of those weirdos that didn't fall in love with Avatar. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, just not in my personal top 10. However, this movie in BluRay... WOW! The graphics are top notch in deed!"
3,Avatar,"Stunning graphics. The story works well as science fiction at first. Then if fades into 'Dances With Wolves' in the future. The 'Noble Savage' stuff doesn't work for me. Yes, the exploiters were bad."
1,Rip-Off,"Exclusive Panasonic... BS. I am not about to purchase a Panasonic 3d TV just to get this, especially since I already have a 3D set-up including a 3D TV and a 3D Blu-Ray DVD player and the glasses you are delusional!"
1,DON'T BE RIPPED OFF!!!,"Avatar has been re-released on 3D Blu-Ray and is available for $29.99 at Local retail stores...DO NOT be fooled into the ""this is so rare!"" or ""Panasonic RARE!"" gimmick. I bought mine at Walmart 5/25/2012 and there where still 2 others on the shelf. And yes It is 3D Blu-Ray and not DVD or The old school 3D with the Red/Blue glasses."
1,Not worth the money!,"This movie is a perfect example of over pricing in 3d! I can't wait until Feb 2012 when the movie can be released away from panasonic products at its deserved 20-30 dollar price. I have seen this movie twice in 3d, once on the imax. I would never pay over 100 dollars to see it again at home. I will wait till this movie is re-released before I spend a bunch of money on this pocahontas meets ferngully flick. I purchased 2 pair of shutter glasses and monsters vs aliens for just 30 dollars more than this one movie. Why anyone would buy this movie now is beyond me! My advice buy the 5-6 other 3d bluray movies you want and wait on this one!"
5,One of the greatest movies ever made!,"I have been a movie buff for all my life and in my opinion Avatar has to be one of the greatest movies ever made, especially in 3-D. I went to see it three times when it was in the theater. The story line is predictable but the special affects are Fantastic!! The bond that the people have with the planet is kind of mystical, I felt like a kid discovering a special place. I wanted to be on one of those birds soaring high in the sky. I was very disappointed when it didn't get picture of the year at the Acadamy Awards. I couldn't wait for it to come out in DVD and was diappointed that it didn't come out in 3-D but I bought it anyway and was pleasantly surprised, the 3-D version is on my Christmas wish list. It's definitely a must buy for your DVD collection!"
3,Great Special Effects 3 1/2 stars,"There is no doubt that all the special effects in this film were ground breaking. However, I had heard that this was the best thing since Star Wars which it is absolutely not. The story line wasn't original enough to be given that title. Very predictable. I enjoyed it, but I was not included in the group of people angered that it did not win the Best Picture Oscar. It did not deserve it. Worth a watch, but, in my opinion, a little overrated."
3,Finally a Blu-Ray !!,"That I am not forced to pay $30 for!! Sure If I want the special addition I will wait just like for the LOTR trilogy. But truthfully this movie is not worth that wait. It was great in IMAX 3D but most of that specticle is gone here in the home. Not all but most , this is not a movie with a great story. Entertaining yes for sure and I do think its worth a watch from everyone."
2,Wouldnt Load and Start,"1st two discs wouldnt load in a blu ray player, only the last one did. I heard im not the only one"
1,"Awesome movie, but why waste money on this version?","Love this movie, but this release is a blatant money-grab by the studio. Don't get ripped off - wait for the real version with extra footage coming later this year!"
1,Double-Dip Shenanigans!,"This type of release is disrespectful, and spits in the the face of the consumer.-No special Features-No 3D presentaionIt's a planned double-dip, so I will wait it out and buy the better version of the disc being released in the fall."
2,Dances with Wolves?,"The argument is very similar to Dances with wolves... but in HD, Hi-tech, sci-fi version. I prefer Dances with Wolves."
1,Way Too Liberal For Me,"This showed sucks, being ultra-right this movie made me want to throw up. Looked good on my big TV, sound was great but thats about it. The plot was a bunch of BS. It would have been ok if the Marines killed everyone when they shot the tree down and they should have shot Sigourney Weaver and the Marine who couldnt walk as soon as he found out they were both traders. I'm soo glad i didnt buy this movie."
1,Smurf trek,"James Cameron spent 12 YEARS thinking about this .12 YEARS!Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in less time.Leonardo did the Mona Lisa in less time.The Golden Gate Bridge took less time.Building the Haldon Collider took less time.WW2 took less time.etc.12 years ,an enormous amount of hype to justify exorbitant ticket prices,and all we have to show is a remake of ""Dances with the Wolves"" done with smurfs!Honestly, this is no better than a very poor episode of Star Trek(the TV version)."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I bought this DVD all excited to watch this phenominal movie at home. What a disappointment. The sound quality is slightly muffled and the picture quality is horrible. The colors are dull and ""smudgy."" I have to tell my 5 year old son what they're saying and doing, because its so hard to see and hear. I contacted Amazon to return it, but they said I have to pay a 20% restocking fee since I opened it.Terrible.AND...don't expect anything but the movie. No special features....nothing. Just the movie.Save your money until whatever next edition they're putting out. It seems like they threw this thing together to make another billion. No Quality."
1,Don't Buy,Over a week after I got this BD disk I still cannot play it in my Sharp player. Also there are scenes that were in the theater release that are not on the disk (I watched the DVD). This is the last BD disk I will ever buy!
1,Horrible release of an excellent movie.,"What an incredible letdown. Bare bones release with NO special features whatsoever. There is not even a single ""preview of coming attractions""! I feel as if the studio has robbed me, during a time when we have limited our spending on non-necessities. This was a movie the whole family decided on owning, and so we bought it the very first day it released. I hope that you are reading all these reviews before you give your hard earned money to these folks. Rent it, and wait for the ""real"" release. This really is an excellent movie, but don't spend your hard earned money to buy this version. Shame on you 20th Century Fox!"
2,3D theatrical version,"The ""general-public"" 3D version which we waited so long on is a theatrical version which was already released years ago for the Panasonic 3D TVs. This is nothing new.Better wait for the 3D extended version.The movie is a interesting but a little dry. The bad part will be that in another year when the extended 3D version will be available, there will be plenty of better 3D choices of movies around."
1,Blu-ray disc does not play,"I know that others have had problems with the Blu Ray playback. I have a Sharp BD HP22U with the latest firmware update. The disc plays about half of the movie then locks up. On a positive note, Fox did include the plain DVD version which does play. Obviously they knew that their developers had created a POS program that would not work on many players. I feel really bad for the folks who have players with firmware that can not be updated.Great movie - horrible execution by Fox."
1,GREAT Movie! Disgusting Marketing Trick!,"That sucking sound you hear is Fox with their fangs in your wallet. Why do they keep doing this to us? Do they think we are stupid? I suppose some people will pay just about anything so they can be the first on their block to own this movie, and that's what Fox is counting on. RESIST! Wait until the full-featured version comes out in a few months. Send a unified message to the Hollywood studios (and Fox in particular) that we're not going to be suckered into buying twice by this sleazy marketing tactic!"
1,Burned!!!,"I assumed this 2 disc set would have special features before I did my homework but later came to find that all you get is the movie and another release this fall will have special features and extended scenes. In additon, inside the packaging they actually provide a coupon to go on-line and download more coupons to save a few bucks on the fall release? So absolutely tired of the marketing gimicks used to milk every penny from consumers!"
3,Good !,I preordered this because i knew it will be awesome. And it was. The execution is fantastic but the story is so last year that it hurts my brain. You could simply put the characters into 21st century and give them some weapons and fast and furious cars and there you have it. The tree could be some building and sleeping cocoons could be some drug or similar.Well i simplified it a lot but you get the picture (pun intended). I have to admit i saw it only once. I would really like to watch it again but i cannot make myself doing it.
5,good purchase,"saw it in the theater and fell in love with it. Story's sad, but the CGI is incredible and as a Blu-Ray, it rocks."
5,Avtar,This is one of my favorite movies ! the story the colors the animals the floating mountains and love for their planet . The imagination for all of it !!!!! Cant wait for the next one
5,absolutley stunning.,"this 3 disc version of this movie is awesome, theres aternate endings, tons of extended footage, enough to keep you very busy for a long time. if youve never seen Avatar, hurry up and buy."
1,"Puts the 'Limited' in ""Limited Edition""","I am a fan of this movie, and picked up the 2D version twice, once when it came out, and got suckered in by not noticing it had zero special features. Brought the second release with all the cool extras. Now picked up the 3D limited edition naively, and just noticed that it comes with ZERO special features lol.Buy Prometheus. That comes with all three discs, AND hours upon hours of cool special features.This is a bare bones uber rip off."
1,won't play on almost any blu Ray,"I have a media center with bluRay, two Laptops with bluray's readers (one of which is like 5 months old) and NONE of my bluray can play this movie. It's Outrageous that makers spend so much time trying to stop piracy with new DRM and by doing that, encouraging to buy pirated versions. Is amazing that those who Do buy the products are the one who pay the price.I updated ALL firmwares and nothing... can you believe that? I mean, Why don't they advertise ""AVATAR WON""T PLAY ON...""? And as I read around blogs over the internet, is not one player... there are a LOT of players that can't play a ""split between DISCS"" movie. I can also say that I have about 30 blu-ray discs and NONE of them had this problem ever. At least, if they had it, updates where painless."
1,"bad script means on ur tv, this thing will die faster and harder",Avoid seeing this Cameron ego trip on the small screen because its confused and overall horrid script and muddy characterizations will not have a massive screen to carry things along. This is a typical example of Hollywood's all flash and no substance. Take away the flash by reducing your screen size and the hollow shell will certainly disappoint you. Skip the home versions.
5,Avatar 3D Blu-Ray Is A Panasonic Exclusive Until The End Of Feb 2012,Avatar 3D Blu-Ray Is A Panasonic Exclusive Until The End Of Feb 2012. After that the price will drop to that of a regular 3D Blu-ray release and it will be freely available to all (without buying a Panasonic 3D kit with second gen glasses and a bunch of junk) via Amazon and the like.Not long now.
5,First blu-ray movie,First blu-ray movie we've seen. The details are spectacular. Like being in another world. Really enjoyed it.
4,great blu ray,the only bad thing of this blu ray its that it dosent come on 3d but still its a great movie
2,Disappointed,"I have to say I was highly disappointed in this movie. I guess the only thing going for it was the 3-D in the theater. If any of you have ever seen the cartoon movie ""Ferngully"" this movie is a rip-off of the entire storyline! The giant tree of life, the giant bulldozer scene, the guy being changed into another creature, the moral of protecting all of nature because it all has a purpose - REALLY? There was nothing original in this movie except the people being blue. I was expecting so much more."
2,Not that great of movie,"Maybe I got all tied up in the hype. After waiting for a year so I could see it for the first time in 3D, I wasn't impressed."
1,Avatar 3D,This is the second time I have been asked to give a preview on one of the Movies that I have ordered through amazon but imam unable to do the preview as I have not yet recieved the Movie .Thanks Robert
2,Not as advertised,"First off, reviews should be for the item NOT the seller. That's what the resolution center is for.Second: yes, there are 3 movies here, but half is on ONE disk and half is on the 2nd disk! NOT ONE MOVIE PER DISK! That is why I got it. To give a copy to family members w/children. VERY disappointed."
1,No special features,The reason why i buy blu-rays are because the special features. I pre-order avatar blu-ray so there were no any reviews yet...but i guess all people wanted blu ray for the special features. Other thing than that no doubt the movie was brilliant. I guess it's not smart to pre-order blu rays before you know the details/reviews.
5,Fantastic!,"This is a movie my husband and I both adore! So much truth in it, even though it's kind of sci-fi. It was a must have in our video library!"
5,Better than the theatre version!,"The added scenes help set the stage, right from the beginning. The quality of the transfer is excellent, in terms of both video and audio. It's a wonderful accomplishment and I can't wait to see what Cameron and Company do for the sequel(s). The above notwithstanding, I am nostalgic for the first time I saw the film in an IMAX 3D cinema. It was truly magical and if it plays the IMAX circuit again, I'll be there."
5,AVATAR,ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE IS GREAT.
4,Spoiler,"It's hard to believe that such a CGI masterpiece would have such a poorly designed entrance. The ""PLAY-SCENES"" icons are nearly impossible to interpret from a normal distance. When you select PLAY the small text inside the icon changes from medium blue to light blue. You have to take off the 3D glasses and move close to the screen to see the change; confirmation that the selection was made. I almost returned the DVD before I discovered the change. (5 stars for the movie, less 1 star for the entrance.)"
1,A boring movie that bring nothing except special effect,The movie itself is a 2/5 but with the huge amount of times it is being released I had to bump my review down a point. The movie was boring and brought nothing that has not been seen in dozens of other films. What did this movie have 3D and special effect. I could not care any less for 3D so that ruins and hope I had for this movie when it was over.
3,Amazing visuals & not much else.,"I didn't go in to this movie with expectations of greatness in any area other than special effects. But even with lowered expectations, I thought this movie was filled with one eye rolling moment after another. Amazing visuals & looks great on Blu-ray, but this is something I feel absolutely no urge to watch again anytime soon do to the overly cliched & over the top characters, not to mention having about 45 minutes of boredom that could've easily ended up on the cutting room floor. Not a very good movie, but a great spectacle."
4,Avatar Extended Collection Blu-Ray,Already a great movie made longer; the extended scenes helps the story unfold more. If you havent pick up this movie already the extended version was worth the wait.
5,Avatar Bluy Ray,"Me and my husband saw this movie in theaters and it was great!! He couldn't wait until it came out for sale. So I ordered it for his christmas this year. Blu rays are always the best way to go, especially with this movie!! So although I haven't opened and tried it out, I know that I will be fully satisfied with it and everything included. Definitely a must buy for this holiday season!!!"
5,Awesome,"I'm soooooooo glad I read a James Cameron interview on EW, talking about how in Nov he'd release the Complete 3 BluRay Disc.With tons of extras! B/C of that article my waiting paid off. Didn't have to buy the same movie twice!"
2,"Incredible visuals, but not much else","Put succinctly, and echoing what others have already addressed, Avatar on Blu-Ray is an incredibly visually stimulating experience. Alas, I was underwhelmed by this frugal iteration as it ""special-features challenged"". That is, the ONLY ""extras"" one is given here is ability to choose subtitles and a choice of language...THAT'S IT!If what others have revealed is factual (that there will be a future edition with extras), then I strongly encourage everyone to patiently await its arrival. Frankly, I am disappointed and would like my money back."
5,Reference Level 3D Blu-ray Experience,"I was blown away by the transfer of this movie to 3D Blu-ray. I watched it on a Samsung ES8000 3D LED TV and could not have been more impressed. The story is OK, but the 3D visuals are reference quality. Great sense of depth and a feeling of immersion into the film.When you want to show off what 3D TV can do - use this disc."
5,AWESOME 3D!!,Fabulous movie in 3D. A must have for any 3D collection. Amazing special effects and cinematography. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Save your money,"Great movie but the 3-D effect was, at best, marginal. Couldn't tell much difference with the glasses on or off."
3,Great movie/Disappointing DVD,"I purchased this DVD because I really liked the movie. However, beyond simply liking the movie, I usually buy a DVD for what we don't see in the movie, such as the making of the movie, star and director commentary, deleted scenes etc. This DVD came with no extra features, and this was very disappointing to me. I'm guessing that the DVD will be re-released soon as a special edition and it will contain all of the features I thought I was getting this time around."
3,Avatar DVD with different endings,"I was disappointed that no instructions were provided with this product to enable subtitles. I purchased this product as a Christmas present for a relative in Romania who is not familiar with the English language. While the movie is very well done, the lack of subtitles in Romania language (or even in the French language) was substantially less than satisfactory"
2,HERE WE GO AGAIN!,"OK, I did buy the first theatrical version that was put out....THEN he releases the extended edition, which I happily bought because it was a better version...but now were gonna try and sneak in a 3D version of the theatrical edition? Most fans already have the extended verision after buying the original, why on earth would you go back to the shorter version just because it's 3D? SHAME ON YOU JAMES CAMERON! Sounds like a Star Wars product release, as if no one learned from that mess...(which is not done yet...3D)! I will gladly wait for the extended edition 3D bluray! PLEASE do NOT encourage this behavior!!! It is a wallet raping!"
3,"Avatar 3D, Why No Extended Version in 3D Yet?","Only 3 Stars.....because no new extras and not Extended version.I have had the 3D version for 6 months now, compliments of Panasonic. I love it! The depth of the 3D rivals cartoon 3D (UP, How to Train Your Dragon, etc.) I just wonder why the Extended version wasn't released....Perhaps it will go the route of the Star Wars movies, ie: A new, 'IMPROVED with more features' version every 6 months! The almighty dollar is the force behind that, I imagine.Welp, This version of AVATAR will not be purchased by me...why duplicate what I already have?20th Century..listen well to me...you want to sell the 3D version and make money? Release the extended version in 3D....Then I will buy it, as, I am sure, many other 3D TV owners."
2,Good not great,"I bought this the first day out because I missed this in the movies. Couldnt wait to see it finally!! Fantastic visuals on blu ray. You can tell alot of time (and money) was spent ensuring the graphics were top notch but definitly less time and effort put into the speaking parts, especially on the human side. Acting in my opion was average to poor. The script was just poorly written. The use of current slang, and cursing in a futuristic movie seemed ecessive, out of place and unecessary, dragged the movie down. not that I dont curse just seemed weird. All in all it was decent but to me just short of the mark. Hurt locker was much better.As far as the complaints from others about lack of special features, well I dont mind. im tired of blu ray load times and all the bull crap you have to swim through to finally get to the movie. no special features, no commercials no previews suits me fine."
3,Has anyone seen FernGulley? - Bill Kroyer aught to be asking JC,"I liked this film - a LOT, - THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT IN 1992! - This film is FernGully from start to finish - even the bulldozers etc are straight out of FernGulley, and the tree, and the blue people (except of course in FernGully they have wings), JC you really aught to be ashamed!!"
3,Avatar review,"Long story short: The effects are stunning but the story stinks like year-old hamburgers. It's the same tired old story we heard again & again. Overall,buy it if you are a fan of effects but don't listen to the story. I give this movie a 5 out of 10."
2,I've seen all this before....,"This movie is a derivation of everything you've ever seen before.Avatar=Alien (with Sig. Weaver)+Star Wars 1(with blue but less annoying race of Jar Jar Binks)+Harry Potter(flying dragons)+Disney movies (over saturated color and animation)+Top Gun (what's with the US Marine's schtick in all these invade-um movies anyway?)Okay Mr. Cameron, I see that you are getting really good with computer animation....I get it (hence the additional star in the rating).The problem is that I sat there fore 2 hours, THINKING that I was watching computer animation.I'm off to see the Hurt Locker now....atleast there will be a decent story."
4,Good Quality fast shipping,The blue ray acts as both the 3d and regular version. The bonus dvd is nice. No digital copy like a lot of movies do.
5,Avatar Blue Ray,"Outstanding.....Viewed on my 48"" TV, Blue ray and Bose surround sound system in my darkened family room and it was theater in an easy chair...I even picked up a popcorn and Pepsi to complete the scene...I saw this in a theater and it was just as great at home...Wow!!!!!!"
3,Surprised!,"I expected more seeing as it was a Panasonic exclusive for so long!It's good 3d but it didn't blow me away.The 3d in the wide angle shots is almost nonexistant, plenty in close ups though.The story sucks if you're familiar with american history and the character, scenery and minor plot points are is suspiciously close to Final Fantasy X!I only purchased this for what I thought I was missing."
3,Eh...,"I really like this movie! My only issue is that there are NO bonus features! No deleted scenes, no alternate endings, no behind-the-scenes... I miss that stuff! I wish I had got the special edition..."
2,terrible,there wasn't much about the movie that looked 3D. I expected to be blown away and was very disappointed. Thor was superb.
5,Great 3D graphics,It's an excellent 3d movieIt's a great storyI would recommend it to anyone into Sci Fi.It's a movie that looks good 2d and 3dI'll watch this many more times
5,movie,"We had seen this movie in the theatre, and when we shared it with friends whom hadn't seen it before, we all enjoyed it as a group."
5,It's a beautifully made 3D blu-ray movie!!,Just get it you wont be disappointed! it's the best 3D blu-ray movie you can buy. The effects are just as beautiful as in the theaters.
3,didnt play on sony bdp-s360,"I have a sony bdp-s360, and this bluray disc would not play on it. I'm sure theres been a firmware update since, but I wasnt able to play this at all at the time. ""had to"" return it. oh well. maybe I'll watch this somedayyou would think a trendy movie like this would be able to play on a popular brand bluray player, guess not. sorry but only 3 stars for that"
1,WILL NOT PLAY - DRM issues,WILL NOT PLAY in any of my two Samsung Blu-Ray players - even with firmware updates. Do a quick Google search and you will find many people are having problems with the playback of this disc because of new DRM schemes used on it.
1,"Avoid this Blu-ray disk, it doesn't work","I bought the disk. Would not play. Updated (with much pain) something called ""firmware"" on my blu-ray player. Still wouldn't play. Took disk back. They didn't want to refund my money for an ""open"" disk. Had to start shouting and demanding manager before they gave me my money back.I have heard horror stories about incompatible disks before, but my blu-ray player is almost new (LG BD270) and I didn't expect that I would have to be fiddling with it every other week to play a new disk that I bought. It's ridiculous, either blu-ray is crap technology, or there are a lot of companies selling blu-ray stuff that is crap. Whichever, I'm very sorry I spent any money on it."
1,No English subtitle and no closed caption - DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"We are very surprised that there is no English subtitle nor closed caption neither for these DVD of Avatar! That is a pure dirty trick on hearing disabled people and people who need to improve English reading skill when they buy DVDs without English subtitle. Also, we learned the truth dark secret for these DVD products - that Avatar DVDs came from China and they made those counterfeits DVDs since they were not capable to create English subtitle and closed caption. Please do not buy these DVDs! Wait till USA-made high-quality Ultimate Avatar DVDs with English subtitle and trailer too."
1,please release a version with ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!!,you need to consider international customers who dont have english as MOTHER TONGUE!!!!this is why i gave ONE star only
2,avatar james cameron,"I have been a fan of this movie until I saw a Japanese animation film Princess Mononoke, which was completed in 1997. The story line is incredibly identical... Sent chill to my spine. I am quite disappointed with this infringement of copy right. Cameron may be excellent to creat great movies with advanced technology. But his originality and digity as a one-of-a-kind director and writer truly took a nose dive..."
1,No Extras,What a rip-off. No extras until November release of another DVD. Don't buy this release - send the money grubbing studios a message. How much $$$$ money do they need to milk from consumers? This was the number one grossing movie of all time. Scum.
3,Cameron is a plagiarist for God's Sake!,"i can't believe that no one else has notice, so what do we have here?, ok let's see, the space travel, the remote unexplored world, the hibernation, the hostile extraterrestrials, the marines, the robot suits, Sigourney Weaver!!!! come on!!!! it sounds familiar to you? ....sure it is familiar, it sounds like....Aliens(1986) from James Cameron. Mr Cameron committed plagiarism but not only with his own work, the script about a soldier who betrayed his own people has nothing of new or original, it is the same premise that The last Samurai (2003) from Edward Zwick, so what's new here? only the visual effects that are in fact state of the art....Cameron let us debt after all these years since Titanic, he has no new ideas, only better special effects"
2,100% Visual..no idea why anyone would bother with this at home...,"Unless you own an IMAX screen I can't fathom why anyone would bother with this soon to be obsolete non-special edition of a film that will age horribly..No 3D, no features, no 300"" Screen? Pass... a better edition will come out but at that point you won't care.With bad characters, horrible dialogue and an unoriginal story this film is 100% reliant on visuals. Expect in a few years for it to look dated and be considered the turd in pretty 3D it is."
1,Why Cant they come out with at least 3D??,Well I guess I will Wait on this one because the next one comng in may is gonna be in 3D and it will have all the extra footage and content
1,Can't read disc,"I have the newest PS3 which plays all other blu-ray discs fine, but when it comes to Avatar I have to eject, put it in, wait, eject, put it in, at least 3 times before the disc can be recognized."
1,Awesome Movie - Terrible DVD Release (Where's the Scope?),"Several reviewers are talking about the lack of special features, bonus footage, etc. That's all fine and good, but I would gladly buy just the movie for now, then ""double dip"" and buy a version loaded with extras at a later date. But this release, though ""widescreen"" to a degree, is not presented in the theatrical CinemaScope aspect ratio of 2.35:1. I expect that they are using the IMAX version, which has a squarer screen than typical movie theaters. I purposefully didn't go see the movie in an IMAX theater because I enjoy the wide-widescreen of regular CinemaScope presentations... even if the screen isn't as gargantuan as IMAX.I'm disappointed because I love the movie, but I will wait for Fox to get their act together and release this movie the way I want to see it. It will probably sell like hotcakes, but I secretly hope it doesn't until they release a better version."
1,Terrible.,You can watch this in any version you want to. It is a terrible movie. It only serves to showcase how bright lights and loud noises can serve an audience. There is no story there is no point. This movie is a sin.
1,DVD (not Blu-Ray) won't play,"I've tried it on two DVD players and one PC DVD drive and it isn't recognized as a valid disk. Another PC DCD drive can play it, but only if I want to watch the damn thing on a 12 inch monitor. Great job, guys. Way to encourage downloading from the internet rather than buying. Thanks for stealing my money."
1,The Blueray Disk does not play,"Be prepared to buy new equipment, if you want to see it in HD. The Avatar Blue ray disk did not play in my two year old Sony Blue ray player, nor would it run in my one year old Dell Computer's player.Also the picture with the regular DVD is rather fuzzy and you cannot select a 16:9 wide screen version. So you stuck watching a cropped version of the film.The experience was a total disappointment and a massive waste of time trying to get it the run right."
3,"Very average, mundane story line with amazing special effects",My title pretty much wraps it up. The 1 star reviews are ridiculous but this is no way a 5 star movie. This is just Dances with Wolves with high end special effects.
2,Very Disappointed,"I love this movie and was so excited for the extra footage. When I received it, I watched it immediately and noticed that the video skips several times throughout playback. I suspect a faulty burn on this first issue. I am returning it and hoping to have more luck with the blu-ray version."
5,Good Movie,"Got the DVD as a Birthday gift for dad. We watched soon after it looked great. Haven't really gone into any of the special features, but movie looked great."
4,Great Value,I thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I have had the oportunity to see it. There is so much information on these three disc set that I have not watched everything. This movie is truly the evoultion of the next generation of science fiction movies. I am always finding something new that I overlooked after seeing the documentary portions of this set. The special effects and writing is truly an awesome piece of work.
2,Great Movie! Terrible Packaging,"The movie, of course, earns 5 stars. This particular edition, however earns only 2 stars. There are three versions of the movie on two discs, each version shown half on each of two discs with the third disc containing the so called Special Features which consist only of the deleted scenes which have been included in the extended versions of the movies. The edition could have been arranged with one full version of the movie on each of the discs and the deleted scenes for each version included on that version's disc. How easy."
3,"Boring and useless, but a nice fight at the end","The movie doesn't really go anywhere. Nothing interesting happens. There is no cool dialog. The only really good part of the movie is the big fight at the end. The animals are pretty cool too, since they all breath through blowholes on their neck or chest. Except the giant blue alien humanoids, who have noses for no apparent reason. I didn't find the computer graphics to be all that groundbreaking or breathtaking, but I do admit the motion capture to animate the movement was a nice touch.I regret paying $19.99 for this movie at Wal*Mart. I really should have waited for it to hit the $5 bin."
2,Cinematic Equivalent of Shock And Awe,"James Cameron is technically adept Salieri to a host of creative Mozarts, looting sci-fi/fantasy lore for gems, wrapping them loosely around the skeleton plot of Dances With Wolves, sprinkling green and transhumanist propaganda, and using modern SFX to rub your nose in the result: a cinematic equivalent of Shock And Awe. One possible benefit is that CG SFX and trite cliches have been taken about as far as they can go as a cover for lack of substance. People will only sink their teeth into wax fruit so many times.That said, it was a pleasure to see Sigourney Weaver again. She's a terrific actress.The movie is clearer and sharper without 3D, which was distracting and made my eyes hurt."
3,"Entertaining, but....","It is a very entertaining movie, fun to watch. But the best movie ever made? Oh, please. I didn't see it in 3-D, and if people say it's only great in 3-D, well that should tell you something. The CG effects were pretty cool, especially the Na'vi creatures. But everything else looked very cartoon-ish, including all the other native creatures and plants. The night time scenery looked straight out of a Disneyland ride, full of florescent paint, like a black light poster from the 60's. The script was dreadful. I can't believe it was written by the same guy who did ""Aliens"" which had some of the wittiest dialog in a movie. They were trying for the same effect here, but every word seemed forced and unnatural. And another thing, why the African sounding score? OK, one more thing. Am I the only one who finds Sam Worthington extremely dull?"
4,It's a good film.,"Not a great one mine, James Cameron's main problem is similar to george lucas's, he writes bad dialogue. Some of the dialogue made me cringe in embarresment. Once a directors head get's too big and he does not illicit decent help in writing a screenplay things can end up like this.I won't rehash the story as hundreds of people which nothing else to do have done so. It is an enjoyable film but not a great one.I enjoyed it and saw it.I saw it 3 times.It was good, very american though which I expected with Jim Cameron at the helm.Every detail was there.Pandora.The blue things.They had real eyes.I wish it had more adult scenes though and the ending was very lion king.Zoe is a gorgeous woman, I'd like to have seen her as nature intended in the film.I live in Australia so was happy with Sam's performance.Enjoy Avatar."
3,"Love the film, hate the absence of extras",This is still a great movie but I do wish I had read these reviews before purchasing it. Really looked forward to the extras and commentaries only to find them missing and will have to buy it again.
5,Avatar blue ray,The combo pack price was much lower than I could even get at Walmart or other discounters for the same SCU
1,Product never received.,"The item was never received. Sure wish there was a way to talk to a human at Amazon....i will forever tell all folks how I was ripped off, and willl never buy from them again."
2,Very unorginal,This movie is very unoriginal. Its like that movie Pocahontas but with blue cats in it. It has cool graphics and the military tech stuff is cool. But I should of rented this instead of buying it.
3,DVD would not play all the way through - second one better,"I like the movie, the extra scenes in the extended version and the format in which you can view them separately if you want. If you liked Avatar you will love the extended collector's edition. The first set of dvds did not play all the way through. I return it, which was a painless process, and got a new dvd set in just two days. This new set is much better."
2,The Matrix Meets Pocahontas - Badly,"Avatar is the Matrix meets Pocahontas on the planet Endor with a GI Joe Corporate bad guy. The movie is an incongruous mixture of other films. The Matrix, Star Wars, other films borrowed ideas (e.g. Apocalypto), and maybe even GI Joe and Pocahontas - were novel when introduced. Here they are replayed to cover a nonsensical and incoherent story line. I broke out laughing during the movie over how sadly predictable is the story. I however could not have predicted the regular needless profanity, occult environmentalism, and the hero ""mating"" with a female who is engaged to the future chief. The graphics are magnificent. The acting is formulaic and stereotypical. For adults this movie is a waste of time and for children lessons in bad behavior."
1,Movie = 5 stars... double dipping practice = -4 stars totaling 1 star!,"I fell for it... but they aren't gonna get me twice. I was excited to get the movie so I pre-ordered it well over a month ago expecting it to be like most blu-ray releases (special features, etc...). Obviously I was wrong. They aren't gonna get me a 2nd time though... I'm not gonna re-purchase it when they try and rape my wallet with a new release with special features. I should have just waited (like you all should). Don't fall for the double-dipping that these studios are doing now... let 'em know you won't stand for it! I sure won't!"
1,this isnt the 3D version....,"you guys need to look information up before you start going crazy. They have said that it is a stretch that the 3D version will come out this year. This first version will be the movie only, no special features or 3D or anything. Wait till november when the version with special features is coming out or wait till next 2011 when the 3D version will come out."
5,It's a five star movie.,"GROW UP!! Don't rate the movie one star just because you lack the self-control to wait for the release that you really want. Pretty much all film makers do this stuff. On a film like Avatar, which cost SO much to make, they have to pull these marketing ploys to make their money back and earn a profit. Keep in mind that these profits go to help fund other movies sometimes! Film companies put out dozens of movies, most of them flop or barely make their money back-- when they get a hit they have to cash in. It's just reality.Anyway, back to the main point of a review. The movie is awesome. Buy it! That is, unless you want the 3D version, in which case you should exercise some self control and wait for the next release. Most people don't have 3d tvs and aren't going to get one probably for years, so this version is just fine for most."
1,Poor Edition of the Film,"While I thought Avatar was certainly enjoyable as a film, this DVD/BLU-RAY release of Avatar is very poor. The studio has quite deliberately not included any additional features or content, so that they can get people to buy a second ""special edition"" Avatar DVD/BLU-RAY at a later date. I recommend skipping this edition of Avatar completely. I may even skip the inevitable ""special edition"" because I'm so turned off by the studio's behavior."
2,A Tired Story,"Corporate man is bad.Military man is savage.Scientists have the best intentions.Natives are innocent, pure, and peaceful.There is no God, only Mother nature.Sound like something you've heard before coming from Hollywood? Maybe about 10,000 times?"
1,Avatar....what a WASTE of time!!,"Quite possibly one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, and way too long on top of that! The CGI was good, but way over used and made the movie feel like a bad video game. Acting was terrible, especially from someone as well known for her acting in Alien, Sigourney Weaver, and the plot was SO cliched as to be ridiculous! Dances With Wolves in Space is how I see this film, and it's an insult to compare this POS to Kevin Costner's EPIC movie! I absolutely HATED this movie, and will never see it again, nor any possible sequels. Cameron has made some classics, but this one is NOT in that group!!"
1,DANCES WITH WOLVES REMAKE/COWBOY&INDIANS,"Nothing but a Dances with Wolves remake,(by the way Dances with Wolves is 100 times better than Avatar anyday.) I went to the theater to see this movie, I left when i saw it was nothing but a remake of Dances with Wolves. Whats really cool about this movie is the Academy Awards/Oscars knew what this movie was, GRATS and THANKS to them for knowing. If you really want to see this movie for what it is watch Dances with Wolves (Winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Directing and Best Picture) By the way Dances with Wolves just came out on Blu-ray (Dances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Extended Cut) [Blu-ray] (1990))."
1,"Too late, i already bought a blu ray.",Thanks to their exclusive deal with 1 hardware company i couldn't buy this when i cared most about the film. I bought the extended blu ray andwon't be springing for it again.It's just not that good.
2,meh,"The movie was not that good, nor were the cinematics. They were just average. Maybe the 3D was OK, but that isn't in this disc. In fact, nothing is on the disc except the movie.I like how they kick off earth day with the sale of these discs when they are just going to try to sell them all over again when they releases all the extended versions with extras and 3D in a few months. All of these plastic DVDs and cases that people will probably have double of will look real nice in a landfill somewhere."
1,I'd give this zero stars because of the greed this release represents,"No matter how great a movie is, releasing a bare bones DVD is pure greed and a rip off!!! I'll wait for the inevitable special release. Nah, on second thought I won't spend a red cent on any edition of this DVD because of of greedy executives insultingly releasing this bare bones rip off. Studios, get a grip and face reality, soon everyone will stop going to movies and watch on-line! Can you say pirated copy? I'm always willing to pay for something I like, but this is just another way of screwing the public and I for one will not bend over."
1,Over ACTED ecology message,"I felt this gimmick of a movie was a joke. Let's get the mean developers invading the ""Alien"" planet for the ""gasoline"". Sure, the effects were well done. But, the story was nothing new."
5,more is better,"what else can be said that Senor Zoidbergo did already say?I enjoyed the extra 15 minutes that seemed like longer to me. it was interesting seeing the Na'vi destroy the vehicles that destroyed their trees. in the original version they never did, which made the humans all that more ruthless,with the aireal shot of Jake and Neyteti hunting on Ecrans it made it more ""Dances with Wolves"" then ever before,the begining of the extended cut, n Earth, gave you a feeling of what Jake was telling us about how we ""killed our Mother"" was all aboutI would enjoy this movie even if it were 5 hours long, the blu ray aspect made it all that much more beautiful. I have no intentions of watching a 3D version as I am blind in my right eye and won't be able to enjoy the effects, so this is the version i am going to be most happy with"
1,Not sure it was worth the $5 Panasonic paid me to take it.,"As many others have pointed out, a movie like this without trailers, features, etc is really lame.Of course I never would have paid for it but it is a fine example of how a major company canteam up with a major movie maker to bilk the public. If I read that he's giving all ofhis proceeds from this pathetic effort to Global Green, maybe I'll change my mind."
2,Pretty colors not much else.,"The story line sucks. It's almost like he tried to take the best thing from final fantasy video games, and halo and make a movie out of it. Predicitable outcome. This movie wasn't half the hype people made it out to be. Your money could be much better spent. This is mediocre at best."
3,NO SPECIAL FEATURES!,"Great movie but NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!! I would have been willing to wait for the special feature version. It's just another way for them to make money! MAYBE they couldn't get all the stuff together for the SF so they decided to release just the movie. But I think if they had explained it, the fans would have understood. Now we have to buy the movie all over again when the SF version comes out. More money needlessly going out the window.Conclusion: Great movie, poor public relations!"
3,"Wait for the ""final"" Blu-ray version","If you just want to see the regular movie in standard 16:9 format, then this disk is fine. Nice quality transfer, 1080p, no promos or commercials. If, like me, you have a full home theatre system that utilizes the 2.35 to 1 movie aspect ratio that most high-end Blu-ray disks feature, then you'll be dissapointed. You really notice the cropping of the sides of the film to fit the 16:9 format on a movie of this scope. Also missing are a ""Director's cut"" longer version, which most James Cameron movies are known for when released on disk. On many - such as Terminator 2, Aliens and The Abyss - the longer home version makes a huge impact when viewing the movie. Hopfully the next Blu-ray version will contain all of this - it's just too bad it wasn't on this release."
2,Maybe the biggest ripoffski ever made...,"...and I say that because it borrows so heavily from rock artist Roger Dean's work as to not stand up as the work of James Cameron. Specific scenes are actually exactly the same as various paintings by Roger Dean which is a disgrace, in my book. Oh the film rocks alright, but primarily because of the sequences that take place on the alien world the human characters are attempting to free of its natural resources. These sequences are brilliantly colorful, and completely appropriated from Roger Dean's ""Dragon Dreams"", and lets not forget the blue aliens in the Star War's saga by George Lucas. In that sense the film is the most transparent attempt to rip off other creative people I have ever seen. I don't believe any of the artistic folk he borrowed work from were in on the Avatar film project. The 3D looks great but in light of how he accomplished his task, it looks very weak in the overall analysis. Kids will love it, completely."
5,A WHOLE NEW WORLD,"AVATAR is unlike any film I've ever seen. The envisioning of Pandora itself is mind-boggling; the performance capture effects unlike anything previously seen; while the script is nothing overly outstanding, the movie's epic scale and sheer entertainment value is what movie-making should be and ultimately should have won Oscars for both Cameron and the Best Picture. It's an amazing feat."
3,Avatar,Not my cup of tea but our teenage daughter and her father think it's a great movie. A little too removed from reality for me.
2,What the?,What the heck was all the hype over this movie about?What a boring story line. Would not recommend it.
1,Unsatisfied,Well I thaught I was buying the DVD plus blueray and digital copy and was upset that I paid so much for just the 3d disc and now they are in the stores for less than half the price I bought it off of amazon for
4,Simple but beautiful movie.,"I couldnt see Avatar on the big screen but even on a 32"" LCD all the money they put into the movie really pays off. I'm sure the patents on the technology will be making people a fortune for years to come. The story/plot is full of cliches that have been done in many other movies, just with the added avatar twist. It also lacks a really compelling villain. Just the typical hardline military type. But then Camerons movies are always that way. Simple stories but well done and Avatar was worth adding to my small bluray collection.I had guessed at what the last scene was going to be even before I hit 'play'."
3,It's already out in Mexico :P,"Just wanted to say that I came back from department store and they already have the DVD and Blu-ray of the movie for sale, but it is pretty bare bones package it is cool as the quality of the image is amazing on HD but it should be good enough for people that missed it in the theaters.I picked it up as a present for my girlfriend and as an excuse to watch it until I get the 3D release version coming later. You can do that if you want to wait but also can't wait to see it."
5,Finally in 3D,I saw the originally in I Max 3D the first time 2nd time regular 3D great experience. . Watching in regular 2D is just not the same. It's about time
5,"Great movie, great price",I love the extended version and wish the deleted scenes had been completed and also included in the movie. It's a great movie and longer is even better.
5,Great buy,Absolutely a great buy. This is a movie my family will watch over and over. Blu-ray makes it feel like you're seeing it in the theater!
5,Amazing!,"I have had a 3d TV for over a year now, waiting for this movie to come out in 3d. Its too bad that you can't just buy it in the store, but Panasonic has rights until Feb 2012, last i heard. I have previously watched ""Open Season"", ""Monster House"", ""Grand Canyon Adventure"", ""Dispicible Me"", and a few other 3d blu-rays on my TV, but this has better 3d effects than the other 3d blu-rays. The only thing that compares in my opinion, and has even better 3d effects than this movie is Avatar for the X-box 360. You must have the HDMI-out X-box for it to work and of course a 3d-tv and stereoscopic 3d glasses. My setup is a 73"" Mitsubishi DLP, with a Samsung 3d blu-ray player and an X-box 360.I'm not going to go into how the movie was, i'm sure anyone reading this has already seen it. If you haven't, rent it. Then determine if you like it enough to buy it in 3d. I really enjoyed the film."
5,BluRay 3 disc Extended Cut set is fantastic!!!,"I waited for this set all year. I have a 60"" Sony 1080P HDTV and PS3 BluRay player, but no 3D capability. So, this was the version I have been waiting for. I had the wisdom and patience to NOT buy the earlier versions, knowing this version would come out at some time. I am very happy with this set.For those of you that bought the DVD version and found that the movie is split over two disc, realize there is only so much capacity on the DVD format. With this being a 3 hour move with multiple versions and awesome video/sound quality, it was necessary to use two discs for the DVD version.Know that the BluRay version does not have to make this sacrifice and all three versions of Avatar are on 1 disc. BluRay has much more storage capacity than DVD. So, there is your reason to upgrade to BluRay!"
3,INSERT COIN,"Avatar (2009).........CGI at its finest. You'll see the latest computer generated image technology. This movie is visually stunning, in some cases breathtaking, but the story suffers while the special effects are on display. George Lucas once said, ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing"". Years after he said that, he went on to make the Star Wars prequels, which were heavy on special effects and CGI while the stories suffered. I like the prequels, but they don't compare to the original trilogy. It seems that James Cameron has fallen into this mode as well, at least in this film. Great movie visually, mediocre story.This movie will make you feel like you're watching a video game. It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, especially Episodes I and II, and also King Kong (2005).Do I recommend this movie? I guess so. Sorta.If you like this sort of stuff, then...INSERT COIN - 25 cents."
4,The Old West is still alive,"Spoiler! This movie takes place in the Black Hills of South Dakota after Lt. Colonel George Custer announces the finding of gold and sets off the gold rush. The government decides that the Indians are pesky obstacles in the way of getting to the gold and need to be dealt with and forcibly if necessary. Custer does his best to destroy the Indians but is defeated at the Battle of Little Big Horn.""Avatar 2"" will deal with the Indians being forcibly relocated to reservations without the possibility of creating casinos.Okay, ignoring all of that, the movie can be enjoyed for its stunning visual effects and that is, after all, why we want to watch it in 3D."
3,Compelling enough for usd$15 if u already like the movie.,"This is for the extended Bluray 3-discs.Loved the original movie so waited until this extended version gets cheap enough to purchase, paid $22 but I really feel it only worth $15.The extra materials are not that compelling. The deleted scenes are mostly un-finished. Motion capture is not new technology. In comparison, the ABYSS special edition had better extras, and this Extended release is not nearly as compelling as the Extended ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND inside spaceship (must see).Pay usd$15, no more."
3,Politcally Correct Hyperbole . . .,"I viewed this movie when it was in theaters - in 3D. The movie is very well made.I do not like this movie. The notion, as put forth by this movie, is that malicious corporations destroy the habitat of an entire planet. With this story, the movie pushes the ultimate in politically correct (and wrong!) hyperbole. And I have a big problem with the simple-mindedness of this politically correct story."
2,Milking the cow,"That could be me that cow. But I'll happily wait for the original edition(with all the extra's) and not this watered down 2D version. Still waiting for the ""ultimate"" Star Wars too. Already 20 years or so. I hope I don't have to wait this long for Avatar. I guess the-powers-that-be have not seen enough return of investment."
1,How many versions does it take to get to the bottom of your wallet?,"I can only give this item 1 star.If the cost in the theaters wasn't prohibitive enough.How many versions of the same DVD can you release trying to milk as much money out of unwary consumers as you can.This release does not have any 3d content.I'm sure next spring their will be a grand Re-Release with all new features ""Never Seen Before"" in 3d.Be like me and send a notice to the film companies. (Not interested)I'll wait until a full version comes out with all I want.Until then Nada.As to the movie itself.The special effects were FANTASTIC in full 3-d in the theater.It truly looked like a completely different world.It was the only selling point to this movie.I had one friend who saw it several times because it ""looked so pretty"".The story line was pretty basic and had no new ideas. It only repeated what we've seen in our own history.There were no plot twists and the film was very predictable throughout."
2,BE CAREFUL!!!!!,"As it turns out, Fox has craftily decided to milk ""Avatar"" for every possibly penny, since the debut DVD/blu-ray will be a bare-bones release -- and it will be one of the first major films to appear in home video without any of the regular special features, such as theatrical trailers, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.If you want all the extra features, you'll have to wait until November, when you can buy a second ""Avatar"" DVD, currently titled the ""Ultimate Edition,"" which will include all of the fancy stuff. And then, if you have really deep pockets, you can come back to the video store next year and buy a third, 3-D, version of the DVD.So in a nut shell... This Blu-ray/DVD release JUST has the movie on it! NOTHING ELSE. NO EXTRAS, NO TRAILERS, NO SPECIAL FEATURES."
4,Avatar,Received a new 3-disc DVD of Avatar. Cannot comment on it as yet because I have not had time to watch it. Arivved in a timely manner and was reasonably priced.
4,Avatar Collector's Edition,"The Collector's Edition of Avatar is an awesome release for the fans of Avatar. The case is beautiful and the deleted scenes more than worth the time to go through. They fill in so much of Norm's character development and the reason behind his and Jake's initial conflicts. **SPOILER ALERT** Did you know that a love affair with Trudy is what turns his mood around?? Ya, HUGE surprise for me too. **END SPOILER ALERT**I am however dissapointed that this edition did not come with a digital copy for my computer so that I can take it on the road with me. I am also dissapointed that some of the more advanced deleted scenes were not incorporated into this edition... is this a marketing ploy to release a ""Super-extended Die-hard Collector's Edition""? I wouldn't be surprised, and as a result, my brother may get this edition as a gift like my father received my original lol"
4,NICE COMBO !!,"About this, just that`s fine , but i have to tell you something weird happended to me with blu disco , i got a player samsung bd-p1600 since january 2010, it plays normally other movies in format blu disc, hence i think there is no problem with it, however it plays ""avatar- blu disc "" the first time ok , but the second time when my daughter wanted see, it pops a message from the disc sayin that i have to up date my player in order to can play that movie !!, because i already got the first experience i have to try play the disco several times until achieve my purpose , and i did it !! consider this detail if you got the same little problem someday."
3,"Doesn't quite transfer to my 46"" screen","I saw this in the theatres (like everybody else under the sun I suppose) so I picked this up to watch it again. There aer a ton of extras and an extended cut in this package but you know, the visual spectacle doesn't quite do the business on television, even in Blu-Ray. The movie's plot is pretty thin, the acting isn't all that special, and Cameron's directing isn't all that wonderful beyond the special effects.If this was your favourite movie ever, then by all means splash out for this package. You'll love the extras, the deleted scenes, and so forth. But if you haven't seen this movie yet, wait for the Imax re-release. This is a work best viewed with goofy 3D glasses on a screen bigger than 46 feet, not the 46-inch TV currently hanging in my living room."
1,This edition does NOT include special features.,"This release is the movie only, no special features, no extras, no nothing. Absolute waste of your money unless you don't care about special features."
1,DRM and encraption,These Bluray discs will not play in any of my computers or my Bluray player at home. DO NOT BUY unless you want to have three overpriced coasters.
5,Excellent,"This movie is truly superb. A lot of people make comparisons between this movie and Pocahontas, and they are very similar, but I there is a key difference which makes this movie so great. The protagonist in this story becomes one of the natives. He learns their ways, learns their language, learns their heart. He understands who the natives are and why the live as they do."
5,Outstanding DVD,I had not seen this movie at the theatres but was anticipating it's release on DVD. I ordered the Blue-ray set from Amazon as soon as it became available and have been very happy with the purchase. The quality of the DVD's is excellent and the movie is thoroughly entertaining. This movie is visually stunning with very good special effects and a good story line.
5,Best Blu-Ray disk of all time !,"Wow, this is a solid five star rated blu-ray and anyone who gave it a one star rating must have a mental disorder. It has the perfect aspect ratio of 1.78:1 for my four 1080p HDTVs and it is the best entertainment bargain so far in the digital age."
4,still the best even on the mere bluray.,"How can i review this wonderful movie when I've visited Pandora twice in Imax 3-D!? At worst, it's a jolly good yarn and up there with the best of action and Indiana Jones genres. Now we can dream on. More experiences will have to reach this high high and high...Hope for wonderous projects.Amazonazing!!"
5,WOW!,"Absolutely outstanding movie . . . it does so well mixing the animation with the real life, you lose the delineation between the two. I heard so much hype around this movie that I was a little sceptical, but it's now one of my favorites.NOTE: My home theater is 106"" of HD, with great surround sound. I'm sure this has a little to do with how amazing my children and I found the experience. ;)Amazon, as usual, shipped it quick and it was exactly as expected."
4,"It's 20 bucks guys, settle down","Great movie, great price on Amazon. It's $20 - $40 less than I paid to see it in IMAX 3d with my family. Believe it or not, there's a lot of people who don't give a lick about 'extra features' though I did knock it down 1 star due to a lack of features, but not 4! Fantastic sound, flawless BR production. This makes Star Trek look like VHS! Between now and Christmas, I'm pretty sure I can get another $40 up for Ultimate. Until then, I'll watch this a few times and enjoy every second of it. So should you."
3,Do Not BUY!!!!!!!,"I'm only giving this movie 3 stars because it was a great movie. As far as the Bluray Release, this is Junk. It only comes with the Movie (bare bones) I starting to understand why people pirate these movies. this is a half ass release.. Waste your Money Else Where"
1,Avatar 3D Blu Ray,"OMG ** What a let down - the Avatar 3d Blu Ray - was rushed or something - because there is no real visual 3D - no depth, no high grade color, or sound....... complete let down ** I wish I would have waited on my purchase - because after people view this 3D movie - the price is going to dropped considerably - infact I wouldn't buy the 3D if it was 15 bucks. I how they are going to release a true Avatar 3D Blu Ray."
4,DVD + BD version of Avatar 2d in one box...,"happy to have gotten two versions for the great price.No frills thoughs. It's just the movie with a simple navigation menu... but still... both a dvd and a blu-ray disc for just $20, couldn't pass it up!"
5,Avatar,"Ordering was easy, and the movie I was ordering was just what I was looking for. Transit time was quick."
3,"Great effects, ok movie","This movies is all effects. The effects, the beauty is amazing. However the story line is ok at best.I did not see the movie in the theater, but we did get the blu ray as soon as it came out.I am not disappointed in the purchase or the movie, there just isn't much memorable or striking about the movie outside of the effects.The movie is harsh and very violent in parts."
4,A must have if you enjoy 3D,"This is the gold standard for a visually entertaining movie. The story line is so-so, but the film still entertains because of the visual presentation. Would have given it 5 stars, but story is just okay."
4,Great film,yes we love this film in 3D it is just too bad it did not include the family audio. To cut out all of the obscene words.Good buy and delivered in excellent condition.Thank you
5,"Great 3D,","The movie came sooner then expected, My husband had been begging for it in 3D for the longest. I just couldn't see paying 35 dollars here at local stores for one.So for 22 buck and a short wait it was worth it. Since my hubby is happy i happy.."
3,avatar 3d packaging,"I got this item I purchased in great time, barely a week from the purchase date. However, when I opened the shipping packaging I found my several problems. 1 was the sticker residue on the DVD sleeve. Personally, I like the artwork and packaging on a DVD as much as the DVD itself, and I'm sure I'm not alone on this. 2, one of the two clasps on the actual case was broken so the case does not close properly, making it rather difficult to put back into the sleeve without destroying the edges and just overall a pain in the butt because the case should snap shut and it does not. 3, when I opened the case, one of the discs was actually out of it's holder. That can probably be dismissed to shipping, but still it's annoying because I don't know if that happened to damage the disc in any way. The disc does play excellent but the packaging was unacceptable. The seller informed everyone the item was in ""awesome condition"". This is not the case. This DVD is in ""average"" condition at best."
1,Title was deceiving,"Title said the movie was 3D, so we purchased it. This movie was not in 3D! We only wanted the 3D version."
1,"Bought the latest James Cameron rip-off, Avatar 3D with 2d and 3d on same disc","Biggest scam around so please do not waste your money on it. In the latest Avatar (crappy theatrical version - no extended version) 3D the size of the 3D movie (on the disc) is only 13 GB, whereas the 2d version is 32 GB, data transfer rate while watching the crappy 3D version is only 7 to 12 MB/second! That is as bad as a DVD which is about 7 MB/second. James Cameron's movies are always the biggest rip-offs around, took like 20 years before a proper release of Titanic was released! Now the same with Avatar, the crooks behind him like to have you buy like 5 different versions before you get a proper release. So avoid this, I got it as a gift so it wasn't too bad for me."
4,Living Religions Review,"I related the Na'vi people as being indigenous people. They live amongst themselves and cherish the natural world as it is without desire to have more material goods. Marine Jake Sully is a paraplegic marine who decides to accept participating in a mission in a distant world called Pandora. Later he finds out that Parker Selfridge, a rich but greedy authoritive figure is going to ""Na'vi"" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. Jake will get the treatment he needs to restore him to walk again if he agrees to go to Pandora in the avatar disguise to get close enough to gather the precious material in the woodland. Unexpectantly Jake quickly falls in love with a beautiful alien named Neytiri. Jakes will have to fight inorder to aggressively get this material but he now has growth to love this beautiful new world along with Neytiri which causes him to questions his loyalty in order to decide what he should do."
1,Excellent movie BUSTED by heavy-handed DRM,"So I'm using VLC on Lubuntu 11.10, and while disk 2 seems to start mid-movie, disk 1 yields various closed loops that never allow me to actually start the show. This is the _only_ DVD I have that seems to be a problem. I'm going to remember ""FOX"" the next time I buy a DVD; they may be protecting the content-rights management, but this heavy-handed don't-trust-the-consumer approach just drives me away.Googling turned up many DRM issues with various setups; the responsibility for this belongs to FOX. So don't be surprised...."
5,Avatar,"Husband states it was better than Star Trek. He is a Star Trek & Star Wars fanatic, but says this one beats them all."
5,WOW,In 3D this is amazing! Also comes with Blue Ray and a down loadable version for your Ipad and stuff
5,Awesome Movie!!,"I bought the DVD/Blue Ray combo pack. I haven't tried out the DVD version, but the blue ray version plays great, and played DTS on my surround sound system. First video I played so far, that showed DTS instead of digital on the surround system display.The sound effects are awesome. Could hear the animals on different speakers to allow you to feel as if you was actually in the forest.And the movie itself, was also good. Science fiction isn't for everyone, so if you don't like to use some imagination and if you feel there couldn't be any other life out there other then our own, then you most likely won't enjoy this movie. But if you are open minded about other life out there, I would highly recommend this adventure.The ending I thought really turned out well. I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but I would have been very disappointed, if it turned out the other way."
4,A great Blue ray to have at the house,I don't often buy DVD's but I always like to have a few in the bookshelf for that lazy day movie fest. This is one of those movies.
2,ferngully + Dances with wolves + captain planet = Avatar,"The great special effects aside, the plot is just a mishmash of 2 older movies and a propoganda tv show. The movie is preachy, insisting that corporations are evil that activly try to pollute. It preaches that the millitary are a bunch of wanton killers that will slaughter innocents for minerals. The ""Hero"" teaches the poor innocents how to defend themselves. A bunch of flashey crap."
1,Awful Avatar,"I am sure many have bashed this movie and those who did are the most intelligent beings on earth. This is a movie plagiarized from Dances with Wolves, Apocalypse Now, Pocahontas, The New World, Phantom Menace. A failed epic in magnitude proportions. Corny, trite, mundane, silly, overlong, overacting all predictable. They should use this as a torture tool for suspects to watch it only once and expect a quick confession of their crimes. How many times does he have to say ""I will save your people"". No more sequel please!"
5,Avatar,"I loved this movie so much that I finally purchased it as part of my collection.avatar broke all bounds in the technology of movie making, of special effects and computer animation. It is a well worth movie to watch and to collect."
5,"Love it, love it, love it","I love this movie, I have watched it so many times. Still love it. Blu Ray is fantastic. I saw it the first time in the movie theatre in 3D. I don't have a 3D player at home, Blu ray is the next best thing."
1,DVD skips,"Was disappointed, first time watching the movie, I had to fast forward a few times due to the movie skipping."
1,terrible,"The movie was categorized as NEW when we purchased the item. My son wanted to buy me a Christmas gift and since I love this movie, he thought it would be perfect. He was shocked to discover that the movie was a burned disc that did not work with a paper cover!! What a dispicable thing to do! The seller did refund the purchase but I will never but anything there again!"
3,Great movie; worthless packaging,"I rented this movie initially rather than see it in a theatre because I wasn't thrilled with all the hype. My husband and I watched it two nights in a row before returning it, then bought this extended collector's edition. We both really love the movie, but whoever designed this packaging should be fired. It's a card stock sleeve enclosing a cardboard sleeve, enclosing a cardboard ""book"" with three slide-out card stock pull-outs that each house a disk. It's hard to separate any level of this packaging from the others, and disc 2 is already scratched from sliding in and out of its card stock sleeve, after only two or three viewings. VERY disappointing. I wish they'd put it in an accordian-type package that still contained the traditional plastic snap-in disc holders. Now our collection is essentially worthless because disc 2 skips and freezes badly in several very key sections. How do I replace one disc of a 3-disc collection?"
4,One of the best movies I have seen in 45 years. But no extras on Blu Ray,"The movie was just amazing - the story is O.K., but the visual effects are simply unbelievable. I bought the Blu Ray / DVD combo and was expecting some special footage at least on the Blu Ray - a huge disappointment that there is no ""making of"", no cast interviews, no take outs, nothing but the movie on the Blu Ray - not even any live internet content. How can something like that be missed? Almost as bad as not releasing the 3D version...Anyhow, $20 well spent - it was for sure not the last time I watched this movie."
5,The best movie ever,"The movie has great special effects. Everything is perfect. It is filled with action. It is one of the movies where you keep thinking it is over ,but something else happens to make another problem.Over all this is James Cameron's best movie and also the best movie ever."
1,Overhyped waste of time,"I dont understand the hype and praise surrounding this film. The story is derivative and cliche beyond belief. There isnt a tense or emotional moment in the entire movie. Its pacing is laborious and predictable. Theres so many laughable things about this movie. (Hair as a phallic interface..are you kidding?) The entire story is Dances With Wolves on an alien planet. (Whos native population speak english...of course) The dialog is right up there with Armageddon and Independence Day, yes...pure genius.Neon plants, hammerhead rhinos and glowing vines do not a movie make....its a dull story, VERY predictable and cringe worthy. I mean..""Get Some"" and ""Take that Bitch""..? Really? I havent laughed so hard since Battlefield Earth.*edit* I guess I missed the part about the Navi learning english from school set up by the corporation. Must have been when I dozed off."
1,Returned,"Returned this poorly packaged dvd due to major scratches. I liked the fancy hc book style, however, the cardboard pullouts has got to go. My 1st disk was fine, the 2nd skipped and the 3rd looked like it met sandpaper.Say the least, I asked for a refund and will not get one until it comes out in a better package. And, no, I did not buy the 1st release knowing it was going to be re-released in extended. It was a given ;)"
1,Just does not work!,"3D disc will not work in any 3D player period.Looking to get refund, will update.Stay away from this disc set."
5,Great movie,The graphics and 3 D effect was really worth the money. I think it is one of the best 3D movies of all time.
5,Avatar Blu Ray 3D+blu ray/DVD Combo Pack,Item was priced fairly and arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again. This movie will be a classic and is certainly one of the best 3D films yet made. The visuals and sound are stunning.
1,Foreign language,This DVD was Italian. You have to select English. I bought it for a 7 year old. No where on the site did it say it was not an English version. Now it will cost more to return it than to just keep it to give away. Italian anybody?
4,Well that was a surprise,"I have refused to watch this movie for its over the top sensationalistic promotion and other such idealistic reasons. Then I got roped into watching it, and was pleasantly surprised. Well thought out, beautifully laid out scenes and cinematography. Not a bad story line...though nothing real new either.I wouldn't put this in my top ten or anything but the work that was put into this production was quite evident and this film deserves the four stars I have given it.....and I don't give those out lightly ;)"
1,What are these morons thinking?,"To release Avatar this past spring with no 3D content was inexcusable particularly so much 3D content being release in other films. But to issue this again in November adding a third disk of ""special features"" and a ""directors cut"" that no one wants with no 3D content....they should shoot these morons! Send a message to Fox by NOT buying this! They are playing too many games with consumers.Don't bundle it with the purchase of a 3D plasma TV and don't say you are waiting for 3D technology in Blu-Ray players. 3D exists today in many titles. It works!"
1,More lame studio productions!,Simply dumb! Yet again another version not in 3D. Next to come basic 3D version to be followed by the Special Edition 3D. Then an anniversary edition at some point with things they could put on the disc now. If you plan to get a 3D set up don't waste your time on this.
5,AVATAR + 3D a real treat,"You may have seen AVATAR before in 2D, but until you see it in 3D, you have missed half the fun."
5,Great music,This music stands out in the movie. It's very fun to listen to as the indigenous sound will reveal itself in most of the songs. Very satisfying!
5,What a wonderful surprise!,"I heard Avatar was good. I ordered it because my TV went and took on Avatar never knowing.......Well, I ended up riverted in my seat for 2 hours absolute floored with this blue imaginary world. Ah, the art of imagination was to be admired with the bird scenes..so beautiful, so exciting.. A wonderful experience!"
5,WOW... Collector's Edition is the way to go!,"Great movie. The collector's edition completely tells the story, adding parts to the movie that were relevant making the movie a much more complete experience. Overall, I am pleased with this movie."
5,AVATAR THREE DISC EXTENDED COLLECTORS EDITION,"My review of this product,Excellent, we are very pleased big Avatar fans. The product came in good conditon, no complaints we are happyThank youLottie Da"
5,What can i say... WAS AMAZING!!,What can i say... WAS AMAZING!! When I had the opportunity to watch AVATAR I felt in love!! I watch it like 3 or 4 times more at cinema and then I got the DVD version. All was perfect!! The movie and the delivery. I'M RLLY HAPPY :'D
3,Double Dip! Good purchase if you don't already own,"I agree with many of the other negative reviewers. Although Avatar is a great movie and a technological achievement, with the original blu-ray released in April and this one not being in 3D, it's a disappointment. Why should we have get punished for buying the movie by having to re-buy it now? This is how it should have been released originally. They should take a cue from Disney and release it right the first time."
3,"Long on special effects, short on fresh plot","James Cameron once again proves he is a master director. The technical production values do excel. Special effects are just as ground breaking as the critics say. However, the plot is tired and recycled. It's essentially the story of Pocahontas. Indigenous man attacked by the evil white foreigners is the theme, and the secret superlative power of nature over western machine prevails. A completely new story would have been refreshing and thrilling. Instead we are given blue Smurf Indians in outer space."
1,worst movie of all time,"You would think with all the money that they put into makeing this movie, they would have given it a better plot. Special effects are awesome, but the movie is pretty boring. Worst movie of all time in my opinion."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN!,I was not really interested in seeing this movie at first because it was in 3D and I sometimes get vertigo but my husband encourage me to go see it with him and I can say that I was so completely immersed in this beautiful story that I forgot that it was in 3D. Such a beautiful story...I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good heartwarming movie.
4,Outstanding visuals,"Yes, you've heard correctly...Avatar does seem to run a little long. But it's well worth the time you'll spend watching it. James Cameron has outdone himself with the CGI spectacle he's created here. The Navi are very believable and the world they live in is rich and beautifully rendered. The storyline lacks a little at times, and even for an action star Sam Worthington seems a little wooden. Overall, though, it's an entertaining and stunning movie to watch."
4,Everything Pandora,"A great movie, in a great presentation.This edition has everything we need.Tons of information about the making of the movie.Three versions of the movie. Is that enough or what?The quality of video and audio is excellent.The packaging is great, with nice artworks.I recommended it."
2,"Over rated, big time.","Good effects, some good scenes, but overall a boring movie. This movie was also TOO LONG! It most likely me, but when you get past the hour and 45 minute mark, I've gotta get out of there. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this."
3,TrueHD audio not up to the mark,"The TrueHD audio is a piece of joke in this movie. The Bass is too low in the HD format. Even the compressed Dolby 5.1 sounds much better delivering greater bass than the TrueHD. This is the first time I have seen such poor HD audio encode. Probably because of the 24bit encoding. highdefdigest gave similar review as what I observed. Very disappointed!Quote from highdefdigest : ""On the other hand, the bass never really extends to the deepest registers, even when you expect (or need) it to. As a result, certain sequences, like the destruction of the Life Tree and the big action climax, are curiously uninvolving from an auditory standpoint."""
3,Avatar is Missing Bonus Material,"I purchased the movie Avatar and awaited excitedly for its arrival. It shipped within 24 hrs, however, the USPS list it for over 5 days.When it did arrive, I inserted it into the player and the only thing on the dvd was the movie. That's Good, yes... but I enjoy the Bonus Material. Isn't that why we all changed from VHS to DVD?"
2,Standard breaker?,"I wonder how many blu-ray players got returned (or in this day and age of easy obsolescence just got thrown out) after attempting to play Avatar. This is a no-frills, no extras release of the movie, so why was it produced with content that apparently did not play nicely with many blu-ray machines? Not every user is a techno-geek like me who would think to try a firmware update. Yes, the firmware update fixed the problem, but I'd like to know what fantastic technological wizardry is on display in this release to make it necessary to buck the blu-ray standard?"
5,Bare Bones - No extras,"Although I saw this in 3D at the theater, this version was still excellent. I only wish they included extras on the 2nd disk."
5,Feedback,Needs a 3D TV to get full effect. Just loved the movie and this transaction was perfect. Highly recommend to anyone.
3,ok movie,loved the 3d version very beautiful effects with all the bright and beautiful colors .....good movie to see at least once
5,"""Avatar"" Blu-ray 3D + DVD Combo Pack","Disc runs trouble-free for viewing. Picture and sound quality excellent, rivaling that of the theatrical showing. Would have preferred to purchase only the 3-D disc at hopefully a lower cost than combo pack containing same content on three different disc formats. Outer packaging contains gorgeous 3-D artwork."
2,Color Me Unimpressed,"It's a technical triumph but a storytelling disaster. I care more about story than special effects, so count me out."
2,Rent It; Do Not Buy This Version!!,"Most Blu Ray movies I will rent unless the movie or concert is something extrodinary enough that I will watch it more than 3-times. I bought this Avatar disk as a ""Pre-Order"" through Amazon, not being aware that it came without any special features. And to rub salt in the wound, an updated release is coming shortly with the complete package. I actually was more interested in the making of the movie than watching it again; how aggravating. Shame on Amazon & the Studio for deceiving it's loyal customers.Either the studio should make the updated version available at a substantial discount or the Amazon should have a trade in scenario for us early buy-in SUCKERS! I have a large home theater system and I will pay the price for quality entertainment, but this is over the top. And the studios complain about the public ripping them off..........I want a refund Amazon!"
1,FULL-PRICE???!!!! YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!,"One of the most complicated movies ever made, and there isn't one making-of doc, outtake, deleted scene, trailer, or commentary included on this release? Even the $5.99 Scooby-Doo DVD's my kid watches have something extra. Maybe if this release was priced the same as those, I'd buy it. MAYBE."
3,"beautifuly Done, OK story.","Visually and acoustically well done. Good acting, good editing, etc.Great as that all was, the story was just ok. The idea was pretty cool, but it just wasn't enthralling, and I felt the move was well over hyped.Worth renting and watching once or twice."
1,good movie but I got suckered,"I searched for 3d movies this came up so I bought it for 40+ dollars when it came I found it was not the 3d version it was the 2d version collector series(I should have read better) but it should not come up when you do a search for 3d blue ray movies!! I was quite pissed off, I did another search and the actuall 3d version came up and they wanted well over 100 dollars for it that is a bunch of crap no blue ray is worth that much and to pay 40+ bucks for a non 3d version I feel I got suckered!!!"
1,Amazon Video On Demand,"Amazon Video on Demand is a Total Rip Off ! After purchasing a Wi Fi enabled Blu Ray Player, at the end of the purchase, I was told I was entitled to a few free movies.NOT TRUE!Beware, Its one thing to say you are going to give a consumer a Promo, But to out right lie makes me want to Re-Think ALL future Purchases through Amazon.com.Reveremike"
1,would not play a second time on Samsung Blu Ray player,The first day I received the DVD I watched about 1 hour and the Blu Ray was very clear and had great color. I tried to watch the rest of the movie today and the screen had an error message stating that my Samsung DVD player needed to be upgraded. What is this? I purchased the DVD player less than 2 months ago. The plain DVD works in my player but it is not as colorful as the Blu Ray version.I am returning this DVD to Amazon for a refund. I have played dozens of other newly released Blu Ray discs and not experienced this problem.
5,Great Movie,"Bought this in 3D it was fantastic, was always a great sory but 3D just made it that much beeter can't wait for Avatar 2."
5,Finally !,Finally ! I could get this movie and on Blue-Ray and 3D. Great special affects and viewing it from the comfort of our couch makes this a must have. Enjoy !
1,Deceptive Marketing - NOT 3D,"I was looking for 3D movies to give to a friend who had just bought a new 3D TV. I searched in ""Movies & TV"" entering the search text ""3D"". I was extremely happy when I saw AVATAR in the list. When it arrived and we started to watch it we found this is NOT 3D. Very disappointed in the deceptive marketing of Amazon.com but let's face it, the bottom line is the paramount issue."
1,Thoroughly disappointing!,"I had seen Avatar over 6 times (twice in 3D, once in IMAX) before buying my first DVD; not to mention the cable versions of ""The Making of Avatar"". Anxiously waiting for the commercial DVD, and expecting to see the ""Behind the scenes"" in that first version -although slightly disappointed- I was happy to have my home version. I read earlier one review that said: ""Wait before you buy this. They are trying to milk every penny from this movie"". Then when this ""Three-Disk Version"" comes along, I send for it, thinking THIS is finally what I had been looking forward to. NOT by a long shot. I guess we'll have to wait until we no longer care to see it."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE A REAL FAN!!!,"To be clear, the movie's awesome & the 1-star rating pertains entirely to this money-grabbing scheme no doubt concocted by the 'powers-to-be' at the studios.Most fans, like myself, who have seen the movie multiple times should be angry with this teaser release - there's not a lick of extra feature, not even a perfunctory audio commentary! The better is yet to come, I hope."
1,wait for 3D release,"Blu-Ray 3D discs are supposed to be usable with existing Blu-Ray players, although of course you only see one of the two video ""channels"" (L or R). Thus it is not necessary to produce both a 2D and a 3D Blu-Ray release. Not as much content can be crammed onto each disc in 3D mode, but the marginal cost of adding another disc to the package is relatively small. (I'd prefer a 3D ""features"" disc over a DVD format copy or a so-called ""digital copy"".)"
1,subtitles,Once more if youn are English speaking you are unwanted as a customer.On NONE of aqny of the dvds are there subtitles in English.This must surely show the contempt in which we are held.There are many of us with poorbhearing who are tregarded as sub zero customers.DO NOT put any monies in their coffersPRINCE RAFAEL
2,A letdown on all fronts,Heard the movie was so-so but bought it anyway. I should have listened.1) Blu ray disc plays fine. DVD copy not at all!2) Predictable storyline. Totally unoriginal3) No special featuresAll in all a waste
3,Great potential BUT...,"We purchased this movie and watched it as a family....loved the movie but was totally disappointed with the language used in this film.Come on....can't a movie be made without all the trashy words used in this film. What a wonderful movie it could have been...I am not a square, but I value morals for our children on all age levels, and I know others do too."
5,As Advertised,"The movie is amazing, you get what you pay for. Glad it's finally available for wide release, been waiting forever, finally it word minimum."
1,"Ultimate edition arrives in November, 3D next year","This is a waist of money like the Lord of the rings one, just wait until November for the ultimate edition.Fox continues to pull back the layers of its release schedule for Avatar after yesterday's press event with director James Cameron, producer James Landau and Earth Day Network President Kathleen Rogers (above) as Reuters indicates the Blu-ray 3D version will arrive next year. What does 2010 hold for the most dedicated fans of Pandora? While the DVD and Blu-ray editions due April 22 will arrive stripped clean of any extras whatsoever, a registration code slipped in the case will give owners access to ""The AVATAR Program"" to view bonus content online, adopt a ""virtual hometree"" among the million being planted and other enticements to string them along connect this release with an ultimate edition due in November. Check the press release after the break for all the details and see if you can resist the urge to triple dip."
1,Extreme Disappointment,"By now, there is an expectation that there will be bonus materials of some sort on a Bluray disk, but in the case of this Avatar release there isn't a single shred of additional material to warrant a full price bluray disk."
3,This is like buying lord the rings and not the extended version.,The makers of Avatar have figured out how to milk its fans. This copy does not come with the extended 40 minutes. And it doesnt have a 3d option. So basically they want you to buy this twice. Expect this to be the future of movies. There excuse for no 3d option is that the technology hasn't reach the public yet. And yet I own Coraline on 3d and its all on 1 cd. Boooooooo to your way of thinking.
2,I'm holding out for the extended 3-D Edition!,"In 2-3 years once the 3-D home technology is perfected (and cheaper)I'll buy the Blu-Ray 3-D edition. For now I'll just rent this so my wife can finally see it.I already feel burned as now I want to REBUY many DVD titles in Blu-Ray format (some DVDs have only been watched once) and I'm starting to wonder if I should just scrap buying movies and just renting them.After all, with so many new movies coming out every week, how many times are we really going to watch the same movie over and over again in the next 10 years? For most of us just once or twice yet a lot of us feel we need to OWN it.Well, at least for me my Blu-Ray price point is $10 a movie or less. If it's not there now it will be soon enough.In a perfect world we would rent a movie for $1 and use the other $9 to help out somebody with REAL problems...but alas, we are definitely not in a perfect world!"
3,Good for all ages but typical story plot,"Before seeing this movie somebody mentioned its very much like the movie Ferngully. After watching it it is very colorful with a setting in a rainforest and the aborigine's protecting it from the hi-tech intruders. Though the story plot is typical you know whats going to happen next. As another reviewer mentioned he left after an hour into the movie, I did the same as well. More of a movie for the younger crowd. Would really like to see some originality in the movies being produced nowadays (other than a different setting which was creative on Camerons behalf) but they are what they are cause this is what sells =/ ..."
2,tkalistwelve,"I had not seen this movie until 8-12. I was totally disappointed. Ignoring the fact that it is obscenely overpackaged, the plot is totally predictable. In this future why is the ""corporation"" totally dependent on the military to defend its mining? Have humans learned so little about eological balance over the years needed to reach another planet? Are all sentient beings we encounter in the universe to be exterminated? The characters are stereotypes, and not good ones at that. The CG action did not look natural (Cameron should take some serious lessons from Peter Jackson). The ""bonuses"" are worthless. There are some beautiful scenes but I find more beauty in our real world.One viewing is enough for me. Don'waste your money on this set. Wait until you can buy the entire movie on one disc in a more traditional plain package."
2,DANCES WITH WOLVES IN SPACE!,"As much as I enjoy Cameron's visionary take on his films I'd have to say that Avatar is not his best work. In my opinion the storyline for Avatar is very, very similar to Dances with Wolves so I give Cameron a 1/2 point for originality. And honestly, Titanic was much more engaging for me than this film. Oh sure the 3D and special effects are without question cutting edge but that's about it. I can sit through Titanic many more times than I ever would though this lazy pile of artwork. Cameron should have given screenplay credit to Michael Blake. If you don't believe me compare the two films and see for yourself. On second thought Jimmy don't give Michael any credit. It surely must be an insult to take his wonderful novel idea and pepper it with flat, one-dimensional characters in some quasi-political correctness message."
4,"Very nice movie, except a couple of points","This movie is well made, entertaining, has a good story line. special effect is very good.the only thing is: why do movies always have to make the main character, for no reason at all, just have to be the best (no one can be better than him. he just have to be the best) -- like in this movie, he was first looked down upon by the tribe's girl's brother. And then towards the end of the movie, the main character became the only person who could master the biggest and strongest flying creature. Why him? He is just in that jungle for such a short time, yet he has to be the best. It feels too much like he just have to be the best.And what's more, why does the main character always have to go to the other tribe and make baby with the most desirable woman of that other tribe? This is true in the Last Samurai, Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves (can't remember the storyline exactly but it is along that line) Is it to satisfy some ego?"
1,"A remake of Disney's Pocahontas, but with aliens.","The entire movie plays out essentially with the exact same story line as Disney's pocahontas... but with aliens and absolutely brilliant CGI. The special effects are amazing... the story is bland and predictable. If you're looking for something pretty to stare at, this is great. If you're looking for movie with plot, substance or depth, this movie is not it."
5,Great film for all,"My husband and I saw this film twice in the theaters - something we've never done before. The price of going to the theater is so much higher than just renting it that even when we have really liked a show in the past we've gone at most one time to the theater and then possibly rented it after it came out on video. With Avatar, however, we LOVED the show so much that it was well worth the money to see it twice in 3-D. We had heard the plot wasn't very strong but when we saw it we didn't feel that way at all. It was engaging, fun and touching. If anything, we just didn't want to see the movie end - we wanted it to keep going. My husband loves sci-fi and I don't but we both loved it equally. Highly recommended you at least see it once - it's a great show!"
1,Do Not Buy This DVD!,"This DVD set comes with three versions of the movie plus extras. The reason I am suggesting no one else buy it is that all three versions are split between two discs. No matter which version of the movie you chose to watch you have to change discs in the middle of the movie and then wait for the intro, FBI warning, and menus to be displayed again before you can navigate to the second half of your movie!I just cannot believe that they would ruin a great film by packaging it that way!I will be donating my copy to my local library most likely!"
5,What you see is what you get.,"Don't let the 1-star reviews fool you. These people think they're somehow entitled to special editions upon release. When it comes to this release however, what you see is what you get - the DVD & Blu-ray theatrical releases in one pack. Nothing more, nothing less. If you want to wait for the extended cut, that's fine. You know it's coming. If you don't care and see nothing wrong with paying $20 for 2 copies of the movie, here you go."
5,Best Bluray release ever...,"I was growing tired of lackluster Bluray releases that seem barely better than the standard version -especially with upconversion. This movie delivers on all the promises of Bluray. Electronic stores should get a looping version of this DVD and watch their sales skyrocket. I was wondering what all the fuss was about with this movie and all I can say now is ""WOW!!""."
5,Avatar,A great sci-fi movie with spectaculare sceens that will take your breath away. (this ofcourse demand you have the oportunety to wiev this movie on Blueray disc and on a good screen and you have good sound system)
4,Avatar...........,"This is a very good movie. Plenty of action, plenty of well known actors and actress, brilliant colors and the special effects. You will watch over and over. When you want to watch. Don't wait..."
4,A Beautifully Made Film on Old Themes,"It's a technical masterpiece, overwhelming in its beauty. However, the story line is full of cliches. Essentially, it's Dances With Wolves in Space, with Fern Gully thrown in. I suspect that its beauty will be diminished when seen in DVD/Blue Ray on a TV screen simply because of the size difference, wherein you will miss details."
2,Boo,"As so many have stated before on here, this is a stunning movie. Thats where it ended for me. Im just amazed how gullible so many people were to this mess. It was too long and it felt like a mish mash of so many other films. Cameron comes off as a serious hack. He should have spent a little more time on the screenplay/story itself. The writing was bland, boring and quite amateur. I found myself even cringing at the dialogue especially Sigourney Weaver's. Best way to describe Avatar- Its like a very pretty girl with rotten teeth and bad gas....."
3,"Why 1.78, not 2.35 ??","But it's ok for the first time release.Just need to watch the movie, do not expect for special feature in this release!I like it since the picture is sharp and clear in this aspect ratio format.Fox, please make it in original theatrical aspect ratio ((2.35), in next release!!"
3,Just a great visual ... stollen from ROGER DEAN !!!,"Cameron put Matrix, Lord of Rings,Transformers,Apocalypto, etc. all in a computer and made a movie for teenagers. Some scenarios (like the floating islands) were STOLLEN from ROGER DEAN who made the LP's covers of progressive rock bands like YES in the 70 years. I saw Avatar in a analogic room and it had the quality of a DVD. I am sure in Blu-ray the visual will be great. Nothing more than this! The story is too weak ... I think american people should use better their brains or you don't know who put down the WTC ????*** 2010-april ... I saw Avatar today in Blu-ray. I just can say : Great, fantastic, amazing quality video and audio !!!"
1,Won't run in older Blu-Ray player,"I recommend you avoid purchasing the new blu-ray edition until you have ensured that it will work in your player, perhaps by first trying a rented copy or friend's copy of the movie in your BD player.The Avatar ""Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live"" fails to run in my freshly updated Samsung BD-P1400 player, with April 2010 firmware. In fact, the 2nd disk did play (mostly) with the 2007 firmware, but after the 2010 update, even the 2nd disk wouldn't work. Many other recent discs played well before and after."
4,3D version even better!,An entertaining film made even better with 3D. Hard core Sci-Fi fans need to chill; this movie isn't for them as there are some leaps of faith required. Avatar is visually engaging and makes you think twice about messing with Mother Nature. But those leaps of faith and 4th-grade character development temper ones enthusiasm.
2,blueray mistake,I've seen the movie before & loved it. looking forward to watching it again!!recevied a blueray DVD /Can't watch it.Do not have BLUERAY. Disappointed I guess a bad order on my part :(BJ
1,no good,this thing is much below expectation. Do not undestand all the fuss about it. could not watch the whole movie.
1,"quality so bad, I stopped watching it. 3d Avatar version","Very disappointed in the quality of the 3d DVD, color, 3d effects sharpness, is very poor. I own a lot of 3d movies, this seems like a bootleg copy that is poorly done. Wondering if some folks at the factory are getting greedy and swapping out the good ones for garbage. I found it unwatchable. update: I spent about 1/2 hour adjusting the settings on my tv, and it is coming in much better. However, I don't think that this should be neccessary, never had this problem before with my other 3d movies, and yes, my 3d blu-ray player is updated."
1,Borrrrrrring,"When I watched this movie, I thought it didn't have much of a story. The special effects were good but not great - pretty simple! After an hour of viewing the movie and having nothjing substantial develop, I gave up and turned it off. I'm glad I checked the DVD out of the library for no cost and didn't waste any money at the movies or buying the DVD. Although it received a lot of awards, most of the movies that receive awards are not that good. It made a lot of money but not from me."
1,my movie didn't work,"Right in the middle of my movie it froze. I looked at the disc and it had many scratches so it wouldn't read anything past about the middle of the movie. I'm not pleased, and I will never order anything from these people again!"
2,Great effects but a really stupid movie,"I'm sorry, but I thought this movie was really stupid. It had probably the poorest plot andstory line of any movie that I've seen in a long time. Especially one that was really hyped and hyped and hyped like it was. It just seemed to permeate with a lot of new age philosophiesbut you couldn't quite understand the point of it all, so this guy did this movie and what was he trying to tell everyone? For me the movie was so poorly done that all the incredible special effects didn't really make it work as a movie. IF you are going to see it to see a good movie - it honestly doesn't work as a movie. But if you want to see some pretty cool scenery and specialeffects work, I think they do a great job of that, and it is probably worth seeing for that reasonit was pretty good in that way."
3,Beautiful movie 3 Star storyline,I know some people might not agree with me but I found avatar at times boring. I actually nodded and my brother had to poke me to wake up. But that's not why I rate this movie three stars the movie is beautiful don't get me wrong but the storyline was nothing new. It was like the watching the white people taking the indians land which we all know happend see nothing new. Everyone told me how could this movie was so I went to see it I though the dialouge was cheesy for one I mean the army dude(name I can't rember.)he said something about juju beans and I'm like what? This is so cheesy. I'm a total scifi-fantasy junky and this just didn't appeal to me I guess I shouldn't have expected more and expected less.Ups-*The movie was beautiful*The acting was excellent*The action was alright*Glad I didn't pay for my ticketDown-*Cheesy dialouge*Storyline lacked*The ending wasn't much of a shocker*The movie takes forever to get into and its way too long
2,"Love the movie, loathe this version of the DVD","Two parts to this.The first is not exactly minor but I understand some things are beyond Amazon and shipping might be one of them.I was supposed to get this the day after the release. It was going to be a gift. Instead it showed up three days later.Forcing me to buy another present.When it finally shows up I hear the buzz....No extra features.No, the extra feature DVD will be out later this year....right on the heels of THIS plain Jane.Fortunately I did not open it so I can return it.And Amazon has a very painless return process.So, go rent it if you need a fix (I will) and wait for the new and improved version to come out.Unless you have plenty of loot or want to give this one away later when the better version hits the shelves later this year.As for the flick itself....I loved it."
2,sadly lacking,"...the blu-ray picture is spectacular, but lack of ANY disc extras ( not even the trailer , for gods sake! ) is sad and lame. I feel really ripped off, and they no doubt will be doing some sort of 'ultra' package in time for Christmas! Keep your normal DVD and give us some extras...shame on you 20th Century Fox!"
3,Beware,"There is a warning that this movie will not play on some Samsung Blu-ray players. This is true especially with the BD-C5500 model. The warning goes on to say that you must update your player's firmware, which I did. Still does not play! After many tries with a Samsung tech-rep we finally got the answer. THERE IS NO UPGRADE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE and you will only be able to watch the regular dvd version until such a time as Samsung comes up with another firmware upgrade (no estimate as to when). Anyway, it's a good movie!!!"
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!,"I MAY be weird someone younger that thirteen is reviewing this, but I saw it so...anyway, here's some things I will talk about.First, the pros:-Good computer graphics.-Cool creatures.Cons: Well, there is a few I must say.-First, the story was...well, okay.-It had ""Mother Nature"" mentioned in it.-Some parts were just too...harsh and intense.-It was kinda short.-It could have been longer!!! Why couldn't they make it longer??? If I were to make a movie, it could have been longer!-Also, somebody said ""It would make Avatar jealous"" as a review for the movie ""How to Train Your Dragon""Er, that's it. I just don't know exactly how to say that the movie ""Avatar"" could have been better. (Another crazy thing is that ""Avatar"" is coming out in theaters in ""special edition."" Nuts.)"
2,Very disturbing,"A marvelous technical movie, but very painful and upsetting to watch humans attempting to destroying another race and planet as they have done so often on earth."
2,Worst 3D DVD,"Our 3D DVD arrived and we could hardly wait to watch it. Very disappointing. Worst 3D we've seen yet. I don't even think it's really 3d. Great, clear picture and brings story alive but don't think it was 3D at all."
4,Avatar,"Bought this for a Christmas gift. Easy to order, good price. Didnt have to worry about it being back ordered. My son loved it."
1,Great computer effects + terrible plot = Bad Movie,Great computer effects + terrible plot = Bad Movie. Have we all gone so brain dead. Pretty computer graphics and all of a sudden no one can point out that this movie had a awful stript and terrible acting.
1,Overhyped and boring cartoony junk.,"It's like a 3 hour movie full of cliches you were already tired of 10 years ago, where humans are evil just for existing, and the military is especially evil, and the perfect holy pure infallible blue space cat people are perfect and pure and great at everything, and it just goes on like that for hours, and at they end they use bows and arrows to destroy insanely advanced ultra powerful military technology. The movie is basically calling you an idiot at that point."
1,Failed to load in 2 DVD blu ray decks,"Be SURE to test this DVD as soon as you get it. The return window is short, and our discs won't load in 2 DVD players. We're stuck with a bad product."
5,Great Buy,"I was very pleased to find the movie that I enjoyed so much in theaters available in this format, and especially on sale. The Blu-ray and DVD combo is great so there is no worry about having the correct format for a device and the slim, simple, and effecting way it was packaged worked wonderfully. Both disk look and sound great, so no complaints here!"
5,"Avatar (3-disc, extended collector's edition in Blu-ray)","This was an excellent purchase. The Blu-ray, extended Collector's Edition is probably the best deal going. The movie is so vivid in HD color and shows so much more than the first release. Too bad a sequel is not in the making. Great story line and acting. If you like sci-fi you will definitely love this movie."
3,Post-Titanic Stress Syndrome,"Avatar (2009) ***1/2 |C--162| D: James Cameron. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi. PG-13A visually stunning, epic, fantastic to look at sci-fi adventure looses something without a good story. Don't get me wrong, James Cameron's first film since the blockbuster TITANIC is no let down, it's just not the hype everyone says. Visually and technically it's amazing. With amazing state-of-the-art visual effects and beautiful CG backdrops. The action is great and it is hard to tell what it real and what isn't. But the story is pitiful. It's just a mishmash of DANCES WITH WOLVES and POCCAHONTUS. The action and effects are just fantastic, but other than that it's just average. Gets a lot of hype and over exaggerated praise because of the technological achievement. Even so, it became the highest grossing American film of all time and earned a Best Picture nomination."
5,Great Movie and the DVD worked,I have seen this movie many times and decided I would purchase the DVD. It was shipped within a few days of purchase and arrived in a timely manner. The basic DVD which is what I purchased comes with enough features for the average enthusiast. It plays fine. If you do not know the story line you must have just awakened from a coma. Once you get acquainted with this time I am sure you will find out all about it.
5,HD...Amazing,"This is my first HD movie with my HD TV. I have seen it before but the HD makes the characters look real! Sound was amazing too. The movie has humor, drama and great characters."
5,Great 3D adventure,"Although i have seen this movie several times, i decided to get it in 3D. It is great -- quality and of course the movie is good!#D is totally great!"
3,Beautiful but unoriginal,"Great effects! Wonderful display of visual imagination! BUT . . .I have to add my voice to the chorus of those singing ""I've seen this movie before!""The plot was simplistic, obvious and a mash-up of several other movies on the exact same subject. I found myself saying ""Yes, I already know that we humans get carried away in our greed and are capable of destroying a race of people to satisfy it. Tell me something that I don't know.""I would have liked to see a more traditional Sci-Fi exploration of the Na'vi culture. That's what I was interested in, not the thinly veiled message."
1,Please don't bother,"James Cameron has made one--count it, one--good film: 1984's ""Terminator.""""Avatar"" is a decidedly bad movie, one that could well be titled (descriptively) ""Interminable."" The only interesting feature of the film is the special effect work, and that is no better looking than many video games; it's hard to imagine anyone who could not imagine better effects, and there's no reason to bother watching this film, as the special effects will be par for the course in a matter of two or three years.The movie, mind, is not in any way a science fiction film: it's a flimsy fantasy full of utterly unconvincing characters and an utterly ridiculous, hopelessly anthropomorphic bunch of ""aliens."" Stay far away."
3,Where's the movie format version,"I don't know why they haven't produced this in the original movie format. Most movies today are shot in 2:40 to 1 ratio. They've only released all versions in the 1.78 to 1 ratio to fit widescreen TV's. Unless the movie version was only shot in 1:78 to 1 ratio (which I doubt) I plan to wait until they come out will the full lettrbox version, which will be the real movie version."
1,highly overrated,"this movie only made so much money because each ticket is $15.the special effects are incredibly over hyped its sickening.i didnt see anything new about it, other than jim cameron painting his people in his movie blue & wearing indian wear.cameron needs to stop making movies- his suck.oh, and they arent even his- he steals all of the stories.to ruin the movie in one sentence - 'dances with Pocahontas'"
5,Avatar,"can't get enough, this movie should be watched again and again, every time I see it I get goose bumps"
5,WOW,This was indeed a great movie. Even my husband (a self-named tough man) was misty at times. A must have for the movie buff.
2,Don't buy it wait for the extended version,after holding out on releasing the 3-D Blu-ray we are finally given a basic copy without any extras. This movie is three years old and the reason why 3-D movies are popular in the first place. If you are a proud owner of a 3-D television you understand how important this film is. The fact that after three years we are given only a stripped-down version is ridiculous. Especially when a full extended cut will be made available in a few months. It would be one thing if they were releasing this version of the film alongside a special edition for budget consumers. Instead they're trying to trick us into buying this version by saying it's a limited edition. If you really want to save a few dollars just by this addition at the half price used DVD store in a few months when people return it. We all know they are going to release a full 3-D version with the extended cut and the extra features eventually. After all this is the guy that re-released the Titanic in 3-D.
2,WOW what a letdown,"I put in this dvd,and WOW!!! what cool effects,cool colors,well cool everything.After the movie was over,my first reaction was anger.After thinking about it,I was just plain sad.Once again Hollywood took what could have been a cool concept,great ideas,and a pretty good story,and turned it into...The evil corperation,the horrable armed forces.All headed up by the worst thing to ever exist,not only on the face of the earth,but the whole solar system.The dreaded white male.This movie went even further than 2012 with the writers liberal views.Hollywood!WHY? can you not make a really cool product,entertain us,and leave your personel hate for a little over 50% of Americans out of it.A movie I could have enjoyed several times,Trashed."
1,This is not what I want,"I already have too damn many dvd's that I have also replaced with blu-ray. Just the blu-ray please, no dvd, no digital copy and lower the price!"
1,Warning: No Anamorphic widescreen version.,"This Blu-Ray unlike the cinematic version will not be available on widescreen. It will be cropped to fit your TV. HDTV 16:9 only and no 2.37 widescreen anamorphic now or EVER, even on the 3D version later this year. As a huge videophile looking forward to this release more than any other this year I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with james cameron's decision here. I will NOT be purchasing this consequently. Cameron, what were you thinking?"
3,EXTENDED DVD'S,OH THEY ADDED 18 MINUTES THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR THEY WILL DO THE SAME THING WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT A 3 OR 4 HOUR MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEY PUT IT ON THREE DISC WHERE THEY SHOULD OF JUST PUT THEM ON ONE DISC AND GIVE YOU ALL THREE IN THE SET BUT I GUESS THATS HOW THEY CHEAT YOU OUT OF MONEYWIAT A YEAR THEN BUY THE NEW COPY THEN
3,Matrix Trilogy in Fairytopia,"For the movie, I am not going to make myself an expert critic but I could see why it didn't fetch a lot of bald men at the ""O"". My young kids who are more than curious as always to see new home videos as heavily advertised as this were not as enthusiastic-one stayed to watch a little bit and left for bed, the other one never joined us but continued to finish another movie in the other room. Video/audio transfer is mediocre. I could see the layers on my 92"" inch screen! Colors and patterns are inconsistent. No 3D version yet. Audio is not 7.1 DTS-Master. Bonus features ?! Wow, this means we will shed more $$$ for future version/s! Didn't they already make a lot? Overall, hats off to Jim Cameron but I dare say that I was not impressed this time. But, buy this for the sake of keeping a copy of one of the most successful movies of all time!"
1,changing discs?????,"why did they not put one version per disc and the extras on a fourth???? i watch this with my grandchildren over and over and over and now we have to change disc and pick the version again. it's a real pain and totally not necessary. who thought this up and why???? they cannot watch by themselves, somebody has to come and change the discs. get a brain. my copy skips several places also. very, very disappointed."
1,$115? Good luck!,"You can get this free with a Panasonic BD player for $114 right now, so why anyone would pay that much for the movie alone makes no sense to me. I'll just wait and see what happens next month :-)"
4,Great movie to have!!!,"Look I know we are fans of this film... yes it has it's flaws, but really... if you want to buy this film... just to have a good time. Then do it!!! I will buy this version, and the extended version as well. Everything about this version is sound for now. Aspect Ratio is the way James Cameron wanted it to be. Remember people ""IMAX"". Remember Earth Day!!!! 4/22/2010."
5,One of the best movies I ever watched.,This movie is amazing! Even if you're not into Sci-Fi you gotta see this movie! There is violence but there is also a great moral and spiritual movie.
2,Disapointed!,"When you order from Europe you don't want a film that only can be played in US. In short I was sent a Region A version of the product, and the cover did not show this. I'm very disapointed."
1,Review,I have not recieved this item yet. My money has been taken out off my account but not record of where product is.Not very happy about this with this being my first time buying off of amazon. Not planning on buying anything in the future.
3,Is this actually the 3D version?,Is this actually the 3D version of the movie? or do they just show you the regular version?
3,wow... :O(,I didn't buy this version yet but had to post. I'm extremely ticked off aparrently there are no special features and the movie will have an ultimate version in NOVEMBER!!!!!! Then a 3rd for the 3d version??? That's disgusting. I don't know if that is true but I'm reading reviews saying this is the case. I was on amazon looking for a cool huge special edition and couldn't find it so I guess this is why. I am so disappointed. And yea revolt and not buy it but this movie is awesome I can't wait!!!!!!! So i'm caving in and will buy this version and have to wait till a 3d version comes out. That's horrible. And a slap in the face to fans.
2,Dances with wolves on a future moon,"Just watched the blu-ray version. Too bad it wasn't available on HD-DVD. It played smoothly on my Panasonic blu-ray player, but the regular DVD looked almost as good on my Toshiba HD-DVD player. It is a shame that inferior technology, bought by Sony buying out the studios, is what we are stuck with. Visually the movie is very nice as the CGI was well done. The plot and the alien evolutionary assumptions were very weak. Five fingers and finger nails, give me a break!!! Don't think too much while you are watching this movie and you may enjoy it. The plot line follows the Gaia ideology mixed in with Dances with Wolves. It is a watch it once movie and forget it."
2,Dances With Blues Meets Nice Aliens,"Saw this movie for the first time on DVD and was surprised how derivative it was. Story was comparable to ""Dances with Wolves"" - in outer space instead of ""Old West."" C'mon, natives who don't speak English, ride around on horse-like creatures, use bow and arrows for weapons and take to a man who betrays his comrades for good.Blue creatures just happened to have two eyes, two hands and two feet. Puh-leeze, gimme something new. Spielberg already gave us realistic aliens without tails.It was visually dazzling, but only because of special effects, not cinematography.Final battle was ""Apocalypse Now"" on Pandora.James Cameron shoulda sunk this project -- like the Titanic!"
5,Great release! Make sure you update your firmware,"Just watched the extended collector's edition on my Samsung BD-C6500. Worked fine, one tiny little oddity: at three points during the film, the pause menu graphic popped up on its own (scene label, timeline, etc) and the movie kept playing. Menu went away after a couple of seconds. This behavior happened consistently at the same places (I tested it after finishing the movie). Took a moment to upgrade the player's software, problem vanished.As far as the collection itself-WONDERFUL, for all the reasons many of the other reviewers have noted. I was one of the people who passed on the original blu-ray release, because I had read this one was in the works. Well worth the wait."
2,Dances with aliens?,"I cannot belive how much hype this movie received when its core has been done so many times before and better. They stole almost the entire plot from Dances With Wolves and then set it in space, added amazing special effects and expected us to eat it up. Looks like more everyone did based on the boxoffice. But then again, most of us are like sheep heading to the slaughter. Great entertainment, with a very heavy dose of liberal morality."
5,Love this movie,Saw it in 3d at the theater and then again at IMAX. Was thrilled to see the price come down on the new release. If you have a 3D TV and BluRay this is a must have for your collection.
3,Finally in a proper retail package,"3 stars for not including the extended version of Avatar. 5 stars for the story of movie. Back then, some Blu-Ray 3D player manufacturers had exclusive rights to prevent few of 3D blockbusters from the distribution as retail B-3D disc packages. It was really stupid idea. Ebay and Amazon did sell them as ""OEM"" discs, without player, at ridiculously prices. Now, this time with the proper package and the proper price."
4,"""The Last Samuri"" with alients","Plot-wise, this movie is basically _The Last Samuri_ (or _Dances with Wolves_) with blue aliens and a dose of Deep Ecology. Surely not an original plot in any way but it's a plot that works (which it why it gets constantly re-hashed). The moralizing in the film wasn't ecaxtly subtle.Visually, the movie was amazing. After seeing it on the big-screen, however, I think watching it on DVD would be a disappointment. If you missed your chance to see this in the theater, that's too bad; it was a treat. I guess a DVD is better than nothing.Recommended."
2,Good movie not awsome,"Hello there , i went to see this movie in 3'D the effects were greate but the movie i dint like it to much.I will tell u my resons, im a hudge fan of fantasy movies but the movies with allot of futuristic technologi I dont like them to much. the battle was like borring, it was like star wars and I hate star wars. the movie was slow, and parts verry borring. The only thing I like the most of the movie is the forest in night time.avatar fans dont get angry with me, if u like the movie i respect that im just saying what i think. I went to see alice in wonderland in 3'd the efects wernt like the avatar 3'd effects of curse but the drama of alice in wonderland, action,actors.color,director,fantasy,imagination,epic battle WITH THE DRAGON WHERE BETTER THAN AVATAR. INCLUDING aLICE WASNT FUTURISTIC AND THATS WHY I LOVE THAT MOVIE JUST LIKE THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, ITS AWSOME IM THE NUMBER 1 FAN OF NARNIA AND ALICE!! SORRY AVATAR I DONT LIKE U."
1,defective,"i purchased the first theater release dvd and was motivated to buy the 3 disc set- specificaly for the extended scenes and documentary disc...but the first purchase, the disc(#1)played the first two times,after that i wasn't able to choose between the theater release and the extended version it would go straight to the main menu or the start of the theater release.So i returned it for an exchange,which amazon did so with no complaint,except the second set does the same thing. I've tried it in another dvd player and my computor-same thing. I wonder if anyone else has had the same problemcause i'm heavily disappointed considering this was for my kids"
4,What a bunch of bloody crybabies!!,"This deserves high marks, unlike a lot of the crybabies here (it's gonna be released 10 more times, milk my wallet dry, etc.)I really liked the packaging, the pullout trays that hold the discs can be a little awkward to pull out-but nothing you can't handle. The book like format of the holder and the chipboard slipcase are absolutely 1st class. I'm glad I didn't buy the 1st release of Avatar, this movie really blew me away-btw-I never saw it at a theater. So all you crybabies out there-YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT-no one's twisting your arm."
1,Great special effects.... That's about it,"I saw this twice just to make sure.. And I have to say that the visual effects are amazing. But everything else is utterly stupid. Why, because of the fact that the first time I saw it,I nearly fell asleep and the second time got really bored fast (and for the record I watch movies from the 40's to know and they can be slow, but this was extremely slow except for the end). SO if you want to watch a movie for the special effects and storyline, than you came to see the wrong movie. Instead go see Lord of the Rings.In about 5-10 years people will look back at this movie and agree with me that this movie is dumbStory:F+Acting:DDirection:BVisuals:A-Action:C"
3,Still no digital copy?,I bought Avatar when it first came but was disappointed as it did not include a digital copy for my iPhone/iPad. I was looking forward to this new release but stll do not see the digital version here. Did I miss something?Not going to buy if no digital copy is Included. Great movie but I still need the digital version.
1,"Great movie,GREAT problems w/Blu-ray players","Problems with playback,I thought it was my player,it has the latest updates.I have many reviews,and many people are having the same issues,with various players.Too bad!It looks like they were in a hurry to release this.I own many titles,and this is the only one with issues.Most dreadful:the time-line keeps popping-up during the movie,and the further you go,the more frequent the pop-up."
1,Does NOT play on my SONY BRD palyer even after update firmware x.x.021,"I love the Avatar move, so i pre-oderderd it, but when i try to play with my SONY Blue ray player it did not play, even after i updated the softwate to updat to date x.x.021 which is what lattest avilabe in sony support site,I make this Disk maker problem, why do they need to sell a disk which does not play in update date ver.I'm going to return back.as some one said in other review, make sure to try with Rent/friend copy then own for your self"
5,Awesome experience,"It was so nice to get this movie plus a ""regular"" version of it at a decent price, and it arrived quickly and in the condition promised!"
1,Not Worth It,"When this came out around Christmas of 09' it was a choice for me, either Avatar in 3D or Shrelock Holmes. Unfortunately for me and my people we wanted to try something new and decided let's see Avatar in 3D. Man, I wish somebody would have told me. The movie looks nice but it was not worth the 12 dollars spent on it. I waited about the first 1hr and a half to see some action but NOPE. This movie gave me a terrible headace the story is very familar and the main actor is very dull. Don't believe the hype behind this how this movie made it past The Dark Knight is a mystery to me because it is just terrible."
1,Blu Ray Doesn't Work. Amazon Doesn't take back.,"The blu ray disk did not play at all on my Samsung player, even after 2 firmware updates. It's played ever other blu disk I've thrown at it.Amazon is not allowing me to return it for a refund.What a rip off.Stay away from Blu Ray! Amazon should update their return policies.Blu ray disks that only play on some players should LISTED WITH WHICH PLAYERS THEY SUPPORT."
3,Old storyline retold refreshingly.,I won't spoil this for those that have yet to watch. It's really an old storyline which we've seen in so many movies in the past. Get it if you want a feel good movie.
3,Colorful but not that good,"I found Avatar to be colorful and fun to watch for that. The plot has been done before in different ways. I agree that the Goddess/Lady/Mother doesn't take sides--we are all her children--but after stating that, the film then has the Lady take sides. I realize that in movies you have to have a good verses evil situation--especially in an action film but still. I am glad that I bought it. I don't see where extra minutes would do anything to improve the film and am not about to buy new technology just so I can watch TV. As far as 3D goes, maybe if you have normal eyesight that is a good thing but if you don't it isn't. I will undoubtedly watch it for the colorfulness of it all but still I can only give it a three for the plot."
1,Offensive,"I honestly don't know how anyone over the age of twelve can like this movie, besides the effects. I can't handle psychadelics anymore, so why would i care about visual effects. One review said something about people not liking it because they lean to the right. Come on man. Even if i wanted to cut down every tree and wipe out every indigenous tribe that ever walked the planet i wouldn't dislike the movie because it preached against me. Tarkovsky could have done more with one long shot in a bathroom stall, a single hanging light bulb and a piece of duct tape, loosely based on a Fellini movie based on midgets. The teenagers that were also viewing the film described it best when they were looking for little wayne and brittany spears the entire movie."
3,inconsistant,"story was OK.When I watch scifi I can suspend belief, but there has to be some kind of consistancy in the fictional universe.A planet with all the species 6 limbed, except the humanoids? And that is just one of many.if you have not seen this, wait for it on TV."
2,"No complains, i'll just wait for future version!","I understand people's frustration and i don't blamed them. I personally was looking forward on buying this Blu-ray version of Avatar, but when i saw it was a combo i changed my mind. They will release a DVD version, so why not sell a Blu-ray version with all the features even if we have to pay $5 more or a Blu-ray 3D version for $10 more. I'll just wait for a future special edition release."
3,Pretty but lacking anything else.,"I had zero hopes that this movie would be worth seeing since it had been hyped so much and in that regard I wasn't let down since the movie was in fact pretty bad.The special effects were amazing. Visually it was a beautiful film. I especially loved the glowing lichen in the forest.Other than that the movie was boring, predictable and lame. The story line was unoriginal and uninspired. Most of the acting was horribly sub-par and the dialog was just terrible.I guess if all you want is some eye-candy then this is the movie for you - but if you are looking for a deeper story or character development or any kind of originality in anything but the visuals - I say don't watch this."
2,Drags badly till the last half hour,"Its not that Avatar is a bad movie as such, it just takes sooooooo loooooonnnnnggggg to get anywhere. I have watched it several times, but have never felt that its a great movie. There is too much fluff in the movie before it gets to the final fight. Over-hyped and over-rated."
3,Really? The theatrical version?,"I saw the Theatrical 3D version in theaters, I saw the Theatrical Version on DVD, I saw the Extended Edition on Blu Ray, and I saw the Theatrical Version on Blu Ray 3D. The only thing missing? There is no Extended Edition in 3D. WHY?!I know that they shot the entire movie using 3D cameras. So, did they use regular old tape recorders for the extended footage? They should have had the Extended Edition with the 3D edition from the start. Sure, they could have had just a regular old 3D version without the extras like they have here, but they should have had the Extended Edition with it too.5 stars for Quality of 3D, 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for stupidity. I do not know how this mathematically averages, but I'm giving it 2 stars.Edit: Ok, 3 stars"
5,"Avatar 3D Is Stunning, Superb!","Walked to see this at the local cinema on opening night in a snowstorm in NYC's UWS. Avatar at the theater was in 2D. There was hardly a 3D scene. Should have asked for a refund. But 3D movies without 3D was the norm then a few years ago. And still is in many cases like Dredd 3D. An awful movie with the lure of 3D that did not exist in the theater's viewing room.Brother, this 3D version from Amazon rocks. The 3D is magnificent, stunning, breathtaking, awesome and any other compliment you can conjure up.This movie is eye candy. That is why I bought Avatar in 3D. WYSIWYG. And I got the best 3D experience ever. This ain't no Einsteinian flick but it is entertainment.This DVD is a strong case for never going to the cinema for 3D.Buy it. You have never Avatared like this."
2,OK Movie for a rainy day,"The visuals were good but the story really was uninteresting and the dialogue so bad as to be comical. ""Jarhead clan"" for marines. The basic story is the original capitalists-vs.-trees ""I saved you because you have a strong heart,"" is the introduction to the romance angle. Aborigines trying to shoot down aircraft with arrows. Really exciting stuff. After an hour of predictability I decided it was a waste of time."
1,Greedy greedy greedy,"Highest Grossing Film of All Time, and they can't slip not one extra in the DVD? Its an insult, don't waste your money."
1,No special features. No digital copy. This sucks!,"Are you kidding me? It's 2010 with Blu-ray technology and we get the movie only with a ""bonus"" DVD version? This doesn't even come with a digital copy-even Disney does that. And movie companies wonder why people aren't buying movies.This is a great movie, but will teach me to read the packaging prior to purchase.Just rent it and wait for a better DVD addition."
1,dont be a sucker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i wont be buying this movie no time soon.no special features? give me a break! buying dvd's is an expensivehobby for me. i want all the bells and whistles when i make a purchase.
1,Movie Continued on Disc 2?,"What genius at 20th Century Fox thought it was a good idea to have the first half of each version of the movie on disc 1 and continue the movie on disc 2? It would have been nice to watch any of the newer versions WITHOUT having to insert another disc. Very poor planning on the part of someone at 20th Century Fox! oh, wait! A future box set will be released with each version on a separate disc. Maybe it wasn't poor planning on the part of the studio. I've already sold this version and hopefully someone will get it right the next time! Shame on you 20th Century Fox"
1,20th Century Fox milking fans for all they're worth.,"Just like the 2 million different versions of Star Wars and LOTR DVDs, James Cameron is going to milk fans with a release with NO extras, only to release a special edition later in the year. Save your money and wait for the special edition to come out in November 2010."
5,Fabulous story,It is amazing how realistic the movie is. The blend of animation and reality is seamless. Astonishing that the intelligence and creativity exists to make it.
3,Not as expected,I thought it would came with 3 different discs but it came with blu-ray 3D and regular version on the same disc and a dvd disc
5,Great Pleasure,"I would recommend this movie to all, There is so much happening that its hard to stay focus on one item. Story is magnificent with a lot of talent to go with it. Something very different to the every day show and any age would show delight in watching, with unusual figures of the past, Figures of the very near future, Special effects are fantastic with the colors meeting and mixing with one another. Movie is a must see, one you can watch several times and still enjoy. So what are you waiting for, grab your goodies sit and relax, so put your feet up while watching the marvelous entertainment before your eyes, you wont be sorry."
5,For all the senses,"This is one of the most visually stunning movies that was made for Blue-Ray. The sound and the imagery are intense from the first few moments of the story. The story is that for the ages. At a time when man is looking at his affects on the environment, this movie takes an outside in look. The war in the movie can easily be a war within oneself. How much is too much? Where is the connecting point? I enjoyed watching the warrior connect to his inner self for the first time. He went through a true transformation. Great movie, great visuals, great sound, great story..."
3,It's Not Easy Being Blue,"I liked Avatar, I thought it was an ok movie, I thought Sam Worthington was terribly miscast though (sorry I just don't classify him as a very good actor) although the film did excite me in the battle scenes, I found them terrific.I still call Aliens Cameron's best movie and have not seen anything even close that tops that all out action gem.Avatar was not what I thought it was going to be but then maybe I had my hopes raised too high with all the pre-release ballyhoo.This might just as well have been a Disney Film, you almost expect to hear When You Wish Upon A Star play in the background at any moment."
1,"Cliche, cliche, cliche","Literally 2 hours and 42 minutes of one tired cliche after another. In fact, the entire plot is a cliche. And don't get me started on the antagonists...Here's a perfect example of the idiocy this film has to offer:Jake Sully (the main character):""Ha, ha! Yeah, come on! What you got! Oh yeah, who's bad? That's right. Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, b---! That's right, get your punk a-- back to mommy! Yeah? Yeah, you got nothin'! You keep runnin'! Why don't you bring some of your friends, huh?""[Turns around and sees an angry Thanator standing in front of him]I wish I was making this up; I wish I was lying about how awful this script is - but I'm not. If you liked this movie, I feel very sorry for you."
4,The Best Modern Sy-Fy ever! Would give 5 stars if extras were included!,Unbelievable lack of extra features fom a movie that begs for it! An obvious attempt for another release tomake more money!
2,"Great effects, predictable story","Cameron did a great job of portraying his vision of an alien world, but the story quickly becomes predictable in a particularly unsatisfying way. I won't spoil the ending here, but I should note that the movie seems intended as a vehicle for heaping scorn on capitalism and the military."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,I only wish I could project it ontoan IMAX in my livingroom! I feltlike I was there with them.
5,"Not usually a sci-fi/outer space movie lover, but. .",The cinematography was amazing and I loved the story too. The creatures were made to look so real - quite advanced from what you saw in Jurassic park.
5,Awesome,"What a great movie. We watched it in 3-D and were blown away. Well worth the money. My only complaint is the packaging, be careful when you try to remove the shrink wrap from the package. I accidently cut into the plastic protective sleeve."
4,GREAT movie,"For me, the Blu-ray loses something compared to the IMAX 3-D; but it's still an epic story and a stunning visual presentation."
5,avatar,"this is the best movie i have seen in 3D, i love the director and the characters, so you should go watch it in 3D"
5,Very entertaining,I really like this movie. It's very interesting and keeps your attention. The story is great and the grapics are wonderful.
3,"Wait for the whole package, this is bull!",One day they will put out a 3D version w/extended Blu-ray scenes and special features about the making of the movie. That's when I'll buy it. This multiple edition crap only goes to show the greed involved with this movie. No respect at all for the fans! Five stars for movie itself and 3 for this edition.
5,brilliant,"This is an amazing film. the picture and sound quality are excellent,I would recommend anyone with a 3d tv to see this"
3,it's alright.,"i didn't really care for this movie but i bought it for my son, since we bought a 3-D tv. and my opinion is that journey to the center of the earth is a better 3-D movie than Avatar. plus it's a sci-fi dances with wolves movie."
1,"Movie is fantastic in 3D, but this version that was purchased was NOT the full version as advertised.","Not as advertised, as the main 2 pictures of the Blu-Ray showed the full version 3D movie, not a promotional Blu-Ray without all the additional features."
4,Blueray is great!,All I can say is that the quality of video with the Blu-ray is amazing. I popped in the DVD and it looked like I was watching youtube. Definitely need the Blu-ray for a movie like this.
5,Very entertaining movie,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Not so much for a fantastic storyline, acting, but for the visual effect. Reminded me of Jurassic Park when it first came out. Kind of OK storyline and acting, but the visuals were mind blowing, which makes for a great movie experience. Avatar is the Jurassic Park of the new decade."
2,AVATAR,"Fantastic movie w/a message in the story line. This is a movie that we bought so that we could watch it repeatedly. If you enjoy fantasy, or just enjoy a political message about saving our planet, you might want to have this video in your library."
4,One of the best movies of the year,"Beautiful Blu-ray DVD set. Solid movie, but not worthy of 5 stars. I enjoy the extended cut more than the theatrical release."
5,Love the movie,Love the movie but think its stupid to continuously keep re-releasing the movie to make even more money. Dont they think the movie has made enough money already. Anyway I only re-bought the movie because I just recently got into blu ray just before this release and gave my dvd copy to someone as a gift.
3,No Digital Copy...Disappointing,"The movie/discs are fine with the exception of no digital copy. Seriously, given the technology today and higher price of the Blu-Ray discs you would think they could give you the digital copy the way many other studio's will. I guess the first reviewer was right, should not have purchased this disc.Greed has superseded ""the right thing"". Sad."
3,TECHNICAL ALERT!,"If you have an ""older"" DVD player, it MAY NOT PLAY these discs. I have a circa-2006 Toshiba DVD player, and only disc 3 will play in my machine. Disc 2 will play in my Mac (only), and Disc 1 won't work at all.I wrote Toshiba about this; their reply: ""... it is possible that the discs that won't play are not formatted properly for this Toshiba unit. This could be due to the way in which the manufacturer distributes the product or it could be that the format used to create a 'burnt' disc is not compatible with this unit.""Having similar problems with the Star Wars original Trilogy set. Next, stop -- an angry email to 20th Century Fox.ADDENDUM: Talked to Netflix today, as I had a similar problem with one of its movies. Netflix CONFIRMED that the new DVD coding is causing problems for its subscribers. No reply yet from Fox."
4,WARNING!!! NOT extended collector's edition here,"I am very disappointed not to find extended collector's edition in this version, so you will find only the original film version and nothing else, no EXTRAS, nothing more, same as it came out in the panasonic version, plus the DVD of the same ... so long ...... waiting for this?!..buff!"
1,not worth the hype,"This movie is horrible, boring, and completely predictable. For all the money they spent on the graphics, you would think they would have spent more on the screenplay. Don't waste your time on this complete failure of a movie."
1,Normal Hollywood Trash,"I watched this movie last night. Fortunately I didn't have to pay to go to the movie theater to see it. A family member owns this movie. The one star is for the mixture of good computer imagery (good computer programmer). To say the best, the story line is boring and the usual hollywood political idoacy. The plot seems created by the same guy who writes most of hollywood's trash today and pre-school political childs books. I guarantee that a new copy of this movie will be available for less than $5 at your local Target in less than a year. If you really want to see it wait until your family member buys it then, and don't waist your money."
1,Change Disks to See 2nd Half of Movie??!!,"Avatar is my all-time favorite movie. I've been waiting for this release for a long time so that I could see the extra footage. But changing disks in the middle of an action movie is just guaranteed to ruin the flow of the experience. All they had to do was invest in a fourth disk and each version could have stood alone on it's own disk. Do they really have to economize this way?I was about to buy this set, but instead I've just purchased the single disk original theatrical release. Good enough until the ""ultimate special edition"" comes out with individual disks for the different versions of the movie."
1,Why buy this? It's STILL NOT in 3D!,"Don't ever buy a first edition James Cameron disc release...ever. Because if you wait just a little longer, something like this gets released. But guess what...it's STILL not in 3D. So there's at least two more releases down the road...the theatrical release (NOW IN 3D!!!!)...and another director's cut (NOW IN 3D!!!!)...the Cameron marketing machine is targeting the suckers, don't fall for it."
1,No Thanks,"- The Red Letter Media ""Avatar"" review is spot-on. This is the third attempt by Hollywood at 3-D and it's pretty cool, but so what. The story is the most important thing and ""Avatar"" has a ""been there, done that"" feel that rehashes everything from ""Dances with Wolves"" to Cameron's own ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss."" I don't think ""Avatar"" holds up very well..."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,MY GOD THIS MOVIE WAS SO OVERRATED. I WALKED OUT AFTER AN HOUR I COULNDT TAKE. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT IT WAS THE EXCELLENT 3-D. THE STORY WAS A SNOOZEFEST.
5,The visual effects are unbelievable,Forget about the cliche predictable story line you've seen over and over. The visual effects on this movie are INSANE. Amazing. Nothing you are looking at is real and I think people forget that after a while. Everything in front of you is CG and that is so cool. The world that was built in front of your eyes is so stunning and beautiful to look at. Forgive any story issues and breath in the artist visual genius of this film!Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set
5,Avatar is an Epic Fully Developed Super Nova,"Great dvd features. Great Movie!!It's amazing how Cameron includes, social, political, military, environmental and visual effects that are the best so far!"
3,3D Depth doesn't work even selected the 3D option,"It shows the 3D option but, doesn't show any depth even after selecting 3D option. Does it really support 3D"
3,More to come,Agree I will wait for the special director's cut to get all the special content. This was 25.00 over the last few days and now it's showing 24.99. My guess that is a move to get you to pay shipping charges since 25.00 is the min for free shipping unless you have prime.
1,avatar,bad movie; skipped and was disappointed for the price even. LOVE the movie; hated the problem that came with it. AH
1,My wish,"Don't want to talk about the film.We all know that the film is a masterpiece. Why again mention that?The only thing I wanna talk about this item is, 'why don't they just sell the 3D version and lower the price'?I won't pay 19 $ for re-buying DVD and Bluray 2D that I gave to my friend long time ago to re-buy the extended version Bluray set.Done.PS: It's not 19.99$. If it goes down- I don't think so- to bellow 18$, Then I will consider buying it."
5,Excellent movie!!!,One word to describe this movie: masterpiece!!but I have to add more words to make this review possible so again this movie is a masterpiece and if you can see it in 3d even better.
5,Avatar BD,"This was my first Blu-ray disc (already had the DVD). Unbelievable difference between the two formats. However, I am only going to spend the extra dollars on movies that are special to me, not every one of them."
2,All looks and no plot,"Ok, I gave this movie a 2/5 simply because whilst the graphics were amazing 5/5, the plot was a -1/5. You know that you are in trouble when the pornographic parody of your movie has more of a plot than the actual movie does. Also, he stole a TON of star wars sounds and Halo vehicles.SpoilerHe turns into his avatar. That is it, that is the entire movie."
4,Recognition undeserved.,"Let's not inflate James Cameron's already over-inflated gargantuan ego by labeling this movie as a film that transcends space-time or whatnot. While this movie is great in its effects this is more due to the great animators at WETA than James Cameron being the credit-monger that he is. If you want great effects to try out on your HDTV buy the Blu-ray and you won't be disappointed. But if you're here to purchase a meaningful movie with innovative story-telling, this is nothing more than a multimillion dollar sci-fi Disney princess plot."
1,Horrible,"Some of the worst writing in human history went into this movie. If you want to see every character act like a complete idiot to push a badly thought out plot along, get this movie!Special effects were, of course, extraordinary. If only they had hired a writer instead of the closet full of monkeys..."
5,Avatar is Glorious,"See the IMAX 3D version. In addition to the sheer genius of the way this movie is put together and the selection of the actors (Sadana and Worthington, especially, are charming and totally believable), there are story lines involving politics that unflinchingly criticize the exploitation of other cultures (yes, the colonel is over the top: so what--the evil perpetrated by exploiters deserves the harsh depiction), and others that expore religion, psychology, myth, archetypes, and more. I took my son for his birthday--he has not stopped talking about Avatar, so now I've ordered the movie poster and pre-ordered the movie for him. Cameron's film touched both of us and will be permanently among our favorites. Thank you, James Cameron for giving my son such a memorable birthday experience."
5,Best 3D movie ever,"probably the most awsome 3D movie ever. Had to try my LG 3D tv out. Works just fine, would recomend it to anyone"
4,Excellent movie with other worldly effects,"I watched this movie a few weeks ago and somehow it completely skipped my mind to add a review at the time. Basically, it is Dances With Wolves in space. I noted this after watching and was not surprised to find out afterwards (searching Google) that others had made the same observation. Still, the effects were awesome. I would give it five-stars except for the obvious Dances With Wolves comparison -- or ripoff -- depending on how far you want to take it. I watched all three versions... the longest extended version is obviously the one to watch. I can see re-watching this movie once a year or two years. Good to have something help fill the Farscape void. Which reminds me... Bring Back Farscape!!!"
3,EXTENDED IS BETTER. STILL DERIVATIVE,"Widely derided as derivative in numerous ways and from many sources (Poul Anderson anyone?), never-the-less James Cameron's film (he wrote, produced and directed) struck a nerve with a wide audience who made this big screen 3-D adventure an entertainment event. Brilliant marketing was in sync with everything from concerns of environmental activists to liberal political wonks. Some even saw it as a kind of spiritual meditation or mandala. The theatrical release broke every movie for initial gross receipts with over $3 billion in revenue (not counting the multiple DVD and Blu-ray editions). But more than anything, this film is mostly a technological and engineering achievement. The hi-def 3-D ""Extended Edition"" looks great and adds a back-story with nuanced moments here and there that enhance the viewing experience. The ""Extended Collector's Edition"" includes three versions of the movie and hours of generous extras plus 3-D for the home advanced theater."
4,Exciting movie,"I simply love the movie, Avatar. The imagination, the sweep of visual ""eye candy"" and even the story, which is an old one, but wonderfully presented in this movie. The only reason I don't give it a five star rating is because I also saw it in 3-D in a theatre, which was absolutely stunning. Still, I find myself running Avatar again and again, simply because it captures my imagination.If you want your imagination fired up and enjoy fantastic NEW vistas and visions, you should like Avatar."
4,Lovely,"It is the year 2154, and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) arrives on the planet Pandora, which is home to a rare mineral needed back on earth. Scientists there have created ""avatars"" which are a cross between humans and the indigenous blue Na'vi people; Sully is asked to use his avatar to befriend the locals and get them to leave the area so mining can expand.The movie blends live actors and computer-generated scenes and its story reminded me a lot ofFernGully: The Last Rainforest; both have innocent Mother Earth-loving natives pitted against evil, nature-hating industrialists, lush forests with a pleasing color palette of greens, pinks, and purples, and even a sacred tree. This movie is lovely to look at and the 3-D effects are fun, even if much of it does seem like a fancy comic book. The actors are all fine, the animation is well-done, and the script is predictable but exciting. Recommended for fans of animation, action, and adventure."
3,DVD Quality,"I understand that it is a piece of plastic but a DVD, at this price, should be processed without flaws. I saw it at the movies and wanted a copy when they finally came out. Went past 3/4 of the DVD, when it started to act up. It stopped and jumped 4 times. Maybe this is the only bad copy.Good luck to others."
5,Thank you James Cameron !,"Thank you James Cameron for bringing us avatar ,it is by far the single Greatest movie experience i have ever had ,and i have seen lots of the greats .i regret that you did not win at the academy awards for best film and best director ,i mean yeah ok hurt locker was kinda a cool movie ,but to be voted over avatar? c'mon ,that was a crime ,a real pity ,unbelievable injustice .God Bless you and i hope you continue to rule over all other film makers ,who you tower over ,head and shoulders .please keep bringing us groundbreaking movies that astound and entertain us ."
2,Blue stoners!,"Looks Awesome. Sure it was expensive to make. It is the worst movie out of Matrix,Star Wars and Lord of the rings.And they are just ""trees"". The blue freaks are totally on acid!"
1,big question????????,"do i understand this right? the second disc is a continuation of the first? in other words, only half the movie is on the first disc and then you have to go to disc 2 to finish it? can someone explain??"
1,Sci-fi Film or Anti-War Film,"I saw this movie at my local theater and at first I enjoyed it but later on in the film I was not pleased with what I saw for a number of reasons.First of all as a Sci-fi film it should have a lot of action scenes. This movie had only one battle scene at the end that lasted for about 10 to 20 minutes.Secondly the film portrayed the marines as stupid, heartless, family killers.The main character was a traitor to the marines.It dragged on and on and was boring and redundant.The natives to the planet had a religion that closely resembled the Force.The movie was a big promotor of environmentalism.The movie resembled the Vietnamn war.I did not like this film. Do not go to the Theater and do not by the DVD, but atmost rent it."
5,Amazing,"We went and saw Avatar twice at the theater. Visually, it is breathtaking. I couldn't look away, it's seductive beauty. I bought the Bluray when it was released and did indeed love it in 2D. I was afraid to watch it at first and be let down, but that was not the case! Fortunately, I was upgrading both of our living rooms to 3D and I bought 2 Panasonic 3D Bluray players. I got 2 free Avatar 3D with them!! And I'll never watch my 2D edition of Avatar again...... :oD"
2,like watching an aquarium,"I liked Cameron's Titanic and also Aliens. Seeing Avatar is like watching an aquarium for 3 hours: pretty colors and lots of motion. The plotline is very predictable, the characters are one-dimensional. With all that invested in this - the special effects are the star - you think Cameron would have added something interesting from a plot perspective. I was actually fighting off sleep watching this in the theater."
1,Did Cameron cut down the Tree of Souls for those useless paper covers?,"Just in time for Earth Day comes the biggest movie every... mauling entire forests to make paper sleeves to cover the plastic cover with the same exact image.Cameron is a control freak about every detail of his movie, too bad that doesn't extend to how it is released. I'm pretty sure the man who helmed the 2 highest-grossing movies ever has enough pull, just a matter of how much he cares to. Somewhere in a the Nav'i world, a large white willow tree is being torn down."
4,Received quickly & in perfect condition.,"I received the DVD quickly. It was in perfect condition. It is excellent quality. But, it isn't my favorite movie to watch in 3D. Animation doesn't quite capture the 3D effects as well as regular film."
2,Disappointing,"The first half of the movie is promising, but the second half fades into a fairly ordinary action film. Many of the reviewers seemed so impressed with the technical elements of the movie that they were willing to overlook this weakness in the development of the story, but I felt even more disappointed that the filmmakers lost control of promising material. Except for its technical aspects, a truly ordinary movie."
1,"Great Movie, but...","This is a the rip-off edition of the Blu-ray. It has absolutely no special features, and is missing the additional footage being added to the film.Wait for the Special Edition, set to come out later this year. If you've got a craving for this awesome movie, either rent it or just go watch in 3D at your local theater. You won't regret watching it; you will regret buying this disc though."
1,A short review,"Great special effects. Terrible overused plot.The big bad evil military vs. the nature-loving indigenous peoples. Sound familiar?I went into the movie with an open mind, and honestly I love James Cameron. But I found the story to be too recycled."
5,Awesome~!,"I LOVE this movie, and I LOVE the edition I got. The collectors edition is SO much better than the original and the product was bran new! I am impressed with this product and THANK YOU!"
1,"No extras, no sale.","Nice price point, but no extras and no extended release. These features are out there. Why wouldn't they be included with this highly anticipated release? They'll be included in the next one that will tempt people to buy again. I've waited this long, I think I'll wait a little longer."
1,READ CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING,"Why on earth would they split the three versions across two discs? For me it ruin the viewing pleasure having to get up swap discs. The story differences aren't that spectacular, the opening scenes showing an over crowded earth and explaining Jake's brother funeral. Some of the scenes on the planet actually ruin the continuity of the battle scene.I didn't want to give it any stars"
3,not on one disc sucks a little,"i have no clue whose idea it was to put the two movies on two different disc that sucks half way thru the movie you have to put in disc 2 to finish which ever version you are watching. why they could not put the original and the re release on there own cd seen stupid it ruins the action of the movie, if i had known thats what these dvds where i would not have bought themso fair warning you play dvd 1 for which ever version you want half way thru you have stop it and put in dvd 2 and finish which ever version you are watchingi will be looking just for the rerelease version on its own dvd if they release it that way some where"
5,I would give it 10 Stars if I could!,"I purchased Avatar on Blu-Ray on it's release date, went home and watched it. I was very impressed. Then I bought a new 240HZ LED TV and OMG this movie is AMAZING!!! It is by far the movie to show exactly what a Blu-Ray movie should be! I really like the story, acting, oh and did I mention WOW the detail is off the charts!! This movie actually looked 3D!! My recommendation, go buy it, you won't be sorry!"
3,Avatar,"The ""special"" Avatar package contains two disc's. Not a good deal. One is Blue Ray and one is standard DVD. I thought I was getting a ""features"" disc, which would show some of the production that went into making the movie. Nope, just got two movies. Not a good deal. The movie was OK, if you like the ""evil white man, trampling on the poor natives"" concept. Didn't think much of the story line, just standard crap coming out of hollywood these days."
4,Great Price,Awesome Movie and Great Price. I do not like the DVD Cover/Packaging. It is not easy to get the case out and looks like it could just tear in half or something. The DVD extras are pretty cool and exactly what I was waiting for. Recommended!
2,"Good movie, but...","The movie in Blu Ray is great. Better picture quality then the movies 3D version.BUT - No digital copy? Absolutly no extras?! This could have been done much, much better."
1,Unplayable Disc - Just Plain Sick,"Unplayable disc. I'm returning it and FOX will need to get their act together before they can add my hard earned dollars to their financial statements. Producing an unplayable disc is just plain sick.The Avatar motion picture is great. I've paid for and seen it in 3D and standard theaters. I've paid for the Blu Ray Disc and with a very new and capable Blu Ray Player I cannot play it.FOX has produced a product (Avatar DVDs and Blu Ray discs) that many of its customers cannot use. This represents gross managerial negligence regarding their customer relations and it will no doubt affect their bottom line. Hopefully they and other corporations will discontinue their abuse of loyal customers and prioritize their needs over the vague and unquantifiable consequences of ""piracy"". All we want to do is pay for a solid product. FOX: you have failed to deliver."
3,Avatar BluRay - No Digital Copy - Boo,Ok...Movie is good.BluRay is stunning.Disappointed that there is no included Digital Version for iTunes
2,"Good movie, Disappointing DVD","I loved Avatar, so I went out and pre-ordered the DVD as soon as I could.As soon as the package arrived, I ripped open the box and put it in my DVD player, eager to watch all the special features and directors' commentary and all the other goodies that I was sure James Cameron stuffed into his masterpiece.Only to discover that there are, in fact, none of these perfectly standard features on the disc. No commentary, no features, not even trailers. This is the reason we buy DVDs now instead of renting. If I only wanted to watch the movie, I would go to Blockbuster. I shelled out extra money because I wanted something extra in return. Then they turn around and ask me to buy the special edition coming out in a few weeks. Yeah, thanks, like you've earned my trust.James Cameron and Fox spent a quarter of a billion dollars on this movie and made it all back thanks to fans like me, then gave us all the finger with this lame DVD."
4,Tech marvel,You may like the story line or not but what shines about this 3D video is the imagination of those who crafted it. Avatar is entertaining on so many levels that it is hard to miss by purchasing this one.
5,Hosehead's Review,"Avatar is a great visual movie. I had a friend of mine call it Dances with Wolves in Blue. Even though the storyline is similar, the visual effects are outstanding here."
1,Again another Rip OFF!,NO features just the movie and even the movie on blu-ray doesn't have any audio HD format.
1,Same Milked Release Strategy as LotR,"I thought the 60 different releases of Lord of the Rings was enough back in the day, now it looks like Avatar is gonna go the same route, possibly worse for the following reasons.1. It has already been announced that there's gonna be a special extended edition.2. A 3-D version has also been confirmed, probably theatrical release at first.3. Sometime after the 3-D version comes I bet there will also be a Special Extended 3-D Edition.All that being said, I bet Blu-Ray will be on its way out and a higher quality media(Purple-Ray or whatever it may be called) will be soon to make its debut and the cycle will go on."
1,Avatar blu-ray,"PLEASE DO NOT GIVE FOX YOUR MONEY... YET. Like Peter Jackson and his LOTR Trilogy, this edition is being sold because the CEOs know the geekoid masses will buy it right away. The version that the public will really want will come in November. These guys make enough money, believe me! (I'm in the industry). I wish this shameless practice would stop- and it will if we all vote with our patience as well as our dollars."
1,Overpriced Blu-ray!!!,"I loved Avatar so much that I went to see it 3 times at the theater, but I am hesitant to purchase this bare-bones Blu-ray due to the price. Usually when a movie is a huge blockbuster, the studio can afford to sell the DVD/Blu-ray for less due to the fact that they don't need to recoup the production and advertising money back. So my question is why is the price of this Blu-ray so much?! Especially considering that before Christmas you could get District 9, Inglourious Basterds, and Harry Potter all for under $18 each, with special features, and a digital copy. It seems like the studio is being way too greedy for selling this Disc for $25.00 knowing that they are going to release at least 2 more versions of this movie in the next year. I would have loved to see Fox set the new standard for Blu-ray pricing by releasing this movie for around $14.99. But instead they decided to ""low blow"" us like this? : ("
1,"Exploiting consumers, just like exploitation in the movie","BEWARE: When you buy a movie, you expect to get all the extra content like deleted scenes, behind the scenes, interviews, etc as appreciation for your purchase.NOT THIS ONE.This is a bare bones version to milk profits. Around November, another version of Avatar will be released that will include a whole lot of content. This version was released early strictly to rack up profits knowing the real edition will also sell especially around the holidays. Don't support this type of activity."
1,"""ALERT, ""it don't play""","Just got the opening day release of A[[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]. Right out of the box it would not play on my LG blu-ray player. A little reseach showed that it is a DRM problem with LG and Samsung Players. A message tells me I need a firmware update. No one at Blu-ray seems to know what to do, so I have a nice shiny Drink coaster and I can't return it because its been opened. The DVD version works just fine; the effects are fantastic, the story, you've seen it before in any number of action adventure movies."
3,Looks great; unoriginal story and soundtrack,"This movie certainly looks great. The colors and textures are vibrant and realistic, at least as far as an alien world is concerned; the sci fi hardware is authentic enough, and so on. Great job by the art dept., FX people, etc.The soundtrack sounds quite a bit like the ones for Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan and Aliens. It's probably the same composer.And how many times have we seen this story already? Whether you call it Pocahontas, The Emerald Forest, Dances with Wolves, or something else, it's the same deal: Indigenous people live in harmony with nature; rapacious invaders arrive to plunder and kill; natives fight back; someone from among the invaders goes rogue and goes native and turns against his own people once he sees the error of their ways. Yawn. Been there, seen that."
3,I couldn't wait.,"3 stars to balance my hatred for movie studio greed and one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever. I couldn't wait all the extra months for the extended edition. It's only $20. I'm not that broke. I paid more than that for 2 tickets to watch it in the theater. I wanted to see it on my new HDTV now. But yeah, I totally understand all the 1 star reviews. I can't blame anyone who decides to go the torrent route."
5,"FINALLY A RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR OCTOBER 16, 2012!!!!","Finally after two years of waiting the wide release of Avatar in 3D BLU RAY format has been scheduled for October 16th, 2012. As of this morning. The Wait for the best 3D BLU RAY yet is over."
1,STEER CLEAR,"the 1 star above is both for the film itself and the product. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! no features at all. james cameron is stretching avatar as far as it will go. a new release is comin out soon with features. also, in 2011 a special edition thing is comin out with more features. plus it is an all together bad (okay not bad) film that was extremely overrated. . . overrated. . . overrated. acting is great, special effects are great, story is mediocre, but, it is the overratedness that should turn everyone away from this product. also, teach distributors that they cant take advantage of the public by refusing to buy the next additions of avatar that come out.i wish u could put 0 or negative stars"
1,"Great Movie, Terrible Quality","I think this is a great movie but what was so special about it was its special effects which couldn't be enjoyed through Amazon Video on Demand because the quality was so poor and blurry. Don't waste your money, if you want to go to the store to rent it or just buy it!"
1,EMPTY PACKAGING,"I purchased a 3 disc dvd blu-ray combo and received ZERO discs in my order. The closed packagining was EMPTY. What a disappointment. Now I have so much work to do to get my money back. NEVER order from this verndor or AMAZON, in general."
3,Not Really Sure,"The movie is amazing!!! Could watch it 20 times a day!!!! BUT it skips alot and I don't know if it is my ""player"" or the movie. Will keep trying."
1,Science fiction version of Dances with Wolves,"Guys, I think the beginning of this movie project was like that:James Cameron invited some of crew to his house for a secret meeting.James and crew start watching `Dances with Wolves' (Kevin Costner) made in 1990 while they taking drugs (perhaps marijuana).James starts writing a NEW and ORIGINAL story for the movie which they called it `Avatar' later, while crew and of course James were high and had very colorful imagination.They start to make an Animation, but try to represent is as a MOVIE with VERY HIGH TECH SPECIAL EFFECTS.And then people watch the movie and think: WOW, what an original story. WOW, what a special effect. WOW, What a director. And ...And this is end of story: the movie gets all time highest Gross revenue worldwide. (Funny but sad)For those who want to see this movie without special effects, I recommend you guys to watch Dances with Wolves."
1,A New Way to Show Reruns,"My title said it all. When I watch this story I felt like I was watching a 1990 western illustrating how badly the Indians were treated over 100 years ago and other similar stories. This movie was so predictable that to me it was a rerun. Almost all the technical details was left out to explain why humans were still living under a military rule and the only way to solve a problem is to kill all the men involved. I did notice that when they went into battle all the women from earth seem to disappear. So, I give this movie a 1 star because of the amazing special effects. To bad a good thought provoking storyline could not been added with it. It reminds me of Star Wars that everyone seems to love too. Yet, James Cameron had to make a lot of money from this movie because it cost so much to make."
1,"Move was good, this DVD release is NOT","Avatar was a good movie. I was going to buy this blu ray until I found out it was basic. PEOPLE... come on, the only way to stop this tactic of them releasing a featureless version first and having to wait for later extended editions is to NOT BUY THE BASIC VERSION. Do NOT buy it... rate it low... whatever it takes... this practice is wrong and they clearly do it knowing that a percentage of the potential buyers and fans will not be able to wait and will end up buying multiple copies of the same movie. It is relatively unethical. Clearly they can do it, but if enough vote with their wallet (by not opening it) this type of policy will have to change."
2,Over hyped and unimpressive,After all the hype and buzz about this movie I bought the Blu-ray version. Having never seen it at the theater I expected to be blown away by the story and cgi effects. It turned out to be the same old plot line about the evil humans destroying everything in their path. The cgi although getting better still looks like cgi. I had to watch this overly long movie in two sittings to keep myself from using the fast forward button. If there is a sequel I'll avoid it.
3,Visually stunning....but little else,"There are TONS of great sf novels, complex novels searing with ideas that resonate and yet so few filmmakers are smart or brave enough to take them on. Instead we get this bubblegum story set on a breathtaking world with no real characters of interest. Quite honestly, other than the visuals, this film was boring. If I wanted to watch a Dances with Wolves type film, I would just watch Dances with Wolves, which is to me a much better film precisely because while it is still a simple story, the characters are real and engaging."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I just sat down to watch this excellent movie, and about 20 minututes into it, the picture stopped working. I stopped the movie and hit play again and a screen popped up saying that my player needs to be updated. I went to the directed site for the firmware update which is the same as I currently have loaded. So now I am stuck waiting for an update to be released in order to watch the movie. DON""T let 20th Century Fox get away with releasing products that cannot readily be played on players that ARE up to date.On a side note the 1* review is not directed towards the film, but at the company that released it and made me waste my time and money."
4,A Really Really Good Start,I really believe this guy is headed for greatness. This CD is not quite there in the sense that I don't hear a musical thumbprint (and I am not talking about a personal style) but that is getting very picky. I listen to it all the time. Bravo Vieux!
2,Not for e-therapists,"This book was already somewhat dated when it was published. It is now very out of date. The author has an engaging writing style and as a philosophical reflection on the character of cyberspace it makes interesting reading (although others have done it better). However it is NOT a professional text. I should point out that the author's only other book about e-therapy is a work of fiction, a murder mystery. Dozens of my acquaintances have purchased this book thinking that they would learn from it how to do online counseling, and they have been disappointed. The author has no particular expertise as an online therapist, and the text does not reflect current research and practice in online clinical work. Clinicians interested in the practice of e-therapy will not find what they are looking for here. There is nothing of practical use in this book that is not already available for free on the web."

2,Looks great but not very functional,I was disappointed in the quality and functionality. The case holds your Palm and a 8.5x11 legal pad but the top and bottom inside flaps flip out when closed and get bent and catch on things.I also wish it had a inner holder for loose papers.This case is not very durable and I am glad I did not pay $70 for it on Palm's site. I paid $40+ for it and it was money wasted
1,Not so good,"Had a Zen Stone, but left it in my pocket and washed it.Still worked!Did it again.Doesn't work.Decided the Coby clip sounded like a good way to prevent further washings of my MP3s (I like CLEAN music).Player feels cheap and flimsy compared to the Zen.And...broke on second usage. Play button snapped and now the player won't stay on.Having a hard time getting Coby customer service to answer questions.Guess I'll be going back to another Zen stone--just try to keep the trips through the washing machine limited to one."
2,Only positive is the clip,"I bought this player because of the clip on feature which is great. Other than that it has a cheap feel to it, it's hard to skip songs or adjust the volume while running or exercising without unclipping it and looking at it, and the buttons have a loud clicking sound to them. It says the rechargable battery will last 5 hours and it hasn't so far. The USB adapter to charge the battery and add songs is not a cable, more like a bulky flash drive and it won't fit into the front ports on my computer so I have to plug it in the back....it's a pain unless you have easy access to the back of your pc."
4,Coby MP-C582 Clip MP3 Player 1 GB - Red,"Wanted something simple for mom. Point and shoot. I download, she plays. She loves it. Compact, portable and rechargeable. No batteries to purchase. 1 GB just enough room for her kind of music."
4,"Functional, small, good value","I bought this for way less than $20. I have an IPOD, but wanted something generic looking for the subway. This Coby works fine. My laptop recognized it immediately, and I was downloading to it within 5 minutes. I have both music and audio books on it, and the sound quality is fine. The ear phones that came with it are OK, but I use Smoking Buds for a snug fit if I use it at the gym. I appreciate Amazon for finding me deals like this. Thanks."
5,An informative and beneficial text.,"As a registered nurse I would recommend this book to anyone considering diet modification. While everyone can't adhere to the strict regime, there is a great deal of sound information to take away from the text. As far as the nameless ratings nay-sayer and his negative comments go, I want to see his medical credentials. He should also take the time to learn about ALS before he makes additional absurd statements."
4,Dr. Walford didn't die of old age!!!,"Dr. Roy L. Walford is an old man. ... 120 Year Diet,'' is dying from the fatal nerve disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease.I read reviews saying he died of old age... not true.ari@changeyourlife.org"
3,So why did Dr. Walford die in his 70s?,"I read this book and was somewhat impressed. Certainly most Americans would do well to eat less and to make every calorie a nutritious one. However, like so many good ideas, I think the proponents of caloric restriction take the implementation of their concepts to extremes, as Dr. Walford may have. Dr. Walford's daughter, Lisa, who also wrote a book on CR, evidently has a BMI of 15. I don't know how tall she is but for me, at 5'4"", to have a BMI of 15, I'd have to weigh 88#! At 112#, I'm already told frequently how thin I am, don't think I'd look, feel or be healthy at 24 lbs. lighter. Also, the fact that Dr. Walford recommends the consumption of animal flesh, despite all the research showing how harmful its consumption is, gave me pause. I'd recommend you read Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. instead."
3,Good ideas but poor scholarship,"This book contains many interesting ideas but the author's poor scholarship brings it all into question. For example he gives no references for his nutritive value charts, making them useless. Most of his assertions are unreferenced, so they are useless. He states one list is ""accurate and usable"" but it gives two glycemic indexes for lentils: 30-39% and 20-29%, so you can take your pick. Walford lists the virtues of liver but fails to point out that it is extremely high in cholesterol and arachidonic acid. He says most grains have a low glycemic index - which is nonsense. Walford compares almonds by the ""teaspoon"" with cashews by ""14 large"" which is useless. Perhaps his most surprising omission is to ignore the evidence that the nutrient content of food varies enormously depending on its source. However Walford openly admits that his advice is ""not competely verified"", and much of his evidence results from work on rats. Perhaps this is why I smell a rat."
3,Great Biblical introduction for kids,My wife and I found this series at the library and have made an effort to purchase every tape. The Bible stories are accurate and funny. The animation could be upadate but my 3 year old did not complain much. It is a great way to introduce Bible characters to your children
5,html 4,This is a reference book for me to use when I get back into building websites. I am working on one now and will be linking pages together.
2,MASTERING HTML4 THE HARD WAY,"The information is all here the trouble is that you have to dig for it. The Rays, who usually write pretty good books, must have done a cut and paste job here. You never know where the practice code writing begins and the examples leave off- which is exasperating if you are using this for self-instruction."
4,quite ok,"HTML was the first language I learnt. I used this book for desining a site for my company. I think that this book proved quite benefitial in many respects. The one thing this book lacks are good(a little tough) examples. The coverage of HTML is almost complete. The masters ref section is good(only HTML ,not script and CSS). All in all this book will serve as a good reference but things are not that organised like they should be. But it is worth the money i spent."
2,GET A CLUE!!!!,"This was the first of James Rver Trilogy I read. I hope the rest is a BIG improvement. The beginning was good, but Wesley turned into a Grade-A J E R K . Come on people!!! The guy dumps poor Leah FLAT, takes off for a year or so, and comes back to run around with an old flame. On top of that, he says that she's loose and to leave him alone because it hurts his old girlfriend. All Leah ever wanted was some one to love. And then Weslye wonders why Leah won't go for him? Come on dude, where were you for the first part of the book? This book was demeaning. The heroine gets a tough-luck sob-story and, try as I might, I couldn't get up any sympathy for Wesley. I trust the other books had characters that were a little more enjoyable."
2,river lady,This book had no ending. It just stop. I have read alot of the authors books this is the worst.
1,River lady,"One of the sRiver Ladytupidest books I've ever read in my entire life. Even for a damsel in distress-no, make that damsel in constant and continual distress-the book is ridiculous. What a waste of time and money."
4,Very Good!,"Well this was my first book of hers, and it made me a fan! I really did like the characters and the plot, not to mention the romance! I would recomend this book to readers who like romance books with an actual story. The only thing I would change is to make certain parts at the end shorter, because it starts to get confusing and would ruin the whole book if it wasn't so good!"
3,Could have been better,"River Lady lacked romance and its adventure got muddled up. The begining of the book starts off great. Unfortunatly the story losess its appeal in the middle. I continued to read and told my self that it would get better, but it did not. The ending lacked the hero we normaly see in Jude Deveraux books and in my oppinion it left me hanging in the end. I am a Deveraux fan and own most of her books. This book could have been great if she had only stuck to the plot she set out in the begining. Leah gave into guickly, and Wesley still remained the same stubborn idiot he was in the begining. It left me wanting more."
1,A disaster,"This book was a complete disaster. It's poorly written and honestly none of the characters are likable.Leah had potential but she whined a lot about her family name and how her sister was a prostitute. Wesley was just an ass from the get go. Even the beginning, when Leah and Wesley meet again, is a bit repulsive (One example: Leah's hygiene is not up to par and her dress is torn and dirty. She sits with Wesley, tries to flirt and leans forward so he can smell her body odor.) I couldn't see why Leah would want someone like Wesley. He walks her home after meeting again since she was a child and they randomly have sex. After their encounter, he tosses money at her and says that he hopes [that] at least THAT part of her was clean.Like I said, he's a jerk.I gave up on this book and have no temptation to finish it. Both characters are whiny and all they do is yell at each other. The supporting characters are bland and are very one dimensional. It's a very frustrating read."
1,not worth the price,"For a watch that uses the Valjoux 7750, which is a pretty standard, inexpensive chronograph mechanism, that is a EXTREMELY expensive watch. You can get a watch with the same 7750 in it for under $1000. That gold better be worth 5 times its weight."
3,Gold watch,"Is it overpriced? Yes. But you're paying for a SOLID GOLD 18K watch. that's what makes it so expensive. If you need further proof, look at the leather band model for $4k less. Yes, even the band is made of solid 18k gold. Now, that's not exactly something I would spend my money on, but it is a solid gold band. Try pricing one of those anywhere else and you'll find that $10k isn't that ridiculous. It is ridiculous for a watch with this movement, but it's not ridiculous for a solid gold watch with this movement. What they should have done is put in a better movement and sell the thing for $12k. It takes a lot of time and skill to machine a watch case out of solid gold."
2,I dont get it,"So its made out of gold and theres only 250 made, what gives on this? A watch maker that normally sells watches in the range of 2 to 3 hundered bucks puts this thing out for 10k? The other thing that really gets me is they call it ""Fighter Command"", its even stamped on the inside of the face!? Does it really get any cheesier than that?I'm thinking this is some kind of prank and they placed the decimal in the wrong spot when naming the price."
2,Most Info Already In the Help System,"I recently switched from RoboHelp to MadCap Flare. The paper documentation that came with the program was not very detailed. I purchased this book in the hopes that it would help me transition. Most of what was in the book I had already figured out myself using Flare's help system. I was expecting something with much more detail and more examples. While mechanically it is accurate, it left much to be desired especially at $45.00.I would recommend buying a book on Cascading Style Sheets (the area where I had the most trouble) instead of this book.I am anxiously awaiting a book in the vein of ""Teach Yourself Flare in 24 hrs""."
5,"Thank you, Nanna!","Nanna has shared with us the fruits of her cooking and research labors of many years - thank you so much! This book is stuffed full of good information about Icelandic culture, the recipes explained in context and detailed well, that even those who've not been to Iceland can get a ""taste"" of the land. Wonderful!"
5,check for slow leak @ water solenoid b4 buying,"My icemaker didn't work, so I replaced it. But it turned out that there was a slow leak at water inlet solenoid valve. So the ice formed in the tubing and blocked the incoming water from getting into the icemaker when it's time for the valve to fully open. And of course the icemaker didn't get the water to work on. (Now I have a good spare icemaker). I then replaced the solenoid valve (the actual bad part).I would check the incoming water solenoid valve for slow leak, before buying a new icemaker."
5,Replaces old part perfectly,"I got the part in fine shape. It had everything needed to replace the old one, extra different wiring harnesses if needed.It seems like the ice cube tray is the same coated pot metal as the original, not plastic. It looks like plastic because of the coating, but is too heavy, and when I tapped on it, it sounded like metal.So the plastic coating may deteriorate like the factory one did in a few years. Hopefully not.I think the cube tray has to be metal, since it has a heating element against it to warm it up so that the cubes can fall out. The metal will conduct the heat evenly, whereas plastic would not.The new one went in without a hitch.This refrigerator is not currently in use, so I was not able to test it, but I'm sure it's fine."
1,Did not work,"I installed the icemaker, read the suggestions, but it never filled with water. It is supposed to fill when you first cycle it on but it did not. Waited 24 hours like some others suggested but still no water fill. Thought it might be the water valve but was tired of messing with it and finally called a repairman, which I am glad I did. Turns out there was a short in the ice maker and while it would cycle, no power/signal was being sent to the water valve and the ice maker had to be replaced. I checked the return policy which said if it had been used you could not return it, so again, I give, just told the repairman to please fix it. I have ice now, but not with this unit. The repairman believed this was a refurbished unit but was uncertain. Good luck!"
5,"yes, love it","So nice to be able to order these type of products. Even better having ice in my fridge again.Went looking everywhere fro this brand, was a little dated . I finally figures Amazion has everything. I was right. great service, great dealers. Great ice."
5,Ice Maker,Great replacement product. It was a perfect fit and easy to install. There was plenty of instructions and all the cables and plugs needed to accomodate the installation in several different units. Great buy
2,Worked great for about 6 months ...,"This replaced the stock icemaker that worked fine for 7 years. Unfortunately, this item only lasted about 6 months. The gearing seemed to mess up and would always be clicking, never resetting. When I tried to adjust it, it wouldn't stop water from entering the tray and would overflow. If I knew more about how this thing worked I might be able to fix it, but i'm at a loss."
5,Terrific,"This item fullfilled all expectations. It was very easy to install, without problem. Complete and easy to use instructions were included."
5,GLORIOUS ICE CUBES RETURN!,"After months of my procrastination, my wife once again enjoys the non-cube-shaped cubes that this maker makes.Installation was easy like Sunday morning. Search Youtube for Whirlpool Freezer repair and some old dude will guide you through the process."
4,Mostly satisfied.,"Everything that I needed was here. But, I wasn't sure that it was the right one until I got it. Not a lot of info on the product description."
4,Ice Maker,"Quick service from vendor. The unit is what you might expect for this price point, serviceable but pretty light duty, if you want the sturdy model select one of the more expensive items.Seems to work and meet the immediate need."
5,Excellent Product,"The icemaker fit perfectly in our freezer. It was exactly as everyone else said in their reviews. Three screws, one plug, and away we went. Ten minutes tops to replace. So simple. The icemaker was brand new, and was exactly as described on the website. The icemaker was shipped very quickly. I was extremely impressed with my overall experience. Thanks!"
2,Whirlpool Ice Maker,This product isn't doing so good. It is still working but the ice is not consistant in size and the ice maker is making noise like our old one did right before it tore up. :( But it is still going so far. (Keeping my fingers crossed)
1,"DO NOT Buy this item, you will be sorry!","DO NOT buy this item, as the unit you will recieve is not the same as the one pictured, or described. Unit came without shutoff arm, wiring harnesses, installation hardware or instrcutions. Called seller to inquire and was told amazon made a mistake and has the wrong picture displayed. According to the CSR, this has happened to several other people as well. But guess what, for a mere extra $20 they offered to sell me one that looks just like the picture. This is an absolute bait and switch, false advertising, etc...Seller also would not authorize a return or refund. Buy at your own risk! Part number that arrived is W10190965, mfr is FSP. Again, not what was listed in the description...."
3,OK quality - iffy documentation,"This is a very good replacement for the ice maker on my Whirlpool fridge. It's not an exact replacement, but it's definitely comparable. To me, ""very good"" means I didn't have to hack around to make it fit or function. The quality is just OK though.___________________Pros:* Makes ice!* Pretty simple to install* Plastic ice tray instead of the plastic coated metal tray of the OEM. (Plastic coating peeled off and corroded the metal tray and made weird ice. It's a good thing I'm done making babies, because it shed some pretty funky stuff into the ice!)* Good assortment of wiring harnesses and hardware included.___________________Cons:* The instructions were pretty slim and didn't even really apply to this model.* Not as well constructed as the original unit. Definitely more flimsy.* Makes ice pretty slowly. Our old ice maker would fill the bin in a day--even under daily use. This one hasn't filled it yet!* Drops the cubes straight down and doesn't hit the bin every time."
1,P,"This the third identical ice maker I have purchased, and it too is failing. Once the thinly applied paint in the water/cube tray begins to erode, the cubes will NOT dump...they simply adhere to the now bare aluminum. AND, no one wants to replace them or compensate me."
5,Works as described,Installed the ice maker in about 20 minutes. Came with adapter cables for different model refrigerators. Quality seems as good as one.Have had it for a few months now and working perfectly.
3,Does not fit all Refrigerators,Good Product but will not fit my Kenmore be sure you check the models it will fit. Return was easy.
1,Stopped working within two months.,"Shipping was quick and the product arrived in good shape, but only lasted two months before stopped working. I will attempt to return it but have little faith in the this icemaker."
4,Great for the price,This was a very reasonable replacement for my very old ice maker. It went in easly. Only needed minor adjustment for ice cubes to stop over filling the storage bin.
3,Ice maker OK,"the original ice worked flawlessly,the new one works OK,but Ice hangs up in tray and it hums until I clear it.but hay,the price is right and it makes ice.Thanks"
4,Ice Maker Review,The ice maker was the exact replacement for the unit that was in my Whirlpool refrigerator. It installed with no modifications and worked perfectly. I have had the new unit installed for 3 weeks now and I am very satisfied with this unit.
1,Refrigerator Automatic Ice Maker Kit,"Part Number 4317943, be sure this item has the ice tray area in the tan color Teflon coating, and NOT white. This is not a new item as advertised, but a refurbished unit!In my case the ice maker worked for about twenty cubes and froze up, my best guess was the white tray area was not non stick.It was hot and humid August month, I got it fixed, and all the repair guy did was replace 4317943, with the one as in the picture. This unit had the ice tray area in the tan color Teflon, works like a champ.So I am out the additional postage and insurance I had to pay to send the defective unit back. Just a real inconvenience!"
1,2 months,"It is an aftermarket icemaker and it worked ok for a short time but it did not have the side wings that the original icemaker had to direct all the ice cubes into the dispenser; one or two would make their way to the bottom of the freezer, just a nuisance but after two months the timing for the water got longer and it would overfill and stall, I got good at uninstalling and reinstalling. I could change it out in less than 5 minutes including time to melt the ice block with running hot water. The new genuine Whirlpool icemaker cost over twice as much, but without any of the work."
5,Item as pictured/described,This item worked as described. All of the items in the picture were included in the box. It replaced an ice maker from a 17 year old Kenmore model 106.9542812 side by side perfectly. It makes ice much faster than the model it replaced.
5,Ice Maker,This was probably one of the best places i have purchased from at Amazon. delivery came in way before the promised date! Thank you much! I know have ice again!
1,ICE MAKER SENT BACK,"Ice maker was packed poorly and did not work when received. The money spent on shipping both ways ($20.00) would have covered the cost to get a better made item at a local appliance shop - which I ended up doing. Ice Maker was made in China for several different models and very cheaply made, as can be expected from China. Learned my lesson."
2,Received only 1 shutoff arm even though photo shows 2.,"I have no issue with the ice maker. It installed just fine and started creating ice within the a normal period of time. The problem is that the product photo shows that it ships with two shutoff arms, each of varying length. The assembly I received, however, only came with one shutoff arm (which I later learned is too ""short"" for my refrigerator). The issue is that with the short shutoff arm, the ice begins to flow over the bucket before it can reach the shutoff arm to trigger it. I contacted the seller asking them to send me the missing shutoff arm and was told that their item only ships with one (the short one) and that they do not have access to the other arm. I MIGHT have been able to use the shutoff arm from my failing ice maker if I hadn't tossed it before the problem started. Unfortunately, it took a couple of days for the bucket to fill with ice and I had already thrown the broken one away."
1,"okay item and simple to fix, AT FIRST!!!!!","Fixed my icemaker in 10 minutes on my Whirlpool Gold. Removed 3 screws and electrical connector and then installed new icemaker.Simple fix and works as new, at first (day 1)! No more ice damn in fill tray (or flooding freezer)!!!AGAIN, AT DAY 1...***UPDATE...Today, November 14, the icemaker is having the same issues as before spending $48. Flooding the freezer is nice!. Emailed the seller and got ZERO back. Checked the selonoid in back of fridge and works perfect.Tested icemaker via holes ""t"" and ""h"" in front of icemaker. Runs way to long even after adjusting via screw on side. The thing is junk 6-months later.Try a new seller with a better warrenty."
5,Icemaker replacement,"The replacement icemaker went in easily and works well. The part was hard to find locally, and I received it within a few days."
1,Deceptive advertising,"Advertised as icemaker by Whirlpool Corp. It was not a Whirlpool product, but an aftermarket...probably Chinese. Seller would not make it easy for a prepaid return as my Summer home is 90 miles away and he wanted me to return on a given day to meet UPS. In the end it was easier for me to just eat the loss.AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE"
2,exactly what I expected,exactly what I wanted at good price.... Matched the originalone of a perfect a of a of a of
3,"wrong part, prompt refund.","The part number as listed was correct for a replacement of my ice maker, but the part did not fit. The vendor shipped promptly and responded the next day when contacted. I don't think this was the vendor's fault as the included instructions listed the correct part number. There seems to be two different styles of ice maker under the same part number. A picture of the actual unit to be shipped would have prevented this.I give three stars just because the customer service was good, I would buy again from them. ( with pictures though)"
4,It Works,"When our ice maker stopped working (lots of grinding noises and no ice), we decided we needed to act. After the basic online troubleshooting, the obvious became clear - it was broke.More online research showed there were some replacements out there. I chose the Amazon one for both price (reasonable) and security. While I was fairly sure this was the one we needed, with Amazon I felt i had an option if something was wrong.Turns out it was fairly easy to replace, though there was a plastic part that had to be trimmed that was not in the instructions. But looking at the old one and new one it became clear. Once installed it has worked great."
5,Easy Replacement item...,"Seller was fast to ship. Item is not OEM, but fit perfectly and included every possible connecting cord. Seemed to take some time for the first ice cubes after installation, but then rapidly filled. This does not have the crummy black plastic liner that flakes (which is why I was replacing my old one)."
5,Ice Maker for Kenmore,This item was an outstanding replacement for my Kenmore refrigerator. It came with several types of electrical connections to suit Whirlpool Kenmore and other brands. I only needed the one attached. It was easy to install and was working as soon as it reached temperature. It did not even need to be adjusted for size of ice cube (however that is very easy to do) Thanks
3,It's OK,"This was a good ice maker. It fit in our Whirlpool with the freezer on the bottom. But it doesn't tell you how long the wire harness is and this is a short one. We needed the longer one. It seemed to work when we first installed it but after a month or so we returned it. I honestly don't know if it was the ice maker or the wire that was bad, since we had to use the old wire."
4,Great,"This arrived really quickly, just on the day I needed it!No complaints about it. It has bold colours and is easy to hang."
4,"Great for Garfield lovers, beware of Halloween ep 4 toddlers","I bought this DVD for myself. I love Garfield Christmas and wanted it on DVD, lucky for me they had 2 more holiday ep's on it. In my opinion the whole DVD's great, I love it. I played it every day until Christmas watching every episode no matter if it had passed or not.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the Halloween ep is kinda scary for toddlers. My son is 2.5 and was basically shaking, hiding behind me when the ghosts were swirling around when they got to the haunted house and he didn't like the man who told the story either.When my son's around I just play the Thanksgiving and Christmas ep's, When he's gone I play them all. ""Nice touch""..."
4,Great purchase!,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She has always been a big fan of Garfield's Christmas. The video plays well and doesn't have any problems. I wish it just wouldn't have been so dang expensive! The has to be a way to drop the price down a bit!
5,One of the best christmas specials ever,"This is hands down one of the best cartoon specials ever made. It's funny again, and again, and again, and then a few more times. And everyone in the family can watch too.Buy it now if you have not already."
5,Timeless Holiday Treasures,"While Garfield's holiday specials may never equal thePeanuts classics. They do have an endearing charm, all unto themselves. Garfield's Christmas is the most heart tugging of all three specials. Who hasn't chocked up during the final scenes, when Garfield delivers a special letter to Grandma. Its truly worth the price for the dvds. I can't wait to see them again and again."
2,Halloween fun,Got this for a fun Halloween movie because my daughter loves garfield the cartoon on tv. My daughter didn't love this dvd as much because their mouths don't move. It's not like the new Gardfield. They watched it but don't ever ask to watch it again.
3,The Halloween Episode is a little scary,"My four year old had nightmares from the Halloween Episode, lots of ghosts and pirates. The other two are wonderful, just watch out for Halloween with younger viewers."
4,Garfield's Christmas and other stuff,"We had misplaced a TV version of Garfield's Christmas we recorded from the television when I was a child. That copy had become a part of our family Christmas tradition, so I replaced it with this DVD. I really enjoy having Garfield's Christmas back, but the Halloween and Thanksgiving specials just aren't as ""special""--perhaps because they weren't part of my childhood traditions. Still, they are fun."
5,Garfield DVD,"We really enjoyed this DVD. It has three separate holiday stories. We loved the Christmas one the best. I was pleased with the short time it took to come to us, and it came in time for Christmas!"
5,Fabulous DVD,"Garfield, you are awesome! What's better than a DVD with three Garfield specials all in one? I love the Christmas special and watched it every year growing up. If you're a child of the 80's, this DVD will make you feel nostalgic. Love it!"
5,Garfield's the best,My son and I really had a good laugh over the antics of Garfield and Odie.I think we might have every DVD and book available on these two furry friends and their awesome owner. A good watch for all ages.
5,For The Love Of Garfield,This is the perfect dvd for any Garfield lover! Great for reliving childhood memories or for making new ones with your kids!
5,Great for the Holidays,I picked this up for my mom to replace her worn out VHS. The quality is way better than the VHS. Totally worth it!
5,Wonderful DVD,I mainly bought this DVD for the Christmas special. I remember watching it as a child and loving it. I still get the feeling now as I did as a child. It should be a classic. My favorite part will always be the first lighting of the Christmas tree.
3,Garfield holiday celebrations,I was very disappointed in the condition I received this DVD as it was a Xmas present and the outer packagecame torn. I had no choice but to give it in that condition and will be leary of ordering from that company inthe future.
5,Love it,CLASSIC HOLIDAY GARFIELD! We love watching this at the holidays it's like a step back in time to simpler nicer
5,My son LOVES thsi!,"My 7 year old has recently discovered Garfield. Even though he received this in early December, he watched the DVD multiple times (after Halloween and Thanksgiving were long over). Thanks!"
5,Love it!!!,watching these specials bring back good memories from my childhood. I am ecstatic that I get to share them with my son
3,*** 1/2 - Even if you read the other new Sammy bio,". . .you'll enjoy this one as well. I wasn't sure I could take another Sammy Davis, Jr. biography so soon after Will Haygood's recent (and excellent) biography, but the brisk pacing and clear writing drew me in. Fishgall sticks to the major events in Sammy's life and doesn't go overboard with the historical background, but a clear picture of the man and his time emerges. I felt an inordinate amount of attention was paid to Sammy's later years and television appearances, but I appreciated learning more about his children and his third marriage. If you can only read one, read ""In Black and White."" If you're still interested, read Sammy's own books, and include this strong, fair biography."
3,2nd tme around,"Well, this is a beautiful cabinet. But our first one had a hinge that broke and so the left mirror cracked as well! This order is a replacement we paid for. Now we have spare parts! It was about the same cost as replacement parts would have been."
2,looks good but problems,"Awkward outside mount. Sharp metal corners cut my finger and gouged up my wall.Hinges do not disconnect from cabinet.There are similar products to this without all the baggage and at a lower cost.Probably works better as an internal mount, but if you are planning to hang it on the exterior side of the wall you should look elsewhere. In either case watch out for the sharp corners"
2,"3 broken hinges, one shattered mirror, excellent customer service",Put four of these great looking cabinets into two bathrooms during remodel 3? years ago. One hinge broke forcing door to stay open so I pulled pieces of the plastic hinge out until the door would close. Second hinge broke on the same door. I did the same thing and now there is no spring to hold the door closed. This morning our son closed the door on the cabinet in his bathroom and the mirror shattered right at the point of the hinge like a spider web with the bottom hinge at the center point. Not a good thing to happen in a bathroom with bare feet! Thanks for everyone's input! I'll call Kohler tomorrow morning and then append my comments. . . Kohler replaced the mirror door and all of the broken and unbroken plastic hinges quickly and no cost.
1,"Hinges broke, shattering door","This product was installed in our rental home, and the plastic rails that support the mirrored door frame broke with no stress put on them. The door fell, shattering the mirror and gouging the marble countertop and now we have to replace, though it was a faulty item. Don't buy this."
3,Defective hinge but great customer service,"Just like the other negative reviews here described, the hinge on the door broke, causing the glass to shatter. I called Kohler and they're sending a new door and hinges for free. Not impressed with the product, but very impressed with the company. Hopefully the second door won't have this issue."
2,Poor hinge engineering creates dangerous situation,"The cabinet is unremarkable except for the fact that the hinges are grossly under engineered. In under 2 years of normal use, the lower hinge suffered a complete failure, leaving only the single upper hinge to support the door. While were were able to order replacement hinges, the fact remains that the hinge design itself, which uses a plastic ""spring"" internally - and the plastic is what failed - is wholly inadequate for the repetitive stresses the door will experience.There is an incident on Saferproducts.gov [...] - that shows the kind of damage hinge failure can cause. I would avoid this product."
2,Hinges broke,"Bought this about 2 years ago. Nice appearance and were happy up till now. The hinges have a black plastic component on the interior of the hinge. The plastic snapped and then one door wouldn't close. The hinge on the other side broke about 6 months later and now neither door closes. I can't find replacement hinges that match. If I can't find a replacement I'll be forced to rip out the whole freakin thing and replace it after only two years. I wouldn't buy this product online and if you do, then validate the hinges prior to installation. If they have plastic in it, they WILL break after some time. Another reviewer also commented on bad hinges."
3,Almost Perfect,"Overall the cabinet was worth the money. However, the hinges on the doors are exposed whether you surface mount the unit or recess it.It does not have a very attractive side view."
5,I LOVE these dragonflies!,These are beautiful and very sturdy. They look so beautiful lining the paths of my pond garden that I bought a second box! :D
2,Disappointed with this Logitech Mouse,"I have used several types of Logitech optical, wireless Mouses (?) over the years. My satisfaction with their products led me to search for a new mouse. I located this item for a very modest price. Once I had it connected to the computer it did not perform at all like I expected. In fact I was so frustrated with re-entering mouse info everytime I had to reboot, I finally tossed it and am still using my old Logitech Optical Mouseman which still performs beautifully. I do not recommend this particular model."
2,The Place: Prague,"A good-for-nothing secret agent, Mark Girland, who has a distinct weakness for money and women, finds himself in Prague for his latest adventure. Events in the Communist country prove all too much for Girland as he comes face to face with a sinister world of deception, fraud and corruption. The result is another gripping thriller from the James Hadley Chase Library."
5,A Arduous by Necessary Journey Through the Old Testament,The confusing effort to read and understand the teachings of the Old Testament is made easier in Walter C. Kaiser's book. It will inspire the reader to read for more than understanding the basics. It will make it reader want to become an expert.
5,Item in perfect condition,Item was just as described by seller. Kids were able to pop it in and start lessons right away!
5,Don't Ask... It's All In EXTASY :D,"Ask any Latino and they'd most probably sing in unison ""Piel Morena... Ay caramba"" :DIf my reason for listening to Latin Music is ""Amor A La Mexicana"", ""En Extasis"" is my reason to die for it. I'd die for every note played, I'd die for every voice Thalia sang in this album.If people find me overenthusiastic, so go and listen to the CD yourself... NO ONE ELSE CAN EVER DO IT BETTER THAN THALIA, EMILIO ESTEFAN JR., KIKE SANTANDER, THE CRESCENT MOON TEAM.I adore LATIN MUSIC. I adore every bit of an EMILIO ESTEFAN JR. product. I'd be a slave for Thalia's one note of ""Quiero Hacerte El Amor"".This CD is not essential, this CD is THE SIGN FROM GOD, MAKING US BELIEVE IN HEAVEN ON EARTH.As the Americans say... THALIA ROCKS!!!"
1,"pure trash, please do not think all latin music is this bad!","Thalia brings another TERRIBLE album, her music is absolutly forgetable, no talent at all, here in mexico she was just a bad actress with great body, it is amazing what a good producer can do with such a lousy girl.... imagine Thalia unplugged...hahaha.... if u are searching for GOOD latin music please search for Cafe Tacuba or Caifanes..."
1,Puzzling?,It is amazing that intelligent African people in America or anywhere else could find anything useful in this book pf pseudo-Black Hebrewism. I gave this book a one start rating because Amazon will not allow you to give zero stars!
2,"Cooking, wow...",I bought this book to use and to learn from and to teach with to the scouts. I found it to be just a blaa and not to great. but in all its not bad nor great.
3,Good but needs some work.,i expect this cd to grow on me but right now it hasn't. it has some good songs on it but its not that dark. its definately a more layed back album unlike the tales from the lotus pod. i guess i along with other people i am not the biggest of fans of it right now is because it doesn't have more likeable hooks. sure hooks are for posers but songs like doornail dorothy just have to be skipped. maybe a month from now i will come back and say the album is better than i thought but right now if your thinking about buying black rain instead of tales from the lotus pod u have to take tales from the lotus pod.
2,Pretty dissapointing follow up,"When Dark Lotus was first conceived 8 years ago, they were advertised as the wickedest, darkest thing that Psychopathic has ever done. ""Tales From the Lotus Pod"" was pretty close to delivering that, but this doesn't even come close. The only good songs are ""Pass the Axe"" and ""Jump Off"" and the rest is pretty crappy. They should've let ROC produce the whole album, because he knows how to lay down some sick wicked beats."
3,lotus,this is not a great album. if u liked the first dark lotus album then dont get this. the album needed more thought and time to make but i think that if you like all the psychopathic family together then get this.MCLMFL
1,Crap On Disc,"I hate this cd. I love ICP, Twistid, Blaze, ABK, and the 1st Dark Lotus. The cd is a waste of money and time. The flow throughout the entire cd is the same. The beats are lame as hell. It seems as though they are picking on the stupidity of thier fan base. I hated the beats so much I could not concentrate on the lyrics but the ones I did manage to hear were okay. F-Black Rain DO NOT BUY THIS ""ALBUM"", SEND ME YOUR MONEY INSTEAD AND I'LL PRETEND YOU HAVE DIGNITY.Love,Whatevermynameusetobe"
3,Half and Half,"Let's call this cd what it actually is; half good, half bad. The tracks are entirely hit or miss here. If you've loved Tales From The Lotus Pod or The Opaque Brotherhood, you'll likely feel the same way as I do about this album. It's the worst album Dark Lotus has done. But it does have some killer tracks that make it worth owning. Simply put, the album is so-so. But you'll probably love tracks like My First Time, Pass The Ax and Ka-Boom! There are certainly better albums out there to be had by Psychopathic Records. But there are also worse. At least preview this before you buy it."
1,Description of product use was not accurate.,"This product was advertised as one that would work with my linear garage door opener and it did not work. Because I had opened the product to set it up for use I was no longer able to send it back. So, I am out $30+ and I have a plastic gadget that is worthless to me.A rep. from the co. was very kind when I called about my problem.I recommend just purchasing a ""Clicker"", a universal remote. I got it at a hardware store and it works perfectly!"
2,You do not get what is promised,"The set is described as including a polarization filter (this is why I chose that set).It came with a yellow No 15A filter instead.There is no point discussing the quality of an article if it is not what was promised, that is why it gets only 2 stars."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this ring for my wife as a gift. She loves it! The quality is excellent, and the three rings fit very nicely on her finger."
4,Beautiful ring!,"This was a Christmas present for my girlfriend. The ring was gorgeous, however, it was quite a bit thicker than I intended. The individual bands are pretty thick, and combined, it is a bit larger in girth than I had planned. But altogether, good ring."
4,nice ring for a special someone!,I decided to buy two of these rings for myself. I was facinated by the unusual illusion of the three rings. I bought these for myself and a special someone as a token of love and they are well worth it.
5,I love this ring!,"I wear this as a thumb ring and it's so fun! It easily swivels through the rings when you're playing with it, but stays in place when you're not."
1,Incompatibility with modern Operating Systems,"As the seller finally pointed out, the description of the program cited suitablity for Dos & windows 98 Operating Systems. Unfortunately I didn't read this detail and even though the seller and I tried hard to find a way to install or even run the program form the CD, we were not successful. I think anyone considering the purchase of this program seriously address it's compatibility with your OS. I've returned the program and can only hope for a reasonasble refund."
1,Boring--Star Trek stuck in a cave,"The back cover of the book, and Amazon description of this book are different than the actual story inside the book.I just finished Book One of this series (which I got from the library) and this book is pretty dull. 90% of the book is about being trapped in a frozen cave.There are sub-plots of course but this book was a real disappointment.I have book 2 and 3 of this series still to read.The only one of the series that I paid for was book 3 and I will probably regret having done that.Unless you can get this book for free at the library, or used for a [money amount], then I wouldn't waste my time or money on it.The Errand of Vengeance series by Kevin Ryan is a bit childish but much better than this series has been so far.If you want to buy a series, then buy that one instead."
2,Uninteresting,"What takes place between the pages of this novel bears little resemblence to the back cover description. Set within the original 5 year mission, immediately after the episode ""The Naked Time"" the story is uninteresting and the characters fall flat. Save your money on this trilogy, it's very disappointing."
3,Good but not Great,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. The story on the back cover bears no resemblance to the story between the covers, but what you do get is a pretty good read. Going is a bit slow at times, with more discussion about geology and cave exploration than I really would've cared to read, but this *is* the setup for a trilogy, so who knows what'll end up being important by the end of the story arc?I love Star Trek books that exlpore the ramifications of decisions and actions from television episodes, ad in that regard, this book does shine quite brightly. I suspect the rest of the trilogy will follow suit. This is the first book I've read by L. A. Graf, and while it's not a Peter David read by any stretch of the imagination, it's a fun Star Trek romp. Probably won't go into my permanent collection, but I'm glad I read it anyway. Besides, as I said, that could change depending on the rest of the trilogy."
2,Fun but not much more,"I read all three in this series. I have also read several other books by L.A. Graf. I have never found Mr. Graf's original series characters to have much insight or depth. The same holds true for this trilogy. The plot is okay but nothing new - unintentional time travel. These books are a brief diviersion, but not much else."
3,Over all this is a worthy read.,"I found this opening book to the Triology to be very interesting. I liked the new twist on this story line. You will recognize some of the missions they embark on, if you are a fan of the original Trek series. One rarely gets to see how things are really run from the perspective of security and, from a Klingon posing as a human, no less. His insight into the workings of his human shipmates develops from one of distaste to one of respect. Which leads to a better follow up for the second book of the series.You do not get a full dose of Kirk and Spock, sinse security training takes center stage, but the whole cast is there. If you would like to see how the other half lives, read this book."
3,whats going on,I have found most Star Trek books can be read before or after another and still follow the story. This book doesn't make much sense. The review on the back doesn't match the story and the first couple of pages deal with a planet and virus that are not explained. I feel better after reading others comments and knowing I am not the only one that feels this way. Being a die hard Star Trek fan I will not let one confusing issue spoil my reading. Thanks for your service in letting us air are comments
2,Not That Great,"Though I love Tito Puente, I was just not all that impressed by this CD. In fact, the lackluster songs left me very disappointed."
5,The picture does not do the set justice,I just received this set a week before Christmas. I am so glad that I went with this bedding set. The price is absolutely worth it when you see the quality you are getting. This set is thick and super soft! The colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. This set was $10 cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else and the shipping was free. It arrived within 3 days. I cannot wait to use this bedding set for my baby girl when she arrives. You will not be disappointed with this set. It's made so well that it should last for a long time.
5,Great finish of a fabulous trilogy!,"Hinz wraps up the trilogy with a major chord! Fascinating finish, probably the best action Sci-Fi book I have read in my life! My favorite book in the paratwa saga."
3,Decent 14k yellow gold jewely for $89,"The diamonds on the eyes are good, but those on the back are very poor."
2,Difficult read.,"This book is not the best academic prose, dealing less with the issues than with scripts. You will learn about what people are saying, but it probably won't inspire creative thinking."
4,Second time around: not necessarily better than the first....,"I am very glad I gave the Lymond Chronicles a second read--they hold up extremely well. However, they are not without problems. The volumes are incredibly bloated. Each could easily be 100-150 pp. less. Also, the back and forth between Francis and Philippa is enough to try the patience of a saint. Abelard and Heloise didn't agonize this much. Ditto Marthe and Jerrot. And I know this is a Romance, but come on DD...Romantic frustration leads to blindness? A literal crush on you?Anyway, there are a few drawbacks. However, everyone who enjoys historical fiction should give this series and the Niccolo Rising adventures a go. Dunnett is not for everyone, but she is unlike anyone else writing today. Learned, lingual, musical and poetic. Her histories are a great canvas stuffed and teaming to overflow with characters real and imagined wherein she is unafraid to apply rich, vibrant and one is tempted to say...swashbuckling color."
5,absolutely marvellous,"I read the first two books of the Lymond Chronicles at the age of 14 and fell in love with them. Unfortunately (for me) the other four books were never translated into German. Thanks to amazon I own now all of them. Everytime I read them, I discover something new. The characters especially Francis Crawford are rich and attractive. The world of the renaissance comes to life in those books."
3,"Great film, unplayable on U.S. DVD player","This version will not play on U.S video players. This information should be clearly and prominently stated in the Amazon listing.I was able to watch it on my computer, and the film itself is superb, the video transfer good. The sound is a little muddled, but that's undoubtedly because the original soundtrack is muddy.Absolutely worth seeing for the performances of Welles, Baxter, Gielgud, and others. A very moving and clever stitching together of all the Falstaff material from Shakespeare's different history plays. But beware the format issue. Five stars for the movie, zero for the format."
5,Orson Shakespeare,"About 15 years ago, when I first discovered the Orson Welles-Shakespeare film connection, I heard about this film, and lusted after it. It was impossible to get a hold of. Well, I just got it for myself as a Christmas present, and it has absolutely lived up to all the reviews, and all my expectations. If you love Orson Welles, you absolutely must see it. Sure, it's not $12, but it's worth every penny, especially if you love Shakespeare too. Oh, alright, I've convinced myself. I'll watch it again tonight. . . ."
1,NOT a commercially produced DVD,"NOT a commercially produced DVD. Purly made artwork and DVD-R put insideinsted of commercially coated DVD. You can tell just looking at dvd's working surface, even can see CMDR engraving on the outer ring.Clearly NOT Manufactory pressing.Why amazon allows selling home produced dvd?"
4,Orson Welles' Henry IV,"Orson Welles adds another gem to his eccentric classics(The Trial,Don Quixote)with his combined Henry IV Parts I & II."
1,Médiocre fabrication At Home,"Ce DVD est de piètre qualité technique. Ce n'est pas un DVD de pressage. C'est une fabrication At Home . La qualité technique est très médiocre. Pire, que ce que l'on peut télécharger gratuitement en Torrent. De plus ce DVD est illégal. Ceux qui l'on fabriqué ne possèdent pas les droits sur ce film. C'est donc une arnaque."
3,Caveat Emptor,"FYI - Amazon combines reviews across different versions and sometimes this is unhelpful. This review is specific to the ""Hollywood's Attic"" (aka ""Nostalgia Family Video"") version (it has a pink/orange cover with a drawing of Welles as Falstaff) as opposed to the Brazilian/Portuguese version (close-up sepia-toned photo of Welles and Jeanne Moreau on the cover). [Not a child as I'd originally thought]I'm not going to argue quality of transfer or mastering as I'm really not a great judge of those things. I do want to warn people that the copies available here seem to all be DVD-R's and not commercially produced DVD's.This, of course, means that they won't last as long and are more fragile. The film is perfectly watchable - I just thought people should know before they buy (and the sellers don't seem to be inclined to put this in their listings - which I find somewhat shady)"
2,There is a reason for a low price,"There is no such thing as a free lunch. And there is not such thing as 80% discount for nothing. This tie is indeed handmade. It is handmade to the point that it feels a bit too homemade. The tie is heavy and the texture is fine but it is not sitting smooth. It is being pulled in all directions due to errors in stitching or an initial cut. Perhaps it possible to iron out all the taylor's erros, however, I think it will never be completely smooth. Ironing won't change the cut. Therefore, although the tie is made of silk and made by hands, it is not a winner due to defects in design. It could be just my purchase.The cufflinks are very mediocre. They are small, look like ""upholstered"" buttons. I did not realize that the cufflinks would be covered in fabric. Fabric cufflinks aged this set by 20 years, in my opinion."
3,"Interesting, but Mediocre","Embrace the Serpent is an interesting novel, albeit one with any number of noticeable flaws. I understand that it's somewhat unsurprisingly out of print for a number of years--I picked it up at a used bookstore and having always liked Dan Quayle, I was interested in what his wife had written.Embrace the Serpent begins with the death of Fidel Castro and follows the efforts of both the Cuban freedom movement and the Russian backing of Fidel's brother Raul as both sides make a desperate grab for power.Overall, I liked the book, but there were a few laugh-out-loud moments of awful writing and I thought the ending was overly Hollywood. If you can find it used for a few dollars, I'd recommend picking it up for some quick entertainment. Incidentally, the Northcott/Quayle combo improved themselves with their follow-up novel: The Campaign."
3,I love my country....,"But, this flag, wasnt to my quality standards, but i guess i cant complain too much, as the price was right. I did end up spending time removing loose threads, but after all the extra work i put into it, it fit my quality standards."
3,"A Review of ""Sing a Song of Sixpence""","Your classic poem with the lovely, classic artwork of Randolph Caldecott.Three Stars. Would I buy this book? Because it has only the one poem, no. Not unless I were going to remove the artwork (which has no words) and frame it for a child's room. [Which this bibliophile probably couldn't do--lol]"
1,"This CD really, really sucks!","I am a Colombian die-hard music lover and since I totally love stuff like El Bloque (maybe the best thing ever made in Colombia), Carlos Vives and Aterciopelados I cannot hide my disappointment with this CD. It's been 4 years since the last time I heard them and I was surprised 'cause they haven't changed a bit! They still make that horrible-despicable-simplistic-girlish-foolish-elevator kind of ""music"", music made by retards for retards! They could really use a couple of classes in harmony and composition..."
5,very nice CD with excellent lyrics,This is a very good CD with high quality arrangements.it is a very interesting fusion of colombian music and international rock and pop. I think this is a very good sample of alternative rock. Este es un CD muy bueno con arreglos musicales de alta calidad. pienso que este cd es una muy buena muestra del rock alternativo. Buena por estos colombianos
5,JUANES JUANES!!!,"EXCELENTE!! Totally great!, I even like this earlier work more than the latest he's come up with... great songs, it has all the cool hits!"
5,Enjoyed it even more the Second Time!,"I underline and make notes in my books. LeAnne's book contains as much of my ink as hers! I love the way she writes. Every line is sheer poetry...Did not know LeAnne nor the subject of her book. This turned out to be one of my top five favorites ever!She can convey more thought in one line than some writers do in a chapter. I am now engaged in my first read of her second book. I know that I will be doing a second read as soon as I finish.If you are a frustrated writer, you have to ""study"" this wonderful book. LeAnne Schreiber is simply the best!"
5,ONE BOOK YOU CAN'T HELP BUT READ OVER AND OVER.,I FOUND THIS STORY TO BE VERY ENTERTAINING AND MOTIVATING. I WAS INSPIRED BY TIM DAGGET'S COURAGE AND DETERMINATION. THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK AND CONTAINS MANY INTRIGUING FACTS ABOUT TIM DAGGET AND GYMNASTICS
5,Very good quality!,"If you are at all familiar with Emile Henry stoneware, this piece lives up to every expectation that I had. It is a beautiful deep color and it is safe in the dishwasher, oven and freezer! I am now a collector of these pieces!"
1,Doesn't work.,Unfortunatly this affordable product does not work at all with my system. The software which comes with the product crashes on launch. I downloaded various other video capture software and none of them could record from this device.Spend more: get something that works.
5,Ty 2k is fun!,My daughter loves Ty 2k! She has renamed him Party animal and she makes him play with her other stuffed animals. Her grandma actually bought it for her at Crafter's alley.
4,An unusual view of America's Civil War,"This book was Vanauken's thesis work while at Oxford, presenting a neglected and unusual viewpoint of England's position on the American Civil War. Vanauken's views on ""The War Between the States"" won't draw much of a following nowadays, but that doesn't mean they are incorrect or misleading. To the contrary, Vanauken forces the reader to rethink long accepted dogma about America's bloodiest conflict, and why England never entered the fray. American Civil War fans will enjoy reading this book."
2,not worth it,"The Styra is only OK as a replacement stylus. It's not as nicely finished as the original T|X stylus -- it's a dull, textured finish instead of the shiny -- and it doesn't have the nice heft of the original. The soft working end isn't as soft, either. The pen seems fine, and is the only reason to tolerate the thing. If it cost half as much I'd be less negative, but it's too expensive for what it is."
3,just OK,This stylus is not nearly of the quality as the one that comes with the Palm but I do like that it has a built in ballpoint pen for those times when a paperless world isn't possible.
4,Better than Bose,"I own the Bose and looked at the price and the reviews and decided to get this for my office. I am VERY happy with it. The price was more than reasonable. The sound is far better than the Bose, even though the bose is good as well. This, however, seems to have far more depth and distribution of the sound. The ONLY complaint I have is that when you go to turn it on, the default volume is louder than I would like given I am in an office. It blasts untill I can get it turned down. Not a problem, just an annoyance."
3,Where is the service?,"The iGroove is not compatible with several new ipod models. The adapters sent in the box did not work. Klipsch's website claims that they will provide appropriate adapters. I have contacted them 3 times - with absolutely no written response and unfortunately no adapters have been received yet. It might be a cool sounding system, but I don't know quite yet!"
5,Incredible sound!,"This speaker system is great! I'm always amazed at the quality of the sound coming out from these portable speakers...incredible sound for a great price, really!...it was a present for my husband and he absolutely raves about it to all of his friends...and we love the fact that it is portable, we take it everywhere."
4,Best buy for an Ipod docking speaker,"I own Klipsch home theatre system so I guess I am biased towards this product. However, I think the sound quality is awesome. The only gripe I have for this product is that the remote works only if it is pointed directly on the speaker."
5,"Great product, good sound. Easy to use","Definitely highly recommended. Good booming sound, easy to use, stable on a table, looks decent. Not cheap, but it's the best product that I've heard from a small-ish unit."
5,Beyond All Expectations,"I own several of the iPod docks, including the iKick by Kicker and the Bose portable iPod docking & charging stations. I also have the iGroove sxt by Klipsch. I didn't ever get a chance to listen to the iGroove HG although reports from my friends were very favourable. When the opportunity to buy one came up, I just couldn't resist. I bought one through E-bay. I have to say this puppy exceeds all expectations. The sound is faithful & true. Crisp highs and astounding bass levels. This machine would have made Paul W. Klipsch very proud. I'm an avid audio toy collector and this, my friends, is a keeper. The sound is thrilling. Thanks Paul."
4,Sounds Great!,"Sounds great, looks great. My only complaint is that if you power the speaker system on it automatically goes to a preset volume, that may be higher than desired. I usually pause the iPod, turn the system on, turn the volume down, then hit play on the iPod."
4,Klipsch iGroveHG,"The sound for the iGrove is very good and met my expectations. However, iGrove does not interface with iTunes which severly limits its utility."
1,Broken after 16 months - piece of garbage/do not buy!!,"My iGroove broke 16 months after purchase. The warranty is for 12 months only. I barely used it, real piece of garbage to break with moderate to light use over a 16 month period. Spend the extra money and get the Bose, don't waste your time and money on this poorely built immitation."
2,Mushy sound,"The sound is almost all mushy bass, lacking any clarity, definition and midrange. I've heard better units costing half as much. Never again."
4,Klipsch igroove,Very good sound. Very good bass response. AC cord a little bulky. Does not charge iphone.
5,Excellent Value,"This unit has a great sound. It is also versatile in that it accomodates non-Apple mp3 players as well. AT about$80, it is a heck of a deal."
5,Great sound,Don't be fooled by the size of this iPod dock. The sound that comes out of this thing is amazing!!! This is the best sounding dock I have ever heard.
3,Only one problem,"I purchased the Klipsch iGroove based on the lower price and advice from several reviewers online that the SoundDock and the iGroove were approximate equals. I loved the Klipsch with the exception of one significant flaw. The bass would buzz and hum on about 5-10% of the tracks - other reviews downplayed this flaw, but it became quite annoying and I returned the unit in favor of the SoundDock. The SoundDock doesn't have any problems with sound. It is what it claims to be: a quality small stereo for iPod; a rough equivalent to a good quality boom box. I'm keeping the SoundDock. The only issues are the relatively high price and that the unit isn't nearly as solidly built as the Klipsch. The construction doesn't seem to affect the sound however, and I don't foresee moving the unit so I'm happy as is."
3,ipod speakers,"I'm a huge music lover and to hear it in its best quality is highly important. Budget wise this product is fair. it does produce adequate sound but it didnt ""fill"" my small apartment living room they way other reviews stated it would. i like the design and size but i was slightly disappointed with the sound. for someone like myself that really appreciates music to its fullest i will search for another ipod sound system and pay more. if u like bass i would not get this product as it kinda shakes when you turn up the volume."
3,Are you sure this is a Klipsch?,I have Klipsch RF-7 speakers and have had nothing but Klipsch audio since 1983....this product does not live up to Klipsch quality and certainly doesn't even come close to the legendary Klipsch sound. Stunned at how much audio distortion there is even at moderate volume levels. Would also be nice if there was at least a clock included. Overall just not up to Klipsch standards. I'd say look elsewhere for this kind of money.
5,Klipsch iGroove All in one shelf system,"Product came immediately, was packaged wonderfully. Plugged iPod nano in and the sound was awesome. Company delivered as promised and more. even when I dont listen to the music, my ipod is being charged. My children even used their ipod shuffles in it and the results were just as great. The quality of sound is wonderful, even with classical music."
4,Solid product,"I bought the Klipsch because there was no way I was spending the money they wanted for the Bose and because there were a lot of favorable reviews of the Klipsch. I concur. The sound is great. For my ears, it fills the room and the clarity is excellent. What kept this from getting 5 stars was the loose fit of the iPod in the dock. There is a small sliding thingy that helps fit the iPod so it hits the connection right on, but the recess that the Pod fits in is a little big. The result, for me, has been a bit of rattle when the bass kicks in. I modified the slider thing with some sticky backed foam and now the system is solid, but you shouldn't have to monkey around like that. Still, I recommend this as great sound for a good price."
4,Fantastic sound quality!!,"My husband bought this docking station as a gift for me, he did alot of research before buying it. I think it sounds incredible and its easy to use. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
5,"Great purchase, two for the price of one",Rio Conchos is one of my favourite western movies probably due to the powerful performance of one of my all time admired actors in Richard Boone of Have Gun Will Travel fame. Other famous actors in Stuart Whitman and Anthony Franciosa also put in magnificent performances in this highly action-packed western. The other movie sees reknowned actor Lee Van Cleef who makes another memorable performance. Jim Brown heads the stong cast who is a standout in another gripping western. A great double for western fans.
3,Western,As a big richard Boone fan I was disappointed in this movie. Same goes for the second film with Lee Van Cleef.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have been using Test Prep Books since I started my MSCE. I managed to pass all my exams on firsrt attempt. IIS4 was my last exam. This book does not even come close to what is required in the exam. The content and examination questions are very, very poor."
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could!!,This book is great IF you want to learn how to install IIS and learn what each of the tabs/properties do. As far as preparing you for the exam... NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! I found ZERO questions in the book even remotely similar to the exam. I wish I would have seen these reviews first.
1,Do NOT buy this book if you want to pass your exam!,"Although there have been many negative comments posted already about this book I just had to add mine. This book is misleading, it does NOT cover the topics you will require in order to pass. There is only one way to pass - sit down and learn how to use Microsoft Management Console so well you could do it blindfolded. This book is a waste of time and resources, you will not find ONE single question in the book that even remotely matches what you'll experience in the exam. The exam is a LOT harder than the test questions, 25% of the exam is simulation examples with MMC, this book doesn't even touch on it. I don't know what planet Emmett Dulaney comes from, but they sure as hell don't sit the same IIS4 exams as the one we are all on. Heed our warnings in the extreme!"
1,Useless,"None of the questions in this book are even close to what was on my exam. Only thepartabout IDC,IDQ and other files is worth reading. Probably the worst book I have encountered during my studies."
1,Not a good help!,"None of the ""over 500 Practice questions"" was even close to the real IIS 4 test that I took yesterday. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,"Good, but not complete enough","This book is inexpensive, methodical and no nonsense, but it omits some very important and/or basic endings. The main class of omissions is between different kinds of pieces: R vs N and/or B, Q vs R, Q vs R+P, R vs R and B (it does cover B vs N); and the basic mates. It's good didactically, but there's better. It's halfway between a reference manual and an introduction to endgames. I loved my copy and it's tattered from use, but while the old general chess instruction books (like Lasker's Manual of Chess) have not been surpassed, today's endgame books are your best bets. I recommend Jesus de la Villa's ""100 Endgames You Should Know"" for learning, and later, as a reference manual, something like ""Fundamental Chess Endings"" or ""Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual."""
4,GREAT BOOK FOR GOOD PRICE ! A 4 1/2 STAR BOOK,What more can we say about a book whose author is no other than former World Champ Dutch player Dr.Max Euwe ? An exhaustive coverage of all the probable cases in end-theory with excellent annotations too. A must-buy for every serious player.The sequence of the chapters is somewhat erratic..but on the whole superb book..A `Bhagwad Gita' for all who wanna make it big in Chess.
2,Great but not,"I bought this mouse for a friend. the rubber feel on the mouse is great and feels good on your hand. the mouse is very small and takes a bit to get used to. but the major downfall THIS THING EATS BATTERIES! really bad. i replaced with a microsoft that changes batteries once in 6 months, were i was replacing batteries 2or 3 times a week."
1,Crappy battery compartment,"The contacts for the battery are attached to the mouse cover, which, by design, can't be fastened very securly to the mouse. So, if, as you are using the mouse, you nudge the cover a bit, you're mouse switches off! Extremely frustrating.Get another mouse. This one looks good, but is extremely frustrating to use."
4,great plane but get ready to buy parts!!,"I got this plane for fathers day and have been playing with it/repairing it ever since. It's a easy plane to fly and i also recommend flying it on expert mode because it's so easy. I have however, crashed it a few times and have had to buy a few parts.They were fairly cheap! If you are not handy don't buy this plane. Here is my advice for learning to fly this plane.1) Learn how to land the plane first.Hand launch it, let it fly straight for a few yards and then land it. 2) Don't fly the plane with full throttle until you have gained experience, the plane will glide and you can still have control over it's movement. 3) when you crash(not if) the plane, look over the plane for missing parts and then search the crash site. Thats what i have learned so far. I have flown the plane maybe 4 or 5 times now and i am fairly comfortable with. It's very fun and easy. Just go easy on the gas!!!"
3,Don't expect too much,"This was my first R/C plane. I read good review on other sites about it and found a good deal on the RTF kit. It does fly pretty well, but the responce is a bit sluggish in the controls. I can tell the difference now that I fly other planes with real control rods, not lines and elastics as the SkyFly has. The SkyFly has proprietary parts in it, so you cannot easily fix parts if your ESC, RX or servos break (it doesn't even have standard servos). I broke the tail boom on my second flight and replaced it with a section of a fishing rod."
2,Five minutes of fun for $100,"We spent a lot of time searching for an rc airplane that wouldn't fall apart the minute we took it out of the box. We chose this one for my son's 13th birthday - he was extremely excited. My husband put it together and thought 'wow this looks pretty good.' They practiced a few times and it took several nosedives - no problem. They took it out to a bigger field - one of the wheels broke off on takeoff. The next time they launched it out of their hand. The final flight lasted a good 3 minutes but upon trying to land, the wing hit the ground first and broke off completely. It's a shame they don't make something that can maintain integrity with normal use. For the price, we thought this would be the one - not so. The merchant won't replace/refund so it's a shame my son's big 13th birthday present isn't something that he can use over and over for a log time."
4,"works fine, once you get the software installed","I am running a Dell Axim x30. Once I got the software installed on the PDA, the wireless card worked fine. One star is taken away because of the extra effort needed to get this to work that could have been avoided.I have been using the Mark/Space software for Mac to syncronize calendar and contacts with this PDA. This will also allow you to install programs for PocketPC provided in the form of Windows CAB files. The only thing on the AmbiCom WL11-SD driver CD was an installer for a Windows host PC. I was able to find a friend with a Windows PC, run the installer, and then grab the CAB file to install the software on my Mac. This hassle would have been avoided had AmbiCom simply provided the CAB file on the driver CD."
1,Not Palm Compatable,"This SD card is not Palm OS compatable, so if you do not have a windows PDA, don't get it. I made the mistake of buying this for my new Tungsten E2, and it doesnt work. Be forewarned."
3,I thought it would be smaller,"I bought this to use in my ""smart"" phone. Come to find out, my phone is smart, butt I am knot.Phone uses micro-sd size and this is regular sd.Soooooo, I put it into my desktop and now have a wireless desktop and an extra 25 foot long ethernet cable. Seems to work well for the price. Ethernet cable does not fit the stupid smart-phone either. Come to find out, the making of micro-sd wireless cards was a massive flop and they are not available.I wound up also buying a Kindle FIRE to use for mobile webbing (when near a wi-fi hotspot). Fire is pretty cool. Butt that is probably a review for another time and hotspot location.Party On,Okie Tokie"
1,It does not work with PPC2002,"Unlike mentioned compatible with PPC2002. I tried with my near Paper Weight Samsung SPH-I700 with PPC2002, simply does not see the card. WL11_SD 802.11B Wireless card with Rev2.5 is not compatible with PPC2002."
2,"Should be ""basic wreck diving,"" not ""advanced""","Can't argue with Gentile's credentials as a diver, but his book leaves a lot to be desired. It gives a lot of very basic information and hints, all of which are covered in the PADI wreck diving course. And much of the information he provides is generic to any kind of diving. This book would serve as a decent reference for a beginning wreck diver, but if you've been down on or in more than two wrecks already, this book won't tell you anything new."
3,Interesting and Quick,"I ussually eat through books pretty fast and this one went especially quick. It was an intersting book and VERY DRAMATIC! I thought it was worth reading, but I wish they would have had more about the horses. I liked it , as a quick read, but it does contain some swearing, which I'm okay with, but others might not be."
4,"Allthough it's cute, it was a lie.","I own this Beanie, along with 200 others. Allthough it's adorable (along with almost every other beanie), the purpose of it was so overated. This Beanie Baby was supposed to represent the last beanie and the end of TY Beanie Baby productions. That's all hype and lie because a month or two later after this came out guess what else did?: The Beginning Bear. Anyways, TY fooled the press, publicity, and public with this bear. Still, if you want it, I guess it would make a good set to go with The Beginning. Overall, if you don't think about the complexity of what this Beanie brought, it's a cute childs toy."
4,"""END THE BEAR"" COLLECTIBLE FRENZY!","When I first saw this 'lil fellow, I knew, without a doubt, that he would become a rare collectible. The company played it's trump card by limited production and proclamation of ending (no pun intended) the toy line. Collectible frenzy insued. A beautiful market ploy and a start to making this cute, little black bear most sought after."
5,Oh no!,"This beanie is very soft and shiny,not to mention adorable.I just can't believe this is the end of the beanies!"
2,leaves my skin greasy...,i dont like olay products. the body wash leaves my skin oily. yuk! it smelled ok but it had no name.
4,V. Expensive.,Feel gr8 after the shower. Nice aroma and smooth texture.I'd just wish it was a little cheaper.Few more variations need to be introduced soon.
3,I like this but,the delivery was great but the olay body wash was not as good as the last one I used do not know why?? Still a good bath wash but not as good as it was did they change it?
5,Easy to put together and works well.,I bought this adjustable garment rack to hang cold sensitive hanging basket plants on my south porch so I can cover them when it gets too cold for them to be hanging outside from the tree limbs. Works well. The manufacturer stressed a max of 40 lbs and a balanced distribution and I did that and all works well. I can roll them to the front of the porch for sunlight and away from there when cold winds are coming and cover with old sheets. And get to enjoy them on nice days while I sit on my porch.
1,Cheap junk!,Unless you only want to put a couple of light items on it do not waste your time and money on this thing. I put it together and put on about half its stated capacity in clothes or less and it kept falling apart and tipping over. Thankfully Amazon took care of the refund for me!
2,not very sturdy,"I bought this rack as I was running out of room in my closet. I put very light summer clothing on it; and it won't stay up. Either one side folds down or the other. It's not very sturdy, I don't recommend it if you are going to put anything other than a few light shirts."
1,Broke immediately,"I bought this rack without reading the reviews because I thought it was the same one that I had purchased at Target, which is very similar, but has lasted me for years. This rack broke the second I put clothes on it (9 garments). The flaw is in the screws that tighten to adjust the height. They couldn't support the weight of the clothes, so I tried tightening it more and it promptly became stripped and wouldn't tighten at all. I ended up resorting to the old Mainer fix-all- duct tape. Spare yourself the trouble and spend a couple of bucks extra on a sturdier one."
2,Not recommended for more than a few pieces,At this price I figured that it would be worth a shot but didn't realize how wobbly a light-weight garment rack would be. Will be sending back. It's not functional at all.
4,No problem,"The product was exactly what I expected. It is a little flimsy but it is perfect for the price I paid. No complaints here. It serves it's intended purpose? Also, no problems with shipping or delivery."
1,Cheap and Light Weight,"Bought this for choir robes. They maxed out the center pole, it would not stay elevated (Viagra as a fix maybe???) and the plastic end pieces where the wheels are broke. I bought two and managed to make one from parts from the two. Unless you're hanging ballet suits, pass on this item."
1,Don't do it - Very flimsy and fragile.,"Have had this product for about a year now and it has been nothing but a nuisance. It is unstable and very cheaply made. The only hope for it is if you buy it get a good supply of glue and heavily glue every joint.Last night I tried to move it out the way to get to my closet and one of the floor support mountings broke in half at the upright connector. I am looking right now to see if it is fixable and it looks hopeless. I am not handy however.My advice is do what I am going to do, look for a much sturdier unit."
4,garment rack,I love my garment rack. It has been a lovely addition to hang up clothes that would have otherwise been placed in a dresser. I put my everyday things on the rack that makes them easily accessible.
2,Garment Rack,"The Idea is good, but the rails slip down and do not hold. You have to put clothes on the rack very gingerly otherwise the whole thing will slip and perhaps fall."
1,Cannot take a heavy load of clothes,This product was easy enough to mount but on it's first use the plastic part to hold the vertical rods cracked and broke into pieces. There were less clothes on it than in the advertised picture of this product. I would not recommend this product for sale.
1,poor quality,"This rack broke within two days...poor quality. I would have returned it, but it would have cost me more than the product was worth!"
1,CHEAP JUNK,I never had a chance to use it. The plastic cracked when I was trying to screw it in place. So now it can't be raised. I have to use it for knee height items because the return process was too confusing!!!
1,"Adjustable Chrome Garment Rack (Chrome/Black) (32-60"" H x 40"" W x 17"" D)","Don't bother buying this! Once again I didn't read the reviews - shame on me! It broke immediately. Since I need garment racks, I'll try again - this time I'll read the reviews!"
1,poor workmanship,"The product arrived --LATE ---Then, the first time I went to assemble it the wheel holder broke. Outside of the wheel holder breaking, I wasn't real impressed with the stability of the system itself. I have since bought something, around the same price point, that is more stable and better constructed."
5,"Quality Construction, Easy Installation","This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32"" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions. I'd be surprised if you could find something better."
3,The plate is too big,"This arm was recommended for my 23"" Samsung LCD. The plate that must be attached to the TV covers 25% of the rear connectors. There are no directions as to whether it is OK to cut plate down.I question whether screws for the plate are big enough. It would be better, I guess, if the screws were provided with the TV instead of the Plate because I would think Samsung should know what size scews should be right for their TV."
4,would buy again,Good tv mount. Bought it years ago and it is still in use today. Well made and strong. Would buy it again for sure
5,"Great LCD Wall Arm for 32"" Screen","The directions were good, the install was not difficult and this wall arm does exactly what it's supposed to - swivel and tilt. I couldn't be more satisfied!"
4,Solid Wall Mount,"Overall, very happy with this mount. Used it for an Olevia LT37HVS and it works as advertised. A little frustrating that it rotates a little too easily, so it's difficult to get the tv level after moving it in or out. But well worth the price."
3,Not what I expected...,"These are nice stockings, but I thought they would be thinner. I will save them for fall and winter."
5,"Great Product, Great Bargain","Bought this product originally at Whole Foods locally, so I knew I would use the two pack. I have very sensitive skin, and this product does not make me break out. I think it's very effective, would recommend to anyone."
1,I hate it !!!!! Don't Buy it !,"I have been using this "" magic"" lighting cream BIG LIE my brown spots are more dark. Now my entire face is cover with a big brown maskHELP!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Nice E-SATA cable.,"I am using this cable every day, including to run program direct on my external disc and it's being very good...working fine, with good transfer speed. Very good, I recommend."
5,E sata 1 meter cable,"very good quality, works great but its just not very long. before ordering this product remember 1 meter = 3.2808 feet."
3,A little stiff,"These were a bit tough to route and don't like to bend that much. I was afraid of bending to the point of a ""kink"" that might damage the wire within."
3,not great.,"The flag's color was not the right shade of blue, and the flag itself was light, extremly light....almost see-through."
3,Meh.,"I know it's a thermal, but it's suuuuper scratchy to the skin. The material is pretty thin and you can see right through it even though the garment is black. Not a horrible shirt, but it could be better."
4,Cool,"Two Gallants is a new band from San Francisco that may be flying under the radar. They need more attention. They may be part of the folk revival in the Bay Area. They are more into country music and Americana. Two Gallants is much like music from another time re-imagined by two guys in their early twenties. They have been wowing audiences for a few years now. Some of their songs of ""Nothing To You"" have that authoritative voice of records like John Fahey. Two Gallants seem like they are 180 degrees from what is trendy. They are unique and special. They need to be discovered."
2,Prince before he was Prince,"This is just to give a little guidance on this album ... I have an older version of this disc with a slightly different song list, although 4 of the 6 songs are on both albums (the one I have is an old disc titled ""Minneapolis Genius,"" released in 1987).This band really belonged to a guy named Pepe Willie, but he was using Prince as a studio musician. The four tracks on this album I know are ""If You Feel Like Dancin',"" ""Games,"" ""Dance To The Music Of The World"" and ""One Man Jam."" Prince plays guitar, keyboards, synths and drums on standard late-70's r&b disco jams. None of these four songs are credited to Prince as writer or co-writer and he doesn't sing on them either. His early bass player and friend Andre Cymone contributes bass lines to 3 of the 4 songs.Worth picking up only if you're a die-hard Prince/Artist follower and want to hear the first studio recordings of the soon to be famous 18-year-old musician."
2,Average,"I got the Original Album in 85&it was cool at the time.but hasn't dated all that well.still it's cool hearing Prince,&Andre Cymone Playing together early on.Some of the Bass Parts&Keyboard Parts would show up on Prince's Early Albums.this is Mainly For COllectors or Fans not Essential."
1,A Waste of Money,"I had to choose 1 star, but it gets ZERO STARS. This was not what I anticipated at all. Do not waste money on this one. To me, it has nothing to do with Prince at all."
2,Get the original,"This album is a good, but dated album. I do, however, suggest that instead of this one you pick up Minneapolis Genius(Pepe Wille, Andre Cymone, and Prince). It is comprised of this album[94 east] plus ""Just Another Sucker"" and more. This is a ripoff unless you can't find Minneapolis Genius and want to make your collection as comprehensive as you can at the moment."
3,Oky quality... Got it with dirts,Arrived and it has dusts on the lens already.... Not sure how this could have happend.... It looked like some one opened it before me!!
3,"nice, but don't give yourselves high expectations","I like the way I can see things wut the new lens, but it is not the greatest thing. I'm starting with Astronomy and for this reason I wanted a vey basic telescope (which I received like a present few months ago). The lens are helping me to see more deep, but since this is a very basic equipment, you should not expect high quality stuff. This is why the lens are ok, not the best, because it's not possible to have the best with basic equipment."
2,Magnification Great for the Moon,"I wanted to see Mars and a good look at the rings of Saturn. I bought this hoping I could. However, the make and aperature of the telescope you have makes or breaks this lens. It is not a magical looking glass. It did magnify Mars.. so I was able to see a larger white light. I have a Celestron telescope.. but a low end."
3,Reef Gear Review,"This watch has very good features for the price range. I think the warrenty is good, also the waterproof is very much for the depth of water.my grandson is 12yrs old .This will be his frist watch.I think it is an execellant. Bobby Ford"
4,Half a book... Full price (exept with amazon discount) ;-),"Personaly I don't plan to recomend this book to anyone until the sequel comes out because the book is incomplete, none of the plots get solved, not one of the characters grow, you know... it feels like just a detailed explanation of the situation in wich earth and mars where during some of the RAMA books. I'm just hoping that the sequel does not try to fix everything up by having some variation of the RAMA ship or THE EAGLE show up... or worse yet the species that ""almost reached earth"" that we heard about at THE NODE in RAMA REVEALED. I don't know about the copies at amazon.com, but the book I have in my hand reads: ""And coming in late 1996. Double full moon night. The conclusion to the story"". It's late 1997 and no sequel in sight. Mr. Lee: We've read the first 20 chapters... are those your last?"
3,Re-hash of GL's and AC's Rama books,"G Lee used the same formula for Bright Messenger's as he did w/ most of the Rama books he worked on w/ A Clarke. If you recall, the last 3 Rama books were significantly different than A Clarke's solo work on the first Rama. I enjoyed the Rama books, but reading BM was just like the last three Rama books, only different characters. I highly suspect the sequels will continue to be rehashes of the Rama theme. It worked for the first series, why not again? He'd do much better to team up w/ AC (or anybody w/ an original storyline) and do something inovative"
4,So what happened to Double Full Moon Light?,"Like many of your on line reviewers I'm a big fan of the Rama saga and enjoyed Gentry Lee's solo opus. And also like many, am really disappointed that the sequel - or at least the next installment has still not appeared. It would be interesting to see what the publishers have to say about this. Is is that Bright Messengers didn't sell well enough to bring out the sequel? Or has Lee gotten too busy with his other gig?"
5,A Masterpiece!,"This is not at all bad for Gentry Lee's first solo work. If beauty can be defined by a novel, this is it; a very beautiful, very moving piece of art. Johann sticks to logic and reasoning and has only doubts about God. Beatrice is devoted to God and compassion and service to others. They are two very smart but very different characters who, despite their differences, develop strong respect for each other. Readers will learn with these two characters that science and religion can co-exist. This book is part one of two... when I finished I sat silently for several minutes just thinking about what I had just experienced. Finally I snapped out of the trance and vowed to get the sequel as soon as it comes out (March 1999!)"
4,Science vs Religion,Fun read. This is part 1 of a split work (I'm currently reading Double Full Moon Night) for those who want more of the Gentry Lee Rama universe. I wouldn't put it on the must-read for everyone list but it satisfies as an intelligent piece of writing with commentary on the strengths and weaknesses of humanity as would be observed from outside.
3,A good read but not up to the Rama books yet,"The story was fast-paced and intriguing, to a Rama veteran perhaps too familiar, although with different faces. What bothered me was that the 22nd century European political situation and the political and cultural attitudes of the characters had not changed one iota from the 1990's, which seems highly unrealistic. It is also irritating when English authors make careless grammatical errors when including sentences in other languages (in this case, German). Nevertheless, I look forward to reading the sequel."
4,Great book but where's the continuation?,"I really did enjoy this book and several questions from the other Rama series have been answered to fill in the timeline. Unfortunately, more questions have either now been forced from us to ask for the next book NOW or we still have many unanswered questions from the previous Rama books. Please, Please don't tease us with saying that the next continuining book will be released (my hardcover edition says in late 1996) and then not deliver. I have even contacted many of the larger chain bookstores and they do list the second book as coming out in print but that it is currently out of print and they suggested a used book store. The used stores also looked up the book and they too said the same thing. WHERE IS THIS BOOK? I have yet to see it anywhere. That is about my ONLY real criticism of this book."
1,Insipid plot with page turning effect,"Just like watching a train wreck, I couldn't help but to finish reading this book. I read and enjoyed the RAMA books--more so earlier in the series before Gentry Lee really added TOO MUCH to the stories. By the end of this book I was really tired of ""Sister Bea"". She should have been named Sister Perfect. The characters were shallow despite the mountains of dialogue that was spewed. I found the book easy to read but I found little to no connection with the characters as they were 2D. Sister Beatrice was extremely annoying. When I completed reading this book, I was happy. No more Sister Bea."
1,Grossly Disappointing,"Take all the best parts of this book and you end up with a c-grade short story, at best. Character development is 2-stars, sci-fi development is 1-star. Saddest of all, given the fact that Gentry Lee was so intimately involved in the Rama series, he absolutely dropped the ball. This was, without reservation, one of the worst books I have ever encountered."
2,"Some science, much sentiment","Gentry Lee's effort sans Clarke shows him to be an engineer, but not a craftsman, of the novel. While his assessment of 22nd century conditions on Earth and Mars is plausible, his characters lack depth and tend toward the 2-dimensional. Johann is undisguised in his representation of the secular analytic, and Beatrice is transparent in her role as mystic. While all good science fiction consists of mysticism and empiricism, the best sci-fi characterizations remain all-too-human mixes of both. Moreover, the plot meanders, leaving many loose threads--one might suppose this to be the invitation to a sequel. Unfortunately, the Bright Messengers sequel threatens to bog down in ungainly descriptions of alien ""snowmen"" and aquatic children whose presence is never explained. Aficionados of Donaldson, LeGuin, Simmons, or Herbert can leave this novel alone."
2,Has a great start and then goes down hill from there.,"The story was interesting enough for me to read it about a day, but I started losing interest when they ended up on the island. The end is strange to say the least. I have been looking all over for the sequel ""Double Full Moon Night"" that was supposed to be out in 1996, then in the spring of 1998. I will have forgotten what the first book was about by the time the sequel comes out."
3,Lukewarm response,"Like everyone else, I picked up this book because I enjoyed the Rama series and wanted to see what Gentry Lee could do on his own. On the whole, I was a bit disappointed. I did enjoy the characters; they seemed like interesting people. I was very disappointed, however, that we never saw what happened to Vivien et al after our protagonists split from the larger group. The plot also left a bit to be desired. Instead of flowing smoothly like the Rama series, it seemed highly constructed. Similarly, quite a bit of the dialogue sounded too much like characters in a book and too little like real people for my tastes.In sum, it was an okay read, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who wasn't already involved with the Rama universe."
3,1st half: Engaging; 2nd half: Head Scratching,"The first half of this book was very entertaining. It was so interesting that i read until i was bleary eyed. I picked up the book because at the end of the Rama series there was an excerpt from Bright Messengers, which I really enjoyed. Once Johann and Sister B started their escapades on the river I felt the book fell apart. It just didn't work. What's with Sister B? After the Yasin episode she suddenly thinks it's ""okay"" to ___? I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it. Head scratching ending.I got to the end and all I could think was ""that's the end?"" I will read the sequel just because I want to find out what happens. Perhaps the writing will be a little more focused and less verbose (unlike my review)."
4,An excellent story based in true humanity.,"It's 1998, it's been two years since I read Bright Messengers, and it seems that there are a lot of people out there who share the exact same feelings as I do---""Where is the sequel"" was said in nine out of ten reviews. I'm glad I wasn't the only one bothering bookstore clerks every time I went into a store. Anyone who loved Rama would like this story. Mr. Lee has a nack for finding the true essence of science fiction--not warp drives and the tenth dimension, but what people DO with warp drives and the tenth dimension. Any good sci-fi story--or any story, for that matter--is based on human condition, and Mr. Lee is an excellent ""Overlord"" for the Rama world. Well done."
4,Beautiful!!,"I really enjoyed this one! It was like following a very intense, beautiful dream. BUT WHERE IS""DOUBLE FULL MOON NIGHT?!!!"
2,Terra Toscana Dinner Plates,"I bought this dinnerware because it has square plates. It also has a very cheerful pattern. There are 4 vegetables and colors incorporated into the design of each ""setting"": eggplant, artichoke, tomato and pepper; light purple, green, red and yellow. The dinnerplate looks like a huge picture frame surrounding the food so it looks like a still life. All the pieces are heavy and hold very generous portions. I can see gaining weight with this pattern.However, the reason I am having a hard time giving this pattern a high rating is the dishes chip so very easily. So badly that I am returning all my pieces. I treat my dishes very carefully, but I have had my set only a month and 3 pieces are chipped. This saddens me."
1,don't waste your money,"These started chipping within a few months, even though I am the only one using them and I was very careful with them. You are better off spending your money on a better product.Very poor quality....."
3,Does not has the range,It work ok if you have a short range to the bell itself. After 40 feet or so the unit does not detect the bell. So make sure your range is under40 feet or so.
2,LED Door Bell Button,The distance Is terrible!! you have to have the button within 30 ft for It to work! It says It will work up to 150 No way!!
1,Range Sucks,I have two Heath Zenith door chimes wired to my front door with know issues. I have a gate at the end of my drive way less than 150 feet from the chimes inside the house. So based on the specs of this unit it should work fine right...wrong. I could not get this thing to work more than 10 feet from the chimes inside the house. I only purchase this product because I couldn't find any other remote push button that would match the chimes I have. I would return the item but it would cost me more to send it back than I paid for the product. So into the trash it goes!
4,Perfect for the basics,I have only used it a couple times for voltage and resistance. Instructions are easy to understand and digital readout is nice.
5,Very nice kit at a super price,"I bought this kit to replace my old multi-meter and circuit tester that were destroyed by Super storm Sandy. This is a great kit. I can't speak about it's longevity, but all three pieces function as designed. There are individual instruction booklets / pamphlets for each piece. The fact that there are batteries and a nylon case included make this a super value in my opinion. Speaking as a homeowner, I highly recommend this kit."
5,voltage meter,good product to have for any electrical work in and around the house where you need to troubleshoot electrical problems
2,Buy the kit in a bind - but avoid if your serious about testing,"Today, any product that does NOT have an auto-shut-off (save the battery) feature is passé (junk - history). I bought the kit in a bind over the holidays to fix an expensive to-be-gift when all product support teams were also on holiday. The other items in the kit with non-moving parts do as well as the higher end brand, but the meter is awful. I bought a FLUKE in the 1980's, still have it, never died, accurate as industry, and today cost one third of what I paid for same model back then! Spend twice as much, get the FLUKE equivalent, pass it to your grandkids, and be happy. The cost of this item in terms of frustration is too high. Spend more and save your wits."
4,Great Tool!,"Bought this as of gift for our contractor and he was ecstatic! It's one of those tools you wouldn't necessarily buy for yourself, but would use it often if you had it."
2,its ok,"those who know sifu Chu will be interested in this very simple explanation for beginners tai chi. Others may wish to keep looking. I feel the book is like how Mr. Chu is described, He doesn't say much"
2,does not really smell,does not really smell unless you stick your nose close to it. I has been in our small bathroom but I have not smelled it whatsoever. a wasted $1... : )
2,We barely notice the smell,"We got a pair of this on sale from a local supermarket and we thought it was a god deal. We put one it the powder room and one in our living room. To make it work, you have to open it partially to let the fragrance comes off. I do like the citrus smell, it was nice the first time I opened it. After a few hours we notice that we don't really smell it around 6 ft away, so we opened it up a little bit more.We used then for a week but we barely notice the smell. Looking inside I noticed that there is just a very small amount left; only around 80% of the solid gel-like freshener is there. Not really happy with this purchase."
4,"Great smell, hard to open","Really nice smell and can last about 2+weeks if left open and used continuously. I use this in my living room and bathroom. Sometimes the smell is a little strong so I close the lid halfway or leave it 1/4th open.One BIG con, in my opinion, is that the design of the plastic is hard to open. It requires you to rotate the top smooth plastic and pull up. For whatever reason, my hands are usually slippery, therefore I have a hard time pulling out the top smooth plastic. I find myself having to get a fork and digging underneath the top plastic to pull it up. I find this very annoying. They should include a small little plastic/metal handle on the very top of the cone, or etch some grooves into the top smooth plastic so you can get a grip on it."
4,"Good, but Not the Best Live Jimi","A good live set, but the audience sounds very uninspired. A pity they can't match the band's energy."
5,Wonderful,"My parents still live in the Ozarks, and I recognised some of the things that were common superstitions, phrases, etc.I found it very entertaining to read, and being born in MO myself, and having lived in some of those areas on and off, made it even more enlightening.I also noticed tiny hints here and there of the Scottish influence, as that is my ancestry, and something I spend much time studying. Many did settle in the hills around there when they came, preferring that over cities. Makes it even more intriguing, that some bits peek out, mingled and changed with the new culture.Good stuff!"
4,Good buy,"I got two storage units for my kids' toys and they do contain a lot. Easy to assemble. Easy to use every night to put the toys back in their place. I wish that the colors of the bins would be more adult looking (navy blue or brown for example), and only one color, to look better in our living room."
5,Great Product!!!!!,I have two of these in my son's room. They are perfect for organizing toys and a perfect size. Would definitely buy again!
1,Very Disappointed!,"This is a unappealing and very cheaply made product. As another reviewer noted, the edges are way to sharp for young children to play with and there were plastic shards that fell off the buckets..."
3,toy bin,This toy bin is good. I think my kids enjoy playing in the bucket and climbing on the rack more than we use it to store toys.
3,"Good story and teen age girl's perspective of ""BIG EVENT""","You can tell that this is the same author as Water Witches --- a female oriented environment in small town New England, written by a man (not quite as much as a stretch as Memoirs of a Geisha --- but better than Dirty Dozen). It is a teen-ager saying ""Something big happened to our family, and let me tell you about it, but before I do, here is some background on our family"". There is a back and forth between the past, present and future which is well handled. Well written and edited. It made me want to reach for the next book by this author."
3,"One for your library card, not your Master card.","This book was thought provoking and I liked that part about the midwife's tale. I felt the ending was entertaining, but completely out-of-character for a healer-type woman to do. She saves her own precious hide in court and then loses her ""calling"" for midwifery. I did too. Birth in a hospital gals, and don't buy this book. If you are curious about the story, use your library card to take a look-see. If you're like me, you won't be wanting to read through it again. Tedious. Could stand some serious editing."
2,Fizzle,About half way through I found this book so boring I had to force myself to finish to the end. I like the idea of the character trying to do something good and instead doing something terribly wrong but it just devolved into a lackluster courtroom drama.
3,This was good but not great,"I enjoyed this book but didn't think it was excellent. Let me rephrase this, I didn't actually enjoy it (in fact, I found it disturbing) but I did want to continue to the end. The first 50 pages I found repetitive which was a theme throughout the book. I would recommend it, but not one of my all time favorites"
3,Not a bad read if you can stomach the begining,"I was surprised by the ending of the book, and a little concerned. An okay book, thankfully it got better as I read on. Have patience, the book does pick up once things go very wrong with one of the widwife's patients."
4,"Engaging, full of mystery, great characters, a must read...","Great writing, great characters, engaging plot"
4,Haunting depiction of how tragedy affects everyone involved.,"A midwife is charged with murder after performing an emergency C-section on a woman she believes is already dead, in order to save the life of the baby. The story is written from the viewpoint of her young daughter, and neatly captures details of the lifestyle of midwifery and the constant conflict between midwives and the medical community, especially as the story unfolds and people in the surrounding community take sides.Very rarely have I read a book written by a man, from a woman's point of view, that actually works as well as this one does. The story itself is compelling, and it will force you to question your own beliefs about ""safe"" childbirth. I highly recommend reading it, especially if you've been through the experience of birth yourself."
2,No depth,Midwives is very easy to read and would appeal to those who love courtroom dramas like Grisham's stuff. The book lacked emotion on the birthing topic and never developed any of the human relationships. Shallow and disappointing.
3,----High Expectations Turns To Disappointment----,"(...) The book had so much hype, but I just can't find it within the pages. I kept waiting, hoping, expecting it to really get interesting. I must admit, I am surprised at the ending so I am glad I didn't put it down unfinished.Characters, esp. Sybil were not developed very well & it just didn't have much depth to it. Maybe it could've been better had the author changed the writing style?Still pondering on this book, wondering if I missed some shooting star that all these other 4 and 5 star raters seemed to have seen.(Three stars because the ending surpised me.) I originally thought 2.5."
3,Hard to describe....,"what I really felt about this book. It was slow moving for me, but it kept pulling me forward.I had a hard time associated that the author was a man, but the narrator was a woman looking back on her twelth year when her mother was put on trial for the ""murder"" of one of her patients. However, the author provided vivid details and wonderful descriptions about the weather in the Vermont countryside and what occurred on the fateful night that made a mid-wife perform a C-section. Extremely graphic, but amazing description of the C-section made me invision everything.But all the wonderful descriptions could not replace that the book was slow reading. I had shared this book with several others and they all expressed the same feelings."
5,Oprah! My Hero?,"I have to admit when my mom bought me this book, I didn't really want to read it. I will also admit that the only reason I started reading the book was that my mom kept nagging me to read it. After I finally did pick up this book about a midwife accused of negligent homicide I was hooked. Where has Chris Bohjalian been hiding? He wrote one of the best fictional trial descriptions I have ever read. In addition, the plot twists and using the daughter of the defendant as the narrator of the story were very well done. I have nothing but praise for this novel. Who knows, I might even start watching Oprah every now and then."
3,Hated it,"I hated it, and so did every other midwife I know who's read this book. I happen to be a Certified Nurse-Midwife, but unlike the snotty CNM-in-a-suit portrayed briefly in Midwives, I have been a homebirth midwife and am very comfortable with it. I was offended by the tone of Sibyl's journal entries (flaky), which I found did not match the character as portrayed. And the ending was cheap and gratuitous."
5,Page turner,"I just finished reading Midwives yesterday and I miss the characters already! The character development was powerful. The reader inevitably makes the Danforth family his/her own. The reader comes to understand Sybil Danforth, a midwife who grew up in the 60's and her feelings during her trial. You develop an affinity for her free spirited self and her love of people and you feel her pain as she is questioned about the death of a woman on whom she performed an emergency c-section. Bohjalian did a wonderful job telling this story through the eyes of Sybil's teenage daughter, Connie. We learn about Connie's feelings about her mother's ordeal as well as the difficulties and pleasures of growing up in a family that advocates acceptance.I enjoyed every minute of reading and I looked forward to having quiet time so I could bve reunited with ""my"" Danforth family."
2,Sloppy writing; interesting topic,"The long, convoluted sentences detract from tight storytelling. The comparisons to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD are especially offensive. I kept reading out of sheer determination, and at times the narrator's tone and personality grew on me . . . But I never quite bought into the reality of the situation. I'm in the minority here, but I think this book is overrated."
5,A novel for any and everyone!,"This book has a timeless and capturing story. It's amazingly mesmerizing and just, an excellent read. The story moves quickly but not to the point where things aren't very detailed because that's hardly a problem here. He, Chris Bohjalian, describes things almost magickal with his vast vocabulary and vivid imagination. The characters in this book will truly touch your heart and give you those warm feelings of love and compassion you'd feel for the characters in book classics. This book is beyond thrilling, it's amazing. A MUST buy for anyone who's picked up a book!"
3,Disappointing,"Perhaps if I hadn't read all the hype about this book, I would have been more charitable. Sure, it was well-written, but I found it really lacked suspense. Started off well, and then dragged. Certainly was not a ""page-turner"" (as a quote on the cover claimed)."
3,It was okay,"I just finished the book yesterday and I didn't immediately want to force someone to read it. It was a good story and the end had a little twist. Not remarkable in my opinon, but ok for a read and I learned some things about midwifery. If you have it laying around or if someone has it to loan you....go ahead, but as far as buying the book and expecting greatness...maybe not."
4,A Good Solid Read,"Midwives is an engaging, solid read. It's court room, suspense novel, told in an interesting, and realistic way. One of the problems I have with a lot of legal thrillers is that they are completely unrealistic, but this one is completely believable, well-written. Bohjalian has you wondering right up until the end as to what the verdict is going to be--was she guilty of murder, of anything? The story of Sybil, a midwife accused of murder when a homebirth goes horribly, horribly wrong is told from the vantage point of her daughter who was a young girl at the time, but is now a practicing Obstetrician. This is the sort of novel that's best if you can just zip right through it--perfect reading for a vacation, or a weekend away. The characters are interesting and believable and certain things happen at the end that will surprise you. It's definitely one of the better Oprah picks."
5,One of the better recommended books I have read lately,"This book is imaginative and interesting. The story was a definite page turner and after reading many books recommended from the NY Times bestseller and Oprah's book Club lists, this is one of the most enjoyable ones, respectively. Even though there were some moments, particularly the C-section depiction, that was a bit graphic and troubled my stomach, it was a very important part of the book that made it gripping and seem more vivid and real. It's an easy read and well worth it. Although this book may not be a book for everyone, it is for MANY and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Very emotional,This book brings excitement and emotion. It shows the hardships of being a midwife in the world some years ago. I enjoyed the book and thought it to be one of the best I have read. I recommend it to women across the country.
3,"Interesting, but not convincing","Midwives was an interesting book, but I was never convinced that the story was being told from a teenage girl's point of view."
3,Rather uneven.,"I found MIDWIVES faded in and out like bad reception on a radio. There are too many riveting books out this summer for me to have patience with uneven quality. I set MIDWIVES aside about halfway through and read THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, the other book I ordered last week from Amazon. It was a page-turner from start to finish, a truly wonderful novel, something Midwives could have been with a little more attention to plot development and characterization."
2,Disappointed,"The story started out very well but it drags on quite a bit with the trial. Adding the journal logs in with the story was a nice touch - gave different perspectives. Was left hanging with the ending - it felt like something was missing, left out. The author has some good sections describing the midwife's emotions and confusion."
4,One of my favorites,"Full of drama and mystery. A believable story and filled with characters you will cherish, question and support. If you like Anne Quindand you will like this book. Can't wait to see more from this author"
3,Not the ending I would like,This is a good fiction story with believable characters and plot. I just really felt let down at the end
4,Good read,Liked this book. Very interesting and suspenseful. I especially liked the trial parts. I would recommend it to all adult readers.
3,"a good, easy read, but nothing special","The midwife drama from the perspective of a 14-year-old daughter was an interesting one; however, several aspects of the story were either unnecessary, like the attraction between the attorney and the midwife, or underdeveloped, like why the teenager became a physician, and how she felt about some of the decisions she made. I would try this author again, but I won't go seeking her out for more just yet."
4,Male acceptance,"froma guy point of view, i was truly engaged with this novel. From the begining with the word ""Vulva"" i was stuck ready. Sometimes it may be difficult for a male to sit back and enjoy the details of a C-section when giving birth. this novel was a Drama intangled by a tragedy. through the eyes of young Sibyl, this is a mystery amongst all others. the guy with too much testosterone, probably wouldnt be able to enjoy the book for the subject. good thing for me i'm not that guy"
4,Grants reader an emotional and educational new perspective!,"Midwives is a book that is not only suspenseful and emotional, but also humorous and enlightening. I was very impressed by the manner in which Bohjalian delt with the tender and sensitive issues of life, death, pregnancy, birth, and family. How anyone could say that Bohjalian is anti-Midwifery is beyond me. Sybil Danforth is brilliant--and human--and is portrayed as such. Oh, yes! The ending was very surprising! Not the typical, predictable read. The daughter, Connie, offers a fresh and, at times, funny narrative that has made me rethink all of my formerly conceived notions on home-birthing and midwifery and I'm pleased by the extent of which I have been intellectual and emotionally engaged by this book."
4,A worthwhile read,"This is one of the best Oprah picks in a long time. I really felt the pain that the daughter went throught and the mother's torment and confusion. My only complaint was that here was a woman who cannot honestly say that didn't kill another woman due to her own mistake and yet returns to her career as a midwife. I think if I knew that I might be responsible for another's death in this way, that I could never go back to my career."
3,interesting story exploring medicine and midwifery,"Became interested in reading this book through my wandering through amazon's ""bookshelves"" After successfully negotiating it as a present for Xmas I have now finished reading it. I found it did cover an area I was aready interested in...the historical context of birth and midwifery which was covered in a book I read recently called ""Birth options"" by an English couple. The case outlined in the book teased out some of the background to the uneasieness between medicine and midwifery which is possibly the uneasiness between male and female care of the labouring woman. It explored the popular notion of labour as a medical condition...In all however it wan't as ""meaty"" as I had expected, seeming to explore these topics on a superficial level only...possibly because it is narrated from a 14 year old girl's perspective."
5,thrilling,I haven't read a book I couldn't put down for awhile. I never knew what the outcome would be until the actual finish. The narration done by the daughter as well as Sybil's diary immeresed you in the story. I'll be looking for this author again.
2,uncomfortable,"Of the 10 books I have just read in the last 3 months, this is one I won't be passing along to mom. I got extremely ucfomfortable reading this book since my daughter was due to give birth any moment. I thought she was stupid to even think about not having an emergency plan for all her moms. Too much can happen giving birth in the 21st century to let some lady deliver your baby in your bed at home. We all had c-sections due to pre-eclampsia in our family. Anyway who wants to read about babies dying? I certainly don't."
5,Excellent and quick service!,"I but this book as used (excellent conditions) and it really was, I also got it very fast!"
1,Yawn and yawn again!,"The first Bohjalian book I read was ""Double Bind"" and both my husband and other family members thoroughly enjoyed it. It held our interest from page one and maintained a keen level of suspense with a truly WOW ending. So when I was lent ""Midwives"" I thought it might be an interesting story and probably a quick read considering its size. WRONG! This book reminded me of all those women who must tell you every detail of their deliveries whether you care to know or not. I had no trouble envisioning all those weepy-eyed souls who groove on this smaltz. Don't waste your time on this book but DO make the effort to read ""Double Bind"" which is Chris Bohjalian's redeeming novel."
2,Any day now....,"This book was extremely hard to read. It was NOT a page-turner by any means. I found this book very dry. If it wasn't for the shocking ending I would have rated it a big fat zero. It didn't pick up until the very last chapter which to me was frustrating. If you like court room stories, this book is for you."
2,Midwives let me down,"The story in this book was very good, but I don't think it was written very well. It seemed to take a very long time to get to the point, and then it just seemed to hang there. It took me about a month to read but I finally finished it. Overall, I was very disappointed in this book after reading all of the rave reviews."
5,Captivating,I was sketchy on the subject matter of the book but the story is so well told and detailed it sucked me right in. You get to know the characters and really feel for them. The ending blew me away
3,was kindof hard to finish,I thought this book was ok...just ok. I put it down several times and had to make myself finish it. The story was really good it was a little too slow for my tastes.
3,It was a dark and stormy night...,"This book revolves around the life of Sybil Danforth who is a midwife in Vermont. On a stormy night she is called to deliver Charlotte Bedford's baby. It is a night that will forever change the lives of Sybil and her family because she is charged with involuntary manslaughter. The story of this event, its aftermath and the impact it makes on so many lives is told through the eyes of Sybil's daughter and through the pages of Sybil's journal.I found the story to be incredibly well written and suspenseful. I liked the last line of the book..it indeed makes you think."
5,replaced To Kill A Mockingbird as my favorite courtroom book,"Not having been a fan of most of Oprah's previous choices of books (too many women in turmoil and crisis) this one makes up for all the others.The characters were written in such a way that it is hard to decide which one is my favorite. They are all beautifully, humanly and intensely described and I would love to know any one of them.I felt like I was in the middle of the courtroom drama and suspense and read with much anticipation as to the outcome."
3,Too simplistic to be a five star review,"I was very disappointed with this novel. I am looking for five star terrific novels from Oprah's Book Club. Although this novel was a ""quick read"" the conclusion of the novel was known little more than half way through. I felt that it was a short story that had been lengthened into a novel. C'mon Oprah, you can do better than this."
3,"This is a good, thought-provoking read.","I enjoyed this book. The first person point of view is perfect. Connie is a very mature narrator who seems to be asked to handle an extremely scary series of events with the most emotional support coming from a teenage boyfriend. It seems that Sibyl who becomes so involved with the lives of others should be more aware of the needs of a young daughter. Bohjalian makes all the characters very realistic. Sibyl seems to be a strong woman who often focuses on what she wants to do and what is best for her. She doesn't seem to think about how the trial and her actions affect Connie's mental health. To the very end of the book, I have the feeling that Sibyl in many ways came to grips with the death of Charlotte more easily than Connie did. This book shows how actions of those close to us affect our own actions and values. I see more about the handling of stressful situations by individuals than I do about the question of giving birth at home or in a hospital setting."
3,"Forget the sleeping pills, read Midwives.",I thought midwives was a very good book but everytime I picked it up I began to nod off. Suffice to say it took me a while to read it. The novel is very poignant and well written. You develop a deep sympathy for the characters throughout the novel. This is a book every woman should read but I'm not sure how well men would enjoy it. Besure to drink a pot of coffee before tackling this novel or you will be out before the first paragraph is done. Good Night.
3,This is an Oprah book?,"I couldn't get over the fact that the author was writing from a female prospective. It is a well written book but as a man I'm not sure if he was able to grasp what a woman would have felt in the same situation. The ending is what surprised me. Listening to Oprah and the women talk on the show made me feel as though this was a noble look at midwifery as a profession. That's not what I got from the ending. Like I said, it is a well written book but hardly what I was expecting."
2,What Midwife...,"Obviously this author does not know much about anatomy or midwifery. Although many have found him the expert he takes birth, the midwife's role and what her scope of practice is out of context.My advice would be talk to a midwife..."
1,slooooooooow,"I found it very hard to proceed through this rambling repetitive story. A good editor could have had a field day with this book. I am glad I got to the last page, though. It provided a surprise ending. But the pain and suffering to finish it was not worth the wait."
2,hmmmm,Just unbelievable!I don't think the main character would do this. The characters are interesting but very conventional in their description. Dunno. Not so hot all round
3,A decent read,"I was a little surprised at the ending of this book. It was an o.k. read, but having just read Anderson Cooper's book, this book had a huge standard to live up to"
1,"See Chris write. Write, Chris, write!","This was my first foray into the esteemed world of Okra's Book Club -- courtesy of my public library. I grabbed the well-worn copy, as the subject of midwifery is compelling. Alas, what a disappointment! This book is written at probably a 4th grade level, and it grieves me to think of how many women found this to be a stimulating read. I saw a recent article about the coming demise of Okra's Book Club, and it noted that the club ""had people reading again."" I would suggest that the people this collection appeals to should start with Hooked on Phonics. Or Dick and Jane."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Three major cons:1. Connie's narrative style became annoying right after page 2. She is verbose, erudite and waffles too much when making a point. As Connie is the main voice in the book, this really spoiled it for me.2. Sybil and her New-Age take on life, her (ab)use of words like ""magical"" and ""energy"".3. My own squeamishness when it came to vivid descriptions of the births, procedures, etc.The most enjoyable things in the book are the brief descriptions of Vermont. Wish he had included more."
2,"Sure, it's entertaining","I read it in one sitting and was entertained. But I can also go the movies and in less time get the same amount from a film. If you want an entertaining book to read while working out at the gym - this is a decent choice. If you want something that changes the way you look at the world - or yourself, then this is not it. It's not at all original and the characters and the plot are superficial."
3,Had a sense of discomfort with this book,"The book reads along easily enough, but I felt so uncomfortable with this sad topic that I couldhardly wait until I finished the book. Didn't care if she was found guilty or not, justlet's get this over with."
5,A Pleasant Page Turner!,"This book was a pleasant surprise for me. I had never read anything by Bohjalian before and just picked it up on the way to the airport for a long flight. This book made that flight seem like a 5 minute trip to the 7-11!The book is written from the point of view of Connie, a 13 year old whose mother, Sybil, is a midwife. Sybil performs a birth that has major complications which land her in court.This book looks at the human side of the story, while still keeping the legalities of the trial part of the plot. It makes for an interesting read.I HIGHLY recommend this book. I read it for the first time a few years ago, and I'm presently enjoying it for a second time! I believe it would be a great beach read, too!"
2,Tedious,"""Midwives"" is terribly over-rated. I found ""I Know This Much is True, ""The Triumph and the Glory"", and ""Mother Of Pearl"" far more enjoyable. They each conveyed a sense of wonder, offered captivating characters, and were blessed with plots worthy of bestsellers, unlike Midwives, which just drifted rudderless until it happened to hit something, then drifted anew."
3,Disservice to the profession,"On Jan 18th, a judge wrote a review on here called ""a good book with an unsettling ending"". His or her comments regarding Sybils' lack of training reflect the unfortunate results of reading a book like this and pronouncing biased and unfair judgement upon a subject without first researching properly all the real information. I hope that any midwives in a similar situation do not end up with this judge! He / she also comments that they would not allow nursing to go on in a courtroom! People like this are running the country! I had my baby at home with and excellent pre natal care from a midwife, and a couple of check ups from a doctor, recommended by my midwife . I feel that this book gives a bad image to midwives, and is very open to unfavourable projections onto the profession."
2,"It could have been good, but...",The idea for the storyline is good. It could have captivated a wide audience of women. The sorry aspect of the book that ruined it for me is the point of view from which the story is told: the daughter of the midwife. There are so many details which are key to the legal case and to the main character's development as a person that the daughter could never have observed or understood. This unbelievable piece was distracting throughout the entire book. I'm waiting for the tv movie version...it will be better.
2,Not terrible - but certainly not worth the hype!,"I was quite disappointed. The story meandered and dragged with no apparent direction and the daughter sometimes irritated with her dramatisation of the most inconsequential events. If you read every 3rd chapter and the final one of course, you would probably enjoy the book much more!"
1,Contemptuous and one-sided,"Apparently writing about a subject such as birth from the point of view of a fourteen year old girl is too much of a stretch for this male author. It seems like he started from the point of view that home birth is an incredibly stupid idea, tried to play devils advocate, and failed to create an even remotely sympathetic cast of characters.He portrays women who decide to have home births as uneducated, hippie, misinformed women instead of the truth that many educated and compassionate women choose to have home births. His statistics and information are inaccurate (for example, that only lay midwives perform home births today, which simply isn't true in many states).His unimaginative writing style is also lacking. He doesn't trust his reader to remember an event that happened twenty pages prior, like restating the fact that the trial was difficult for the family, which is obvious. All in all, disappointing and irritating."
5,Captivating story that holds your interest until the end.,"This is the first novel I've read by Chris Bohjalian; it was not a disappointment. The involuntary manslaughter criminal trial of a nurturing midwife (Sybil Danforth) is told from the perspective of her now adult daughter (Connie Danforth), who was 13 at the time the trial takes place. The story line was realistic and entirely believable, which drew the reader into the story quickly. The retrospective point of view of the grown daughter telling the story through her eyes as a 13 year old child was an interesting way for the story to unfold. The ending was bittersweet, and there clearly were no real ""winners"" at the book's conclusion. It's a quick read that I would be great for a bookclub discussion."
3,Thought provoking,"While it took me longer than usual to finish this one, I was very glad I did. The author did a wonderful job portraying the scene of the pivotal birth, and the method he uses to describe the trial kept me guessing about the verdict. The ending was haunting and made it all worthwhile."
2,great story idea botched by trite writing,"Where to start? A midwife attended my son's birth, so I read a friend's copy. The writing was on the level of a talented high school student. Silly courtroom scenes, characters that were both unlikeable and uninteresting, stilted story structure. All in all, something that you might be forced to read while trapped in an airport or a cabin with no real books. I felt the author was condescending to us, perhaps holding back for a real book. From what I can tell, no real midwife would practice the way Sibyl did. The conflict between the obstetrical world and the world of midwifery was so trite. The world could use a great novel with home birth(s) as a plot device, but this one sure ain't it."
1,"The word ""boring"" comes to mind.",I can't believe this book has received so much positive press......especially with Oprah. I found the characters to be dull and flat. I had to make myself finish this book just so I couldn't be called a quitter. I just couldn't become interested in the silly plot and thought the whole book could have been written in 4 to 5 pages. It's back to Mary Higgins Clark for me!
1,This book is horrible,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author has a stereotype for everyone instead of creative thoughts of his own. The midwife clearly killed her patient but the midwife and her daughter showed absolutely no moral fiber when they both tried to deliberately conceal this fact. It amazes me that the author would treat this fact so casually.As fas as the plot goes, there was no suspence throughout the book. It was like reading a newspaper article at times. The author reveals 90% of the book in the first chapter so I could have saved myself considerable time by just reading the 1st and last chapters of this book.The journal entries to start each chapter were horrible. It seemed too obvious that they were written by a man trying to write like a woman. Come on, I need something that important to have some credibility.Oprah, you could have done better. A good book to discuss, perhaps, but not a good read."
5,10 years later,"If you haven't read this book yet and are contemplating it--take the plunge and dive in this book.I read it nearly ten years ago and still felt compelled to throw my hat in the ring in favor of this book.It was an easy read and before you know it you're hooked and can't stop drinking until you pass out. Then you wake up the next day still hung over from the reading the night before and the only cure is ""hair of the dog""."
3,Kelly's English Review,"This book is a devastating story about a tragic event in a midwives life. One little mistake can cause a lifetime of pain. For Sybil and her family, living with this mistake was one of the hardest things to do. In this book I especially liked the excerpts from Sybil's diary which portray her pain and suffering. They also help you to get to know Sybil's thoughts on her career, daughter, trial and life. Her trial was long and hard. It amazed me that the author of this book was male. He portrayed a young girl so well, the way that I thought only a woman could do."
1,slooooooow,"A good editor might have been able to tighten up and improve this story. The telling was slow moving, and I found it difficult to stay focused on the tale. Stubbornly, I held on until the end when a surprise ending completed the book. It was not enough of a surprise to make it worthwhile reading."
1,Amateurish drivel,"I was appalled that this book has been compared to To Kill a Mockingbird...it is not in anywhere near the same league as such a classic. Granted the story is an interesting one, but it's a shame it was written so poorly. This novel is trite, corny and unrealistic, the dialogue is inane and immature, the characters are undeveloped, uninteresting and not particularly likable (Connie is nothing but cliches) and the author seems to have a limited vocabulary. It's just not very intelligent. Obviously I'm in the minority here but this book was such a disappointment I am completely bewildered by all the praise."
4,A High-Minded Legal Thriller,"Chris Bohjalian is a very talented writer, but not in an obvious or flashy way. I was most impressed by his seamless handling of time-shifts in this complex narrative. He also did an excellent job at creating suspense. I suspect, though, that he meant for the book to be more a 'novel of ideas' than a novel of suspense. In that respect, I found it similar to ""Snow Falling On Cedars"": great storytelling, but not great literature."
4,"Gripping story, stays with you for a long time","I enjoyed this book but occasionally found it hard to read -- it is a powerfully told story, very emotionally exhausting. Connie, the teenage daughter from whose point of view the story unfolds, never came alive for me. I found myself looking forward to the chapter introductions when we could ""hear"" Sibyl's (the midwife's) voice -- she was by far the most vibrant character, and I wish the author had given us more of her. As it is, the few indirect glimpses we see are enough to make us sympathize with her and want her to be the moral victor in the case. Overall, I rate this book very highly, but it is, as I say, a haunting story and occasionally, I found myself wincing as I read on."
3,This book was a good read,"I bought this book because I had heard Oprah and others recommend it so. Usually I read a book in a day or two , this took me two weeks. It took me a long time to get into it! read it while on Holiday!"
4,"Entertaining, very well written...","This book is gripping. You will want to hurry through the end... It shows how a mistake (maybe) can torment you for a long time... The characters are very human, dealing with a life and death decision that keeps haunting them. I recommend it."
5,Great Drama!,"I really enjoyed this book. The description on the cover is right - you will stay up very late in order to finish it. The story told from the perspective of the daughter works well, and the story moves along, taking you right with it. I thought the best part was the last page - but don't peek!"
4,Captivating and entertaining.,"Midwives is an excellent novel. Easy to read, yet written with explicit detailed descriptions that bring to life every moment. Also, I think the midwives are a very controversial issue worth reading about."
3,Average,"Not a great book, but not a waste of time either. I agree with another reviewer that it was ""uneven""."
4,Midwives,"Good book with good detail. If you are squeamish, this might not be the book for you. I would have liked to hear some of the husbands point of view."
3,Missed the mark.,Everything in this novel including characters as well as subject matter was handled on a superficial basis. Was this a first novel for the author?
3,A Good book but could of been better,The beginning of the book was slow but it got better as you went along. It kept you going wondering what the outcome would be at the end of the trial. The best part of the book was the last page--don't peak!
5,"This novel was a rare jewel of ""Recent Popular Literature""","I really enjoyed this novel. As an English major I rarely get a chance to read ""Recent Popular Literature"" and on the rare occasion that I do, I am usually sorely dissapointed. The comparision between the narration in Midwives to that of To Kill a Mockingbird intrigued me and I was truly delighted to find that this mysterious and well-crafted novel did bare a resemblance to my favorite childhood book. I was so enamored with Bohjalian's novel that I did not want to finish it for fear that I would not find a comprable likeness for some time. I did finish it, reluctantly, but I will avoid reading any of his other novels in hopes that his elevated status will not be shattered in my very elitist view of great authors. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read it!"
4,Great book!,"I read this book by accident. I was on my way home from a conference and had nothing to read during my 7 hour trip home so I bought a book in the airport. I chose this book because it looked more interesting than the others, not because I'd heard anything about it or because it sounded especially interesting. I loved it. I didn't expect much when I purchased it but I'm sure glad that I did. I would recommend it highly."
3,Worth the read,This was not a book that I couldn't put down. The labor room scenes were too taxing to take a lot of...I'm sure the mother's would have put them on hold if they could. But I found the charactors to be real...I wondered where the counter-culture 60's people had gone. Connie was perfect as the eavesdropping teen. Watch any conversation you have if there is a teen with in twenty miles. I would like to read more from this writer.
4,The ending will make you question what you think you know.,"Originally from Burlington, VT, I enjoyed the setting and description in Midwives, especially after reading Bohjalian's newspaper columns for years. While I think the book delves too deeply into the courtroom drama, guiding the reader to conclusions about medical and moral ethics rather than letting them reach them for themselves, the ending truly makes up for any dullness the courtroom chapters add to the book. The characters were well-rounded, with the exception of the daughter's young yet unrealistically mature boyfriend, and draw the reader into their lives, so much so that one can't help but confront his or her own thoughts and feelings on the moral issues at hand, and wonder what he or she would do in the same situation."
3,A bit dissapointed,"I felt the book was a very easy read but a bit too preditable. I knew what was going to be on the last page before I read it. It did not have enough depth for me and I would not recommend it to other people I know to read. It also seemed a bit too drawn out. I, however, did learn a few things about being a midwife."
2,Taped Version of MIDWIVES - Listened to it on Tape,"The taped version of MIDWIVES was well produced. The sound was clear and the actor's reading was quite professional. The book on tape was a bit of a let-down possibly because it was much too abridged. I travel a lot by auto and prefer to hear the entire book rather than a boiled-down version. It was too short, probably leaving out a lot of the emotion, leaving the listener short of the feelings we read books for. I think that if you have time to hear a book on tape, it should be more than a couple of hours long. Otherwise we can see a movie based on a book which also requires editing out a lot of the author's text."
2,ah. pass it over,"the story idea are good, and i liked that the daughter told her version but it just fell short, actually, it was too heartwarming, too depthful...just too too.."
4,Interesting medical-legal thriller,"The story was well-told and gripping with several minor flaws. The characters handled the stress they were under with superhuman nobility. By foreshadowing, the author prepared us for one verdict and then gave us the other. Telling the tale from mother's and daughter's viewpoints was an effective device. The issue was compelling."
4,a good read; impressed with portrayal of female perspective,"I very much enjoyed this book. I was impressed with the male author's ability to very convincingly present a female perspective, and of a 14-year-old female to boot. And I have to admit being somewhat amazed that a man would care enough about midwifery and childbirth to carry out the significant amount of research (never mind writing time) that went into this book. I also liked the pace of the book--I was thoroughly drawn in, but unlike pulp detective stories et al., the writing was sophisticated enough that I *could* put it down when I needed to get on with the rest of life."
2,good idea; poorly executed,"This guy had an original idea for a story, and in the hands of a better writer, this could have been a great book. However, Bohjalian's characters are flat. His prose is metiocre- the dialogue is awkward and forced, and the narrative is in love with its own gravity. What surprises me most is how poorly plotted this book is. We know exactly what happened during the central birth/death before the trial even starts, and we are fed the crucial testimony within the book's first hundred pages. I'm sticking with Harper Lee's ""TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"""
1,Too gynecological,I didn't even come close to finishing this book. I usually finish them all! This book takes every chance to drop gynecological and child birthing terms and sprinkle them liberally throughout in a politically correct approach to story writing that I found manipulative and boring. Boring. Boring. And gross!
2,Midwives,"The story is a great one, which is sad since it was paired with such a boring writer. The speaker of the novel is incredibly boring and flat, as are most of the other characters. It's really too bad that a better writer didn't take this idea and run with it."
2,Not too into this book.,"This book was ok, but I probably would have made a different decision purchasing it. I'm sure some people would enjoy it...it's just not for me."
4,Amazing Voice,"What really impressed me about this book was how well the author, a man, wrote with the voice of a young woman. Though nothing like Connie (I am about the age she was at the time of the trial), I could actually identify with her as a person. Many authors struggle with creating realistic young adult voices, so Bohjalian is clearly very gifted. Reading Midwives, I could hardly believe it wasn't a memoir.While about the midwife and mother's trial, this book seemed to be more of a coming of age story, with elements of a legal story. Though superior, Midwives reminds me of My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult.It was an absorbing read, drama with a very human element.Any quibbles I had with the story mostly came from the fact that I myself am not in favor of home births.Midwives would not be on my list of must-reads, but it is an excellent piece of literature."
2,fell short,"This book fell totally short of all I hoped and dreamed. I don't know if it is because I had such high expectations to read this book. The first few chapters were fine, then the book started to slip my attention span causing me to lose interest."
2,"Lots of potential, but ultimately disappointing","This book had the potential to be a good read - birth and death, court room drama, etc. However, it turned out to be a major disappointment. The daughter as narrator totally failed. I would have rather heard about what was going on in her mother's head than about all that meaningless information about her goofy boyfirend. Don't waste your time with this book."
4,A good read...,"I read Midwives after my mom read most of it, and then stopped reading because she felt she knew what the ending would be. I, on the other hand, can never put down a book without reading the ending, and was pleasantly suprised. I recommend this to anyone who likes the suspense of long trials. Otherwise, it may not be a good choice."
2,Slow-going!,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book and was very intrigued by the developing story. However, I got ""bogged down"" during the very long and drawn out chapters about the pre-trial happenings, jury selection, etc. I still haven't finished this book! Every time I try to pick it up again, I just get frustrated and put it back on the shelf. After reading some of the other reviews, maybe I'll give it one more try."
4,Standing by our convictions...standing by family,This book was very interesting. I felt like I got to know Sybil who is a midwife that truly believes that giving birth is a divine natural process between parents and child. The c-section that lead to her court room drama had me on the edge of my seat and had me torn between my belief in what she felt was right and what should have actually happened. I think Chris did a good job sharing this story through the eyes of Sybil's daughter. The ending is a little shocker. An excellent book with beautiful prose. I look forward to reading Chris' next book.
3,"A fairly interesting read,but does a disservice to midwives.","The premise of this story is interesting, but I agree with a previous reviewer that Midwives gives the reader an inaccurate portrayal of the midwifery profession. I am a practicing midwife, and none of my colleagues would consider taking a kitchen knife to a laboring mother and performing a c-section at home. There are enough misconceptions about midwifery without Mr. Bojhalian's adding fuel to the fire."
5,I loved this book!,"As a reader who likes courtroom dramas and medical sagas, this book had a little bit of everything. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the midwifery field. The cast of characters was full of likeable people. I hated to say goodbye when I finished the book."
5,"""Timeline story-telling"" weaves you into the drama.","I lived this book as I was reading it. Told by the now grown woman who was the 14 year old daughter of the main character at the time of the story, this ""timeline story-telling"" wove me right into the family. ""Midwives"" is a story of tenderness, compassion, morality and human foibles. Though the author is male, he does an excellent job of writing as a female adolescent and female adult. His understanding of the relationship between mother and daughter is surprising and at the same time, he wisely limits that understanding to the clarity it would have from a 14 year old point of view. I was impressed that this male writer did not try to make the men in the story more important than they were to this decidedly womanly tale."
2,"good premise, bad writing","The premise was so interesting that it kept me going to the end, but in spite of the writing rather than because of it. (The first 50 pages are especially weak.) The daughter's narration detracted from the plot and the author's language just kept hitting false notes. I was disappointed that a plot with so much potential was mishandled."
2,a total waste of time,"I think the author did an excellent job of describing a 14 year old's perceptions of a most extraordinary event. It's just that this 14 year old's perspective just wasn't very interesting. I would have much rather heard about this event from an adult point of view although I don't think any of the adults in this book would have had much of anything interesting to say either. I think one point was missed by the prosecution. Midwives always say that home birthing is safe because they always have a backup plan of transport to a hospital if anything goes wrong. Sibyl deprived herself of this option when she chose to try a home birth even though the weatherman predicted a ""nasty"" storm with ""lots of black ice"" and ""extremely hazardous conditions"". Home birthing is not a safe option when there is no safety valve as she so painfully realized much too late."
2,Slow as well as underdeveloped characters.,"I usually love Oprah's suggestions. This however, was not one of the better picks. I felt as though it took forever to get to the body of the book and then the rush ending that followed let me flat."
2,Poor writing hampers interesting plot,"I'm very surrised that Oprah selected Midwives for her book club. I read this book last year on my mother's recommendation, and while the premise was interesting enough, the author's style was often awkward and meandering, giving way to weak, melodramatic passages. The narrator was unreliable, as well as annoying--everytime one of her introductions rolled around, I found myself cringing. I finished the book out of a sense of obligation, but by the end I didn't care what the outcome of the trial was. I wish Oprah would exercise more care in choosing the books for her club--after all, most women in America only read something if she endorses it."
4,Consequences brought to life,"A thoughtful and provocative look at how a home-birth gone wrong leads to a trial and the effects on a family and community. Connie, as narrator, is straightforward and that works with such an intense story. Sibyl, as mother/mid-wive is compelling, You see why she works at a job that modern society deems unnecessary and you go back-and-forth wondering if she's 'guilty' in the criminal sense. That ambiguity is of the author's strengths. No one is 'wrong' or 'evil' but choices do count and lives are intertwined."
1,Bad TV in print,"It was as about as dreadful as the cheapest ""bodice-ripper"" thriller I've ever read/seen. This is television in print; McLuhan would lament our fall to ""chewing gum for the soul"". It lacks the underlying feel for the subject of even ""St. Elsewhere"", which is where I wished I was by the last page. The author is a sensational opportunist, and sadly, the American public, especially women, are fooled. Why would so many women rush to buy so violent a caricature of themselves?"
4,Midwives,"I found this book to be a slow starter and a little hard to get into, yet it turned out to be one of those books you can't quite walk away from either. I found myself continuing to read it just to ""get it over with"", but was lured more and more into the plot with each passing chapter.The writing is superb and one can actually feel oneself feeling the emotions of each character as the story continues. I was surprised to learn the writer was a man though. The feelings and emotions he gives his female characters are very real and could very well mirror those of real women today placed in similiar situations. Women can relate to the characters feelings and feel compassion for them. Chris Bohjalian is to be applauded for his excellent insight and ability to relay that insight to the reader.The ending was well worth the wait and made the entire book worth reading."
2,Not very compelling...hard to finish,"I did not finish this book, although I gave it a fair chance by reading through the first 140 pages or so. The topic of midwifery did peak my interest, which is why I started to read it, but I found it sullen, dragging, and rather depressing."
2,Didn't get interesting,"I found myself bored with this book really quickly. I then found myself to start skimming....I had to force myself to start the book again and really give it a try. I did, and thought the book was boring and not developed. I should have continued to skim it and not waste my time"
2,A slow read...,"I was a bit disappointed in the story. Although it had some high points, I felt that overall it wasn't enough to truly capture my attention. I read the entire story, but found that it took me a long time to get through it. I felt that I never really got to know the characters Connie and Sybil. What I did enjoy were the last few chapters....they were filled with anticipation and surprises. I was happy to finally finish the story."
5,Bohjalian Touches the Midwife's Heart,"As a retired certified nurse-midwife and a published writer, I was prepared NOT to like the premise of this novel. Wow! I was blown away with the author's insight into the heart of a midwife. Having lost my own career due to illness, I know the pain of having to leave a calling that to me and other midwives is almost holy. I cried with Sibyl Danforth. Bravo, Mr. Bohjalian! Three things I can recommend to any reader: 1) an engaging plot, 2) real, three-dimensional characters, and 3) brilliant use of the daughter's voice to tell the story.Also recommended: ""The Midwife's Song"" by Brenda Ray"
2,It wasn't the thrilling novel that Oprah claimed it to be.,I was really disapointed with this book. I thought it was a waste of money and a big waste of my time. I can't believe that Oprah recomended this book to millions of people! Being a Registered Nurse and having a great interest in labor and delivery I thought I would love this one. Truthfully I found it rather stupid and very boring. Chapters 6-20 were all about what happened in chapter 5. Absolutely nothing new or exciting happened until chapter 21! It sure wasn't the thrilling novel that I thought it would be!
5,Midwives is an excellent book. I highly recommend it.,"This was the first time I read anything by this author and I truly loved this novel. Captivating and spell-binding, I read the majority of the book in one sitting. A truly excellent read."
1,Plain and simple BAD!,"I don't understand the positive reviews on this book. I didn't think it was worth my time. I had to force myself to finish it. I wonder if it might be that Oprah recommends the book, she loved it, they should too. I'm able to form my own opinion."
2,NOT a page turner!,"This is an interesting book on some levels (court procedures, medical details, etc) but how can it be a page turner when we know from the start that the mystery can never be solved? It's just frustrating - was the woman dead or alive when the C-section was performed? No, the ""surprise"" ending, doesn't really help. We'll never actually know! Given that, and the inevitability of reasonable doubt, the outcome of the court case is hardly a suspenseful event either. If you are interested in midwifery, read this book, you'll enjoy it. If you are expecting midwifery to be just the backdrop to something more, don't bother. The writing is functional, the characters a bit stereotypical and there are some odd plot points (how can the judge not notice critical dates missing from the diaries? Really!) but I read to the end and was crosser with the misleading reviews (""keep you up all night"", ""like To Kill a Mockingbird"") plastered all over the covers than the book itself."
5,A wonderful book!,"This ia truly remarkable story, beautifully written. I highly recommend this book. The ending is a bit of a twist. I found it astonishing that Chris Bohjalian could write in the first person from the perspective of a young girl. He was spot on!"
2,"so painfully drawn out, couldn't even finish","The book began reasonably well, yet the farther into the book I got the harder it became for me to turn the page, until I finally couldn't force myself to face the pain and boredom brought on by this book. all interest was lost by the fourth chapter and yet I managed to (mind you, only on the velocity provided by the earlier chapters) read though chapter 7. The book gets two stars because it is an intresting & original concept, although poorly executed. read something worthwhile like ""memoirs of a geisha"""
1,I am finding it extremely difficult to complete this book.,"The title of this book is what intrigued me to purchase it. What a disappointment. The characters in this book must be the most boring and mundane people I have ever read about. There is no glimpse at all into what the main character, Sybil, is thinking except for her journal entries at the beginning of each chapter. What a waste of my time and my money."
2,"interesting story, but ...............",while this book was entertaining it was focused on the negatives of midwifery and not the positives. the focus on negative outcomes is contrary to all numbers and studies regarding midwifery. the author would have done midwifery more justice by writing an interesting novel about midwifery that focused on what a safe option it is for women. i don't regret reading it but think i will pause before buying the next book oprah recommends.
3,Lost my attention ...,"I was looking forward to reading this, but it did not hold my attention. Maybe it's just me. I like this author."
2,Midwives: A Novel,"This is a very slow moving book that is hard to keep my attention. While reading it, I find my mind wandering while wishing the plot would quicken and become more thought provoking. Not a book for me but I will finish reading it because I can't stand to leave a book unread."
4,New look at an old profession,"I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about midwivery. I have read several of Bojhalian's books and they are always well researched.This story is told from a the teenaged character's point of view and she does a good job of it. I did get a little bored toward the end and wanted to skip to the end of the book to see how it turned out, but didn't."
4,A thought provoking piece of fiction,"Chris Bohjalian gives us an interesting topic and lots of food for thought in this tightly packed little novel. Midwifery, morals, judgement under fire, lives torn asunder- this book is loaded with things to think about and ponder, not the least of which is how this book ends (what do YOU think really happened?) This was a really neat little book. Serious, maybe too serious for some, but one that continues to haunt me. Particularly interesting to women, I would think, although some men might enjoy this. I think any OB/GYN would find this book fascinating, but that's not to exclude the average reader."
4,Wonderful Read,"On vacation in Hong Kong, I picked up this book at an airport bookstore. Kept me reading and enjoying the story. I enjoyed the way the author moved from past to present. I have passed this book along to others in my family to enjoy."
4,WOW! What a read!,This was a great novel about the strength of a family! I loved reading through Connie's eyes. It wasn't as much of a page turner as I'd expected but what an ending! Bojalian totally takes the reader by suprise and left me wide-eyed for hours after finishing! This novel is full of emotion and Bojalian leaves you unable to forget one detail! This book appeals to all types of readers!
3,Was This a Documentary or a Novel?,"I ask this question because the book doesn't have the depth of character development, suspense, etc. that I expect in a novel. It reminds me more of a good TV docmentary...Facts...Views of the participants. I read the entire book in one afternoon and evening, so it felt like a long docu-drama to me. So much time was spent with the daughter's point-of-view. Much of the detail that, to me, makes a good medical mystery/thriller was absent. I was disappointed in the book. It just wasn't what I expected."
4,Gripping,"I read this book early last year and was unable to put it down until I had read the very last page. Working in the nursing profession I found the medical/legal aspects a little chilling, every nurses nightmare. A perfect read for a cold autumn weekend. Hooray Oprah on your latest choice!"
5,I was hooked from the first chapter - a wonderful book.,"I loved how the story evolved from the perspective of the daughter and also her mothers diary. I felt ""teased"" to read just one more chapter and then another."
4,A real eye-opener!,"Having always though of home-birth as something out of the ordinary, ""Midwives"" and Chris Bohjalian really lent a new perpective to what is a very old and accepted practice. Strongly recommended as a nice book to curl up on the couch with over the Holiday season."
5,Hard to put down!,"Bohjalian's Midwives is impressive in that I was truly able to read this through the eyes of a 14-year old girl! His research must have been horrendous to cover so many fronts so thoroughly...from the birth experience and the whole legal process to the various weavings of the family relationships and experiences. It was a great read, indeed!"
3,Cat Pendant,My wife loved the Pendant but the chain will need to be replaced. It was too short and too light weight. Othger than that it would have been a 5.
5,Elegant,"This diamond kitty pendant is so pretty! It is dainty but large and sparkly enough to be seen easily! If you have been searching for an everyday necklace and you love kitties, this is FOR SURE the necklace for you!"
3,"Pendant nice, chain not!","The chain with this pendant is much more flimsier than I even expected from these reviews. To make matters worse, the chain came tied in a huge knot which was very difficult to remove given the very fine gauge of the gold. I was terrified I would break it while detangling.This cute kitty pendant definitely deserves a gold chain about 5 times the weight of the current chain. The circle ring clasp is so flimsy that I can't even open it with nails and put it on. Kitty needs a lobster claw clasp! I realize the price of gold is high, but Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this low quality chain."
5,Absolutely adorable!,I bought this for my daughter's 22nd birthday. It is absolutely adorable and well worth the price!!
3,Story of a panther,"This particular title does not provide background information of our beloved Pink Friend.Don't be fooled, it is a great picture book suitable for parents that would like to introduce this quite old fellow to their children, since the Pink Panther show is almost eternal and it is being aired since the seventies.If you are looking for information or an investigation source, this is not the book for you. But if you enjoy a fully drawn story with cute and original art, consider this purchase as your next."
4,Love The Panther!,"I will first start by saying that the Pink Panther is my favorite cartoon charecter so I am a bit biased. That said the book itself is full of really great art by Art Leonardi who did many cartoons of the Panther including some that were used at the animation intro to a few of the movies. Now the book is not a 'history of' the Panther, it is a picture/story book. Think of a large childrens book and thats what you have here. The quality of the book is top notch, great images and colors, large size format. If you are a Panther fan you will like it, but do remember it is a story with great illustrations and not a guide to the Pink Panther."
2,Dangerous for indoor use.,"This item is absolutely not for use on wood/tile/cement floors. Because of the hinged design in each corner, if your puppy pushes against it and it slides too far, it can become too long and narrow and tip over with your puppy inside. For outdoor use or use on carpet it is fine, especially since outdoors you can use the stakes to hold each side in place.I used some zip ties and creative shimming with wood scraps to prevent the corners from folding in, but that is really only a temporary solution. If you're looking for something for indoor use, you might want to look at one of the locked octagon designed playpens for toddlers. Those maintain their shape, and while not as versatile, do not run the risk of collapsing inward on your puppy."
4,Great pen for new pup!,"This pen has been a great tool for training our new puppy. We keep her crate inside the pen, along with a training pad, her toys and her water bowl. She is a Boston Terrier puppy, so she is too small to jump over the sides, but I would imagine some dogs may be big enough to get over the sides. I highly reccommend the ""walk thru door"" model so that you, the owner, can get in & out easily & quickly. The black epoxy finish is nice looking, and the fact that you can open the pen up from one of the panels to make different shapes & sizes is incredibly helpful. One word of note is that you can only open the pen up from the one panel that has the removable pin. Only one panel has this removable pin. This is the one area that the pen could be improved on."
5,best yet!,"This pen is great. I wanted a pen that was not zinc coated for my rabbit and also one which I could enter easily.This pen was just what I was looking for. It folds up to carry easily with its own handle. The pen is well made and does not harm the floor. The cost is cheaper ,even with shipping, than what one could buy at a pet store. I highly recommend this pen, especially for rabbits, as the epoxy coating is safe."
5,My dogs love the exercise pen!!,I recently got a small breed dog and needed a way to keep him safe. I couldn't put up a permenent fence so I got 2 exercise pen that I connected togather to make a larger area around my door. Now he can go out side and run a little and be in a safe confined area without my having to have him on a lease. My older (15 yrs) even enjoys the freedom it gives her. This was the best purchase I could have made.
5,Its nice,I really like the feel of it and it fits my wheel perfectly. the pads on the sides are convenient and make it easy to turn the wheel. i feel i have more control of my car wit hit.
1,so sad,"I was mislead by the picture. I was thinking the ice bucket was the BIG one with the ICE in it in the picture. I received it and saw how small it was (5"" tall) and would only hold like 8-10 ice cubes. This should have been called an ice bowl. I am returning it and getting an ice BUCKET that holds a bucket full of ice and I dont care who's name sells it. Big disappointment! I never bothered unwrapping it before repacking it up to return.* noted it did say how small it was in description but I didnt read and assumed."
5,Review by Author,"If you are interested in this book, please purchase the 2nd printing of the 1st edition. The quality of paper used for the black & white photos is much better than was the case in the initial printing.The paper used for the 12 color plates was very good in both the 1st and 2nd printings. I believe the book would have sold many more copies had the paper quality been addressed properly from the outset.Bob Arnold, PhD"
5,Excellent lab manual for aerial photo-interpretation,"Sometimes it gets a little too detailed (like mentioning the brand of pens commonly used) and the book would be easier to manage if the photos and plates were all in a separate binding (so you can read the text and look at the photos). Some computer based exercises would be good to see what direction the science is moving in. But all in all, a good introduction to aerial photograph interpretation."
2,One Song Stands Out,"I've already written my review, but then I remembered a song that does stand out within the movie. Anne Hathaway's version of the Queen song ""Somebody to Love"" is really quite good and entertaining as well. Were more of the movie like that, it would have been more fun. I beg to differ with other viewers over ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"". I did not like it. Anne's voice was again good, clear and true. The male lead's voice was not. And the song, in my opinion, just didn't fit. It is way too pop and campy in its rendition. More like bad karaoke."
1,No score,"""Original Soundtrack"" it says on the tin, yet there's only one track of the original score. Most soundtrack enthusiasts buy soundtrack for the original score written for the film, in this case masterfully written by Nick Glennie-Smith. This soundtrack provides only the track ""Score Suite by Sean Devel"", and the rest is more or less your run-of-the-mill compilation pop album.A decent soundtrack should contain as much as possible of the original score written especially for the movie, and maybe two or three special songs performed by the actors in the movie. This soundtrack does not deliver and is not recommended for soundtrack lovers."
3,Some better then others..all in all decent.,"All in all this isn't a bad CD for a soundtrack. A few artists stand out much more then others. Like:Kelly Clarkson-Respect- though I've heard this track before, she by far outsings the other female tracks on the CD.The Beu Sisters-Once Upon a Broken Heart-Though they are kinda popish sounding, the girls to have the vocal ability and the song carries nicely.Darren Hayes-Strange Magic- By FAR the best song on the album. The former Savage Garden singer once again shines in the vocal field.Great song, fantastic voice....without this track the CD would loose half of it's appeal.Big surprise: Anne Hathaway can REALLY sing!!!"
3,A few good songs,"Mainly wanted to buy it for Anne Hathaway's version of 'Somebody To Love'. There a few other nice pop songs as well, but for the most part it's forgettable quickly."
4,"Fun soundtrack, but get your facts straight...","The movie and songs are fun, but apparently Amazon doesn't fact check their editorial reviews. ""Strange Magic"" is not an original composition by Darren Hayes - it's an E.L.O. (Electric Light Orchestra) hit from the 70's written by Jeff Lynne. The original is much better than the cover, but the cover is still enjoyable within the context of the movie."
4,Beware the chipmunks,We have a running family joke about chipmunks. I purchased this as a gift for my teen daughter. She enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised at with the quality for this item at a low price. Much nicer than I had expected. It is about the size of a real chipmunk. As a collectible it is one of the most realistic chipmunk type animals that I found when shopping. Fit nicely on top of a Christmas stocking.
3,Wish the cover looked better....,"The journal itself is alright, however on the cover there is a square cut out for you to see a picture of yourself or whoever you decide, on the next page. The clear material used on the covers around the cut out square was not attached well. There are white creases in the corners. The one on the top runs into the words and you can't read them very well. If you try to smooth them out, it only makes it worse and causes scratches on the book. I didn't have time to return the product due to the fact that it was a birthday gift. Besides that flaw, it would serve your purpose."
3,Decent Self-Help Journal,"This is a decent journal with a unique design. I didn't realize this journal was a ""self-help"" type when I bought it, but if you're looking for that it's great. It's funny because the journal is supposed to be serious and motivating, and there's a typo on the last page of Sanders and Sillers' text. The one thing I don't like is the lines on the pages fade in and out, and it's annoying if you're more concerned with writing than an artsy page."
5,Price Discerepancy,"I would like to purchase the ""I Hope You Dance"" journal (ISBN: 1-4016-0030-1). However, I'm hardpressed not to. The reason: Why should I pay 14.99 when the back cover price sticker states USA 12.99? I purchased my first journal, from K Mart, for 12.99. What can Amazon do for me?Sincerely,T S Lenig"
3,Decent quality considering the price,"I paid 29.99 for this sheet set, and I think that I got a decent deal. The sheets are thin, but not super thin. The stitching is pretty basic, but not terrible. I would say that for the price, this is a pretty decent set of sheets. A warning, though: They do not hold up against the rabid onslaught of a claw happy cat. Mine pulverized my sheets within a week of owning them. Stupid cat!"
2,Bad Quality Sheets,Sheets had small holes in them when they arrived. Had to return them for a refund. Poor Quality Control for this Product.
5,They fit!,Nice sheets and finally found sheets that fit my pillow top mattress; not all are created equal in this category. I get tired of trying to find fitted sheets that actual fit the mattress. Thanks
2,Not deep enough,My husband and I just purchased a new king size bed. It was a medium thick mattress - not a pillow top. I like the sheets but we have to pull the bottom sheet back in place and over the mattress every day. I am not really pleased with these.
4,Great Sheets with Great Price!,"Quality sheets for the price I paid for them. They are a rich color and didn't bleed when washed. I had to wash them first because they had a roughness to them, that is why I gave them 4 stars. Overall...great product!"
1,Smells like rotten fish,"Unusable. No point in trying them, as I can't get the awful smell out of them."
5,Wonderful sheets for the price!!!,"Wow, these are exactly what I was looking for. Great feeling sheets that are nice and cool when getting into bed on a warm summer night. Very soft, yet crisp. Not sure what others were talking about not being soft, couldn't really imagine them being any more comfortable. Might have to get me another set of these."
3,Great Sheets - Great Color,"Sheets are great, but be sure to wash before use. The color comes off on your skin otherwise. It washes off, but it was strange to see that I had green hands after handling them before washing them."
3,Good Sheets for the Price,"I have used these sheets for two weeks and they are performing well. The quality is not the best, for example the stiching is only fair workmenship, but the overall product is good."
2,Not very satisfied with these at all.,"These sheets looked very nice on online, however, these sheets wrinkle very easy (even on a low dryer setting) and look like something that you would find at any Kmart and are not very soft. Not happy at all with the quality. Trust me, spend more money a better sheets."
5,WE LOVE THESE SHEETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS FOR THESE SHEET SETS, I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE ROUGH, TOO THIN AND HARD TO FIT MY QUEEN SIZED BED. THESE SHEETS ARE GREAT, WE LOVE THEM. I GOT KING SIZED, AND 1 QUEEN SIZED SHEET SETS, JUST IN CASE I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM FITTING MY BED, EVEN THE QUEEN SIZED SHEET SET FIT MY BED, AND TO THINK I WAS GOING TO SEND THEM BACK EVEN BEFORE I TRIED THEM. O CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT THESE SHEETS SETS, AND YES WE HAVE WASHED THEM A FEW TIMES AND WE STILL LOVE THEM."
1,Bad quality,I order from Amazon all the time and I have never had a problem with their quality but when I got these sheets It was not what I expected they feel rough and hard and not a good feeling to sleep on. I do not recommend these to anyone. I would recommend the 300 Satin which is what I got last time. These suck big time.
1,Does not fit 2007 BMW 328xi,"The blades look great but in contrast the amazon.com product description, they do not fit a 2007 BMW 328xi sedan."
1,does not clip well in bmw 535i,"these are suppose to fit, but do not clip well. the holes are too small. save your cash and just get the wipers directly from a BMW dealer, they are not that much more expensive, this was a complete waste of time and money"
2,"For match success, Match Model/Series for identification","Have a 2007 Saturn Outlook XR. The Bosch ICON WPR 210e is correct for my vehicle. I had to learn the same lesson. The lock assembly is quite sophisticated for something as simple as a windshield wiper. The release mechanism and guide rails really emphasize the need to correctly id the vehicle you're trying to fit. (I thought I would be ""cute"" by going to WMT and pay $16.00......NOT!) Merry Christmas"
2,"These work on my 2010 Jetta, but NOT on a 2011","I bought two sets, one for my 2010 Jetta and the other for my wife's 2011 Jetta.I installed these on my 2010 Jetta, they installed just fine. They clean the windshield fine but did notice a slight chatter a couple of times, that may be because it was 17 degrees outside at the time!As for the 2011 Jetta, they DO NOT FIT! The wiper attach point was changed just enough on the 2011. Both Amazon and Bosch say they will fit but they don't. I think Bosch may have assumed they would but they don't fit the 2011 model.I may keep these for the 2010 Jetta but hope they don't dry rot from sitting while I use the other set.I gave these wipers a below average rating so that anyone looking to buy them will see there is no problem with using them on a 2010 Jetta but not so with a 2011.Overall a good wiper as long as they fit."
4,Easy to Install,"Just like the video shows, this wiper blade was a breeze to install. Just follow the instructions in the online video or on the back of the box. For once, I was able to do car 'maintenance' without asking my better half for help. (Okay, in all honestly, I also know how to change oil and other fluids and change my own tires.)Used the blades during a heavy downpour of rain and they did a fabulous job of removing the moisture from the windshield - keeping the vision clear.Be sure and use the part-finder in the link to find the right size for your vehicle - you will not be disappointed in the Bosch Icon wiper blades.The only question that remains is how long they will last. If they actually make the 40% longer life that is promised on the package, I will definitely revise my 4 stars to a 5"
3,Not for 2006 525i BMW,Amazon said it would fit my car but it does not. I had to improvise by breaking of a piece of plastic in order to get this wiper on.
2,Very Smooth & Quiet,I just installed this wiper and it's been raining all day. It does an excellent job removing the water without any streaks. I can barely hear these wipers when they're on. I'm very satisfied with them and will purchase more in the future.Update: The wipers started streaking after just a month of usage. Changed rating to 2/5 stars.
4,the best of KIM SUNG SOO.,"KIM SUNG SOO was so good in this series. His acting was so deep and so real. We can feels his pains deep down inside in heart. HAN GO EUN also so good in this one. She makes Jung hye Young looks so boring, BORING!!! Besides JHY, everything else was good. The story line, the actors and every twists and turns in LAWYERS will make you cry your heart out."
4,Lawyers,"Amazon could be selling many more Asian boxed sets if it would care to investigate regions useable. Isn't that right on the box, stored at Amazon? There is a store in NY claiming that 70% of its sales are to non-Asians, therefore there is a greater non-ethnic purchase power here. This edition of ""Lawyers"" is probably good in Region 1 because it's the MSNBC version played on TV in New Jersey. Subtitling on those is also good. However, should we take the chance at that price that it IS region 1?"
5,Kudos for ShowOffs Storage Box Products!!!,"Petite, elegant, above all functional enough to fit into my Smith&Hawken gardening-tote bag, for BOTH protecting AND transporting my required tools to art class. Very very happy. Thank you."
3,It's OK and my swing has improved. Don't expect dramatic improvements right away.,My swing has improved and I'm hitting the ball better. Am I a better golfer? Have my scores improved? Only slightly. There is no replacement for hard work and practice. Golf is a hard game. Period.
5,Un Exito Mas...,"Por mas de 25 anos hemos disfrutado de la musica nortena de mis Tigres Del Norte. Con Asi Como Tu continuamos adorando a nuestros Idolos del Pueblo. Mis canciones preferidas en este CD son ""Quiero Volar Contigo"" y ""Te Sone Conmigo"". Bueno si, soy una eterna romantica y no quiero menospreciar ninguna de las otras canciones. Pues, mis Tigres nunca me han defraudo con sus producciones."
1,Very bad,"Hernandez seeks to take Mariachi music in to new fields and pastures, but why do it so badly? I know this mariachi has put some good stuff out before and can do better. The only thing good about this album is the Glenn Miller popurri, but if you've seen Sol de Mexico live in concert, it's old news. However, Hernandez plays some good solo jazz trumpet. The song that he should have stayed away from was ""El Cuartro."" God Damn! They really butchered that ""son jalisciense."" Silvestre Vargas must have been rolling in his grave. Ruben Fuentes must have cringed. There are definitely some older albums by Sol de Mexico one should look at and hear."
1,Montavani With A Sombraro!!!!!,"I must admit, I was searching for my first Mariachi CD after enjoying the small wandering Mariachi bands during a recent trip to Mexico. If anyone is looking for authentic music, steer clear of this one! Way over produced, sappy, and sounds like a pops orchestra or Las Vegas show! I hated it!!! Would love to know where I can find some authentic Mariachi music?"
3,I returned it,This item I mis diagnosed and was not the fix. I wound up sending it back. Replaced the valve and it still doesn't work. I may need to buy it again.
4,Works fine on Amana AFD2535FES,"Shipment was quick. Swapped cable and shut off bar from OEM unit and installed without any problem. It's been working fine for 3 months now. Needing to swap cable & bar are only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars (would've been 5 if this were ""perfect"" fit for this model refrigeartor)."
1,Maytag Ice Maker,"This unit has quit twice. I have had to remove it and let it thaw out, reinstall it and then it starts to work. But I suppose I should not expect more since it's MADE IN CHINA.Next time on anything I buy I will ask where it was made."
4,ice maker replacment,Expressed ordered and received on the date promised. Ice maker had the clip for the wiring harness on the opposite end that I needed it for. Removed and placed where I needed it to be. Installed easily and has worked great so far.
5,ice maker,It came much sooner than expected which was great. It came in good condition. The only complaint was lack of instructions. Luckily I had someone that knew how to uninstall the old and put in the new one. I was very impressed.
5,It is an Icemaker,This product fits the assigned slot in the fridge as described and makes ice. Not a lot else you can say about that.
3,hi. good book,"um. i think this book is good. um, im gonna use it for my next book to read in class. If is a good book to read. Um, i like baseball. GO METS!"
3,"Was on Ok product, but would not buy again",In my opinion this is an ok product....quality could be better. The paint looks a bit tattered.....also these magnets only stick one way so there is no point to numbers on the jerseys which you can never see. Top hangers on the jersey are very flimsy and one has already broke off.
4,A Fun Read - But:,"Great photos, and an entertaining narrative of their voyage.But:They had several close call/misadventures that all apparently resulted from Dag's decisions to paddle into known poor conditions, and good luck that allowed them to survive the predicaments they got into. Kayaking is great fun, but paddling a little boat in big water means you have to be willing to adapt your plans to stay safe. Maria seems to be the sensible one - she should be the skipper!Boy-o-boy are they ever hyper-greenies. You know - harvesting trees is not mortal sin. Some people make their living in the timber industry in order for other people to have wood for houses, furniture - even kayaks. The book would be much better without the preaching.Even with these caveats - it's a fun read and I recommend it."
2,Dissapointing,the soap dispenser often does not open to feed soap to the cleaning. Also the bottom rack often comes off the tracks and is difficult to roll back in
1,Expensive machine with poor results,I just bought a house with this dishwasher installed. It is quite but will not wash dishes properly as others have said. It will not dry dishes well either. I suppose this makes it just a rinsing machine. I knew it was expensive and was trying to determine if it needed a repair or be replaced. After finding reviews here I was determined to replace it. A couple of weeks later it made a loud sound while washing then I smelled hot electronics then the unit died. The previous owner said the machine was only 3 years old. I replaced it with a whirlpool gold dishwasher and have clean dishes finally and for half the price.
1,Not worth the money by far,"As another reviewer wrote, this dishwasher does an extremely poor job of drying the dishes. Also despite trying a variety of rinse aid products there is a persistent white spotting of the dishes. Also the stench does get quite bad if not used for several days. All in all I am very disappointed with this product and it will be the last LG product I ever buy."
5,A new American classic in the making,"A wonderful boy that you either wish to be your son or to be yourself is the hero of this new American classic coming-of-age story. Each part of the book communicates American heart and soul and grit. I recommend it to all, young old and between. If you don't read another book this year,read Tailwind by Lad Moore because your heart will swell with joy."
1,Worthless because didn't get what I ordered.,Can't give anykind of a review because I didn't get the book that I ordered. The one I did get was worthless to me and I have to return it. Trying to get the correct book has been a MAJOR hassel. I will have to find somewhere else to purchase it.
4,You need this book to become a CPP,"This book helps you to pass the CPP, but make sure to get the answer key that you need to purchase separately because the book does not provide the answers."
5,Very pleased,Very pleased with this seller. The item was as described and arrived quicker than i expected. To receive this item as quick as i did just before christmas it shows they have a great business and care for their customers. Thank you
1,The silliest little book I have ever seen!,"I have been dating online for eight years, and consider myself to be somewhat of an expert on the matter. I bought this book for my father, widowed after 41 years of marriage. But even after a year of online dating, I believe he knows more than this book purported to teach. It contains no information not widely available on the internet. It was outdated the year it was published (2001). And the most preposterous section in it was about spelling and grammar--ironic, for a small book rife with orthographic errors! I can't believe the authors managed to get it published. Please don't waste your money."
3,Average,"This stand alone book written by Lisa Scottoline has all of the usual ""Scottoline"" trademarks. Humour, sarcasm and of course the legal/thriller component.This book was easily readable and unfortunately, just as easily forgettable.Nothing new here.I am having serious problems reading the new offerings by our ""well known"" authors. I feel as though they keep rehashing the same things over and over again.Time to find new authors."
4,Good read,I usually listen to rather than read books these days. I did enjoy this one and it kept my interest.
3,Lightweight,"...very lightweight. The construction of the love story reminds me of women's books, romantic novels, written fifty years ago.Although, I must admit, her remarks about sex in the shower are right on the button."
3,Street smarts,"There's a rundown, drug infested neighborhood in Philadelphia known as Devil's Corner, where the father of Assistant U.S. Attorney Victoria Allegretti grew up. On a routine call to the hood, Vicki's partner is gunned down, and, Vick being Vick, she plunges into the quest to nail the perp. The very next day, the addicted mother of Raheema Bristow is cruelly murdered, and she reluctantly agrees to provide Vicki with the street smarts necessary to navigate this jungle.As a crime/police procedural novel, Devil's Corner is simplistic and, in parts, incredible. But the chemistry that develops between Raheema and Vicki is fun. There's a particularly entertaining scene in which Raheema can only roll her eyes over Vick's vocabulary. But Vick leads Raheema into some truly inane situations, and the reader has to wonder how she gets away with her impulsive, law-breaking tactics. But if you're willing to forgo veracity, there's some entertainment to be had in Devil's Corner."
3,Like a Buddy Movie,"I just finished Devil's Corner, by Lisa Scottoline. It is alightweight legal thriller (with almost zero courtroom scenes), similarto the Tannenbaum books in that it is about a prosecutor. The maincharacter is an Assistant US Attorney. She has to go way off thereservation to investigate a couple murders and some drug stuff thatshe has been told to lay off of. She is working with a woman who hadbeen a suspect. It turns into a kind of buddy adventure with these twowomen doing surveillance and getting into trouble. They are unlikelyallies - a Harvard grad AUSA and a street-smart, black woman who is sobeautiful that men act stupid around her. It would make a fun movie ina sort of a Beverly Hills Cops way. Nicely written and entertaining,though as I said, pretty lightweight. It has elements that I require -good setting (Philadelphia in Winter), interesting characters, and apretty good plot with some surprises. I'd rent the movie, if there wasone."
2,ONLY ME??,Is it only me that did not care much for this book?? I loved all the others by Lisa Scottoline. But this one I found the character to be really dumb. So many things she did were not bright.I was wishing for Bennie and her girls to return. I don't care to see more of this new one
3,Good But Nothing Special,"The author has a very interesting story to tell and she has the ability to tell it well. The story moves along at a slow clip until one is almost halfway through it. The first half of the book has characters that are extraneous to the deveopment of the plot and some are rather poorly developed. It is in the first phase of the book that the story is quite predictble and very sloe reading. As the story goes into its second half, the action finally picks up and there arenumerous twists supplied by the writer in this good, but not great, work of fiction."
2,my friend was in this movie lolz,"So this is an extremely cheezy family movie from the mid 90's. It was filmed in and around Nashville and I'm pretty sure all or at least most of the actors were local. A friend of mine actually played the role of Freddie in this movie and after weeks of begging him he finally let me watch it. It's not terrible, but unless you're watching with your children or something don't waste your time because you will definitely want that 90 minutes back. My friend is under contract for a sequel so I'm praying they make a second film... especially now that he's in his mid 20's. Anyways I figured I would post something since apparently NO ONE else has ever seen this movie lol. Love you Rev."
2,Mislead,I read one of the reviews on this item about the product being shipped slightly different than pictured. He was definitely right and the picture is VERY misleading. Even the box I got it in has the wrong picture. That NEEDS to be changed. The pictured model you would have the longer length of the rest (ears) running the same direction as the rifle. It does not. The rest (ears) runs perpendicular to the long part of the base not parallel to the base as pictured. It will work but the more support the better so I'm disappointed. The only reason I'm keeping it is because I bought it used and it was filled so it was a good deal and it will work. Just not as good as the pictured one
1,Not For Serious Shooters,"This bag is too flimsy. The ears will not stand up, especially under the weight of a heavy BR rifle. I now use it as a riser bag (ears flattened) when I need to raise the stock of the rifle. Shooting bags, like scopes need to be purpose bought. Whoever designed this bag probably didn't use it. This is a product (Like a scope) where you need to spend a little more money and get a good one to start with."
2,The product shown on Amazon is not the product shipped,"I ordered the Stoney Point rear shooting bag based on the photo on Amazon. When the product arrived, the photo on the box was the same as the photo on Amazon and what I thougt I was getting. I opened the box to find a different shaped shooting bag. The wings are horizontal to the bag not parallel as shown in the photos. I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped me another sandbag. When it arrived, same problem, right photo, wrong product."
5,Excellent Product!,This is an excellent rear shooting bag rest. Well worth the money to help take out human error. I use it in conjunction with a Caldwell Rock Jr. Metal Front Rifle Rest and Caldwell or Harris short bipods.
4,shooting bag.,"How can you go wrong with sand bags? They are stable, and reliable. They would work best if you have a shhing platform that was high enough to line well with tarhet. I would recommend, and but this product again"
