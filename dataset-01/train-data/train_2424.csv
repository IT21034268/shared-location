1,My phone slid right out of it and busted on the pavement,It was in the case and on my belt and the phone slid right out and busted on the pavement. Get yourself a real caste.
2,Not secure,"The belt clip pops off way too easily. I returned it. Good idea ,but bad design. Too much chance of dropping the Note 2 which is too expensive to chance."
4,It served it's purpose,"The case was very good for protecting the phone. Clipped on well, but you have to take it out of the case each time to answer or use it. If that's not a problem for you, then you'll like the case. I still would rate it about 4 1/2 stars."
3,Samsung Note 2 Cost,Case looks good but the spring on belt clip feel off on 5th day of use and clip came off a day later. I was able to attach the clip but lost the spring. Working on getting a replacement.
4,BoxWave Dual+ Holster Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Case - 3-in-1 Case with Holster Combo Includes Protective Case and Belt Clip Holster,I just received my case and I love it. It can be used for almost anything I can think of. In the stand mode I set my Galaxy Note II as a clock or watch Netflix on it. The case seems to protect the phone pretty even thought I haven't dropped my phone much since I've gotten it. The case being so grippy could be the reason why I haven't dropped it. It's worth the $12.
1,not worth the time or money,"easy ordering, great fast delivery, terrible product. one of the side pieces that hold the phone into the holster broke after 2 days. didn't drop it or anything. just broke. non-fixable. threw it away and started looking for something better."
1,Strongly recommend you to NOT purchase this item!!!,"I purchased this this item with the intent to have a quality holster, to clip onto my belt, for my Note 2. Not only did the clip break within 3 days of me having it, it broke on something so simple as my seatbelt. Fortunately the phone landed on my lap and not the ground. Pretty sure I'll just go on ahead and purchase an OtterBox now."
2,Clip is poorly made! Be weary of this one.,"If you catch the edge of your phone on something while wearing this case you can expect the holster to come apart at the swivel clip, and your phone falling to the floor. Not sure I would risk my $700 phone to a $12 case! FAIL!"
1,No Good.,Item was a hard plastic that was not to appealing to the touch. The clip for your belt just comes off so easy. And it is so hard to get out of the holster. You must use two hands and obviously not while on your belt. This has to be one of the worst purchases I have made.
1,Don't BUY,As much as I love that product as it slims down the note II phones and it's not bulky as much as I hate the fact that as soon as you bend the clip is completly brooken. It need to be strengthen from the clip area so it doesn't break. My recommendation is don't buy as this is my second one in less that two month.
2,good product,Its a good product. I like to clip it onto my belt or pocket. You can lock the clip so that it can stay open and you can set it on a table and watch YouTube
1,PISSED,"I not happy with this item the clip broke n about a week,& it kept ccoming apart b4 it finally broke, KMT"
1,Dont waste you money!!!,I lost my money and time. Holds the note perfectly but the clip es fragil. Used for 3 hs and gooonee!!!
1,NOT THE RIGHT FIT,Does not fit the Note and ruined the phone just to get the case off. I would not recommend buying.
1,Broke the same day!!!!!!@!,Recieved the case and after a couple of hours the clip on the back broke off its seemed sturdy but guess looks are fooling.. I would not recommend buying this for I am lucky ny phone didnt crack when it took the swan dive and hit the floor!!!
1,it sucks,it broke first time i used itit sucks !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!! !!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!! !!! !!!!! shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
1,Poor Quality!!!,"The first week, the clipper is broken. 2 months later the plastic case is cracked for no reason. The case is probably made of recycled plastic so the quality is pretty bad. Do not wast your money!"
1,broken,received broken merchandise...beyond pissed .. took it out of the package and it was broken..wouldlikeanotherone..this time in tact .. I would greatly appreciate it
2,Don't care for this,"Thin materiel would not last long, inexpensive looking. Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad, returned item."
4,Great Case,"Light weight, stable, protects your cell phone screen from the elements, etc. Although the clip appears a bit delicate, so you might want to buy two cases just in case it breaks someday. Other than that I love the case."
3,solid case bad design,"i want to love this case solely because it feels nice in the hand, not too bulky, but i cannot do so mainly because of the glaring design flaws.Pro's:for the cost it is relatively well built doesnt feel cheaphas a nice holster, can be a little irritating on the skin if your pant doesnt sit snugly on your waist.Consthe cutouts for the buttons are too deep, hence cannot really press the power/volume rockers without a sense of digging through a hole to reach them.3 stars since i cannot give 3.5.you get what you pay for, hoping that these guys learn from this and come back better."
1,Clip breaks off very easily,"I liked the look and feel of the holster, but the clip/kick stand is held on by a very weak clip. A mild bump into a wall or car door, etc and the phone goes flying to the ground with the clip still sitting there on your pocket/belt, etc.This makes it virtually useless for anything more than very carefully holding the phone up while watching vids or something.Disappointing."
3,Clipe broke but I still use it,"I bought a couple covers for my Note 2, the box wave was mainly so I could clip it on my belt. But as others said, I caught it on my seat belt and the clip broke off. Didn't make much sense to send it back, I did like how it worked. I used some pliers to remove the remaining nub on the case and just use it in my pocket. Works pretty good, though I am looking at other cases.Another note, while the part of the case that covers the phone, I like the feel and construction, but it doesn't really cover the top or bottom of the phone. So I use a Mercury TPU case I bought instead. Still slips nicely into the boxwave holster.Mercury Slim Fit Flexible TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Black)"
4,Horrible shipping but great product,"I just received the product, I actually pre-ordered it while it was actually a lower price so kudos to Boxwave for that. The case itself make the phone have a premium feel to it the ridged back to it make it easier to hold on to and not feel awkward. The phone clips into place inside one case and slides into the other. While others do not like that it doesn't face out, this is my first clip case and I actually like that it does not. There is no need for people to know what kind of phone I have to be tempted to unhook and run. What was not mentioned was the soft cloth that is used on the inside of the sliding portion to not scratch the gorilla glass. If you are like me you already have a screen protector on the phone anyway and the two just slide easily across each other. I like the phonecase but I have to give the clip a test run in everyday life but no complaints. Great cutouts for the pen camera and buttons too"
2,Phone broke!,"I've had this holster less than two weeks, and yesterday my phone slid out of the holster, fell to the ground, and cracked the glass on the corner of my phone! :-( It fails to do the two things it is supposed to do: hold the phone securely, and protect it from breaking if it falls. Other holsters actually 'snap' the phone into place, so that even if it turns upside down it stays in place; this one just slides out, no snap/lock. Even that would have been OK, but they didn't design the case to go all the way around the corner of the phone, so when it falls and lands on the corner, it can break the phone (like mine did, the very first time it fell). I wouldn't recommend this holster, I'll be looking for a new one..."
5,The perfect holster for the Galaxy Note II,"I bought this for my man and he loves it! When they say ""dual"" it comes with a hard cover case that you insert into the holster which is also hard, and secure. It rotates 180 degrees. It has a clip for your belt, as well as a part to make it stand on it's own so you can sit your phone upright on the night stand/dresser. All in all a GREAT purchase! If you have a Galaxy Note II I say get this and get it quickly! :-)CC"
2,Nice but broke it in 3 days,I'm not the most gentle person on equipment. This is a nice try but the clasp holding on the belt clip came off in my hand the first day. I was able to snap it back into place fairly quickly. Three days later I seat down in my car the holster hit the seat belt and the holster belt clip plastic broke. Game over.Believe even gentle people will have a problem with this product.
5,Double Protection,"Although my item came a week late, it was worth waiting for. I have dropped it a few times and not a scratch. Having the kickstand is great because I can watch Netflix with no problem. Definitely a great buy!!!!"
2,Great until it broke :(,I chose this rating because I really liked the look and feel of the case. It didn't make the phone feel any bigger and it gave the phone just enough weight and grip for one hand operation. It was nice to have a holster that doubled as a kickstand which rotated for landscape or portrait viewing. What sucks about this phone is the holster setting is flimsy and broke from me trying to set it up to watch something on YT. I have only had this item for a week! I also ordered one for my husband and on the first day his holster popped off. It has since popped off numerous times and although its easy to pop back on its very annoying to him. He wears his on his belt which means everything is falling on the ground. I usually kept mine in my purse or pocket and thought mine would surely out live his. NOPE! I would say skip this item unless you plan on ordering a few for reserve or Never using the kickstand/holster. It isn't built to last.
3,Holster,"Product arrived surprisingly early, which was great. The only issue I would have is that the clip comes apart too easily and that may be because of the size of the phone. The case works and looks great."
1,unhappy,The box wave holster didn't last me 3 days and it broke the 3rd day by me just opening it up to put on the belt clip very unhappy
2,Inferior & Dangerous to your $Pocket!!,"Product did not arrive in the suggested time frame, 2nd day, the pin for the holster clip spring came out while on my belt and my new Galaxy fell to the concrete. China doing its very best with its products to cripple the USA image as usual."
2,Very flimsey,"Cheaply made, get what you pay for. Found a better one before this one arrived. so never used it. Okay?"
2,"Yea, it's exactly what you thought.","I took one for the team. Your paying for one and only one. only identifiying marks are the tag that is strung around it and a ""made in china"" sticker. It's dropped in a cardboard reinforced bubble mailing package.Now if you have any size in your forearms at all, you may want the large. I figured I'd go middle of the road to be safe. I can just barely squeeze it about a little ways up my forearm. And if your slick with sweat these things are going to fly right off.On a good note; they are very comfortable as long as your arm isn't turning purple. They feel much better than wrist weights. They aren't ichy or hot. It is actually very easy to forget they are their. That being said, get two for each arm, their pretty light. But they are just about perfect if you already have hand weights."
5,A top quartile book,"This is a another great straight-ahead book. I really hope this book gets noticed. Involved, but not over the top at all. A real joy to read.I read and rate 8 to10 books in this genre each month. I rate each book based on a 0-5 point scale. This book rated as follows: Characters: 4. Realism: 3.25. Description: 3.50. Ah Ha: 3.75. The Read: 4.00 Overall, the book ranked 34 out of 365 books"
4,Another Spiegelman Sparkler,"While some reviewers here lament what they think was a slow and aimless plot, I found this book to be well-done, fascinating and riveting. It's refreshing to occasionally read a thriller that is not slam-bang, unrealistic violence and action on every page. This is a well-thought-out, well crafted piece of work that moves strongly forward. The characters are well-defined, the place descriptions (mostly New York)are vivid and real and human interplay between the good guy and possible bad guys is compelling. All of which leads me to my opinion that Spiegelman is truly a master of the genre. In other words, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more Spiegelman sparklers."
2,Disappointing,"Spiegelman's first book ""Black Maps,"" was one I very much enjoyed. I wish I could say the same for this. It wasn't bad, but it seemed to plod along, without much happening, never being terribly involving or suspenseful. For me, part of the problem was that I never really cared about any of the characters except Jane, Marsh's girlfriend, who was the most interesting one of the group and received a bad deal in her relationship with Marsh. Maybe I'm tired of perpetually angst-driven, commitment-phobic protagonists. So while it wasn't terrible, it was definitely a disappointment. Read ""Black Maps"" and, if you do read this, wait for it in paperback."
1,Slow boat to nowhere,"This book appears to be a description of how independently wealthy people live in New York, and, oh, there's a ""mystery"" or something going on. Predictable plot, inflatable characters, silly premises and a sudden but boring ""twist"" at the end -- this book is resoundingly mediocre and a chore to make it through. I recommend it only if you're having trouble getting wet logs to catch on fire but make sure you remove the plastic-coated jacket."
3,Another good probability and statistics book,A good thing about this books is the examples. He uses the same data sets to demonstrate how several statistics techniques can be applied to those data sets.
5,More than a how-to guide,"This book is more of a psychology read than anything, and a good one at that. It proves to be a great pick-up read here and there. The information is quite useful!"
3,same as He Comes Next,"I bought Passionista as well as He Comes Next, thinking they would have different content, but they're almost exactly the same, nearly verbatim.They're interesting, not really as helpful as She Comes First. Reading one is sufficient."
4,Excellent read and very informative,I really enjoyed the way the book was formatted into 2 sections. I feel like that real allowed to see both sides of the connecting with your partner. My partner and I have had great conversations as a result of this book.
1,"Where is the ""UMPH""?","This book is well written on certain topics but doesn't go into details on others. There are no pictures to explain some of the things the author is speaking about. I mean I am not clueless to sex but sometimes you want to see the actual picture as an example. He talked about using certain techniques, but I should not have to go to Google to find out what they are because in a book I purchased, they decide not to go into futhur detail. I wish I could return this book but it's just too much of a hassle...what a waste.I was looking for a book on SEX, not psychology."
4,Passionista: The Empowered Woman's Guide to Pleasuring a Man,Was interesting reading. I bought 2 books. Provided one to a friend. We will see if this works or not for her and help me
5,Good read.,This is a great book for those who want to know more about pleasing a man. It is well written and well set up for easy referencing.
4,HOT BUT DRY,"I would recommend this book to anyone. I was amazed at what I learned and just applying a few of the techniques in this book will maximize your and your partner's experience.As the author conveys throughout the book, the secret to having an exciting relationship in the bedroom is to first have an exciting one outside of it.I enjoyed this book, but didn't really feel that Dr. Kerner provided enough detail on the workings of the male body. The book seemed to lack depth and felt rushed along. A good jumping off point. It's easy to think from She Comes First that that's what this book is going to be about, but really it's just a small piece of a bigger idea.Youporn Sex Positions 101 For Short and Long Penis - Spice Up Your Sex Life at Any Stage of Life - Strategic Tips To Drive Your Partner Wild in Bed101 Chocolate Sex Positions: With An Ultimate Safe Sex Guide For Guaranteed Satisfaction At Any Age and Shape"
2,average,I thought this was average I was look for something more not for me. I think I may need visual not to just hear it.
3,fairly informative,"I enjoyed this book, but didn't really feel that Dr. Kerner provided enough detail on the workings of the male body. The book seemed to lack depth and felt rushed along. A good jumping off point."
2,Ok...,"The book is OK, but nothing like its counterpart She comes first. That one is a much better book with lot's of techniques, this book is very philosophical about the whole relationship issue and connection between two people. Not very excited about it and certainly did not learn any new techniques."
1,Boring fluff full of outdated generalizations,"If you are an experienced and enlightened lover do not waste your time reading this book.At best, Passionista is lackluster. Basically, it's 200 pages of outdated and inaccurate generalizations about sexuality.Any moron could have picked up a couple copies of Cosmopolitan and Maxim and come up with the same contents of this book.Don't expect to learn a darn thing!"
4,good surround sound,"I chose these mainly to replace sony bookshelfs for home theater surround. The sonys were o.k. if placed high enough[otherwise the weak highs are drowned out] . . the yamahas offer better positioning,good response and a sealed enclosure. It may be too soon for a full review, but listening to these for home theater surround produces a very natural effect with my bic center and polk tsi100s..they may not outperform jbl, but for their size/limitations/ the comparable sound is very high quality..and a very good value for their intended use. Add on-the bic center is a dv52clr...there are bigger[and priceyer] ones out there, but the goal is to create a balanced soundfield with similar drivers/efficiency...o.k. I'm done.."
3,Yamaha Outdoor Speakers,"Good, solid, well-built speakers for outdoors. Mounts easily. A bit disappointed in the sound, but they are small, so they don't get the base sounds you may be used to on larger units."
2,Wish i could return it,"I purchased this product with the notion of ""you get what you pay for"", but in this case I got less. While the sound quality is decent, I could not play this louder than 1/4 of range of the volume control of my stereo. I would hear crackles and pops once I got past the quarter mark on my volume control. Alas, this came to close to a deadline and had no choice but to use it. I had to keep volumes at a minimum and reduce bass to 1/2 on my eq. I would not recommend this for outdoor us."
2,Sound like crap!,Bought these as a cheap replacement for older Yamaha speakers (one had failed). They sound like your listening to an old AM radio through a tin can. Do yourself a favor and get the 350 or 390 series...
4,worth the money,Overall a good product for the money. I did not want to spend $100 for a pair of outdoor speakers. These speakers were easy to install and sound good. I am glad I did not get the bigger pair. These are big enough.
4,sounds great,"Bought these with an inexpensive Pyle tuner for pool area. They are fantastic, great sound, easy setup and blend right into the background."
5,Great outdoor speakers,"Great sound,have them installed on the out side of a beach house by our pond. very clear sound,for the price you couldn't find a nicer pair of speakers. Highly recommend."
5,Great buy,"I bought these speakers for our camper knowing that if I ever sell my camper I can put them up on our deck. In our camper they are powered just by a car radio. These speakers aren't made for this type of power but they still sounded great. I think they would be amazing powered off of a home stereo. The sound is great and I was very impressed. Another great thing is they are not real big so they can fit in a nice spot. Plus, you can hang then or put the ""standing"" bracket on them and just sit them on a shelf. I love them."
4,Good Bang for the Buck,"First off, the speakers arrived 4 days early, and in perfect shape. Although mounting hardware was non-existant, I had no problems installing them to my garage wall. They have a great sound quality..... for the money, I have no compaints. They easily blow the doors off other exterior speakers I have heard. Listen to other speakers, then decide for yourself."
5,Phenomenal,"These are hands down the best outdoor speakers I have ever heard. The sound reproduction is remarkably clear...I hear instruments in the music that I hadn't heard before, even with my indoor system.Unfortunately, they sound so much better than my indoor speakers that I will probably have to upgrade those now.Great speakers, great price, and quick shipping with Prime. Thank you Yamaha and Amazon."
5,Fantastic Deal,"These speakers are an incredible buy. I bought two pair for my parent's patio and deck as a Christmas gift. They sound great and are a breeze to install. Construction feels solid, like most Yamaha products.For the size of the speakers (and price) you get a good amount of bass and an overall great sound. I'd highly recommend these speakers to anyone looking for a good pair of outdoor speakers, but not wanting to break the bank!"
5,Volume Of Sound!,"Had old pair of KLM or somthing like that? Replaced them with the Yamaha and as I expected it was far above a better product. The realy great thing is that I actually believe I spent less for these upgraded speakers and it has been about 5 years later. Fills the backyard pool area up with great sound. Easy install, great sound & great price, is there anything else you want from outdoor speakers? We will see if holds the test of time!"
5,Great little speakers,"I had to replace a set of (cheaper) outdoor speakers that just didn't hold up to the elements. While I haven't gone through a winter with these yet, I can tell the Yamaha set are better designed to deal with rain, snow, sun, etc. In addition, the sound is much improved. They won't rival my nicer indoor speakers, but the music on the patio sounds great. The mounting brackets are also well done, as the installation under the eave of a roof was simple and quick. All I could wish for is that the price goes back to where it was when I bought these (June 2012 - $58) and I'd get another set!"
5,Great Speakers for the Pool Area,These speakers are easy to install and sound very good. Installed them next to our swimming pool as replacements for an old pair that had worn out.
5,GREAT,"i purchased this item over 1 yr ago and now i can review them correctly i set them up on our porch up under the eves i wired them with ""monster wire"" less distortion than other wires based on past exp.they produce a great sound throught the whole front yard when i am out there its clean crisp and very clear they have held up very well look and act as new i would highly reccomend thease to anyoneand also the system i have them on is a high powered yamaha component system with amplifier and lots of extras i only mention this to say they work very well even in a ""high powered"" system unlike many others that can not take the watts from the amp.."
2,"Good sound, does not hold up in the heat","The sound on these speakers is great, however, after having them installed under the eaves of the roof above our patio, one of the grills started to fall off. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the grills are glued on with some adhesive, and the heat softened it to the point that the grills are loose. I will be returning them."
4,Very pleased,"I'm hesitant to rate these as I've yet to really blast them due them being in my backyard and not wanting to annoy my neighbors. But as outside speakers on my deck, they are working out great. The music sounds really good. It's a big jump up from a boombox or portable iPod dock/speaker system. They were easy to install with the included mounting brackets, and I like that they come with mini stands if you just want to set them up somewhere in the house. I'm sure these aren't the best speakers out there, so that's why I'm giving 4 stars. But for the price, I'm 5 stars happy and would recommend them."
5,Awesome,"The were easy to install, sound great and look great on the patio. I am thinking of getting another pair for the inside sun room and may be the gym!"
4,Good speakers for the price,Great value for outdoor speakers we installed by deck and they are wonderful out there hooked up through some speakerwire to an amp and Spotify and Music on Computer Sound qulaity is perfect for back yard areas campgrounds ext.
2,Price matches Sound,These speakers should not be used when expecting high quality sound output. Also the terminal connecters are flimsy since once broke off when attaching a spade conncetor.
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for ""noise"" outside then go for it. But I have this pair of speakers on my deck to replace a pair ruined from the Feb storms, and a pair of ""other speakers in the rear garden. THe sound difference from those $40 speakers compared to these are night and day. These speakers have absolutely no depth or base. They provide no reflection and really aren't worth the money when you can find a better pair of speakers at a lower price.Keep looking."
2,Seriously lacking in sound quality,"I bought these based upon what other reviewers said about their great sound quality. Unfortunately, I'm not hearing what they're hearing. I listen to mainly hip hop, electronic, and soul. The bass is entirely inadequate for hip hop; it sounds roughly like a boombox's speakers turned way up. The sound is also very hollow, with vocals seeming to come from behind drywall. Also, I'm using these indoors in a small room, so I can't blame it on the sound being washed out by outdoors noise and wind. Simply speaking, they just lack that crispness, tightness, and depth that I expect from decent speakers."
3,OK for price,good for patio or deck....don't expect too much as they're $80 !!! Average sound...you get what you pay for !!
2,No hook up for ipad 2,I'm having a very hard time hooking it up to my iPad 2. I'm unable to listen to iPad recordings.
2,speakers,"It was unclear on the hook up for these speakers from the descriptions, so I assumed I might have no trouble using them with my computer. The instructions even reference a specific type of cable that they don't offer. Needless to say, I have two maybe great speakers that have to wait until I get a receiver for them."
5,Great Sound,Very pleased with the sound from these speakers. I installed them under the eaves on my back porch. They are a little larger than I expected but they blend in and arent even noticeable. The included brackets allow for a decent range of motion for installation. My only complaint would be the lack of screws for installation - 4 wood screws or sheet metal screws would have been nice.
5,Great speakers!,I looked very hard at speakers before I bought these. I could have spent much more money than this on speakers. I was hesitant to spend such a small amount and think that they might be good. But they are worth every penny. I have a large patio and they sound greaat wherever I stand. I would recommend these to anyone.
3,Just OK,"I replaced some 10 year old no name speakers outside that are under a covered patio. While the construction and mounting is very good,these just dont have that nice crisp sound, and the sound does not radiate,the bass seems to overpower the highs tones. I dont hate them,but I am replacing 2 more speakers ,and will try something else."
4,very good outdoor speakers for average user,"I""m no stereo guru ... average guy that wanted music for the pool deck. Went to radio shack and bought some (what the guy called average wire) 16 gauge indoor/outdoor wire which fit onto the screw-together connections for the speakers. Also, I found an old Aiwa speaker system (only 40 watt) but connected these and it sounds good (decent base/treble) sounds like any other radio if it were outside.WARNING: I did do a little homework and you have to know what ohm your speakers are. The system I was connecting to were 6 ohm and so were these speakers :-) there are some other that look just like this that are 8 ohm so you have to know what you're connecting (even though I really didn't)"
4,Sournd Advice,These new Yamaha outdoor speakers were installed on our existing deck replacing a wireless system. What a difference in the quality of sound. The base is surprising for their size with lows exceeding my expectations. Good sound reproduction is also achieved through the entire range making these speakers a bargain.
4,Very Nice,"These speakers sound great. For the money they are the best I've heard. I luckily had in wall surround sound speakers, so I just pulled them out, drilled through the brick behind them, ran another set of speaker wires, and then mounted the speakers using a standard drill and a masonry bit. Had to buy some brick/concrete screws also. Easy install, great well rounded sound."
5,Fantastic speakers for the price point,"Great speakers for outside. Big, rich sound for the price point. I look forward to enjoying these speakers all spring, summer and fall."
4,Great for the price,Had these for about a month now. They are just what they say they are. I had higher end Bose speakers before but for the money these are great. I got mine for $53.00 a pair. Surprising bass out of these speakers. I would reccomend them to my friends.
5,Great speakers,"Great little speakers for the price, sound great, look good! Very happy with this purchase, couldn't ask for more!"
5,"Quality speakers, well recommended","I used these for an outdoor wedding reception two nights in a row, and the output from them was perfect. The brackets that came with them were useful for attaching to outdoor objects - in my case a tree branch and a pole! I had bought 'universal' speaker stands to go with these but soon discovered they weren't that universal. But they were easy to set up and provided constant high quality output for many hours at a time. Highly recommended"
5,Sounds great after being drenched in several heavy rain storms.,"I purchased this item several weeks ago for my deck. Easy to mount and sounds clear. Since then there has been heavy rain storms. Even after the speakers were soaked from all the rain, I pumped the music to them expecting them to sizzle and WOW! I heard music! The music that came out sounded great! Just like new. Great Speakers and can withstand the test of my loud outdoor parties."
5,Tape Worm Tapes,"Great product! Gave this to my cats and the next days it was finished. No more worm. Thought it was going to hard to give them the pills, it wasn't. It works."
2,Hard to Swallow,"My cats didn't receive much of this medicine because they kept spitting it out. I think the company should make this ""chicken"" flavor to aide in the digestion. I also used a pill injector, which worked to no avail."
1,Didnt work,Gave to cat I knew had tapeworms. Still has tapeworms coming out her but weeks later. This is not the first time entirely pets has sent me something that didnt work. Frontline was the last. Will not order anything from entirely pets anymore.I wonder if they are getting knock off stuff.
5,Works Great - a gift to our cats,"We have 7 cats, 4 indoor and 3 who have adopted us. I noticed that one of our outdoor cats had tape worms. Not wanting to pass the worms to the other outdoor cats I ordered these tabs and they worked. Incidentally these outdoor cats are well taken care of and sleep in our garage with heat every night. Also are vaccinated."
5,Great Product!,"This was a little tricky to get down, but worked great and saved me a trip to the vet."
1,Wrong Picture For Album Being Sold,"The album being sold by this vendor is not ""THIS PRICE IS RIGHT"". It is different compilation titled ""THE PRICE IS RIGHT"". It contains only 3 of the songs on ""THIS PRICE IS RIGHT"". I had hoped to get a CD version to replace my very worn LP. Unfortunately, this is not the same recording. The photo and text for the album title on this item should be corrected so others don't make the same mistake."
1,Had to read for school,"There are few books I read for school that I don't partially enjoy. This was the first exception. I hated this book! The character of the daughter is bratty and a control freak, while the grandfather seems to be to the daughter nothing more than a remembrance of the good old days. (...)The children are VERY stereotypical and they are always feeling sorry for themselves. Another thing I noticed, the plot seems to get nowhere: (...)"
4,It's a good reference book for day-by-day use,"This book is very important for the exotic animal practicioner. The division in species makes very easy to find the information required, and the charts are very useful. The book contains only necessary information, so the text is short and specific. Another good factor is the size and cover of the book, easy to carry."
4,ON THE DOLE,"This book whiled away a couple of days of a very rainy holiday in France. Normally I admire Golding more than I like him, but I greatly enjoyed this book although it's one of his lesser efforts. The hard-drinking, egotistical, talented and successful narrator (a novelist -- I have no idea whether there is any element of Golding himself in the character) is someone I found oddly sympathetic from a safe distance. Other characters in the book had every justification for taking another view of him -- other characters except one, that is, the one being his unspeakable would-be Sancho Panza Rick L. Tucker. Really Golding, like H. G. Wells, had just about every gift a novelist can have, even when he was only exercising it at half-power.The other thing this book did for me was to introduce me to what has become one of my very favourite wines. If that aspect interests you, but not to the extent of actually reading the book, exercise your arrowy mind on the title I have given this little review."
4,Gift,"Gave this as a gift. It replaced one that stopped working, person was very pleased with this item and uses it when the lights go off in this third world country we call Kansas"
1,need more information,description does not tell you what size re-chargeable batteries this required or about needing a replacement bulb and what size that will be. need mor information before buying this.
2,Cheap. Spend a bit more for something this important.,"We purchased two of these lanterns because we live in a remote area that frequently experiences power outages during the stormy months. Both lanterns arrived promptly, and we immediately plugged in the pair and let them remain in the outlet for a few weeks. When it came time to use them (during a power outage), one would not even turn on (in spite of the light that had remained on for that entire time showing that it was getting juice). Because we had heard such great things about these lanterns and have trusted the Coleman brand in the past, of course we had tossed all the packaging (making a return impossible - ugh!).The other one -- ho hum. The light that was emitted was nice and bright but the lantern itself feels very cheap and plasticy.We will spend more the next time around -- for something so important (be it for a camping trip or power outages: It's important to have light to see), we were silly to scrimp."
2,Not Good,"I purchased this lantern in 2007. On the two times that I used it, it worked perfectly. Now it doesn't work anymore. It's not the bulb that is faulty.When you plug the lantern into an electrical outlet, there is a tiny red light that comes on at the switch to let you know that it is either charging or ready to use. That light doesn't come on at all and the lamp doesn't work.Now would I buy another one? I don't think so. Regardless of how long I have had it, I still think is should be ready for me after only having 2 blackouts in 4 years. The Dorcy Industrial Lantern that I purchased in 2007 is still working wonderfully after 4 years."
5,Never need a body scrub again!,Makes my skin so soft!!!! I used to work at a spa and after I use this my skin feels like what it did when I would get deep exfoliating treatments. Way better than any scrub I've ever used & I've tried everything from The Body Shop to spa scrubs. A must buy!
1,"Vendor sent me the counterfeit version, not what I ordered","The photo and description of what I ordered are not what I received in the mail. The packaging look similar, but the vendor sent me a different brand, and it's made in China."
4,"Honestly, Amazing yet not","The first time I took a shower with this jewel, it felt amazing and my skin hadn't felt so smooth in a long long time. If you ever get to try this shower towel, the texture is very delicate, intricate, and rough, but not too rough at the same time.It's genius; so many tiny woven patterns to flush out all your dirty little pores on your body's skin. However, I'll warn you that you shouldn't use it too hard. If you use it tightly against your skin, your skin will become red rather quickly and you would basically be scratching and irritating your skin.Cheers to a clean shower!"
5,nylon wash cloth,"Have used this product for many years, usually have to search for it in Asian food stores. Nice to find it online"
1,Not even close,This is not even a salux product. Just some cheap knock off brand mad in china. Don't even think about buying it. Just hit the back button a few times to get away from this dreadful product. Will never buy things from the vender again. It wasn't even made in japan as indicated but from china. This is a horribly product that i shouldn't have even buy it. Words cannot express my anger at the moment and an angry customer is not a repeating customer.
5,I am sold,My entire life I have just used a standard bar of soap in the shower but saw this recommended on a site that I visit regularly. Wow was I surprised by what a difference it made. It cut the time to lather soap up and scrub my body by about 80% and I felt cleaner after using it due to the exfoliating effect. I will definitely be purchasing more after this one wears out.
2,Not as good as Salux,"When I bought this there was nothing to indicate that it was the Chinese knockoff, Leyjie. When it came I really liked it, but it did look cheaply made and a little rough to use. When I actually got the real Salux, I realized just how much of a difference there was between the two. The Leyjie is thinner, lighter with cheaply sewn seams. It also more abrasive and produces less lather than the original. If you aren't sure which one you have look on the pack to see where it's made. Salux is made in Japan, Leyjie is made in China and the Salux washcloth has the logo sewn into the seam as well. The bottom line is that the Leyjie is too expensive for what you're given."
1,UGH. Not a salux.,I purchased this quicly after seeing the product advertised was a Salux. I bought two of them to give as gift.. Horrible.. HORRIBLE quality Leyjie versions arrived. Maybe I could try this on my back.. But I would be too embarassed to give something so rough to a friend or family member. Dissapointing.
1,cheap tricks,"why are they sending Leyjie knock-offs. this isnt what i paid for! sorry ... i thought that when your order slip says one thing, the product is supposed to be the same thing."
1,Received chinese knockoff,"The Japanese Salux washcloth is amazing! I buy them all the time for myself and gifts.Can't beat the way it makes your skin feel!Unfortunately what I received with this order was the Chinese knockoff Leyijie brand,which is horrible! Is nothing like the real thing in results, quality and feel. Thiswas supposed to be a gift and now have to wait and go through the whole process ofreturn and refund. Will buy straight from Salux dealer in the future."
5,Great cloths,I use this cloth every day to help eliminate flaking from dry skin. I follow ny shower with heavy moisturizer.
5,A must have for fans of Colombian music,"This great work is definitely a must have for fans of colombian music. There is a clear influence from Carlos Vives, as well as the beats of the northern colombian coast.It would be great if this artist became better known, as most of the tracks in this CD would make great radio hits in spanish speaking stations across the U.S. and Latin America."
5,Following the footsteps of Carlos Vives......,"This is a great album a must to have for fans of Colombian music!! and a lot of people don't know this but Ciclon belongs to Gaira Musica Local, Carlos Vives production company..that's why the sounds and rithms are so familiar!! Yes,Vives not only is a great artis but he also open doors for new ones to come..."
3,Only if you're a real Roy Rogers fan,"I am a huge Roy Rogers fan and try to buy anything that is about him, books, CDs, movies, etc. This is a children's book that I had as a child and was lost in several moves my family made. It was a replacement of a time long lost in today's world."
2,Good for complete fitness novices,"If you want to get in shape, but have no idea how to do so and are too embarrassed to go to a gym, then this book is for you.The book begins by having the reader take a self-assessment test wich is composed of a 1-mile walk/run, push-ups, and toe touch. Don't feel bad if you can't do any of the above, the book covers that situation. From there, in a user-friendly, color-coded format, the book helps you design a program that fits your needs.I bought the book thinking it would help me design a weight-training program for myself. It isn't that advanced. All of the resistance training it contains can be performed sith just your body weight and some common household items (such as water bottles).For a complete novice, this is where to begin. If, like me, you're a little more advanced, but want help in setting up a weight-lifting program, then I recommend Weight Training Steps to Success by Baechle and Groves."
2,mostly fiction,"You can get a copy of the bible for a buck in thedollar store, Read Your bible, prey 4 times a day.Keep asking Chirst to come into Your heart and HeWill. For God loved the world so much that Godgave it his only son. Remember Chirst Dying onthe Cross for the sins of Man."
4,Sony A/V receiver,"Sony STR-DA3200ES 7.1 Channel Surround Sound A/V Receiversounds great, Setup was time consuming and for the price should have more HDMI inputs!"
4,Christmas Present,This is a great product but not all the pieces matched up and was a little difficult to put together by myself.
1,Black - Not as pictured!,"The picture looks more ""wood"" colored almost cherry. When the product arrived it was black. Assembly was easy with included wrench. Reminded me of putting Ikea furniture together back in college.Cheap wood and not worth the price. Stay away!"
3,Decent at best.,"This item is decent at best. Flimsy build, cheap wood. Frame of the mirror was split apart.Drawer detaches if pulled all the way. Construction was fairly simple. Shipping and delivery were prompt.If this set up wasn't temporary for me i would return it in a heart beat.I recommend looking for a different one.Sorry to the sellers."
5,quality product,This valet looks great and was very easy to assemble. It is good quality for the money and I use it to hold my husband's clothes daily.
5,looks good,Me and my mother ordered this for my brother for christmas and we think he will like it just wished it was in blue ray
2,Not the brightest,"Something about the beam......something about the color of the beam....something about the lack of luminescence.....sorry, not the best light in the bunch."
2,The beam is not focused,"It was light when there was dark but, thats it. I liked that it was hands free but in comparison to my hand held flashlight it was dim. We bought two I wish we bought none."
5,Very doog,It came very fast and in it surprised me. Thanks very much for the eficience. I was looking for this book for a very long time.
5,"Shirley Temple's First, and Best","Most of Shirley Temple's films are so corny, you wonder how one release kept leading to yet another. ""Little Miss Marker"", which was remade many times over the years, is the easy answer. It was Shirley's first movie and, yes, she's an orphan from the very start. But thanks to Damon Runyan, a wonderful cast led by Adolph Menjou, and a very original story line (again, thank you Mr. Runyan), the start of the Shirley Temple series is a comical, off-beat delight that surpasses the distilled maple syrup of her later efforts, enjoyable though they may be. Only in the early thirties would you find such a movie as this, and in no other film does the neat and dapper Adolph Menjou play such an unrepentant, but soft-hearted, slob (seeing this alone is worth the price of the movie). It would be great if Hollywood had not lost the knack for making films like this. If you don't like Shirley Temple that much, but you'd like to know what all the noise was about, you'll like this one."
4,Little Miss Marker made Millions!,"Little Miss Marker has Shirley Temple as the star character.A child thrown about by a bunch of gangsters Temple wins the heart of Adolph. This is temple's first role and from the start she's an orphan. Dorothy Dell is great with Temple in this movie. After a while you see Shirley has changed a bit saying things like ""Scram ""and ""Not Tellin"" this movie is cute and when she gets thrown of Dream Prince you get all scared. Remember Temple did her own stunts,pretty good for a 6 year old! She doesn't sing or dance much in this movie but she shows of she's an actress . Pretty cute. I recomend this movie,to all the Temple fans who forgot she could act! and to anyone else"
2,Not especially accurate in my view,"This book was recommended to me somewhere along the way, but I found it not to be especially accurate. It has all of the transiting aspects with a few sentences after them. Some of the interpretations are bizarre. Not entirely useless, but I'd personally rate it with a C."
3,agree with previous reviewer on inaccuracy of transit interpretations,"some of the interpretations are quite inaccurate in my opinion and dont match with other books interpretations of same aspects. However,,some are very accurate and give extra details that pinpoint them better than other books.so i rate it a C + ."
2,teaching is subtle; this book is not,This was a required text at my Teachers' College. I found little of value in this book. It is painful to read. It studies the obvious in exquisite detail while precious little attention is paid to important issues and strategies. Could some teachers' college prof somewhere please include some thoughtful material in their reading list?
4,I love small & Mighty,"I love the fact that the detergent comes in such a small bottle and has done a very good job on my clothes. I have not used it alot yet, but right now, I would buy it again. The price is reasonable, but just a little expensive for me."
4,WORKS FINE,"I have been using this product for a little over 2 weeks and I have found it to work just fine. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't tried it yet on a really tough stain, but so far for my regular laundry I have no complaints."
2,Poor Quality,"This chair starts out as a nice concept and does enable my 17 month old son to eat at the dinner table with the rest of the family. It is however, wobbly after assembly. The hardware can easily be stripped during assembly as it is trial and error getting the seat and foot rest positioned exactly right to accommodate your child. It is suppose to be fully adjustable and grow with your child but how can you do this if the hardware strips out after initial set up. How about real screws and no allen wrenches. The leg partition strap is not really useful and my son can easily climb in and out. It needs a better restraining system. The seat and back cushions are also useless as they just get filthy and slide around. They can be washed but I just elected to not use them after the first day of use. I would recommend trying a different brand."
4,Overall a great buy,"This product was a good buy b/c it has a good reasonable price and can be used for years! While it doesn't have the quality of the Stokke, I think it compares well. I am under 150lbs myself, so once my child is done with it I will be able to use myself- you can't beat that for just over $100. The Stokke runs much more and offers the ability- to use from toddler to adult. The only problem with this one is the wood quality is not great- you have to unscrew the sides a bit to move the seat and it split a little while putting it together... but in that... you get what you pay for. So overall, we saved a lot of money buying this one and it still works great."
4,"The screws are okay, it's the allen wrench that's the problem","Other reviews comment on the screws being stripped easily and ours would have been too except I noticed the allen wrench they provided was too small and thus slipping and we had a set with one that fit much better and made it easy to manage the screws. I'd say don't worry about the pads, they just get dirty anyway and we don't use them. The quality of the platforms isn't the best but is good enough. We love the chair."
3,Nice Enough High Chair For Your Little One,"I bought this high chair from Amazon.com and I got a very good deal, seeing that other high chairs like this can go for a lot more money, I was pleased. My little one loves this chair now that she is one year old. I first bought it for her when she was only 6 months old. She wasn't too sure about it at first. The backrest was too short for her back to rest up against, but we adjusted the seat and the footrest to accomodate her size. My only gripe with this high chair is that it doesn't come with a tray attachment. But we can push her up to the table when we eat and she just uses the table top. It was very easy to put together. We now love this chair, it grew on us in the past 6 months!"
2,flaws in high chair,"Primo high chair does not fit a chunky baby, the lamination is not holding up and I am disappointed in it as I loved the look of it. The height for the baby at the table is way off, so my daughter had to purchase another high chair for her baby. I am going to make some adjustments and hope it will serve as an ocassional use chair here at my house instead of daily use by a growing baby."
1,Good At First but then Falls Apart,"We got this chair for our 3 yr old and were very happy with it at first. But like other reviewers the hardware comes lose and it falls apart after awhile. We ended up losing parts and the customer service is awful. We really only got 6 months of use out of it. She really loved the chair and asks for a new one that doesn't fall apart. It was a waste of money and I wish I had saved my money and put it towards a similar style chair that would have cost more but been better quaility. I think they shouldn't even be selling it, I feel like I got ripped off."
1,DO NOT BUY,"First shipment was bad! Rusted bolts, etc. Nothing fits right. Smells. Just poor quality.Hoping for a better one but second one was no better.Returning both.First one has extra slot for the wood seat panel. Do not waste your time and start your allergic reaction due to the dust and smell."
2,fell backward,"My daughter used from 1 year old. Now, she is 3 years old. It's okay. However, when she was 1 year old, she fell backward several times by kicking the table. So, we always step on the base to prevent her from falling backward. I think the reason why the base bar is too short. Except it, we like this chair. It's stable and easy to change the height."
1,"Poor quality, poor safety","We received this chair as a gift and started using it when my son turned six months. He is now eight months and I am shopping for a better highchair. I didn't have any trouble putting it together and in the beginning it seemed fine. Now that my son is getting bigger and more mobile this chair is a safety hazard. He can turn completely around and possibly slip out the back. He has very chubby thighs, so I had to lower the seat to get him in and out easily but now he could slip backwards out of the chair. I can't take my eyes off him for a second while using this chair. Sometimes I stand him next to the chair and put the Cheerios on the seat for him to eat because that is safer than sitting him in the chair!The chair itself is falling apart after 2 months use. It's too low for our table and our baby sits with his nose at the edge of the table during meals. Since there is no tray food drips all over the chair and floor."
3,OK for the price,The product arrived very timely but was missing 2 screws & a hexnut. We had to go to a local hardware store to fit the piece. The handy tool provided with the screws didn't fit all of them but we made it work. Let's hope that the quality holds up against my 2 1/2 year old!
1,Not Safe!,"PRI Deluxe Easy Chair (Natural Birch wood color)Not safe, my child was able to kick her self back in this chair by pushing off the table. She fell backward and hit her head on the hard floor. This is a poor design as per safety; the back legs need to go further back to be more stable. I am returning mine ASAP."
1,THANKFULLY I READ THE REVIEWS!!,"Thankfully I have read the reviews for this product and I will not be purchasing this item! I almost didn't read the reviews and thought ""Wow! This is a great price and the chair looks fab."" From reading the reviews I believe I have saved myself a great deal of stress assembling the chair as well as my son from possibly falling out of the chair and injuring himself.Thank you to everyone who wrote an honest review. I definitely won't purchase this product!!"
1,PRIMO De Luxe Easy Chair,This was a terrible purchase. The thing was so completely warpped that it could not be put together at all. The best thing to do with it is to take it out and drown it!
2,Bunk,"I would say it was a bunch of hogwash but would everyone know what I meant. Anyway, use your imagination instead of buying this book. I am a nurse and know a heck of a lot more than this writer. Bunch of bunk. Buy an acupressure and reflexology chart and have a glass of wine and a good time trying this and that."
3,"it is good, but too repetitive...","it is that kind of book that go around the same point over and over again but ""from"" different points of view.It is good, it teaches you, but it could be written shorter.The pressure points are almost the same through the book; what change is that the author gives you like a manual of how to do it for every stage.I think should be more!!.."
2,Too pornographic,"While some reviewers say the book is done in ""good taste"", I say it definitely is VERY pornographic. There is page after page of nude couples in sexual position; every body part exposed entirely. Personally, I'd prefer illustrations for such a thing to be drawn out, or use a computer generated model w/ a lot less detail or such.It seemed to be a lot about trying new positions too...Holding onto your spouse's pressure point for a period too.... seemed awfully.... clinical.I think I prefer just to find those points naturally over the years; which we have been doing.... and leave the clinical side & the pornographic side out of our marriage.-Just my opinion."
4,Overdue scholarly book on polka music is great,"Excellent scholarly book on polka music, concentrating predominantly on the Polish style, although one chapter is devoted to the Slovenian-American-style. This book along with Victor Green's ""A Passion for Polka"" mark two MUST READS for any serious polka aficianado/scholar."
5,"Great Band, Great Music","You can compare these guys to a lot of truly great contempory rock acts...REM, Interpol, The New Pornographers, Wilco. I think they speak for themselves. And nowhere better than on this one. Intense but focused energy, solid alt rock grooves, self-effacing humor in the lyrics, and the boldness to occasionally open up the sound into arena-rock land. They're a phenomenal live act, and I'm thrilled they're putting their best feet forward on Slow Politics. Unabashedly Recommended."
4,Easy and important book,"This is a simple book, but very important in doctrine context. The plot is no complicate, but it helps to understand the theme in an easy way. Most people know that predestination, election, reprobation, is the motif or subject in the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, and they also know that in the pulpit many pastors hid the utility of his exposition. However, reading this novel means to refresh this important concept for your soul, and at this point it is not fiction. I am not a Baptist, but mere Christian loving God' sovereignty, and I enjoy verbalizing about."
3,Way too much concentration on temples,"The DVD is okay, but it has far too much concentration on temples and not enough on sight-seeing. The DVD consisted of about 60% temples and Buddhism, 10% Taiwanese Aborgines and only 30% on sight-seeing attactions. In my opinion, could have been done much better."
3,Run Solo and Kurayakin Run!,"Ok offering to the series...enjoyable, but does not make that much sense. The gold cross is not built in that much to the plot...but fits the bill."
4,A Funny book for people of all ages.,"A sick dog, A broken ankle, and a dog that was attacked and almost killed, believe or not these are the main events of one of the funniest books ever written. There is a dog named Hank he is head of ranch security at a ranch. He always does dumb things that get him hurt or in trouble with his owner. One of the things he does is eat bacon grease and becomes very sick. But when he tries to do something nice it always seems to backfire and he ends up getting in trouble. If you own a dog it really makes you think how you treat your dog and if you ever talk to your dog. IF you are an adult looking for a fast read or a kid looking to have fun I guarantee you will laugh with this book."
4,A saddle haunt,"A good intriguing book that can grab many readers attention. If youi like killer stud horses, this is the book for you.Review by: Sara age 10"
4,"Christopher Cox's wonderful review of ""HANK THE COWDOG""",Hank the Cowdog is a series of books.I have chosen one. It is called the one-eyed killer stud horse. I suggest you read it because it is a real good book. It has black and white pictures in the book. The first few chapters are really funny.
4,How I found Blenheim on the map,"I realised that the War of the Austrian succession was a gap in my historical knowledge. The book was perfect in filling in this blind spot. I would have liked more maps especially of the marches and the Dutch possessions and a list of the main characters and their functions separate from the index,rather like the credits to a film! However I would recommend this book both to those who like reading history for fun and those who like historical novels."
2,A very pro-English point of view,Spencer adds little to the literature about Marlborough. His discussion of the international politics of the age is so biased as to make the book worthless. Read Chandler for a better discussion of this topic.
4,Highly Recommended,The CD is a very good presentation of Peter White's ability to interpret some of the popular recordings both contemporary and early works.
4,Foxman,"Peter white does everything well , He is very diverse , he has a song for every mood which is why you buy more than one of his cd's !"
5,Guitar candy for the ears,"I loved this cd. Peter White's music is easy jazz at its best. He includes lively tunes and also, slow romantic ones as well. His talent with the guitar brings you hours of enjoyable listening at home, work, or on the road. This is a must buy."
2,Not My Favorite,"As a long-time Peter White fan, I try to catch his concerts and keep up with his records. Unfortunately, this is one of his weakest efforts, far below ""Confidential"" and the Christmas album. The song selection here, pop favorites such as ""Mr. Magic"" and others, is the problem. Peter plays these straight down the middle, displaying little improvisational creativity or passion. Strictly dentist office music here."
4,Peter White's latest:,"I own and enjoy all of Peter's albums. If I had to inject anything negative, the last two albums: ""Confidential"" and ""Playin' Favorites"" are just a bit too funky for my taste. My leanings are towards the earlier releases, smoother and more easygoing."
3,Not my favorites!,"It's hard for me to give a Peter White cd 3 stars- he is my favorite jazz artist, and I have almost all his cd's- but that is what I'm doing. The guitar playing is flawless, and many songs on the cd deserve 5 stars, but I don't think the vocals on ""Deja Vu"" and a few other songs add anything to the songs- they detract from Peter's fabulous guitar playing. The song ""Mister Magic"" doesn't seem to belong on this cd, I personally can't stand this hyper, crazy song.I listen to jazz to relax. I have never liked the vocals on these cd's. I wish they'd keep them purely instrumental. I much preferred Peter's candlelight vol. 2 cd of greatest hits.On the plus side, ""What does it take to win your love"" and ""Sunny"" are standouts."
4,Another Winner,"Peter White is one of the best smooth guitar playing artist around. You can feel his sensual strokes on every string he strikes. Every one of his cd's gets progressively better. Although his album ""Glow"" is my favorite,this one will not be caught in the back seat of my ride. Cuts like Mister Magic, Crazy Love and What Does it Takes to Win your Love makes the album worth having alone. If you like smooth jazz guitar, check-out this piece of ear-candy and enjoy the flavor. You will not be disappointed...."
1,Beeps randomly,It will beep randomly. You really need to get close to the transmitting device. I had to get 1-2 inches away from my Wi-Fi router. I don't consider it effective.
5,An excellent overview of this fascinating topic,"This book is astoundingly interesting, attempting to tell the story of a people long ago vanished. The historical and archeological information is well grounded and the book is an exciting read. This hard to find gem is definitely worth a look."
4,"Low On Gore, High On Suspense!","Anyone who's watched enough Lamberto Bava movies knows that some of his best are actually gore-free. Take Macabre, or in this instance, Until Death. (For an Italian made-for-TV movie) It has great acting,some surprisingly competent writing, and another great score by Simon Boswell. There are moments of genuine tension and anxiety (though these are often diluted by some not-so-effective scare scenes) Once again, it's no Demons (or Demons 2!), but it does stand on it's own, especially when compared to the campy Dinner with a Vampire or the kiddie-horror awfulness of Graveyard Disturbance (though I must admit they ARE guilty pleasures....)"
2,Quality going down,"I used to like the thinkpad products, but their quality has deteriorated badly. For the price I would go with Toshiba or even Acer. I've had nothing but problems, most of which could be traced back to the Lenovo-installed software, which cannot be disabled. The sound card stops working periodically and requires a reboot. Lots of similar problems."
5,"a GREAT kitchen TV, especially for price","I don't get what some of the other reviewers are saying. We have purchased two of these TVs. The first in 2002 and the second in 2004. We liked the first one so much, we bought a second one as a gift for our son and daughter-in-law. Only problem is that after about a year, both of us have accidentally pushed the power button into the TV! But we can still turn it off and on with the remote. We really like ours and will definitely look for the same brand when this one ultimately wears out."
1,Save your money ...your time is more important,A cute and promising little unit....but it doesn't fit under depth of the counter and it sticks out about 1 1/2 inch. The worst thing is that the auto scan for channels doesn't work....channel 10 may be channel 51 and the tuning manually takes hours. I'm very disappointed with the set up.
1,information not disclosed,"The company doesn't tell you ahead of time that this product will ONLY work with analog cable (not digital, like Comcast). They wait until after you buy it, hook it up, and call tech support to let them know that you can't seem to get any channels through the autoscan. After finally reaching customer service, I was told that it just won't work, and they don't have any kind of adapter or anything for digital cable. It really annoys me that companies don't find it necessary to disclose information that would cut down on frustration and disappointment. I gave this as a gift and felt awful that it would not work. I would hesitate to buy GPX products after this."
1,This Kessinger edition is a joke,"Don't bother buying this edition unless you are absolutely desperate. It has abysmal, distracting typos or formatting problems on every page. You might as well print out the etext available online, go to Kinkos, and have it bound.[...]"
1,Release JLU in Full-Season DVD sets!,"As many have said before me, this series is top-notch, A+ work. We just need it released in full-season DVD sets for crissakes!"
2,Needs more episodes...and better features,"The DVD is phenomenally dissapointing. The WB DCU DVDs have traditionally had at least 6 episodes on them, sometimes more, yet for some reason this one only has 3...and not even in their order of production. It's missing ""For the Man Who Has Everything"" (which comes before ""Hawk & Dove"").The Special Features are sparse and annoying. Typical cut and paste schlock without any of the commentaries or interviews that have made the Justice League, Batman, and Superman disc sets so amusing.The only reason this set gets more than 1 star is because the three episodes on it are decent episodes, so it at least provides SOME amusement."
1,Give us some more episodes!,"Justice league Unlimited is a great show no doubt,BUT to sell us a DVD with only three episodes? Now that's pretty low,especially considering all the good material that can fit unto a DVD! The whole first season could and should have been put unto that DVD! Not only did they only give us three episodes,but they had to put the three worst episodes! Guys give us a break! I waited two months for this DVD,but I did'nt buy it when I saw what it came with! People don't waste your money,wait for the whole season to be released or just do use the good old VCR!"
1,Same old song,"Apparently you have to give one star. I suppose it deserves that for attempting to deliver what customers really want.Anyway, I just pre ordered Batman the Animated Series volume 3. It ships May 24, 2005. Can't wait to get it. It will round out my collection of Batman TAS and the single volume of Superman TAS. It will sit on the shelf right next to the animated Batman movies. I have spent well over $150 for the collection. I have the money and the interest. Take a hint already.Fortunately, I have recorded all of the episodes on DVD. If they don't want my money, that is OK. I already have them."
1,Wake Up You Guys At The WB!,"Here I am, wanting to spend money on box sets of Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, and/or Batman Beyond DVDs. And what do the ""brains"" at the WB do, give us a weak DVD of three 30 minute Justice League Unlimited episodes. What are you affraid of? We buy this stuff for our kids. Give the adults what they want and we will buy them for our kids. Anybody listening at the WB? E-mail me skidogsports@hotmail.com"
2,"Not that bad, but should have been better","Of course I preferred the complete season if it was available. It is not bad for a season start, but the publisher should have selected better episodes for this package."
1,Not even tempted,"I prefer to see season 1, season 2 etc. If I buy this than why would I want to be a season and have duplicate episodes. I also think it would be a good idea to have a down loadable file sample of movies or TV shows."
1,We Want Seasoned Sets!!,"I just can't believe that Warner Bros. still are putting out 3 episodes at a time. This is an incredible series but it's not getting the type of DVD justice it deserves. Sadly, the Justice League gets no justice!! We fans demand seasoned sets to be released."
1,WB Get it together! Don't buy this disk!,"Honestly, I have no idea what WB is thinking! Putting a measly three episodes on one DVD is just a greedy and obnoxious way to irritate fans of the series. ATTENTION WB executives either put out the entire series season by season onto DVD or just stop all together. This is just crummy, cheap, and annoying!"
1,It's really a shame ...,"This is one of the worse cases of price-gouging I've seen in quite a while.Personally, I LOVE the JLU tv show and I wouldn't think twice to pick up a box set (if they'd just release one). However, to make fans of the show buy it (basically) episode-by-episode, is really ridiculous.I'm sure there'll be a box set at some point, you'd do better to save your money until then. If you need a fix in the meantime, these discs would make better rentals."
1,Give us fans Boxed Sets!,"WB is doing a very, very poor job with the DVD release of this GREAT, GREAT, GREAT show! They don't realize that the fan base for justice league isn't kids! WE WANT COMPLETE SEASON BOXED SETS! Do not waste your money on this and save it until WB caves in and releases complete seasons."
1,Warner Bros. just doesn't get it.,It's amazing how WB execs simply refuse to cash in on the season set phenomenon. This disc is pure garbage in terms of content and an insult to fans who are willing to spend money on their product but simply aren't given anything worth buying. Only 3 episodes? I am boycotting WB until they give the public season sets or at least a better value for our hard earned disposable income.
1,A time to complain,After finding out the release style the WB has for the JLU series I felt I had to complain in as many places as possible. It was very nice to see the Starcrossed series released in wide screen format all together...but to remarket this series in a way that loses the majority of its fanbase?...stop that!
1,pink? really?!,i got these for birthday presents for my nephews because i bought them the system this goes with. they sent me a pink one! pink isnt even in the picture!! you cant choose what colors you want so its hit or miss. it was to close to the birthday party to return the pink one so i had to give it to him anyway. i wouldnt order this again. ever.
1,Worst. Trick. Ever.,"I bought this for my 10-year-old son. We thought it includes a GBA, but it didn't. I spent $11.00 on this. I would never buy this thing again. I'm ordering game systems from my local stores from now on."
3,Crowley Sweatshirt,"I thought this sweatshirt was gray (looks gray in the picture), but it's actually white. The graphics are colorful and detailed, but the back is plain. It's a nice, warm sweatshirt."
1,Not what I expected,"I searched Amazon for satin pillowcases because my belief was satin was supposed to good for the hair (prevent bedhead) and skin. These pillowcases are 100% polyester and although they appear nice, smooth, and shiny, I feel instant static in my hair when I lay down and I wake up looking just as disheveled as I do when I use my flannel pillowcases. So if the purpose of purchasing these pillowcases is the same as mine...these are not for you."
1,Won't last long,Pillow case are great but the sheets give fuzz balls in the center of the sheets and not smooth not a good buy
1,Not as Described,"Item (Smoke Blue Scent-Sation Charmeuse Satin Pillowcase Pair) was listed as a 300 thread count pillowcase set, yet when it arrived, it was a 230 tc set. Item was returned for full refund. Lacquer Red color of same product was received as described."
2,False advertizing?,You look at the picture and see two sheets and two pillowcases.When you read the fine print its just two pillowcases. I was rather put out when I received only two pillowcases for so much money. I thought it was a good bargain when I bought it only to discover it was not what the picture demonstrated. I'm sure they're nice but I just returned them unopened. Too rich for my blood.
1,"Larger than necesary, poor range.","I'm returning this unit. It's too large to truly be flexible with a Pocket PC, the range is very limited, and it requires a Compact Flash II slot while others only require a CF I. I'm going to purchase the Socket Low Power CF card instead."
2,this book is for entertainment purposes only,"To be honest this book isnt much of anything. Good thing it was cheap. This book can give you some good lines to say but all it does is give insight into a ghetto society. If you grew up in certain neighborhoods this book will not tell you anything you dont already know. there is no science into mackin women and you cant put it into words and write a book. The only thing this book is, is a hustle. This is how the author's mack, his way of makin money off people who want more women or to be a pimp or whatever of the sort. Im not mad at him. I may buy the next book to see what it says out of curiosity but wont take it seriously."
5,Keepin' your game tight,"Most playa's around the world know most or all of the game that was brought up it this book. Thanks to Tariq Nasheed, you can actually see what you are doing, and point out what he said and make your game better. I have always been a brotha' with no problems getting a woman of my choice but now, I find it so much smoother and easier to do it. I would suggest any old school player or new school playa to brush up with this book and make it easy on yourself."
2,review over the art of mackin,"this book was far from wat i excepted, king flex has about two examples of gaming with women as to the book MYstery Method it gives you the whole game plan. In art of mackin theres not that much to learn.. i would recommend "" Mystery Method"" book over this book."
3,good 4 players,This is definetly a good book on how to get booty. This is not a good book on how to be a pimp. Its for players only. I'VE READ A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK THAT SAID THAT K-FLEX WAS A PIMP AND HES TEACHING IT IN THIS BOOK: THATS PURE B.S.HE AINT NO PIMP HES A PLAYA AND THIS BOOK IS NOT AGAINST WOMEN AT ALL. IN FACT IF U READ IT U WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN BETTER SO U WILL BE ABLE TO TREAT EM BETTER.If u a pimp dont mess with this book at all. this is for people that want ass. I want money.
3,"It was okay, but not all that.....",This book had a few true pointers but hey I don't think it was that good as some people claim. I wouldn't recommend this book.
5,Biaches n' hoes,"YO YO YO party people!! What is up in the hood?!?! Yo I just be finishin readin dis off da chain book... and let me tell ya it is for real is most dope shizzzznit I have ever read. It for real stepped my game up wit da ladies... they be all over me for serious. Yo I love dem ladies too... and I be pickin up some fine honeys after breezin through dis book. I be feelin dis book and any others dis brotha has to offer. I would back dis book up any day for da week, it has really helped me get my game in tip top shape. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK PLAYAS and PLAYETTES!"
3,Inquiring minds what to know,"The book was hilarious to say the least.I want to know is the female standing to the right of the guy seated, the former singer of Destiny's Child. I think her name is Farah."
1,Brotha Please,"As an African American woman, I am appalled that people still author and publish these types of books. Simply put, if you must read a book about ""how to mack"" then forget it...you'll never achieve that so-called status. It's a dubious achievement at best. How about books to teach young men how to get extra money for college or how to own their own businesses? I have read this book and I did not take this seriously, I looked at it as something similiar to Mad Magazine, a parody."
2,Its a hustle,"The game is to sold and not told, however what the author is selling here is not game, rather a bunch of drag from a ghetto mentality perspective. Trust me, I'm a black man, I know. If your looking to pull some hood chicks this book might give you a little insight, but if you want your game to be universaly recognized this book will teach you nothing. The only way truly build your game is to get out on the scene and gain experience. Contrary to what the author wants you to believe, not all men can be ""night club macks"". You are either born with a certain charisma or your not. You have to get in were you fit in in this world and once you find out who you are you can then zero in on the type of women whom your personality suits, and at that point you can begin to hone your skills. Buy this book if you want a good laugh, or to do some light hearted reading. But don't expect to light the city on fire after finishing it."
5,Suprised.....,"When I first heard about this book,I just knew that I would probably hate it.All the guys around my college campus treated the book like it was some sort of bible.I've seen the author K-Flex Nasheed on television shows and I've heard radio people talking about the book,but when I heard that K-Flex was the prototype for Denzel Washington's character in the movie ""Training Day"",I decided to finally break down and get the book for myself.To my surprise,i found myself agreeing to most of the stuff in the book.I was actually informative and insightful,and I highly recommend the book to all the female readers out there.This is one of the few books that really tell the truth about how women and men are."
5,Tested and Passed,Excellent book. A little corny at times but overall this dude is on point. Definitely worth the read for entertainment purposes alone. I wish I could have read this at 18. I know some females that didn't believe his techniques would work. But I have practiced some of the theory and it works. I wasn't really feelin his scripts for layin rap on the ladies but I am east coast and he's on the west. If nothing else Tariq shows that he understands the female mind even better then females understand themselves.
4,windtunnel is working well for me,"Really like this machine. Only dislike it the dirt cup. I live on a ranch which tends to bring lots of dirt in, have a wood and coal stove...I have to dump the dirt cup real often or the suction level goes way down. Other than that, it is the best vacuum I've had since a Rainbow."
1,Not as good as the one I already had.,I had a Windtunnel that had a bag. Wore it out and ordered this one that is bagless. It does not seem to have any suction power through the hose attachments. I was disappointed in its performance. Don't know what to do about it now..
5,Fantasic for the Price,"I have to admit this is my third hoover windtunnel and I'm a fan and have been for awile. My last 2 windtunnels ended up with my ex, and let me tell you I did not realize how much I missed this Hoover, This unit has outstanding performance and It is very reasonably priced. I would recommend this to any of my friends and family......."
1,recommend you keep shopping,Bought it - worked fine for about oh say 2 months. Then the long cartridge filter (the one that looks like an automobile air cleaner filter) needed replacement because despite thoroughly washing it after each use it begins to smell like a football locker room after awhile. Think you can find that filter anywhere closeby - not! Scoured the country. Everyone sells the vacuum but no one sells this filter. Finally had to special order it via a Hoover Distributer in the closest metro area.There's more - - About two days after purchasing it I found the same machine about... cheaper that where I bought it and it also included a... special attachment that the one I bought didn't have. Now the latest is that it has quit working altogether. Oh the motor runs and the power head bar twirls but there is no vacuum - you know sucking that makes the whole thing run correctly. Like I said - keep looking and scratch Hoover from your list.
2,made of cheese,"This is a childs toy with lots of fancy bells and whistles all made out of cheap plastic. The first time I changed the bag, one of the plastic tabs for the cover snapped off so now it has a rubber band around the front. The belt breaks frequently and it takes me 10 mins to get the new one on. Anything coarser than dust or hair it will leave in the carpet."
5,Worth the price!,"I have a cat and am VERY allergic to kitty litter. My old vacuum would grind up the litter and create a dust cloud in my living room. Thereafter, I would be unable to breathe. After vacuuming, I could not believe all the dirt, loose carpet fiber, and cat hair this vacuum picked up!!! I am breathing much easier since I got this vacuum. I highly recommend it!!! The hand tool is very powerful and cleans exceptionally well."
4,"Excellent cleaning, few faults","I purchased this vacuum based on other buyer's opinions, and I concur that this is an excellent product. By the weekend, I have zero enthusiasm to clean house, but this makes cleaning up a snap.The first time I used it, it sucked up a half canister of dirt in just one room. I was distressed at the amount of dirt that my old vacuum had left behind, but delighted at its efficiency. Unlike my old cannister, it didn't leave an odd ozone smell hanging in the room.The canister is easy to empty. The beater brush drives the vacuum forward, so moving forward is effortless. When assembling the handle, be sure to screw it on tight. I left a bit of play, and the connector to the on/off switch slipped."
4,Hoover U5750-900 Windtunnel Upright Vacuum Cleaner review,Great price and rapid delivery. Very happy with the price/performance of this vacuum. Really cleans well if you empty and clean the filters after use. A little loud and the brushes do not turn off when you use it set to hardwood floors.
5,It sucks like a ...,I've got a Pug dog and she sheds like crazy. I -thought- that my carpet was pretty free from her hair but this thing just sucks it up. ... I couldn't believe how much was actually on my floors. Emptied the canister without any trouble. Like it a lot.
3,Say no to bagless,"Suction is great, but it can get very messy when cleaning the filter. This will be the last bagless I will get. And what is up with the hose? It pops out with the slightest pull. I give up using the hand tools."
1,motor shot!!!!,"bought this item aug of 2001.moved in new condo labor day weekend and started using the machine. well....last weekend on saturday the vacuum started smoking and quit. even though IT WAS A YEAR TO THE DAY that it broke, i bought it a month before on sale and didnt use it until I moved in. $ 250.00 down the drain and hoover wont work with me. Well....my mother always had a hoover and i liked them also. But after this i wont be buying one and neither will anyone else I know. Hoover just lost a some major business. TOOOOOO BAD. Gotta keep ur customers happy."
2,Good Vacuum but use caution,"This vacuum is as good as can be expected for a new vacuum, although I have two burns in my carpet resulting from the use of the attachments. You may want to reconsider if your home is not one that will enable you to rest the vacuum on a non-carpeted area at all times while using the attachments. Per a technician, the only way to assure this does not happen is to NOT leave the vacuum running on carpeting while using the attachments. The company clearly states in the manual that leaving the vacuum running on the stairs while using attachments ""may cause extensive wear and tear"" but they do not tell you that it may burn a whole."
2,Good At First,I have a 2&4 year old and Great Danes. I vacuume everyday. This vacuume does a Great job if you empty the canister and replace the hepa filter everyday. Other than that is SUCKS in a bad way. It smells like rubber everytime. I spend 35.00 a month replacing the hepa filter. I know I expect alot out of a Vacuume but trust me this is not the one. Spend more money and be happy. My mo just bought the Animal made by Dyson. Holly Cow this is the best thing I have ever see. I know it is alot of money but if you need something that will make your carpet CLEAN. This is the one. I am saving to go buy it. Oh yeah I have only had this Hoover for a year!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Windtunnel performance little more than hot air,"My wife and I happily purchased the Hoover U5750-900 Windtunnel Upright Vacuum Cleaner from Amazon in October of 2001. We paid $279, clearly a tad more (unhappily) than it's selling for right now. But its cleaning power was highly praised in a leading consumer magazine. We used that machine perhaps a half hour a week for less than two years before the motor simply burned out. Our carpet was cleaned quite well thank you--briefly-- but so was our wallet--all too quickly it now seems. We have since learned that motor burnout is not uncommon with this product. Sad to say, neither is buyer burnout. We wouldn't even consider another Hoover product."
1,Very Disappointed,"We have only had this vacuum for about a year and a half. It worked well the first few months, but I soon learned that cleaning and emptying the filters was a pain. I could only vacuum my downstairs then clean the filters, wait over night for them to dry then clean the upstairs. Never had to do that with the old one. Now, it has quit sucking (which is not good when you are talking about vacuums!) I've unscrewed everything, cleaned out every possible hole, and it still is not working very well. We have a long haired cat who causes a lot of our carpet dirt, but it never happened with my [other] vacuum! It seems that the dirt has to travel up too many pipes to get to the bagless part. This vacuum is a pain in the rear! I cannot believe we spent [$$$] on this thing! Sorry, I'm venting because I just got done taking the darn thing a part trying to unclog it AGAIN and it overheated and won't even turn on now."
2,Good for the first day-bagless vacs are a step backwards.,"This was great for about the first week that I bought it. It cleaned up stuff I never knew existed in my carpet. Then as the paper hepa filter began to get clogged with dust and other things it quickly lost suction. Banging it out frequently only worked for a while, then I had to purchase a new filter at $30. For the two years I've had this, I had to replace 2 filters a year. That equals $60. More then the $50 they claim you save annually by not buying bags.It also doesn't do hardwood very well, sending the debris all over the place. It is also incredibly heavy, so for elderly people or folks who can't lift heavy objects, it's not good.On the plus side the selection of attachments is very good, and it comes with an extra hose for long reaches. But as the filter gets filled and the vacuum loses suction you'll see the tools and wands work less and less well."
1,Disapointing,"I owned this vacuum for less than a year before I threw it out in the trash. We purchased a vacuum that was 1/3 the price and cleans our carpet 10 times better than the Windtunnel ever did. For me, the problem with the vacuum was the windtunnel seal -- it seems as if air was leaking out from the WindTunnel area, though our local Hoover service rep didn't think it was abnormal. Nonetheless, I've been much happier with my much cheaper vacuum."
3,Disappointed,"After using the same Hoover upright for over 15 years I decided to invest in a new one. Although the cleaning results are great, I'm on my third belt in less than 6 months. The first had to be replaced in less than 4 uses. I caught the edge of a rug and figured it was my bad. The second broke yesterday, twisted and caught around the drive..."
1,Clog Heaven!,Horrible design where dirt glogs easily and you can't get inside to clean! I am giving mine to the Salvation Army for a tax write-off and looking for a simple design I can unclog!
1,"Please, don't do it.","I purchased a Hoover Wind Tunnel Vac and a Hoover carpet cleaner at the same time based on Consumer Report recommendations. My mission now is to warn people to avoid any Hoover product. Parts continue to break off of both appliances and they perform very poorly. I took the fairly new vacuum to a local shop to be repaired and she explained that the current products ""ain't your mom's Hoover"". They're made in China and each year gets worse. They repair all makes and most are Hoovers. Please avoid. She said Simplicity is the only US brand anymore. Buyer beware."
2,"Windtunnels start well, but don't last","I've had two Hoover Windtunnels. The first one lasted two years, and the motor burned out. Sears told me it should have lasted longer. I bought another. It did last longer, maybe 4 years, before the motor butned out. But it lasted this long, in part, because I was taking it to a local vacuum storeand getting it repaired every so often. So now I'll probably get something more reliable, maybe a used vac to keep the price down."
2,Worked great at first.,"Worked great when we first bought it, It would work so well in fact that every time we would vacuum it would take up all the loose carpet fibers as well. after about 7 months the motor has started to smoke and it stopped picking up everything all together. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that intends on using it for longer than a year."
2,Ok at First . . .,"I researched vacuums, and going on consumer reports recommendation, I bought this vacuum. It worked great for the first few months picking up my dog's hair and anything else on the floor. It did feel like it was moving itself for the first month or so. Emptying the canister can be gross because you have to get the stuff out by hand sometimes. Cleaning the 2nd filter in the bathtub can be a little gross but when you do it works better, but every time you clean it, the performance gets worse quicker than the last time - I am feeling like I need to wash the filter after every room I clean. I have had this for a year and I am defintly looking for something with a longer life than this one for what I paid for it. I guss I'll give dyson a try . . . start saving!"
2,Insane,"Though I'm a very big fan of KAYAK, I think it's completely absurd to buy such an item at such prices. Are you crazy ???? It's not crazy, it's insane !"
3,"Screen says ""No Disc""","I bought this in Nov. 2007 and thoroughly enjoyed its continuous play of Christmas music in Dec. However, when I changed to my other CDs the problems began. The main problem is that even though it sounds like the CD is going back to the play position, I get a message saying ""No Disc"" and I hear an awful ratchety type sound. Since I had it more than a month, the Co. I bought it from wouldn't take it back and I had to take it to one of only two Pioneer repair centers in our state. The closest is an hour away. When I took it in, the repairman said he's seen a lot come in with the same problem. I hope Pioneer can take care of this problem!! I may not have mine back for three weeks. I'm hoping it will work fine after that!"
5,LOVE IT!,I bought this as a gift for my hubby. He loves it. The random feature is nice. Just put in the 25 CD's and you are good for endless hours! SUPER fast shipping! No complaints. Perfect!
5,I am Happy With This,My first package was dented and returned. They promptly sent a new one and it was expeditious. I love that this CD changer is continuous play and seems to have no problem with Mp3-copied CDs at all.
5,Perfect player for those still using CDs,"When my Sony 300CD carousel quit I was glad to find this Pioneer CD changer. With only 25 CDs, the holder remains stationary which eliminates one major problem with the Sony revolving carousel. The Pioneer is very easy to set up and use. I find not having a remote is not a problem as the controls are basic and easy to use. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to store several groups of CDs. With only 25 slots, grouping CDs is much simplier than having to use a keyboard entry system like the Sony 300."
4,25-Disk Changer,"I had a 18-disk Pioneer CD changer for about 15 years. I had picked it up as a floor model from an appliance store that was going out of business. I was a little apprehensive about buying a floor model, but the price was right. I could not have been happier with the performance. Lasted 15 years (and several moves) and just quit working a couple of month ago. I decided to go with another Pioneer for its replacement. I was very happy to see that I could get a 25 disk changer for under $100! So far, I have been happy with the purchase.One minor problem I had, though, was that I have 1 CD that is also a DVD on the flip side. I'm guessing that due to this, the disk is thicker than a normal CD. The changer does not handle this well--it gets stuck trying to load it and ends up stopping. So, I can't play this particular CD in the changer. So far, that is the only one I've had difficulty with."
3,Good and Bad,I like the Player but had trouble getting it to work properly at first and with no or very little help from Pioneer finally got it to work. Am satisfied and like the player but upset with Pioneer.
3,"Good Changer, Terrible Manual","The changer quality is great but I can't seem to get it to use the supposedly built-in 3 custom programs per the manual - it seems to want a remote button called ""disc set"" which the unit doesn't have. If anyone has gotten this to work please tell me how."
4,a very good multiple CD changer,This changes 25 CD's seamlessly. It is extremely easy to load and to switch one or two CD's. It's only lack is a remote. Be aware that you NEED an amplifier and speakers. This is not made specifically clear in the ads.
5,99 & 44/100ths Per cent Perfect,"I bought mine ten years ago, in December of 1998. Wow, has it been TEN YEARS since 1998?Anyway, this unit has performed perfectly and brilliantly. It's wonderful to load it up with 25 discs of blues, or 40s music, or the Beatles, etc, and just hit RANDOM. It's your own radio station, playing only what you like!The only drawback is the lack of a remote control. I have to get off my butt once every 25 discs, but who doesn't need the exercise?"
5,Pioneer FD-407 25Disk changerI am pleased,I wouldf rate this prodfuct as excellant. The random play feature is better than I experienced on my previous Sony changer2.
4,Pioneer 25-disc cd player,Product arrived unworkable *(would not load disks); I called Pioneer and fortunately there is a local repair shop that fixed it for free. It now works fine; but can't give it a top rating because of this defect that needed fixing.
3,I wish,I wish I would have known this product did not have a remote or even work with one Its great for what it is but kind of a pain to have to get up every time you want to make it do anything
5,Pioneer CD Changer,"The CD changer is exactly what I wanted, it is extremely easy to set up & use.Also, it was delivered so quickly, I was really surprised that it arrived when it did,"
5,Fabulous Value,I went from a 5 disc player to this 25 disc player! Absolutely love it!! It was also an incredible value!
1,return and exchange,the CD player had not worked consistently since we received it. we are in the process of returning it to exchange for another...will keep you posted.
5,Pioneer PD-F407 CD Changer,"Very easy to install, load and operate. 25 discs are just enough to have a good long-running mix of different types of music. I like the custom program feature. Lack of a disc/track title indidcator is not an issue as the unit is out of sight and we know who we're listening to when they're playing. Lack of a remote also not an issue as we usually just turn it on and let it run in the background. Nice that the appearacne matched the 20 year-old Pioneer components that we still have. Great unit for the price."
5,Don's review,ThePioneer PD-F407 25-Disc CD-File Changerprovides the flexibility to listen to a variety of music however you want. The random selection is great. The product was very easy to install. Even a caveman can do it. The sound quality through our home sound system is extraordinary.
4,Pioneer PD-F407 CD Player,Bought this player to replace a 400 disc changer. It is less bulky and much simpler to use. The only drawback is the lack of a remote to control its functions.
4,PIONEER PD-F407 25 Disc CD Player,"I bought this unit for my mom , because she has a pretty old but very reliable Sansui QR-6500 reciever. I wanted to get her some components to replace some that had worn out. She is very pleased with the system it performs beautifully. My own complaint is it didn't come with a remote but that is Pioneers problem not this shipper. I recieve this unit quickly and I am very satisfied with this companys handling and will do business with them in the future."
3,Great play but.....,The PD-407 is an awesome disc changer but there is one major item that could be there and should. A Remote. This model is not supplied with a remote there is a brother version of it that is the PD-507 and badabing it has a remote so if you plan on using the PD-407 with a Pioneer reciever which has a control out jack then it is for you but if you do not have that or do not feel like getting up to make your selections manually then go with the big brother version the PD-507. But overall for the buck dollars this product is worth it.
3,"So far, so good","The first one I received did not work, however Vann's was very helpful with the exchange process.I got the second one yesterday, and it works great. I love the ""Random"" mode whereby you can shuffle-play all 25 cd's."
1,It broke rather quickly,"The 25 disc mechanism is very mechanical, and it finally jammed and broke. Nice idea, but don't try it. And pretty clunky too."
2,Disappointed,"Looked forward to getting this cd player. Thought since refurbished to factory, etc. would be a good deal as I cannot get a new one. Doesn't work -- only will play first twelve then 13-25 indicates 'NO DISC"". Hope can get repaired -- I am confined to home due to disabilities and need my music."
4,Convenient,"This as a replacement for an older unit (PD-F507) that I've had for nearly 10 years. The new unit does not have a remote. I appreciate the memory features, program favorites and returns to the last song played when restarting.I have it on alot on weekends, so I know that it's durable. It's a great value!!"
4,Pioneer CD Player,"We are very, very satisfied and feel that we have received GREAT value so far from this purchase! It arrived very soon after we purchased it, in tip-top new condition. Very easy to use, very intuitive. No surprises---it was everything we expected."
2,maybe,this could be the one but if you need a remote no way it should clarifiy in product description that theres no remote.
2,Item Returned,I returned this item because I did not know that it was a component and I needed an amplifier to make it work. So I did not have a chance to try it out. I'm sure If I had the necessary equipment it would have been great. I liked the idea of playing 25 discs. I think it would have been helpful to mention that in the item discription.
2,25 cd changer,This wasn't the products fault I needed more equipment to operate this and didn't have it so I don't know how it works...I sent it back....
1,CD Player,"I am returning this item as it is not anything close to what I expected. However, in the past I have always been satisfied with purchases through Amazon so once I receive my refund, I will reorder a CD player that is more in line with what I really want and need.Thank you,Mary Anne DeLapp303-242-435653 Pennsylvania StreetDenver,CO 80203University of ColoradoDean's Office303-556-2624"
5,"excellent journalist, a true american patriot",fantastic book. moyers is an unbelievabel journalist and a true american citizen. he has served his country in government and in public life. a wonderful writer and excellent speaker.
1,"Rabid, lying paganism RUN AMOK","Listen to Chris Wallace's closing remarks on Bill Moyers on Fox News Sunday (8/26/07) and you will understand who and what we are dealing with in Bill Moyers - a radical, pagan, left wing, bomb throwing crazy!!!"
5,Great carpet extracter,"I purchased this extracter for my home. With two dogs, my carpet becomes dirty very quickly. The first day I received it, I cleaned my entire living room in one hour. The machine was easy to use and very effective at removing dirt from a carpet.I'm a housekeeping manager and I tried this machine at work. I was even more impressed than I was at home. The dirt this machine extracts is amazing. The carpets have never looked better. I ended up purchasing the commercial grade version of the carpet cleaner for my work site.I have used a lot of carpet cleaning methods and equipment. For home use or small areas (offices) this machine works great. I strongly recommend this product."
5,Great cleaner that has paid for itself many times over!,"We have saved a lot of money and people can't believe how great our carpet looks. We used to rent the steam cleaners from the grocery store, but now we can clean it well any timw we want and not have to worry about bringing it back to the store. Just watch out because all your relatives and friends will want to borrow it!"
1,Misleading Reviews or Just a Lemon???,"Having read the raving reviews here, I bought the Hoover Steamvac Widepath, and was very sadly disappointed. There was very little suction, the cleaning solution just dribbled out of the hand tool (no spray) and it was room temp. while the cleaning solution in the tank was over 150F. The machine put a lot of solution in the carpet and removed very little dirt or cleaning solution, carpets were wet for over a day. I promptly took this machine back for a refund."
1,SteamVac on hardfloors,My house primarily contains wood and tile floors. I have only two small rooms with carpet. I found the SteamVac out of the box came with two bottles of carpet cleaner and NO hardfloor cleaner. This annoyed me as I primarily wanted to use the SteamVac on my kitchen floor which is terrocota tile and the carpet cleaner states not to use on hard floors. I used the Steamvac first on my kitchen tiles. The brushes worked OK however my machine left pools of water on my floor. I had to let my floor dry overnight since there was so much water the machine was unable to suck up. My floor then had dirty water marks since the machine could not suck up most of the water. I was very disappointed with this result and will be going back to my mop and bucket to clean my kitchen floor. I then used the SteamVac on my carpeted rooms and the results were fine. It got rid of most stains. However I purchased this product to replace my mop and bucket. All in all not worth the $299 price tag!!!
5,Great Book,"This is a condensed version of Wesley's sermons in regard to the Holy Spirit. It is in updated language. The plus is there is a CD so you can listen to the sermons. The editor footnotes, so you can tell where the various parts came from. This is a good ""one source"" to either start one's collection, or be added to an existing. It is good for the scholar or the curious reader, to have in a concise product Wesley's thoughts on the Holy Spirit."
4,Gonna have a happy explorer,This is a great beginners scope.Highly recommended.The base is built well for the price & the magnification & lighting are enough to get a clear visual of any specimen placed on the glass.I also bought box sets of slides which gave my children hours of samples to examine.I would have given it a 5 but the accessory package included was covered in the blue dye.Better packaging needed for that.
5,Easy to use. works well. We love the product,Easy to use. Works well. My 10 year old loves it. I recommend this product for purchase and want to buy more slides.
4,Great first-time microscope,"My son received this for Christmas, and he thinks it's great. It's easy to set up and view different slides."
4,Great item for the price!,"This microscope is very impressive! My 7yr old really wanted one for Christmas, but we wanted one that would be durable and work well, and after reading reviews here, decided on this one. It is really fun to examine all kinds of things under it, and definitely educational. Hopefully we can continue to use it and learn from it for a very long time!"
4,fun,"I bought this for my 8 year old. He really liked it. Its sturdy enough. I wasn't blown away by the quality, but its cute and light. My kids like it."
4,Great for nine year old,This is perfect for my daughter. It is really bringing out the scientist in her and she is going around the house finding things to examine. The only con is that it is made in China.
3,Over priced,"I chose this microscope based on the reviews, and have decided it was a bit over priced for what it was packing...My Lab Duo-scope was missing its protective cover. I think Toys R us has a better deal with its accesories but the microscope provided sucks."
5,Hours of entertainment!,"I bought this for my daughter's eighth birthday. She asked for a microscope and after reading reviews, I chose this one. So far, we have really enjoyed it! It's easy to use, and works well. My daughter loves it! She's been looking for things to view EVERYWHERE and her friends even ask to play with it when they come to visit. Definitely worth the price! We bought an extra set of prepared slides, but you wouldn't need that, because you can have more fun finding things yourself! As far as durability, there is a degree of ""carefulness"" you have to teach, but completely appropriate for my 8-year-old."
2,Multiple problems,Ordered this microscope in late October to get a jump on Christmas online shopping. My son opened it at Christmas and we were disappointed to find it had a bad switch and there is a piece of debris blocking the highest magnification setting. Can't return for a refund since the 30 day return option expired long before Christmas. Next year I'll won't be shopping that early or that exclusively.
5,the best microscope,"This was given to an 8 year old as a christmas gift. She loves science and loves exploring her environment. The microscope is a nice quality. IT comes with a dust cover but no hard case. It's electronic and has a light bulb instead of a mirror which helps her a lot. It's not overly complicated but advanced enough to keep her entertained for a while. It does come with some not-so-child-friendly pieces that may need to be taken away from younger kids. She makes her own slides and loves looking at carpet fibers, gold flakes, grass, anything. She plays with this more than her video games and dolls. I recommend that you buy a microscope book for kids to go along with it. I used my old Biology book but she needs help with it. I also bought some additional slides to look at. I recommend this product for inquisititve kids and adults even."
4,Learning is fun,Bought this for my 7 yr old granddaughters. They absolutely love it. It seemed to be sturdy enough and should last a while if handled properly. It works great for the price and purpose of engaging little minds. Will purchase another one at Christmas for my new step granddaughters. I also bought the prepared slides and they were a big hit as well.
4,Microscope,"Had a problem with the lights on first microscope. Amazon replaced it within 3 days. Have not had any issues since. Enjoyed by both the 9 y.o. it was purchased for, as well as his older brother."
5,Great gift for a kid who loves science,Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter who likes science. She loves it and has played with it constantly since Christmas. She says it's her favorite gift. It's simple enough for her to use without any help from Mom or Dad. She took it to the Christmas family gathering and many of the adults were trying it out and they were impressed as well. We purchased some slides to go with it but it does come with a few glass slides. If you are looking for a gift for a kid who loves science you can't go wrong with this microscope.
5,winner,"I was really pleased with this mircroscope. My 8 year old daughter received it for christmas and played with it for hours. Good quality, good light settings, easy adjustments, cool pre-fab slides. For the price, its a definite winner as first microscope."
5,An excellent first microscope,"My grandson loves his new duo-scope. He already has a small standard type microscope but always wants to look at things not suited to viewing as a slide. Now he can look at all sorts of small objects, He thinks it's great. He is almost seven and is able to use the controls better than an adult. So I highly recomend it."
5,Excellent Product,"We've been using this to look at all sorts of things around the house. The kit gives you everything you need to prepare slides of your own (a small slice of one of your house plants works well, tap water and stream water are also interesting sometimes). The three settings give you enough versatility to see different objects."
2,Defective switch,"This was the only microscope I've seen with an under and overhead light, so I thought this is a great deal. After installing the batteries we found that the top light would come on but the bottom light wouldn't. It seemed to be a bad switch. Got a replacement from Amazon a few days later and that one had a defective switch as well. the bottom light comes on but the top wouldn't unless you pushed it in real hard. I considered replacing the switch myself, but it doesn't make sense to have to fix a brand new product. Overall this looks like a pretty decent microscope for young kids. Not going for a third try with this microscope."
5,grandson loved it,"7 year old grandson had no idea what a microscope could do. He was so excited to see cross sections of bug mouth, blood, nerve cells, etc. Prompted to web search hydra and rotifer to see what they were. He needed a little practice to really be able to focus the scope by himself, but he's a pro now. Had his younger sister sit and go through the slides with him. I like the light and different magnifications on the scope. A great 1st microscope for a kid who is interested. I bought box of 25 prepared slides to go with the microscope. Will buy another case of 100 prepared slides for a ""just because"" gift later.Yes, it's plastic. But he's 7 and I'm considering this a 1st scope. It is miles above the 1st ones my husband and I had all those years ago."
2,No Instructions,"The microscope is great and fairly easy to use. But it came with no instruction booklet! You really need an instruction booklet for a microscope. I checked to see if the company had the booklet on line - not this model. But I did find lots of people who never got the instruction booklets with their microscopes. Now I have to see what I can do about getting the instructions. I would not order this item unless you already know how to work with slides and microscopes. Chances are, you won't get directions!"
1,Defective out of the Box,"I purchased this product for my 5-year old son. After returning two other junk models, I was thrilled when I found this microscope, which was rated #1 for microscopes for kids. Upon taking the microscope out of the box, I could already tell that this was a better microscope than the previous two. However, after installing the batteries as instructed, I turned the microscope on and the power switch fell out. I immediately boxed it back up and am sending it back to Amazon for a refund. I guess I shall continue my search."
2,First Lab Duo-Scope is really a toy,"First realize that this microscope is in the toy section. Although description says that the recommended age is 9-18 years, it is not even appropriate for that age range. If your kid or you are into serious scientific research, this will be a waste of your time. Having only one crude eyepiece, it is really difficult to look through this for more than 10 seconds. It is a real strain on the eyes, so don't expect to be able to do any observation for an extended period of time. It's only good for a quick glance. Looking at some of their samples wasn't too difficult, once you found the right setting, but looking at cells and bacteria close up will take a lot of effort. The lens are also plastic, which means they will scratch easily, so don't expect them to last very long. Again, if you are serious about what you want to do, I would recommend something professional, more powerful, and easy on the eyes."
4,This is the MINIMUM you'd want to get for a budget microscope,This is the best BUDGET microscope that I have ever seen (and we have returned a few) --- Anything cheaper than this is junk ----This is a nice microscope -- works incredibly well --- some issues: 1) LED light is way WAY too bright --- tape a piece of tissue paper beneath the sample base to filter the light a bit (this is danger bright) 2) prepared slides are expensive ---- but it is worth the opportunity for young ones to explore.
1,Total junk,After several battery replacements this thing will simply not work. The light will come on only on occasion. It was a Christmas present for my daughter and the total disappointment she showed with this thing will stick with me for years to come.Just garbage.
1,"Want to ruin a Holiday, birthday etc.","My son is very interested in science. So get him a microscope right? The Christmas gift idea was ruined since the light projection switch stopped working on the first day. Now I have to contact the manufacturer, probably ship it back etc. You would think that the product would last more than 1 day.I enjoy shopping shopping on Amazon and have done so for quite some time. The company should dump products that don't perform. Now I have to haggle with the manufacturer through the warranty process in the morning. What a great Christmas gift."
5,Excellent first microscope!,My wife and I bought this microscope for our 6 year old son. We elected to not take a microscope from a friend's kid because it was just a toy and you couldn't see anything out of it. Our son is very interested in rocks and minerals and we were afraid that this microscope was going to be a toy as well. We were very surprised. This IS NOT a toy. This exceeds our expectations. The dual lights source option is a fantastic feature. We are constantly looking for new things to put under the lens. The quality of this microscope is great and should last for a long time.We would strongly urge you to spend the extra money to get this microscope over the other toy microscopes on the market.
4,My First Lab Duo Scope Microscope,"Got the toy in time for my kid's recognition day at school. He was amazed by the toy's capability! The magnification was okay up to the 10x option but image is a little blurred when you crank it up to the 400x. Just be careful when rotating the magnification knob, it might get loose easily. Also the light below the slide blinks a bit . Sort of loose I guess but with proper adjustment, it will work fine. Get more of those pre-prepared slides for continual enjoyment with your kids. Great scientific experience for them!"
5,Gift,"I gave this to my niece. She's used it a lot. I think it works well. I wouldn't consider it ""professional,"" but it seems to have been an inspiration for her to do some more things that she likes to do."
4,Terrific Gift for 7 year old,"Well made, durable, easy to use, and good magnification. Buy extra packs of slides to creat your own things to look at under microscope. Great gift"
4,Great microscope!,"I purchased this for my 8 year old son. It works great! Easy to use, durable, made well. I recommend it to other parents."
3,"Not bad, not that good",This was not what I expected. I was looking for something a bit more grown up. Good for a younger kid.
4,Great microscope,"This microscope is built really well and the optics are clear and bright. My son loves it. Get an additional kit of slides or prepare your own, however, because it doesn't come with very many prepared slides."
4,Great microscope.,"Nice and sturdy, lots of good prepared slides. The only negative was that the LED backlight could bea little bright."
5,Perfect first microscope !,"I bought this microscope as a Christmas gift for my nieces, ages 5 and 7. Much to my surprise they were enamored with it.I would highly suggest that you also purchase the prepared microscope slides as as adjunct gift. My nieces were able to immediately use the microscope and examine goldfish scales, etc.What a wonderful first experience with the world of science."
1,Cheaply made,"Fell apart in first use. My daughter at the time was 11, and I was sitting right there with her. She was not rough with it, followed all the instructions. It broke. The mechanism that moves the lens thingies let loose and kept breaking the slides while they were on the ""tray"". The light kept burning out, and everything was hard to see because it wouldn't focus no matter what. For $90, this is a ripoff."
4,very accurate microscope,"I was very satisfied ,and I was glad that I hunted to find the best one. You can see the samples very clearly. I would recommend it to others. Price is not astronomical, either."
5,Good value indeed!,"This did indeed meet my expectations, which were based on reviews here on Amazon. It's ability to handle both conventional slides and solid objects greatly enhances its attractiveness to kids (which isn't easy in this age of video game alternatives). For the price it's a great value.Our unit had an optical aberration, but an e-mail to the company (C&A; Scientific) received a response within 20 minutes; they shipped a new scope without further trial or tribulation.Recommended for quality, value, and customer service."
5,Great Scope Great Price,"I am very pleased with this scope. I am a lab technician and was a little nervous about the quality of the scope for the price but, was very impressed with the quality. Only cons are: the stage does not move from side to side(to be expected for price) and the light source can be very bright on low power(we just put a small piece of paper over the light to dim it some). Overall, great scope."
5,Great toy,"My 6 y/o son loves it. He prefers this over video games and watching tv. He doesn't call it a toy its a ""science experiment."" He poked himself purposefully with a lancet to look at blood. He went looking for all kinds of bugs. It keeps him entertained for hours."
4,Works as good as reviews state.,Excellent optical quality. Its kind of lightweight but I expected that considering the cost. Lighting works good and focuses well. My 10 yr old girl is really enjoying it. I give it 4 stars only because of the light weight.
4,So far so good,"I was looking for a kid friendly microscope that could actually teach my nephew about science without looking rinky-dink. Read the reviews, sent it for christmas, heard he liked it better than his eyeclops night vision glasses, which I find says alot about the product! Don't know how it's holding up, but so far so good! Impressive for an almost 8 year old boy!"
3,Excellent... if all objectives worked,"My ten year old daughter received this as a gift. To our delight, we found that it came with both prepared slides and blank slides. We began using it and we discovered we could not focus using the 40x objective. Needless to say, my daughter was very disappointed."
2,it is just a toy,It looks pretty cheap. All plastic. I do not know how come it is rated so high. I am disappointed after I saw it. It looks cheaper but cost more than the one sold in t&r. I think it is overpriced above 50 bucks.
5,Great Value & Quality for Inquisitive Young Minds,"I bought this microscope for my nine year old son. He has been excitedly collecting all sorts of items from around the house and yard to inspect. The microscope is easy to learn and use and sufficiently durable, although I wouldn't classify it as a toy; and user error could certainly damage it. But, damage wouldn't be the fault of the manufacturer, as it is well made and simple.Some of our (yes, even the adults in the family enjoy it) features:* 4x, 10x, and 40x magnification* Top and bottom lights for viewing solid and translucent substances* Easy to use clips* Comes with sufficient supplies to get started* Easy to navigate instructionsAfter we unpacked and set up the microscope, we had a doctor-friend over who gave my son a bit of a tutorial. Not only was it helpful, but it gave a real-world impression of what the microscope can do. Her excitement as a respected professional was really significant in learning to appreciate the microscope."
5,Great Microscope for Kids!,I bought this after reading the reviews. Almost all were positive and I went for it. I am SOOOO glad I did. I wanted a microscope that my children could actually see something in.........they can. I wanted a microscope that was durable........it is. My children love this!!! Their words.........AWESOME!!!! Cool huh?
3,Great Microscope-Upper light does not work,"GREAT microscope, keeps my 10 yr old daughter busy for hours and us too! We put everything under it that she can. Fish water was the best! The upper light does not work ever since she got it for Christmas, but we had opened it and used it a few days before we realized it. Returns say it has to be unopened? It'd been a good deal other than the fact that its too much trouble to find out how to get it replaced/fixed now. We got it on Amazon.com. Very disappointed.We ordered extra slides with samples on them, they were definately worth getting!! A must! We ordered blank slides which were lost in the mail a few weeks, the order was through Amazon but another company handled it, they had to ship them late after Christmas. They are good to have. We love the microscope, just wished it worked properly."
3,Easily 5 Star if not for a Quality Control Issue,"Great microscope for the money. Easy to use. Light is powerful enough to get the job done.The only problem is that the 40x objective does not work at all. It is cloudy and will not focus at any distance. I tried cleaning it to no avail. I've been using the 10x objective and it's great, but could really use the extra magnification of the 40x."
1,disappointing photos,"very disappointing photos, despite the claim of thousands of photos offering ufo's best evidence. possibly they are poorly reproduced, which would be a real shame. why bother printing the book?some day i'd like to see her photos properly presented."
2,she offers whaco anti-government theories about the ufos.,She brings up the old looney canards about the Trilateral Commission and the Bildebergs ( read Jews} who control the world.She claims there are aliens in her photos. See for yourself and strain your imagination. I truly beleive thet strange things are happening in Pine Bush but Ms. Crystall offers nary a solid piece 0f documentation in her book.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! RUSTED IN THE SECOND DISHWASHER WASH!!!,"The pans look very nice and very durable-but they are NOT!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label. When they came out of the dishwasher there were RUST SPOTS all over them. I am going to try and return mine as soon as I get a chance. I never even got to use the pans before they rusted. It should be noted that a)The pans were NEVER left soaking in water or in the sink b)There was not ANYTHING even the TINIEST bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have ""rubbed off"" rust onto them or anything like that. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE pans-they should be ashamed to make or sell these!!!"
1,Disappointment-But I still love you Barbara,"I was 5 when this show was on and my family watched it every Saturday night. I have been waiting years for a DVD release. However, it was a huge disappointment. My favorite parts were the opening song and dance numbers in the middle of the show. These are all cut from the DVD set. So if you, like me, were hoping the DVDs would be filled with these numbers, you might want to reconsider spending the money. I hope someone sees these reviews and will release the actual ""Best Of"" the Mandrell Sisters. I'm still waiting!"
2,A terrible hack job with many scenes cut,"I was really looking forward to this DVD, being a huge fan of the television show. Unfortunately, when I started watching the set, I found out that this DVD set focuses on the guest stars throughout the show's run. The popular opening numbers and song and dance routines which were a highlight of the show are all cut. It's really disappointing to see Time-Life release something like this, without so much of the good material gone."
1,What Price Publishing Rights...,"The cheap butchers at Time Life are too cheap to pay publishing rights for the use of songs, SO they chop it out. Chop chop chop. No class, no integrity, just gotta get that extra buck."
1,The Best of Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters,"What a disappointment! They should have simply called it Guest Star clips from the show. We used to watch the show every Saturday night as a family and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the opening numbers and dances sequences were all edited out. Maybe someday they'll put out a complete collection from the show so that everyone who does remember it, can enjoy it."
1,At last - superb Barbara,"Yes they are edited to 29 minutes a show and yes they concentrate on the guests - BUT it is fantastic to see the great Barbara Mandrell at last. I really never thought this would happen. This set is superb, a great reminder of a superb talent - we in the UK took the shows and they were edited by the BBC - thank you -at last I can see the greatest female US country star of all time!!! PS: I seem to have pressed the wrong button - this is 5 stars!!!!!!!"
4,Nice title,The title of this album reminds me of what I like so much about the Wildhearts. They can be silly and fun and that is the kind of music that keeps me interested in a band. Party rock!! Even when the band shows their serious side they are still more fun than ther others.
2,A couple of points ...,"First, just to clarify, this is a book for people who own a small business and want to start an e-newsletter (written & edited by themselves) about it; it's not a book for people looking for information on getting into the business of producing e-newsletters.Second, I found some of the advice ... well, here's an example:In a chapter titled ""What do I do if I can't write?"" the author says ""The most effective e-newsletters are those that sound as if the company leader is just talking, filled with all the slang, run on sentences and joking around that comes out in person.""That just doesn't sound right. It would have been nice to see an example from a highly successful e-newsletter in this style, but the author doesn't provide any examples to support this assertion(or any of the other dubious-sounding bits of advice in the book)."
1,Should have been a newsletter,"The content of this book could have been reduced to a newsletter! There was so little information provided that the author only put one thought per page, some times only a few lines per page. What a waste! Don't bother to buy this book new, buy it used for about $1.50."
3,crimanal minds....silencer,"Crimanal minds is my favorite show. This was a good episode but not one of the best. I totally miss Emily Prentiss. She added another character to the family. The video and sound on my Kindle Fire(the original) was great! Nothing wrong with the product! Thanks, Deanne"
5,One of the best shows on TV,"I have enjoyed CM since season 1 and the show is still going strong! Great cast, excellent story lines will continue to watch"
3,Not one of their better episodes,As a fan I will watch CM but this one a little below their standard. Dialogue was great. Didn't care for the plot that much.
5,great actors,It is so nice to see this program without commercials. I love this program but it always seems to break often so I like the DVDs.
5,Criminal Minds!,I chose this rating because i love love love me some criminal minds and will continue to buy every season!
5,criminal minds,The best tv show ever made. I hope they keep making it for years to come. Thomas Gibson is a great actor and leader.
5,Great Show,Great show in the tradition of great CBS police - FBI shows. Really like AJ Cook. Was afraid she was leaving the series glad she didn't Remember her from Virgin Suicides Movie
1,"Criminal Minds, Season 08","Past episodes were more about catching a killer, Season 08 is more about gore. I am very disappointed. I am glad they did not make to many of them....it would be a complete waiste of money"
2,Too Expensive,"I love the show, but the individual fee for an episode is too high. I'll wait until I can buy the DVD's."
1,Movie Halted Thrice,Title says it all. No issues with Internet - other devices working - but this stopped three times. Not much else to say.
5,Better than expected,This season is better than what I was anticipating. I was worried about how Jeanne Tripplehorn would fit in with the dynamics already established with this superb group of actors. Her character has been a nice addition. Glad that it is working out. Love this show!
3,This program gets darker and more bizarre with each passing season,"Sensational killers and borrowed plots from the likes of Thomas Harris, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child; Agent Pendergast would be a fine addition to this show."
5,Criminal Minds,"I got this eight season ,because my daughter collects them .She just loves watching the show,so I,ve been getting the season for her."
4,CAUTION - may become addictive,"The product is great. Good taste, fairly health-directed, appetite support - but you might want to order these bars when the weather is much cooler. My shipment arrived in late August. The chocolate coating had melted and provided a gooey mess and mysterious covering. Did not affect the taste or other qualities of PowerBar but did provide eye-sore images. Recommended at 5 star for the product itself but earns 4 stars for the shipping problem."
3,Chocolate melts and gets all sticky on a hot day,"I am used to cliff bars, but thought of giving these bars a shot because they are smaller in size but have the same calories.. But i shouldnt have got the chocolate flavor. Went out for a ride on a hot day and the chocolate melted and made it tough to eat while on the bike. May try other flavors next time."
3,high calorie adds weight,It gives energy but it is 270 calorie. Too much for me because I am watching my weight. Increasing weight is not good for running
2,triple threat,"Product is good, however, the product had been exposed to high heat and then resolidified. Very poor storage and should be credited."
2,Pretty bad,"I love chocolate. I love peanut butter. So I should love this... right?Wrong. Took one bite and threw the rest out. Worst bar I've eaten. I guess there are worse ones, and I'm really glad I haven't had them.If you're really hungry at the gym and have the choice between this or a sweaty towel, don't think twice -- go for the towel."
2,New formulation doesn't taste very good,"I love most PowerBars. I always take a couple in my pack when biking or hiking, and I also keep a couple in my briefcase for when I miss meals at work. Most PowerBar flavors are excellent.Years ago, PowerBar used to make a ""Triple Threat"" chocolate caramel fusion bar that was very tasty. This new formulation, though, tastes pretty bad. It has a very artificial, vitaminish flavor. Having said that, tastes are subjective, so you may like the flavor. Given my experience, though, I'd suggest that you buy one of these in a store and try it before purchasing a whole box of them from Amazon.If you're looking for chocolate flavored PowerBars, I'd recommend either their traditional chocolate bar (tasty, but also very sticky) or the PowerBar Harvest Whole Grain Energy Bar (very tasty, and neater)."
4,Satisfies when you want something with some crunch,"This bar has a good flavor and has the crunch you crave. Don't get me wrong it by no means has that delicious but unhealthy 100 Grand bar crunchy gooey goodness, but it will do the trick to stop the craving for something crunchy and tasty. I eat this bar with some yogurt or some fruit. At work I don't like to scarf big meals like some people (everyone has a co-worker or two that just feasts at work and you wonder how are they not out like a light...wait sometimes I do look over and they are snoring LOL)."
3,Threats,"Oh, hi. Listen up, this is an excellent product, and tastes very good! I would certainly suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good flavored bar that does not taste like sawdust, cardboard, plywood, or a milkbone. That said, I feel like I am being shortchanged. When I buy a product that says ""Triple Threat"" on the label, I want to be provided a veritable triumvirate of actual threats. Nowhere on the label does it discuss any threatening activity. I mean, what am I suppose to take away from this vague marketing ploy? Are the threats implied? Am I missing them somewhere? When I give someone a triple threat, they darn well know specifically what is coming at them. Go ahead and eat this delicious product, but be forewarned, you are not provided threats of any sort. I am rating this 3 stars, one for each ""supposed"" threat I expected to receive.Buyer beware."
5,Quality Bar,"This bar not only taste good, but it's great for a pre-workout meal at 5am. You can also use it as a mid day snack to satisfy your sweet tooth and give you that little bit of extra before an afternoon workout."
3,The texture is not too dense,If evaluated for what it is - an energy bar - this measures up to my expectations. I carry this in my bag for emergency energy when I'm traveling or otherwise unable to get regular food. The flavor and texture are very satisfying and it doesn't leave a metallic aftertaste as some bars do. The texture is not too dense or overly crunchy - just the right balance.
1,Just don't fit right,These bags are just not the size and shape they should be. The collar is OK and I was able to finagle the bag in place and use it and therefore won't bother to return. I've had better luck with generic bags (just wish I could remember where I got them). I won't buy these again.
5,Vacuum Cleaner Bags,I ordered the vacuum cleaner bags from Amazon because my niece could not find them anywhere else.Melba Denmark
1,"Hoover Brand Vacuum Bags, Not A Bargain","I recently ordered and promptly received three packages of ""Genuine"" Hoover Type K Vacuum bags. Upon using the bags, I noticed that my vacuum didn't have proper suction and opened it to see what the problem was. The vacuum bags had come loose at the collar where they attach to the vacuum cleaner. Upon inspection, all three packages of the bags I ordered had the same problem, the plastic collar isn't properly glued.These bags are either seconds, or very old stock because the bags ordered directly from Hoover, no longer have the plastic collar, instead, they have been replaced with cardboard.I've had to clean out the motor on my vacuum cleaner, in the long run, it would have been much better to order directly from Hoover."
3,Surprised they are still made.,I am very surprised that the paper bags are still available. My canister vacuum is 30 years old and still running good. Care must be taken with installing the bag onto the suction tube.
3,Sky of Stone!WONDERFUL!,i read this book 4 a book report afta i had read both rocket boyz and the coalwood way. Homer Hickam is a wonderful author and well keep u reading and reading!
4,A budding Hickamite,"It is really heartening to find a modern author who can write a book without a lot of violence and sexual content and come up with a work that you simply cannot put down. This is easily the best of his three novels about his Southern West Virginia roots. I spent just enough years in Southern West Virginia, worked just enough years in the coal mines, and lived just about the right time to be totally entertained by this book. I think that Hickam is something of an American hero and he has downplayed a life that the Nation can be proud of. Homer Hickam is one of the few (like former President Jimmy Carter or the late Justice Byron White) whom America could erect a statue to and say ""this is what a person of any age or nationality should be"" - both very accomplished and very moral. Also, what a great storyteller."
4,A most valuable resource,This book does one thing and does it well: It documents and thoroughly explains the Win32 API available in Perl 5.005. Anyone contemplating using Perl for administrative tasks in the Windows environment would do well to add a copy of this book to his or her Perl bookshelf.
1,Wrong Size Bags again,Yes I also ordered replacement bags at the time of purchase of the Hoover US140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum and received the A bag not the Y bag required for this machine.
1,Wrong Bags,"I ordered the 10 ""replacement"" bags at the same time that I ordered the Hoover WindTunnel (U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright) Vacuum Cleaner. Instead of the type Y bags required by the vacuum, they shipped type A, which are too large to fit the machine. I will try using them by folding the ends, but would have preferred to get the proper bags!"
5,They work just fine!,"I'm writing this review partly to counter the number of inappropriate remarks made towards the bags. The problem seems to be about a shipping goof made by Amazon rather than the bags performance. The comments all seem rather misdirected.At any rate, these are OEM replacements that are meant for my Hoover upright and they fit properly and perform as well as I believe they should. It is also a bonus that I bought these from Amazon's ""Warehouse Outlet"" store. The cardboard box the bags come in was slightly crumpled so I got a considerable discount. Nice!"
5,Good disposable bag,It performs its intended function well. There was no problem installing the bags. The quality is acceptable. I would recommend the product. The price is right.
1,Hoover Replacement Bags,"You sent me the incorrect size for the vacuum that I bought from you.You sent ""Type A""; it should be ""Type Y"""
1,Not Pleased,Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumI bought the Tempo Widepath Vacuum of which I am very pleased but the bags that were sent were the wrong ones. This vacuum takes (Type Y) bags. I didn't send them back in time now I am stuck with a box of bags I can't use. Not pleased
1,Not the right Bag,"You sent A bags! I needed Y bags to go with the Hoover Tempo. Other reviews warned me about this mess up. I ordered them both anyway. Even after I alerted you through e-mail that you had the wrong ones connected to the vacuum! Had to return them. And Amazon does not carry the 10 bag Y pack. Return was easy, just bother!"
5,Reasonable for name brand,Priced well for the amount of bags and the fact that they are genuine Hoover bags.
1,Product not as listed!!!!,"Be careful!! I ordered this product because it said there was a package of 10 specifically in the description. When it came in the mail, it was a package of 3. Seller said it was a ""listing error"". To me that is false advertising. Did not offer to remedy the mistake, just said I got the value of my purchase. Bags will work, but not what was ordered. Buy from someone else!!"
3,"I wouldn't call these the best bags out there,","but for generic, its cheaper than walmart. if you are on a budget, this is a good bargain. if you are looking to have top quality, buy the real thing."
5,Powerful story. It made my heart twist.,"As always, Jane Porter takes her readers to the most beautiful places, this time it was Montecarlo.Samantha is a beautiful woman that has lived through many difficult situations. The most dramatic of all loosing unexpectedly the people she had loved the most. For the sake of a child, she got married by convenience to Johann and he turned out to be the most terrible gambler who even dared to wager his wife and daughter!Unbeknownst to us, Christiano shares a special relationship with Gaby, but he is showing a lot of interest towards Samantha.Wait and see the change of direction in this story and please be ready to read the most heart-wrenching drama typical of Mrs. Porter.I strongly recommend it."
5,"Great love story, fast paced, steamy sex","This was my very first Jane Porter romance novel - which led to more,The Italian's Virgin Princess (Harlequin Presents, No. 2430), and more,The Greek's Royal Mistress: Princess Brides (Harlequin Presents). If you're a sister, you'll love these fantastic romance stories of three sisters and their romantic adventures. The sex scenes are deliciously steamy - I hadn't read much in this genre before, but now I'm hooked! Thanks, Jane Porter!"
4,Finished it in afternoon - very Harlequin style novel,A friend recommended this author due to her new novels;Odd Mom OutandMrs. Perfectand while I was waiting for those novels I check out her earlier work. In this book Samantha married Count Van Bergen because she loved his daughter but now is gambling all their money away. Cristiano hates Count Van Bergen and when the Count bets his wife - Cristiano agrees. Lots of twist and turns - I did skim a little Samantha had to grow up ALOT.
3,Contemporary?,I liked the story but I didn't care too much for the beginning. I thought it was a contemporary but I also believed that something that came down to white slavery was frowned upon. Yet that is what it seemed like when Cristano admitted that Samantha's husband gambled her away.How could her husband block Van Bergen legally so many times for so many years when he really didn't have any money? Cristano had tons of money which would therefore mean that no legal road would be closed to him!Towards the end it got a bit much again. The whole fear thing. Yeah I could buy that but I could buy Cristano giving in to a separation so easily. Not someone who fought for years for something that he wanted; someone who claimed that he always got what he wanted. Just didn't seem to wash that if he wanted her so much that he would through in the towel for something that he obviously appeared to want more.
1,incomplete detail discription of condition.,"Book arrived with more than the stated ""edge wear"". It was missing pages and the spine of the ""trade paperback graphic novel"" is broken and loose. This should have been listed in the details of Book condition. Used but not abused is what I thought I purchased. Sad."
3,Not What I Expected ...,"I just received this in the mail today, and was rather excited to finally have ""Without Your Love"" by Cut Glass on CD (as opposed to downloaded). While there are some obscure tracks on this 3 CD set, you should know that the vast majority of these tracks are short versions. I wish Amazon would make it a policy to post the track times when they post the playlists. From now on, I will just assume that if a time isn't specified, it will be the short version."
5,I grew up listening to these songs,"Worth the buy. I bought these for my mom one year for Christmas. She loves them as they are her songs from her HS era. I grew up listening to these songs and they take up a big part in my heart. Circus Disco is still around and im sure that the atmosphere now is wayyyyy different from what it use to be, if you know what i mean."
3,"If you are an intermediate investor or better, not for you","While well written and informative, thorough and thoughtful, this is not for anyone that has a better then novice understanding of investing in the market. It will not give you new cutting edge information, but then, it doesn't promise that. It is the tried and true method of slow and steady savings based an annual 10% return. If you are new to investing it will give you a good base to build off of. One thing that was helpful was Ed's formula; zero six, which tells you what the dollar figure you would need to retire today."
1,Not up to warn standards,"I have a Warn 9.5TI winch. I wanted to keep it looking nice so I bought this cover. I wish I hadn't bought it for the following reasons.1. The cover actually trapped moisture ""in"". I bought the cover to keep rain and moisture off of my winch, but I found that on hot and humid summer days I would take the cover off only to find that my winch was literally soaked with moisture. Even though there hadn't been rain for several days. Because of this I started to use the cover only during the winter months to keep snow and road salt off of the winch.2. The cover rubbed against the grill of my jeep due to it shifting around a bit at highway speeds...after several months it rubbed the paint clean off in certain areas. It was not difficult to fix with touch-up paint, but some people might be bothered by this."
4,"Works, not the best fit.","It could of have fit better. Although it will keep rain,dirt and dust off of the winch when its in storage."
5,Huge book of 9 books!,"This is a 1224 page book containing 9 books. Volume one, The Roots of the Tree: Book 1-In Which the seeds fall in the Enchanted Forest, Book 2-In which the Roots of the Tree are Exposed, Book 3-In which the Roots of the Tree are Torn Loose; Volume Two, The other Bronze Bot: Book 4-In which several small Images travel Together, Book 5-In which the necessary allow is added, Book 6-In which the bronze goes into the fire; Volume 3, The Lonely Twin: book 7-In which ta Worldly Brother is Aquired, Book 8-In which Prosperity Enforces Loneliness, Book 9-In which the Tree is Cut Down.It does not contain a previous owners essays and notes added. That info applied to the seller who built this page, own personal book."
1,Really Mad,"I have to say I was looking forward to these cards; however, after receiving them I found out the the seller decided to rip me off!!! I am missing 6 of the Fire stones. I have an Extra Fluorite card!!! This is ridiculous!!! IT SAID NEW OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THEM!!!!!!! Now I am stuck with an incomplete deck!!!!!TIFFANIE HARKINSAmazone has since corrected this era and replaced the deck Thank you Amazon!!!"
3,Interesting but.....,"I just received the cards and book today. I have to say I am not happy with the artwork one bit. The art on the cards is all made from the computer and it really looks that way! I prefer natural photography or hand drawn art on cards. Also, the cards are very large and glossy making shuffling difficult. The descriptions of each card mentions the properties and some history of a stone and then it has a message if that was a card you pulled for yourself. The descriptions and messages are accurate and interesting. I don't think I will be using this card deck for readings, however it is a nice deck to refer to for daily meditation."
3,Interesting Concept,"As a collector of tarot/oracle cards, I was very excited to see a deck that revolved around gemstones and minerals. A few quick points- the deck would probably best be purchased along with The Book of Stones by Robert Simmons. One won't know this ahead of time, but an insert plugging the book can be found in the pack. The cards are quite large and very very glossy. The artwork while interesting isn't necessarily visually appealing. It's not computer generated imagery ""done right"" but more ""done in a hurry.""Aesthetics aside, the deck offers positive messages to help one see through situations and energies surrounding them."
3,Crystal Ally Cards,"I am very disappointed with the cards. They are too large and too slippery. I cannot adequately shuffle them. Being a petite person, my hands are small and I can't shuffle the cards in the normal conventional way. I have to shuffle them from the side or else they flip all over the place. I also think that the cards and/or book should have a realistic picture of the stones that they represent. The book itself is written well and very informative."
1,Disappointing!,"The Crystal ally cards are very disappointing. They are dark and murky.The pictures on the cards are grainy and pixelated, the colors are muted. If you are expecting beautiful photographs or pictures of crystals you too will be disappointed.The pictures are poorly computer constructed amateurish with low resolution and very undefined.If you'd like to teach others about gemstones using these cards forget about it.The cards that explain the crystals are hardly visible.I would NOT recommend these cards to anyone interested in crystal healing."
5,A true ascension deck,"These cards are really quite something. They are probably the most spiritual deck I own. The imagery and vibration of the cards is very high, as many of the stones they represent. In fact I recommend that people find these stones, as some, such as Dioptase, Phenacite, Zinkite and Azezulite are not the most common stones out there, but well worth playing with, as their vibrations are just amazing. In fact Phenacite has pretty much replaced Moldavite and Herkimers for me, as a powerful multidimensional amplifier. But back to the cards. These cards are multidimensional and speak to those on a fast track evolutionary path and are exceptional for tapping into the higher dimensional realms. They are good guides for initiations on the path and spek to the part of us that is true and wise and whole. An essential guide for starseeds or lightworkers and wanderers."
5,Very Extensive and Total History of a Great American Division,"This is a very extensive, impressive and total history of the 82nd airborne division, what was called by Generals in WWII as the greatest division of the time (of course the 101st airborne would probably argue that). The scope of this book is amazing. In its 776 pages (yes, it is long but very interesting), it lays out all the campaigns fought in WWII including Sicily, Salerno, Italy, Normandy, Netherlands, the Bulge, and Germany. And, the book tells the story at the individual unit (down to company and platoon) and individual level. It is told in the words of the heroes who fought in the 82nd during the war. As mentioned in one review, this should become the standard for not only this division but for any division for laying out the story of the heroism and the tragedy of this war."
3,Production with modest ambitions and Modest Achievements,"In the television version of Twelve O'Clock High, Robert Lansing proved to be among the most effective TV actors of his day. While this was not a ""made for TV"" film, you might consider it such since it resembles the average of the early 70's when it was made. The cast, including Lansing, is given little to do and does that little with a modicum of skill. There are some good ocean views and Hawaiian scenery, For the rest, it is not an unpleasant hour and a half with which to while away the time when your mind is otherwise occupied or you are just too tired to sleep. There is some action, some quite mild suspense, some comedy. All in all, a decent time-filler."
3,Hawaian adventure,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM as I'm a Robert Lansing fan since my early teens, and because he had said in an interview I read on the net that he had enjoyed making this film. I liked the Hawaian landscape, the scenes on the sea and Mr. Lansing's performance, as he was an excellent actor, playing a part that is not what we were used to seeing him play, which I liked. The image definition is not the best,and the plot isn't the best either, but anyway I consider the film enjoyable."
1,Worst book on the subject I have ever read!,I have read many books on the subject and this one is by far the worst. Over religious and full of misinformation. If you believe having a Stephen King book in your attic or watching a scary movie can bring a plague of demons upon you and your house then maybe you are gullible enough to believe this book.
5,"spiritual cleansing,",Spiritual House Cleaning: Protect Your Home and Family from Spiritual Polution by Alice Smith is enlightening to those who want their life and those around them clean from the influence of evil. She has a ministry of prayer for spiritual warfare which includes cleansing.
2,"Good Intentions, but not quite there yet","The Smith's offer the reader more to consider in the practices of discernment. Surely there are items in one's home that can be a defilement. The Smith's help point us in the direction in asking the questions, ""is this worth keeping in my house?"" Their writing made me ask myself that very question. And I was convicted of what to rid myself of.On the other hand, I feel that Smith's are a bit fanatical in their writing. The book sometimes felt more like a horror story. I admit that If I wanted to scare myself in a good ghost story, I would pick up this title and read it once again. (Remember the days when you sat in a darkened room with friends or siblings and tried to tell the scariest ghost story.) Spiritual House Cleaning did just that for me.As a previous reviewer mentioned, unquote, ""they seemed to be conjuring the spirits themselves."" Sometimes, I feel the Smiths were looking for ghosts. I say ""don't mess with the supernatural!"""
2,Not a Good Source of Accurate Information,"I have a copy of this book and have read and re-read it. It has taken something that is true and stretched it out of proportion.While it is true that there are objects that bring demonic oppression and invite demonic activity, it is usually easy for a Christian to cast unwanted demons out by pleading the blood of Jesus and taking authority over them.This book makes it very difficult to get away from the demonic since it lists all types of things that it assumes are cursed like Harry Potter. I highly doubt Harry Potter is a tool of the devil; he's got plenty of much better tools to work with like ouija boards and movies along the lines of Hell Raiser.While I will agree with some of what the book says, most is not even close to being true."
5,Number Two Book in Top One Hundred!!,"Spiritual Housecleaning, by Eddie & Alice Smith, received the NUMBER TWO spot in the top 100 books in Christian Retailing. This list is based on distributor sales for the period of June 1-30,2003 for English-language books in the US and Canada. It appeared in the August 4th issue of Christian Retailing Magazine."
3,They don't make them like they used to.,"My Hoover upright lasted almost 30 years before the motor wore out, but my wife is an ardent fan of canister vacuum cleaners, so I bought her her first Hoover canister shortly after we were married 10 years ago.In all honesty I don't know why she likes them so much. The machine is made of flimsy plastic in the places where metal (or at least a firmer plastic) should have been used - like the little nipples on the attachments: they're always breaking off. They don't last very long either. I've bought her replacement Hoovers on an average of every 2 years or so. We've never had one last as long as 3 years. The bag lid on our latest (a model S3606) just split apart, and this one's only 13 months old!"
1,Worst Vacuum Ever,"This vacuum is worthless. It has no power, gets clogged easily and is harder to manuever than advertised. I was very dissapointed with this purchase and do not recommend it."
2,Completely Dead After One Year,"Worked fine for 1 year. Now it won't power up. Checked hoses, bag, cord, not sure what else to do..."
1,Terrible waste of money,After a while it just doesn't work very well. It has no oomph despite changing the filter and bags. Don't buy it!!!!
3,Bought these for our Jeep Liberty...,"We bought these for our Jeep Liberty front seats and used them for about 1 year before our lease was up. Out of the package and in person they look nice. However, getting them on was another story. These were so tight, I had to get my husband to wrestle them on- which was no small task. They finally were on, but the fabric looked very ""stressed""!! Like it was going to burst open. Well- it never did, but the look wasn't the nicest. My other complaint- the fabric on the covers (with the exception on the canvas where your seat and back are) is a cheap chintzy stretchy sort of spandex-y material that get ""picks"" in it quites easily- so the back of the seat covers ended up looking pretty rough after even a month. Oh- and that same backside fabric is also very thin and will not stop much of the muddy, snowy little boots from staining the back of your seats (if you have kids). Hmmm...ummm. the pockets are cool, though!"
5,TWILIGHT/GIRL,great show i wish they would have made more then 9 episode the series ended way to soon...maybe they can still pick up were they left off.
3,Started out well...,"Just got a bit too confusing and unbelievable. Plus the acting waned. Just my two cents, and you may see it differently."
5,DVD Action,This was a very good DVD short series. Would like to have had more on the same Genre. Well acted and written.
5,Bring Back My Own Worst Enemy,It was good seeing Christian Slater on-screen again. I looked forward to this show every week. There was a little suspense with each show as to when and under what situation that mild-mannered Henry would appear when hitman Edward would be in the middle of doing what he does. Definitely should still be on the air. Reminds me of when New York Undercover was taken off the air.Some of us DO enjoy non-silly programming and prefer shows of substance. Can we start a petition to bring it back?
2,*** Don't Bother ***,"I'll start by saying I didn't buy this, but I did watch every episode as they broadcast. Although the show was great, if you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed to find, as many NBC series go, there was no ending to it. It is one that they left completely unanswered. Read the other reviews, it is very disappointing. I remember when they announced canceling this series after a whole 5 episodes, then went ahead and aired the ones they had already filmed."
5,My Fault,"Well, I guess it's my fault this show was cancelled. Because I found it to be so daringly original and liked it so much.... Which nearly always seems to be the kiss of death for shows that have that impact on me, going back to Nowhere Man, Due South, Keene Eddie, and more recently The Black Donnellys.I spose I'd be much happier if I could get into something less challenging, like Jerry Springer or those ""reality"" shows maybe.But I just don't seem to have the right sensibilty.Too bad, cuz in some ways it's a curse, really.Hey, maybe if I offered my head up to be kicked by a horse."
1,WELL NAMED,THIS IS CHRISTIAN SLATER AT HIS ABSOLUTE WORST. IF POSSIBLE THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EVEN WORSE. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOME WHERE ELSE.
2,I couldn't get into the show,"I saw the previews for My Own Worst Enemy and I was excited because it looked like an original show. I mean one guy with two lives and he didn't know about it? The show had some high points, but overall it didn't deliver like I hoped it would and I found myself getting distracted while watching it."
5,perfect,It got her in the amount of time that I was told I would like to get more items from this person again.
4,Unusual and Entertaining,"Fascinating show...naturally it was cancelled. Worth buying the DVD. All the actors are good. The premise is a bit ""out there"" but it was entertaining and different from the normal, predictable show on TV."
5,A historic look at a tragedy 150 years years ago.,"I had the opportunity to know Joe King and know the accuracy of his work and the tenacity of his searches. My family traveled to California in 1846 and were rescueres of the Donner survivors. Joe received hundreds of personal and family letters and diary entrys from living family decendents and opened new ground in this story. Most of the previous works were penned shortly after the Donner Tragedy and were very pointed in that they tried to soften some of the controversy. Many of the survivors were still living and no one wanted to talk about the gastly events at Truckee Lake. Joe King sought out the facts from family members like myself, the Donner/Houghtons, the Breens and Reid decendents. His work was reviewed by the true historians and deemed to be one of great accuracy without the myth that surrounded this topic for a century."
5,Works well; but measure your stemware's base width,"I was concerned about the champagne flute storage units because I have the taller stemware and some storage units are just a pinch shy of their height. But this was perfectly sized for the taller flute style and I was able to store them. There is only one observation: the base of the flutes do not fit in the storage unit as is. But I found that if I rotated the stemware to be stored in a rotated fashion (one up, one down), they will fit, and fit snugly. If you have a wider base than average stemware, you may have problems fitting all six flutes into the unit. If you have standard-sized base, your best option is to rotate your stemware for storage.Otherwise, it is exactly what I wanted and met my needs."
4,A good idea,I really liked the idea of this. I had champagne flutes and no where to store them so this was wonderful for me. My only complaint is that the inside separators were cardboard. I was just expecting something a little more surdy. But it works fine.
1,Not as advertised,"WIll not take large flutes, keep it 10.5"" tall and no more than 2.75"" at the base. We can only use every other pocket for our large waterfords."
5,Works Well,"I agree with another reviewer, measure the base of the flute, I too had to alternate the glasses(1 up 1 down). That said... I am happy with this product and would purchase it again."
2,"Not as Pictured, Bait and Switch.",The package listed on amazon states in the lower left corner MADE IN U.S.A.. I was charged for this package and was sent made in China bags in it's place. These bags are sold for $3.18 on other sights. I ordered made in U.S.A. and expected made in U.S.A.. If I had wanted Walmart junk I would have ordered Walmart junk. These bags may be fine and work well. The fact is that this is not what was offered and not what I ordered.
1,Still waiting,"I ordered this product, with a group of similar products, as Christmas gifts. All the other products were recieved on time and handed out on christmas day. It is currently Feb. 07 and I still haven't recieved these, my son keeps asking me where his seat covers are."
4,"Novel film successfully exposes double standards,","Aakhir Kyon? is a beautiful film that details the stigma of a divorcée for an Indian woman, her struggles and humiliations, and the strength and courage required to fight and conquer. Made in the 1980s, it did a great job of staging the question, Until when must women continue to be used, abused, victimized, oppressed, and denied the right to their own unique personality? An inspirational film, the movie shows how Smita Patil's character, simply on the basis of her own merits and fortitude, is able to start life again from scratch, begin a career, achieve success and respect, and above all, create her own identity all through her diligence and hard work. Songs have wonderful lyrics. Smita Patil is amazing as is Tina Munim. Rajesh Khanna is also great."
2,No closed captioning for hearing impaired!,"CD version of movie Chapter Two did not include closed captioning for hearing impaired or language selection options. I'd give the movie itself 5 stars, however for the $16.49 I paid, I'd give service on this CD 2 stars because it arrived on time but did not warn buyers of no captioning which is a deal breaker for me. We're a little hard of hearing. Disappointed."
3,Only on a laptop,"The film itself was very good and humerous in parts. The only problem I have with it is that it can only be played on my laptop and not my normal dvd player, which restricts the size of screen to watch it on and as a result spoils the overall enjoyment of the dvd."
3,Chapter two,VHS tape worked fine. It is clearly a video store rental that I was sold. I was not aware of this but am still satisfied with the condition of the tape. Price was fair and delivery time was satisfactory. The movie is old fashioned and stilted by today's standards. Neil Simon' dialogue is very simplistic. The actors do a fine job with his hokey style.
2,"No Thanks, Skids","I own several of the Alternators line and its a very cool idea, indeed. I admire the engineering that has gone into making these realistic car and truck models transform into many of our G1 favorites. That said, Skids is my least favorite of all of the Alternators released thus far.In vehicle mode, all of the joints dont want to seem to line up. This especially true on the roofline, where there is a distinct joint behind the front seat area. No matter how many times I transform this guy, he never seems to quite line up. I've found the doors to be the same story, too.And while we're on the subject of transforming... Skids is the most complicated mess of twisting and turning that I have had the misfortune of dealing with. The way the arms fold up into the engine area is a bit stiff, and the whole passenger compartment seems to have a mind of its own. For styling, I'll take Rollbar or Meister any day of the week."
4,Better the Second time around,This was a much better book than her first book. I almost did not buy this book because I did not like the first one very much. But my friend told me to try it I am glad that I did. Although I wish that she would had ended a little better that she did. I would have like to known what happen.
4,Fabulous adventure in Elizabethan times,"Just finished this book in about a day. Terri knows how to write fast paced novels that you just can't put down. Her latest novel is also a time-travel romance, with the heroine, Sharon Reynolds, a textile expert, stepping through a portal into Elizabethan times. BUT, before she does step through, she finds proof that King Henry had a legitimate son, one born of Anne Boylen and King Henry. This rightful heir is the one that should be on the throne and not Queen Elizabeth. Sharon is determined to set things right and find this son to give him the proof he needs. What she doesn't count on is falling in love with one Richard Granville, not realizing he is the one. Sparks certainly fly with these two. Now, the big question is will Sharon change the course of history and present Richard with the proof he has looked for, or will she follow her heart? A most satisfying romantic what-if, the ending doesn't disappoint.Thank you for reading my review :)**Pandora"
3,Decent time ravel romance,"Pretty good book, it can drag in places and can be somewhat predictable, but overall it was worth what I paid for it"
4,An enjoyable read,"Don't count on this book to be historical, but if you want an enjoyable romp through Elizabethan England you'll like it.I won't belabor the fact that it is not accurate and lacks research as other reviews have covered those facts, but I did not read it for historical accuracy. I just wanted some time travel escapism, and it certainly fit the bill.Character development is good. While Richard is quite the rogue in the beginning, he becomes more likable as the novel progresses. And I did enjoy Sharon's spunk.I really liked the ending as it was NOT predictable."
5,Great Book!,I really enjoyed this book! I thought the ending was especially wonderful...romantic and yet a total surprise. Too often a person can figure out exactly what is going to happen in the end of a romance. Not with Terri Brisbin's books -- Don't miss this wonderful love story!
2,Not the greatest,"Cons:I was disappointed by the quality of printing and photographs in this book. Many of the photos are washed out or simply not in focus. Some of the photos are really bad. The photographers that they picked are not the leaders in their field. Where are the great names in adventure photography; like Corey Rich, Bryce Kanights, Britain, Washburn etc.?Pros:Camera type, lens, and camera settings are often shown next to each photo and there is lots of copy to read. Some of the stories are pretty good.My main problem with he book is that I had higher hopes for it. I was hoping that I would get inspired and learn a few tips from seasoned veterans."
4,Hulk fans will love it.,"This box set is awesome. The incredible hulk series was ...incredible. Only Lou Ferrigno could pull off that role. Bill Bixby is a legend.As for the quality of the box set: It was really great, not a disappointment at all. My only issue is that they felt the need to release several different box sets; this one, a 24 disc one...plus the first 3 individual seasons. Now my husband thinks he needs the 24 disc box set as well. Stop releasing so many! I know they are out for the money but jeez!Also, I thought it sucked that they released the first 3 seasons separately, then you had to buy the box set for the last 2 seasons. Total BS. Hence the 4 stars."
5,Awesome!,"I ordered this series a couple months ago. The packaging is fantastic, all in their own plastic case and in perfect working condition! I loved this show as a child and it has brought back memeories! I love this show and im so glad i ordered it! BLAST FROM THE PAST AND AWESOME TO WATCH AGAIN!"
4,Thor,"Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno together how could it be anything but good.I think this series captured the Hulk very well, although both current movies were done pretty well.The packaging is done very well, although because everything is in one package you have to dig for the season or disk you want to watch - still that only takes seconds to do; let's not get too lazy.Picture quality for a series from the 1970's and 1980's is very good. I have a Blu-ray player with a 1080 Samsung TV and it really upgrades the quality of the picture.Bill Bixby portrays David Banner very well and Lou Ferrigno sells the ego of the Hulk.I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys seeing the comic books come to the screen."
5,classic,"Bought this collection for my partner and she LOVES it, she is a huge ""Incredible Hulk"" fan. So when I saw it on Amazon I had to get it for her. It is nice the quality in the episodes are very clear and crisp. I love and I know she does and it also has all the classic episodes on it."
1,Agree with Bruce Banner.,"I agree with the second review I read. Universal also has never released 2 other outstanding Sci-Fi series in the US. Six Million dollar Man Bionic Woman.Good Times video has also pulled a fast one. After all the Little House series is available now they do the complete series.#3. The hottest series of the 90's Baywatch still has no complete series in the US.#4. The Smallville 7 season came out during its usual September time frame, even though the strike shortened the season's episodes"
5,Incredible Deal!,"Product came very fast! Very good deal! I would reccomend this series to any ""Incredible Hulk"" fan! You get your money's worth, and then some!"
2,little too much going on here,I wasnt overly impressed with this book and thought it could have been simpler in the different cities that the alchemist visited. I found myself skimming thru at some points.
4,A great reference guide,"For casual card players, this book is a comprehensive guide. I have never seen so much detailed card-game knowledge assembled in one place. Scarne not only provides basic rules of the games, but also describes variations, strategies, and little-known factoids. This is primarily a reference work and is not designed for 'straight-through' reading."
4,Draws Compliments,Most seem to like the half-a-set-of-handcuffs look. Be careful with it though - it will scratch.
1,Summitt Refrigerators,"My wife and I bought a Summit Refrigerator FF975SS. Big mistake! Anybody considering a Summit refrigerator... reconsider! They are selling units that they call FF975SS but in reality they are FF975 with a new skin. The inside pictures do not match with the refrigerators they are sending out. Their attitude is terrible. Very rude and totally uncooperative! In a service business, they have no service, or even worse... bad and rude and belligerent service. I cannot express how unhappy we are with this company. Stay clear. Word to the wise...!"
5,Great author.,"As a SF reader for sixty years, it is difficult to find new authors I enjoy. This author's narrative is among the best. Her ideas are original and clever."
3,different than i expected,"I liked the storyline, but it was also quite techinical. The pictures are quite detailed, but also very small. Includes a nice moral that you shouldn't take things that aren't yours. My son enjoys reading this one, but usually gets a little distracted before the end. It's a quite elaborate plan the pigs use to get their ball of string back. I'm not quite sure if'd I buy it, maybe borrow from the library first and if it's a hit, then invest in your own copy."
4,Lost in the Rockies,This book is a fantastic correlation of history and geography. It was recommended to me by a friend who has done extensive driving through the west to historical sites. The only weak point is that it was written nearly fifty years ago so the driving directions may no longer be accurate. There was no interstate system mentioned in the book and who knows what shape the four wheeled drive roads he refers to are in.
3,"Okay, the truth. Why this?","This item seems redundant at first, I know. But it could truly be handy when used with a second A / V adapter of some sort. How many of you have AC outlets behind a stereo cabinet or large rear-projection TV? How many of those who could say yes to that question also have another TV that you'ld also like to hook your Xbox to? If you get a 2nd audio/video cable and a 2nd AC cable mounted to the alternate TV, than moving the Xbox from the main A / V system in your home to the alternate set would be only an unsnapping and the a snapping of 2 cords. Think about it, no crawling behind the cabinet and hunting for wires, no moving cabinets, no accidently disconnecting the wrong connections. It's just 2 snaps! What a convieniance."
1,This is not needed - this is a replacement cable,I understand sarcasm but the other reviewers are not helping here. If you know nothing about the X-Box or video game systems they all come with their own power cable. This item is not needed to use your new X-Box. This cable is sold as a replacement for one that has been lost or damaged. Good luck and good gaming. Wayne.
5,"I thought all power cords were the same, but...","This puts them all to shame. Throw out the shoddy cord that comes with the XBox. The AC Cable from InterAct has it all - wire, insulation, wall plug, another wire AND an XBox-compatible socket! Keeps my XBox flawlessly powered for hours. I also love the stylish black color - it goes with any decor."
5,"Cord works perfect, good buy",It's exactly what i expected and they even sent me an extension cord for it! i wasn't expecting that. I approve wholeheartedly.
2,it's ok,"if you like cheat, low budget movies with beautiful busty babes then this movie is for you, the plot is not so great, however made this movie is stupid, if you gonna use an actor on a double scene make sure that their tatoos don't show, it has alot of fake lesbian scenes than anything, if this was a porn it would be a really good movie, but it's a borderline & not so great."
1,No possible way this could have been worse,"This was... absolutely the most regrettable purchase of my life. My husband and I have tried to watch it twice and haven't gotten through it. I got it for comic value, I said how could this possibly not be hilarious after a few beers? How quickly my question was answered! The dialogue... isn't even ironically or accidentally funny, it's JUST bad. The ""sex"" scenes, albeit softcore... the people could at least act like they liked each other. The girl with the weird flame tattoos on her nipples is disgusting. The Jerker appears repeatedly every time something remotely sexy starts to happen... ruining everything. If his face doesn't gross you out, see a doctor. Everything about this movie was such a turn off (for both of us), I started to fall asleep and I was barely tired. Also, Batbabe should keep her mask on."
2,Low suction,"I was hoping this would be a good lightweight vac for around the house, but I wish now I would have paid twice the price and bought something better. It does OK with crumbs and such but is lacking the power to clean drapes or furniture. Hoover makes a commercial version of the Portapower that has a lot more power. It comes with a 30ft cord, stainless steel wands, and has a shoulder strap that makes cleaning furniture and drapes a breeze. You can use a cloth bag or the more low dust paper bag. If you're looking for something with just a little more power than a Dustbuster, the Portapower II is the one to get. Otherwise, go for the commercial model."
3,Not one of Makita's best,"Well this is my third Makita miter saw. The first two are still in use. Removed them from box and started using them. First one being 27 years ago. This saw however,I had to spend 90 minites to get this saws miter in proper alignment including drilling out the two stop spring clip mounting holes. The bevel stop bolts were loose and had to be ajusted. At least you would think they would hide the made in China on the info label, but it's right on top of motor housing in nice sized letters. Once it was ajusted properly it worked find. The light isn't that great."
3,Didn't taste that good,I just couldn't get in to this book. The attempts at humor were ok but there never seem to be a real story that developed. Not one I would keep in my collection.
3,"stronger middle, weak beginning and end","The reader is expected to take a leap of faith (no pun intended) to believe Faith's jump into a relationship with Macy at the beginning of the book makes any sort of sense. It makes no sense and it comes out of nowhere. And throughout the book the characterization of Faith is extremely weak. We never get an idea of what drives her and makes her stick with Macy who is old enough to be her mother and then some and who has horrible self-destructive habits. This completely weakens the story. The ending came out of left field with Faith randomly getting left a ""gift"" from a man who makes a 10 second appearance earlier in the book for no apparent reason. What?! The poorly developed beginning and end just drag this book down. It could have been a better book if it focused more on the main character dealing with aging and her girlfriend being a little less accepting of everything, unquestioning, and 'motherly' from the beginning."
5,I laughed out loud,"I want to be Macy or do I want to be Faith? Either way it would be great to be so witty. I loved the book, read it cover to cover in one sitting. Getting lost in a good book is better than Zoloft. This did the trick."
4,Don't be put off by the title,I was sad to see this book was labeled a lesbian romance because in reality it reaches much deeper. There are pieces that are actually heartbreaking. Beneath the profanity and harsh wit beats the heart of something much deeper---I hope this isn't her last book.
5,buy this book!,"it is seldom that i feel strongly enough about a book to write an online review. even rarer is the urge to send ""fan mail"" to the author. this book has me doing both.the plot is improbable, the characters broadly drawn, and the chronology hazy. yet somehow, it works. macy, the main character, is a driven, cigarette-smoking, bed-hopping manhattan lesbian. faith is the beguiling, honest, fresh-faced twenty-something who steals her heart. their courtship (if one may call it that) speeds between hilarity and pathos. i don't want to give away any of the wonderful specifics ... but these characters are so real, so full of life, that i feel i know them. even better, i want to spend more time with them. (sequel, please?) buy the book -- hang out with them for a long afternoon, and see if you don't agree.my only quibble is with the proofreader. while i didn't feel compelled to read with my red pencil in hand, the typos were annoying and detracted from a wonderful read."
4,Wonderfully Different,This book was wonderfully different than most books I've read based on this subject. Leslie Rule just has the ability to make the reader fell the places she mentions as if they've been there before. I can honestly say I got spooked when reading this book on more than one occasion.
4,ghosts,i myself couldnt put this down.it kept my attention all the way thru the book.i recommend this book i did write write twenty words for review
4,Paranormal book,A very accurate and a very good book if one wishes to study the paranormal spirit world it explains the basics of what one may expect.
2,Ghosts Among Us,"I thought this book was extremely weak. It was full of short bursts of descriptions and never really grasped any depth, so that my interest was not caught. I would not recommend it to those of you who are looking for a fright!"
1,Huge Disappointment,"Admittedly I didn't even bother to finish the book. About half way thru, which was almost painful, I gave up the ghost, so to speak, and put it down. I have never done that before. I was impressed w/ the author's pedigree & assumed a similar style to that of which she should be accustomed (that of her mother's) ... namely specific facts and date based upon personal experience and/or research. So much of it was hearsay. No basis of honesty. Believe it or not, I really wanted to like this book."
5,I LOVE IT!,"Leslie,Got your book in the mail a couple of days ago...I love it.I usually work more in the crime related subject matters...but for my reading pleasuure...I LOVE a good ghost story.MORE crime related ghost stories in your next book please...I'll be waiting to read more!Keep it up!!Todd MatthewsMedia Director forwww.DoeNetwork.us &www.OutpostForHope.Org"
2,So disappointing for me....,"I was very disappointed in the writing of this book. I thought Leslie Rule would be compared to her mother as an author, Ann Rule, when writing came into play. However, I find that they both write in different manners and that Leslie Rule's writings are somewhat boring, wandering and not very interesting at all. I was also disappointed in the fact that Ms. Rule doesnt seem to have a paranormal/parapyschology background like some other writers do. This is a book that I laid down and did not finish. I never do that!! However, this book was so slow moving and uninteresting, I decided to put it away."
5,True-life haunting experiences and paranormal encounters,"Enthusiasts of the supernatural will find a winning presentation in Ghosts Among Us: True Stories Of Spirit Encounters, a survey of true-life haunting experiences and paranormal encounters blended with black and white photos of haunted sites. Ghosts Among Us is no mere re-iteration of legend but presents personal first-hand reports and stories chart events from across the U.S. Author Leslie Rule is also the daughter of true-crime author Ann Rule, which helped foster her interest in mysteries of the supernatural."
1,Read this at 3 a.m. in a graveyard under a full moon and you still won't be scared,"Really boring, amateurishly reported, slapped-together ghost anecdotes or portions thereof, without climax or resolution, just a lot of lazy, unsubstantiated speculation in the form of ""Could it be...?"" or ""Was it perhaps...?????"""
4,Do you want to learn advanced english?,"This dictionary makes my english progress faster everyday. this one is advanced and supplemented version of Longman Dictionary of American English. I have found some words are missing at the Longman Dictionary of American English. But not this one. All definitions are written using only 2,000 easy words, and the meaning is easy to understand. Its layout is clear and comfortable to look for words and meanings. There are a lot of pictures and photos helping to visualize definitions. It is helpful for studying english because there are signs for the most popular words in spoken and written american english . If you want to learn higher level english, this dictionary is the one. However, this one is not perfect. The filp side is to be heavy that sometimes you don't want to carry with you."
4,Replacement filter,"This replacement filter is brand new, fits well and it is well consructed. My order was promptly acknowledged and processed quickly."
3,"Nice price, poor seam","The seam around the edge wasn't even and left gaps. The gaps allowed for air and dust to slip out, something an air filter is to prevent."
5,Much better!!,I bought a 99 Burban that was missing this release handle. This handle makes life much easier when it comes time to check the oil or anything else that requires you to open the hood.
1,Whatever.,"Just another one of the bubblegum goth bands. If you like Bella Morte, Diva Destruction, or The Cruxshadows than you'll like these bozo's to. I just can't get into this poppy stoop. It's not evil enough for me I guess."
4,Excellent Stealth Motivator,"The sub-title ""How to teach yourself anything"" drew me in. The desire to simply play a guitar was quickly replaced with a vibrant understanding of 10 basic principles of learning. We, you and I, know of them, but often fail to utilize such simple guidlines. Art presents his lesson from a very relateable stance. I discovered I was freshly cognizant of, and in turn open to the many standard operating procedures successful people and businesses practice."
2,"very cute, but not durable","The costume was cute however for the price, it was not put together very well, the velcro did not hold the other white gloves on and my mother in law had to sew them on. The first time we tried it on the one piece of velcro came off so we had to sew that on as well. We got many compliments on the costume I just wish it would have been made a little better."
4,Spider costume review,"The costume was adorable, but slightly small for what was stated. I ordered a size 2T. My toddler is on the small side so I was prepared for it to be a little big, but this costume was so snug it was not comfortable for him when I tried to latch the back velcro together. Overall, very cute...just be careful with the sizing."
4,Lana's best (unfortunately... read below),"This is without shadow of a doubt (at least in my mind) Lana's best work - why? simply 'cause for all Lana's wonderful vocal skills coming up with 10-12 attention-grabbing songs for an album was never something she and Erik could really do. Most I can count as good ones was 3-4 per album - ""Love Is An Illusion"" comes to mind here as an example of an album where most of the hits are her own not covers as on some of the other records. Anyways...hmm..what was I talking about? Oh yeah! back to this record - here she doesn't have to worry about writing ten good songs since other guys have taken care of that. Her versions of Stargazer, Kashmir, Still Loving You, Weep In Silence are great showcases for her stunning voice; almost all the songs here are highly listenable and enjoyable. Cannot give it a five since it's a covers compilation... also couple of numbers are close to mediocre but that's just my own picky self always trying to find some imperfection."
4,Brisk Novel With a Plot About Ordinary People,"I liked that this novel was about ordinary office workers and ordinary people for the most part. It also had a few moments of sarcastic humor. The novel was briskly written. If it weren't for the ""plot,"" as to Wanda and her mysterious relationship to Hector Bartlet, I wouldn't have finished this novel since I wasn't convinced by the 50th page that there was anything important to read in this novel.If I asked myself why should I care, my only answer could be to learn why Wanda got upset and why she died by suicide."
4,"A quick read, a sharp wit","I agree with jt from New Jersey. I picked up ""Far Cry"" based on its review in the NY Time Book Review in 1986 (front page coverage). If you simply accept Mrs. Hawkins at face value you will fall in love with the setting, the time and Mrs. Hawkins approach to life.Perhaps the book has a special place in my heart because I read it in a hotel bar overlooking the Arno in Florence while my pregnant wife was resting upstairs. I still reread the book and remember the bar. Funny."
2,not my cup of tea,"This book didn't live up to the high recommendation that caused me to buy it. Set in the 1950's, the social mores in the book come from the 1980's, when the book was written. Passive voice dominates the book and very few scenes carry the reader into the story--we're told what happened after the fact. The author's chatty style defines the main character well, but half way through the book I wondered if there was a plot connected to the book, and why I bothered to read it. The plot finally shows up on page 141 (out of 189). I'm glad that others have enjoyed the book, but I can't recommend it."
2,what a bore..,"Try Barbara Pym instead...or Penelope Lively. THis was so boring I didn't even finish it, and its not that long!! Maybe if I wasn't such a fan of Barbara Pym I might have had more patience, but this was really not worth even putting up with for 180 pages. Try ""Excellent Women"" instead."
3,Nice but finish is a problem,"I have two of these in my new room addition, and they look exactly as depicted. Easy to install, and they work well. The finish began to flake off on one of them, and a matte brass finish is underneath that does not match the rest of the lamp well. Thankfully, it was only a small portion that is flaking and I seem to have stopped it from spreading."
3,"Quality cut, some problems","I agree with all the other reviews on the grip, the trim, no pulling/pinching, etc., etc. so I'll just get to what I didn't like about it:1) The piece that moves up and down to adjust the trim height does not ""hold"" in place very well when pressed, so you may get varying lengths if you press too hard.2) The piece that moves up has the slots for the hair to come through, but the bars to make the slots aren't connected from top to bottom, and so when I threw it in the travel bag, it snagged on the mesh and the plastic snapped off... weh woh.Just be delicate with it I guess."
4,Stubbly Beard Critique,"This is my 2nd Remington Cordless Mustache & Beard Trimmer. The battery finally died after years of service with the first one.I only wish there were more settings for that close stubbly look. Rather than the limited number of 9 settings, it should have a continuous dial that could be locked at whatever setting you want."
3,bulky,Great for beards. Good number of settings.Bulky and not too comfortable for mustache use.Conair makes one that is less expensive and easier to handle.(trouble with the conair is that it died after 2 years)
5,a beard's best friend,"This trimmer has it all. Corded and cordless, great adjustability, comfortable to handle, econimical and never needs oiling (which no one does). Yes, this one is a winner and a bargain to boot! Considering the small price tag, purchasing a $10 decorative box (for those without drawers in bathroom) in something you may wish to consider."
1,Thumbs down,"I don't understand why this shaver has received so many positive reviews. This is a CHEAP shaver - plastic guard breaks with use (parts are unavailable); battery runs down which decreases performance even when plugged in; battery can't be replaced, making this not a green product in any way. This is a planned obsolescence shaver - expect a year or two if you use it regularly for beards, and I would never use this thing on my head."
5,"Pretty dark, but cool new take.","Icons. Powerhouses. Heroes... Spies? What a cool concept making many of DC's heroes into spies for the government during WWII and the Cold War. Batman, Hourman, Dr. Midnight, and Mr. Terrific, are a bunch of Nazi busters. Several other classic characters pop up, especially when Superman joins the team. If you like the characters of the JSA- those original Golden Agers, then you are in for a trip- and a much more realistic look at the way they WOULD have acted in that time and place.LOTS of twists and turns, but an unexpected level of violence, and killing, especially coming from many of these Heroes. I'd have more of a problem with this... but they ARE soldiers here. So, it's all cool. Definately check it out, if you have the opportunity. One of the best Elseworld tales I've read, that doesn't flat-out ape the comic formula of the characters it is representing. Worth the money."
2,Not entirely original,"I might have liked this book a little better if it wasn't almost a complete rip-off of Elseworlds: The Golden Age series. Golden age heroes fighting WWII, a Nazi ""Superman""... The Golden Age has done this all before, but much better.The art might have saved it, if only I could tell who was who. There faces all seamed the same, and when they are in plain clothes there is not much else to determine one from the next.Plus, The Golden Age was much more emotionally involving than Liberty Files. You give more of a damn about them when you see their growth and torment.The two stars may be a bit harsh, but I'm always disappointed when I see characters with so much potential being redrawn into a bland version of a previously good comic. Check out The Golden Age."
3,3.5 Stars a little better than ok,"This was an interesting read, although not exactly what I expected. It was believeable and a bit humorous too. The characters are a bit strange ...all of them, and its worth it to see what happens. I agree with one of the other reviewers that once you start reading, you won't want to put it down."
2,Kennedy Toole this isn't.,"I picked up this book because of Kennedy Toole's name and New Orleans were on the book cover. When I read that the main character, Gus, gets his chaplin job through a lie and a lark I thought I was in for some fun. About halfway through I realized I'd been had. The characters were one dimentional and the author was pushing them around where he wanted them to go, rather than be lead through the story. I thought there was great potential for some humor with Cuban brothers who wanted to open a Wal-Mart version of a botanica. But the humor never came. I kept waiting and thought the Jazz fest scene would finally deliver a gag but no luck there either. If you are expecting Ignatious Riley type illusions and charm then you won't be happy with this choice. If the book had been billed as a tragic drama I'd have been more impressed."
5,Another Free Floating Ambient Trip From The Master Himself,"These three ambient soundscapes are pretty much what you would expect from Steve Roach. That is a complement. He really has a handle on what makes ambient music great. Nothing jarring or bothersome is present here, just smooth flowing sounds that relax you or put you in a meditative zone. The second disc contains some mildly ominous material, but it is not overly scary, just a bit dark. There are no beats or melodies in Immersion: Three, so if you are looking for that, don't get this. On the other hand, if you love ambient music done right, definitely check out some Steve Roach music, and Immersion: Three is a great place to start. His other work, Mystic Chords and Sacred Spaces is similar, so if you like this, you may want to get that too. I have over a dozen Steve Roach albums and collaborations and there is not one I don't like. Happy journeying!"
4,"An academic history, not a tourist guide","T.A. Larson -- known in fine Western fashion by his initials -- has written the official, scholarly history of Wyoming filling a huge gap in published literature about the state. Primary source material about Wyoming abounds, but few of us have the time or training to find it and then plow through it to make sense of it. Anecdotal information and imagined histories are also widely available, but few of those are reliable if you want accuracy or even the slightest bit of objectivity. Places built on myth -- and Wyoming was born of a number of them -- are wonderful, but they shouldn't be exempt from a more scholarly treatment like this. There are plenty of guidebooks, such as ""The Wyoming Handbook"" in the series published by Moon, that give you historical ""color"". But for a fuller, more realistic picture of this fascinating place, Larson is definitive."
5,A Great Halloween Guide to Haunting,"This book is ideal for home haunters or those producing a haunted fund raiser to collect ideas for developing the haunt. Written for the armature there are dozens of creative ideas to perform scares, decorate a room, party or front yard and ways to create special effects. The hundreds of humorous illustrations walk you through each idea. This book is an inexpensive way for any Halloween enthusiast to get started. It's worth the price of the book just to read for laughs."
2,A disappointment overall.,"This book outlines some yard ideas, but they apppear uncreative and need special equipment. If you're looking for halloween party ideas tho this may give you some ideas. Some pranks for trick-or-treaters are one time pranks. If you're looking for simple, practical ideas on creating dummies, haunts, and spooks this is probably not the one you want."
2,Not for the busy mom,"This Halloween guide had plenty of neat projects for making your house scary for Halloween. I found that the instructions were pretty thorough, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.I'm a busy working mom. There's no way that I would be able to invest the time or the money in many of these projects. If you are a person who's really into Halloween, this book is for you. However, if you're like me, a very busy person who needs to put together a party for her kids but only has limited time, I'd recommend something like ""101 Spooktacular Party Ideas"" by Linda Sadler."
1,Tokyo Mew Mew,"I'm sorry to say, I did not enjoy this manga at all. I thought it was too cute. I would definitely say that this is a rip-off of Sailor Moon. However, I do agree that 4Kids Entertainment did a HORRIBLE job with the anime.I probably would've enjoyed this better if they had toned down the cuteness a little more.2/10"
4,Great Manga! just a little too much cuteness...,I really enjoyed Tokyo Mewmew volume 1! The story is about five young girls who become cool superheroes infused with endangered species! I really liked this book and i would have given it 5 stars if only it wasn't so cute! I mean it is not realistic at all with all that cuteness! And i do not recommend it to girls 10 and under (or boys) because when ichigo transforms she is completely naked!I do not think that is good for young girls to see! Anyways other than nudity and cuteness this is a good book to read!
4,Great,"It's nice. It gets better during the middle, when Ryou is introduced. However, near the start, it's quite like... what? That kinda thing. Warning: If you have read the manga, then DO NOT ever, under ANY circumstances, watch the anime in English! They name Ichigo-Zoey, Ryou-Elliot, Zakura-Renee... etc etc. It sucks beyond belief. (english anime) Poor Mia..."
5,A great shoujo manga for all ages!,"I have always wanted to watch the anime ""Tokyo Mew Mew"" I was more than happy when I bought the first volume of the manga. It may not be the anime, but it's just as good. The artwork is beautiful, and the English translation is very good. The story is about an 11-year-old girl named Ichigo, who is on a date with her crush at the exhibition,and then something like an earthquake happens. Ichigio soon finds weird things happening to her like-when she falls she lands on her feet, cat ears and a tail popping up out of no where, and she suddenly starts having an appetite for fish.She finds out that she was chosen to be part of the ""Mew Project"", along with four other girls-Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, and Zakuro. (Pudding and Zakuro will be introduced in volume 2)I find this manga to be quite sweet, and cute. If you like cute and sweet shoujos, then you should definitely give ""Tokyo Mew Mew"" a look!"
4,TOKYO MEW MEW IS THE BEST ANIME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this anime I have read all the books and watched all the anime . I think everyone should give this anime a try because its really good I loved the anime that I was mew ichigo for halloween. I even got some of the toys and some figures because this anime was my fav out of all them. I am a big tokyo mew mew fan I hope you people give it a try. mew mew stlye mew mew grace mew mew power in your face nya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Pretty good, but some highly annoying things bout the series","Yes, this is a pretty good series. And yes, it was my first manga series so i have a special bond with it. But..... It annoys u after a while. Lemme explain the stroy.11 year old Momomiya Ichigo is on a date supposdly kawaii guy. (By the way on the back of the manga it says ""Hot date"". Hot date meaning to the museum.) At the museum, Ichigo meets five girls there, and they suddenly see a hufe flash of light.(They say earthquake, but i think it was a flash of light) It turns out, that light made them be fused with endangered animals.Now, I'll explain what gets annoying. Everyone becomes suddenly in love with Ichigo, the main character, which really bugs me cuz let's see.... she's stupid, annoying, not really all that pretty, and did i mention she's a major ditz? And soon, everything revolves around her, not around the other character. Personally, I think the author has to work on letting other characters having a part too."
5,The Cats Out of the Bag,"I am 13. This is the best manga I've ever read. I am very nervous about mangas because they will eventually have an evil sign or something. But Tokyo Mew Mew never showed a sign of evil. Not only that is was HILARIUOS! My mom was about to take it away cause I wouldn't put it down and do my homework. Anyway, this is the best manga for all ages. I hope you enjoy it!"
5,Catgirl? Magic girl? Cute and enjoyable!,"Cute, fun, and amazing!It follows the generic magic girl structure but it's unique and charming in the way they inplument an 'animal' theme. The main character being a catgirl really caters to a lot of manga fans, but even though they may sound perverted coming from a guy, it's not exactly what I'm trying to imply. Well, there is something huggable about a catgirl.But it's a unique, and adorable entry to the otherwise sometimes repetitive magical girl genre."
2,Can't hold a charge,"Performance was OK overall, but after one year of light use, it does not hold a charge for long. It currently only holds enough energy after a full charge to work for 5 seconds at full power. There is no possibility of replacing the battery, despite the rest of the system working fine. My next one will certainly not be a Hoover."
2,Dattery Dies,This vac worked fine for about a year and then the battery went dead. Now it will only work for a max of 5 seconds. Not a good investment.
5,Best hand Vac around,"We lost our first hand vac just like this when we moved and decided to get this one (same model as lost one) because of how well it works. I screwed the mount into the wall and it plugs in and charges nicely. It has a lot of suction to pick up cheerios and crums. The only draw back I think is that the opening is a little small and some things get stuck. For example, a cheerio fits, but a piece of skittle candy is too fat."
3,Emergency use only,The bags were received quickly and I have them stored for use if I run out of the Hepa Bags.
1,Bait & Switch,I was very annoyed to find I'd wasted my time and money ordering this product. The image on line showed what I wanted and on the box as well but INSIDE the box the vacuum bag was made wider instead of longer so it didn't fix my vacuum cleaner.
2,caveat emptor,"You initially asked me to review my purchase of that Hoover cleaner I bought but now you say on this page I am to review only the Package of Bags! ... You of course realize you are making this ""easy"" review difficult....I wonder why. But YOU asked for this.Hold your breath. I give the cleaner a zero or at least aone-half rating on a 1 to 10 (ten being the highest). I have used the cleaner twice, to give it a fair chance.THE killer point about the cleaner is its so-called highly maneuverable hose....yeah.It is about as supple and lithe as a steel pipe and is an absolute drag on the device. It gives one a real workout.If only I had not bought it. Oh well, c'est la vie.I am going to buy an upright vacuum, not a Hoover and not from Amazon.Thanks a lot."
5,What goes in them stays in them ... even that dusty smell,"I have been using the same bag for a month now and still haven't filled it up. I have been vacuuming everything too, so I would say the size of the bag is good. There hasn't been a dusty smell either even when the vacuum is first turned on.I highly recommend these bags, what goes in them stays in them. :)"
1,Beware - 'GoVaccum' does not ship Hoover brand,Beware - 'GoVaccum' does not ship Hoover brandThe compatible should not be listed here.
5,vacuum bags!,"These bags are the finast vacuum bags ever....EVER! So, if you need to vacuum fruitcake out of carpets, floors, or dog houses [where I stash mine!]....these bags are for you! They truly offer superior sucking action [can I say that here?]. Seriously, I've noticed that running my vacuum with these bags takes the cig-smoke out of the air! Pretty impressive!!!cheers!SR...pro-reviewer"
3,Vacuum Bags are not as advertised by Amazon,"I am disappointed with the product because it is not as Amazon portrayed it. When viewed online the vacuum bags are described as ""by Hoover."" They are called ""Micro-Lined"" and are not made by the Hoover Company. They are made by the Dust Vacuum Corp. My main disappointment is with Amazon for not correctly identifying their what they are selling."
4,Past Presence,If you like light reading with a hint of mystery this is the book. I feel as her 1st novel this is a keeper and good reading for any bookclub
3,"Too much teasing, not enough pay off ...","This book has been on my to read pile for quite some time; but, I was hesitant to purchase a book by a new author, only to be disappointed in the writing - which has been my experience with new authors lately.While I feel her writing is good and her ability to describe a scene is very on point, I was disappointed with the ending. It's like being on a roller coaster and the ride up that long, steep, deep hill is driving you mad and making the butterflies in your stomach jump like crazy. Just as you reach the top and you're anticipating that ride down the hill .... It turns out to be a small dip instead ....Rest assured though, I will take a risk and read her next one ...."
4,Gorgeous and full of information,"Well written and encyclopedic in its range, this book is also full of amazing photographs."
2,Simply Christmas Music,"I was searching for more of an acoustic type music, and this was too much piano. This is good if you like piano music."
5,New age has a new face!,"I just found Shirley Cason's site and listen to her music there and just fell in love with her Simply Christmas CD! I just wished the CD would never end. It's that good. Even though I never heard her music before, I really think this CD will fit nicely in my Christmas music selections for the holidays."
4,Simply Christmas is Simply Great!,"First, let me say that this CD was NOT what I expected from someone so adept at new age; but that turned out to be a surprisingly wonderful development. In ""Simply Christmas"" Shirley hits the mark dead center on December 25th. This is a delightful rendition of traditional Christmas music; past and present. The best example I can give is to equate this to a well done interpretation of the Star-Spangled Banner,(ala Whitney Houston) as opposed to attempts by many who destroy the original's traditional beauty. Shirley has created a unique balance of keeping alive the love of your favorite Christmas memories while creating a glimps of future holidays full of hope. It's old. It's new. It's ""Simply Christmas""... and several copies are simply going on my Christmas list! (Only 4 Stars???, Yes Shirley your 5th star is sitting proudly atop my tree!!!)"
4,Academic but excellent,"This text takes a look at differences between communication styles of men and women. It is an academic text, full of statistics, studies, and so on. Nonetheless, it is an amazing source of information about the differences between communication styles based on gender."
3,Couldn't bear the taste,"Unfortunate, I could not take this liquid after my first bottle. The taste was never acquired, and it spoiled my protein shakes when mixed. I'm sure it works fine, but the taste is enough to keep me from finding out its true results. I am looking for an alternative pill form."
3,One of the most complete and accurate books I've come across,Dr. Craft has really done his home work. This is the only book I have found that gives complete and accurate information on ALL the models of cars promised. Complete and accurate information along with good color photography make this not just a coffee table book but an enthusiasts reference guide as well..
4,Boss and Cobra Jet Mustangs,I recommend this book. It has detailed information and good photos. Informative regarding the racing history of the Bosses.A good addition to any automotive library or just for a solid understanding of the boss and cobra jets!
3,Don't get excited,"Although adorned with the Marshall logo, this little amp does not live up to the name it carries. While the clean channel sounds good at mid to low levels, the distortion, is just that; distorted, as your guitar will lose its identity when played a high levels. Although I only purchased this amp for $30, it does outplay most mini amps that I have used, but does not live up to the Marshall trademark. My advice is to save your $50 and by a good solid state combo amp such as crate or Randall (long live Dime)."
2,Okay little amp,"This was my original review:I love the sound of this amp. Even regardless of size, it sounds great. I think $50 is a little steep considering some used amps you can get for that, but if you need something small...VERY small to just have around this is probably the best thing you'll find. It actually sounds better than a couple practice amps I've used in the past.After messing around with this little amp for a while, I've found the overdrive is almost non-existent. You need to turn it up almost all the way to get any that resembles an overdrive sound. I got a replacement since the first one I had didn't sound right and the second one sounded a little better but not nearly enough to justify the purchase. I've just returned that one and will be buying a Fender mini amp instead. Unless you are only interested in clear, clean tones, don't get this amp."
1,crap,sounds like crap. plays like crap. cant get any tone differentiation from the knobs. its a toy. save your money
5,marshall ms4,"the marshall ms4 is a great addition to the big amps that i have, the sound qualilty that comes out of this little guy is amazing.i play my martin through this, amoung others, and the deep rich tone comes right through.little enough to take to the park or a friends house.battery operated.this is just an amazing product.i would recomend this to everyone.its one of the best buys i've done in a long time.well worth the money.and its cheap.great product"
5,Tus Zonas Erroneas,Tus Zonas ErroneasEste libro es muy interesante; me ha echo pensar en muchas diferenttes formas de ver el mundo y a mi externo e interno yo. Se lo recomiendo a todos los que deseen ver mas alla de lo que nuestros ojos puedan ver.
5,very cool !,"even if your not of Irish descent, you will find this book, enjoyable and informative reading....."
3,A neat little book that doesn't provide pronunciation,"I am trying to learn Gaelic on tape, so I thought this would be a funny addition to my library. They have some extremely interesting phrases in there, including ones that made me laugh out loud. It is a clever little book and I got great fun out of reading it.Unfortunately, there are no pronunciations provided. I can piece through some of them, but it would be better if they were all shown so I could use them. I'm not sure it is intended for beginners, people who can speak Irish, or just for fun, but this is a significant problem with the book -- I can't use it to make my Irish more interesting!All in all, it's a funny book to read but it doesn't ultimately help you learn Irish (wicked or otherwise). Irish pronunciations are not easy (at least for me) and the more practice you can get, the better."
1,Not worth the money!,This was a tiny little book. I ordered it for Christmas and was shocked when I got it. It's so small!!!! It's not just a short book but the book itself is also miniature. It reminded me of something that would come free with another purchase. I'm so mad that I actually paid for it!!! I also don't understand the reviews about it being so entertaining. Don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,ETHNIC STEREOTYPING JUST DOES NOT WORK FOR ME. ETHNIC JOKES ARE A THING OF THE DISTANT PAST.,"Books like this don't have to cross the line of decency to be fun; but this one does. Ethnic jokes just don't cut it today. Most people have come to undersand this, and unforetunately, some insensitive morons haven't gotten it yet. Ethnic jokes of ANY kind, say a lot about your household - keep them there if you must spew them. Losers comedians use ethnic stereotyping to disguise their deep rooted bigotry. Jokes arefine, but not bigotry/racist/ethnic-bashing ones. Don't bother buying a book insulting to the Irish or anyone. Slawn lot (phonetic Gaelic for good-bye)"
4,"Funny, not realistic, Irish phrase book","When you think you might want to learn a new language, first read How To Learn Any Language. You'll find a path to follow for learning languages. One tool is the phrasebook. This phrasebook, however, isn't really what you're looking for. It is funny, outrageous, and it has a pronunciation guide. There are a lot of golfing references (strange enough), and really interesting bits of background history of the country. I just can't imagine ever saying ""That goes down like the nun's knickers!"" in a pub, no matter how strong the whiskey.It is funny to see it laid out in Irish's horrific grammar.Get this book to lighten you up a bit as you slosh through Learning Irish (the best Irish course out there)."
1,Waste of money.,"The Gaelic is wrong on most accounts and I've had brochures with more content than this ""book"" which should be listed as a pamphlet instead. If I would have seen it in a store I would have never bought it. Besides, everyone speaks English in Ireland so there's no need for a badly translated Gaelic phrase book. If you use these phrases in Ireland the locals will think you're an idiot. I'm disappointed, I really wanted to like this book and find worth in it but sadly, there's barely enough paper for me to start a fire with."
4,why wicked,"a fun little book that adds to the Irish learners referances, just!while it is appreciated that the angle was humour, so much more could have been included, and so much should have been left out- notably the obsession with tthe side of the road.Many classic Irish phrases have barely been touched... maybe book 2 can rectify this."
2,S-Video/AV Cable by InterAct Accessories,Overall this cable is decent for its intended purpose (S-VIDEO).It is not on par in build quality as the OEM standard XBOX cable that came with the game. The cable that plugs into the back of the XBOX fits in too loose. It can accidentally be pulled out a little too easily than the original cables.The cables actually had my XBOX graphics acting jittery on the television. I quickly switched to the original cables and everything was fine. (Maybe I had the S-Video and the RCA Video Cable plugged in at the same time)For starters this is an economical way to go.For 10.00 more I would stick with Microsoft's Advanced AV Pack allowing for future purchases using Dolby Digital components.I rated this 2 stars because I am very demanding when it comes to fit finish and quality. The rear plug stability into the XBOX just turned me off:(
4,This cable is fine!!,"I don't know what the problem is with the person that says this cable doesn't fit properly. Must have gotten ahold of a bad one or something. Fits like a glove in my box. This is a cheap solution, and trust me, there isn't a noticeable difference in picture quality between this cable and the Monster cable. If you can tell the difference, why are you using S-Video? Go composite and by all means, use the Monster Composite cables."
2,a lot of talk!,"Basically the book contains only one chapter worth reading. The rest of the book contains unuseful definitions, such as definitions of creativity. Basically, I think most of the questions addressed in the book about creativity, etc. are irrelevant to whether the computers can tell a story or not. Finally, chapter 6 describes the system. It has to be said, the chapter was very clear and the discussion of the implementation of the system was well laid out."
4,Only one major problem,"Very nice, easy to use machine. It does have one major problem - there is no provision to store the cord - there is no hook to wrap the cord on so you end up with 20' of cord with no place to put it."
3,Maybe Its Just Not My Style,"This album gets at least 3 stars off the bat because like every CMR artist or group they bring Christ front and center. However I really thought the flow was sloppy and the beats were offsetting, they didnt really go together. I thought half the songs were under par and the other half was ok. The only song that I really liked was the last one with Flame, Ambassador, Lecrae, Phanatik, and R-Swift. That song was more along the line of my style and taste. Again leading me to believe that Everyday Process is just not my style. But hey Im not shelvin it, I will give it another listen, like I said half was ok and Im sure it will grow on me. If it doesnt though, this might be the first CMR album I sell back."
5,Excellent release from former Talk Talk band members,"After the dissolution of Talk Talk, this work extends thier foray into organic, experimental music."
4,cheery color,"A cheerful book which lives up to the promise of its cover, while it could be used by an absolute beginner. The projects are repetitve of a few simple ideas. What lifts this from the ordinary is the inspiring advice/instruction to make a few extra blocks and use a design wall to pick and arrange for maximum effect. Each of the complete projects include color harmony suggestions that are fresh and inviting. Also, here is a gallery of quilts completed by students, using the patterns from this book. What fabulous ideas ! Each is shown as a whole, and with enlarged details. I think it's a great way to envision what you might accomplish working through one (or more) of the patterns in the book."
3,Ok but not for a newbie,I have only made 1 quilt in my short life time and I didn't even use this book to help me. This book is lovely and shows quilting as elegant as ever but for me it was so hard to fellow and understand... I just put the book to the side and did something else. :(.
5,Excellent Product!,Received product on time as promised in excellent condition. Product is a delight to use in my gourmet dishes; adds a whole new level of flavor.
3,A fingerstyle sampler,"This is essentially a collection of articles on playing fingerstyle guitar. The articles are divided into three categories, building technique, arranging for solo guitar, and using alternate tuning. The big problem with book is that it never goes very deep. There are twelve articles by eight authors. Each article is really an introduction to a topic on fingerstyle. Each of these topics could be a book itself and I would happily buy those books if written by those authors. I really felt like this book is a sampler of fingerstyle guitar.I should say something about the physical quality of the book I own. The quality is terrible. It has a flat glued spine. One would think that the publisher might know that people using the book would put the book on a music stand. To keep the pages from flipping while on the stand you need to bend the pages back a bit. Doing this myself, I already have pages falling out. Why doesn't the publisher use a stapled or spiral binding?"
5,Soft Sunny Yellow Lemon book,"This bright sunny yellow lemon book is really nice. The cover is soft to the touch and is great for your toddler. Each page focuses on 4 yellow items and has a pop up in between each page. For example the last page shows Tulips, Banana, Tractor and a Lion. It really is nice to be able to focus on one color when teaching your child colors.My daughter was given the green pear book as a gift and can now basically name each item in the book. She has a huge smile and feels like she can ""read"" Mommy a book!"
2,Not quite what I had hoped for.,"I purchased this for augering purposes. It was easy to attach to my 18 volt impact drill and everything seemed great but as soon as I had bored the hole through a 2x4 and started pulling on the drill to get it out of the hole, the attachment let go of the bit. I thought that maybe it had'nt clicked into place properly but after weeks of experience with the adapter the same problem still exists."
5,John Walker's Rhyming Dictionary is not what it might seem,"This rhyming dictionary is a closer to a proper dictionarythan than a thesaurus of rhymes. The entire contents arealphabetized from the last letter to the first. Not 'z' to 'a', but so 'glow' and 'slow' would appear next to each other. As such, this is probably the only rhyming dictionary around that is better for sight rhymes than phonetic ones. It's real value comes from not caring about rhymes at all, but instead looking for words with similar suffixes, eg all the -ism's, or when you don't remember the first letter(s), such as perhaps 'pneumatic'."
3,DJ Maj changes flava,"I own and have personally ""played out"" the first two DJ Maj cds.I'm constantly looking for great Christian hip hop to work out to. It's my time of intimacy on a deep, energizing, and contemplative level with the Lord.I'm dissapointed with this 3rd set. Only two songs really stood out for me and the rest I skipped over continually.Much love in Christ to you, DJ, but I just wasn't gettin' it."
2,We Shall overcome documentary,This documentary is a good review about the history of the song 'We Shall Overcome'. Disturbing however is the fact that not one of the songs is played in full length. There are better ways tot pay tribute to this hymn
5,Loved this Book,The Kindly Ones is a powerful story with characters and prose to match.The way Caroline Stickland writes makes the English language the most beautiful in the world.
3,not very best of.....,"It's a solid collection but not the very best of.The absence of""Fortress around your heart"" by Sting as a solo performer is a shame.""King of Pain"" and ""Wrapped around your finger"" are alsomissing somehow on this collection.If you want the very best ofboth worlds here,you will have to purchase the greatest hits ofboth individually,and then you will have the very best of both in my opinion."
5,What I Expected,"Vidi, Vini, Vici. I wanted a comprehensive collection of my favorite Police/Sting songs and this CD accomplished the task. I am enjoying the music as I write this review."
5,an apt title-this IS the very best!,"even if you own many sting and/or police cd's, this is the best compilation out there!"
1,a BIG con,"Come on guys!!! How many times can you repackage this!!! Is this because Sting sold the rights to the songs, now they're being milked? Wake up everyone - this is a big con. There are NUMEROUS Police greatest hits collections AND there has been a Sting Greatest Hits prior to this - both Police and Sting fans have been well serviced already.They were and still are great songs (The Police songs I'm talking about here - Sting's solo stuff I can take or leave it without much heartache) - leave them alone and let them live in their original packaging.There should be a law against artists putting out more than 1 of the same greatest hits. Disgraceful!"
2,"uh, I think we forgot some stuff here...","I only have one thing to say: Where is ""Fortress Around Your Heart"" on this so called best of? Stick with Stings greatest hits (fields of gold) and the best of the police instead of trying to combine them."
2,would not buy,"I love the music (I thought) of Sting and The Police but this CD is titled ""The BEST..."" I only recognized about 4 and the rest were not pleasing to listen to. When I see ""The Best"" I expect at least most, if not all, to be songs that were hits. Very disappointed. Would send it back for refund but not worth the postage."
3,"A few from ""Sting"" and ""The Police"".","Ok, there's no doubt that all of these songs are great, and I like both eras, but I can't imagine this pleasing anyone but the most extreme casual fans. You only get 6 ""Police"" songs, and one of them (the Roxanne remix) has ""Puff Daddy"" on it. Anyone that's not totally broke really needs to just get the seperate collections: Sting ""Fields Of Gold: 1984-1994"", and The Police ""Every Breath You Take: The Classics"". I like greatest hits discs myself, and that's the way to go, even for the minor fan. But again, 13 of these 14 are great."
3,Sting - with and without the Police.,"The music of Sting and the Police is difficult to fit into any music category. Is it Pop, Jazz, or even New Wave (note Fragile, Brand New Day and Desert Rose). The bottom line is, their music is quite listenable. I found on this album as with the Police greatest hits album, that some of their material is somewhat overproduced. The vocals for instance are almost secondary (eg. 'Everything Shes Does Is Magic' among others). The albums by Sting as a single artist have the vocals much more upfront.Sting wrote all the material for this 18 track 78 plus minutes recording. Personally I feel 'Roxanne' could have been omitted."
1,Not Sure If This Will Let Me Give It No Stars...,"But simply put this compilation is pointless. It sucks ass to put it bluntly. If you were going to repackage a greatest hits cd and then jumble Sting's solo crap with the Police material you could have come up with a hell of a lot better selection than this. ""Russians""? Dated and melodramatic. Don't waste your money."
2,Sting,"Although the Police were one of the most popular groups of the 80's, they broke up due to Stings's intense dislike of Mexican food. Once Sting started his solo career, he became even more popular for his bleached blonde hair. This disc updates the collection of the same name from a few years back. While some of the songs on this CD are extremely overrated and boring, a few are listenable."
3,Obviously for the casual fan,"Sting & The Police / the very best of: Covering both The Police and Sting's solo work, this single disc is inadequate to cover all their best work (or even all their hits) but for the casual fan of the group and of Sting, this disc gives them all the radio hits the casual fan is looking for (even with the weird version of Roxanne). For that purpose (and that purpose alone), this disc is the right one to get. That is why I got it and it gives me all I want from them without growing weary of them. Three Stars (3 1/2)"
1,Filters,"Items received was not what was advertised or pictured. First you do not get the 3 layer/3 color filter you expect to be Hoover. It is all white and thin. Until you read the back of the package it's for use in most Hoover product ""EXCEPT"" upright wind tunnels. Item is virtually useless and too cheap to bother returning. It went from my mail to trash."
1,I did not recieve the part pictured,"I did not recieve the part pictured, although I recieve the part number. This was a part for my hoover windtunnel, but not the final filter, but the filter to prevent debris from entering the motor.The filter I recieve looked more like this filter: http://www.hoover.com/parts/?category=filters∂=38766008"
1,Filter,This filter was not the same as the original. Had to cut and piece together. I ordered for a windtunnel. It also wasn't 3 layer like picture.
1,Hoover Filter,The product shown in the pictures is not the product that was shipped. I had to go to other stores to try and find the proper filter. A complete waste of my time to use the Hoover Store on Amazon.
1,"Packaging of product says ""Not for Windtunnel""","This product is advertised as being for the Hoover windtunnel, however the packaging of the actual product says ""Not for Windtunnel"". I could cut one down to make it fit but that negates my intent, which was to have an extra on hand. Please change the advertising."
3,2 pack means two pieces,"The package contains two shorter in length final filters than the original filter with the vacumn. So you have to use both filters in the bag, cutting some off the length of the other, to get the length required to fit the opening on the vacumn. The remaining piece is small and maybe can be used a a scrub pad, for doing dishes. Although this is not the seller packaging, it is slightly mis-leading on Hoover's part to not make the filter full size, or at least state the length.."
1,I concur,"I concur that this is a one layer,single material type filter that was sent to me.You would think with all of these bad reviews Amazon would step in and investigate ."
2,Seems a bit like that time of year again,"This album features recording artists that recorded for Luke Records, run by the notorious Luther ""Luke"" Campbell, of 2 Live Crew fame. The groups featured are H-Town, U-Mynd and the Gospel Music Ministry Choir. H-Town is the only one of these groups to score a hit, which was called ""Knockin' Da Boots"". All the groups here are good singers, but the arrangements are pretty boring. It's standard 1990s ""slow jams"" R&B. The ""highlight"" is probably H-Town's ""Knockin' Boots for Christmas"", which is of course simply a retread of their big hit. I can't recommend this CD, although fans of 1990s R&B will probably enjoy it more than I did."
4,works for me,"I started using sherry vinegar for salad dressing after reading a Mark Bittman recommendation. I tried this brand first and like it enough that I'm sticking with it when re-ordering. I use 1/3 each soy sauce, olive oil and this product, and, sometimes salt, pepper, and herbs.Right now, wonderful with summer fruit salads."
1,Not well made,"I bought this item and the first time I used it the housing that holds the motor, broke. This happened when I touched the edge of a carpet. My old floor buffer would bounce away if something like that happened, not break. Hoover requested that I drive it to a service center miles away from me. I didn't do that because of the distance and location of the center. I wouldn't recommend a Hoover."
2,Poor Quality Control,After waiting one month for this saw from Amazon it arrived with a fence that was not true. Because the fence wasn't flat it could not even be adjusted to produce a square cut. I contacted Makita and they told me they couldn't ship out a new fence and my only options were to pack it up and send it back to Amazon or take it to a service center 40 miles from my house- now that's great customer service. Buyer beware!!!!!
3,unhappy,"not being able to bevel past 45 degrees is a real drag! other than that , which is a BIG deal, the saw is fine. i'm in the market for a new saw."
2,disappointing,"I'm a huge Gaffney fan with To Have and to Hold , Lilly , and Thieve of hearts being my favourite of her books. i loved the darkness about them yet sensual sexy and real! So naturally i expected the same in Forever and Ever ,sadly no though, the guy came across as lazy begging the girl for money QUOTE . ""WE DONT HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT YOU EITHER GIVE ME OR I'LL HAVE TO GO WORK"" really? go work!!!! while constantly blaming her for his roots the girl came across as really needy but at the same time snobbish , and far too much info on reform and politics rather than romance the only part i enjoyed in this book was a note she wrote to her dead father when she felt lost that did move me to tears the rest was a sure let down compared to ms Gaffney's other books it was pure torture to finish and you were still left with so many questions in the end"
2,"Interesting, but ...","The author had some very good, original ideas in this book, but I just really didn't care for the writing style.I normally would have rated this higher, but for $[money] I was expecting quite a bit more. It's ~250 pages of large print, no pictures/illustrations. If this was a $[money]paperback, I'd have no problem recommending it."
1,Don't do it!,"Tech support hell. Hours on hold. Simple gadgets should not be this tricky. The instructions are simple but my Nokia phone just could not connect, I could see it and pair with it, but it just would not work. Don't do it, ActionTec does not give a damn about customers."
3,"Nice Looking, but...","This is an attractive inexpensive tea kettle, but for a whistling teakettle, it's not very functional. You have to pretty much be on top of it to hear the whistle, even with a full pot of water at a full boil. Also, it pours out water like it's being rationed. On the plus side, water heats up fairly quickly, due to it's bell shaped bottom, and again, it's only $12 and change.There are probably better values out there. I won't be purchasing this again."
2,looks great but not easy to use,"The spout is too short and straight that it is not very convenient to pour out the water in it. The other annoying thing is it is also not easy to fill in water due to the fixed handle. The whisle sound is weak. You'll find you are doing arm excercises when you pour the water out. But for the price, it is fair."
4,Unique R/C Toy,"The title is ""Large Air Force One 2 Hand Radio Control Plane"", but I'm not sure what is considered ""large"" about it, since the plane is only about 12 inches long and as far as radio control toys go it's rather on the petite side. I gave it 4 stars because it's good looking and sturdy, bordering on basic, but interesting nonetheless. I've never seen another radio control Air Force One before, so I have to give props for the original idea."
5,Another winner from Amazon.,"Gave it to my sister's grandson and he won't let it out of his sight. I'm sure this will change but he absolutely loves it and has yet to be able to do damage to it which is a plus as he is ALL BOY. A good, durable toy that has made him more aware of his surroundings as he always points out the planes when he see one now. Definitely a good choice."
4,Good toy,"I gave this toy to my two year old , he loved it. The details of plane were really good and material is sturdy. It is very handy for small kids.The toy it self is not very big ,but the antena very long . They should have built a small nob like Antena insted of long steel wire. My little one pulled it out in two minutes."
1,it's a waste of money,Dr. Young based his recommendations on a few empirical studies done in the 80s which are not described in particular details and offered no scientific explanation of the results of those studies. (I would not consider my money totally wasted if he did so). He advocates intercourse at 6 days before ovulation to get a boy whilst most (if not all) studies suggest that a sperm cannot live that long. Good luck to those who follows his instructions
3,Book,Did not ever read this book but it came in quickly and in great condition. I did have a boy after I purchased the book so maybe just good luck.
2,Not great....But 5 year old loves it.,"My daughter got this toy for her fifth birthday in the beginning of December..she loves it. However, I find that when you rub the color over the paper to trace it, it doesn't let the picture show through very good. The picture is blurry and really leaves no way to color it and look pretty. She does love it and has played with it daily. I wouldn't have spent the money on it though."
1,I would give this no stars if I could,"My biggest issue with this book is that it is identical to the GRE book as well. It basically did a find replace for GRE to put in GMAT. It did add a few pieces of unique information for the GMAT. A huge red flag for me was that it kept talking about ETS. It talked about the test was administered by ETS including giving their contact information. Just an FYI to anyone that doesn't not realize the issue with this... the ETS lost administrating rights to the GMAT for too many testing errors in 2006! It is 2012, and has since be administered by Pearson Vue. I can't trust a book for my test prep that doesn't update its content. I did buy the Kaplan book, very helpful! I wouldn't use this."
5,Good deal,"It was shipped on time and the book is great for someone who hasn't had math for a while. It reviews many basic concepts which Kaplan and Princeton assume you know them. If one has been out of school for a while and is weak in math, this is a good book to start. If you do think you are good in math but only a little rusty I'd suggest Kaplan or Princeton."
1,Garbage,"I read some other reviews stating this book helped you. I don't know how you managed that, but cheers. There are more errors in this book than I have ever seen in a professionally published work. The answer descriptions are weak at best, and their relations to the questions asked are awkward and obscure. I made a special note to review this to warn off anyone considering the purchase. Stay away."
1,Worst book,"When I read reviews before purchasing this book, I was encouraged to buy it. But after reading it, I felt that first few sections are good and it looked that I was getting all answers correct but problems given are really too simple and not to the standard of GMAT. I wasted my time in reading this book. I wish I had not purchased this book. I read official guide combined with Kaplan and Princiton which helped me a lot. Now I am in doing MBA at Harvard."
4,"A VERY DECENT BOOK""",Basically if you would like to have good book which teaches you fundamental principles then it is a very good book. I did not like the SOFTWARE. But Math section is very good and very clear. If you are looking for some short cut then this is not the real book. But you would like to work hard and prepare for the high and medium difficulty questions then this is good book. But DONT buy this book for the software. For the software GMAT POWERPREP will be the best in my opinion.
5,Tough but outstanding!,"Tough but outstanding!This is an excellent book. I think it will put you over the top in the math section of the GMAT (the only part I studied). Many of the book's questions are brutal and, in fact, the author says that 10% of the book's questions are more difficult than any you will find on the GMAT. This will greatly increase your skills as well as confidence. I would recommend however that you also purchase Kaplan's GRE/GMAT workbook (another excellent book) to supplement Nova's. I would start with Kaplan which seems to assume less math knowledge in the reader and then move on to Nova. Nova has 22 math sections and unlike any other GMAT book that I've seen, it has an entire section on Defined Functions. I think this book will impart confidence in the test taker also. Working these problems will have you telling ETS to 'Bring it on!' This book is well worth the money!"
3,"Good for math, poor for sentence correction","This book's mathematics review, depsite some obvious errors, is useful and provides a somewhat more challenging and more representative set of algebra word problems than does Princeton Review's off-the-shelf book. The sentence correction review, however, is poor: some of its answers are simply wrong (I speak as a former writing tutor) or are simply unrepresentative of the questions of the real GMAT. Princeton Review and Kaplan both provide far superior preparation for sentence correction questions."
3,A good party video to play to some comic music.,"What's most interesting about this video is the antique footage. The older and very heavy stock cars provide some interesting off-roading on the dirt tracks, though there aren't quite so many pile-ups. I was rather pleased with the early F1 and stock car films, if video qualtiy isn't a big issue, and this DVD works up through the decades quite steadily. What was quite disappointing is the lack of modern footage, as the coverage stops in the late 70's, and the fact almost all the natural sound has been patched over with crummy snippets from a generic sound effects CD, as well as the obviously inexperienced narrator (who is easy to ignore, thankfully). There's also a let-down for auto fans, as the whole ""side B"" is reserved for repetitive, unnarrated clips of people slipping off their motorbikes. The bikini contest is hardly tame and has some good camera shots. Overall, a good party video, if you cut the audio and run music in the background. :)"
4,A classic historical analysis of Hungarian Jews,"McCagg's work is the classic historical analysis of the unusual situation of Hungarian Jews in the late 19th-early 20th centuries. Although he overstates the connection between ""nobility"" and ""genius,"" he highlights important issues about the status of Jews in Hungary during this period."
3,NO! unless you have friends with an XBOX,the only purpose I found for having this is NONE! XBOX has a hard drive to save everything to. Made for those who have friends with XBOX and want to trade/load/share their info with them. Everyone I know has a PS2. This serves me no purpose fro now.
3,Use the memory card for game data backup insurance,"There is a more compeling reason to buy a memory card...when your xbox breaks down. Because all of your achived levels and player stats are stored on the internal hard drive, if you ever need to send in your xbox for repair, there is a significant chance that they will wipe the hard disk clean and/or update the OS, or replace it with a new hard disk if that was the cause of the failure. This would result in *ALL* of your game data being lost and you would then need to re-play *all* of your games for dozens of hours just to get to where you were before the xbox broke.So, I'm getting this memory card and doing ""backups"" every so often so if the xbox ever breaks, I won't loose my game data."
4,A Definite Necessity,"Many people will ask,""Why would anyone waste their hard earn money on a TINY 8MB memory card when there is a HUGE (and free) 8GB hard drive in the X-Box?"" The answer comes in two parts. Firstly, if the system ever breaks down for any reason, there is a good chance that your ""free"" hard drive will be erased, or your memory will get corrupted (this actually does happen, it happened to me). Second of all, it is the only way to share or move important game data (I discovered the wonders of personalized data while playing HALO with a system link, which I highly recommend as being the single best gaming experience ever). Buying a thirty dollar memory card might sound a bit frivolous, but if you already payed [a lot of money] for the system, and a ridiculous amount on games an peripherals, it is a well spent insurance plan."
2,Wish I read the other reviews first!,"I gave this book a token 2 stars because I wasn't actually able to try any of the trails for myself...So, I don't know how good the trail maps or descriptions are. All I can report is that there isn't anything here for those of us in the soutern part of the state! For mountain bikers in S. Jersey, I recommend Bob Di'Antonio's ""Mountain Bike America: Greater Philadelphia Area."" This book covers some S. Jersy rides as well as nearby Philadelpha and Eastern Pennsylvania."

2,Not what I was expecting,"The shorts are well made and comfortable; however, the padded area is not up to par. After only a 10 mile bike ride I was sore and blistered."
1,ILL-Fitting Pad,"We returned these due to the fact that the padding was misplaced. It sat too low in the shorts, so it caused a crease through the center of the crotch. Not only unattractive, but also ruins the point of the padding. They also sat very low in the waist in the front and high above the mid back in the rear. We were highly disappointed. They did seem well constructed and arrived in a timely manner."
2,Poor Quality Bike Shorts,"These bike shorts have almost no padding. So, if all you want is stretch, buy these:o( But sixteen words isn't enough to write a review, so I added this meaningless sentence."
3,Good for short rides,"I just used this biking shorts today riding my road bike Cannondale CAAD8. It feels good for the first 1 1/2 hrs. After that, it goes downhill. This item needs more pads. I weight 150 lbs. Maybe this cycling shorts is for lighter people. I would recommend this shorts for shorter rides."
1,uncomfortable shorts,"I bought this biker's shorts a few weeks ago, I am very disappointed with it. The design is very poor, the edge of the padding is very irritating to a point where it created blisters on my skin. If you are riding shorter distances it is okay, but for long rides consider getting a different brand. I have other brands of bikers shorts like IP and love them."
1,waste of money,"Lets face it, we wear these shorts to save our bottom and these do not accomplish the task. There is almost no padding. It is soft thin barefoam and gives no protection. A total waste of money."
2,Too big!,"I read and checked the size suggestions, and even though I ordered what should've been my size, it was too large. I have a 33"" waist and ordered a large (which was suggested for a 32-34"" waist). It was much to large, and the padding was hanging down...I felt like I was wearing a too big diaper that I took a dump in."
3,Padding leaves a lot to be desired.,Every thing else is right with these shorts aside from padding which feels like a piece of cardboard in your pants. I've washed these about 20 times and they're just starting to soften up.
3,You get what you pay for,"I found the fit to be odd, both too tight at the cuffs and baggy elsewhere. They're also very thin and a bit more... revealing than other similar shorts.The chamois is comfortable, thin and soft.Aside from a few small issues, they're great. Just don't expect high-end tailoring or materials."
4,Sizing runs big,"Bought these and they are quite nice but had to return them as they run a little big, the XXL was quite loose on me (6'00"" and 325lbs). The pair I got was not like the pictured one with the Canari logo on it though, it had the words Canari (small) on it on each side of the thigh. They look like good quality and are comfortable. looking forward to the XL's."
3,Just fine...,"These shorts are just fine. They're not the greatest cycling shorts I own, but not the worst. These aren't compression shorts. Just spandex with elastic around the legs. The padding is again, not fantastic, I wouldn't wear it for a century, but it's just fine for shorter rides.That's about it. Pretty average. They look pretty cool, and they're made well for what they are."
4,it fit,"it fit though not as thick as the one we took out,but made from the same material and not the same color"
2,Not to my taste,"A friend of mine loves this author and recommended his writings to me. Trusting his judgement, I bought several of them and this was my first read. I note that the commercial reviewer says that these books are an acquired taste..like a Guinness Stout. If so, he could not have picked a better description as I have never been able to stomach it. This book was not that bad..but quite frankly, I don't know what all the fuss is about."
3,A Blessing!!,A truly wonderful music ministry. An encouragement for all who have ears to hear!L.Webb
4,Works great.,"I did receive two belts as pictured, but they are generic belts, not the Genuine Hoover belts shown.Oh well, they seem to work fine, and were very cheap. We'll see if they last three years like the real thing."
1,Don't get! Won't work with the Hoover.,"Despite the product description, it does not fit the Hoover. Had to go to a vacuum store where they had the correct belt."
3,Photo and Description are wrong,"I love this vacuum and would buy it again if I need to. You will need these belts too sooner than later as one other reviewer noted as they do slip off. They will usually slip off if too much pressure is put on beater bar. Once this starts, your time is limited.I only gave this three stars as the image shows two belts and only one arrived, and the description says ""two vacuum bags"". I admit I could have verified with seller, but I just had to get it done and for the price and free shipping (Amazon Prime), I wasn't going to wait for responses."
2,Really????,Just like his other book what a waste of money. Purchasing higher number of books does not equal more information. So far both the books I read from Gene are very similar.
1,Do Not buy!!!,"I bought this tv refurbished from phillps outlet. It looked great. great picture. Worked for 2 days!!! Then same as others will not turn on, flashing red light. nothing works! Called factory service waiting for them to get back in touch with me. since no repair sites are within 50 miles of me, they cant have anyone come to fix it. I am out of there operating radius. Do not buy spend the extra money on a better tv!"
2,"No Picture, No Service from Philips","Shortly after purchasing this model from Philips directly, we began experiencing drop-out of the picture for 10-15 second intervals. These continued and finally, the TV stopped turning on (or took several minutes to turn on). Red blinking lights on the front panel. Philips service was not hard to deal with, but when we got to the authorized service center, they could not even estimate when a part would be available. Philips was completely non-responsive, refusing to even discuss alternatives. We now have a dead set and no recourse. In fairness, when the set worked, it had excellent picture quality, but it is now a large, shiny object on the wall. If you buy a Philips product, follow some of the other advice and purchase it from a dealer with a no-hassle return policy; otherwise you may be very sorry!"
5,word world is exellent for children,my husband and i think this is the best show out there for children to watch! if our child watches t.v. we would love it if she could learn something at the same time and this show allows that and we love that!
1,POS,"I bought this product for my Sansa e260. I had read things like ""CD quality,"" and ""works great!"" These couldn't be further from the truth. Remember the days of cassette tapes where you would listen to your favorite tape 1,000 times? That's what it sounds like...and that's provided you don't have any interference. You have to turn up your sound system so loud that if you accidentally switch modes to CD for instance, you will undoubtedly blow your speakers. This product sucks."
4,"""The Fairest Fowl"" ...Great up close photos!","I recieved ""The Fairest Fowl"" is one of my favorite poultry type books because it's classy and informative on certain show breeds.the pictures are top quality and show every color of the breeds.They have little color charts for each breed to show color types for their eggs, feathers and such.I think this book is a great display book for your coffee table! Wonderful!"
5,A champion book,"I was absolutely charmed by this book. The text and beautiful color photos take you into the world of unusual chickens and the people who breed and show them. If you are fond of barnyard animals, you will love this book."
1,Busted at the seams!,"This book has great pictures but I had to return it because the pages were falling out. The binding was loose. When Amazon replaced the item. The problem was the same. I will be returnng it this time for a refund. FIX THE BINDING, THE PAGES ARE COMING OUT OF THE BOOK. IT'S BUSTED AT THE SEAMS!"
1,A FATHER'S CHRISTMAS GIFT TO HIS DAUGHTER,My father gave my sister this book for Christmas the year before her son died in a terrible car accident. She was in the middle of a difficult divorce from her husband.
5,Love the book. Gave it away to a friends child. They loved it also. Sally Molock,The book was so well illustrated and colorful. Story was real scary. What a unique book.Sally Molock
5,The beginnings of a journey,"I read this book when I was 10 years old and it launched me on a path I wouldn't have expected. After reading this book, I became engrossed in anything to do with the weird and unusual. I am the Director of the Texas Bigfoot Research Center and we investigate Bigfoot sightings in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas & Louisiana."
3,scared the bejeesus out of me at 12,"i found this book in reprinted form in my local library a few years back, and was a little disappointed to re read what i remembered so vividly as a scary and impossible to put down tome. i was surprised at how little actual research was done other than relating purely anecdotal material, although i guess with such topics as mothmen and ufo's, it's hard to always have a camera on hand at just the right time to prove your story. plus, the rather ham fisted writing style of mr. keel, coupled with stories that tend to meander from their subject, takes away from what could have been a more compelling read in another writer's hands. still, the interest it evoked for the unknown then (and today) cannot be denied. more interesting as a meditation of what might be out there than a document of hard facts, this collection of stories definitely gets the ball rolling in provocative way when it comes to the paranormal."
2,"Not as good as kfd, to say the least",I first heard this album at a friends house. I didnt like the fact wasp we're trying to be another megadeath. I wouldnt recommend this one.
3,Tough but will break over time,"I work in the field of corrections where I use my keys hundreds of times a day. This product lasted about 6 months, longer than any other retractor I've had before. While it is a tad overpriced, it does do the job. Still, I would like to find one that can stand up to abuse for a least a year."
4,Good could be better,Device does as promised I wish the producer would quiet it up a bit. It does rattle some while walking with my rangefinder hooked to it. I usually wait until I'm on stand to connect it to limit noise.
2,What happened?,"I bought a Nikon 8172 Retractable Rangefinder Tether on July 7, 2010. It's a very nice product and looks sturdy enough for what I wanted it: carry 7 keys (office, home, and car).It worked well until suddenly it got stuck. I couldn't pull the cable out again. That was on September 13, 2010.It did a good job for 2 months and 6 days, but I expected more. I will not be buying other one of these to replace it."
3,Nikon 8172 Retractable Rangefinder Tether,"this item worked as discribed but overprised. i'm using it to tether my Bushnell rangefinder while bowhunting from a tree stand. there are other products out there that perform the same for a lot cheaper cost. i should have done my ""homework"" before buying this item."
1,You get what you pay for,"Yes it's cheap, but it's too big for anyone but those with giant hands. It also occasionally hiccups, causing the Xbox to generate an error message. This was observed in both Halo and DOA3. Pressing the ""start"" button on the controller resets the error. This controller is a complete waste of $... bucks. Move along."
2,bad controller,This controller is a cheap imitation of the official Microsoft controller. The joysticks are less accurate and you need to press the buttons HARD or else they don't work. My recommendation to you would be to spend the extra few bucks to buy the Microsoft controller instead.
3,It's OK,"I picked up this controller because while I love Microsoft's controller, I dislike it's $40 price tag. So decided to go with a 3rd party controller and this one seemed to have some appeal.It's ever so slightly larger than the Xbox controller, but I didn't notice it when holding it. I did notice that my fingers rested differently on the triggers, but that made no difference in my playing.It's a handsome controller, but it does have two faults. The rumble seems weak compared to the Xbox controller, and the buttons must be pressed hard to get a response. I'm hoping the button issue is simply new button stiffness that will work itself out over time; indeed, it had gotten better over the first couple of hours I used it.Would I buy a second one? Probably not, but then I'm a perfectionist and I love the Microsoft controller. But if you want another controller on the cheap (side), this is probably a good way to go."
1,JUST BUY MICROSOFT'S,"I bought this controller because $... is a lot for a controller, but it was not worth it and I am going to just go out and end up buying a Microsoft controller anyway. I have to hit the buttons REALLY hard to get them to work. If you spent $... on the Xbox, just spend a bit more for a controller to make the Xbox playable. It's worth it in the long run."
1,It's like picking the longer straw,"I had a friend buy me this cheaper XBox controller so that I had more than two controllers to play multiplayer. The only reason why this deserves the one star it has is because it's a joke trying to decide who gets to use this awful piece of poo. The controller is slightly bigger than the original controller with the grips turned more inside, providing for an even odder grip. The buttons stick and are very unresponsive. Spend the extra money and buy the original or the S."
1,Controller doesn't work right,"I got this controller and am very dissapointed with it since it simply doesn't work correctly. The buttons require too much force to push down making it very unresponsive, the force feedback doesn't feel quite right, and it sometimes just says that the controller is disconnected. Don't buy this, spend the extra few dollars for the actual Microsoft one, it works much much better."
3,"Nice, Cheap, but questionable quality.",The Power Pad for XBox by Interact is one the cheapest third party controlers currently avaliable for the system. This controller sports essentially the same configuration as the Microsoft branded controler and is similar in size. As an entry level controller for the casual gamer or for someone who just needs extra controlers for say a multiplayer match of the very popular Halo game for XBox. Then the Power Pad is the way to go. However for the serious gamer this is not an option as I found this gaming pad to be not as responsive as the Microsoft branded controlers. The main buttons need to be pushed directly instead of being able to just tap them. I also noticed that the controler itself was not as sturdy as the analog sticks were lose and you could press in on them to easily. However with the responsivness issues aside I found the Power Pad to be an adaquet controler.
2,it's ok price wise only!,"to tell you tha truth, i feel i waisted my money, it doesn't have pressure sensitive analog buttons, and an error message comes up on all my games when still plugged in, do not buy this! get tha pelican x-wing controller or the mad catz advanced. both having pressure sensitive buttons."
1,Go with Microsofts,"it is what it is:cheap. microsofts may be (dollar amount) dolars more, but it works better. If you have smaller hands, and the normal one is two big, than buy it. Otherwise, stick with microsoft's."
5,"One more, please!","The other day I was at...store and I check out Xbox's controller and play NFL and I found it easy to controll the play with having to move around to find the right button for the play and very comfortable! Unlike Sony SP and Sega Dreamcast where you have to fight your way to find the right button. Meaning holding on to the controller without losing your grap as you press the right button. Dreamcast gave me pains in my hands from holding it in a uncomfortable way. Sony was better! But, Xbox is excellent!!"
1,Sigh...,I used this poor excuse of a controller at EB. It's so fat and very uncomfortable. Once I used it I ran as fast as I can to the restroom to wash my hands. Stick with Sony kids =). Trust me.
5,.o.rang's Fields and Waves: this field is private,"""Fields and Waves,"" .O.Rang's followup to the album ""Herd of Instict,"" seems a masterpiece in so many ways. Paul Webb and Lee Harris, formerly of the 80s group Talk Talk, bring a wonderful array of exotic instruments into a sort of bluesy, electronic atmosphere. They even create their own ""instruments"" using programming, layering, and lots of expirimentation. Some "".O.riginal Treated Instruments"" include acoustic guitars and basses. Some tracks include the kindly layered ""P.53,"" the groovy ""Jalap"" and the fun piece, ""Hoo."" This album is a great accomplishment by Webb and Harris, just as Herd of Instinct is. Anyone who's a fan of Talk Talk should listen to this disc, as should followers of industrial artists such as Tool and nine inch nails.-Bill Washburn (indigae)"
4,"a challenging, near great album","Put this on while you're doing chores around the house, then sit and listen to it all the way through. It will first grow on you, then sneak all the way into your system and stay there. The first and sixth songs on the CD immediately arresting, the rest of it challenging at first and then ultimately worthwhile. This is a very good record."
4,Perhaps The Best Overview of History,"I've looked at a number of overviews of world history and this is my favorite. It's written with great knowledge and a balanced viewpoint. I really like that the causes and mechanisms of history are presented and not just a stream of facts. It's told with emphasis on the general not the detail - there's no page long sidebars on Michaelangelo for instance. There's lots of statistics and maps to show how the world was changing. The other book of it's type that I really liked is ""Rise of the West"" by William McNeil which has a similar outlook."
2,Not my kind of history book.,"History books should be engrossing, thought provoking and colorful This book is dull and boring from the minute you open the front cover. I truly hope this is no longer assigned to any students anywhere."
5,superb,The contain in this book is perfectly qualified as a textbook for adolescents. I love it and the personal opinions of the late author.
3,Rehash but still worth the cash,"This is a disturbing trend in the prolific dancehall artist category. Most of the tracks from this album first appeared on an album called Toe 2 Toe Vol. 3 featuring about 9 tracks each from Sizzla and Capleton. I counted a total of 6 new tracks on this album (Movements, Mass Media, Mankind, Woman Dem A Gwan, Burn Dem Down, and No Time). They are decent. The best IMHO is Burn Dem Down as it is very rough and brings back the deep cuts of Capleton's edge.Looks like Capleton can't keep up w/ his main man Sizzla. Not that Sizzla doesn't do the same trick with one or two tracks on occasion."
5,Uncle Dudley Rocks!,"I stayed up far too late finishing this book because I enjoyed it so much. Unlike most middle grade books, this one does not wallow in the usual death/disease/divorce/drugs themes. Instead, it presents the relationship between 11-year-old Dundan Peckle and his mysterious rascal of an uncle, a man who has many tales of his adventures around the world. But sometimes the details aren't quite right, and that makes Duncan wonder...Uncle Dudley performs magic but different from that found in Harry Potter. In fact, Uncle Dudley's potions result mostly in chaos, causing friction with his nephew Duncan, who increasingly yearns for his uncle to live up to his exotic stories.There's a lot of gentle humor here and a little slapstick too, especially when Uncle Dudley and Duncan try their hands at flying on bubbles. I highly recommend this book to middle grade readers, especially boys, who should enjoy Duncan's first-person narration."
1,Failure,I bought this item cause it was a name I know. It wasn't the cheapest but it did have the name I trusted. I thought they would stand by their product. Not only did Delphi screw me with their return policy but I won't buy from Amazon any more. The return policy was only a month. I tried to save a buck and the part isn't working rite and it is only 5 months after I bought it. Screw them and Amazon for automotive parts.
4,Is what it is and does what it should,This is an original part. So it does what it is supposed to do. What else can I say.
4,Interesting Collection,"The Full Frame documentary shorts collections always provide an array of interesting perspectives and innovative approaches to the documentary film. The films include:""Afloat""--a unique take on old age.""The Angelmakers""--about a group of women in Hungary who murdered their husbands in the 1920s, becoming somewhat legendary.""High Plains Winter""--a beautiful and surprising look at the West in winter.""Send Me Somewhere Special""--a personal journey of English conversations.""Stand Like Still Living""--African bushmen dealing with AIDS crisis--particularly affecting for those who recall with affection the film ""The Gods Must Be Crazy.""""The Intimacy of Strangers""--an new use of cell phone conversations.All in all, once again, a collection well worth viewing."
5,Thimbleberries by Lynette Jensen,The Pint-size traditions from Thimbleberries about 20 projects meant to be either wall hangings or table toppers. The instructions are easy to follow and the pictures are great and it color. Several of these are seasonal projects so you can make many and have them out for a short amount of time.Sandy
4,Great deal,I'm Not a jewelry person...but I like the look and the feel..I have big wrists and didnt think it woudl fit but...fits perfect...like a glove and very happy with purchse...Shipping was fast. Almost wish I had a watch on it but I dont really like watches..
5,"Great bars, ridiculous price","These are the best protein bars I've ever had. High protein to calorie ratio and low sugar content. Very good if your trying to get protein with few calories. They are also the best tasting I've ever had. However, the price on Amazon is unbelievable. I buy this exact carton of 5-6Oz bars for $1.89 at my local grocery store. Don't buy these off Amazon, but they are definitely worth buying at a store with reasonable prices."
5,A voice so pure is usually reserved for angels; rarely imparted to humans,"When I first Heard Gloria Melancon sing, It was in a jazz club in Atlanta, and I cannot remember a better evening as a member of an audience. Her intuitive understanding of what a singer is, and how the voice should be wrapped in the music was enough for me to decide to buy a new sound system so I would not miss one decibel of her magnificent interpretation. Her magnetic personality really comnes through on I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and my heart broke listening to BUT NOT FOR ME. Add this to your collection and you will say Gloria Melancon had her way with you too."
3,Agree with some below...long for days of old,"There seems to be a divide in Guster fans. Those who just started to listen around the time of Keep it Together are going to like this album more than those of us who have been hanging out since the beginning. Guster's two best albums (Goldfly and Lost and Gone Forever)are on a different level than KIT and GUOTS. While I enjoy this album, even Keep it Together caught my attention more than this...at least Keep it Together had ""Red Oyster Cult""...now that song keeps true to the unique music that Guster produces...I have yet to get that feeling from a song on Ganging Up on the Sun"
2,Take the elevator,"I was a little concerned after the last Guster album. Keep It Together had some nice moments but also showed signs of a major label trying to make a unique and interesting band conform to some narrow-minded idea of what people want to hear on the radio. But I thought that perhaps the success of that album would give Guster some leverage to make the next album their way. ...sigh... I guess it was not to be. This album is so uninteresting, uninspired, un...Guster. Where are the harmonies that were a trademark of their earlier albums? Where is the interesting percussion? Ganging Up On the Sun could have been made by any run-of-the-mill alt-commercial band. Of course, even with the mis-guided production, great songs could have saved this effort, but the songs are almost all uniformly dull. I think my wife's comment said it best: ""I've heard more exciting music in an elevator""."
4,"Not Guster's Best, But Still A Great Album","In my opinion, this doesn't QUITE live up to the incredibly high standard of most of Guster's previous work, but that certainly does not mean its a bad record. On the contrary, its quite a joy to listen to. If I hadn't heard any of Guster's other work before this I would probably give it 5 Stars, but knowing what they're capable this falls JUST short of the mark. Truly if I could, I would rate it more of a 4.5, I still highly suggest buying this album."
3,Unimpressive,"I was disappointed with this album, having bought and enjoyed most of Guster's previous work. Reviews may rave about how Guster has increased its diversity of sound, but I find I miss the characteristic bongos and complex vocal harmonies that gave their earlier work its quirky dynamism. Most songs on ""Ganging Up On The Sun"" start with an intriguing opening line and catchy hook. However, there are far fewer verses per song than on ""Keep It Together"" or ""Lost and Gone Forever"" - the tracks seem to consist mainly of repeated choruses and long instrumental bridges. Consequently, they're short - about 2.5 minutes on average. ""Satellite"" could have been a fantastic song had it not fallen prey to these pitfalls, and I feel the same applies to most tracks on the album."
3,they'll be back,"Remember the phase REM went through when they put out MONSTER? Heavy and plodding songs that left your memory soon after their first and last listen? There were a couple of good songs, but the light and beautiful melodies were gone. The harmonies were replaced with loud guitars and banging drums. Well, What's the frequency, Kenneth? It's Ganging Up on the Sun. There are some gems...The Captain and Empire State are examples of what makes Gster so great. Bouncy creative beats and painfully beautiful vocals. Beyond that, I'm left a little bit disappointed. It sounds like they were trying to 'rock'. I was not ""Happier"" finding this out."
4,So Glad to Have My Guster Back,"I discovered them with Keep it Together--which I loved. Then I went backwards. It's nice to know that Guster hasn't done the same thing. They have grown, matured--musically, lyrically--and I couldn't be happier. Manifest Destiny has a catchy hook, and One Man Wrecking Machine just draws you in from the first note. The Captain and Lighning Rod also have great sound. But nothing can top Ruby Falls, which takes Come Downstairs and Say Hello (from KIT) and escalates the emotion, the drive, and the vocal energy. But overall there is a new-found power to the music, with its rich layers and tones, yet still maintains the vocal harmony we've come to love. Guster is just plain great. Ganging up on the Sun will play on my iPod all summer long--and beyond."
2,Bought this for 1 song,"Bought the entire album for one song, ""One man wrecking machine,' and I should have just bought the mp3 single."
3,Ganging Up on the Sun,"I like that Cd in all but it needs some changes so you will get an award, okay, so do good and you will get it. I like to say that you are great singers and I hope you will win the award so I like Guster. Guster is the best. I am your fan too. Thank you for so much and I will support you and i'm always with you."
2,one good song,"I enjoyed one song on this CD; that's why I bought it. Try to guess which one (you can preview the CD for free). It's now heavy rock and roll, and most of the music is not really very high quality. On the other hand,it's not junk either."
2,"Just ""eh"" compared to Guster's earlier albums","This album marks Guster's transition into a more mainstream pop band. The bongos have disappeared from the album, as well as all creativity. There are a couple catchy songs on this album, but nothing compared to the old Guster we knew and loved."
3,Blocking the shine,"It's easy to dismiss the band of being derivative of so much Britpop, and for some songs I easily do, but there is still a smooth-going consistency here that makes it all go down relatively painless, with a few numbers achieving far more than that."
4,Guster's Best,"Absolutely terrific album. It has more of an acid rock feel than their previous work, and it is masterfully done. Their other albums are good but this one has way more replay value to me. All in all less pop and more classic rock. Way to go Guster!"
3,the item itself is nice but both were rather scratched up,i ordered 2 of these - the price was reasonable and the shipping time was reasonable but both items had a few knicks and scratches on the outside tat i wasnt so fond of
1,You get what you pay for,"Many times, I've come across great deals on Amazon where I've paid just little for a lot. This is NOT one of those moments. This pan feels like it's made from three layers of tin foil. It's shockingly flimsy."
5,Splendid illustrations create warm atmosphere!,Fred Banbery's illustrations make Paddington's Garden a treat! The original hardback edition has a warm lemon yellow cover showing Paddington's garden! The adventures that Paddington has making his garden are true to his unique personality. The illustrations bring to life the atmosphere of the Brown family home and their love for the little bear who lives with them!
4,"Good product, but pricey","The 3Com Airconnect Wireless LAN PCMCIA card is reasonably good. In my rather large single story home (>5000 sq. ft.), I can get 80% coverage. ...You get a 802.11b wireless card that gives you reasonable coverage, good speed, and great support. I had problems installing it and 3Com support was great, a lot better than Linksys or SMC, though it is only available during business hours. Mine connections to a 3Com HomeConnect Wireless Gateway , with virutally no setup required. I highly recommend this if you are using newbie building a new home network and need support. However, if you know what you are doing, and don't care about service or support, you might want to save a dollars with something from Linksys or SMC. Remember, you get what you pay for."
2,Difficulties...,"I have tried to install my 3COM AirConnect PCMCIA card three times without success. The instructions I used wasn't very clear. I ended up just using all defaulted parameters, rebooted, then it would work. However, it only connects to the internet once, with very weak connection indicated. It would not thereafter. Is there an easy way of installing and using this PC card (for Windows 2000)?"
1,This vacuum ... and not in a good way.,"I have this model and it is the bane of my existence. It's true it is relatively quiet, but that's because it doesn't work. It has the power of an asthmatic mouse. Hoover is a great brand, and one that can be trusted. but this vacuum is wretched. I just think that this is their Edsel."
1,Vacuum not worth the price,"The Hoover S3510 is one of the worst purchases I have made in years. Although it is inexpensive compared to some other vacuums, it is still a waste of money. It has almost no suction power at all. It barely cleans bare floors, and does not work on rugs at all. It has cheap cheap cheap plastic parts. The chord holder is stupidly designed, and hardly holds the wound-up chord in place. The only thing good about this vacuum is that it is relatively quiet"
1,not a good buy vacuum is very cheep and has flaw design,"Found that vacuum was very cheep , had very poor suction and had a flaw design ,it leaks suction out through the lid and there is not all that much to begin with. Did not like vacuum at all. Infact I sent it back and choose another vacuum."
2,A waste of money for me.,"I wanted a compression top for my son who is autistic. Even though it is listed as a compression shirt , it is not. The compression top applies gentle pressure on all the joints, from all directions, and it helps kids with autism to focus. I am looking for an alternative to the name brand SPIO as I am on a fixed budget. To return it would cost me half or more of the original price. Sizing is also a problem."
4,Nice & Warm,I felt this product was worked as it was designed. I purchased this for my Step-daughter for the cold season of soccer. She says it kept her extremely warm. She really liked them.
4,Great TV for the money,This is my 3rd LCD screen and I did not buy this from Costco but directly from Amazon. I do not have any issues with the sound or picture.My setup is a follows:Time Warner HDTV per Explorer 9300HD boxLG DVDBoth are hooked up per HDMI.There are some issues with the Explorer box but that is due to HDCP and HDMI not the TV.I upgraded the firmware per USB as per philips' website but did not notice any improvements.I have used the USB input to view pictures and had no issues.My main issue is that it takes 15 seconds for the TV to turn on. not major but I am impatient.Even SDTV looks good which is not always the case I understand.You do need HDTV signal if you really want to experience the quality of the TV though.HB
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I did not purchase this particular tv, I purchased another one. But Philips customer service has been so terrible I have to write. There is no supervisor, the is no accountabilty and rudeness. I have faxed them my warranty three times, they always claim they didn't recieve it and emailed them twice and called numerous times. It took a MONTH to get someone to come look at my TV and it's still not fixed. I""ll miss the Superbowl because of those idiots. Don't deal with this company."
4,"Good hardware, lousy software","I'm more than satisfied with the picture quality of this unit, but the firmware is really crappy. When I bought this unit, it would ""remember"" my ""favorite"" channels the next time that I turned it on. I upgraded to the next firmware version, and I would no longer remember any changes that I made to my favorites. I ""downgraded"" to the original and left it there. Today I upgraded to the latest version and it ""lost"" half of my digital channels - I can't even access them directly. Lesson learned - NEVER change firmware on a Philips product - they have NO quality assurance."
4,An old fashioned english story,"""A Very Naughty Girl"" is written in the moralistic style of the early nineteen hundreds. The Wynfords of Wyndford Castle are forced to welcome a sixteen year old Evelyn into their home. She is the niece of Squire Wynford and the heiress of the Wynford estate. Evelyn was not raised with the good breeding of Squire Wynford's own daughter Audrey and is therefore a somewhat unpleasant addition to the household. The story also features the more honorable Sylvia Leason and her struggles living with her miser father. As the two stories intersect, Evelyn shows herself to be a willful and dishonest girl whose deeds cause much strife and hardship while Sylvia struggles to survive. I enjoyed the story even with its overuse of exposition and the unrealistic perfection of some of its characters' traits. The ending is happy and I enjoyed the English landscape."
2,GOT A QUESTION!,"Hope someone could help me-I bought this RF adaptor, hooked it up to a used XBOX, and noticed when I start the XBOX that I didn't have any color on my TV. I can get color by switching the channel then switching back, or waiting for awhile. Also noticed, at one point the color was switching on and off while I was playing a game. The TV is old, and not real good quality, but I had no trouble with an RF adaptor hooked up to a SONY PS1 with the same TV. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem. Any info would be appreciated.Thanks"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I rec'd this book in 1997 and have relished it ever since. It's a wonderful read and gives great insight into the last 80 or so years. Ellis died in 1998, but his books leave a lasting legacy."
3,Not in as great a condition as I had hoped...,"i had a hard time finding this book in good condition (as a hardcover) and i had to take the seller's word for it. the book itself seems to be in good condition, pages clean, with just a small amount of wear on the ends. the dust jacket was billed as having some ""rub marks""... well... it did... it was also ripped in several spots at top and bottom as well as some indentations in the middle of the front of the jacket. there was also a small price tag on the back that i did manage to get off (and the residue). for a used book, it is in pretty decent shape - but it was intended as a gift, so i had hoped that the dust jacket would be in better shape"
1,THE EPICENTER!,"bought this item and was going to be a Christmas gift but i went to shop to install it just to find out it wasn't working, probably the shipping damaged it!"
1,did'nt work as expected,one of the outputs are blow it makes a distorted noise so i need to continue using my music without this unit i just got 2 weeks out of this item
1,Not Good,"The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies. It drove me nuts. I had to return it."
2,DVD operation is very poor,"While the price for this HTS is very nice, the performance is substandard. There's a hissing sound when the unit is off. The DVD player has trouble playing DVDs. I have a large DVD collection & most of them don't play. The surround quality is also very poor. It's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don't put out much sound. In order to get this serviced, I have to send it out for up to 3 months. I bought a progressive DVD player, put the audio through the Phillips HTS 3400 and the video to the TV and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better."
2,Sad! Because I have to keep it for my birthday!,"This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics. I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and A. Isaicu all talke about these problems."
4,Philips HTS3400 perfect for the price,"Hi,I recently got this system from overstock.com and put it with the Philips 23"" flat screen LCD TV I bought from Amazon.com. Together these are great. I have had no problem with the DVD play and I love having a radio tuner built in... one less appliance needed and with lovely sound. Granted, I live in a small apartment and I doubt I would turn the sound up to really take advantage of the system (don't want the neighbors calling). But for the price it is perfect and the two together look great in my home and perform very well."
3,fine print,"Under product details, it gives the language, French in this case. It should be mentioned in amazon's review, but is always worthwhile checking that books published in France for basically the French, might well be, in French.The Zagut guide also publishes a Paris restaurant guide in french, that I bought by accident. I can read french though, but it is annoying.Read the fine print is the lesson.That said, this is a great book for finding little gem places, and even if you cannot read french, you can follow stars, and read the address."
1,1 Star is to High,"Don't waste your time or money, after five minutes you have seen the whole movie. I don't know who is naked, I must have fallen asleep and missed that part."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, AND MORE JUNK","I can only wonder how someone could produce junk like this, put it in a box and expect to get money for it. They know from the beginning this is nothing more than a swindle. A couple girls will be involved in a game or contest. arm wrestling, etc. The video quality alone is reason enough to avoid this tape...its all washed out. You get 2 tapes with 30 min. of tape on each. The contestants appear to be strippers at the club in the video, they do little uninteresting dances and commence to do whatever competition is required at the moment. You will be fast-forwarding in 3 minutes, in 10 minutes you just give up. Risk the unknown elsewhere. Truth be told."
4,beautifully illustrated,"Animals and plants are realistically and beautifully drawn. My daughter, at 2&1/2yrs, loves the frog and it's fun for her to find the tiny brown mouse on each page."
4,Hard Knox,"Hard Knox is a cute fun movie that we had taped around 1986 on New Years Eve with our first VCR. The taping was not the best and we probably wore it out anyway. My son had acquired a replacement tape online but its quality was poor, worse than our worn out original.I found and purchased the DVD online from Amazon.com and have been pleased with the quality. I would rate the quality as that which would have been produced around 1986. It's not what I would call digitally remastered (probably no demand for it to be done); but the quality is quite acceptable. If the quality were digitally remastered, I would have given a 5-star rating."
3,Stump,"Just as closing credits were to start, the DVD ended. The quality of the rest of the DVD was great."
1,Doesn't work,I could not get this disc to play on my Bose 321 or on my iMac. It said the format was unreadable.
1,Hard knox,This cd was the worst condition I have seen. I taped this program from the tv and had a cleaner copy. It looks like they took an old vidio and copied it somehow. It will not play on my newer dvd players and will only play on the old one.when you by a CD you expect a clear picture. VERY Disapointed.
5,Hard Knox,"One of my favorite movies, and again Robert Conrad did a very good job, he always seems to be able to place himself in teh character better than most actors."
3,Not challenging enough for 6th graders,"I was looking for a book to give ideas to both my homeschooled 2nd and 6th graders. While the book is okay for the second grader, the projects are too simplistic and too easy for an older child. I know it says the book is for 3-6 grade, but I didn't find this to be the case.Also, most of the books mentioned in the Selected Bibliography section were way below a 5th-6th grade level. I was a little disappointed, and I guess I'll have to keep looking for art resources for pre-teens."
2,Hoover F5300 Floormax,"Problems encounter: Had to guess work on what pads to use, directions weren't clear and no instructions on how to install the pads. The container that holds the cleaning solution doesn't snap in -- had to push in with the palm of my hands which got pinched. The container that holds the cleaning solution is not as large as the other reviewers made it seem (Maybe, a gallon). The machine itself is awkward to handle, the bottom is heavy and when lifting doesn't lock in the upright position. Which slammed on my hardwood floor and ceramic tiles due to the heavy motor. The lack of instructions on how to probably use the enclosed attachments (pads), assembly and the non-lock upright feature has made this product a disappointment. I was ready to send it back but will give it a second try now that I figured out the problem areas. As for the cleaning, don't know, will give it another try."
3,have a question about this,I read the other reviews and am considering buying. But need to know if this works well for carpets too ? All the reviews seem to only talk about the Hard Floors.
3,I bought this in error...,Should of sent back but never did. Am sure I'll find a use someday. I needed the water treatment not the cleaner!
3,"An ok-read, but not her best work","This is a typical Judith Tarr novel, full of melodrama and interpersonal conflict. That's not to say that it isn't any good. The story is very well written, the characters are nicely developed, and especially interesting is the interaction between the different characters, most notably Meriamon and Niko, and Meriamon and Alexander.All the characters have been drawn richly and come alive in this story. If you want an introduction to Judith Tarr, read this book. The use of magic may put you off. Best thing to do is bear in mind this is just a story!!"
2,NOT the best,"Who is Meriamon and why was this novel wasted on her? Tarr's writing is good, and she could have done a lot with Alexander the Great's story if she had focused on him more and just left that oracle-cum-weirdo out."
4,A Gorgeous Book of Egyptian Fiction,"I bought this book on a whim at an antique store because I *love* anything to do with Egypt. Usually, I don't read all the novels I get for months or years after I get them, but for some reason I started reading this one the night I bought it.And it was wonderful. I had very many late bedtimes thanks to this book, and Tarr's delightful characters. In fact, I just finished it today, and could not have been more satisfied with the story. The interaction between Niko and Meriamon is very tempting and gives away just enough info at a time to keep the story moving. And the magic isn't too overdone (though at times could drift from historical fiction to fantasy) and is faithful to the Egyptian pantheon. All in all I thought it was an excellent book, even though it's not ""the best"" book of historical fiction I've seen. I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for some magic. :)"
2,READ SOMETHING ELSE BASED IN EGYPT OR ON ALEXANDER,"The synopsis sounded so enchanting, and the topic and setting were so promising, yet the book just doesn't get there. The main character, the heroine, is interesting, but not enough about her is divulged in the establishment of the beginning of the story. I found myself disappointed by the end, the magic was empty, the hints at magic were even more disappointing. I wonder if I will be able to pick up another Judith Tarr now."
3,Lord of the Two Lands,"Alexander the Great comes to Egypt, while Egyptian princess Meriamon and Macedonian soldier Nikolaos strive to forge a relationship.Tarr's writing flows well and her description is occasionally lovely. I found the plot a little short on action, but generally well-structured. Characters are reasonably appealing, though Tarr's Alexander lacks the sheer fire of Renault's classic portrayal, and the relationship between Meriamon and Niko never quite coalesces for me. It amused me that Egypt's rebelliousness gets sympathetic treatment, while city-states resisting Alexander are perforce black-magic practitioners and baby-sacrificers. Touches of magical elements here are sometimes a bit nebulous, though Meriamon's Anubis-shadow is a nice image."
4,heather myles,"excellent content, vocally still great, but camera work could have been better, too many long shots dissapointed, still worth the wait though"
4,Review,"Wonderful! His best video out. Also, it is great to see clips of him when he was young on various shows. Very interesting. Wonderfully done!"
4,"Johnny Mathis - Wonderful, Wonderful 50th anniversary Concert","Johnny Mathis gave his fans what they wanted, singing all their favorite songs and his beautiful voice was as strong as ever. The video was a little grainy and the sound was a little thin. I'd like to see it in blu-ray with upgraded sound."
2,Live after 50 years of performing?,"A wide range of Johnny Mathis classics and an insight into the performers life, are presented on this DVD. However the don't expect the voice to have the same freshness and clarity of old. Sadly it is without the range and subtlties of earlier recordings."
1,cannot review,"Unfortunately I have not recieved my video till to-day ? It has been almost a month. I would love to review it, if I get it by any chance ????? Tii then heres hoping.cheersBill"
2,DON'T BUY THIS CARD until Creative fixes the Volume setting,"Audigy Platinum sounds wonderful. Having the controls in the front is the obvious selling point, especially when you consider you get a free front 1394 port, BUT... I leave mine on mute at all times unless I want to hear something specific. The reason is that every time you reboot the Volume DEFAULTS TO THE LOUDEST setting, waking everyone in the house. Creative has no fix, only a ""work around"" that doesn't work. It is a pain to pay this much for a sound card and have to leave it off. Stick with what you have until they have a real fix."
1,Doesn't Work in XP!,"I have the same problem as others have reported. The Audigy Platinum installs ok but fails to work. When I tell XP to test the sound device, it tells me that XP isn't able to use the Audigy and to contact the supplier. That's a joke as Creative's ""support"" is almost non-existant. The Audigy Platinum simply doesn't work foe me in Windows XP even with their latest XP ""upgrades"" installed.If you use Windows XP, save your money. Don't buy the Audigy Platinum."
3,"Good, but not great","Had to get a soundcard for my new computer cause I didn't want to use the built in sound. I bought the Audigy because it was the newest thing out and was being touted as the best thing for audio since stereo sound.When I installed it though, the sound thru my 2 Boston Accoustics speakers was a joke. I had to turn them way up to hear anything at all. The sound was hissy and crackly. After I moved the speakers away from the monitor, the sound improved greatly, but I still have to have my system's volume turned up all the way to hear anything. I definetely expected more, but maybe if I got more expensive speakers, I might unlock the potential of this soundcard."
1,"Terrible Build, Worse Support","I purchased this card in 12/01. After a very quirky install, the card worked well for 4 months and then went dead. It took numerous phone calls to get an RA. It then took Creative 4 months to return the card, which still didn't work. A few more phone calls and a new card arrived. After working for 3 months, died. I marked the card and returned for repair/replacement. After 4 months I received the same card back, not working. I was then sent a 5.1 card that I couldn't hook-up to the front panel. I am now junking this card and trying a new product. Will never use a Creative product again. I could excuse the problems, but not the shameful lack of customer support and service."
1,Do not buy!,"Creative said that if you want to use this in Windows XP with full functionality, then you must buy an upgrade CD that will be available soon, it's 2002 and it's still not available. Right out of the box, the remote won't work and the liveware won't install, but remeber on the box, it says nothing about working with XP. And the downloadable drivers are a joke, it will crash your system, leave it on and just wait, it will go down."
4,API calls in a nutshell,"This book is an excellent little resource. It contains all the sort of utility programs you would love to get to know. Many of the programs use API calls to squeeze every bit of juice from your code. You may ask yourself before bying this, 'if that's the case why don't I buy an API programming book'. Well, you could, but this book shows API calls in neat little programs that are used so often. I spotted this book while shuffling through my father's books on holiday in Guernsey, I am now dying to get my hands on a copy. A useful tool to anyone who wants to produce efficient VB code."
4,dvd review,"I enjoyed this dvd, Randy Johnston's single line & chording style are both imaginative and well executed."
2,No what I was looking for,"It's a great tool, but based on the photo and description I expected something larger. We use this at the winery to pull grapes out of the trucks or to rake pumice. I was looking for a much larger head. Other than that it's a well built piece of equipment..."
3,"Solid SOMETHING WEIRD Compilation, A LIttle Short","It's a fine addition to the SOMETHING WEIRD DVD Collection - not a classic or great but enough nudity to warrant a solid consideration. Both movies are about ""swinging"" couples - the women are reasonable attractive and you are interested to see them nude. Most of the nude scenes are a little dark and un-imaginatively shot so that detracts a little ... Of course, there is minimal plot but nothing that really gets in the way of the nudity. Both films are about an hour long. There are three amusing 'instructional' videos for kids on how not to get your hormones in a knot, of course as school & church videos - no nudity. There is the usual slew of 8-10 fun, kooky and definitely R-rated trailers along with a short about a nudists (a nice addition as it focuses only on nubile women :-) ) so still a solid SW DVD but not one of the best but enough nudity to make it worthwhile to consider adding to your collection."
2,Dealing Creatively with Death,"There is wonderful information in this book, however, it is expressed ""dryly"". It was difficult reading due to the writer's style. Please don't take mine as the ""end all"" opinion. You know what they say about opinions...everybody's got one."
5,Thimbleberreies Oh Sew Cozy Flannel quilts,Haven't made any of the quilts in the book yet but there are several patterns I am excited to try. The patterns are easy to read and simplistic enough for me to try.
1,the forbidden,"This book was terrible!The author should have been "" forbidden"" to write this autrocity!When one thinks of vampires there is a certain allure and mysterie that accomponies the mental perception.This book disapoints!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ms. Banks put too much of her slang into the narration of the plot, therefore smashing the glamour effect of the vampire and reducing the charachters to mere street thugs!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I loved it!,"Once again, L.A. Banks delivers yet another stunning novel. I swear, I just love her sex scenes. But anyway, this book sets the record straight on many issues, now, I'm not one to give away any of the plot, so I'll just say that you need to read this book!Also recommended: I also recommend D.N. Simmons Desires Unleashed the first book of the Knights of the Darkness Chronicles. also Charlaine Harris, Southern Vampires Series."
4,Surprisingly touching story with gorgeous music,"This is one of the best westerns I have ever seen. After spending our vacation in Montana this year, this video made me yearn for that majestic loneliness and the strong sense of the importance of the individual. The unusual score also adds a mysterious, haunting quality to the film.Yes, the story is a tad rushed, but the acting is superb. For a first time director, Pullman, certainly drew touchingly realistic portrayals from the fine cast. It is interesting to note how Pullman has ""modernized"" The Virginian by making him not such the perfect ""natural man"", ala Fennimore Cooper. He is rather a man filled with a sense of anxiety and doubt, but who also has a strong sense of his own worth and duty to the people around him."
4,A great Western,"I really enjoyed this film, Bill Pullman was great in the leading role and made a fine job as director. The only reason I did not give the film five stars was because it could have been a little longer, I would have liked more time to get to know the main characters. If you like Westerns then this old style gentle film with a romantic story line is a good one to try."
4,The Virginian,"I've been waiting for this to be put on DVD format, grew tired of waiting and bought it on tape. Some people may think it a little slow and lacking action but I thought it reflected Owen Wister's novel perfectly. Bill Pullman does a great job at the title role. Diane Lane, Dennis Weaver and John Savage all lend their talents to the ensemble. The photography is beautiful. If your are looking for ""Tombstone"", you won't find it here. But if you are looking for a beautifully done ""romantic"" western with a classic ending, look no further."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This is one of the most poorly directed films I have ever seen. The story was extremely sketchy and hard to follow, and it was very hard to understand a good bit of the dialog. I love westerns, and thinking it would surely get better (it didn't), I watched it to the bitter end. The only redeeming quality I found was that it made me interested enough in the story to want to see the 1929 version with Gary Cooper (which I have yet to find a copy of) and to read the book (available here at Amazon)."
2,good and bad,"Great printer and scanner and copier, but only if you attach it to a stand alone computer system. If you have a home network with Windows XP you cannot use this machine. Can't even attach it even if you don't plan on sharing it. Windows errors and system crashes will happen. It's going back. Disappointing since Canon has no plans of writing a better driver."
2,Driver problems!,"I love the multifunction of this printer and the print comes out nice but the included software and drivers are terrible. Like some other users I have a home network and this printer presents me with nothing but problems. I have reinstalled the software at least three times and I still cant get it to print from my other computer...Also, I dont like the ""multipass status monitor"" and ""multipass toolbar"" it puts on my desktop. If I want these utilities I'll load them myself. The last thing I need is more junk on my desktop.Sorry to be so negative. For most users, this printer will probably work fine..."
3,Utility yes but missing some features,I love the utility of the 3 functions and the ergonomics. The LCD is a little tough to read. Seperate tanks for the colors is a plus for me. It is not for printing photos though. It also does not allow printing in book format as my old HP did. I really miss that. Instructions are not stellar either.
2,CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE APPRAISER,"ALTHOUGH THIS COPIER HAS A LEGAL SIZE GLASS, IT DOES NOT SCAN THE WHOLE LEGAL SIZE PAPER TO BE COPIED, ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A 1/4""BORDER ON THE INSIDE OF THE PAPER. IT WILL GET ONE SIDE OF THE PAPER, BUT NOT THE OTHER SIDE. FOR OUR BUSINESS THIS IS NOT GOOD, WE NEED AN EXACT DUPLICATE. FOR LEGAL SIZE THIS IS NOT THE MACHINE. THIS TEST WAS DONE AT TWO DIFFERENT MACHINES AT OFFICE DEPOT IN TWO DIFFERENT STORES."
1,Do not buy.Its Junk,I bought this thing thinking it was a good deal but the one from the store was broken and never worked.Then they sent me a nother and it jammed all up and I ended up have to send it back with all my inks wiitch they siad the would send me more but I have still have not seen the ink.Then the next one they sent me jamed to but I did get my print head and ink out but still don't have one that works and the sevice over the phone is really bad and rude and now I still have no machen and out 300 bucks becouse they will not refund my money and now I am behind on work in my shop.
5,Great as always!,There new album sounds excellent as their music always does. Even though they are cover tunes Tesla really put their heart into this one.
1,This is NOT a Double CD!!!!,"One more MISLEADING product Advertisement from whoever is in charge of such things! This is NOT a Double-CD set, so it shouldn't be suggested as if it is!There should be a Full Disclosure HONESTY clause when the packing lists ALL the tracks from TWO discs, and yet it only comes with ONE Disc. How is this any different than LYING to your customers about what you are Selling??AMAZON Needs to *Remove* the wording next to this item that tellls the buyer it is a [DOUBLE-CD].There's NO WAY I would have paid $14.99 for this, if I knew it was a Single Disc item :(I only purchased it because it lists ALL of the Tracks for TWO CD's on the back cover.NICE DECEPTION!!!And TESLA, I love you as a band, but what a horrible marketing ploy for those who would seek to buy this at anytime AFTER the Tour that supported this release. Plus for those who couldn't make it to that tours shows......it surely wasn't good for them!"
2,High Hopes,"I was hopeful that this little product would be up to the job but alas, I was wrong. It turns out this is a fragile, underpowered, ineffective tool. Darn."
1,Worst shaver ever,"I used this product about a dozen times and then it just stopped working. I used it normally and didn't drop it, kept it away from water and charged it appropriately. It is a piece of junk and should be avoided at all costs."
4,"great little multi-use shaver, but better for women","I bought this shaver in a local store to handle the job of trimming my beard to a reasonable level on a regular. I wanted battery operated because batteries are easy to find and I always have rechargeables.This little shaver is a little shaver. It might be good to keep a clean-shaved face, but for beard maintenance, especially if you don't shave very often, this thing can cause some pulling and pain.All in all, it's good on batteries, the nose/ear trimmers work well. And without the comb attachment, it does a decent clean-shave without leaving much stubble.If you like your beard though, buy something bigger.If you're a woman, or looking for something for a woman, this is great for bikini shaving and cheaper than theREMINGTON - TRIM & SHAPE BIKINI TRIMMER : BKT-1000 ( Health & Beauty - Shavers & Razors )"
1,Worthless piece or crap,How this can even rate even 1 star befuddles me. This has lousy battery contacts and goes through batteries quickly when it does work. The battery door at the bottom of the device pops off constantly because it breaks. This is a very nice concept/design unfortunately a poor manufacturing process makes it a piece of crap. Too bad.
1,Poorly designed.,Used 2 or 3 times then the head piece that holds the blade in place started popping off even under gentle use. Plastic retaining detents were inadequate and basically just a poor retaining design. It would also jam easily and frequently. I am an engineer and have spent more time than I care to admit taking this piece of dune apart and reassembling. I am so unhappy with this product and given the fact that Remington reviewed this and was willing to put their name on it...I will now steer away from ANY Remington product in the future. They have seriously damaged their reputation with me and my trust in them with this product! Trust is something that is easy to lose and VERY hard to earn back!
2,A Book in Search of a Purpose,"I am torn with this book. I am new to Skeet and Trap and bought this book for help with the finer points of shooting. Well, I got that. So, I guess the book was worth the purchase. However, I found this book to be vague and wandering and almost completely lacking in a destination or purpose. Nothing seems to be where you think it is or where it should be. Very frustrating reading.If you want to know the name and order of every clay / shotgun game there is this is your book. If you are looking for a definitive text on shotgunning methods, there must be something out there better."
3,sport shooter,"Information is ok but nothing great, gives some pointers but if you are an experienced shooter this will probably not help you out at all. More geared to new shooters or those that are having trouble making any hits."
4,A.D.V.'s first dub is still great mature sci-fi fun,"Most write Guy Double Target off as just another mindless hentai, but I strongly disagree. Unlike most hentai, there is an actual story behind it - and a rather interesting sci-fi one at that. The sex (although graphic in some scenes) is anything but gratuitous.I must commend A.D.V.'s English vocal cast on a superb debut performance, especially Rob Mungle (Kunikida from Blue Seed), Tiffany Grant (Asuka from Neon Genesis Evangelion) and Marcy Rae (Radinov from Gunsmith Cats). I must also tip my hat to director Matt Greenfield for his memorable debut performance as the Big Bad Prisoner.It's a pity that no more episodes were produced - the story had a lot of potential in my opinion."
3,Good visual...,"The clock arrived working but the gears never moved, all I can say is that it looks good on the wall but unfortunately the real differentiator (gears working) don't."
5,Can commuter marriages work?,"This is an excellent story showing how a newly wed couple survived a commuter marriage? This is one I would suggest that you add to your MRL (Must Read List). See how they were determined to made it through thick or thin , it surely got thin ."
4,Almost home,"As is the case with other South Beach Diet products, you pay for the system. If you want one less thing to think about as you make war with the Fat Monster, Kraft's South Beach diet may be an ally you'll want to engage.The Oatmeal Chocolate Chip *and* the Peanut Butter cookies are great for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, the kind that South Beach's eat-often-eat-well-eat-little drill sets you up for.I've got some at home and another set in my trusty office stash.The flavor is actually quite nice but it's the nutritional facts on the ground that'll sell you on this chunk of a system that sets you up to make your decisions *before* the munchies strike and then deal with them on that basis."
2,NOT PROVEN TO WORK IN A REAL SITUATION,"THE TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN HOW TO ESCAPE A MANS GRIP,TO ME SEAM LIKE THEY MIGHT HELP YOU TO ESCAPE,BUT WHEN YOUR NOT EXPECTING SOMEONE TO GRAB YOU OR YOUR VERY SCARED OUT IN THE STREET IT WOULD SEEM TO ME LIKE IT WOULD BE KINDA HARD TO REMEMBER THOSE STEPS.PLUS THE MAN COULD PULL OUT A GUN OR NIFE TO MAKE THE SITUATION MORE DIFFICULT,AND THIS DVD DOES'NT TEACH YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.PLUS THE PUNCHES AND KICKS TAUGHT,ARE BLOWS TAKING PLACE WITH THE INSTRUCTOR NOT MOVING.THIS DVD SHOULD SHOUW HOW TO EXECUTE THESE BLOWS WILE THE MAN IS IN MOTION TRYING TO GRAB OR FIGHT YOU AROUND THESE KICKS AND PUNCHES,AND PLUS HOW TO MANUEVER AND DO A MORE DIFFRENT BLOW IN CASE THE OTHER TECNIQUES DID'NT WORK.THE ONLY THINGS ON THIS DVD THAT COULD POSSIBLY GET A MAN OFF OFF YOU (WITH MORE ACURATE FIGHTING SKILLS FOR WOMEN) IS THE WORKOUT SECTION AT THE END,THAT WOULD POWER UP YOUR MUSCLES TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GET HIM OFF OF YOU AT LEAST.THIS DVD IS NOT PROVEN TO WORK."
3,Some tips and a few basic uncontextualized self defense techniques for male or female adults,"The title is misleading. It shouldn't be called ""Total Self Defense Technique for Women"" but ""Some tips and a few basic uncontextualized self defense techniques for male or female adults"". Master Lee seems to know his business, but the regular woman in the streets is not a highly trained martial artist and might not be in great shape as his assistant is. By the way, that was the most interesting part about the DVD, the girl who performs as an assistant is beautiful and has a gorgeous and extremely fit body."
5,Twist of the Wrist,"This book is a great learning tool for a new, intermediate or veteran rider to learn from. It is full of useful info on cornering, braking, proper throttle control and breaking through the fear of pushing your limits and over all be a safer rider. Great book. Ride safe."
2,Not as bad as the second book in the series,"Back when this book came out I thought it was great. Since then there have been many writers who have SKILL WRITING as well as riding/racing which makes this book not worth it. Don't waste your money on this book, buy a Moto-skills book by Nick Ienatsch, Lee Parks, David Hough, or even the MSF Guide to Motorcycle Excellence over this book any day. Only if you have all the others would I advise getting this one. Even then, it's only as a curiosity or to laugh at how bad it is written.Code is an excellent rider and former racer, and his class is pretty decent. His teaching style and knowledge are well-grounded (if a little bit tainted by Scientology Voodoo). But this book is starting to really show its age, and Code made his career racing and later teaching hands-on. As a writer he is ""not so good."""
3,For Novice and Intermediate Racers,"This race-oriented book focuses on providing a methodology to analyse any racetrack allowing you to select and ride the lines that best suit you and your bike. Very little here for streetriders ... Flick of the Wrist II has much more on actual riding technique. If you're new to racing, buy it. If you don't plan on racing, don't buy it unless you're curious about racing strategies."
3,"Good basic racetrack stuff, but a bit too ""Cosmic"" in areas","The book does a decent job of introducing the starting racetrack pilot to the basic concepts of corner types, throttle application, etc. Despite the fact that these topics are addressed, I felt there was a bit too much offbeat ""Dianetics"" style mentality references, and not enough specific ""nuts and bolts"" instruction on HOW to do the actual act of riding the motorcycle. Having read the Vol.I and II, I think a new racer would be best off saving their money on this book, and getting only the Vol. II version. This book is targeted primarily at the racetrack environment, and I've found that the book ""Sportbiking: The Real World: The Advanced Riders Handbook"", is better suited for true street going sportbikers."
3,OK but Twist II is much better,"This book is OK, but focuses almost entirely on road racing. The sequel ""Twist of the wrist 2"" is a much better book for most readers. Twist 2 is the standard and often-cited work in the field. It's a better book in every way, and is very good for advanced street riders as well as for racers."
4,helpful,"This book doesn't have anything groundbreaking and is a little dated as of 2007 but is a very helpful reminder of the important things that you learned and forget to apply when you are actually riding. Not at all technical. The sidebars don't really tie into the content very well, but overall, it has helped me improve my track days."
4,A need to read before reading Twist of the Wrist II,This is a fantastic read for anyone who is new and experienced in biking. knowing the effect on suspention of various actions you perform on the bike is of incredible value.I was blown away and thought it is the best technical book i had read on bikes(until I read the sequel)... should get both - the second elaborates on the first!!
5,the bible of high-performance motrocycle riding,"i read this book when i was just street riding, and the more i rode the more i learned and the more i re-read the book. when i started roadracing, i bought the second version and it took my riding and racing to new heights.if you ride a motorcycle, you should read this book, period."
2,A real mixed bag,"I was overall very disappointed with this book, allowing for some of the content to be for racers only I was surprised at seeing content most motorcyclists would be aware of from monthly bike magazines, i.e. counter steering, braking techniques etc. Keith Code is a very knowledgable man on this subject but his writing style is really dreadful, his use of BOLD text and regular underlining gets to be really annoying.I've now completed the book and as an average sports bike rider have learned absolutely nothing new. It may appeal to you but my advice would be to borrow a copy and read a few chapters before purchasing."
2,Too avant guard for me,"Too avant guard for me - maybe I'll warm up to it in time. I was looking for something at least as melodic as Amad Jamal. I have heard some works by Giuseppe Logan that are much more melodic. I thought that this work would be like that. On the other hand, as I understand it, Logan has been clearly a pioneer in particularly his earlier works - which means there is learning here to be had. Logan himself is a delightful personality and a very good musician."
3,Fairly complete,A nice compliation from various authors about Colonial Boston furniture. Contains a good chapter on bombe pieces; from bowls to chests on chests. First printed in 1974 by the Colonial Society of Mass.
1,should have stayed lost,"once again,transfering a poor 3rd generation vhs to dvd IS not,REPEAT is NOT REMASTERED and should not be alowed to use that claim unless you can prove you remastered them. some were so poor we couldn't watch them. very poor set!!!!!"
5,Wonderful story,"An amazing story of courage and God‘s hand in people‘s lives. I highly reccomend this short, ànd inspiring book. My children ages 5 and 6 were engrossed in it, as well."
5,Fear the way it should be done...,"This is one clever horror novel, with all the twists and turns you'd ever want, characters you care about, and a feeling of fear that runs from page one all the way to the end. And speaking of the end, you definitely won't guess what's about to happen until you breathlessly reach those last pages!"
2,Voodoo is not a craft but a religion,"Why do people treat Voodoo like it is a craft? It isn't Wicca or Witchcraft; where one buys a book and can be practicing in 1 week. Voodoo is a religion like the Jewish or Catholic faiths. No one can read a book on Catholics or Jews and think that they are now converted! These conversion can take years. Voodoo books go wrong by trying to outline Voodoo like Wicca. Voodoo can take decades to understand before your ready to practice. I have been raised around Voodoo from a young age and even I am still trying to get to a point where I have everything down pack and can safely call on Loas and perform spell work. Treating Voodoo like an occult craft is very dangerous. Voodoo deals alor with sprits and possesions-and toying around with Voodoo is a sure fire way to mafe very bad things happen in your life, if you do not have the proper knowledge and preperations."
2,Better to just do some internet research,"I risk angering Baron Samedi, but really not a great book. More of a folk history than an informative book. I'd channel Marie Laveau before paying out for this one."
4,VOODOO & HOODOO,This is a good book well written to the point that when you start reading you want to continue because it capture you from the beginning.
4,Interesting Book,"This book was at least very interesting. I enjoy reading about places that are not frequented too often by anglers or other people. I have already planned a few hikes centered around some of the places he describes and mentions in the book. I feel that he does not go into great detail about locations. At times I was confused at exactly what location he was describing. There are a few chapters that I found completely irrelevant like the one on photographing fish. Overall, however, I enjoyed reading this book and it is one I will keep in my library."
3,Seemed fragmented,"I guess I'm used to following a plot, this was more of a documentary, and seemed to jump around in the story"
5,1/18 M4 Sherman tank.,"I am very impressed by the detail and painting. This tank has great detailed add ons, like 5 gal. containers, helmets extra track pieces. The only bad thing about this model is that it throws of it tracks very easily if not rolled in a straight line."
5,Wow! a tank with moving treads!,"This tank is simply the finest non-model rendering I have ever seen. The paint job is nearly perfect, hatches open, and even tools line this impressive machine. I only have two problems with it. First, the tank driver is short and nearly impossible to remove initially. I resorted to cutting him free. Secondly, I really would have liked instructions listing what moves, how certain things work, etc. Overall though, this is the best tank I have seen, especially for the price. P.S. The driver has a pistol strapped to the base of the tank."
4,Nice historical display piece,"This is a basically accurate 1:18 version of a common version of the ""Sherman"" tank to see combat in WW2. Despite being advertised as a toy item, it will be at home on a display shelf of WW2 memorabilia or with your history books. With moderate modelling skilll this ""toy"" can be transformed into a good model."
4,Packaging That Works,"After having eaten about six of the twelve packages, I must comment on the packaging. It works and works well. So much of today's new packaging, especially for small or single servings, is unweildy and often results in more mess than it is worth - especially the silly bowls with ring top openers. These pouches are great.The rice is good. Of course, it is not the quality of home cooked but it is well cooked and slips out of the pouch with no mess. Not bad for quick preparation."
1,Typical Grt Hits Package,"I've been waiting years for a Rembrandts GH CD and what do they do? Pull the same stunt that record companies do with most GH collections - leave out the best song. Where is ""Chase the Clouds Away?"" I'm giving this 1 star because there isn't a lower rating."
4,He Got the Led Out.,"He was big. He was intimidating. He was a godsend to an industry dominated by the promoters and not the artists who were grossly expoited by them. Peter Grant was to Led Zep what a great driver is to a race car: the difference between winning or hitting the wall in turn four. Good management is essential for any artistic endeavor; otherwise it spins out of control under the weight of the artists' emotional involvement. Peter Grant allowed the musicians to make musical decisions without his interference while he tended to the important matters of the bottom line. He bullied and cajoled, but the objects of his abuse were overdue...But his hubris came with a price: his own comeuppence at the hands of Bill Graham's organization.Not a particularly well-written piece, but well worth the look behind the tawdry curtain of a fledgling music industry. One does not have to be a diehard Zep fan to enjoy this, as I am not but did enjoy it immensely."
4,The Gee man,"A must for any Zeppelin fan, there is no doubt he loved the band, and is one of the reasons they became what the did."
1,POOR TASTE,Someone who can't even spell properly in their own review - should not have the opportunity to write such a contrived view of the Bible's prophesies of the End Times and try to MAKE them fit the Greatest President of the Last Century. Shame on you!
3,Canon S500 has advantages but also flaws,"I use a MacIntosh G3 ""Wall Street"" powerbook, which is too old to support USB. I had to buy a USB plugin card that fits in my PCI slot, to get the printer hooked up. Unanticipated extra expense.Print quality is excellent. Print speed is good, but not as good as advertised.The printer has hung twice in the last two months. To get it working again, I had to reboot the printer, reboot the MacIntosh, and re-select the printer from the Chooser. It was an inconvenience for me, but a work-stopper for another member of my household.If I were making this purchase decision again, I would still buy this printer."
2,Not DOS compatible!,"I bought the Cannon S500 to replace a 15 year old HP Lasejet II, and to add color capability. The color is nice but the printer is no replacement for the Lasejet! I was unable to print anything from any of my old DOS programs and even a simple ""COPY XXX.TXT PRN"" command did not work.I complained to Canon and they wrote back ""Unfortunately the S500 is not compatible with MS-DOS applications. I apologize for any inconvenioence this may cause. We look forward to assisting you in the future.""I thought all non-postscript printers had HP PCL compatibility but the current Canon line does not. The PC Mag review of the S500 did not alert me to this limitation and none of the Canon ... S500 advertising mentioned it either.Am I the only PC using dinosaur who still depends on DOS capabilities?"
2,not impressed,This was not a very good fireplace video.I was very unhappy with it.It is just a picture of a fireplace from a distance.I was expecting the fullscreen version which makes you TV the fireplace.I think they should have put that on the box so you know.
3,"Ok, but but not the best I have seen......","I recieved this for a Christmas gift. It's okay, but I am searching for a better one. I think this one is cheesy compared to other ones I have seen. (There is a reason it was at a well known dollar retail place) It is so dark, you can ONLY see the bottom part of the bricks and not ALL of the bricks in the fire box like others. So,it doesn't feel that realistic. The popping is okay, but it isn't that realistic. It does make you relax though, and if your not that picky, it might work for you. It's okay, but I wouldn't pay $12.00 for this one."
4,Tumultous Times,A good introduction to a Time of Troubles for the Romanovs that laid the groundwork for the coming tide of populism.
4,married with children dvd review,I love this show I use to watch it when i was younger. The show is still funny.
5,Season 10,I also look forward to seeing the eleventh and final season come out. I had recorded almost every show off the air on VHS. However I missed one or two from each season and what I have is full of pops and fizzles. Having a nice clean recording of each season will be good. One of the nice things about DVD is when you see a familiar actor and check out the guest actors in the credits and see the name of someone who now stars in another show or movie.
2,Bad discs!,"The show is excellent, too bad the discs you receive in this season (and all season starting with 7) look like crap as soon as you get them. I believe it's either shoddy workmanship on the discs or the cheap packaging Sony went to after season 6. I have bought season 10 2 times and both times only disc 3 looked new. Don't waste your money like I did."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny.","LMAO at this very funny guy. Hard to pick a single bit, but was ROFL over the vegetarian bit, and splitting a gut at the Viagra bit."
4,Little-Noted Relationship Revisited,"Peter Levy provides a useful reminder of the relationships between the New Left and the American labor movement during the 1960s as a contribution to the University of Illinois Press's The Working Class in American History series. Levy justifiably employs broad working definitions to the concepts of New Left, labor, and social activist unions in examining the activities of the component groups within his focus. Unions and new leftists met frequently at the flash points of civil rights, anti-war, and other fronts of the 1960s, but ongoing relationships involving the United Electrical Workers, the UAW and various new left organizations also characterized the period, as Levy demonstrates. The drive for participatory democracy had many friends, as Levy's superbly documented account testifies."
2,12 Volt connection cord overheats.,"During the first year Igloo replaced my 12 volt cord twice due to meltdown. The cord gets very hot after a few hours of travel. After a few months the plastic around the fuse eventually deteriorates to the point you can smell it. The cord becomes unusable. After the one year warranty they refused to replace the third cord blaming a possible voltage problem with my Pontiac Torrent. I measure the voltage to be app. 12.6 Volts. Well below their maximum rated operating voltage of 14 Volts. It may be a cord problem or, more likely, the unit is possibly drawing to much power. To add insult to injury, and contrary to what their web site states ""the Igloo Online Store carries the full line of replacement parts to keep your favorite cooler in top condition for years to come"", they no longer carry replacement cords and I was reffered to a third party supplier."
3,"A couple of aluminum bars, pretty basic","It's a couple of aluminum bars that were poorly welded together. Due to the simplicity of the product itself, I was expecting a little more quality. I mounted a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus to this board, as they market it specifically for that power supply. The screws were horribly cheap and I snapped the screw heads off of all 4 screws while putting them in. I wasn't turning them very hard. It was amazing to me. You do need to drill your own holes to mount the power supply.As for the pedalboard itself, it's like I said. There's not much that goes into making these things, so I'm not sure how the welds and screws were overlooked.The size was perfect for me as I only have 6 pedals and live in a tiny apartment. If you have ample room in your living quarters/practice space, just build one yourself.I will say that the carrying case and velcro were great. It's good for a basic pedalboard, which was all I needed."
4,solid pro gear- assembly tricky,"This thing is exactly what they said; a very solid base for your pedals with the great Velcro. The wires tuck neatly underneath the slats.Good design.Installing a the voodoo-lab power supply on the little rack involves drilling holes in the aluminum. There are no marks or guidelines so you have to be pretty handy. Mine came out slightly crooked but still worked, but you pretty much only get one shot at getting it right. Would advise people go to eBay with the pre-assembled one unless you are pretty handy.The junior will hold about 10 pedals of average size which is just the number that the power supply will accommodate."
5,Match made in heaven,"I got this in 2011 b/c I was spending so much time setting up at gigs messing around with cables, loops, batteries, and pedals. I use this for my small gig pedals powered by the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power ISO-5 that fits perfectly underneath. This Pedaltrain is very well built and its super strong you could practically jump on it and you won't destroy it. I brings double sided sticky velcro to set your pedals in place. The pedal board is light weight and the case is very rugged with good handels and shoulder strap. Combine this with a pedal power supply and a pedal snake and you have a match made in heaven; no more wasting time setting up."
1,Pulls my hair out,"I bought this haircut kit because of all the rave reviews, and the integrated vacuum. The latter works ok, even though the occasional hair goes through the screen and gets stuck. The biggest problem was that it doesnt cut well and actually pulls my hair out. My friend had bought one as well, and has the same problem."
4,product pulls when goig against the grain,"I bought the product to keep my hair at the shortest lenght possible . Product does what it's designed to do, but pulls when going against the grain. Possibly dull blades or slow speed in cutting."
4,Night and day difference....,"This product is great. The clean up is nothing compared to when cutting with regular clippers. Almost all the hair is sucked up by the vacuum and cleaning is reduced to wiping down the sink area. The motor could be a bit stronger, but it still cuts the hair without any pulling."
4,simple and mostly clean,"We bought this about two months ago and have used it two maybe three times. It works great as long as my husband's hair is clean (his hair is thick and if it is a little greasy it is hard to cut.) Occasionally I see little hairs on his shirt while I am cutting. It isn't very loud, and that surprises me since we used Wahl hair clippers previous to this and they were loud! We like it and for the cost of it, it sure is better and cheaper than him going to the barber!"
3,Vacuum needs improvement.,"The clippers cut great and they are also very light weight. However, if you are cutting short hair (i.e. buzz cuts), then the vacuum will only pick up about 60-80% of the hair clippings. Produces significantly less mess, but not mess-free."
5,Excellent for kids/adults with special needs!,"My teenage son has Down Syndrome and could not stand to get his haircut no matter what we tried (movies in front of him, treats promised afterward, etc.). One kind stylist suggested I give him buzz cuts at home and told me how easy that was if he'd sit for it. I bought a medium priced hair clipper and tried a buzz cut at home. I found out what he hated as much as anything was 1. the noise of the clipper 2. the clippings on his neck. The Remington clipper/vacuum solved both of his issues. I have recommended this to other parents of kids with special needs and they agree it is perfect for keeping kids happy. THANK YOU Remington!!"
1,Turns into an epilator after a year,"After one year of use the blades are now so dull that they tear my hair out rather than cut. The blades, advertised as never needing to be oiled, might not in fact need oil. Rather, they need to be completely replaced. Also, as another reviewer pointed out the vacuum doesn't quite work as well as they'd lead you to believe. I was quite pleased with this product the up until the blades crapped out on me. I'd be interested to see the results of a year-later follow up review. Products simply should not be manufactured to last a year then fail. I feel like I leased these clippers..."
4,"Good, but still messy.","I purchased this a few years ago, it does a good job, but still leaves a considerable mess. The blade seems to not be cutting as well either, and I have to use scissors to clean up the hairs it misses."
4,Good product by $99 is very very expensive,"This product is good but my son didn't like due to air it throughs out because of it vaccume capability in cold seasons.I used for about 2 years without any problem with normal usage (Once in 2 months). Beware of pricing, I bought this product 2 years back about $30 to 35 and now online (with some seller) it is casting $99.00, definitely it doesn't $100.00. Beware buyers!!!I can give more stars to this per my usage, but it is not as strong as other products."
3,Quality is OK!,The design is good but the product life is about 6-7 Months that is it. Well for the price you pay it is good.
5,Good machine,There's only one bad thing about this product: it comes with no 1mm plastic guide. The rest is very good
2,Easy clean up but not for anyone but kids,We have had one of these in our house since my son was born and he is 5. It is awesome to cut his hair and it all goes into the vacuum and is easy to dump.. very easy clean up. The cutting of the blades sometimes leaves streaky marks on his head but he thinks it is cool. Sometimes it pulls his hair when it is too long instead of cutting it. We use it only to cut his hair and if you want your kid to have anything but a buzz cut I wouldn't purchase. For us it works because he likes it like the cutter cuts :).
5,Perfect for simple cuts,"I just received this today and used it for my first self-cut. Works great! I just do a buzz cut, so I don't need anything fancy. It has the feel of a low-end model because it's made of light plastic, but the vacuum portion works better than I had expected. I'd guess the vacuum would have a harder time with longer hair, though. It's rather loud since it's running two separate motors. But for the price, I'm very happy with it. After two cuts, it'll have paid for itself!"
4,Nice vacuum hair clipper,"The unit is a little larger than I'm used to using, but I will get used to it. Love the vacuum idea and it works good, only a few stray hairs were missed. Did a great job cutting hair. Great vacuum clipper for the price."
4,Cleaning after a haircut is never a big issue anymore,"A good idea to have a vacuum equipped hair clipper, it saves much time to clean after a home haircut, but you should know that it doesn't really vacuum everything, you'll still have to clean around 10% of the hair that it didn't catch, but still, the mess is so much smaller that what I used to do before!!The other thing is doesn't look and feel as a heavy duty machine, the clipper blades are smaller than a usual hair clippers, sometimes you'll need to run many times on the same spot to get the job well done"
3,"Great product, but not a long shelf life","I first bought this product in a department store in 2006. My husband loved it because there is little to no mess afterwards. We use the vacuum trimmer on my husband and my son about twice a month. After only one year, the product died. I am not sure what the problem was, and despite its short shelf life, I bought it again because it is lightweight and has little to no clean up after trimming. I recommend this product. For the price, it would not matter if I had to buy one every year, it is great."
4,Shaver shaves!,"This shaver works very well, cuts rapidly and evenly, needs no oiling as some others do, cleans easily, and retains the hair in the vacuum receptacle which is easy to empty. The only drawback I have with it, and would have appreciated knowing up front, is that the deepest guide is only one inch, so if you want something longer - oh well. Also, if you want to return it - it will end up costing you nearly as much as the kit (no postage refund, you have to pay shipping back and 25% restock fee) so it's not worth it."
4,Great Idea & Design - But Somewhat Fragile,The on-board vacuum works great and saves me having to get our upright out to clean up. The only thing that I wish were different was that it was made better. The unit is all plastic and won't endure a drop on a hard floor very well so be careful.
4,Remington HKVAC-2000,"This product is great, easy in use, quiet and light. I recommend from the bottom of my heart."
2,Key feature leaves you down,"The Remington works fine as a trimmer; however, the vacuum feature leaves a lot to be desired. The vacuum was the primary reason I was willing to change from my current cordless trimmer, and it does not do an adequate job.As stated by another reviewer, the trimmer relies too much on gravity to capture the hair in its vacuum. Too high a percentage of hairs simply get blown away by the exhaust. There may be fewer hairs to clean up, but they're scattered over a wider area. Cleanup time was not reduced nearly enough to justify the addition of a cord."
1,"Garbage kiddie toy, do not buy","This looked like a good idea but...Every clipper I'd seen before use AC power, not low voltage DC power. Result motors are not very powerful. Next on first use some hair managed to get into the vacuum motor compartment and promptly got wound up in the motor, jamming it. Worse there is no way to disassemble it even partially to clean out hair that WILL get inside so it's lifespan is very questionable.Lesson learned. You don't need special clippers or trimmers to cut your own hard, all you need is a quality set of clippers with a set of cutting combs for various desired lengths of hair.Do yourself a favor and buy some real clippers, not this kiddie toy junk."
4,Seemed really good but started pulling hair vs cutting it,"I've actually purchased two of these over the years. Had one for at least a couple years and it was wonderful. But I noticed that it started pulling my kids' hair now and then which, naturally, would upset them. And when they don't enjoy getting their haircut much in the first place, this is annoying. So I thought it was because it was old, so I bought a new one. And right away it was doing the same thing. So then I thought it was because I was going too fast. But it still will give a quick grab and pull on the hair now and then. I don't really know why this is, but it's the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. It's worth buying, but only because it's the only hair trimmer with vacuum built into it on the market."
5,Works great for husband's hair cut,"We were skeptical that this haircut kit could replace trips to the barber. My husband is partially bald and knew just how to advise me on what attachment to use on each section of his head. I'm not skilled enough yet to go solo, but his haircuts have come out looking really good and the vacuum has worked flawlessly so far. We are very pleased that in just 3 months of using it instead of going to the barber we saved more than the cost of the kit!"
2,Threw it away while it was still working,Makes more noise than it actually sucksHair still goes all over the floor
1,Cheap Junk!,"Was not happy with this at all. Threw it away and purchased an Oster after about a week. Cheaply-made, awkward, and only sucked up about 50% of the hair that it cut AT MOST. When no attachments were used, the blades were not adjustable and nicked my skin a lot. Maybe it works better for long hair, I don't know, but this does not work at all on hair under half an inch long, including facial hair. Basically, it was just a piece of junk. Surprised at the good reviews it has receieved!"
4,Vacuum Haircut kit,"The clippers work well. The big selling point is that it does not need oil. The vacuum does not work too well, but still catches some hair. Unfortunately, I think if the clippers did not have the vacuum, it would be a quieter set of clippers. It would be better if the vacuum actually picked up more hair.Also the rest of the kit came with a cheap pouch to store the clippers and attachments in. It would be better if the storage provided was a plastic container instead of a cheap pouch.d"
3,"Good product, but not a long shelf life","The vacuum works nice - catches the cut hair and it is easy to empty the collection space. Cuts hair as advertised, and has the usual snap on attachments. Lasted a year, then quit with no warning. $22 + shipping."
4,good clippers for kids,these are great clippers for children because it takes most of the fallen hair. that was a big issue for my child... thanks
4,Good and Bad -Quality Control Issue,"I purchased one of these for our master bedroom and liked it so much I bought one for another bed. The second one was disappointing, all the fill bunched up and made a lump in the middle. If the second one had arrived first I would not have ordered a second one. The price was so reasonable I didn't bother to complain to Amazon."
3,bad baffling is baffling,"I do not understand the 4 rows of baffling. If it were box baffled it would be so much better. What happens is it's four strips of padding that go from side to side on the bed - one of the seams sits exactly where my hips are, all the way across the bed. So basically it dips down and the stuffing moves up away from the seam on one side and down on the other - so you have a huge dip in the bed. Otherwise the paddig is very comfortable and I don't feel the other seams...it's a shame, because it's very comfortable other than for the big dip with no stuffing in it."
2,"thick, but dissapointed","I received it in a huge box and the first inpression is very thick. But there is a problem, the filler in it isn't smooth and flat. I put on my mattress, looks like small hills, up and down. It is soft, but if there are more sticher to confines those fillers (there only 4 big box stichers), it would be much better. I want to return it, but think about how much shipping fee I need to pay for that huge package, I leave it and hope oneday, my future dog would like it."
1,This is a lumpy bumpy waste of money.,"We bought this king size fiberbed for our motorhome bed. My husband and I tried it for one night and had to take it off. We both woke up with backaches. It would be fine except the bed is divided into 4 sections, so there are 4 areas in the bed where it is sewn down that there is absolutly no fiberfill, and other areas where it is about 4 inches thick. It is like sleeping on stairs. Save your money for something else. This one is getting returned."
2,DONT ORDER,I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS THING!!! IT ALL BUNCHES UP IN PLACES AND NOTHING UNDER MY HIP. IT HAS TO BE CONSTANTLY FLUFFED UP AND IT ALL ENDS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BED BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND I.
1,imagin driving on a hwy full of bumpers,I do not think any human being can fall asleep on this trash. Actually i can not even lie on this for more than 1 minute and I feel low back pain.it has good material but poor design.
5,Fiber Bed,"I have never had a better night sleep!! This fiber bed is amazing, we are completley in love with it!"
3,I'm on the fence...,"I can't decide if this is a good product or not. While it feels good to sleep on, it certainly doesn't look good on the bed, it's very lumpy and uneven. We only paid $19.99 for it so I didn't expect a miracle. I would recommend it for someone that has a firm mattress and prefers a pillow top."
1,"NO, NO!!","I hated this product. I thought it looked so comfortable, it wasn't. I think a lot of it is the filling. Amazon ships it stuffed ina a little box, and when you pull it out it is clumpy. It a year, that never went away. We tries turning it, beating the stuffing flat, haveing it professionally cleaned and fuffed. Nothing made it right. We threw it away and went with something more foamy."
2,"A good price, but not a great bed topper","I got mine for $19.99 so I was't expecting much. The part that has padding is fine, but the filling is done in 4 sections and one of them has no filling at all. If I lay in cetain positions it's fine, but sometimes it's really unfortable to lay on if in a differnt position. Also getting it to stay in position on the bed is difficult. We usually have to fix it once a week, to get it centered on the bed."
2,"Not pillow top, not featherbed, not pad, not sure what it is","I bought this thinking it was a cross between a featherbed and one of those space-age memory foam mattress pads. It wasn't really either, but combined the worst aspects of both. First, as other reviewers have noted, it does not hold its form past a few days. But this is useful in some sense, because its initial ""form"" is uncomfortable. Imagine four long body pillows stitched together. Try it lengthwise and you slip into one of the stitching cavities. Try it crosswise and its like sleeping on four pillows perpendicular to your body.My wife likes it so it got 2 stars, but I can't stand it. Also, make sure you have very deep mattress fitted sheets; when you first put this thing on the bed it's monstrously puffy."
2,Price doubled over night & bunched up baffles,"I just got one of these in today and all the baffles were fluffy on one side and flat on the other. I had to work for an hour trying to push them even. I came back to see if anyone else had reported this problem with the baffles and was shocked to see the price also doubled over night. Once you get this on your bed forget having a nice looking made bed because it's so lumpy it looks like you have a body hidden under the covers! It might have been worth the $19, but I sure wouldn't give $39 for it.*Update* I slept on it last night and what little sleep I did get was spent tossing and turning. I felt like I was standing on my head because my bed now seems to slope."
5,That GIRL can sing!,"I love ""That Boy Can Sing."" Just bought copies to give to friends - really cool."
5,I love this CD,"I Want to Love You is my favorite CD that Kassie has released. It is full of songs written by some great Nashville songwriters and then performed by an incredible singer. Kassie also wrote 2 of this songs on the album. I have so many favorites on this album, but Sneakers in the Dryer is now my favorite because I thought it would be horrible just by the title. I was SO SO wrong and just love it. Buy the album..it's worth it!!!"
3,I want to Love you,"I chose this rating because though the CD is okay to listen to, it does not knock it out of the ballfield for me."
5,My Travel Bible,"I have just ordered Italia 2006. It must be the 10th edition of this wonderful travel guide that I have bought. I wouldn't leave home without it.Yes, it is written in simple to understand Italian. After all you are going to visit Italy...they speak Italian not English!It is one of the few travel guides that tell you the closing days of the restaurants.I cannot think of one thing wrong with the Michelin Guide and I have been using them for 30 years!"
3,"Lodging, the confusing way","While the idea of the red book is great, I found it difficult to read and even harder to translate all the various symbols. Somehow the legend misses a lot when it comes to actually understanding the listings. I bought it to take with us on our trip, and after attempting to review the book multiple times, I doubt we will."
5,"Revealing, Practical and Poetic","As a collector of guide books about Iberia, I found this volume exceptionally revealing, practical and poetic."
2,Tedious,The book is very detailed and tedious. Not for someone is isn't serious and just exploring the possibility. This is precise and detailed and intended for someone who has decided to go there.
3,Interesting information,A good book for history and vague information. Not the one to carry on the journey. Nice addition to my collection.
3,Enjoyable but not groundbreaking,"Detectives Mars Bahr and Nettie Fritsch are working the Cold Case Unit in the Minneapolis Police Department. Their assignment is to investigate the sixteen-year old disappearance of convenience store clerk, Andrea Bergstad. She disappeared without a trace while talking on the phone with a friend. Powerful people do not want Mars to succeed at this investigation, but he keeps digging and at the end of it all, he ends up putting people he cares about at risk.ALONE AT NIGHT is the fourth book in the Mars Bahr series. Mars evolves more with each story which are as good as character studies as they are mysteries. As for this one, I enjoyed it even though I knew who the culprit was so soon as a certain political party affiliation was mentioned. Authors should get more creative because I find it very annoying to guess the ending during the fist quarter of the book. It is much more thrilling to be proven wrong."
1,Questionable at best,"Speaking as one intrigued by the Oxfordian theory, I admit that this book was not only suspect in much of its reasoning, but it was also woefully disorganized. Various timelines are scattered throughout the book, and by the end I could not understand how the information was supposed to be organized.Even further, claims were made--or suppositions were brought up--and then such presumptions were deemed ""fact"" when they were really not proven. I am fine with speculation, but when asked to accept the previous chapter's speculation as ""true,"" I simply couldn't make that leap of faith. I was surprised at the decidedly non-academic and researched tone the book took.Still, it was interesting."
2,Who Were Shake-speare?,"Disappointing. Mr. Allen starts by positing a collaboration between the man from Stratford and Edward, the 17th Earl of Oxford. By the end of the book, it's no longer a possibility but definite -- and without supporting evidence. Frankly, I can't imagine a more unlikely collaboration. I think the author is influenced by the thought that ""Shakespeare"" is a group effort, possibly headed by Edward Oxford. He struggles with it, as all of us interested in the controversy do. But as far as I can see, his case is unproven."
3,A good guide!,"A good guide for medical students, residents and fellows. For practicing medical psychiatrists, this guide should serve as a good resource for quick review, say in an emergency situations, since it covers most topics. However, this guide lacks the breadth that experts will need to know more clinical details (e.g. no details on medical and neurologic conditions that most C-L psychiatrists encounter) or to review for the ABPN psyhosomatic exam."
5,Good workout and fun video.,"I like this video very much and use it often. The music is fine, it's a demanding but not terribly difficult workout, and the instructor and routine are fun. The instructor is a little on the perky side but that makes up for my unperkiness when facing a 45 minute workout. Also it's nice to see women on the tape who have healthy figures - not model-skinny. I recommend this one highly."
5,great over-all workout,I have used this video consistently over 1 year and find that it continues to be a good fat-burning workout because she concentrates on the big muscles of the lower legs. Easy to learn the steps in just a few viewings. I consider this a safe video--low chance for injury. Gets you going.
2,Don't blink,"I bought this video to help me lower my high blood pressure... think it raised it! I found the video very hard to follow. In the middle of a routine, the instuctor shouts CHANGE for a 1 step variation that threw me totally off for a significant chunk of the routine. I ended up making up my own routine to go with the music. Think I'll stick with Margaret Richards & Jane Fonda."
4,Fun & Catchy Action Songs,"This CD contains a good selection of fun and catchy songs geared towards children. Even I enjoyed listening to them. The songs are repetitive enough for preschoolers to learn. Lyrics are included but it is a pity there are no suggestions for actions. The voices of the children are perfectly in tune, sweet and clear especially those soloists. The melodies are in a range comfortable for both children's and adult's voices. Accompaniment is nicely done with quite a number of creative variations. A good buy."
2,"basic, kind of blah","This book offers dozens of cross stitch charts, but none of them are that great. There are a few Pennsylvania Dutch patterns that are interesting, but most of the patterns are rudimentary. There are 8 pages of the book in color; the rest are black and white. Some of the patterns include a pattern of George Washington's face, Uncle Sam's face, and Abe Lincoln's face."
2,Not the correct size,"I bought it because I thought it used 3"" x 5"" refills, but the actual size is 3""x5"" so the paper refill it is 2 1/4""x3 1/2"" and that's not what i wanted, I kept it but i don't even know if I am going to find a refill for it. It was also too expensive."
3,the best non-video that I never bought,I always choose 'no item video - do not buy' when I'm in the mood to not buy and/or watch a video.
3,Minimalism at it's finest.,The bleak nothingness of this video will provide endless hours of entertainment to even the most jaded nihilist.
2,Not True Digital - Plenty of Hiss - Not for Audiophiles,"Don't be fooled by the product name. I'm not sure where the ""digital"" comes in on these headphones. Perhaps in the SRS component? These headphones do not provide the quality of digital transmission.The 900MHz RF transmission is definitely analog and that is immediately apparent. You can hear hissing, the audio gets fainter as you get further away, and interference causes the normal analog artifacts. Do not plan to get the crystal clear audio you'd expect from digital transmission.If you plan to watch analog TV or listen to AM/FM radio and sit in the same room as the transmitter, then I guess these headphones are okay. But if you expect CD quality audio or plan to listen from another room, then these will be sure to disappoint."
1,No clear signal - had to return!,"It's a great design concept, but after a few days, the electronics in my office seemed to get the better of this product. I could only get noise and hiss. No matter how many times I ""tuned"" the headphones to the base unit, I could no longer pull in the audio signal from my CD player. I wound up returning it to SI, requesting a replacement. They sent me a check instead. Now I'm shopping around. Very unhappy with Sharper Image.P.S.--Bought a very affordable pair from Radio Shack and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality!"
1,Don't fit a B-square Mount,These do not fit the b-square Marlin 336 rifle mount sold here on Amazon. Don't buy them.
4,missing pieces,Interesting reading about child abuse. Would of rated it 5-star but I felt it should of added more information about the main characters in the story.
2,Made in China,"Amazon's description says Made in USA, and they may still have some older ones in stock, but I'm not risking having to return it. I went to the store to buy this tenderizer, and Jaccard has moved it's factory to China. I'm going to order Deni Meat Tenderizer instead. Deni's factory is in Italy. I'm sad I'm not able to help the American factory worker, but at least I'm almost sure it is not made in a sweatshop, and by buying the Deni brand I'm slightly punishing Jaccard for laying off their American factory workers."
1,Does not work well at all,"I got this for my husband and it is so big and bulky it was really difficult to maneuver to the water. The compartment where the batteries are stored leaks so it worked for a total of 4 minutes. A real mess. We took the motors off and since the housing is ruined by water, we use only the float. The only way to get it fixed is to box it up and send it back which would have cost a bundle. No thanks."
2,defective inflatable motorized pool lounge,"Naturally, this product was made in China. It came to me with both electrical rod connectors rusted on both ends, thereby preventing it from making a clean contact and rendering the motors unable to run. I calledExcalibur Electronics six times and they have yet to return a call. Thebottom line is...the lounge is inflated, in the pool and not able to runsince I bought it because of defective parts. I've been a Mr. Fixit for 65 years and it appears to me that those parts had another owner before they got to me.I respectfully request that you replace both motor units totally.Respectfully, Ted Cole 13711 Vista Poniente Drive, Poway, CA 92064"
1,Intermittant sound,"The fact that this radio be digital was essential to me for clear station selection. The size and operation is simple, compact, light, with on/off and volume. It is easy to use. However, reception is poor. One station fades into another over 5 or 6 frequencies. Sound and volume fade in and out continuously. I bought this to hear NPR on my morning walks. It is frustrating to lose words and whole phrases and sentences, and the sense of the topic under discussion. I guess it is better than nothing. It is the first pocket radio I have ever bought. Are they all this bad? I wish I could actually hear what I am listening to without missing patches. Its not anything close to what I expected for $40.00."
2,not what i had hoped for,"I just received the radio and I must say that it is not as good as I expected. My biggest let down is the reception - which is not as good as the little sony radio this was intended to replace. Overall quality is not great. Finally, there is no clip to allow it to be attached while I am walking with it, so it is hard to store/hold while moving."
2,Poor Reception,"Purchased this radio based on the 5 star reviews. Perfect size, well made, and easy to use. Unfortunately, both the AM and FM reception were so poor that it was of no use to me. I returned it the next day and got the Kaito Model 1102. Wow, what a difference! The Kaito's ability to pull in the stations is unmatched. The down side is that the Kaito is much larger (almost too large), more expensive ($79), and very difficult to learn how to use (especially after trying to decipher the poorly translated Chinese manual)."
1,Short and Sweet,Wonderful radio for 2 weeks. Then broke. Metal connection where battery is inserted. Unusable. Frustrating. Oh Well.
5,Simple and easy FM Radio,This is a very simple and easy FM radio to use. The display is large for easy reading. The sound quality is good.
3,Good radio but not as nice as what you would expect from Sangean,"First of all, I have absolutely no issues with the radio's sound quality, reception or features. It sounds clear and loud and the battery life is great. However, compared to other products I have used from Sangean like the PRD7 radio, the build quality feels a little cheap for the price. It is really light, the buttons are plastic and have that cheap click to them, the headphone jack doesn't always hold the prong in place and the edges of the plastic casing are kind of sharp. I'm not sure if I would recommend this to someone else. At 35 dollars its not too far away from being a full featured mp3 player so maybe it would make sense to hold out for that."
5,very happy,"I am extremely pleased at how light this product is, yet the sound quality is very good.I have been looking for something to work out with for over a year. After I saw what this could do for the money, I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. Unlike an IPod nano, I don't have to pay for my music and I won't get tired of the songs played because of limited variety.For the price I know I made a good choice. I didn't want to make a large investment until I upgrade my phone so this is perfect.I highly recommend it."
5,Great little radio,I am very happy with this product it is compact and sounds and looks good. I have been looking for a radio like this for quite some time. Sangean isd a very good product
5,Nice for the price,Works well and sounds real good. Easy to use and set up the preset buttons for the different stations. Good buy.
1,"Great reception, poor materials","This is a very good performing radio. During the first several months, one of the station buttons broke. This was followed by the loss of the remaining 4 bottons. Tried to contact company to obtain service or parts and got no response. I will not purchase this brand agaim."
1,defective twice,first sangean Dt-120 went bad within 1 week. Turn it on and radio would auto turn off in just a moment and the lock started giving problems. Sent it in with no problems with amazons great customer service. Replacement radio had same problem. sent it in for refund and am trying to find different radio.
3,Battery Use,"I am now using my replacement radio. The first unit, easily returned to Amazon, had some kind of internal short which sucked down the battery life. When turning on the radio, instead of starting an E would show up on the display and then the radio would turn off. Tapping the radio lightly, some times required multiple attemts, then turning on again the unit would return to normal operation, but the display would show the battery life was substantially reduced. Battry life could sometimes be restored by again shutting down, tapping and restarting. Tapping while on often caused the unit to shutdown. The replacement radio does not exhibit this problem, so far. I have read several other reviews complaining of battery life, this may be a common problem. When working the radio is great, good reception, easy to use. I purchased a MP3 armband for use during workouts."
2,Preset buttons break off,"This is a small radio which you can use to listen to talk radio while falling asleep. The headphones are also the antenna and after 6 months it became positional. I had to move the radio and the wire to the headphones to get reception. Also, after one month one of the presets broke off. I have now had it 1 year and all the presets have broke off and it is unusuable because of the bad connection to the headphones."
5,Good Radio,"I got sick of my ipod touch and the songs I've collected over the last 15 years so I decided to pick up the radio and see what new music is out there.Pros:- Radio is small (as big as the old ipod nanos, although a bit thicker)- Excelent batery life. (1 AAA battery lasted me over a week at work)- Good sound quality on FM (Very clear sound on FM stations)- Solid construction (Feels like it won't break appart if you drop it, wouldn't want to step on it though)Cons:- Antena is part of the earphones (Meaning if you change the earphones you will loose the antena (not cool), although reception seemed about the same for me in both cases)- Weak sound quality on AM (The AM stations didn't sound very clear, at least for the stations I listened to, even with the earphone antenna)So there you have it, it is a decent radio, the question is, is it worth 50 bucks (bought it from Canada), and why are satellite and wifi radios still so darn expensive"
5,GREAT little radio,"I'm soooo glad I bought this little radio! I use it everyday when I walk and I use it at the beach. The presets are very handy and the battery life is exceptional. It's hard to believe that such a little thing can put out such a good sound. If you're looking to purchase this type of radio, you won't be sorry with this one. It's a little power house."
4,Good Value,Easy to use. Earplugs not the best in the industry. Good value. Good for riding on the bus and listening to news.
5,Great Pocket AM/FM Radio,Works as described. Great reception and selectivity and great sound. Great features. It is everything I wanted in a pocket receiver.
2,Consider something else,The text indicates that this radio will shut off after 90 minutes. It should read .... may shut off at any time from 90 seconds to 90 minutes. I have a table top Sangean radio ... works great. This little unit is another story.
1,Disappointing - No Speaker,"This radio has NO SPEAKER. If you want to listen to it, you must use earphones. I do not have any experience with any of its other features, because as soon as I discovered that it has NO SPEAKER, I returned it to Amazon."
1,Radio Review use and ease of operation,"I received the Sangean AM/FM1/FM2 as delivered. But that where it begins and where I start this review - The unit is sylish. The use of this deviceis not user friendly. Following the instructions to program the device, either automatic or manal scanning is a tedious process. Programing thestation selections is not straight forward, to put it mildly as when performing the memorization process does not do what the instruciton says it will do.The enclosed earbud earphones are marginal - something I did not expect for the price set for this unit. The alternative is to move to more expensiveearphone set. Ah, I hoped I would not have to encur another cost, but alas, I have to in order to achieve a better sound.My overall rating from a scale of 1 to 10, 1, being the lowest, my rate is at 4."
1,Died after a few hours of use,"I was really disappointed with this sangean dt120radio-- my 3rd attempt at outfitting myself with a pocket fm. I didn't use it that much right after purchase, so by the time it died on me it was out of warranty. I had probably used it all of 3-4 hours.I don't see why it is so hard to find a half decent fm radio that is small enough for purse or pocket. This is old technology folks! I know the new i-pod nano has an fm radio, but I feel skeptical about that one too..."
2,too small,"radio is very small, can only be used with ear buds, tiny buttons (it appears) did not even take it out of package. Returned it. I should have read description more clearly before ordering. Sangean pocket radio"
2,No better than any other old pocket radio.,Does not deliver any better quality sound than old pocket radios. At least it is compact.
3,Not completely satisfied yet,"FM Sensitivity problem with strong stations. After talking to Tec Support, was told to send it to them for replacement. It should not have this problem. The AM is great and the sound it very good."
3,Very disappointed in sensitivity,"Bought this after much research, wanting something a cut above the cheap tuners in most boomboxes. I can get lots of stations on my stock car tuner, that most common boombox radios won't pick up. Thought the Sangean might be a better class of product. But reception is no better than the cheapest piece of junk you can buy at Walmart.I have never been more disappointed in a product with so many positive Amazon reviews. Everybody's standards must be pretty low if you all think this unit has good reception. We have a 25 year old Sony tuner that probably wouldn't bring 3 bucks at a yard sale, that picks up stations that don't exist on ""newer"" radios. FM tuners used to have great performance. Now they have cheapened them to junk, and count on the uninformed public to just accept it. Too bad."
4,walkman type radio,This is a nice little handheld radio that can be put into a pocket nicely. It is small and lightweight. The one little flaw is one of the buttons for channel selection is very close to the earphone plug so if your fingers are large you may hit two buttons at the same time. Other then that the sound is good and quality is good.
5,Only the best,Nothing can beat this little radio. It does not lose the tuned station. Very good reception of both AM and FM The battery lasts a long time.It is so small you don't know its there. Sturdy and well built. I dropped this little radio in the pool not once but twice and it is still working with no problems whatsoever.
5,Love this small radio,"Besides loving the small size I love the feature that it shuts off after 90 minutes. I'd always fall asleep at night while listening to the radio, andwould have to replace the batteries more than I would have liked. This solvesthat problem. It's a good, well worth the $ little radio."
5,A great collection of booty-shaking funk.,"Picked up the CD in Amsterdam. I didn't know it was right here on the internet. If the music didn't have rap lyrics, I'd have sworn it was somebody's long lost funk of the 70's. Great bass lines on this stuff with some seriously funky effects on a couple of tracks like 'Chocolate Funk' (my favorite piece). This is some good underground funk."
2,White Boy Funk,"This album is OK at best. It by no means offers anything new to the musical world and as far as the funk goes it's pretty standard and by no means enters into the world of madness. They have all the elements of funk present, but lack the thing that takes it to the next level. I can't tell you what that missing thing is (soul, natural rhythm etc...) but it's not there. I was looking forward to getting it but was disapointed. You can do without this one."
5,kro and the apocalypse is one damn funky band.,"kro and the apocalypse is a new fushion of funk, rock and hip hop presented in an exciting and fresh manner. I have seen them play and heard this album. It is a steal at nine dollars. you won't be disappointed with its innovative style. check out the funk for it harkens back to a better day in music with the JB's, James Brown, P-funk. as they progress in thier music form, it only gets better.have fun with it and give it a chance."
5,Bye Bye Ladybugs,"I have been using the Bugzooka for several years to combat the ladybugs which infest houses in the midwest during the winter. It works much better than a dustbuster because the trigger bellows surprises them before they can grab on to anything. Sometimes I tape an opened-up paper clip to the business end to help dislodge them from corners in windows. A little pricey, but quality construction lasts for years and it really works well on slow moving bugs. I keep one on every floor of my home to make it easy to suck 'em up whenever I see them and it really decimates the ladybug population in my house."
3,Fair,Works pretty good on lady bugs. Do not buy if you need it for big bugs or spiders. Also difficult to trap spiders because they like to get in corners.
3,A little disappointed...,"It is not powerful or quick enough to catch the bugs I'd like to. You have to get RIGHT on top of the bug to have a successful catch. And sometimes when a bug is caught, it gets caught between the flaps and they end up getting smashed and died anyways. But it is pretty good when you do catch a bug, without having to smash it and kill it. It catches mostly the slower crickets that get into my house."
5,awesome,"Great product, i'm parricularly happy to get rid of the battery requirements. Longer extentable reach is a great addition. So much easier to use."
2,BugZooka,Overall the design is fine. The operation was not what we expected to perform.The suction of the product needs more force to capture an insect that have wings. Works great with insect that don't FLY.Southern USA is invaded by fly's. New design this product will be a success down south.
4,Bugzooka,Bugzooka seems to work well but we have had NO STINKBUGS so far this year. Will have to wait until spring for the full test with Stink Bugs and other bugs.
1,It's horrible,"Trying to create a Web site from scratch is impossible. Might work if you start with one of their templates, but not from scratch. The manual is no help. Tech support is a joke. Spoke to the same person in India twice, he had no idea about the program, and was basically reading the manual I had back to me. He informed me that my issue had to ""escalated"" to the next level and I would get a call back. No call. Next day I was told I would get a call back within the hour. I asked for a direct number, and was given a disconnected number. Never received a call. I will never buy a NAMO product again."
2,Ideal for a hobbiest on a budget,"The problem with Namo is that bugs abound in their software and there is poor customer service. The bugs that I have encountered are so inconsistent that it is really hard to say what causes them to occur. It seems that every so often a rollover goes dead. There is also a problem with saving different changes of files under different names... etc etc. If you go online for help -the moderators are likely to answer a question that you didn't ask and close the issue immediately.However, despite the bugs -this webeditor is well priced. If you persevere through all the issues and learn a little manual HTML -you will have a working website.However I must stress that if this were my only tool for mantaining and updating a website -I would seek another one. This is not a professional product and more suited for someone who is learning about websites."
1,"Don't bother with it on Vista... better yet, don't bother.","I downloaded their Vista patch, which says it fixes a problem where Vista reboots when the program is installed. Not launched. INSTALLED.Of course, installing the patch fails because it says the program isn't installed.Guess what happened when I tried installing, because I assumed the wording was due to imperfect Korean->English translation? It rebooted.No, it seems the linguistics were just fine. The logic of the programmers still leaves a lot to be desired, however. I had used this product 'successfully' on XP, but agree with the other commenters here about stability and poor customer support.Not to mention the program does generate a LOT of bloat. FrontPage may be Microsoft-centric, but the bloat isn't as asphyxiating as Namo's offering... especially with CSS... (FrontPage ignores it; Namo's needs manual tweaking or else it'll repeat every CSS entry...)[...]."
4,Powerful Source Editing for HTML Experts,This never reformats your handwritten code unless you tell it to ..when i used Namo Webeditor 6.0 (old version)i had a some troubles about handwritten code but this new version did not mess up my handwritten code
3,A Good Program If...,"...you can accept it ""as is"" with no hope of customer service.When the company was owned and operated in Korea, customer service was great. When I was having a problem they even checked my web pages and told me what the problem was. (It wasn't their editor.)Then they were bought out by an American company. Not only did customer service drop to zero, but the next version was so unstable (at least on my computer) that it couldn't be used. I'll take a wild guess and say that there was pressure to release it prematurely.The latest incarnation is much better, although it still occasionally crashes.Sad to say, some things should stay ""off shore."""
1,Get a real walker instead,"This was a gift for our daughter, and I should have returned it without even taking it out of the box. The activities on the dashboard are not entertaining, unless your child likes to make noise. Mostly at about 4-6 months, babies like to chew and suck on things- and they can't do that with the tot wheels. The two items that she might be able to chew on are located on the far side of the dash board and she can't really reach them, and they pop right out of her mouth. She mostly just gets frustrated with the whole thing. We usually take the dashboard off and pile toys onto the tray. However, she loved the circular walkers with the seats that spin 360 degrees that have all the toys within easy reach. The tot wheels is a waste of money- get a walker if you're looking for something like this."
3,"It was free., so I can't complain too much...","I got this as a hand-me-down gift. This item was great for helping to deviate the positions my baby was in throughout the day. Once she actually started being mobile, I found that the kickstands did not work on tile and that even with the kickstands up, it was not very mobile on carpet. It was also difficult to steer and my daughter generally just went back and forth.I'm pregnant with my 2nd and am in the process of researching other products."
1,BAD,This product should have more activities! I am not saying you are a bad company but I just think this product isn't the best product you've made!
3,Rear wheels difficult to turn,"I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter. My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll. Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side. This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one. I would not recommend it though. There are better walkers out there."
2,Good Walker but not Great!,"I had recieved this walker for my baby shower after I had put it on my registery. I had read all the reviews and figured that it was worth it. I first put my son in it at 4 months old, he loved the noises and also the star just like so many people have stated. The only problem I found is 2 months later he can only inch it in forward and reverse. It is very hard to move around the house even when I am pushing it. It doesn't make turns easily and it is very wide compared to the other walkers out there. He does love the noise but can't move it, although he does have very good strenght in his legs. So to him it's the same as an exersaucer. When looking for a ""walker"" I would have definitly went with a smaller more mobile model."
5,MY baby loves it!!,"My son loves this, he is now 9 months and goes all over the place, loves the mobility it gves him. At 5 months I put him it and he loves the sounds it made, didnt move around much, but now he is a speed demon and loves to follow me around. Yes common sense, DO NOT ALLOW YOUR child to get near stairs and they will not fall down them. You must supervise your child in this and for that matter in anything they are in, stationary or not, anythiong can happen. I love this walker and would recommend it to anyone who should be smart enough to know you MUST WATCH your child regardless what they are in."
4,Keeps baby busy!!!,"My parents gave our baby this walker for Christmas and I have to admit we love this thing. At first I was skeptical because our pediatrician told us not to get one (afraid she'll get hurt in it)and I've heard they delay walking. But honestly, we haven't had a problem so far and we do supervise her when she's in it. Our daughter is on the smaller side (9 1/2 months, 17lbs.)but I think it would be difficult to tip the walker over because the base is so wide and sturdy. She went from barely moving in it to zipping and zooming around the house. Sure it has its cons, but who cares as long as it keeps her entertained and allows her to move around freely, which she wants to do now all the time. I do wish it was portable so we could take it when we go to grandma's....."
4,Great for him but Mommy not so pleased,"My 8month old LOVES this toy. He plays with EVERYTHING on it. However, this mommy doesn't care for it too much. 1. very hard to manuver on carpet, I can't even move him when he's in it cause I can't get the thing to turn right, I think the bottom is too low to the ground and it just gets in the way. I fear my son will have to push really hard to get anywhere in my house other than the kitchen. 2. the brakes really don't work. I've sat him outside while we wash the car in the driveway and he can still move the thing with ALL the brakes down. Other than that we sit him in his walker and he just has a blast pushing all of the buttons and beeping his horn. For the price it's not a bad thing when I consider how much it keeps him busy when mommy needs to get some things done."
2,Not so Hot Wheels,"We recieved this walker as a gift, so were obliged to keep it. We would have bought a different one if it were up to us! The main annoyance is that the wheels fall off every time we move it unless our baby is actually sitting in it. Our baby does not seem particularly excited about the toys on the tray either. A friend has the exersaucer & our son seems to like it much more! We do like how it is height adjustable and easy to clean."
2,Pass on this one,"I purchased this walker for my five month old daughter. She had already been happy with her saucer, but I thought that she might enjoy being more mobile and less confined. First, the walker was difficult to put together and then when I tried taking it apart, it wouldn't disassemble. The toys are loud and startled my daughter. She grew disinterested in a very short time. The walker is bulky and doesn't roll well. I would pass on buying this."
4,Never used much...,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 8 mths. old. She never took a liking to it. She started walking on her own at 10 1/2 so this was something that was used myabe twice & definitely didn't need to be purchaed.I'm not a believer in using walkers anyway but you can take the wheels off to make it stationary for play, which is what we mostly did.It is a good product but I don't think I would buy another walker again because I don't find them functional or entertaining.The only complaint that I can say is that the wheels would fall off all the time when the walker was moved."
3,"Undecided -- so far I'll give it a ""so-so""","My son is 5 1/2 months and we just got this walker to give him some variation from his megasaucer. His legs are very strong and we thought he would enjoy some mobility.My biggest complaint is that the activity bar does not have a volume control, and you can't turn the sound off so that he can just play with the toys without LOUD sound. He cries when he hits the buttons because they are SO loud. Because of this, I tend to put him in the walker without the actvbity bar."
4,I doubt the manufacturers age.,"I have this walker for my triplets and I liked it fine. It got around well, and it (with close supervision) wasn't dangerous.However there's no way your going to get a 18 month old in this. It's not safe for one thing. I couldn't get any of my kids into it once they were walking. That was at 1 year. At 14 months they were running and there's no way they'd be held down by something like this."
2,Way too LOUD!,"Although this walker was easy to assemble and seemed sturdy, my daughter never got to use it. It is so LOUD that it scared her to tears. Not only that, but the noise completely dominates the whole room. Forget about trying to have a conversation or watch tv while this walker is in the same room. I brought this item back to the store the very next day. I am very disappointed as I did a lot of research on this product before purchasing. Perhaps if there were a volume control, I would then recommend it. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this one had to be written! Way too LOUD!!"
3,Watch out for the star !!!!,"My wife and I bought this product based on the reviews we read. Our 7 month old dtr really loves this walker. Our dtr was facinated with the rocket and the star and after playing with the star for less than a day, the end point of the star came out of the foam making the end point very dangerous. We immediately took out the star and contacted graco. They stated that there was no recall of the item and all they could do is to replace the tray. I was hoping for them to do something. Anyways this is good walker but just watch out for the star."
4,Walking Fun,"I bought this product for my 7 month old son who had begun to move around furniture. It's great!! He absolutely loves walking around in it and following me around. I found it very easy to assemble and like that the whole top console (the one that makes noise) comes off for play on the floor. He prefers to look through the plastic see through portion instead and watch the floor beneath him. I must say this, however . . . the noises are VERY loud. All in all - he seems to really enjoy it."
5,Great!!,My daughter is now 9 1/2 months and she was in her walker @ 4 months old. She has really come a long way in it. She really enjoys the toys that are on the walker. I would advise this to anyone.
3,Khalil's First Walker,"As my son started to get bored with his stationary toys, so we decided to get him a walker with an activity center to satisfy his growing curiosity. Well, he loves the walker. The only qualms I have are that it doesnt fold up for transport, and the toys are a little too hard. Khalil is still short for his age, and his little chin kept hitting the steering wheel of the walker. The biggest problem is that we can't take the walker everywhere he goes. Overall, Khalil and I are pleased and we both can't wait until he gets a little bit taller."
4,Comes in handy,As a mother who takes my daughter to work with me this walker come in handy. It helps her be mobile (which she desperately wants to be) and when you put the stationary feet down double as a feeding chair since i'm limited for space in my office. She loves the toys! The high back was great when she was younger. Only problem is that for the average 5 month old a few of the buttons for the toys are hard to reach.
5,Love it!,"I got this for my son when he was 6 months old. It is so much fun to watch him figure out how to work all of the gadgets. It has several things that keep his attention. When he is on the wood floors, he can move around easily. This is one of his favorite toys. I would definitely recommend this!"
4,Great for Nana's House!,"My mother bought this at a consignment shop for her home. My daughter is 7 months old, and rarely likes to be without Mommy. This is one of the only things she enjoys sitting in. We think it is great! Olivia can make lights flash, and likes the teething toy on it. And, coming from a consignment shop, this is extremely durable, and we haven't had to replace the batteries. She isn't really using it as a walker. We keep it stationary."
3,Need more innovation in walker world,"This may be one of the best kind Graco has made, but it has its own negative and positive sides:Negative:Bulky, not easy for transportation, hard to disassemble, does not colapse, needs more soft toys specially the Orange toy my baby pulls it & puts in his mounth...its hard on him..expensive, need more toys..safetly beltPositive:Its good to keep your baby busy for a while. I kept mine near kitchen area so I can keep an eye on him and do my cooking...(but he gets easily bored). It better to invest in walker then stationary entertainer as I removed the wheels when my baby was yound and later add it to the walker!its colorfull and attracts the baby instantlyHope this helps making decission for you"
1,I'm shocked!,I've read some reviews here and I'm shoked. These good reviews are not true.I am really disappointed from this book.I've read many flash mx books and I can say this is NOT a Flash mx book. This is a Flash 5 book badly (very badly) rearranged to the Mx sauce. It tells you that video in Flash Mx (!) is not so important so it is better to talk on using flash in quicktime. It talks you about Flash Generator (Generator is an obsolete Macromedia product and most of it's function are now included in Mx). I'm sorry to see the author dedicates the books to his parents. Shame on him.
2,"Some good, Some bad, Overall so-so","I found many of the example files missing from the download (which in my opinion is pretty weak - where's the cd with the examples???) that was a major disadvantage. The sections that talked about application development were pretty good, but most of the booked seemed irrelevant. I think the title Developer's Guide is a little misleading. I thought Developer referred to application developer, but I guess it is referring to any Flash development. The book does cover a lot of different topics from 3D to Generator (which does not even apply to MX????). So if you are looking for a book covering a little on a lot this may be it."
2,"Waiter!, the check please...","I have no other option than to agree with some of the others here who have found it necessary to beat this book up a bit. It's deserved. This book is really a Flash 5 book masquerading as a MX source. There is some sprinkling of material in there, but this book should never have been able to have that title. Of course MX means sales. It's the latest & greatest at the moment. There are plenty of great MX books out there... I suggest you pick one of those books up and leave this one alone. Sorry..."
2,you get what you pay for,"The only thing breath-taking about this dvd is the ad copy. The ""restoration"" comes from running the toons through DVNR set on high, which is no real service. Lines disappear, digital artifacts are everywhere. Plus there's a paltry nine cartoons. Goodtimes has always been the cheapest of the cheap producers. Unless there's one cartoon here that you have to have, spend a little more money on some of the Thunderbean releases (Aesop's Fables, Cubby Bear, the Little King, Cultoons, etc.) They are truly restored and rare films."
4,Pretty nice,"I've had this set for about 6 months. These pans are very good for the money. The nostick surface works amazingly well, you hardly need any oil in all of your pan frying. I was able to stain the inside of one of the sauce pans pretty easily. Besides that I haven't really found a flaw with this set. I also bought the stir fry pan for this set and that has performed up to the standards I have come to expect from these pans."
4,Histrorically accurate,"This model of a Panther is one of the finer models to come out on years. Though mainly for display purposes, adults will have hours of fun runnig it around imaginary battlefields. See also the other 21st Century items in the same line."
5,Beautiful Panzer!!!,"I bought my Panzer (and a Bf109) the other evening at Toys R Us and have to say that 21st Century Toys did a BANG UP JOB on these! The quality and detail is amazing. Nothing else can touch these. I went from being an ""online"" only guy who loves flight sims and racing sims, to being a collector now. When I see the XD line of products I keep thinking ""I want that one, this one, that one... etc. They are all so cool. If you like tanks at all, get this Panzer! Next I'd love to see an SdKfz 251/1 Half-track, same 1/18th scale. :)"
4,Solid Reference,"I bought this book because I started teaching myself Japanese with the Pimsleur audio series. The series is a great way to practice hearing and speaking a new language, but despite claims to the contrary, I think you really have to learn the grammar if you want to speak competently. I found this book to be a great supplement for exactly that reason. Whenever I ran into a verb construction in a specific context, I could always look it up in here and learn the details of application and how to generalize the expression.It's absolutely worth the price to have around."
5,Ghost review 2,"The second volume is just as good as the first, with monsters, vampires, werewolves and a demon in an old lady's attic, vol.2 gives us variety of things they have not delt with and things they used too. One of the best cartoon series of 80's. Worth picking up."
3,Damaged Box,"Product was supposed to be new, however, there was significant damage to the outer sleeve box. Other than that, the product was in good shape."
4,Volume 2 Real Ghostbusters,I tried and tried to get Vol. 1 and with no luck. I ordered this instead and it's just like back in the day. My boys love the movie and I thought they would like the animated series.
4,birds love this feeder,"This bird feeder is the only one I have found that allows seed to remain in every feeding level because of the separated sections and tunnel design for the seed fill. This design allows 12 feeding stations to remain in use. The small tray also gives Cardinals the footing they enjoy when feeding. This would rate five stars except for the ports being plastic instead of metal, so if squirrels can get to the feeder, they are able to destroy the ports. That won't stop me from buying this feeder as the separate levels allow so many birds to feed, but metal ports would make it perfect."
1,"good concept, poorly made","This birdfeeder was very poorly made, i received it and it all ready had a port broken off which i did not notice right away. Also the tubes inside that allow the bird seed to go to the bottom are not lined up properly. It is now hanging outside, and i have it all wired together, because the bottom portion has come off. I would be surprised to see it last through the winter. It was reasonably priced, but a better design at a higher price would have made a better product."
2,Didn't last long,The birds and squirrels tore this apart in no time. Spend the money and buy bird feeders made from glass/metal not all plastic like this one.Do NOT recommend this product.
4,I liked it so much I bought a second one,"I had one of these bird feeds for about 5 years before squirrels and weather took their toll. Three things I like about it (besides a reasonable price) : 1) massive seed capacity means I don't have to fill it every day, 2) number of access holds (12) means lots of birds eat at once, and 3) simplicity of loading (just pull back the top and pour). I only have two downsides - 1) small spilled-seed tray means I have to put a second tray lower down to catch spilled seeds, and 2) it's not squirrel-proof so I have to take other measures to prevent their access. For the price, I couldn't justify paying more for a fancy squirrel-proof feeder. I love this one and so do my birds! In another few years I'll probably have to replace it again but it's still cost-effective."
3,Poor quality,The bird feeder separated after filling it with seed. The feed should have been glued in (6) places and the glue was only in (2) of the correct places. The glue missed the correct location in (4) of (6) locations. This is the 2nd feeded received with this problem. There is definitely a quality control problem. I doubt I will purchase this feeder in the future unless Perky-Pet replaces the unit.Jan. 1 2013.I contacted Perky Pet and they sent me a replacement which was fine. Updated to 3 stars since they replaced the original feeder at no charge. Hopefully they correct the quality issue.
3,Uneven,I received this feeder three weeks ago and have some issues with it. The green dividers between the levels do not fit into the unit properly. I tried to repair this defect but to no avail. They just wont fit into the unit. The feeder still works fine and the birds love it but it looks like the dickens hanging there with the uneven green dividers.
4,My standard bird feeder,"My sister gave me one of these several years ago, as she noticed that I had to refill my feeders at least twice a day. I've had several of them since then. They are pretty sturdy, except when the raccoons get to them if I forget to take them down for the night. But I've been able to interchange parts. These are my standard bird feeders, not especially decorative, but the birds don't care. I love these feeders!"
1,lasted 2 days,"This birdfeeder is absolutely pathetic. The squirrels demolished it in two days! DO NOT BUY IT. I am now having an argument with the store I bought it from, they say that it is NOT a manufacturer's defect. Does anybody know of a yard without squirrels?"
3,"Very dry and factual, but informative.","Although certainly not something to cozy up to the fire with, this book will certainly provide you with a barrage of facts and statistics from the European war between Sega and Nintendo during the 16-bit era."
5,Wonderful book!,"I found this book just as wonderful as Fire Bringer. It is sadder than Fire Bringer, but just as detailed. I felt such compassion for Larka and her family and friends at times. I would reccommend it for anyone with a love for animals, although children over 10 would be more suited for it. Atlhough some found this, I did not think The Sight explicit over anything. Overall, a wonderful book!"
5,a wonderfully compelled story,"I loved The Sight. It is my absolute favorite book, the imagination of the author is tremendous. No one would have thought wolves to be so sensitive and loving! David-Clement-Davies described the life of a wolf almost perfectly, it's wonderful..."
5,The best novel about wolf I have ever read,"The Sight is one of the best animal fantasy books I have read. And I am not into fantasy, but when I saw the cover of this book and started reading it, I was instantly hooked. It took me a week to read this book and I loved every minute of it. The Sight is a power were a wolf can see through the eyes of anything it puts its mind on. And it can see different things in the water. For a wolf pack two of the pups possess the sight. But so does an evil wolf named Morgra who wants to possess the sight as well. Its a complicated fantasy novel full of adventure. I suggest you read it slowly though so you can get the concept of the book. But it is a very good book, and I am anticipating reading the sequel. But I got to warn you there is a sad ending."
5,the sight,Great book. I have the hardback at home but I wanted somethin to read on the go. Just download Fell today. Can't wait to see what happens.
4,The Sight by David Clement-Davies,"This was a wonderful book. The second in the series, ""Fell"" I think was a very good read also. It is somewhat obvious these books were written for a teenage reading level however they will be an entertaining read for anyone."
2,Gravely,"This was the first Clement-Davies that I read so there's no ""Fire Bringer"" experience. I wonder if it happens there too.... I saw the word ""gravely"" way too much. It became distracting! The character development and the story were fine, though a bit predictable. I appreciate the author trying to write from a wolf's perspective. I'm sure that that is hard to do. There was mystery, history, and a wolf language. That was lovely."
2,Disappointing!,"This book was very disappointing. It is not what I look for in a book at all. This is the type of book I read, animal fantasy adventure, but this one was not very good. It did have good detail and kept you wanting to read more but it was too depresssing. Practically all the main characters died, and the very main character did die! When I read a book I go in looking for a taste of reality, some death and despair of course, but I want it to end up with a overall triumphant and happy ending. I write books and they are not all happy-go-lucky in every single page but in the end it is an uplifting message. I was so excited to read this and I was very unhappy with it."
1,Get an editor!!!,"Oh, my God, get an editor! We have an emergency!! Thick plodding trite plot, predictable action, and poorly drawn, one-dimentional characters. The author introduces wolf dialect for words, then (ooops!) forgets to use it consistantly. The ""history"" is recreated and amended to serve the plot several times. He even has frequent grammatical errors! Amateur, amateur, amateur. Good grief. Thank goodness I only borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it!"
1,A review,"This book dissapointed me in many ways. If you're a typical fantasy reader and you're just looking for a book, trust me you will not enjoy this one. But I could be wrong. It appealed to me at the start but then I just wanted to be done with it. If there was an age rating on this I would say 12-30. Any younger would just be bad, you deal with dying and mourning a lot in this book. A bad read on my part..."
1,not good,"this book haunts my shelf every day. it worth less then the milk carton i threw out yesterday. This book was so disapointing and boring and ill never read a book by David Clement-Davies again. It was unfortunate that i bought this book for a trip i was taking- i ended up watching the prince&me on the plane instead. 90% of all the charactors (including ones that i liked) died. He spends the first 3/4 of the book developing them then he kills them off in stupid ways, for example, one of the charactors looks into a pool and decides to jump in. then she dies. If your hypnotised by the eyes on the cover of this book, or by the lame poem on the back, i have one thing to say to you. Don't be."
5,The Sight- Now one of my all-time favorites!,"I read this book because I saw that it was by the same author as Fire Bringer, and loved it! This intelligent tale of a wolf pack struggling to overcome a fearful curse, is a tale of love, betrayal, hate, and plenty of irony. I won't say anything else about the story, because that would destroy the many surprises that this author has in store for you."
5,What a read! It's impossible to put down!,This is such a fabulous book. I loved reading about the adventures of Larka and her pack. Morgra is a villian like no other! This is a must read for any animal story lover. The prophecy really struck me too. This is as great a read as Firebringer. I loved this book because of its extremely delightful plot. I know that I will read it more than once.
2,Too Preachy,"I love philosophical anthropomorphic novels, such as Watership Down, and I heard The Sight was very similar, so I decided to give it a go. The plot started off very interesting, although the characterization was a bit boring. I was very disappointed after having read the whole thing, realizing it was just another one of those oh-so-preachy ""we all need to be atheists because religion is dumb"" novels. Now, I enjoy hearing other people's various points of view on the subject of religion and heatedly debating it, but what I don't enjoy is having some one else's opinion shoved down my throat in such an obvious way (especially in what I suspected to be an entertaining animal tale). The Sight is not a story for those wanting a simple fantasy animal adventure. Also, just because this is a young adult novel does not mean it has to be so blatant! It would at least be a little more tolerable if it had some room for interpretation."
4,"Great storyline, but lacking execution","I thought this was a great book overall; the plot-line was sound and kept me interested. The only problems were in the author's writing style. I remember being frustrated by the random history throw-ins, and I also remember some awkward phrasing that made me shake my head sometimes. It is definitely worth reading through for the story, though."
2,"Show, don't tell!","This is my second time trying to read this book. Once again I didn't get far. I finally had to give up, again, due to the poor writing. Rather than showing us how the wolves live, he tells us ""this is the law"" and ""wolves do this for this reason."" Etc. Perhaps it gets better further in the book, after the initial setup. I don't know, I just couldn't get that far. I gave the book two stars, rather than one, since I didn't get far into it. Maybe it gets better, but I won't know."
5,Another Clement-Davies Classic,"This compelling novel gives a new twist to a very classic battle between good and evil. The heroine of the story is a she-wolf named Larka who uses her power of the Sight to try to defeat the antagonist of the story Morgra. This tale combines strong emotions, Allegory, and fantastic imagination to bring the wolves to life. For those (like myself) who liked Fire Bringer will find that Clement-Davies has done it again. It is very similar to Fire Bringer in ways that for true good to be achieved sacrafices must be made. But dont just take my word for it, read it for yourself and then decide."
1,"If I could read it, I might really like it!","I bought both ""The Sight"" and was thrilled with it ... until it arrived. The font is so small it is virtually unreadable to anyone who does not have very good, or very correctable vision. A true loss. I donated it to the local library book sale with that disclaimer on a post-it note on the cover.Please ignore this review if you have excellent eyes, never suffer from eyestrain, headaches or migraines. The same font was used in ""FireBringer""and ""Lorelei"", and I will add my two cents there as well.Thank you for taking time to read this, and I do hope they release a far more friendly font for these books. I will have purchased them twice in that circumstance, however, the other reviews lead me to believe it might be worth the trouble and expense.Again, my appreciations,Mare"
5,It'll blow you away!!,"The second I finished this book, all I could say was ""Wow!"" It TOTALLY had me hooked! There are ingenious characters, a marvelous plot, many legends, and even a curse! I reccomend this book for kids at a high school or above reading level, mostly because the book has lots and lots of confusing words and things like that. Otherwise, this book is a really good read!"
5,Even better than Fire Bringer!,"I read Fire Bringer, another of David Clement-Davies' books, before The Sight. I loved it--despite a little bit of droning in places, it was well-written, heart-wrenching, and kept me reading. It stuck with me well. But The Sight...for 2 or 3 hours after reading it, the story was pulsing through my head and thrumming through my blood!! Mostly the last 50 pages or so. It was also heartbreaking all the way through.I'm 13, but I think anyone aged 11 to late teens who loves wolves and/or a good story would enjoy this. (You should read Fire Bringer too.)"
5,Sight,"This book is a great work of art, taking place in the early years of Romania. It's a fight of good vs. evil, legend vs. fact, black vs. white and the most ultimate battle of all: human vs. animal.The beginning is rather slow, but it does pick up and it leaves a few details off that made some parts confusing. This is definitely for students 7th grade and up, because of the complicated and detailed parts. The story has an excellent plot, though it doesn't hook you in the beginning, grabbing your attention more around the 3rd or 4th chapter. However, everything is described extremely vividly and makes the wolves come to life. I defiantly recommend this book..."
5,Spectacular Peice of Mythical Fantasy,"This book brings you into the very personified minds of a pack of Transylvanian wolves on a journey to stop a hate-ridden she-wolf born with a strange power called the Sight from fufilling an ancient legend. Filled with mystery, surprise, and love of both kinds, companionship and some romance, this book won't let you stop reading till you're finished and will keep you hungry for more. Though the book looks intimidating for its size, if the reader loves the book it will be finished in no time at all. It is a must read for lovers of the animal kingdom as well as mythology and fantasy lovers."
4,"Better Than ""Salvation""","This penultimate Preacher collection builds up the series finale, but ultimately you're left feeling nothing really happened. I'm still left wondering what the hell ""Salvation"" was about that it needed to last a whole year. In any case, Preacher still hasn't hit its high marks from Le Saint Marie to Death Valley again, but hopefully the last one will be decent. Of course it goes without saying that this is a must-have for ANY comics fan!"
3,molerate,garth has done it again with the new preacher TPB .. not as good as war in the sun but better then any other comic out there ... too bad it has to come to a end.
2,Ex-Lover,"I've been reading Preacher from the start, and I used to love it. But this last one is a piece of s**t. Boring to the bone. Where's God? What happened to the original plot? It's starting to look like a soap opera with gore. Or maybe ""Dukes of Hazard"" with lots of blood and guts, I don't know. It's so stupid. Please Garth, I really loved Preacher as it was, would you bring it back?"
1,The Perestroika Deception,"In 1961, KGB defector Anitoliy Golitsyn told of a 40 year strategic deception plan to disarm the West in preparation for the final conquest of Communism. According to the plan, after an arms race, insurgent operatives would orchestrate mass peace movements while at the same time the USSR and ilk would engage in a final orgy of overt arms build up. Reagan served this all very well and when he ""won"" the Cold War, it must have been beyond the late Khrushchev's wildest dreams. Then came the ""great fall"" of 1989 - 1991, predicted by Golitsyn well prior (all according to plan.) Now the West are at their weakest and a restive Russia talks of restoration of the USSR whilst feigning cooperation in the ""War on Terror."" I sincerely hope the Pentagon has a plan for winning a nuclear war because today the odds are against us. We must start rearming immediately!"
2,worth is just for the hooks,"I have had this kit for forever and have never successfully made a project from it. The directions for how to make the simplest stitches are incredibly confusing and the yarn is nasty. Honestly, the best part of this kit was the hooks."
2,Great photography and projects but not for beginners,"When I first opened the booklet (it's really not a book) I didn't know how to crochet at all. Having read the whole book, I still don't know how to crochet. There needs to be diagrams on the project cards. There's no way to learn from these project even though it says beginners can use this kit. The photography is lovely and the projects are cute but I'm going to have to learn ro crochet somewhere else and then revisit this kit."
3,Disappointing..... not ideal for beginners.,"I really wanted to love this kit, because I have the Stitch-it Kit and Cardmaking Kit from Chronicle Books. It's a great publishing concept.The design is wonderful and most of the patterns are pretty great, but the instruction pamphlet (it's hardly a book!) is woefully inadequate for the beginner to crochet.The packaging is so cute that this would be a good gift... but supplemented with a better, more detailed introduction to crochet. I'd still recommend it, just don't expect that it will be all you need to get crocheting!"
3,a little misleading,The yarn they provide isn't enough to make a bookmark - a little disappointed with that.
3,Nice project but the tools loosy,"I like the projects that are in this kit, but the crochets that the author provides are useless. Within an hour of strating one of the projects the crochet G, that I was using, broke in 3 pieces. My advice to you: buy your tools somewhere else before you attempt to do the projects.By the way, the projects are not for novice"
4,The Beach House,"As a fan of E. Lynn Harris, David E. Talbert, and Eric Jerome Dickey, I would say Kenny Blue's book ""The Beach House"" fits right in with them when it comes to drama. The setting was ideal, the characters were identifiable, and the story itself kept my attention. I look forward to Blue's next novel."
4,The Beach House,"If you're reading this review, you are literally a mouse click or two away from ordering The Beach House. Go on ahead and do so now!Kenny Blue has struck gold with his debut novel, and I envision even greater things from him in the future. I am not going to get into analysis of his book, but will say that he has written a story that is humorous, fast-paced, and believable. You may very well find yourself thinking that you ""know"" one or more of the characters, which then makes the unexpected conclusion most interesting.I would encourage anyone to buy The Beach House!"
3,A surprisingly average book on the very fine CFL [Really tw-and-a-half stars],"Cosentino is a blatant complainer! Histitle really implies that the CFL is onthe way down and out (A 'Passing' game,indeed). Frank, a former CFL player (notthat good I might add...)implies that since1969, the League has been going down hill,which I don't agree with. Hey Frank, youdid do better work on the CFL Traditionstapes, which are available here at amazon-.com in both VHS and DVDs. Folkes shouldnot waste their money on this averagebook. Get Jeff Giles' instead: ""BiggerBalls""..."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this pan at Target and do not recommend it. After only 3 or 4 uses, the non-stick coating began to peel away from the rivets which attach the handles to the pan. I wrote Calphalon and the Customer Service Department would only offer a replacement pan, but first, I had to send back the defective product. What a hassle. Non-stick coating should not peel away from the pan, much less only after 4 uses. I wouldn't recommend this pan to anyone."
1,Awful non-stick coating...,"I followed their instructions on preparing food but 10 minutes into my cooking I noticed these bits of grey plastic wrap that were mixing with the rest of the food. The nonstick coating was peeling off! Ugh, the peeling got worse the second time I used it. Totally not worth your money!"
2,A Disappointing Book on a Very Interesting Subject,"If Mary McCarthy's only accomplishment was to expose Lillian Hellman as a duplicitous Stalinist trollope, hers would still be a life worth celebrating. She was involved with, or had something to say about every major social and political issue of mid-century. Her friendships were numerous and varied. She was married four times (once to literary titan Edmund Wilson) and had many tempestuous affairs. It's disappointing, therefore, that this biography is such a disjointed and discursive hodge podge of gossip, hearsay, and innuendo. Not that those are bad things, but if that's all the attention McCarthy deserves why not just let Kitty Kelly do the book? While the author may have had a successful career as fiction editor of The New Yorker while it was being transformed into a middlebrow women's magazine, she lacks the skills necessary compose a biography of a subject as protean as Mary McCarthy."
1,An impossible book.,"This book is tedious and nearly impossible to read. When one gets into the narrative, wham! Quotes and comments are jerked onto the page and the reader gets lost again. It's a shame that such a marvelous topic should be presented so poorly. Give this one a miss."
1,I agree with Joe,"I became so irritated with the presentation of this text, I never finished the book. Thus, how can I give it even one star?"
2,Misled picture,i was misled that i'm getting a good deal with a set of different mallets when i was actually only after a soft mallet. A misleading picture that showed the mallet set on this product was taken off after feedback. hopefully noone else got caught by the same mistake i did.
2,Tearing Already,The replacement lumbar pad is already beginning to tear where the hooks emerge from the pad itself. My original one lasted 8 years. This one is on pace to last less than one. Obviously these are not made to the same specifications as the factory ones.
2,Sad disappointment,"I'm loaded up with these Aeron chairs and like them very much. But you have to wonder why they don't produce a more durable lumbar pad.These lumbar pads need to be replaced from time to time, like yearly. They get become too flexible and begin to ride up their rails daily. They literally ride up the side rails that hold them every day. Over time, they bend too easily and it's time to get a new one to reintroduce the firmness they are meant to provide.Why doesn't Aeron (or somebody else) manufacture a lumbar pad to meet the intended use without failing so quickly? This is the weakest part of the Aeron bargain."
2,Mine tore too,I've had the same experience as others report where my back support tore. Seems to be made pretty cheaply as it is just two hard plastic parts embedded in some foam. Over time the hard plastic tears through the foam. Pretty disappointing for such and expensive and otherwise wonderfully constructed chair.
3,I glued my old one with success!,"My 10 year old chair had a cracked lombar support, in the middle and just about all the way through. I read about the replacement parts which do not seem to be up to par, not to mention the cost, and I decided to try to repair the old part. Sounds wild I know, but I glued it with a liberal amount of gorilla glue, and put it in a vice to keep it aligned, let it sit for a few days, rubbed off the excess glue, and...that was about 3 months ago and no sign of separation. Now if you sit in your chair all day, your results may be different (I do not), but so far it has saved me about $50 since I had the glue already!! Give it a try!"
2,Really wish I didn't this,This replacement lumbar pad only needs to be replaced because they break so frequently. I have to replace mine every couple of years since they tend to wear out and break apart at the end clamps.
1,Description neglects to warn that these cannot be exposed to heat.,"The Amazon description should reveal that these racks cannot be exposed to much heat without the nonstick coating melting. Sure, I can return them now that I've seen the warning on the packaging, but this should be included in the pre-purchase description."
5,Great use,"Wife and I use these all the time. Not only do we bake cookies and use these, but we use it for TONS of other items. I will deep fry almost anything and put this in a cookie sheet with a paper bag under to catch the oil. Pretty much anything you want to drain, dry, or cool these have done the job.I've had these for 2 years now and still work great. A little wear and tear but they are used often."
4,Great value; good performance,"While these are not as sturdy as a stainless steel set I have, they are pretty good performers, and a great value. The nonstick surface works well -- have not had any problems with cookies sticking, even the ones that are rather soft and sticky. Everything lifts off easily, and clean up is very easy (I only hand wash these).They won't stand up to high volume use, but for low to moderate volume home use they are a good choice."
3,Nothing Cheap Lasts...,"I don't know why I am a sucker for inexpensive stuff. It always seems to break...or fall apart too soon. These racks looked great. They are the PERFECT size for my counter top baking area, and fit in my dishwasher. After a few washes though they started rusting. I hate to spend much on cooling racks. I think next time I will opt to not wash them, or dry them immediately."
2,Returned-- not heat safe and small for a half-sheet.,"The title says it all. I never opened the racks because the package said not to use them in the oven--which is why I wanted them. The product description didn't mention this, though I should have known from ""non-stick"" (though some chrome options are considered non-stick too and are oven safe).They are also undersized for a standard half sheet pan which means empty space on the sides of the rack. I want the biggest rack that'll fit of course."
5,good value,"These are very nice cooling racks. They don't warp like cheaper ones do. Though the price is low, they are much better quality than most racks."
3,They are ok,"These cooling racks are small, they are not very sturdy and will bend easily if you place something ""heavy"" on them. When I say heavy, it could be a small pot.It works for me b/c I only use it for cookies, but I wouldn't buy this again nor recommend to anyone who needs it for heavier things."
3,Not for Oven Use,"These are not rated as safe for use in the oven. If you're using them for cooling only then you'll probably be happy, but I was looking for something to place in a half sheet pan to hold temperature after frying some fish. I also wanted something that would double as a way to bake things nice and crispy while keeping them off the bottom of the pan. If you're looking for the same uses I was, then do yourself a favor and pick up the CIA cooling rack instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OFND8W/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
4,Very versatile.,Seem to be well constructed. I hope that they will stand up to the repeated use that they will be put to! The price was excellent and they were shipped very quickly. I think that I will find many uses for these cooling racks. A must have for anyone who cooks and or bakes. An essential item for any kitchen.
2,Non-stick coating peels off,"After only two cycles in dishwasher non-stick coating peels off, though label says 'dishwasher safe'. does this make additional five words."
3,Nice rack,It does what it says. The reason for fewer stars is that you cannot use it in the oven and it's not dishwasher safe.
3,Non stick cooking rack,"I like the idea of the small squares on these racks. No more cookies falling between the lines. But I wish it was a little heavier duty. It's light weight and I hesitate to put a casserole on it to cool, let alone a pot of food from the stove."
4,"They work, What else can you say","Well made, easy to store, clean up well, I'm not sure what else to say, they are cooling racks - LOL"
5,Good product,Well made and cleans up easily. They are large in size and they stack easily for storage. Would buy these again if needed.
3,Rusts quickly in the dishwasher,"After a few washes in the dishwasher, rust appeared at the all the cross points! It comes off with extra scrubbing, but now I have to put something over the rack before using it to ensure my food doesn't get any rust on it! Wash by hand, not in the dishwasher! I would lower my star rating to a 3, but I can't edit the stars when editing a review."
5,"Work Great, Oven Safe","There were a few reviews saying you cannot put them in the oven, but I put them in the oven weekly.They work great for cooling racks and work great for any item you put in the oven that you don't want to waste time turning over half-way through.I put the rack on a cookie sheet and use them to cook fish, chicken nuggets, tater tots, etc. and it cooks on both sides evenly."
5,Cookies don't fall through!,"I much prefer mesh cooling racks to the straight wire ones for cooling cookies. Inevitably at least one or two cookies would slip through the cracks and make a mess, something that doesn't happen with mesh. The racks are no harder to clean or to store than the standard ""striped"" kind. And you can't beat the price at $3 each. The ""feet"" are fairly deep keeping the rack higher off the table allowing better circulation, which is especially important when cooling cakes."
3,Not oven safe!,"I bought these as I needed racks that would fit nicely on my sheet pans in the oven. Can't find anywhere in the product description that they are not safe for the oven... but does say so on the packaging. If this is what you're wanting them for, this is NOT the product you want."
3,Nonstick racks,The racks themselves are well made. The size is perfect. Look forward to seeing how long the nonstick coating stays. It seems to coat the metal in all areas. Though the ones I have bought in the past were not non stick and I even used them to cook with. Such as baking chicken. These were not recommended to do that . Still I felt they were well worth the money I paid for them.
4,"I'm not a baker, but smaller than I thought",I do like these cooling racks better than the stackable cooling racks I saw at the store. These racks will do the job for cooling cookies and homemade pizza crust.
3,Not for baking!,They are good cooling racks. My complaint is they cannot be used in the oven as baking racks. You do not find this out unless you read the small print on the packaging - it should be noted in the Amazon product description. I wanted racks that were oven-safe and could be used for baking and cooling.
3,Two versions of this product,There must be two versions of this product. Someone said theirs were chrome but mine are made out of some black material. I also wanted to use them in the oven but the information with them said specifically no. The information sheet also said to not use them as a trivet. I will keep them as a cooling rack but will get some others to use with my sheet pans.
2,Sad purchase.,"These set of cooling racks are definitely at a low price point, but sadly, it's highly recommended that you not use it in the oven or near any open flames, probably because of it's Teflon coating. The little grid pattern makes it a nuisance to clean. Little square bubbles of soap and water form, much like when it water on a window screen. To be fair, the cooling rack is specified as a cooling rack, but many other racks are dual purpose and may be used in the oven or on a grill. Also, because of the grid pattern, there is more surface area touching the product, which could undesired soggy squares on certain items.If you ONLY need to cool things on a grid, this is an okay purchase. I would go for something a little more expensive and buy something that will be able to withstand heat as well."
