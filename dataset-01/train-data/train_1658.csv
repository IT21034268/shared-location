5,Excellent Movie - Superb Documentary,"Jason Burmas at his best! Great documentary that connects the dots.Superb Seller. Fast, quick & easy transaction! Item as promised, delivered quickly.Thanks!"
2,I sold it.,Conspiracy theory.This move did not have anything to keep my attention.I feel asleep on this movie. So I sold it.
5,Must-see documentary!,"MUST-SEE for everyone and especially skeptics of the hidden agendas of the secretive NWO Elite/Establishment that have been hard at work to bring fascism back to life. To understand further, I recommend watching the following as well (watch, verify/cross-reference, think, make your own conclusions, ..continue learning): BBC's The Power Of Nightmares - The Rise Of The Politics Of Fear, BBC's The Trap - What Happened To Our Dream Of Freedom, BBC's The Century Of Self, Original Intent ([...]), Conscious Revolutions, Zeitgeist - The Movie, Esoteric Agenda, Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky And The Media, 911 - The Road To Tyranny, Secret Mysteries Of America's Beginnings series, The Money Masters or Monopoly Men, From Freedom To Fascism."
5,A Must See,If you can handle the truth then this documentary is for you. Extremely well made and well documented with easily verifiable sources.
4,Better Than I Expected,"This book has three things that make it a MUST read for pastors:1. It is concise, straightforward without being polemical, and easy to grasp.2. The author effectively combines evangelism and discipleship for the average church.3. The author provides user-friendly evaluation instruments.I highly recommend this book."
3,More Coffee Table Than Professional Book,"How To Design Logos (Forget about symbols and icons, there is maybe two or three pages on these aspects in the book.) is more for a general audience than the professional designer.It has 24 studios working on projects from large to small. One thing I immediately noticed was the influence of the ""net"" design style of most of the projects. Having been published in late 2000, before the dot bomb era: this was where the bread and butter for these shops was developing. Alas, now they must go elsewhere and their designs after only a year or two seem dated.I believe it is a good book for the non-professional. Each project has a small write up on how the design was done. These write up are no way an indepth study of the rendering of the logo. It does have great graphics and examples of the development of the logos.For the coffee table or non-professional I gave it three stars, but if you are looking for professional advice I would give it two."
2,Not too impressed with this one.,The picture is a bit deceiving. Most of my daughter's dolls don't fit in this carrier because the lap belt is too small and not adjustable. The carrier also rolls back when you set it down causing the doll to hang almost upside down. I was not impressed with this one and would have returned it if the box didn't get destroyed with all the other Christmas boxes. My daughter has only played with this once. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Grizzly 1/3hp motor,"I have had a Grizzly metal cutting bandsaw for many years, and it has had a tough existance (it spends all of it's time outdoors, albeit canvas covered). The motor finally gave up and that is when I learned just how much I depend on that little saw!Fortunately, Amazon showed it online, and I purchased a direct replacement from Grizzly that same day. It came within a few days of being ordered, and it functions exactly as it should. It is a capacitor start 1/3 hp single phase motor and the mounting was a snap. Hook up a cord and it performs flawlessly (also much quieter than the old motor!)The only negative part was the freight costs, but we are all victims of high priced fuel at one time or another."
5,As advertised,This TEFC motor is well suited for the wood working shop and runs our Beale buffer wheels with ease. It was easily wired and the rotation easily changed. A good bargain.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have an antique lathe that needed a new motor. The sealed version of this motor fit the bill exactly. Since it is a midi lathe and I am a hobbyist, it is perfect for the job. It looks exactly like the picture, the wiring compartment is standard size and the wires come with wire nuts installed (mine had two extras sitting in the compartment). Wiring was easy and the diagram was clear. The mounting plate is secure and the motor hums away happily with no vibration. It came with a key taped in the keyway (the slot in the motor shaft) so all I had to do was tap my step pulley onto the shaft and tighten the grub screw and the motor was ready to go. No key filing needed."
3,Enjoyable fluff!,"Shelley Duvall herself stars as the title character of this episode of her Tall Tales and Legends series, and her performance alone makes this worth seeing. This is lightweight romantic fare made watchable by an incredibly likeable cast. Duvall is wonderful of course, as are David Dukes as Levi Strauss (the blue jeans guy!) and Ed Asner (of Mary Tyler Moore fame) as Clementine's pop. There's not a whole lot to the story, yet it doesn't maintain the goofy charm of the old 49er's song on which it is based. Given the potential of the cast, this is somewhat a disappointment. However, it boasts a terrific opening sequence and score by Randy Newman. And, like I said, there's really nothing to dislike here; it just doesn't amount to much of anything in the end."
1,Dark Desire: A Vampire Novel,"This book is a really bad pseudo-gothic (and I don't mean goth) romance. Full of characters breathlessly declaring whatever for each other and then declaring it to someone else 2 pages later. I decided about halfway thru I had wasted enough of my life on this book and read the ending. I like vampire romances and actually own quite a few but this one was pretentious, overwritten and dull. Buy ""Undead and Unwed"" if you want a light and fun vampire romp. Or buy any of Laurell Hamilton's earlier stuff if you want more serious. But don't buy this."
1,I couldn't finish this book,This is the first of Ms. Moore's books that I've read and it will surely be my last. I made it to page 60 before I had to stop reading it. Parts of it were like watching Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula movie. I found it difficult to feel anything for the characters. Nor could I truly get a good picture of them. The plot skipped all over the place and I found it hard to follow at some points. I don't recommend it to anyone.
4,Birthday gift for my 13-year old,"I thought I ordered blue, but got a yellowish-green instead, but that's OK because it looks really good when lit. My son got a real kick out of this CD rack. He particularly likes the blacklight and rotating center. Jazzes up his room nicely."
3,cd rack is cool,"The motion blacklight cd rack is cool, my daughter likes it. The only problem is that you have to set the cds in a certain way or it will tip over. My daughter just moves cds around to equalout the weight. We like it."
5,A Good Laugh,"It's amazing how short some of these older movies were. I guess because they were shown as double features or something they figured they could get away with only having them be about an hour long.I would have liked this one to go on a bit longer because I really liked the characters and its a shame that it's' only as long as an average television show.I'm not going to give it less stars just for that though because it delivers what it needs to deliver which is light romantic comedie with a little bit of suspense thrown in to keep the plot moving forward.I'm sorta gettting into these older films without major stars, because I don't get distracted thinking about the major players."
2,Limp theatrics,2 1/2Most momentum accrued from the few impassioned sections that do arise dissipate quickly from faux-Godspeed despair mixed with apathetic indie irregularities.
2,Meh,"I tried some of this on a salad, thinking it would be really good. I do love stuff with garlic after all, but this dressing's flavor was awful in my opinion.."
2,A step down from Dead Girls,"I picked this up after reading Calder's Dead Things trillogy which I enjoyed a great deal for its fetishistic, perverse, and increasingly disjointed world. Frenzetta does create an interesting world which could provide an interesting story but it seems that Calder has lost his pace.One of the major drives in Dead Things was the fetishistic intensity which he sucessfully integrated into the plot. The same intensity is present in this book but the world he created disallows the same integration in to the story. As a result, it comes off as obscessive rather than interesting.I was even more dissapointed by The Twist so while this wasn't as good as I expected, it was still readable. If you're a Calder fan, its worth a read... as long as you find it used.Otherwise Calder needs to give up on the deadly dolly thing until he can make it work again."
3,Not as described in picture...,"The screw on portion of the rest is as described and will allow the user to adjust for windage (left/right). However, the actual rest portion is a plastic tab. The picture shows the spring loaded wire version. The plastic tab is shallow and your arrow will easily fall off. There is no ""hook"" on the rest to retain your arrow."
2,very disappointing,"I bought this book because I thought it would focus more on the special training an ex racehorse needs. This book contained mostly information on general horse training which intermediate to experienced riders/trainers probably already know. The begining of the book was the most interesting part because it gives the history of the thoroughbred breed. But, the rest of this book was pretty disappointing."
2,buying and reschooling ex-racehorses,"the book had good information,kept my attention & was easy reading. I was disappointed that it did not cover what I would consider reschooling of ex-racehorses. It was a good introduction to beginning schooling over jumps for horses that are already trained for riding. The book is geared towards people that have a certain level of knowledge and would not necessarily be good for beginner trainers. I am still going to get Coldrey's first book Breaking and Training the Young Horse. Maybe Buying and Reschooling would have been better if I had read Breaking & Training the Young Horse first."
1,still dont have it,"Ordered months ago. Didn't know until after purchase it was coming from overseas. All this time later I get an email for a review, and then I remembered I bought this a couple months ago and still haven't gotten it yet."
4,waitress,The movie was great but the DVD I received was defective and I could not view a couple of scenes.I am not pleased.
5,A delightful film,"Keri Russell plays Jenna, a young pie-baking waitress who finds herself in an unhappy marriage. She hopes to win a pie baking contest and take the prize money in order to leave her husband and begin a new life.But the new life she finds is the news that she is pregnant. Her plans are put on hold while she tries to figure what to do. Jenna bakes pies to reflect what is going on in her life. The humor in her baking and her extraordinary friends furnish support to have her daughter Lulu and to tell her husband she is finished with him.This is a delightful film and you find yourself pulling for Jenna the entire film."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This is like a very long student film, with an over-obvious, on-the-nose script, poor characterization, a gimmicky premise that doesn't work, stiff, uncorrected acting and lots and lots of exposition. Several actors I like are wasted here, particularly Nathan Filliom and Jeremy Sisto. I'm an independent film fan, but I honestly couldn't wait until it was over... A big disappointment after all the rave reviews. Oh, well. If you loved ""Thelma & Louise"" you might like this, but there are plenty of much better films to try first. (Axton)"
1,Absurdly syrupy and formulaic,"One must really be removed from reality to buy into the stereotypical, superficial and rediculously simplistic story of this movie - female co-workers are nice, men a jerks, friends are great...and the main character makes pies! How much more contrived can a movie get...?! Oh, I forgot, the OBGYN takes advantge of the feelings of insecurity casued by his patient's pregnancy and pursues an affair with her.For those desparate to watch Keri Russell - go rent some episodes of 'Felicity'."
1,TIME WASTER,"In light of all the positive reviews I feel the need to offer a warning and a dissenting view. The script is poorly written and the direction possibly worse. None of the major caracters is believable and the plot is silly and trite. The film veers without reason or control from attempted drama to seemingly unintended camp. It's impossible to accept the characters as real but, on the other hand, their absurdity isn't really funny. One of the worst movies I've seen."
1,Lame even by chick-flick standards!,"I agree with reviewer Lewis Jackman, who says this movie was way overrated just because Adrienne Shelly died before it was released. I could tell within about ten minutes of listening to the inane dialogue that this was going to be disappointing. Keri is soooo beautiful, but neither she nor any of the other characters was believable, except maybe Andy Griffith. (Like, why would beautiful Keri Russell even consider marrying an abusive meathead like Jeremy Sisto's ""Earl""?) Even the passionate love scenes were so exaggerated as to be ridiculous. The film was very anti-men, too -- other than Griffith's character, the men were all either weak, nerdy or abusive. Jeremy Sisto, who was so great in ""Six Feet Under,"" is utterly wasted here."
2,"wow, this is trash","There were parts of this movie that could happen in real life, but for entertainment, there were some things that needed major repair. For instance, nobody would've fallen in love with the doctor (he's so forgettable I forgot his name already) and then things started getting predictable when Jenna and the doctor met every time. I wish I had never seen this film....EVER! This is what I get for giving independent films a try....."
2,Disappointing,"Puts adultery in an exceedingly positive light; I regretted inviting my 16-year-old daughter to watch it. Very little development of relationships. Andy Griffith is stiff, seems like an actor in a local community playhouse production. Principals are attractive, other than their unfaithfulness to their spouses. Pie theme is cute at first but is overdone (no pun intended). Don't see what the fuss is about this film; I cynically wonder if its accolades were partly due to the tragic death of its director."
3,I didn't like Jenna,"I find it hard to enjoy a film where its entire framework is centered around affairs, adultery, broken marriages, and trying to make it all appear comedic. From the very beginning we know that Jenna hates here husband, that is made very clear, however its not made clear why. I watched an aloof, closed off woman show resentment, anger, and even disgust to her husband whenever he spoke or even touched her in the first part of the movie. Why? They don't say why, later they do, but not in the beginning and by that point I already had a low opinion of her, because she's also pissed off over being pregnant and having an affair with her doctor who apparently is happily married. I can't like these characters, they're so selfish! The ending is sweet, because Jenna finally got her act together, but it wasn't enough to make this film great."
5,Near Perfect,"As movies go, there are few that have the wonderful mix of emotional features which this hilarious narrative comedy serves up. It's near perfect: funny, sad, deep and truthful. There is not much more to say except ""see it,"" and you'll understand. Best served to people with life's experience, but children may also enjoy it if they're old enough. Sweet and complex, better than pie."
2,not that sweet,"This is not a comedy, it's a drama in disguise. If you want FUN, buy another film. If you like Felicity series and are a big FAN of Keri Russel, then go for it!However, if you don't like those corny and dull dramas, step away from it.The story is about a waitress whose life is a living hell: no money, a lousy marriage due to her agressive and heartless husband, an unwanted pregnancy, an affair full of confusion, a depressing job (except for the amazing pies she makes), to begin with...If you want to watch a boring drama, that's your chance."
4,"4 stars for acting, 3 for screenplay, 2 stars for lame ending","I really enjoyed watching this movie. Unfortunately I did not enjoy watching it end. For while in the end our protagonist gets some cash and gets away from Earl, it is not enough.The acting was superb. Andy Griffith was fantastic in his role as the crusty pie shop owner. Nathan Fillion was superb as the besotted obstetrician, and Keri Russell was fabulous in her pie-making down-trodden wife role.The direction was also fabulous.The script was a let-down. We like the doctor's wife a little too much, she's sweet. And Earl is not portrayed quite badly enough.I loved the pie-naming's."
4,Negative reviews miss the point,"I can't believe the number of negative reviews I'm reading... these people obviously miss the deeper points about the movie. It was produced from a woman's point of view, if that helps understanding. This is a story about a person who finds herself with one single thing in life to count on (her baking talent), the fragility of which is further emphasized by her unsupportive marriage and the affair with her doctor (which she resists). The writer and director do a beautiful job of telling the story that makes it easy for us to see ourselves in the same place. We can develop true empathy and perhaps help real-life women in similar situations. The film does nothing but inspire hope."
3,"Nathan Fillion, enough said.","Nathan Fillion is one of the best actors ever. I enjoyed him just as much in this as I did in any other role. He is consistent in his excellence. The film itself was not the best I have seen, I was not terribly interested in the plot, as a whole, BUT I bought it anyway because there were a few good parts. If you like Nathan Fillion, he makes the movie, as he does everything else he is in, otherwise...I wouldn't bother. Chick flick!"
4,an underlying tragedy,"This movie was well written, by Adrienne Shelly, who also acts in the movie as the waitress who marries her nerdy and obsessed boyfriend.I just found out that the actress was recently murdered. I will never see the movie again without thinking of her tragically, shortened life.This story is more than a slice of pie, but a slice of life...with a mixture of quirkiness, humor and serious dilemnas. Can the pregnant waitress leave her abusive and controlling husband? Can she find the courage to make it on her own? Will she really ever come to love her baby? Should she run off with her doctor, even though she knows this would hurt his loving wife?I liked how the pie making recipes of the waitress coincided with the concocted recipes of life...a bit of this, a bit of that...hoping it will all blend together and work out."
1,"Other than its quirkiness, this was awful!",MINOR SPOILER!!I really tried to like this movie. Original premise and all. Infidelity x 2 (pregnant waitress cheats on loser; doc cheats on decent person) + very old (but humorous) Andy Griffin does not equal a very good or very funny movie. Highly overrated.
4,Quirky Romantic Comedy About Dreams and Obstacles,"Keri Russell plays a waitress trapped by a controlling husband who discovers she is pregnant. Her only dream is to get away and win a pie contest. She has a gift for making amazing pies and its her refuge from the sad marriage where she has no freedom. When a handsome doctor arrives in town and pursues an unexpected affair with her, gradually her life begins to show promise of happinness with her baby and without her husband."
5,Funny and important movie,"As a man, this movie gives me a clue as to how women really feel, think. It was sad, sexy, funny and honest. Please watch this and try to imagine how the main character feels. The director was murdered before it came out so her role is somehow more deep now. What a waste, she was so talented and pretty, a young mommy herself. Andy Griffith steals his scenes and should have had an Oscar for his performance. Not for young children as the scenes are too suggestive. Keri Russell is graet and she has never been more beautiful."
5,Sweet movie. More than just Pie....,"I waited for this movie to come out and it is much more than I expected.I can't get ""The Pie"" song out of my head!!!!My little girl loves the song and we play it off of Youtube often.It's good to see these women working together and coming to resolution even though we may not always agree with what our friends or coworkers do!The ending is bittersweet with the little girl of Adrienne waving Goodbye.Adrienne Shelly had a wonderful idea for this movie.Such a tragic loss of a talented Woman."
5,"Loved ""Waitress""","This movie is without a doubt, one of the sweetest and most heart warming movies I've seen in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a purely entertaining and fun movie."
4,Another Pretty Good Chick Flick!!!,"As I've said before, I'm usually not a chick-flick guy. I'm more into horror, gore, and sick twisted comedy, but I watched this with my mom once, and it was pretty good. It has a lot of funny scenes and funny dialogue. It even has the legendary Andy Griffith in it. Jenna's husband Earl reminds me of Ronnie White from Rob Zombie's Halloween, and Doyle from Sling Blade. So, if you are a fan of comedy, pies, abuse, and Andy Griffith, then you'll love WAITRESS!"
5,One of my Favorite Movies,"I really enjoyed this movie. Funny, sometimes dry humor. It is very entertaining. Great acting and writing."
4,A Treasure,"This unhyped movie was one of the best I saw all year. My daughter (28), me (58) and my mother (84) all loved it. So....a PG movie for all generations! Don't miss it."
3,Not what I expected,This movie was cute and Keri Russell did a great job. It was fun to see Andy Griffith in a movie again. The relationship between these two really added to the film. A fun movie.
5,Surprise of the Year!,"When I went to see the movie Waitress I didn't know what to expect. After seeing this film I can say that I truly enjoyed it, what a surprise. Kerry Russel is outstanding and she should receive a nomination for Best Actress. I am telling all of my friends to see this movie and to buy it when it is released on DVD. I know that it is on my buy list and I have seen it twice.Waitress is a delightful film with some really neat characters. The less disclosed about the film the better. Do yourself a favor and see this motion picture, you'll be glad you did."
2,Disappointing,"I waited for this to come out on dvd as it did not play in our local theater.I found it to be disappointing.It had some great moments,but overall it was just a letdown.I rented it,but would not buy it."
4,cute story,"I think this movie is so sweet and a great way to spend a lazy Sunday but doesn't blow me over as a whole. I originally wanted to see it because of the back story of how the writer/actress/director Adrienne Shelly was murdered while still shooting this film, truly sad! So out of fascination of a woman's last works, I felt compelled to rent this movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot and it's girl power feel of finally letting go of a man who isn't good for you and getting what you want when you're ready. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it isn't smooth all the way through and the ending is a little wacky. But as a whole I would say, ""Go see it!"""
4,Only if you like dry sarcasm pie....,"I LOVED this movie! However, it can only be truly appreciated by those who love dry humor and sarcasm. Yes, it is cheesy; but you will laugh out loud :)"
4,"waitress sparkles, charms","keri russell's sweetcharming performanceis one good reasonto see Waitress, aheartwarming filmthat loses no timein capturing itsaudience.Add a dyna-micturn by the greatAndy Griffith andthe outstandingdirection and scriptof the late AdrienneShelly and you havea winner."
5,Wonderful movie,I bought this movie because my daughter worked as a waittress for many years and I wanted a backup copy because my original copy that I bought in the store in town had scratches in it from loaning it out to friends. We enjoyed this movie very much and watched it ourselves many times..
3,Try to Hold on to the End,"This is probably the worst pro life movie ever made. Despite that overriding theme, the plot is a verital carnival of marital infidelity. It's ugly, and none of the sexual matchups have the least bit of believable chemistry between them. The acting is unconvincing, and the pacing is slow enough that you may need a shot of caffeine to stay awake. But hold on! The screenwriter gives us an ending that's pure magic. It's as clever as it is redemptive, and for me it brought the rating from one star to three. If you do decide to see this one, be sure to hold out for the ending; it's brilliant."
1,Ths pie is putrid,"This film wants me to identify with a miserable waitress trapped in a loveless marriage and a dead-end job. I could if she had some redeeming qualities about her, but she doesn't. She's as selfish and narrow-minded as her husband. She must have found some quality attractive enough to marry him, but she isn't even trying to make the marriage work. No matter. I hated every character in this movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over. The ending was as flaky as turnover crust. Everyone should've been pie'd in the face for coming up with tripe like this."
1,"Unbox ""Unreliable""",Never received the download to my Series 2 TIVO. Was charged for the download. Be careful!!!
5,Sweet and really tastes like Blueberries!,"What a find! Yes it costs more than what you may find at the grocery but this syrup won't disappoint, and you'll find you'll use less of it. Enjoy."
5,An insighhtful look into the philosophies of a great soul.,"I was fortunate enough to find a copy of this book. Introduced to the idea of ""initiates"" by Benjamin Creme, another writer on esoteric subject matters, the title of the book caught my eye. The value of this book is is the direct account that the writer gives of ""Justin Haig's"" adventures. Other writers that I have read are only able to talk from the perspective of a student of the teachings that people like the Haig person of this book lived and taught in his life in London. I consider this book on the same level of excellence as ""Autobiography of A Yogi."""
2,"Good conducting, mediocre singing, poor sound, look elsewhere.","This recording is a well conducted performance in mediocre sound; it was a live performance broadcast from Salzburg on July 27, 1949. Furtwangler brings little or none of the magic of his Beethoven to the Mozart. Most of the singing is undistinguished. The better singers (Lipp and Seefried) can be heard elsewhere to better effect.If you want every Furtwangler recording, this is one. There is another Furtwangler Flute on EMI. I have not heard it, but with Dermota and Kunz in the male roles, and the same women in the female roles, it should be head and shoulders above this performance."
5,Grizzly motor was a great value,"The 1 HP motor went out in my table saw for the second time in 8 years and I don't even use it all that much. I went back to the OEM who wanted another $250 for a replacement motor. I went through some catalogs at work and things got even worse ($300 to $350). For those kinds of prices, I considered just replacing the table saw. But then I stumbled upon this Grizzly motor on line for half the price. It shipped quick, installed easily and runs great."
2,not enough torque,"Bought this motor (V#G2533) as a replacement on a Sears 10"" table saw. Model #133.29901. When installed does not have enough power to rip 2'of 1 1/8"" red pine. Even tried a 1 3/4 pulley. No luck.Grizzly says they don't have a clue why it won't work. Don't know how this item got so many positive reviews.Grizzly G2533 Motor 1 HP Single-Phase 3450 RPM TEFC 110V/220V"
5,This is an excellent mirage!,"Camel is one of my favorite groups and I have all of their albums. This one is my personal favorite and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is amazing how cool this album sounds when played really really loud!!!""The Snow Goose"" is my second favorite by them but you should know in advance that it is more New-Agey than most of their other material.It's unfortunate that this band has never recieved any real recognition by the media bozos... They deserve so much better... But, everyone I know who has had the pleasure of their music has liked it!!!"
4,Nothing new in prog,"Camel is one of the few bands that is famous for being underrated. The band did not get enough airplay at its time to reach the success of fellow Yes, Genesis, or Pink Floyd, but it did not stop it from releasing great music. Mirage, along with The Snow Goose, shows the Band in great shape, but I don't think it is solid enough to get a 5 star. The music is flawless, with lots of rich instrumental passages and catchy vocal parts, but it somehow lacks the conceptual approach of, say, Thick as a Brick (from Jethro Tull) or I Robot (Alan Parsons Project). While it showcases great musicianship and composing habilities, Mirage still stays behind the Snow Goose, as the second contains a more solid storyline and richer compositions and harmonies. Anyway, Mirage is still a great record you will not regret buying."
4,Prog masters from the 70s,"The 70s produced a number of great prog bands. Many of them are gone now but one is still plugging away. Camel was hardly noticed in the 70s, 80's , 90's and 2000's. It is a real shame because they have several great progressive works. And Camel is still progging today thanks to the wonderful talents of Latimer."
4,Smiles for you,"Luis Mejia (son) - The follow up to Camel's debut album, Mirage prooves to be a much more cohersive and astonishing, comprehensible album than its predecessor. In this case, the progresive rock seen is much more compelling, profesional, and correctly prepared and arrange, with subtle, rhythmical jazz expressions (""Freefall"") and exponential, infectious, elongated riffs (""Lady Fantasy"", which may stand as their magnum opus), the album has become one of their classics and most loved. The problem of their satiric and insipid improvisation is obvious in the customized prog pieces ""Earthrise"" and ""Nimrodel"", but as far as it goes, music is down to earth, and the classic lineup plays for the first time in a fine manner, but still they were not into any concrete fashion."
1,Don't Like the product.,Bacitracin Zinc And Polymyxin B Sulfate Ointment did not work for me. I do not recall why I purchase it at all.
4,A killer,"This video will be a challange to a beginning exerciser. Like one of the participants doing a particular crunch in the video said, ""This is the longest 10 minutes of your life.""One is able to quit anytime with no loss in having built up your energy to engage in the exercise, however, a cool down would be in order if some noticeable straining has been done.This was our first Kathy Ireland workout video and like it so much that we are going to try her TOTAL FITNESS video. She is a very pleasant person that seems down to earth with the viewing audience besides being a careful detailed instructor. db from Oklahoma"
3,Good for a beginner,"I have had this video for about 8 yrs. It is a good beginners' video in my opinion, but I have to say Kathy Ireland drives me a bit nuts so I have to turn her voice off. I would recommend it though, to anyone who would like to start exercising or who would like to do something low -impact (except lunges are involved for those with knee problems & there are some lifts that may need to be modified for those with tender backs)."
5,Underrated little gem.,"This game is my guilty pleasure of the year. I found a used copy of this for about $10. Why this isn't more popular is beyond me I thought it was more fun than most games out there. Kill bad guys and suck their blood, what more do you want? Sure it isn't the the most creative, original, or mind blowing game out there, but who cares?"
3,Vampires versus Demons and Nazis ... c`mon!,"While this game has excellent graphics and playability, the baseline premise and storyline could have been much better.I found that while as an action oriented - kill everything in sight - this game works pretty well, for the most part ...However, the RPG element to the game is almost non-existent and the storyline was one of the weakest that I've ever heard.The game is also surprisingly short. There are only two location sets to be dealt with: cajun swamps & nazi strongholds.If you're looking to kill something - often and badly - then this is definitely the game for you & you won't be disappointed.But, if you're a mature gamer looking for some roleplaying element to a game, seek elsewhere as this just isn't it ..."
4,"The qualities of ""BloodRayne""","The good:-Easy-to-learn gameplay-Everyone gets chopped up real good-Ain't it fun to kill...those cold-hearted Nazis?The bad:-Confusing gameplay at times-Graphics can be better(maybe not Rayne, however. . .)-. . .Rayne is too darn seductive to avoidThe strange:-Why can't those Nazis ever be greatful when you save their miserable lives?The awards for:Best cinema: The one involving that guy getting his ear chopped off. Very Brutal!The overall:-This is one bloody mess, regardless of a couple of flaws. If you like vampires, this girl is the perfect vampire it buy."
2,Rayne begins,"I find this game to be okay, I am not crazy about the camera and controller setup. I think Blood Rayne II makes great improvements in these areas.I bought this mostly because I am a fan of Blood Rayne, (I wish the movies had been better). I wanted more insight on Rayne's beginnings.So I bought it more so for brand loyalty. I think the game is okay, but the second one is much better.Blood RayneBlood Rayne 2"
4,Great Game!,This game simply put is awesome. Graphics and gameplay are incredible. The only reason i give it 4 stars and not five is because I found the game rather easy and feel it should have been made a little more difficult
4,Blood Rayne kills!,"This game is great! The graphics, the beggining. Whoa! The button handling is the best! It is a 10/10 in my voting scale. You can choose between third and first person. This game is great. Please, please BUY IT!"
3,Gets better as you go along,"Blood Rayne is an interesting concept that the manufacturers should have taken further. The main character is the typical scantily-clad, unnecessarily jiggling bombshell...with fangs. The controls are easy to master once you get into the game and the concept is pretty simple. The goal for the game is clearly defined although not always easy to obtain. When I first started the game, I thought it was lame and boring, but after completing the early levels the game improved. Later levels employ much better graphics and story. Stick with it, you will like it in the end."
3,Save your money.. just rent it.,"BloodRayne is another third-person action game featuring a typically scantily clad female vampire as the main character.The first part of the game is actually pretty boring... so don't give up on it right away. After an hour or so the game does beging to get pretty cool.You play the game as Agent Rayne, a half-human, half-vampire who has all of a vampire's traditional strengths yet hardly any of its weaknesses.The controls of this game are really easy. You can pick up any of the weapons that the bad guys dropped. Even better is that firing the weapons are as simple as pressing a button, since the weapons auto-target.Overall, I think this game has really low replay value and that makes it suited to be a rental."
3,Very fun game/except for ending.,I really enjoyed this old game except for the ending. I found it to be a bit too challenging to where I had to cheat to get thru it. I actually played BloodRayne 2 first. That's why I bought this one. Besides some areas being too challenging with no difficulty setting it was totally fun. I play to have fun and overall it was a fun game. Loved the one liners and the gore/body parts flying. :-)
3,"Nazis, Blood, and Cleavage","Hard to see what the excitement is about. The graphics are nothing special. The game is rather shallow -- kill people and suck the blood from their jugular vein. Killing Nazis is always a plus, though.The controls are rather easy to pick up. You can use a variety of different views, such as aura view (looks similar to infrared), dilated perception (slow motion), and extended vision (zoom). Not much skill involved with the combat; it is more or less hack and slash.The theme of the game is raw violence combined with sensuality. I&#146;m sure this alone is what is drawing most of the positive remarks."
3,Bloodrain,This is an extremely violent game. One of the first times I have heard explicit language used by a character. This game should not be played or seen by anyone under 17. The rating is right on. My wife saw me playing this game and signed me up to see a shrink.
2,A socialist's view of a Victorian-era religious reformer,"Hattersley, author of ""Choose freedom: the future for democratic socialism"" smears this colossus of Victorian reform, John Wesley, from the standpoint of a 21st century secularist. This is just more sanctimonious blather disguised as impartial scholarship that belittles the great men of a much harder time than ours. Britain's best thinkers, like Wesley, used to help make the world a better place in which to live, whereas the present-day elites' shallow, smirking arrogance perpetrates only self-reinforcing misery for those who fall prey to their humbug. No surprise that other readers find the subject, as (mis-)represented here, difficult to like. By focusing on what is least meaningful about Wesley (his women), Hattersley trivializes a subject that deserved genuine sopistication, not cheap sophistry."
1,The Belittling of John Wesley,"John Wesley, outside of biblical characters, is my hero of the faith. From page 1 Hattersley, sarcastically belittles this great man of faith. After having read many works by other authors about Wesley as well as Wesley's journals and sermons, it is impossible to imagine that this is the same Wesley I have grown to deeply admire. Hattersley writes with an attitude that will be obvious to readers familiar with Wesley's tremendous legacy. Reading Hattersley's work about Wesley's life is comparable to reading a book about the Bible written by one of the fallen angels. I cannot in good conscience recommend such a distorted view of this giant in the faith."
3,Just right for the camcorder... nothing else!,"This bag is only big enough for the camcorder, period. No cables, no extra tapes, just the camcoder. Small zippered pocket can be used to store the remote, maybe. I am able to cram a spare battery, barely, in with the camera, but a charger? Forget it. Should have gotten the larger bag for less money, go figure. That way I could have put everything together. It does protect the camera, with a snug fit, and is very light. A good choice for day trips."
2,Has no... soul,"No, this D-movie not only had no soul it had very little production values as well. The best looking thing about the whole movie was the DVD cover of the pretty girl.The ""ghosts"" were regular people walking around in a little white-face makeup and warty prosthetics that I could buy at the local Halloweeen store... and do a better job of applying!The acting was horrible, the cinematography was sorely lacking, and worst of all the plot was just stupid. I bought the movie expecting a good-to-excellent ghost story and instead got a lesson in bad movie making.Still, I have my DVD cover to look at..."
3,Good story... With some good ideas but I question it.,"This is an interesting story of one man's recovery from aids. Basically this guy Roger Cochran MD totally recovered from being at the brink of death with AIDS by doing a juice fast, stopping taking all drugs and coffee and going on a vegetarian raw diet and a couple of other lifestyle changes including falling in love.When this story happened they didn't have the same advanced testing that they now have for aids and hiv so i kind of question weather he had it at all. I don't have any question that switching to a non toxic live style can heal many things possibly even aids but I am not convinced. Also long term diets like he described don't work for most people in my opinion. This is based on my own experience and from meeting patience of a friend of mine who owns a world renowned fasting clinic."
5,The reality of the mafia Medical and Pharmaceutical worldwide.,"Our body is capable of curing all diseases, but the disease is a business, and not interested in curing patients.Excellent book ... everyone should read it."
2,Bitter taste!,This was bitter and disgusting. You would be better off just drinking the ginseng tea. It hardly has any ginseng in it. Most of it is alcohol and caffeine.
1,2 different preservatives,"If I would have known this product contained sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. I didn't even open it. As soon as I read the ingredients I logged on here to return. I ended up going to a health store China Town before this package arrived and found a variety of different ginseng's that came in a pack of 30 and all of them were less than $10! Some had preservatives and some didn't. Not only did I save money but I purchased a safer product compared to this one. I'm not saying this product doesn't work, but the preservatives it contains will do more harm than good over a period of time. Do the research for yourself."
4,Soundtrack of Misanthropy : Deep Dark and Artistic,"While reading ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" do your self a favor and pop this CD into your player and read on. This CD is the perfect soundtrack of misanthropy. It is driving with a dark ambience created through samples heavy guitars and keyboards and of course Michael Moynihan's vocals. I am impressed with this album as I was the day I picked it up at Bleeker Bob's. The labeled it as ""Depressing Dark Morbid yet Thoroughly Enjoyable"" With a big address label on the cover. This was enough for me. I bought it and can agree more with that six word review. It is a deep and disturbing piece of work but it is truly artistic and a great album. If you haven't added this to your collection yet do so now. It is a shame Blood Axis hasn't made more albums because ""nothing is above that soul"".Ted Murena"
5,This is the 2nd time I've writen a review for Blood Axis....,"This was the first Blood Axis that I heard, when I bought it from Resistance Records a few years ago. It is an excellent album if you have a sense of adventure and you're looking for something new and orignal. Also look for their album BLOT: Sacrifice in Sweden."
4,good music...,"This is an overall very inovative release, great black industrial. But before you pick up this album go to mr. Moynihan's official website and read all about his ideology and see what Blood Axis is all about. The thing is--the man is a hardcore fascist in every meaning of this word. I don't let the rumors about Douglas P. prevent me from enjoying Death In June music, but what I read in Blood Axis interviews is nauseating... Decide for yourself if you want to support someone with such extreme hate for other human beings... CMI IS NOT A NAZIPUNK LABLE MISTER MOYNIHAN!"
3,"Basic entry level 15"" monitor-good for business setting","I use this monitor at work from time to time, does all that is necessary for a workstation type situation, but is not one that will please gamers and heavy users of the computer/internet. It is minimally adjustable (change angle of tilt), but no height adjustment here are the simple specificationsbrightness level 250 nits,maximum 1024 x 768 resolutionWide 130 degree viewing angles450:1 contrast ratioShould work good in a professional business environment, but less for home needs. Good price also."
5,HP 15 in. lcd monitor,"this is an upgrade from what i did have. so far this monitor's been pretty good. it doesn't take up as much space like my last one did, it was one those older monitors with the picture tube."
3,Painful to read,"This book is painful to read. I like the subject and I am very interested in the author's point of view, but I found myself skipping paragraphs and sometimes whole sections at times. I guess he is trying to make his arguments be more intuitive by giving examples from ""real life,"" but I found his examples mostly irrelevant and even confusing. I think this is mainly because he tries to keep his tone light and not too academic, but being an academic I found his style of writing very distracting.I also didn't like the ordering of his arguments. He talks about Arrow's Impossibility Theorem for 20 pages without even remotely describing what it is. If you are familiar with the theorem, you would be fine. However, for someone who is new to the subject, I think this is not the best way to learn it.I was considering this book as supplementary reading in my Political Economics class, but I don't think my advanced undergraduate students would find the author's style interesting or approachable."
3,"Great idea, but needs work","They had a great idea when making this book, after all, every child wants to see himself having a grand adventure, but the rhythem of the prose was so off that the tongue stumbles, distracting from the book."
1,"looks cool and is very bright, but don't last, have two and have regrets","I was very impressed with Coast Products. I have two LED Lenser flashlight and few months ago bought a 7468 headlamp, and was impressed at first with how bright it was and bought another soon after that. My first 7468 stopped working few weeks ago and Coast replaced it with another, which I haven't opened yet. Now the second one I bought and barely used is broken.. Even thought Coast has lifetime guarantee, it is made in China and the quality is only skin deep. If you want to keep spending postage to send back to Coast for replacement, give it a try, I can sell you mine for cheap too."
4,Character studio,"This book is rather short, and quite expensive considering the length. Still, it contains alot of information. It spends the most time covering character studio, which was what i was looking for. Also, it goes over a few plugins, so if you want to use that part of the book, make sure you have the plugins.Overall, it was a pretty good book."
1,"Racist, even for an artifact","I could NOT get past the anti-native bias in this one. I'm a big fan of old westerns so I can overlook a lot of stuff for the fun of the genre, but this one went a little too far. If you're White Like Me and have yet to experience Liberal Guilt, this may be the movie that can push you from ""still not feeling anything yet"" to ""oh my god turn it OFF! I gotta go donate money or volunteer someplace IMMEDIATELY!"""
2,Not a keeper,"I purchased this book when I started a project that was going to use RSVP. I was disappointed. They coverage of the protocol is OK, but the coverage of the information transported by the protocol is aweful. I was left with the questions, ""OK, but what is RSVP good for?""."
2,"What A Waste,","This is a Norman Granz production. Hard to believe with all this ""talent"" that the results could be so mediocre. With Edison, Eldridge, Lockjaw, Flanagan, Dickensen, Green etc it should have really swung, but evidence is here that jazz started to go down hill in the 70""s and this is one of the reasons why"
1,A compiler that makes you feel RETARDED,"""...the first and important part is where its difficult. Setting up the compiler is very poorly explained you get virtually no help from the read me.""... & good luck finding help on Google. The author makes such a big deal about starting with C++ as your first language and proceeds to screw beginners by page 12, hilarious >.>"
5,Best Beginner's Book,"At first I was skeptical with the purple character on the front of the book that this would be a book that would make me feel childish, it didn't, it made me feel like a beginner and that this book would change that.I was impressed, they really covered everything in a way that is easy to understand. Despite some typos, I was able to work around those because I had already known that those were typos, probably because I learned so well in the book to know that they were wrong.I liked how they used a simple fraction program to explain objects and classes. It's as small as you can get, but you really understand how classes work without something confusing and at a level where most people do their classes. You basically build your knowledge after that.Despite the minor errors in the book, I enjoyed reading this."
4,"easy to understand, for beginner","if you want to have a glance at programming, this book is for you. It is written in a very simple manner that everyone can understand. Although I found many C++ tutorials on the internet, I still prefer this book for its easiness and simplicity. This book is shipped with a CD including a compiler for Windows. I use Linux but still i can follow every instruction .Many tutorials found on the net does not work on Linux platform, some are obsolete.I recommend this book for beginner like me."
5,Great learning aid for C++,"I couldn't state it any better than Dusty Williams did. This is a great first book to learn C++ with. It's clear and easy to follow, everything is explained and you are told the what, where and why of everything.Even for someone like me who doesn't enjoy reading, you are kept interested following along with this book."
2,C++ without fear,Although the actual programming itself is helpful the first and important part is where its difficult. Setting up the compiler is very poorly explained you get virtually no help from the read me.
5,opinion,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
2,Not the Same,I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago. The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small. I sent them back and got a refund.
5,Oh so comfy,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, it isso comfortable, my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust. If you want a comfortable shoe, a good looking shoe, I recomment this one. And the price was right!"
1,THESE ARE GOING BACK!,"I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer ""Scout"" pair which I already own and love. I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic. I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However, after receiving them, they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout. They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money. The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper, padded sole, and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather. The sole is not padded and sinks in. The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone"
4,Izo,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
5,A Sandal for all Ocassions!,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
4,Most comfortable shoes,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
1,Naturalizer Women's Scout Sandals,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
5,sandals,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
5,Scout Sandles,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
3,"The Forgotten Survivors of Viet Nam - the ""secret"" casualties","Today organizations like the American Widow Project do amazing things to support the nation's current ""war widows"", women who are themselves often not much older than Hero Mama was when her husband died in Ia Drang. This book is something ea cabinet member, ea member of the Joint Chiefs and ea and every Congressman/Senator should be made to read.As a veteran of the Gulf War who came home to become an RN much of what this author writes about resonates deeply. A career as an RN or LVN has helped a legion of talented determined women escape mediocre jobs and build incomes for their families. I salute and celebrate them all."
4,Good read!,"We don't always think of the families left behind when a soldier dies, Spears-Zacharias story explains why those stories should be told."
5,After the flag has been folded,I am a big fan of this book. It takes a lot of courage to tell a story like this. Read it.
1,great book...sent bad,Looked like a great book but it was sent to me really worn out & tattered; it was returned because it was going to be a gift. Terrible.
5,Great Book!,"I am extremely delighted with my most recent purchase from the Bibliolife Reproduction Series. The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition, like new!"
3,Dated,Quite well written but the attitude to drugs in the sixties was very different to now. Hence the dated outlook of the hero.
4,a great book for those interested in china's church history,what makes this a great book is the final chapters on the present situation and the reality of the state endorsed churches and the housechurch networks. a very nuanced discussion. i would reccommend reading the recent biography of griffith john to round out the consideration of the contribution of western missionaries. occasionally their contribution is underestimated.
1,"Not 65Watt, and connector doesn't fit","For one, the adapter is not 65W. As marked, it provides a maximum 2.65A at 24V. 24V * 2.65A = 63.6W.Next, I received the adapter and the connector was slightly too large for my PowerBook G4. It's useless to me. I can't plug it in.Buy one of the other options instead. I really hope the vendor lets me return this thing."
3,My former student's masterpiece<G>!!!,"This is a charming and succinct work explaining the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation and showing how they relate to our time... I should have known that the author would produce such a great work, because he was my precocious 7th-grade science student when I was a Peace Corps Volunteer at Cayon High School, Cayon, St. Kitts & Nevis!!! I knew he was destined for great things, but I never thought he'd be a PUBLISHED AUTHOR!!! Congratulations, Ray L. Edwards!! Your former teacher remembers you!!! -- Philip H. Costa"
4,A helpful guide for multimedia managers,"After reading this book I found it very helpful on my job (I am a Webmaster and Multimedia Developments Manager in an University). It helped me to get a ""top level view"" on multimedia projects and also help me to organize better my ideas, and to have a clear overview of tasks involved in any multimedia development. I really recommend it."
3,A Decent Introduction,"""Managing Multimedia Projects"" is a good introduction for the software/multimedia newbie, or for the manager who needs to understand the basics of what the staff is talking about. I used this book as a jumping off point, and found the chapters on ""The Perils of Partnership"" and planning and scheduling most helpful.However, Strauss covers a lot of ground (web sites, kiosks, slide shows, cd-roms) in about 200 pages, which means that the surface has only been scratched. Read this to figure out what it is you don't know, then come back to Amazon.com."
3,Masters at Work Presents India - To Be In Love 2,"The second disc of To Be in Love features mixes by Full Intention, which are competent enough to work on the dancefloor, but don't make an impression beyond that. It's wonderful club fodder, to be sure -- but club fodder nonetheless. The original mix by Masters at Work, with its funky disco bass, easily surpasses the Full Intention mixes on this disc."
1,thought i had bubonic plague,"i've travelled around the world several times. always in coach, always without getting colds or flu after the long flights. i wore the purifier on a long-haul flight and a few days later i developed a sickness worse than anything i'd ever had. cough, flu, bronchitis, wheezing, sinus agony. i've flown several more times since without and did not get sick. coincidence? maybe. but i won't use again."
2,Ionic Air Purifier,"I don't think this works, I already replaced the batteries and it won't do anything,the blue light keeps blinking, which it means that the battery is low and it has a brand new one, I need to get it exchanged, it is very inconvenient to face this problems, when I buy items I expect them to work properly not to have issues with them, my email address is laura_cepeda@yahoo.com"
5,Great book for every research library.,This book is packed with valuable information and looks overwhelming at first but if you want to know more about the mormons you can't go wrong here. A must have for every research collection.
3,From true belief to true belief,"Maybe you should read Eric Hoffer's book 'The True Believer' before reading the Tanners. They are not trying to rid you of your desire to be a true believer, they are only trying to get you to switch to something else in which to truly believe. Even if I agree with all of the facts as they present them, I still find it fanatical on their part that they should have devoted so much time and energy to trying to destroy their former church, simply to get you to become another type of holy roller. Nobody but a fanatic would sit there with two different editions of a 600-page book and count all the discrepancies, all 4,000 of them. It would amuse me if they got to Heaven only to find a flagpole by the pearly gates with a banner flying from it decorated with a crescent and star."
1,Yellow Journalism,"I have read this book about 3 times in the last 12 years, mostly due to studying with non-LDS people, and have concluded with each reading that this is nothing but religious muckraking targeted against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! I am, of course, a Latter-day Saint, who also has read other materials from this couple, and have studied the lives of the Tanner's, Ed Decker, Fawn Brodie, Dee Jay Nelson, and Walter Martin - all these together seek to discredit the LDS Faith and its people by spreading falsehood, distortion, half-truths, etc. I'm thankful that for those who SERIOUSLY study this book, and the background of the Tanners, that they will come to know the deceptive practices they use in this book and journalistic techniques to lure people to believe that there is something seriously sinister within the LDS Church. Unfortunately, some people will not take the time to truly investigate the Tanner's motives."
2,Flawed,"This book is THE anti-Mormon book of all time by perhaps the best-known ex-Mormons. Notwithstanding, it has many flaws. For example, the Tanners criticise Joseph Smith for having made changes to the revelations from the 1833 ""A book of Commandments"" and the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. What they ignore is that the Bible, a text that, as Evengelicals, they believe to be inerrant, is replete with prophets editing their revelations and the revelations of other prophets. THis is clear when one reads Jeremiah 36:28-32b; compare the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5; and compare Jeremiah 52 with 2 Kings 24-25 and Isaiah 36-39 with 2 Kings 18:13-20:19. If Jeremiah, Moses, and Isaiah can do such, why is it so problematic that Joseph Smith did the same thing as previous prophets of the Lord?This is just one brief example of the many flaws as contained in this book. I welcome back feedback at irishlds87@yahoo.com"
3,"Good book, tough reading","I am opposed to the teachings of Mormonism and enjoy reading literature on answering cults. In fact, I maintain a ministry on how to answer cults [EadsHome Ministries; www.eadshome.com]. I was glad to read this book, but found it to be difficult to read...much like reading a dictionary. In fact, this book is best thought of as a dictionary. It is a book you would pull out to read what the Tanners compiled on a particular subject, but it isn't a book that many people would just sit down to read. I would NOT recommend this book for someone who is new to learning about Mormonism...I would only recommend this book to someone very familiar with Mormonism and who wants a reference book from the Tanners on various subjects dealing with Mormonism"
3,Its a computerized wonderful life!,I enjoyed this book with its twists on the Charles Dickens novel A Christmas Carol. I liked the fact that Scrooge came to the 20th century to rescue a person very much like himself before the ghosts' visits. Ms.monica banks was a great character and fun to listen to. A very worthy christmas novel.
3,Ebenezer Scrooge gets to wear the other shoe.,"Story:There is a ghost in the machine at the company known as Databanks. This ghost has a plan to save his former company and his sister from the same fate that claimed him. He will have the help of a young girl and a little help from on high. He will also have the help of a very special man who had a similar experience in another time and place many years ago. Who better to help a Scrooge than the man himself?This is an interesting update to A Christmas Carol that switches out Scrooges world for more modern times and puts Old Ebenezer in control of the slide show. It's not heavy, most of the goings on are played for laughs and the ending goes as one would expect. Still its worth a look if you want to pass some time or just want a quick read. m.a.c"
3,Cocktail,I purchased this syrup for a cocktail. Does not have much raspberry taste. I would not order this again. Very very sweet.
2,Well written gibberish,I hope the author didn't spend too much time writing this book. It would have been a lot better with some semblance of coherence.
4,Just a little disappointed,"OK... I loved the Alarm. HUGE fan then and now. Great songs great live band and Mike Peters voice fits perfectly. Having said that...all those things are true with this record but something's just a tiny bit off. And it's just because the original guys aren't there other than Peters of course. The classic lineup with Peters, Eddie McDonald,Twist and Dave Sharp just had something really special. That ""it"" factor you can't put your finger exactly on. I miss those days BUT its absolutely PHENOMINAL to hear these songs live again. If you are already a fan...don't hesitate. If you're new to The Alarm maybe start with ""Strength"""
4,A surprise: Sexy unlike the Jordan we're used to.,"I just heard it on the radio for the first time tonight. I must say, I expected more of a ballad from Jordan than this type of song. Though, after hearing it twice, it's starting to catch on me. Though I don't know how I feel about those lyrics! They're much more sexy than the Jordan I'm used to! I don't know about that ""taste you"" line which is edging of vulgarity. But, I think he will finally get an audience that's a bit older than 7-years-old girls for this. And I think that will be good for him.If you're reading this Jordan, Good Job!"
1,Poor song!,The song is rather annoying to say the least. This artist underestimates his audiences' intelligence.
4,Welcome back....even without the sexy falsetto,"Despite the corny ""carnival"" intro and finish, this song speaks to the core of my reawakened inner Jordan Knight fan! But I've gotta say that I miss the falsetto that made me swoon so long ago-if you think you're going to get it again, you, too will be sadly disappointed. But it's a very seductive track, and I am welcoming Jordan back with open ears....and arms, if he'll have me! :o)"
2,he has very little talent even after all these years.,This snappy tune doesn't have much of a voice to back it up. Jordan Knight needs to hang up his musical sneakers once and for all. The world would then be a better place.
4,Jordan sounds as sexy as ever.,"The carnival music's a little weird, but Jordan still sounds as sexy as ever. Great dance song."
5,"""Give It To You"" is a HIT!!!!!!!","Jordan Knight has outdone himself!!! This new song is very sexy! His dance moves are impeccable and he has definitely improved with age! He has broken away from the image he received as a result of his career as a teen idol! I feel this song is what he should've been singing all along! This song has rythm and funk! I look forward to hearing the entire CD! Good job Jordan, you've got my vote!!!!"
4,This is so much better than anything the New Kids ever did,"The second I saw the video I realized that Jordan was still the hottie that had my 7 year old self swooning! The song is so awesome and I'm so glad its unlike any New Kids song! He's definetly come a long way and ""Give it to You"" proves it."
3,It could be so much more...,"I was disappointed the first time I heard it because I expected a whole lot more from Jordan since he has written some better stuff. and with Jordan being quite the perfectionist, I thought it would be different, more like Joey McIntyre's ""Stay The Same"" but no, it was something different. I am really hoping the album turns out to be a lot better."
1,Disappointing fluff from someone capable of a better product,"Comparing this (or not) to former new kid Joey Mcintyre, this song is a disappointment. Not to mention, trivial subject matter. Jordan Knight is capable of alot more. I hope the rest of the album isn't like that- It will be a quick return to one of those trade-in shops, if it is"
5,Jordan is as wonderful as ever,"I feel so fortunate to live in South Florida, where Jordan WILL BE performing this song LIVE THIS WEEKEND!!!! Because Miami radio has supported him so much. This Song is great and especially for fans who have stuck by him and have been eagerly awaiting the release of his new music. If you haven't heard this song yet, don't wait until the whole album comes out. It is worth buying the single just to hear his sexy voice over and over!!!!!"
3,Fair ... I guess,"Although I like this song, I feel jipped because this is the only song on this entire cd. The artist doesn't even include samples of other songs from his album. Because of this, this cd gets old almost immediately after you put it in the stereo. Nice beat, though."
5,Toddlers will love it!,"This book is a wonderful tool for those kids just beginning to explore the world of reading. Their imagination will soar with a well-balanced blend of reading, looking at picures, and sometimes even basic math like counting. A must have for parents looking for something to keep their 3-year-old away from the TV."
5,An American Hero,"Great book about Robert Rogers and the St.Francis Raid of 1759.The story closely parallels the movie ""Northwest Passage"" starring Spencer Tracy in 1940.I like the author, Stephen Brumwell and highly recommend his books. He also appears in the trilogy of F&I documentaries:When the Forest Ran Red,George Washington's First War and Pursuit of Honor.I have met him before on several occasions and he is truly a gentleman."
5,So far so good,"I love to read , & this is about old time history , it is well written & I am enjoying it, it came in a timely manner , so that always good ! Cheers :-)"
2,Sorry not for me,"Wow when reading the description of this book I thought I was in for a treat because this is a period of time that I feel I should have been born. I love the era, but this book was nothing but a bunch of dates and names of mostly French people that I could not even pronounce. It was to many to even keep up with and after awhile I just started skimming over them to see if I could get to something interesting. In a book this long there was not enough interesting things to make it worth my while. I was very dissapointed. If you are into names and dates you'll love it. It read like a bad history book to me. Sorry."
4,Quiet and works!,"I purchased this fan to replace an old noisy fan in my rental unit. The old fan would not even draw a piece of toilet paper against the vent although it still spun at full speed. The fan was easy to install, is much quieter, and actually exhausts the room for a change. Well worth the money. The only thing I did not like was the quality of the vent cover and the plastic knob used to secure it. The vent is very thin and flimsy and the knob is cheap plastic; I would have expected a bit better quality on these items considering this is a small fan in the $100 - $150 dollar range. These two issues aside I am about to purchase a second one for my own bathroom. I no longer will cheap out on bathroom exhaust fans. All the cheap units do is make noise, spend a few extra bucks and you'll be glad you did."
2,Dangerous Product Design & Noise,"Complaint -- dangerous product!I am a handyman. I bought and installed this bath fan for my own home. The wiring connection box has an access opening that is too small to work safely with -- even with my medium-sized hands. And it's too small to wire the connections using tightly fitting safety gloves. So when I wired the connections, my left palm touched the razor sharp and unfiled sheet metal edges of the fan housing, resulting in a one-inch gash on my palm. NuTone product engineers are asleep at the wheel to allow such a hazard to pass through design and production. In addition, it's not quiet despite the claims, especially when I compared it to my $40 cheapo NuTone fan in a basement bath. With this model, I found that the fan motor hums and buzzes. Maybe the design needs to incorporate rubber dampening grommets where the motor is attached to the frame. So for the price, I just may return it."
4,simple as ABC...,"I love the Eric Carle ABC, but it doesn't come in a board book - my two-year-old twin grandsons managed to rip it. So this is a board book, which is great. It's simple, just uppercase letters, and the accompanying pictures are interesting and attractive. I think it would have been better if the dimensions of the book itself were a little larger."
5,In 80s heaven,I have been looking for Teen Witch for a while now and found this double feature and it's perfect. I love it!
5,Great Buy!,I haven't watched these movies since I was a girl! It was nice to buy them together so such a great price. The came in perfect condition and are great quality!!!
5,Perfect 80's flick,Gave the movie to my best friend for her birthday. She loved it! One of her favorite movies growing up.
2,Didn't hit the right chord for me,"I found this book flat - it just didn't draw me in. Although the characters started out interesting, they just didn't develop and, cardinal sin for me, they weren't characters which generatedin sense of sympathy or empathy in me. My book club members didn't like it either so I find it surprising it is so highly rated."
1,disappointing,"This novel, while perceptive at times, is disjointed and altogether disappointing. I finished it because I had nothing else to read at the time. None of the characters grabbed me. I simply didn't care what happened to them."
3,An Ordinary Family.,"This book was not gripping in its plot, but I did enjoy the portrayal of the characters. They really came to life. The tone of this book was low-key. It was an excellent and detailed look at ordinary life in a small American town. I personally found that I was able to engage with the 'ordinary' daily lives which were the focus of this novel.There were two or three times that events seemed to ramble slowly along and I found myself wondering where this was going and what was the point. But this in a way enhansed the general tone of the book. After all, in every life the events are often unconnected and pointless.It was perhapse a reflection on the way in which people try to read significance into their lives in their efforts to stave off annonymity. There is irony in the way that the family featured in the novel place great significance on the fact of the birth of three children on the ides of the month, yet they do not end up leading particularly significant lives."
2,Couldn't pique my interest...,"I had heard good things about this book, so I picked it up at the library (fortunately). However, I was maybe 20 pages in when I couldn't take it anymore and started skimming the book. I only really read the last 30 pages or so--there seemed to be more action in those pages than in the rest of the book.I WANTED to like this book, really I did. The idea of 3 kids being born on the same day and how that influences their relationships with other people in their lives sounded cool. Lily, Robert & Warren were joined at the hip during their childhood, but I think that the amount of displeasure from various people in their formative years affected them more than anything.If you are a fan of Ms. Dew's you may enjoy this book, but I don't know that I would ever pick up anything else by her. I will say that I really liked the cover & the ambiguity of the title..."
1,"whatever happened to ""show don't tell""","If I had produced this novel for a fiction class at my local community college, I would have been sent back to remedial fiction writing ""show don't tell.""We are told throughout this book - what to think, what the characters are thinking etc etc.The plot is plodding, the whole structure is pointless - the author makes one protagonist, then another, then another until the reader is confused about who to root for...why intriduce John as a central antagonist when he's invisible for most of the story.This book is not only badly written, it's boring."
3,What Evidence?,"If you would like to read a book about life a century ago, and enjoy a slow paced novel, this is for you. I could not determine a plot to this book, and there is not much to tell except how certain friends and families interacted.When I first purchased the book I thought the title might indicate some suspense or murder mystery. However, I am hard pressed to determine what evidence and against whom?I wouldn't say reading it was a waste of time, but then again, time could have been better spent on another book."
2,BORING book!,I rarely give up on a book but this one...oh YES! The author couldn't make me care about the characters and I just shut it down and took it back to the library.
2,Stultifyingly Boring,"This books hints of things to come, but never delivers. The author sets up interesting relationships and situations, and then does nothing with them. A truly uninspired work."
3,The Evidence Against Her,"Although this book was well written and entertaining to a point, I was disappointed with it. The title implies that there is some sort of mystery involved and I kept waiting for it to happen. It was misleading, and left me feeling I'd missed something. I cared about the characters but found myself wanting a more definitive ending. I kept waiting for the characters to exhibit evidence of their dysfunctional (in most cases) homelives, but it seems to have had little influence on them at least not in the traditional sense."
2,"Carb addicts, hypoglycemics--BEWARE!","Katahn's premise that eating fat makes you fat and that anything fat-free is the ""be all, end all"" of weight loss is wrong, wrong, WRONG! First, starches and sugars are lipids that can form fat as easily as a hot poker through a chunk of lard. Second, a high carb diet such as Katahn's can trigger strong biochemical cravings for starches and sugars. Either Katahn is clueless about biochemical common knowledge, or he is a thoughtless self-promoter who could care less about the 80% of people who will probably gain weight on his diet. The only thing this diet is good for is lowering cholesterol."
4,German assaultgun unit histories,"Good book covering the use and development of the German WWII assaultgun, and its deployment and effectiveness in WWII. The Germans developed the assaultgun specifically to provide direct artillery support to German infantry from an armored vehicle. The design provided a lower silhouette AFV with better frontal armor and a larger gun then the tank chassis it was built on. It was also cheaper to make then a tank. When the short 75mm was replaced with the long 75mm in 1942 the gun's mission and use added the tank destroyer role. All of this plus a short history of each assaultgun battalion/brigade in the German army is included in this fine book. Recommended."
4,Great History!,"My boyfriend and I are reading this book on our way to dives each week. It is an easier read than ""Neutral Buoyancy, another great book on the history of diving"". Each chapter leads to the next and it is very interesting to understand how underwater exploration has evolved."
4,Pretty good read,"Very good background to better understand who all some of these folks were in the history of diving. does't go super in-depth with anyone, but covers a lot of people. good starter to then go find another book devoted to one of them by themselves."
3,it was better than the fourth one...,This was an improvement over the fourth one but I still find it lacking without Jigsaw being directly involved. I just don't care much for the detective caring on his work. The traps were improved from the last one but still not as interesting as they were in the earlier ones. It moved along at a pace that seemed slow to me and I was tempted several times just to fast forward to see what new games were instore for victims. The victims were all related through a business deal that was rather shady and they did indeed figure that out (or at least the remaining ones); but I preferred the earlier ones that weren't so blatantly related like in the first Saw movie.
4,Gorey but suspenseful....,Many folks I talk to on a regular basis say that the Saw series is not scary at all it is just sick and gross. I find this hard to believe what I think it's a suspenseful horror flick and with horror there is normally gore this is nothing new while effects were prohibitive to show the full extent of the horror in classical films it is now possible to show all and this is proof. This however may leave little for the imagination which may be bad for some but I think people are so freaked by this that they refuse to watch it. So all in all I say this series does the job in maintaining a horrific film. Some like it some hate it I just wonder how one could dream up such a twisted storyline. Good film if you are not scared of the sight of blood and gore.
4,Saw V,"I have no complaints the dvd arrived when it was supposed, packaging was not opened crushed from shippment."
2,Getting boring,"While Number one was exciting and the shocking story was full of surprises we see the quality of their storyline going down movie after movie.It looks to me like the producers want to publish as many new movies with this topic as possible to squeeze the maximum of money out of it.No problem with this if quality of story line, actors, picture techniques match to some minimum standards.Unfortunately none of them matched my expectations anymore. It looks more like a budget movie produced by some film students with very restricted Budget."
2,Saw 5 Collector's edition,Prodact him self is very good but when you push the button and you hear jigsaw voice you think at the saw will be rotated. Wrong!!! The saw is not working and what i know this is a general problem with all the boxes.I is a shame becouse this is a real collector's edition!!!!!!!!!!
2,Bring JigSaw Back!!!,I loved Saw 1-4 But five kinda sucked. Who cares about how many people helped JigSaw? Lets hope Saw 6 is better or it's curtains for this series.
2,I've Seen That Movie Too,"I'll start by admitting that I did not see Saw IV. I don't think I missed much. Saw V apparently took up where that one left off. The people involved with this franchise would like for me (and others) to somehow sympathize with whackos because they were wronged by our judicial system. They then use the flimsy premise of ""let's teach people a lesson through mutilation,"" by doling out their own form of justice. Yawn. I enjoyed the first two films; however by part 3, all I could do was shake my head. There's nothing new here--much less original. It's just the same old routine of ""let's play a game"" that involves loss of life--or at least limb. Still, this wasn't as bad as some of the films of this genre. The director did a decent enough job with lighting and sound, but Costas Mandalyor has the stage presence of a turnip."
1,"""USED"" MEANS NO ARTWORK NOR CASE","I give this TRANSACTION (read: not the movie) 1-Star. The DVD arrived in a generic clear DVD holder with a sticker ""sealing"" it closed. No artwork, no movie box, nothing - literally just the disc. There was a piece of paper with the shipment informing me that ""disc in condition as advertised"" --- you are about to order this movie from the same page I did and I don't see anything alerting me to the aforementioned. In fact, the picture shows the disc AND artwork, so why wouldn't I be surprised to find this generic case?! Correct me if I am wrong, but ""used"" should mean ""watched,"" right? Where is the rest of box and booklet? If I had bought this anywhere else I would have sworn it was a duplicate or bootleg. This is our first movie purchase off amazon.com and we aren't very thrilled..."

1,"Sub Par Saw Film, yet again","I cannot say that I had high expectations when I went to the theater to see this film. The plot is boring, and uninspired, just like the past three films. They try to make the film tie up all the loose ends that they have created in the previous films but failed to do so, only confusing the viewer more. Oh well, all you can do is hope for a good slasher, and I guess thats what we got, but I can say that the first two saws had a great deal of promise. This film is pretty much the Jason X of the Saw Franchise"
3,More of a cop thriller than a horror movie.,"This saw movie was more of a detective/cop thriller than it was a horror movie. Yes there were traps as usual, but the horror feel just didn't seem like it was there. Would of been a better movie if they would of made it about a different killer, and dropped the Saw name."
4,"Great sequel,its better than the first one!","This movie is great and actually ties in the story from the other Saw films.This movie ties in so much from the others you have to watch 2,3,& 4 to have it make sense.The story continues from the last movie where Jigsaw dies and detective Hoffman continues Jigsaw's plans.Agent Strahm trys to figure out where the murders took place at and piece together what happened since the last movie.This film have centered around five people that get stuck in a series of traps and have to disable the traps before they die like the other movies.The movie starts to get good when you see Agent Strahm just figured out detective Hoffman is the killer.These movies did the opposite of the Jason and Freddy movies and actually made the sequels that top the original ones with great writing and has a twist ending,they have the best endings.I actually liked this movie better than the first one and that one is a classic!"
4,if ordering from the uk watch out,"i recently ordered this film and as usual it appears well priced and delivered resonably quickly considering i live in scotland,however im not sure who i have to thank for the 12.10p customs charge i had to pay upon it arriving at my local post office,it is a good movie but in all not worth nearly 35"
4,Good reality show!,"If you are not familiar with the saw series I would highly reccommend it. I am a fan of the entire series because of the lesson that everyone must have a weakness or bad habit that comes back to bite them eventually, unless they are strong enough to overcome it. As for Saw V, it starts off where part IV left with detective Stroum being the only person to survive after jigsaws tests. The police find Stroum barely alive and with no leads to who is responsible. Jigsaw has been dead since the the end of the part III to be involved anymore. The plot becomes a guessing game as to who has taken over jigsaws plan. For me this series is still interesting and still has relevance as long as there are people left to take the test of survival that jigsaw has given them. Four out of five."
4,Collector's Edition vs. Director's Cut?,"Having put off watching this series due to a squeamish girlfriend, a nasty cold, keeping me home from work for a few days allowed me to watch all 5 movies over the course of two days.Though not the best of the series, it did hold my interest and answer some questions about the background stories of some of the characters. Though gruesome, the ending was predictable. The charm of the SAW franchise is the unpredictable endings and I hope I can be surprised with the next installment.I'm just wondering if there is a difference between the Unrated Collector's Edition (which I own) and the Unrated Director's Cut. Amazon shows a four minute difference between the two DVD versions but this is not always the case.Does anyone know?"
3,3 1/2,"I will applaud the series for being a little more fresh after 5 installments then say Halloween/Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. That said, this series is really growing stale. With the death of Jigsaw it now falls to Hoffman to continue his work. But to utilize the popular Tobin Bell, the movie is full of flashbacks explaining how the two met, how Jigsaw trained him, and explaining a lot of what happened in the other movies. Besides the flashbacks, you have the co-stories of 5 people trapped in a jigsaw house and Hoffman being pursued by a federal agent who suspects him in the jigsaw murders. The movie seems very much like a set up for part 6, as it leaves several questions about jigsaws wife. I like the series, but I think they need to have a final episode and wrap everything up at this point."
2,Saw XXV I mean V,"Just because you come up with a few new traps does not make the Saw story worth continueing. The main man, Bell, isn't more than a faded memory and he was the one that was truly scary, not a few pieces of metal and wire or some lackey supposedly carrying on in the masters footsteps. Sorry but just like the Jason, Friday the 13th, and Halloween movies, more of the same-o same-o does not mean better. Just like them this series has reached it's plausability threshold, and anything more is just plain sawing for the sake of sawing, gore for the sake of gore. Anyone can think up ways to kill people in painful bloody ways, not everyone can use suspense to create a frightening mood rather that hack one victim up after another for the umpteenth time like mannequins senselessly marching to death. If you like to see the repetitious trapping of people and hacking them up, by all means catch Saw V. If you like suspense, catchDisturbia (Widescreen Edition).CA Luster"
4,Great Movie!,Great Movie and addition to my collectionProducers should consider to release a collection box set for such an incredible saga...
5,great movie,"You can't go wrong with SAW if you like the movies , you'll like them all and the progression of the plot is very well developped and it runs at a fast pace."
2,the directer downngrade this film to a old horror movie,scare you with a dog bark?heard lot of ghost screeming in many trapit won't make it more scarierit will just make audience want to leave the theaterbtw trap is good but is not enough to use as a Saw series's ending
2,Not one of his greatest.,Merzbow gets pretty brutal here on the ear drums at times (more than usual!) but it still has some pretty interesting moments. Not as awful as Akasha Gulva (his WORST release BEWARE!) but not as enjoyable as some of his other releases. Buy cheap sell high.
2,Blood Rayne is a OK game.,"This was the first Blood Rayne for the PS2. It has good graphics, controls, sound and music. The Graphics are low budget. The controls are a little stiff. The sound is great and so is the environments.Blood Rayne takes place during World War 2. Rayne is half human & half vampire. She has plenty of weapons to use against the evil vampires. Rayne wants revenge against her father for killing her human mother and family. She has a cool attitude and very optimistic. You can kill the enemy a number of ways. Sucking their blood, chopping off limbs with your blades, and shooting them. Plenty of moves to learn. There are boss battles along the way. Some are easy and others are plain tough.The sequel was the best between the two. Blood Rayne 2 had more moves, abilities, weapons, etc. Pick that one instead."
4,fun!,"Bloodrayne aged shockingly well. Frankly, I'm amazed that it aged as well as it did. My only problem is that it gets old after a few hours."
1,Beware of this game! NOT RECOMMENDED,"For all of the gamers...the game control is difficult to grasp. The graphics are pretty good for the most part. Gameplay is kinda of weak because of how easy it is to just take out opposing characters.Now the core of my review: This game is dark! I've played other games that some would deem pretty creepy. This game traverses the line into extreme GOTHIC. The mind from which this game spawned from is more than likely steep into the occult. I would strongly caution parents away from this game. I would urge anyone considering this game to do so with complete scrutiny. You have to be free of much moral character to appreciate a game this evil.A friend of mine had industry reviews of the game stating that Marilyn Manson had a part in the games development. CAUTION! That it and of itself should be reason to stay clear of this game.Luckily, I rented the game, thinking it held a driven story and fast-action gameplay. I played it for 10 minutes and returned it after that."
5,Blood Rayne (PS2 Video Game),Video Game arrived in excellent condition and quality. Video Game arrived in a very timely fashion.
4,Blood Rayne PS2,well when I played it it was easy and it does get harder it just grow on me slomotion is so cool you can cut off lims and heads you get a lots of guns you have two blades one on both arms you suck blood you can jump on them and suck there blood its your life your a hot chick half vampire half human eny enyway the only thing I have to say bad about it is the combos dont go together well I think it is a cool game Rent it befor u buy it!
3,Blood Rayne,"I bought this game from Amazon, and I'd say the game itself is fun, but the controls are a little awkward. The second one has a little better setup for the controls, but the first is not set up how you think it would be, so the controls are a little harder to master at first. It does have an interesting story. I would recommend it for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary."
5,BllodRayne Rules!,"I love this game!I am currently playingBloodRayne, and I loveit! I got it for Christmasand I am so glad I did! Ihave a memory card and thestrategy guide, and those weregreat investments, too. The gameplayis great, the weapon choices, well youcan't go wrong with those. Also, you getto be half-vampire, and feed on your enemies,that's the best! It seems this game is aimedtowards guys, but I am a GIRL and I love it!If you love vampires-especially a great one likeRayne-then this is the game for you!"
4,Great game,"Okay, Bloodrayne? Awesome..You can't go wrong with this one. Awesome storyline and the gameplay is fantastic.. The look and feel of the game is phenomenal..The only thing that could be improved is the graphics and maybe the acting... But there is also some max Payne type things thrown in there which there is absolutley no problem in that..The game is a bit too easy.. you might want to put it on a challenging level..before you beat it.. I Highly recommend this one though..."
2,"Boring, repetitious game","This game, in my mind, looked great. When I bought it, it looked like a Resident-Evil type of game featuring a vampire. Well, I was wrong. It is a boring game. There isn't too much excitement, aside from the beginning of the game. It's all the same thing, over and over. Kill kill, shoot shoot, kill shoot kill. Not really that much fun, in my opinion.If you want a scary, fun, intelligent game, try Resident Evil. Any of the Resident Evils."
2,Poorly made game,When I first read about this game I thought it would be a lot of fun to play because I like horror/adventure games. Then Istarted to play and the dissappointment set in. First of all graphics are one of the most important aspects of this type ofgame and BloodRayne comes up short in the graphics department.The graphics lack detail and they are full of tiny glitches that detract from the game. A good story might have helped butBloodRayne doesn't even have that. I think BloodRayne had the potential to be a good game but low quality graphics and a poor story make it a bad. Spend your mfoney on something else.
3,Really tight vampire game,"This game is pretty cool if you're a fan of vampires. I'm one of them, OBSEST with them almost. This game is really cool, Rayne kicks butt! All the variety of weapons and moves. It's one game you definattly don't want to play at night in a dark room if you're weak at heart and scare easily. Hehe i can be at times. This game has a gothic look too it which makes it so cool. Love the voices, specially since two are the voice actors of my favorite anime Dragonball Z. It's a definite buy as i've said if you're into vampires and blood and gore and all that good stuff in video games. I rated it three stars for the moment cause I just got it and haven't got used to the controls and way of moving just yet. This game kicks [butt]!!"
2,wow this...!,I am a pretty big gamer. So i would like to think i am not blowing smoke but this game just did not cut it. Mabey 2 or 3 years ago this game would be cool but for a PS2 game the graphics where so so and the game flow... You would be better off spending your money somewhere else.
3,A game,"I was one of the lucky ones..I didn't have to shell out the money to try this one since my girlfriend bought it for me for Christmas...I wouldn't have gotten it...not without trying it out first. The game. It's not terrible. There are certainly worse games out there, because it definitely has it's moments. I think the most disappointing features of this game are with the graphics, which are very inconsistent. Some areas are done well enough, others seem like they were an afterthought. Rayne herself was renedered beautifully..but some of her movements are very choppy and don't flow together. The exception to this is when you are in Blood Rage..which when done at times when you are hacking countless enemies has some cool effects. Besides the graphics another problem is the forced sexuality..namely close ups of breasts jigglying oddly and at odd times...sometimes seemingly for no reason.this game is a definite try before your buy."
5,Go Blood Rayne!,"This videogame is the best! It looksso real! Rayne is half vampire half woman.It has cool things like 3-D graphics. Get this game.But before I go, if parents are seeing this rewiew, pleasedo not buy this game if your child is under 17."
4,Rayne Of Blood Has Just Started,"When I first bought this game I tought it was gonna be like the DMC series, but then I played and got surprised how the grapics were like,this game is about a girl who was apprehended in europe after carving a path of destruction trying to track down and kill her biological father.The girl's name you know it and she claimed the people she killed, and it all start from here.The game got revolutionary control:target multiple enemies with each hand simultaneously.Special abilities:suck blood for healt.Use slo-mo,zoom and aura visions.Fantastic acrobatic moves bend the enviroment to your will.Battle nazis,mutants,swamp creatures, and ancient parasitic monsters"
4,"Both ""Human clay"" albums on a 2 CD set.","""Human Clay"" was a project put together by ""Talisman's"" core Jeff Scott Sotto and Marcel Jacob. This package includes their only two albums along with additional bonus tracks. In these albums vocals are done by JSS, guitars and bass by Marcel Jacob and drums by ""Talisman"" guest Jamie Borger.The evidence above would suggest this being a second rate ""Talisman"" we are talking about. It is not the case; free from deadlines and label restrictions, at the time, the guys manage to deliver solid songwriting and outstanding performance (even with the rhythm guitar parts and solos). At parts the music flaws so naturally that it surpasses ""Talisman"" (unbelievable but true). The only let down in this case, especially with the first album, is the production. Sure mixing and mastering is clean and clear but it seems as the drum sound did not come out as expected from a hard rock band."
5,Great book!,I was very happy with my purchase. I actually received it in a few days. My son enjoyed the book very much.Thank you
1,Many problems with his references,"Mr. Ginenthal gave us a lot of evidences, why Velikovsky is right and Cral sagan and his followers must be wrong. But he made some serious mistakes. Maybe he should read his references again. Sometimes he takes them out of context completely. Others were contradicting his thesis, but nevertheless he takes them to suport his ideas.Just for example the deep-earthquakes. G. is quoting Frohlich, Scientific American Vol.260, pp.48 as evidence for deep crustal quakes. But he does not even mention the explanation, Frohlich gave for these quakes. There are many more examples. I expected much more facts, but this book seems not to be scientific to me."
1,This Book Says More About Its Advocates,"This book reads more like a Discover bugga-boo ufo visitation ""documentary"" than a serious work of investigative journalism. The science is shifty and sometimes downright incorrect or outdated or taken out of context. The prose is poorly written, taking more rhetorical pointers from Watchtower pamphlets than from, say, Gleick. Ginenthal clearly had a point-of-view before writing the book and the things he excludes is more revealing than what he includes. The impression with which I am left is that those who side with Velikovsky will pick up this book, and those who read only Sagan will be left thinking V was an ill-meaning idiot. If anything, this book just goes to show that those who proclaim that it is a verdict against science or Sagan choose their books according to their views, irrespective of the quality therein, and not based on quality writing, investigating, or balanced presentation."
1,"""A Candidate for worst book ever written""","In only a thousand words??! How could anyone describe how bad this book is in a thousand words? The author starts out to prove that Sagan was wrong and ends up proving that he was right. This is about as bad as pseudoscience gets. I started off willing to be objective, but I started laughing after page eleven. Don't buy this book; it's simply silly and often so bad that I have to think the author meant to lie and cheat."
1,I am a Puzzle game fan Ehhhhhh?,"I am a puzzle game fan (Collapse, Luxor, 7 wonders). But this one? Couldn't figure it out!! Read the manual and it did not explain much. El STEEEENKO!!! Cutzy character R a plus. Sucker for cutzy."
4,"upbeat, positive house tune!","This is the type of song that stays in your head, and you dont mind! A funky bit of housey vibe, strong vocals, comparible to a more breezy Eclipe's 'Make me Love You', this is a perfect summery track to have in on a lazy humid saturday. Crisp, refreshing, simple. Great tune."
4,Seems to work,"As mentioned by another reviewer, the OS X driver on the website doesn't install due to a preflight error, but the driver on the CD does.(which is strange since the shell scripts are identical but whatevs)I got this since I was experiencing corruption with a JMB360 eSATA adapter I got so I needed to start troubleshooting.The symptom was when I copied files over dozens of bytes in various places would be different for each file, starting at around 2MB or so.Q&D; tests tonight on 3 files indicate no byte errors on copies, so provisionally this card is OK."
3,Sojurn Volume 2,So-so artwork and the same for the voice work. Not nearly as well done or as much fun as Iron Man Extremis Motion Comic.
1,How many tools do I get?,"STOP. If you are a visual shopper who sometimes brings home skim milk or Lite beer by accident, look out. Is it just me, or does amazon display a full set of tools here when in fact only one tool is described, i.e. a 3/4 inch gouge above? You had better make sure what you are buying before you trust that picture. If they change the picture and not my review, still be on the lookout for this kind of mistake."
3,"Same Letters, Just in a Different Book Style","I have many Becky Higgins lettering books, so when I saw this one, I was excited for some new letting techniques. I was disappointed that these letters were for the most part, repeats of her other books. The binding and sizing are the only things different, so for this reason I was disappointed. This more compact sizing does fit nicely in a purse, backpack, or travel bag though.I recommend the book if you do not have her others because she offers fun, interesting lettering styles. However, if like me, you already own her other works, you may want to pass on this one."
3,"Fine, but Better for Kids","I like lettering books for scrapbooking and cardmaking, so I ordered this and the second Letter Art book. It's cute and has a couple ideas that I will use, but I think they are better suited for kids or teenagers."
4,FANTASTIC for kids and adults,"TAZ is by far our families favorite game for the PS2. We received the PS2 for Christmas along with several games. Having no experience with gaming we found some of the games quite frustrating. My two children (4 & 7) would play for a short time then get bored as their character would die and they would have to start over or they just couldn't figure out what to do. With TAZ however, they got the hang of the controls within minutes and were spinning their way around the game for hours. The best part, TAZ NEVER DIES. This is not to say there is no challange. On the contratry, the game is challenging for both my children as well as myself and husband. For my 4 year old, the challange is just spinning around and exploring without getting caught or falling in the water. My 7 year old is more challanged by finding the wanted posters.ALL IN ALL - A GREAT FAMILY GAME FOR ALL AGES. I highly recommend this game to parents with young children.Another benefit - no violence."
5,DELICIOUS!,The cherimoyas I ordered and received this week (VERY fast delivery!) are just starting to ripen and one was ripe enough to eat... we just devoured it... juicy and absolutely delicious. Feels like we are in the tropics with this extoic fruit and the sunny weather here in California! Can't wait to eat another. YUM! I highly recommend them right now as they are perfect.
2,not worth it,"Melissa, I'm sorry, but the Cherimoyas were not at all what I expected! I had read that they were like the ""custard fruit"", but these were hard, very crunchy, with basically no taste at all. I got 5 fruits (in very good time, I will add), ate one of them all the way so I could give it a fair chance, and wound up throwing the rest away a few days later. Thirty some dollars in the trash."
1,hamilton beach air purifier,Don't try to buy a replacement filter for this unit as you won't find one anywhere on the internet. It gets dirty real quick and I don't know how they can claim a lifetime warranty. How can I clean my air with a dirty filter I can't replace or clean..you tell me!!!
1,A Childish Management Book,A marketing high-concept for sure but I found the dynamics of an upsized family irrelevant to downsized corporate structures in this prime example of vanity press.
2,Shadow of the Censor,"This is an oddity - a low-budget supernatural western with a pretty good cast, an an eye for wintry landscapes and, most remarkably, a genuinely spooky atmosphere. Unfortunately, the direction and editing are woeful, particularly in the earlier Civi War battle scenes, and after the long climb up Demon Mountain, there's a real sense of anti-climax. The journey is not helped by this Synergy DVD version, which is technically risible, a dodgy video recording transferred to the digital medium with the usual high degree of sound and picture degradation. Making matters worse are the holes where 'bad' language has been excised and, more damaging still, the blood and gore has been less than surgically removed, which may explain why this version runs for 90 minutes while the original print was 114."
5,I love this band,"""Mirage"" was a risk for me. I'm cautious about the music I buy, and I had never heard of Camel before purchasing ""Mirage"". This band deserves to be better known, I was spellbound by Mirage's entrancing melodies.Now I have ""The Snow Goose"", equally deserving of Mirage's greatness. Camel is a band that can create just as much feeling as a band centered around a vocalist, displaying this ability superbly in ""The Snow Goose"". I get absorbed into Camel's compositions with every listen, I can't wait to hear ""MoonMadness"", Mirage's supposed close counter-part."
1,This is a worthless book on Radiant Floor Heating,This book is totally worthless if you are hoping to understand and design the control systems for radiant floor heating. I wish I could get my money back. The book description by the publisher and the Editorial Reviews are misleading at best. I wish there had been a buyer review at the time I placed my order with Amazon--I would have passed on this book. Avoid.
1,Too basic to be of use,"I was very disappointed in this book. It says right on the front cover that it's ""A Contractor's easy guide to hydronic Controls, Wiring, and Wiring Diagrams"". If a contractor needs to refer to this basic of information, I don't think I want them working in my house. I learned everthing in this book in High School. Don't waste your time unless you have no idea about how electricity works"
1,way too simple,"This book is far too basic. Almost all of the book isabout very simple electrical concepts; the ""hydroniccontrols"" portions are only examples of these generalconcepts. I was greatly disappointed with the book --most manufacturer's web sites have much better andmore understandable descriptions."
1,Hydronics Controls Book Review,Book is very simplistic - seems like it's intended audience is for people who don't know which end of a screwdriver to use. Waste of money IMHO.
1,A little too basic,This book would make a good school book to show kids the basics of electrical circuits.It unfortunately is based on obsolete technology for the hydronic controls and has no controls for heat pumps. It's based around boilers etc.
2,Simple and likely a waste of time,"If you can wire a front and back doorbell with a transformer then you don't need this book to tell you how to wire hydronic controls. The control panels themselves will give you the same information in their installation notes and on the inside cover of the panel if you have lost the installation notes or can't find them online (as if). If you can't follow those instructions, you shouldn't be diddling with these things anyway."
3,background knowledge needed,This book is good if you have basic hydronic knowledge and intend to implement systems. Not for the beginner.
4,Great just old,The choreography is great the fight scenes awesome and the sick style of lungful was cool. The leading man though is forgettable and a little annoying I watch it for the Kung fu and the old drunken master
4,Classic Kung-Fu Goodness,"Saw this as a kid growing up and it's one of the few lesser known films that stuck with me. like ""Tai Chi Master"" aka ""Born Invincable"" I have had multiple copies of this on VHS only to lose them or lend them out and neevr get them back. I loved this flick back in the day and still do. Awesome fight scene in the Wine house between Sam Seed and Rubber Legs. And the Drunken mantis style is just sick! If you're a classic Shaw Bros lover, get this film!"
3,Very tasteful,"This was originally issued in 1975, on Black Lion Records, as The Talk of The Town, featuring just SG and Alan Clare on piano, performing (mostly) beautifully restrained arrangements of ten songs, amongst them many old favourites such as Stardust, Nature Boy, Greensleeves and, of course, the title track. Late at night, it really is lovely, having been recorded at Anvil Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire by Eric Tomlinson and Michael Hook and produced by Alan Bates.Finding it on CD took a bit of doing, but eventually amazon's system traced the title track to this reissue, on which the track order is quite different from the original vinyl release, augmented by three additional tracks (of no particular note) featuring Earl Hines on piano.The original (and, for me, correct) track order is 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5. Not amazing, but well worth a look."
4,A great noseless seat!,"After having experimented with several other noseless seats this summer, this one was by far the best. While removing the nose and alleviating pressure in the perineum any seat setup will invariably divert that pressure somewhere else. Most likely people feel it more in their hands, wrists, or shoulders. If you can deal with a little more force there it will be well worth it. What this seat does well is keep the depth(front to back) small enough so as to not bother the upper thighs. Just did a week of riding 20+ miles a day and was more comfortable than I've ever been before on a bike."
1,Tiny and Uncofmortable!,"So to set the record straight, my posterior is quite bony and lacking so that may have contributed to many of my issues with this seat. With that said, I expected this thing to be MUCH wider / bigger .. almost like a cruiser seat but to my surprise.. this was way smaller than your average bicycle seat with horn !I put it on my hybrid style commuter bike and rode a few miles with it.. and it really REALLY hurt... extremely uncomfortable on my 'sit bones' and while I didn't feel nearly as much pressure in the 'taint' area, I felt far more than they advertised.I returned this seat for a full refund and went to my local big box store and got a cruiser seat for $20... much happier!Amazon was pretty great with the shipping/return policy , no complaints there!"
1,Probably not as uncomfortable as a seat in Abu Ghraib but pretty close.,"I replaced my Schwinn seat with the Ergo ""most comfortable seat"". This seat is even more uncomfortable than my Schwinn seat. I don't know nor understand who's writing all these positive reviews about this torturous seat. My advice is don't waste your money. If you want one, you can have mine free/no charge. Then pass it on to someone else to try.It's probably less painful than water-boarding. I haven't ever been water boarded. It is definitely NOT the most comfortable seat. The clue I missed is that it would/could take some time i.e. weeks to get used to it. In my opinion a better description would be to become inured to it. Thanks but no thanks. Anything that's advertised as requiring weeks to get used to is not a good sign. I'll keep looking for a replacement.Al Staniulis"
5,"Great comfortable seat, worked as promised","I bought this seat to relieve pressure points that were causing numbness on my current seat. Worked great, it was smaller than i thought fromt he pictures, but that is actually a good thing. Getting seat angle and height adjusted just right made the seat go from good to great (and those are individual factors more than properties of this seat, though the adjustment was not one for one with my old seat). The lack of nose didnt seem to affect balance or steering (which is the only reason ive been given for why the seat needs the nose in the first place).I will be buying more of these in the spring for the rest of the family to ride on."
2,Not great,"It definitely solves most of the problems that come from having a stick between your legs. However, it's not very comfortable either. The front corners keep ramming into my legs and butt. It also has a weird protrusion in the center that still hits the... 'taint' rather frequently. I ride a mountain bike, btw. I have stuck with it for about a month now, and that doesn't seem to help. I don't think it's a matter of me getting used to it, I think it just has those defects. If you are concerned about the ovrall width, it has about 8in of comfortable sitting space. I would recommend trying something else if you are serious about eliminating the pressure from your genitals.For the designers, I would take a seat that is already known to be comfortable, and just cut out the nose somehow. Most good nosed seats nowadays have a gap in the center for relieving the pressure, and an extra bulge at the back for comfort. This one just seems outdated."
3,Ergo seat,Forces you to lean forward more so harder on your wrists. Allowed me to attach a baby seat between me and the handle bars so my kid can be forward facing but the seat will take some getting used to.
2,Lacking mounting apparatus,I bought this seat after my wife seemed happy with her Schwinn seat with the same basic design. When I opened the box the seat did not have the mounting bracket that fits over the seat post. I suppose they want me to take my Trek seat apart and hope the brackets on that seat fit this seat. Schwinn provides this bracket already on the seat so I am sending this seat back and getting a Schwinn seat. I also realize I could probably buy a bracket.
3,One Time Wear,My girl was half walking/half crawling so these only lasted one day. I think if she were only walking these would have lasted longer.
3,Cute comfy shoes!,"Bought this shoes for my 13 month old, and they are great, I normally buy him stride rite or clarks, but wanted to try a cheaper brand since they grow out of them so quickly...good shoe, comfy and soft and he seems to handle them as well as the other brands"
3,"Great smell, okay cleaning factor","First and foremost, the image shown is the juice perfume, the shower gel is actually more of a ... nyquil green, honestly. It smells pretty good when you wash with it, but the problem is that it feels like it leaves a bit of residue behind. This might just be me, but I dunno. I like to feel especially clean after I shower, and this really wasn't cutting it."
4,A great find,"I had never heard of Lonnie Johnson until a week ago, when KJAZZ posted a link to a performance on YouTube on their FaceBook page. I liked how ""clean"" his singing and playing style is (was), real easy to listen to, and I wanted to add him to my play list, so I bought this cd ... mainly because of the price, but it is lovely.The liner notes from the CD said that Lonnie played with greats like Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong ... and in the lean years, he was a janitor at a Philadelphia hotel .... and then he would get another gig ... and then back to the hotel as a janitor ... and then back on the road... then back as a janitor ... wow!"
2,Smells like Coffee?,"Does NOT smell like coffee. In fact it smelled like burnt beans for a couple of days, then had NO smell at all. And ours had some kind of ""gooey"" spots on the side where the plastic either wasn't completed, or they were suppose to be somekind of venting... either way, it was kind of gross.I can't believe I paid that much money for such shoddy product.My Bad."
5,great snack size,These are a great size for meetings. When we switched to the larger 1.5oz bags fewer people ate them but we switched back and people eat them up.
2,This can't compare to Crimson Skies,"Very disappointed in this game. Artificial intelligent (AI) of planes is abysmal, view system is lousy. Graphics for the story line uses comic book looking pictures instead of animations like the old Crimson Skies did, which was a lot more fun and interesting. Not much to say about this, I played it a few days and resold it on Amazon."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"Blazing Angels 2 looked like it would be a great game.It installed just fine, it auto updated to the latest patch just fine... But when I tried to run Blazing Angels 2 I found out it will not work on a Window 7 machine and it will not work with my GTX260 graphic cards.I checked UBI support and they said it will not work in any compatibility mode either. I wish I would have know this before buying it!!"
3,"Nice game, nice graphics...",This is a good sequel to the original but at 7GB to load it takes forever to start and does not allow you to change controllers very easy. I tried to use a Wingman throttle joystick and it will not recognize it. I am using the mouse/keyboard combo and it is a bit shaky.
1,Didn't work,This product when you download needs an update but you can't get it sooooo you can't play it. My Antivirus software says it is dangerous to get the download. Don't waist you time with it.
1,blazing angles review,"The game looks good but will not play on my computer. Apparently, my video card a G-force 5200 is not good enough. So I can't really rate the game."
5,Outstanding!,"An excellent book in a very large format, of which the contents are as thorough as can be. The impressive number of photographs are a real boon. The only problem I have with the book is it may wear you out reading it, due to size and especially weight. A highly prized book in the collection. Well worth the cash laid out."
4,Good book but with one slight flaw.,"I have wanted this book for months before I actually was able to buy it. The book is very good with a lot of information on Peiper's strategy and time as commander of the blowtorch battalion and his time as a panzer commander. This book also shows you what the men who served with peiper thought of him. Filled with over 700 photos this book is well worth the price but I have one bad thing to say about this book. I was very interested in Peipers kids and his wife. I also wanted to know how his children felt with there father away at war then in prison. The book tells us very little about both of those subjects and it has only four photos of his children and none of Peiper and Sigurd getting married. All in all I did like the book. I heard that another book on Peiper is coming out, that's hope it will offer more on his family."
4,"Very Comprehensive, But Pricey","This is by far the most comprehensive biography of Jochen Peiper I've ever seen. Whether you consider him to be just a soldier doing his duty or the ""Butcher of Malmedy"" you won't find anything better than this. This book covers his entire career from a company commander to his murder by French communists when he was paroled from Landsberg prison.The only problem I have with this book is its price. I feel $95 is a bit much for a 600+ page book which is crammed with over 800 photographs, but I got it as a present so this really wasn't a concern for me. =) As comprehensive as it is, and with probably every photograph of Jochen Peiper in it, I just can't give it 5 start because of that price tag. But if you are a serious student of Jochen Peiper or even the SS in general, this book is certainly worth picking up."
5,Waffen SS at its best,"This is arguably the best book on Peiper, and also sheds light on the unconventional way of things getting done in the LAH. Compare this book to another offering from J.J. Fedorowitz, i.e. History of the Panzerkorps Grossdeutschland, then you see the differences in the panzer tactics between the premier divisions of the Heer and the Waffen SS. Whereas in the LAH the commander of the Panzerregiemnt is the de facto commnder of the division's Panzertruppe (the Panzer Regiment, the SPW Battailon, the gep. Panzer Artillerie Abtelung, plus the Panzer Aufklarungs Abteilung) and hence the assets were alwasy deployed for a schwerepunkt, in the GD the panzers were distributed amongst the infanterie as support, hence I believe the vast differences, in terms of success and tactics between the LAH and the GD. Moreover, this is one of the best books ever on one of the most charming Waffen SS officers. Worths every penny."
5,Historical value for money,"Great book on one of the most famous panzer commanders in history. Gives detailed insight on events from the ""other"" side e.g. the infamous incident in Malmedy. Judge for yourself. Good historical value. Also very usefull for modeler's purposes (e.g. dioramas)"
1,Flawed Revisionist Biography,"This book does give the most complete information yet available on Waffen SS panzer hero Jochen Peiper. Unfortunately, it is also a severely unbalanced account. No where is the version of the Malmedy massacre survivors given any credence. Peiper's witness of some of the first gassing experiments doesn't appear anywhere and his superior, Heinrich Himmler, is described as ""a misunderstood figure in history..."" Get the picture? SS expurgation. Yes, this is a good account of Peiper's career, but to get at least a little perspective, take a look at Richard Breitman's book on Himmler: Architect of Genocide. The references to Peiper will give you a clue about the side of Peiper not described... And for a balanced description of the massacre proper, see John Bauserman's detailed book on the incident. Mike Reynold's ""The Devil's Adjutant"" also strikes a better balance... Of course if you are interested in unvarnished Waffen SS hero worship with great pictures, look no further."
3,Decent,"It was an okay notebook. They give you stickers at the beginning to label, but they are kind of small. Pages were kind of thin and easy to rip. Not the worst notebook I've seen."
5,Comic-fastic!,"This program is extremely easy to use. The results are professional. I made a comic book for a client, which he bought upon seeing it!"
1,"If this is the Delux version, how bad is the regular version?","What a great idea for a product; what a pity Freeverse bungled everything. Comic Life doesn't do much, and what it does is difficult to figure out. Also, there's this problem that the product tends not to work. (Just try to grab the little corner icon. I dare you.) Comic Life supplies basic comic books panels, a few balloons and a single comic book font. And that is it!!!! No art or help creating comics - nothing. The single star is for the basic idea. A MAJOR disappointment!!!!"
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!,"....It is non-stop, tears in your eyes, laughter. Anyone who loves Marty......this is a must have, and the cream of the crop. Too bad there was no Jiminy Glick back in those days!!! Get the gumdrops , and get ready to fall off your rocker."
2,Dated Owner's Manual,Unfortunately this is not the best format to get up to date information on this subject. I suspected this but still bought the book. It read a lot like the owner's manual that came with my smartphone. Some the recommended links didn't work. I found a lot more useful information in current magazines or online forums.
4,Great Value for the Price,"These are great! I am overhauling my bag so that I have more weapons as I get close to the green. Not as good as my Ping G2 wedge, but to get 3 wedges for under $40 is awesome. Still really good feel from them and good strike on the ball. Looking forward to some lower scoring games."
4,Wedges,Like using the 56 degree and 52 degree wedges. Have shown so far more valuable to my set of clubs that I thought they were. And the price was not bad either.
3,Wedge Set,"The clubs are fine. The ""Gun Metal"" wore off fast with use... it's just a coating. But there is nothing wrong with the set, and I use it to practice all the time."
2,Lasted two rounds,"I wanted to believe a 20 dollar club would work, especially considering how rarely a 64 wedge is used. On my 2nd round with it, which was 8 swings total, the shaft snapped in half. Upon inspecting it, I can't believe these clubs even stay togther. The wall thickness of the shaft is absurdly thin. Time for me to buy a real wedge."
5,The Good Red Road,An great book anyone interested in Indi'n life and their beliefs will love this book. I am from the author's home town and what is writen is real and true.
4,"A beautiful book, but how much do I actually use it",I am an intermediate level painter. I appreciate the technique and artistry that goes into the paintings in this book. I also study them and read the artists comments and recomendations. They are sometimes vague and it is more of a read than a workshop book. I do not use it nearly as much as I hoped I would. This book does contain very impressive work and I would like to apply some of what I see to my own art.
1,There has got to be better books out there,"While the theory behind a personalize book by a frequent visitor to Conzumel and Cancun is appealing, this book falls short (at least in its Cancun portion). We recently visited Cancun and found this book to be significantly lacking in detail and many of their comments, concerning resturants and activities, we strongly disagreed with. Stick with a Fodor's book!"
5,This book delivers what is promises,"(From Planeta.com Journal) This is a recommended title, by the Conords whose Adventure Guide to the Yucatan is a favorite. Descriptions are lively and the info first-rate."
3,"informational, not geared for economical travelers","good humor style, not enough pictures. The authors skipped Akumal and environs. No mention of related sites like Chetumal and Merida. Not enough tips to help larger families save more money. Not enough lower end priced restaurants. The book is geared toward single travelers where money is not an object, or tour packages. Major disappointment: Akumal, Puerto Aventuras, Aventuras Akumal were all left out."
3,solid wood?,"Not. made of solid wood, then described as hollow-core?Good for now, time will tell if they last. Very light weight. Easy assembly, except (of course) for the last one. Remember it is hollow, do not push in the wooden pins too far, they will not come out and will rattle around inside. Luckily the wood screws they give you seem to be good enough to hold together. Great size for albums. Just wish it was real wood."
3,Relatively Simple to Assemble,"I liked the look of this item to store my albums in. It held a lot! Putting it together was relatively easy, but it feels a bit delicate. I had left over screw covers that I couldn't actually use. I couldn't get them on the screws. I feel like the instructions were not detailed enough when it came to what you were meant to do with the screw covers. I think it is attractive and relatively good value for the money."
3,"Great size for vinyls, but made CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEP","Got 3 of them. Perfect for my vinyls. Easy to build - takes like 2 minutes to build each one, but...Made VERY VERY CHEEEEEEEEEP. Just have it for half a day, and already there are some problems with that formika (or whatever it is there). You are getting what you are paying for I guess."
1,cheaply made,"Overpriced for a very cheaply made product. The color is darker than ""honey"". After building it, I decided it was easier to keep but it is definitely low quality."
1,JUNK,"This stuff is very flimsy. It came damaged and probably would have not held up for long had I not returned it. For what it cost, I would have expected something sturdier!!! Know what you're paying for . . . Do not expect too much from this product!"
3,not too sturdy but good for it's purpose,I had this item for only a week when it needed to be moved so that I could install new floors. When the workmen picked it up (full of toys) the side just shredded. Great item if you don't have to move it.
3,You get what you pay for...,"PROS:*Its cheaper then what is out there for vinyl storage/ cabinets*Easy to build*Holds vinyls well*Sturdy enough to hold my record playerCONS:*It is cheap ""wood""*When I pealed of the stickers, it pealed and damaged the surface*Not easy to attach second and third tiers, for instance One of the screws would not drill down all the way (hole striped) and when I attached Second tier, there is a crack between the two cabinets, also when attaching the second tier, the back cracked because there are no pre-drilled holes*not sure if the attached second tier is very sturdyOverall, you get what you paid for. I give it a 3.5 rating. Its enough for now and it is too much trouble to send it back. It's better then my vinyls on the floor. However, I would not use this shelf for heavy books. Also, if you care honey color, is darker then honey."
4,So far so good!,"We purchased this to place under another bookshelf to give it some height so that we could protect the 3 y/o's Dr Seuss books from the 1 y/o's chewing and tearing. So far so good - nothing to complain about.Easy to assemble, decent color, extremely lightweight."
5,Hot Flashes,This is the best over the counter product for hot flashes I have found. I was having flashes about every 15 minutes and now only have 3 or 4 a day. An amazing difference. One other benefit is only one tablet a day instead of the 3 and 4 of other products.
2,"Strictly an entry level mandolin, but not a bad one.","I bought this mandolin (but not from Amazon) for about seventy dollars, including the shipment, from an eBay auction house. It has a bright tone, but not a particularly resonant one. The intonation and bridge height required adjustment (and the bridge /is/ adjustable), but other than that it played well out of the box, without needing to adjust the action at the nut. The gig bag is barely adequate ... no padding, a weak zipper, no pockets.My only real beef with this was with the packaging ... although the box showed an instrument with a truss rod cover, and the instrument came with an allen wrench for adjusting a truss rod, the mando in the box had no truss rod. So, in a way, I felt that I didn't get what I ordered. But for $70, I felt I got my money's worth.It's still on the string set I got with it, but I'm keen to see whether putting a decent set of strings on it will make much of a difference."
5,The Louie Bellson Explosion,"How can Bellson go wrong with soloists like Don Menza & Pete Christlieb on tenor, Dick Spencer on alto and Cat Anderson on trumpet?Once again, Don Menza writes a real ""groover"" in ""Groove Blues"". The saxi soli (prior to the solo passages) is again written in the classic Menza style.""La Banda Grande"" is a real mover for both Christlieb and Menza. And Menza closes it out with another one of his fiery solos.Strayhorn's ""Intimacy of the Blues"" shuffles off with Cat Anderson's screeching trumpet. More great solo work by Menza.""Beyond Category"" is a showpiece for Bellson, who has always been able to put togther top talent in the soloist chairs of his bands. One of Bellson's best bands."
2,Not quite what I'm looking for but not bad ...................,"I'm looking for more Louie Bellson after discovering a swinging track by him called ""Blue Invasion"". This is a bit more ""big band"" than I prefer.You can hear the full version of ""Blue Invasion"" on YouTube. And if you want to buy it - search ""Bellson Jam"" here to find the cd or mp3s (and samples). I have to warn you though - I bought the cd, but ""Blue Invasion"" is the only track I would buy it for. But I'm not disappointed because I value the higher audio quality of the cd for this outstanding track."
5,old shell plates were obsoleted back in 2009,The changeover to the new shell plate which has the grove machined into it on the underside was put into production back in 2009. There are NO old style shell plates being sold by genuine Hornady dealers. I see the old ones being sold on Ebay but anyone with half an ounce of brains should steer clear of Ebay for reloading gear. Buy from a reputable dealer (like Amazon group) who keeps fresh stock.The new style shell plate is backward compatible with the old LNL AP machines but the old shell plates only work with old style AP machines.
2,How can you call it red ?,"I purchased this boombox for my 8 yr. old son for his birthday because it said it was red. Red is my son's favorite color. When the boombox came it definitely was not red,it was hot pink! Needless to say, I returned it. We have since purchased the green boombox from GPX,which he loves! I gave it 2 stars because it is a fun little gadget for kids but if you're looking for red, this is not it."
1,Yet Another Shoot-Up,"This is a dreadful movie; low production values, mediocre editing and turgid writing. Why did I buy it and enjoy it? It took place in my home town of Riverside, CA and a bunch of friends from my old karate club had parts as thugs in the movie. I doubt anyone who does not share my local interest would find this movie worthwhile."
1,Bad Analogies Equals Bad Scholarship,"Following the lead of Wylie Sypher, Miss Haigney allows the blind to lead the blind. It is precisely this type of forced analogy that has given interdisciplinary studies a bad name. What next? Walt Whitman and Cubism? Avoid this book. Buy a copy of ""The Leaves of Grass"" and let Whitman's poetry speak for itself."
5,Whitburn has done it again,"Joel Whitburn has been America's chart chronicler for thirty years now-The new edition of ""Pop Annual"" is great-Not only does it list every single that charted in Billboard magazine's ""Hot 100"" from 1955-1999,but Whitburn has a year by year Time Capsule,which gives the reader an overview of world & national events,sports,& entertainment-If you're a radio personality or just a music geek,like myself,this book deserves a worthy place in your bookcase."
2,Repetitive,"This is a very difficult read. It repeats itself over and over and over and over again. The same information can be had in other, easier to read books. Moreover, I'm not sure how realistic the advice is for most mothers - it advocates feeding twins on demand - up to 30 minutes at each feeding and separately if that is how it works out. If my expectant twins are anything like my 1st child who nursed on demand about every 1.5 hours, that would leave me only 30 min. between each feeding - toss in changing diapers & putting down to sleep and I wouldn't have time to leave the nursery."
5,Very helpful and encouraging,"This book is full of encouragement and information. When everyone is telling you it's too hard to breastfeed twins, this book tells you that you can, you should, and practical tips on how to. I found it extremely helpful."
3,Skip it if you've BF before,"I was looking for more tips about raising twins. This is a great book IF you've not breastfeed before. If you have, you'll get more from DR.Luke's book about your pregnancy & the web about after wards from good boards. Still looking for a good book about how to handle two at once."
1,This is book is pure propaganda.,"If I was unsure about breastfeeding I would not have bought this book. I would have bought a book titled ""Should I breastfeed?"" or the ""Benefits of Breastfeeding."" This book spends 1/2 of every paragraph spouting off about why breast milk is better for your baby, and if you baby does not get breast milk then their immune system will be shot for life, and if your baby gets a bottle nipple or pacificer then your baby will have this problem when it gets older.I wanted a book that would help me figure out how to breastfeed two babies at once. I wanted time management, tips, and techniques. This book inlcudes that but to find it you have to sift through all the breast milk is better propoganda.A much better book for mother's expecting twins is ""When you're expecting twins, triplets, or quads"" by Dr. Barbara Luke.The author of Mothering Multiples had her twins 20 years ago!!"
2,Minimally interesting/helpful,This book was not as good as some others I read. And it was obviously geared a lot towards brestfeeding.
4,Don't be afraid,"This is a group who have conquered Australia, left them bleeding, and who have hung out in the US for a while. It is based around the songwriting skills of Matthew J. Tow who sometimes plays this year with Brian Jonestown Massacre. There is a Beatles/Oasis feel to many of the songs on this record. But singer/songwriter Tow comes out of the wreckage sounding like his own man. The songs are good and distinct all around. ""The Sound and The Fury"" and ""Guiding Star"" are some of their better songs. The mix of acoustic and electric guitars sound like the best thing since Bowie and Mick Ronson stood in a room together. I caught the live show and the Lovetones live are equally brilliant. Tow's voice is very tender and moving. I suggest that you go see them if you can. I wish that they would play more. This is a trip."
5,Purchased for RIMS system,I purchased this as the core heater for a RIMS beer brewing system. It functions well in that application.
4,Pet Shop Boys - I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More,"The long-titled, but still meaningful I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT ANY MORE gets digitally retouched by David Morales, who seems back to form, back in touch with his house roots. Lots of synth sweeps, a solid beat, and the emotion shows its way through. Felix Da Housecat does a shimmery remix with a nice electro bass and some 80s style stabs. And on ""Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus,"" the boys take on the Serge Gainsbourg classic with a cover that even that dirty old French man would appreciate."
4,Pretty Good,"The table and chairs are fine. The chairs are a little hard to fold and unfold--it seems like you're breaking them a little. The table didn't come with any screws and Step2 sent us the wrong ones, so we're still waiting for the correct ones. They've been pretty nice about it, but the shipping isn't that quick."
3,Table/Chair set PLUS extra chairs,"This is a good priced set, but a bit on the wobbly side. The chairs are an excellent size. My 2 yr. twin granddaughters can get in and out of them easily. The table is large enough for their cousins too. I DID buy the extra set of chairs, BUT they don't match the original set in color scheme. The chairs are VERY hard to open and close, so forget about using them that way. Otherwise, pretty stable. An excellent outside set! Mybox was missing the screws and label sheet to apply to table. No biggie though, since that usually gets pulled off."
4,great table,"I bought this table and chairs for my 2 year old and he loves it. easy to put together and not wobbly at all, the chairs do fold up kinda hard. the chairs are sturdy and don't tip. nice smooth table top great for drawing and coloring on. very happy with this, well worth the money"
3,Be careful!!!,"The table is great and the folding legs feture is what we were looking for, but within 10 min of using the table one of the mounts that locks the legs in place snapped off; now the leg will fold and the table will collapse with very little pressure in the right place; very significant design flaw"
2,somewhat flimsy,"Easy to put together. Bulky and somewhat flimsy. Bought it as a portable table to take on vacation with the kids. Would probably get something else, if I saw it before buying."
3,too small,"I returned this table and chair set because it is too small for a growing child. Sturdy and cute, but too small."
3,Very unstable! Shaky!,I'm returning this table that I had bought for my 2.5 yr. old.It's so wobbly! I can't imagine more than 1 child playing on it at the same time. It's spacious but skids constantly on the floor! Even on carpet! The chairs are tiny and skid as well - I already see my girl outgrowing these chair in a heartbeat...For $60 is not worth to keep it!
4,GOOD TABLE,"WE REALLY LIKED THE IDEA THAT THE TABLE CAN FOLD UP B/C IT REALLY CONSERVES SPACE.THE CHAIRS DO NOT FOLD UP INTO THE TABLE LIKE THE PICTURE ON THE BOX SHOWS.I HATE HATE HATE THE YELLOW LEGS, BUT THERE IS A SPECIAL PAINT MADE FOR PLASTICS THAT WE ARE GOING TO PAINT THEM TO A MORE PLEASING COLOR.THE LEGS SEEM SOMEWHAT STURDY. I TRY TO BE CAREFUL WITH THEM BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY SEEM LIKE THE SCREWS AREN'T IN TIGHT ENOUGH, BUT THEY WERE SCREWED IN TIGHT.IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN IT SEEMED IN THE PICS, AND THAT WAS NICE."
5,Grandson loved it!,I bought this book for my grandson for Valentine's Day. He loved it and reads it to me now! I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Great Book,What a cute book! My son loves listening to this book and the illustrations are great. I like it so much that I've ordered 3 Wishes for him and hope to be reviewing that on soon too. Would definitely recommend hard to find fairy tale stories that can be for boys or appeal to them. Glad to have found this one.
5,Whimsical and fun,I bought this as a gift because we enjoy our book so much. It is sweet and intelligent but easy for my daughter (3 yrs) to understand. AND....it doesn't scare her.
4,Great Pop Of 1980,"This disc is Robbie Dupree's very best, he seemed to fade into the woodwork, after this album, but did a very good job on this album. ""Steal Away"" is definitely most sought out song on this disc (and ""Hot Rod Hearts""), but the others have their own appeal, too, just really good pop/soft rock. If you like the late 70's-early 80's sound you will love this."
3,Another Wounded Bird,"Despite the product review, this is NOT the first worldwide CD issue of this album. It was issued in the 90s by Elektra on 7559-60969-2, a copy of which I have in front of me now. I agree with the other reviewer: Wounded Bird don't remaster and don't offer bonus tracks, which is a pity as the end result is lacklustre empty sound of what was a good album (ref Nicolette Larson - ""In the nick of time"" as another example of really poor transfers)."
1,THIS IS BAD,"Some months ago i asked my dad who bought this cd player with my certificate, and i thought this would be a great player. WRONG!! whenever i'm on the train, it is impossible to listen to your cd,especially when it's rap. as soon as the train moves, i have to pause it and wait for the train to slow down before i get more decent sound. ""Anti-shock""? must be a typo. even when i'm home and i listen to it in bed, it bad. when you turn on the extra-DBBS sound, the whole cd gets fuzzy.this is horrible, i'm buying another player. not worth your money"
3,Good value for price,"Decent CD player for the price I paid for it. Headphones are of no use....you would need your own to listen to music. ESP works pretty well in my car. Color will need some getting used to :) I dont see it that much myself. Buy it if you have a cash crunch, for real quality go for Sony or Panasonic."
2,Purple ex-player,"A present from her grand parents, it had internitent power problems, now the switch don't work no more. I'm in the process of sending it in for repair although there was no contact information in the literature. Wish me luck!"
3,Nice CD Player,"Its not red, more or less pink. Its a great CD player, but theheadphones could be better. The bass totally rox! Other than theh/p and the color its a great player. END"
1,NEAR-PERFECT FAIL,"Won't play home-burned cds, only commercially-recorded ones.So power-hungry the cds usually outlast a set of batteries.Slow to start up, slow to play next track and even slower skipping to next track.Sound begins to distort when volume it turned up above 1/4, by 1/2 its static.The only reason I'd buy another is to enjoy the sound of it being stepped on."
2,bad.,"this cd player is D rated material. for one, the battery life is extremely short. about 5 hours on a pair of fresh duracell batteries. that ranks it to a B-. another thing is the sound. about average. thats a C+. then theirs the anti skip. it barely works. all in all, D."
2,Don't go for it.,"Sure, it looks cool, I'll give them that. But the truth is, it's just a big piece of plastic. The 40 Esp doesn't work, it skips just as much as any other cheap cd player, and it breaks easily. The headphones are too easily snapped (They snapped in the first hour that they'd been delivered), and they don't give quite a great volume. Unless you're just looking for something that basically just plays music, is cheap and cool looking, go for it, but if you have the means, look into something brand name."
5,"Exactly as described, well packaged","This order was perfect. I got it much sooner than expected! The product is exactly as described, works well, and was very well packaged for delivery.This was great. When it is finished, I will order again!"
5,GREAT DISH DRYER,THE BEST DISH DRYING SYSTEM WE HAVE FOUND. TAKES UP LITTLE SPACE AND IS VERY EFFICIENT AND GENTLE EVEN ON FINE CHINA.
3,Gas Canisters,Have had problems trying to find this product in camping stores so it was great being able to by a few canisters in the one pack. Everything arrived before the due date and so far everything is good. Thanks.
3,Got to have it but better to buy at local sports center,I purchased the stove from Amazon with no shipping cost but it didn't include the fuel. The Amazon shipped the product promptly and packed it well but you can save substantually if you just make a run to your local camping supply or sports supply center.
1,Expensive,I got this one in the Chinese grocery shop in WestMinister ave for 5$ for the 4pack. Even Ace Hardware sells for 4$a piece which makes 16$/4pack.Amazon is far too expensive.
3,reviewers are right! buy butane canisters at local asian market,"We love our portable butane stove and have had it for about 10 years and on numerous camping trips, and for power failures in our home. It's gotten harder and harder to find the butane canisters for fueling this great little stove. I perused Amazon, all set to purchase or decide to give up and buy a new stove that runs on the propane tanks when I saw all of the reviews about the canisters in local asian markets. THANK YOU! My husband just went and found TONS of them on the shelf at the local Korean Korner store. $5 for a 4 pack and no shipping. So I give the review a 3 - 1 star on availability because it's hard to find and I don't want to pay such a high price online plus high shipping rates, but 5 stars on what an excellent stove this is and so easy to use. The average then is a 3 stars."
4,Perfect for Same Brand Portable Gas Stove But...,"I wish the seller offered a 2-pack of the butane canisters because I don't need 4. As a result, I had to pay a bigger chunk of change for just shipping because the product is a flammable and heavier than one would imagine (who doesn't handle such items regularly). Also, the product details Amazon page should list the exact size of the canisters (oz./mL). The canisters for this type of single burner stove, are 8 oz.The canister works perfectly in the GasOne stove I purchased."
5,AWESOME 'unplugged' release by Swiss rockers!!,"Gotthard are one of the music industries true 'undiscovered legends'! These guys create masterfully crafted, MEMORABLE tunes that are an honorable addition to any rock fan's collection. Bands like Tesla had incredible success with this unplugged format (in Tesla's case-it actually helped launch a mainstream audience for them!). Not to necessarily compare Gotthard with Tesla-Gotthard are much more 'Accessable' hard/pop rockers with songs that have a more mainstream approach. With 'D-Frosted', they give their best unplugged format to some great tracks, including some unavailable on their electric albums. Occasionally, the versions here are even preffered over the electric originals! In short-give this band a try,folks. They are worth EVERY PENNY!! ( my only precaution would be to avoid their first 2 discs-unless you prefer Heavier rock to melodic)."
2,Not Great,"While we only go to the beach once a year for a few weeks, this mat didn't even last one trip before it split apart. In fact, this mat lead me to finally switch to beach blanket because I am tired of replace mats every year."
4,The gungle book,The movie is good - but the W. Disney version is better - buy the W. Disney version only. My kids watch both all the time.
1,disgusting,"I am dismayed to discover that the Disney Empire has gobbled up even this small piece of culture. When I was a child the British movie Kiplings Jungle Book was magical to me, and I listened to the old 78rpm record album countless times. Now when I tried to record those old scratchy 78s for a new baby to listen to, I found that they were hard to hear, and applied to Amazon in the hope I could get a clearer version, I learn that today Jungle Book is Disney. You Disney cartoonists: don't you understand your arrogance in imagining you can come up with a cartoon character that will equal Sabu? Have you even heard of Sabu? May I suggest to you that you might consider leaving Disney and seeking honest employment?"
2,"An Excellent horse story, but not a good Full House book","I'm more intrested in Full House: Stephanie books than horse stories. This is one of my least favorite Stephanie books. If you like horse stories, you'll like this book, but if you like Stephanie books, you won't like this."
5,Gift for friend,"She wanted this movie on DVD, so I bought it for her and she loved it.Quality of DVD is Great, Great picture & sound."
2,A Trilogy of Unhappy Viewing...,"Joey Heatherton, Martine Beswick, Lynn Redgrave, Adam West and Larry Storch - How can you possibly go wrong with 70's camp of these colossal proportions? Well, somehow it's wrong on EVERY level. Three horrible movies, painfully bad acting, no storylines to speak of, nothing at all to do with the best-selling books, the worst of 70's fashion style, no comedy, no drama, no camp value, and the greatest travesty - no real sex or nudity to keep you in your chair! WTF! I have a high tolerance for the ridiculous, and even I fast-forwarded through all three flicks in spite of loving Joey Heatherton and Martine Beswick. Insulting on every level - avoid this collection of garish crap at all costs."
3,Not a comedy,"Title ""The Happy Hooker"" is very misleading.I'm not sure what the director/s were trying to do with this film. Frankly the story was all over the place.Heck ""Saturday Night Fever"" has more ""ACTION"" shots than this movie. However I am a Lyn Redgrave fan, so I'll say this movie is just SO, SO. Not really worth buying."
4,Hypotizing!,"""~This is a great record. Although I must admit that don't always understand what morrison means by his sayings. But I very much like the words he uses and how he combines them. His voice is definately hypnotizing. (t)his intense legacy!"
5,Very happy with my purchase,All went very well with this transaction. The case cracked in shipping which was a small disapointment but item arrived on time and went straight under the christmas tree. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
4,The words Live,"There are countless volumes of poetry lying on dusty shelves, unread and dying. Because Jim Morrison had the oppourtunity,because of his success, to go into a studio on his birthday with his poems,and a bottle of Irish whiskey , we can enjoy his very provocative take on modern American life the way poems are best enjoyed,in the poets own voice. The surviving Doors did a terrific job with the music and sound effects. I've been listening to this album for years, on and off,and it's always like meeting up with an old friend."
2,No One Here Gets Out Awake,"When this record first came out, there were mixed reactions to it. Some regarded this as genius and others were less kind. I personally felt that the record company was trying to make a few extra bucks off of the late Jim Morrison by adding his poetry readings to background music by the surviving members of the Doors. His poetry has a tendency towards being pretentious, vulgar ramblings. When someone ingests as much substance as he did, one could find anything that he said amusing. This is NOT amusing, intelligent, or inspiring. In fact, most of the poetry on this CD is inferior to the material released by the Doors. Explore their other CDs first before you even consider buying this one."
2,Bad Poet Rising,"""I'll always be a word man/Better than a bird man"" - Jim MorrisonRegardless of the critical scorn that greeted this posthumous release, Doors aficionados should listen to Jim Morrison's ""An American Prayer"" (1978) at least once. ""Ghost Song"" and the powerful live recording of ""Roadhouse Blues"" are worth your time. The rest, for the most part, is Bad Poetry - ample proof that Mr. Mojo Risin' excelled as a lyricist."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,"God-awful pseudo-poetry by rock's most over-rated lyricist. The fact that this Rimbaud-wannabe's spoken tripe is considered ""poetry"" by so many people is testament to the moronization of American culture. Buy & read some Keats, Blake, Browning..."
1,Poetry?,"Jim Morrison is a legend, he is not a poet. This is the reason they took drugs in the 60s - how else do you make this crap sound good."
3,The Lizard's Droppings,"This is composed of recordings of Jim Morrison reading his rather dull poems set to background music and sound effects. I'm a Doors fan, so a friend of mine who owns this let me listen to it, but I must say I was disappointed. I was expecting reptilian saturnalia, surrealism and horror, whereas this is quite tame. In fact, it's boring. Segments of live performances are included to liven things up, but the music on here is also included on the fantastic IN CONCERT two-disc anthology, so there isn't much to recommend this. Those looking for Jim freaking out and channeling bizarre imagery should get IN CONCERT instead."
2,Strange Brew,"As a spoken word collection, Jim Morrison strips away the trappings of pop culture and truly shows the power of his poetry. In a way, it shows a direction he may have taken in performance art if not for his untimely death.But the concept is ruined by The Doors, who took Morrison's tapes and recorded nothing more than doodlings in Muzak, which sadly makes the end result a parody of the Beat Generation. Ultimately, this is for Morrison fans who are looking to complete their library of authorized releases."
3,over-rated,"This is of interest to die-hard Doors fans only. I am a Doors freak. And a Jim Morrison fan IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DOORS. Without the Doors Jim wouldn't have amounted to anything (especially with his lack of self-discipline). He was a mediocre poet at best. This collection's high point is the ""Road House Blues"" live Doors rendition. Not the poetry. Jim's editor at Simon and Schuster who worked with him on his poetry said this (in the book THE LIZARD KING): ""I found his poetry interesting. SOME OF IT'S VERY BAD. I suggested taking some of it out, but he didn't. We changed the order. I made some suggestions. `The Lords' was not so good and I thought we should cut some of that out. He didn't want that particularly, but we did some reorganizing."" That about sums up Jim's poetry. (I'll admit he was capable of the occasional short gem). Listen to the Doors music. That's Jim at his best. Not his poetry without the music. END"
1,MYTHS AND DRUGS DON' T MAKE POETRY,"Jim Morrison happened to be a self-indulgent drug-addict occasionally making great pop music. As it was, a profetic look and an enormous consume of alcohol and drugs gave people the idea that this man had something very important to say. The myth seriously reached heights when he, luckily, died a poetic death in a tub (probably in a Jesus-on-the-cross-position, with the hands hanging out). Even that some parts of the music on this album are OK, and even if one agrees that ""Jim's voice is just so captivating"", one can't survey the poetry which after all this album is all about. And Jim's poetry is pretentious, pathetic, simple, self-indulgent and dated in such a degree, that it embarrass the listener. Recommended for early teenagers that hate their parents in a romantic hippie-manner.Instead of wasting time on Jim, check out THE DOORS."
2,A Disgraceful Tribute To A Dead Friend...,"When Jim Morrison recorded the poetry for what ended up being the album 'American Prayer' he purposely did not want any of the other members of the band to join him. Jim Morrison and The Doors did NOT record the poetry together but its unfortunate that the remaining members had to go against their dead friends wishes and taint the sanctity of these tracks with ball room jazz and fluff that sound nothing like The Doors. Take what the band did to these recordings and strip them down to the bone and you have a masterpiece. They overproduced, and overedited the sacred works of a dead poet and its a shame."
4,*Read [California Son]'s review*,"...and certainly ignore the ""official"" review. I think people who criticise Jim for being pretentious just don't ""get it"". This naturally doesn't get the playtime other Doors albums get but it is certainly enjoyable."
4,Look deeper,"This recording is NOT for those who like to be spoon fed. While some can't get past the titles (Lament, for ex), those who get IT will get it. Morrison's rock god icon was only one facet of the man, and here we get to see more of the picture. As for those who criticize the remaining Doors for putting music to his muses, I highly doubt that ""cashing in"" was their motivation. This is good stuff!"
2,Used to like it more than I do now,"First of all, I haven't listened to this album in a long time, but in a weird way, I kind of have. Confused? See, I found a great bootleg online that has the whole poetry session used for this assemblage, and it also includes Jim's last ever recording session (Paris, 1971 with a bunch of not-too-great French hippie session guys) and ""Orange County Suite"" before the remaining Doors put all their overdubs on it, about 30 years after the fact. For the curious, its called ""The Paris Tapes."" As for the Doors version of this album, its alright. The Doors described it pretty well when they called it ""A movie for your ears."" The music is carried off well, but I'm not into the whole thing anymore because of the way Jim's words are chopped up. That great Doors live performance on here of ""Roadhouse Blues"" is now also avaliable on the excellent ""Doors Live In Concert"" collection."
4,Thumbs up,"I liked this book because it had alot of scientific accuracy and attention to detail. What I didn't like was the character's personalities and how they acted. I wasn't too impressed by how they spoke or what they said. For example, Dr. Quest was talking about how a giant squid is an invertabrate and Hadji says ""Invertrabrate?"". I'm pretty sure that at his age he would have known what an invertabrate was. Some of the other dialogue was a little corny as well. However, I did like the pacing of the story which keeps the reader interested and close attention to scientific detail which is so hard to find in books these days."
4,"Great, but not Clarkson's best work...","Overall, this is a very great little DVD. Jeremy is great! However, you get the feeling that some things are missing. Namely, James May, Richard Hammond, and the laughter and silliness that the whole gang usually experiences. Don't get me wrong, Jeremy still says some brilliant stuff, but I have seen some Top Gear episodes that beat this.In conclusion, for $12, its worth it. But you may want to consider spending a bit extra to buy an entire series of Top Gear. Happy buying!"
3,Decent,"I bought this DVD as I am a huge fan of Top Gear and needed more to get me through between episodes. The DVD is basically about a dozen or so car features like Top Gear already shows. There are some cars which Jeremy claims are great and goes through the sideways tire smoking sequences he is known for. And then there are a few cars which he destroys as they are rubbish.The other reviews say that this is not as good as Top Gear, and I will have to agree. The reason is that it is all car review segments which are just as good as ones in the show, but it really gets to be too much. All the other segments of Top Gear along with the interaction of three hosts together really make the show.Basically if you are a huge fan of Top Gear, especially Clarkson's car review segments, its worth picking up, but it's not a must have. If you think the show is all right, it probably wouldn't be worth it."
5,I love Top Gear.. This guy is hilarious!,I really love the BBC show Top Gear. This DVD is a special the Clarkson made outside the series. I was really looking for a DVD of the Top Gear series. This was a good substitute as the jocularity and insight was spot on. I love that they call out manufacturers of terrible unimaginative cars and then find ways to destroy them.. Then there is the heaven part where they praise and review supercars. What is really neat is they way the drive them all out.BBC... I am still waiting for my Top Gear series DVD sets. So please get on it!!
2,Underwhelmed.,"I bought this flight simulator game based on the description that made it sound advanced and highly detailed. It seemed neither to me. The graphics are poor and the key functions are clumsy and don't seem very intuitive. It is possible that I am looking at this game from a completely different perspective as I am used to Microsoft's Flight Simulator with several high-end payware and add-ons that give me an extreme level of realism and performance. Even the PC game Wings of Prey is worlds better with their graphics and realism.Unless I missed something (like a high graphics/rendering mode), this is not what I was hoping it would be."
1,Might be a good game,"This might be a good game, but I don't know for sure. I have tried to ""install"" the game five times and all I get is an error message and to try to reinstall the game. It don't work, therefore I can't play the game."
1,Does not work on Vista,"I bought this sim from Amazon. It was advertised to function with Vista operating system, however when I loaded the sim and tried to play it the mouse would not function. After uninstalling and reinstalling the game and still not working I contacted Ubisoft tech support. They gave me several suggestions to try but none worked. So....I ended up buying a flight sim that I cannot use. Unless you are using windows Xp you might want to stay away form this one."
1,IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 [Game Downolad],"Sadly, I could not get this game to install, and Amazon was more than helpful working out a return--despite it being a download"
2,Too hard to fly.,"I just want to fly a realistic simulated plane and blast some bad guys, not join the friggin' air force. If you're really in to warming up a virtual engine and worrying about proper trim settings before takeoff this is the game for you. There's an arcade-mode but I didn't find that very entertaining either. The graphics ARE very good but play-ability is lacking."
5,A definitive WWII flight-sim,"It might be getting old but it's still the best WWII flight sim out. The flight models are realistic (I've flown real aircraft) but you'll need a force feedback joystick to feel what it's really like, and to feel when you're about to stall (otherwise you have to rely on audio-visual clues).There's a whole community of volunteers creating mods and new aircraft so the sim is still developing. Many of the mods now include 6DOF which makes it much more realistic as you can look around struts and over the nose - […]If you decide to venture online, the folks at HyperLobby (and SimHQ) are friendly, helpful and ready to get you flying (and shoot you down :-) )"
4,Over all very good,I have no complaints about the game itself. Its a very good simulation and well worth the money. I just wish the version I received had included the bonus features being advertised on the product page!!! :(
5,The best air combat sim period.,"I am a military aviation fanatic, and have had countless flight sims over the past 15 yrs. This is by far the best, most realistic, and varied sim. Despite its age, it's been expanded (all the expansions are in this edition) and looks as good as any current product. Both offline and online are fantastic, and there is a HUGE online community; I belong the the Hellhounds squadron which flies often as part of the Danger Dogz. User made campns and misns are plentiful, as are paint schemes and many other great additions that are countless. Now there are many mods being made as the code is open, and a huge amount of planes, ships, etc are being added to the already vast amount the Russian creators gave us over the yrs."
5,This is absolutely Fantastic!,"Hello Folks,My family and I used to play IL2 Sturm all of the time. You can make up your own maps, missions, scenarios very easily.The 1946 version is the entire IL2 series and throw in 32 new planes and 200+ missions, etc., and you have a mind-blowing game for only $20.You absolutely cannot beat the value and versatility of this game.I am now installing the 1946 game in my Mom's PC, and she is going to be in store of a real treat!Regards,JohnYoga"
4,IL2 1946,"If you have never owned the Sturmovik/Forgotten Battles/Pacific Fighters series the game is more than well worth the money. In my case I already had the series so the IL2 1946 seemed more to me like an add-on (like the Forgotten Battles Aces Expansion Pack). However the game was priced right, equivalent to purchasing an ""add-on"" and not the usual [...] dollarsor so that most new releases cost. I have had lots of fun with this series,once you get over the initial learning curve you get ""addicted"" to this flight sim."
3,ALL AXiS MachineGun-Sights are off Center,"i bought the $ 19.99 DVD (for my son's gift) sold & shipped by the Amazon.com this month of September 2009 and installed it in my windows XP Sp3 - Dell Xps 400 - 3.2 ghz speed - 4gb ram memory - 250 hd - sound blaster xFi extreme - VGA - evga 8800 gts 512 mb. The results after the iL-2 Sturmovik 1946 - DVD installations: ALL of the AXiS MachineGun, GunSights are off-centered from 120 degrees to 180 degrees ++(+---(+) but ALL of the ALLiES MachineGun GunSights, they are very perfect = (+) [...] for Refund-thank you very much Amazon. The 5 stars of the game is there, but i can only give 3 stars because of the problems, maybe next time."
5,Still the best WWII Combat sim you can get!!,"IL-2 features more realistic physics than many popular combat sims (even today), it provides good visuals (the atmospherics in particular), the multiplayer is still thriving, and the netcode is great for combat and formation. The damage models are decent, the sim is just a whole lot of fun! If you consider yourself a flight simmer, you already own this...right?"
3,IL2 1946,"You can download this game at ubisoft for 4.99 right now.till July 18thamazon sent me a game with the disk missing, so I`am going to ubisoft site anddownload this great game.fyi: the game was Pacific Fighters that had disk2 missing.Not taking any chances this time."
1,Horrible,The dance re-mix is just awful and Alanis' singing at the beginning of the live version of So Pure just sucks. Make a better album next time.
4,A Different World,"Even though this novel is set in Brooklyn, it spotlights a culture largely unfamiliar to many modern readers. Tzippy, raised in a traditional Orthodox Jewish family, falls in love with Bryan, whose family embraces the modern Orthodox traditions. After reading this book, you will be aware of the reasons why this causes such consternation in their respective families. Tzippy and Bryan are constantly changing, while trying to find balance in their lives between family traditions, their religious faith, and of course, the outside world."
5,Could not put the book down!,"This book is a masterpiece in writing. Every sentence is a joy to read. The story speaks to the challenges of living a religious life in a modern world but also helps us all remember the simple pleasures of family, history, and tradition.I opened the book and did not close it until it was done. The mental imagery the author creates in every sentence makes the book more like a movie than a novel."
3,A Disappointment,"While I loved Mirvis' first book, I found this one to be a disappointment filled with many unsympathetic characters. I felt, almost, as if this book was rushed, yet I waited a long time for this second novel. There were many unanswered questions in my mind, like so many loose threads. Characters like Ileana have a crisis and then get the proverbial literary bandaid. This book was like cotton candy to me, all fluff and no substance. I was so disappointed."
4,an Orthodox Jewish reviewer,"In response to a previous Orthodox Jewish reviewer, I just have to say that as a young, liberal, modern Orthodox Jew, I enjoyed this novel a great deal. I would be delighted to have my daughter (if I had one) read it. Tova Mirvis obviously knows the Orthodox Jewish world quite well. It's wonderful to read a novel about the world I live in, the details of which few writers truly grasp. It's not a perfect novel; there is a bit of stereotypical characterization, and the plot gets a bit thin at the end. I do quite like the end, though. I would definitely recommend this book. (I also have no clue what that previous reader was referring to when she said this book hinted at inappropriate things. Well, of course the characters have sex; they're married, aren't they? Since when were Jews scared to mention a married couple having sex?)"
4,"Great story, but a weak conclusion","I very much enjoyed the story, and felt that I understood a lot of what the characters were going through. It helps to have some exposure to Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox, or you may get lost.My only real complaint is the end of the story (don't worry, I'm not going to give it away). The characters are developing in interesting ways, maturing, etc. And then the book ends rather suddenly - many loose threads are never tied together, and there's no feeling of completion.Maybe the author is leaving room for a sequel, and she couldn't figure out what direction it's going?"
2,"First part - OK, the rest - not so much","I got a good impression of this book by leafing through the first few chapters. It is about two kids: an observant girl becoming more secular and a more secular guy drifing the other way until the two meet. Too bad the good stuff fizzled out. The characters started acting in one-dimensional way right after Tzippy's wedding. Or even earlier, when they came back from Israel. The book should have ended there: the rest feels like a forced and disappointing sequel. The best part was Bryan's family, coping with his teenage rebellion. I read to the end to see what happened to them. Unfortunately, that line wasn't developed much."

2,Sound leaves something to be desired,"I just returned mine. It was compact and worked well, however, I thought the sound quality was poor."
2,Forget those CD-R's,"This player works OK, except with CD-R's, which was one of the reasons I wanted it to begin with. My CD-R's play fine on my old player, but not this cute portable one. I was very disappointed."
2,Not for me,"I purchased this CD player at a local store. I needed a portable device and this one was recommended by the store employee. I was only able to use the CD player sucessfully once, then it stopped working. I was trying to play a CD I purchased, not one that was CD-R. I would not recommend this CD player."
3,Cute but fuzzy,"This cd player is compact, cute and handy. However, especially when listening with headphones at low volumes there is a very annoying background buzz. It goes away at higher volumes. But- for the visually inclined, it looks great on my desk!"
5,Great Shaw flick without the Venoms,"momkey kung fu AKA stroke of death is one of the best shaw bros movies. The kung fu rarely lets up and its all high quality action. The monkey style here is some of the best ive seen.Like a shaw film the sets are good, great re-masterd quality....I know, I suck at writing reviews."
2,Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship from the Founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"As Sam says he is not a numbers guy, he is a sales guy and as such, he has created a book that is essentially a long advertisement for Dogfish Head. The author also admits to having ADD and it shows in the writing. The chapters are unnessary as the book is one long brain-drain. If your looking for a book on entrepreneurship and starting your own business look elsewhere. Beer lovers may find this interesting."
5,Additional generic awesome review!,"Let's be honest - if anyone knows about brewing and the brewing business, it's Sam. His chronicles of a half-madman half-beer-lover turned brewery owner are fantastic. He shows that you really don't have to know about business in order to run one, but for Heaven's sake learn from your mistakes and get all the help you can. This is incredibly inspiring and reassuring for those considering opening his or her own brewery, reviewer included. It should however, like anything he writes, come with a coupon for a free four/six pack of Dogfish brew."
1,Feel Good Beer for the Feel Good Person,"Okay, everyone who has read this loves Sam's beer, its amazing. His beer makes you feel good, and so does the book. The problem is that we readers dont want to feel good, we want to know how to make the stuff that makes you feel good and how to get that feel good stuff to people. I suppose that those tidbits about overcoming bad business blues is important, but I would think that the home brewer already has a penchant for overcoming those obsticals. Anyhow, its more like a coach giving a speach before the big game, not the coaching required to get you prepared for the big game."
5,Great book about becoming an entrepreneur,This book is applicable to anyone who wants to dive into the small business world or business at all. Sam takes his creation of a brewing empire and applies it across the board for entrepreneurs. Great book!
3,more about sam than the brewery,"The book is well named - its more about entrepreneurship, and not very much about the beer industry, and frankly, its about Sam, and Sam's business, and what Sam thinks about Sam's business. There is a great deal about Sam's incredibly brilliant product strategy - and it **is** a brilliant product strategy!If you are interested in the brewing industry / business, there is not so much here.The book is entertaining although not that informative, and reads like many new age business books. The founder has been tremendously successful. Suggest ""beer school"" if you want to learn about critical factors in brewing industry."
2,Off Centered Book,Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point. It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup. There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared). He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic. At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly. It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book. If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest.
5,Short Review: Brewing Up a Business,"This book could be the bible for small business entrepreneurs, especially for those interested in the craft brewing segment of business. It offers great advice on both left and right brain aspects of running a business successfully. It brings to light the importance of community, culture, personality, creativity, and teamwork in the small business world. Sam Calagione really emphasizes educating his mission and vision to fellow employees and customers. It is fun and easy to read with some hilarious stories included. The craft beer segment of the beer brewing industry is very interesting and truly unique. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery and Sam are visionaries within their profession. Great story, great beer!"
2,Light on business insight,"I didn't find this book very useful. The marketing and strategy considerations are very basic and didn't give me a lot of new insight into brand creation. The examples that he uses from other industries border on trite and are much better illustrated elsewhere. If you are starting from scratch, however, it may be an interesting place to start. It asks some of the basic questions that an entrepreneur needs to answer and has some entertainment value, albeit with frequent and not-so-subtle doses of self-promotion."
3,Not what I expected.,"First of all let me say this book is NOT about brewing beer and has very little to do with the process of opening any sort of beer establishment. It was a little like a high school business book at times. Example - I don't care about how important he perceives monthly employee meetings to be and I certainly don't care to read 5 pages about why he feels this way. I'm not interested in the three steps to creating a business plan or any other ""steps"" to anything that he often lays out like he's the Warren Buffet of the restaurant industry. Overall however, there are some funny stories and a very few beer related topics that make it a 2.5/5 in my opinion. I probably would not recommend it to a friend."
3,Mildly disappointed in the direction,"I bought this book looking for a little more insight into developing a microbrewey but found although it is interesting, it is full of platitiudes concerning what I would call ""business culture."" The author has had unbelievable success as an enterprising brewer but the book does not translate this into any advice for someone who hopes to follow in his footsteps. Read it for the story and for sheer enjoyment but don't look to it for any kind of blueprint to microbrewery business success."
1,Hotlegs Workout Review,"This is the most stupid and boring workout video I have ever seen (and did). I don't know who this instructor is, never heard of her before. I picked it up because of the title to be honest. She has nice set of legs for sure but she nor her routine offer any motivation at all to go through her tedious and painfully boring workout. I have 100+ workout videos and can confidently say that you can skip this one and save your money and time."
5,"A superb routine for improving muscle strength, muscle tone, flexibility, and posture","Penny ""Hot Legs"" Lancester enthusiastically presents Hotlegs Workout, an inexpensive but effective and fun aerobic exercise program designed for a cross-training circuit with interval levels designed to accommodate all ages and physical fitness levels. Exercises in the routine include high and low impact aerobics, boxing, dance, yoga, Pilates, and floor work. A superb routine for improving muscle strength, muscle tone, flexibility, and posture, Hotlegs Workout is a great personal training program to follow three times a week or more for improved health and fitness. 75 minutes, color."
4,I really like this stand,"I received this stand and I was a bit intimidated so I waited over a week before I took it out of the box. I am a 39 year old female and I put this together by myself with a hammer and a screwdriver. I was so proud of myself. It did take a few hours but it was worth it in the end.This City Live TV Stand in Honeydew finish by South Shore Furniture was purchased for my 50"" plasma and it is perfect. I did not put on the back piece with the holes for the cords. I think it looks classier with the open back look.I received compliments on how nice it looks."
1,...,"Steps can't:- sing, dance, do anything sensibleSteps can :- make fools of themselves, give you an ear-ache, give you a head-ache"
2,Not the best skateboard,"This skateboard is really durable and all, but the wheels are crooked. Also, the wheels aren't even real skateboard wheels. I have to pedal like 3x to have it go about 10 feet. A normal skateboard would go 2-3x more than that when I pedal 3x. It's a really rough and bumpy ride. This board is not good for tricks like ollies, kickflips, varials, etc. either."
5,Heaven,"This is the first CD I bought by Aeoliah, and like it very much. Very peaceful...Sounds like what heaven would sould like."
5,Long overdue and rich in experiences,"This historical volume contains a wealth of information about the MIT experience as seem from the black perspective -- in all its diversity. Dr. Williams' insightful telling of these personal stories, coupled with individual interviews, gives the reader a sense of the fullness of the MIT experience across a broad spectrum, from the estatic to the achingly painful. A compelling read, whether you want a true glimpse of the Black scholar's experience at MIT or to enrich your knowledge of the Institute itself."
5,Mainstream fiction hanging out with the Harlequins,"There's plot. There's characterization. There are reasonable motives for both events and actions. It's well-written. In other words, although published as genre, Maternal Instinct would stand up well as mainstream fiction."
1,Pass on this one.,"This book is not every well written, even the grammar is not correct. But more importantly, the interpretation is not much different from what lots of other people are teaching, that America will be destroyed.Even the interpretation it presents is not given very well. Just use ""look inside the book"" carefully before you buy this book and you will likely get all you want. I should have read more before buying.There are plenty of web sites teaching that America is end-time Babylon in the Old Testament and will be destroyed, so there is nothing new here, or accurate, as I do not believe that America is Babylon in the Old Testament nor the Daughter of Babylon, nor do I believe that America will be destroyed."
3,An easy way to pass weekend,"I probably would not remember the characters from this book next week, but as a way to pass a weekend, this book will do. It has a plot that's easy to follow, but I really don't see what the next book could be about. There were no real second characters developing in this book. I love reading books with connected plots and I usually know which book is from which series, but I don't think I will be looking for the next one of this series specifically. I guess, if I see it, I will get it.My advice, if there are other books on your bookshelf waiting to be read, read them first. Save this one for a lay-over at the airport or something."
2,"Clunky, Trite, Predictable","The title says it all and applied to the plot and the character developement. I finished the book only because I finish what I start, but this book was a real test of that practice.If you want an easy read the this is the book for you, however you should expect your credulity to be challenged from time to time."
4,Likable twist on the Robin Hood premise.,"Lady Pearl Moreston is sick of her stepmother pressuring her to marrying before her 21st birthday. When she overhears that lady plotting a trap to enforce a betrothal, she decides on a radical plan: escape by becoming a servant.... This social reformer also wants a perspective on the life of a commoner. Pearl and her abigail work in the kitchens at a society party. When she is in danger of being recognized, she flees the scene in the company of Luke St. Clair. Luke is an intriguing person. His lodgings, though in the dangerous Seven Dials, are elegantly furnished. He is the Saint of Seven Dials, robbing the rich and giving much of the proceeds to the poor. They both have surprises in store, as Pearl investigates Luke's mysterious past and finds the astonishing truth...."
2,Could use some story development,"I enjoyed the story, however the passion and actions scenes left me wanting more. I feel like they could've been better developed. It seemed like the events were over before they began."
5,Perfect gift for a boy,My grandson (1 yr) won't take off his Tool Belt. Perfect gift for his birthday. Was just dissappointed that the hat seemed more for an older child.
4,Good starter tool set,"Hat on, belt in place! Our two year old contractor was certainly pleased. He wore the hat and belt everywhere and the tools were well suited to his little hands. The tools were a little difficult to get in and out of the loops but he kept working at it and seemed determined not to give up. Great imagination enhancement. We also bought the John. Deer tractor book which added immensely to his fun outside after we read the story."
1,INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED!,"This was a gift for my son from Santa this morning, only to open it and we are unable to slide the ""talking box"" part to the middle of the belt loop. WHY would it not already be attached to it?! Instead, you get them as two seperate pieces and it is completely impossible to slide it through to the middle because of the loops that are to hold the tools. It will not go over those. I am so terribly disappointed. Especially to pay that kind of money, it's a licensed John Deere product, and my son is disappointed on Christmas morning.. what the heck. Do not waste your money. If anyone knows of how to get it through there (without unsewing the loops, and resewing them back) then please feel free to comment back."
4,John Deere Tool belt,Toy is ok - but it was on the Amazon site cheaper after I bought it. Our grandson did like the tools and the belt and hat though so I guess it was worth it!
2,Takes longer to get out of packaging than your child will play with it,"This is one of those toys that is wired to the cardboard. Five minutes later, I am still struggling to get these toys out. Just what you need to be messing with at Christmas. It appears I may need to get the needle nose pliers out to undo the wires just to get the toys out. If it had not been a gift, I would be returning this asap simply out of frustration."
4,Loved Tonja Walker too... the whole cast,I hadn't seen this film in a long time and had forgotten Tonja Walker was in it... I have been a fan of hers for a long time. This must have been one of her first movies.Matt Dillon was believable and charming and also illicits great sympathy. Cindy was good too. A great coming of age to real love story.
4,Sweet sweet movie,"A sweet love story. Poor boy falls in love with rich girl. The parents try to stop it. They elope are are hunted down by the parents. A terrible ""secret"" is revealed which turns out to be false, but not before causing disastrous results. I've actually seen two endings to this movie. Not sure which ending this DVD will hold."
3,good for a sunday afternoon,"I liked it because it wasn't a ""high stress"" movie that I had to keep with. It has a decent plot and watching it is sort of the equivelant of ""curling up with a good book"". It's a nice love story especially for those of us that appreciate the old ""brat pack"" of the 80's."
3,Small Town Romeo and Juliet,"Matt Dillon and Cindy Fisher turn in very good performances in this overlooked film. Has a feeling of summer's gone by, a fatalistic melodrama. Fine support from Broderick Crawford as Fisher's colonel grampa, Yvonne DeCarlo( Lily of The Munsters) as a Louisiana boarding house proprietor, and Susan Tyrrell as wayward prostitute Laura Mae Beauvoir."
4,MATT DILLION IS DARLING!,Okay so this may not be THE best Matt Dillion film but you must admit he is rather darling. The film has some touching moments and some really weird ones (Lora Mae....she is TOO much!)There were actually 2 endings to this film. One in which the character Ginny died and the one that is on this DVD. I wish they would have shown both and added a few extras. It's a worth buying to add to you Matt Dillion collection.
4,Florida Landscape Plants,"This is a worthwhile book for a number of reasons, however, it has one major omission. The positive factors: 1) Excellent plant descriptions including details like salt tolerance level; 2) wonderful (and most appreciated) treatment of botanic names by giving the pronunciation and derivation of the Latin words (Thanks!). The omission concerns color photographs of the plants discussed. The publisher included a few color pages of plant drawings which are mostly useless and confusing. A good garden book needs to have extensive color photographs. I am sure that the author would agree!!"
4,Helpful for the new Florida resident,I purchased this book because it was highly recommended in a Florida Gardening magazine. I am new to Florida recently moving here from the Northeast. I was looking for someway to link plants I see in neighbors' yards with what might work in our spaces.The only thing I was disappointed in is that the book's pictures are not in color. Colors would help me better link plants I see with what's in the book.
4,"Useful, but older edition","The 1969 edition is illustrated with drawings of the plants. Each gets a page telling the family, type of plant, how to identify it, it's habit of growth, foliage description, flowers, fruits, uses in landscaping, habitat, light requirements, soil requirements, salt tolerance, availability, culture, propagation, and pests. Really quite a thorough book."
3,It's pretty cool.,"I found out that installing this was a little difficult cause you have to use some tools but not extremely time consuming. The ""tactical shroud"" gives it a cool look and all but I wasn't extremely impressed with the flatline barrel. I used evpensive paintballs so I'm pretty sure it was the barrel that was sending the balls left and right. They did go a little a bit farther but now I'm looking how to make my gun more acurate."
2,Two whacks of your Latin teacher's ruler,"It's actually ""reductio ad absurdum,"" as any devoted high school Latin student should know. Too bad this isn't the only mistake in the book, since Cobb tries very hard to present stimulating anecdotes. Unfortunately, she neglects the legions of dedicated physical chemists in academia and industry who have contributed the vast majority of advancements in the field by thoughtful, systematic experimentation."
1,does not print,"Well the calculator calculates, however,the reason I purchased it was for the printing and it does not print. I will be calling where it came from."
3,"Fantasy, dark humor and terror","The Abominations of Yondo is a collection of short stories written by the late Clark Ashton Smith. It includes a variety of stories from the various worlds he created, such as Hyperborea, Zothique, and Averoigne. The stories tend to be very descriptive, and at times leave the reader wanting for more plot. On the other hand, the richness of the descriptions shows just what a master Smith was of the English language. There are turns of phrase that are beautifully unique and indicative of a creative master. In addition, these tales often reveal Smith's dark and sometimes bitter sense of humor. While most of the stories take place in a ""fantasy"" setting, ""The Dweller in the Gulf"" is truly terrifying, and worthy of the praise heaped upon Smith by the great H.P. Lovecraft. Overall, a disappointment if you're looking for horror (though the above mentioned story is thrilling), but for fans of Smith or descriptive fantasy, this is one worth owning."
1,Misleading Title and reviews,"The reviews here are for the anthology of stories called ""The Abomination of Yondo"". This book is not the anthology - just the single short story. The holders of the sacred rights to Mr Smith's works have found a clever way to stretch the monetization of the asset it would seem. Roll on, death of Copyright for long dead authors..."
1,buyer beware,You are not getting the collection! Just the story . I am very disappointed and fell ripped off.Haven't read the story yet so no comment
4,relaxing,"I enjoy the 4 tracks of relaxing scripts very much. The voice is very soothing, and the music compliments beautifully. The four tracks offer a nice variety of relaxation processes: body awareness, visualization, breathing focus, positive self-talk. The reason I gave this item 4 instead of 5 stars is because I actually find that sometimes the script is read too fast, I find myself falling behind, and, well, this stresses me out. I suppose as I continue to use this, I'll get better at it."
1,Stress Reduction,One needs to be sitting in a classroom to use this stress reduction CD to much verbage with little to no relaxation methods.
3,CD review,very nice. relaxing and worthy for anyone who needs help relaxing to relieve muscle tension or lessen anxiety during a stressful time.
4,Keep it Up and You'll See Results,"Most people (who aren't doing yoga as we speak) will find this cheesy. At first, it's hard to avoid feeling silly following his ""soothing voice"" as you go through progressive relaxation of your body. But the trick is to remember the goal: You want your body to get to the point where it can recognize when it is stressed and to automatically relax on it's own. The only way to get there is to practice, practice, practice. So remember that each time you are going through one of the sessions, you are practicing. After practicing enough (10,000 times, say? Read ""Mastery"" immediately if this freaks you out) your body will become an expert at relaxation. Don't forget why you started doing it in the first place: to become a better spouse, father or mother, friend, worker, etc., etc. Relax and go with it."
3,It's ok...,"Didn't hook me in or blow me away in any way. Not better then other products I've used, but not worse either. Guess it's ok?"
4,Letting Go on Stress CD,This was recommend from my Dr. It a great way to learn how to relax and cope at times. I am very pleased. Pricing & Shipping was great.
4,Excellent Stress Reducer,This is one of the best CDs I've used to relax at bedtime. Emmett Miller's voice is very soothing and I think the most valuable part of the CD is where he teaches the listener relaxation responses and how to teach the techniques to themself.
5,It's The Real Deal!,"This came in the sony package with the sony logo on it. It is exactly like the wall charger and cord that came with my psp. So, if you need one, get it. This is a great price! they usually sell for around thirty dollars. By the way it works great!"
4,What a life saver,"I was looking for a PSP AC adapter once my only adapter broke. I went to several stores and none would carry it except the car adapter (I don't even own a car!). I was so glad to have found it on amazon.com so from now on, anytime I need to find a must have, I look here. When the adapter came in to me, I found it in used condition, sealed nevertheless but I could tell it was not packaged to warehouse standards. That is minor issue, but I am a bit worried what other kinds of products get sent over and they have signs that they are not new, not from the warehouse and could have been used."
3,OEM adptor,This is a Sony OEM adaptor that is way overpriced but it works for the PSP. I wish Sony would be a bit more reasonable with pricing.
2,PSP 3001 MFG cable,"Charged PSP for six months and then stopped working completly, I think the cord going to the psp frayed or something."
2,BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!!,"I received this adapter today in the mail and the adapter that fits in the playstation is sony BUT the plug part is not, it has 4-5 different japanese or chinese writings on the wiring, there are two totally different pieces, they don't even fit together properly, my husband had to force the plug piece in the adapter so it won't fall out, it does work however, but the pieces just dont match, its as if they ran out of the matching pieces and found something somewhat comparable and sent it to me!!!! I would have rather bought a knock off that fits properly than this one!"
5,not a game,"If you want your PSP powered to the XTREME then buy this NOW!!! (seriously brah, just buy it if you lose your junk like me)Also it powers my cat"
4,PSP AC adaptor,"Work like a charm, my dog chewed through the one that came with the game so this helped to get my game going again."
1,It sucks,after i broke my old charger i got this one for a good price.but when i got it it wouldnt even charge my psp and if you put your ear close to it it make this weird ringing sound PLEASE DO NOT BUY! ! ! ! ITS CRAP!
3,"For coffee tables, not collectors","Great pictures but short on content. The layout is first-rate, and the author was able to shoot some historic timepieces, but the company index reads more like a well-worded ad than an explanation of what makes good watches great. Also leaves out mention of some interesting or odd collectibles. Could also use some diagrams of working watches. Otherwise, it's too technical. A beautiful book, nonetheless. One which will get picked up by non-collectors as well."
3,Nice but short&#65533;,"Nothing much to learn from this well illustrated book, at least nothing more than what can be found in ""wriswatch annual"". For newbies only."
2,"Disposable as the next empty, pop shell of a song. 2.2 stars.","With each release, this chick has steadily gotten worse!! Will it be even worse with the next release?? I doubt it. It should be a bit more polished, and a bit more serious then this crap!I don't like Avril too much these days. But strangely, I'm totally Happy that She decided to settle down, with a great Guy like Derrick. I seriously wish them the very, VERY Best, and I can only Hope for Avril's musical style to improve on the next release.2.2 stars."
2,WTF??,ok what the hell has happened to avril? her old cd's were waaay better. like this is soo not her. i thought let go and under my skin were better. this is more hyper bouncy kinda songs..not really like her at all. ok i gotta admit this song is pretty catchy but i heard the other songs on youtube of her new cd and they're crap. she's basically talking. not singing. so i'd advise not to get it
3,She can do better,"I haven't heard the B-side. I cannot stop listening to Girlfriend, but it's not as good as her past stuff, and certainly not as good as her Let Go stuff. It has a really 'pop-y' sound, and I like the Let Go style better, and those fishnet stockings from the video do not suit her. Although I still like her, and this song is pretty good, it's not as good as her other stuff, so if you want Avril Lavigne stuff, you should get Let Go first."
4,I love it...,"My Sunday/Church School teacher uses this as our lesson book and I love it. It's scripturally based and all lessons include plenty of scripture references; not complicated and it covers the basic questions/concerns of new believers, ""old"" believers, those who want to believe and the hesitant/reluctant.I always keep an extra(s) on hand to give to someone. The lessons are mostly 3-4 pages, a few are longer, so it's a simple read. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
5,Wonderful!!,"This sweet story is exactly what I expected from Miss Read! I have read a number of her books and have completely enjoyed each one! It is a sweet tale of a life long friendship, taking them through tragedy and victory! I would highly encourage one to read it as well as her other books!"
4,YUM!,"This is the best blackberry preserves I've ever had.And the jar is quite big. I would have given it 5stars if it had less sugar in it. I think the sugarfrom the fruit is enough,..you don't need to addextra..and then perhaps diabetics like myself,.non-insulin)could have a bit more than just ateaspoon, because it's really good stuff."
4,Pricey but nice,"Bought these for a gift for my mother. She is very pleased with the quantity, quality and presentation of the jelly. You can find cheaper preserves-but if you are looking for nicer packaging this is a nice choice. Jars are reusable and very nice."
1,Not worth a dime!,There is nothing new in this book. It is basically a retelling of ancient information. It almost seems as if the author used textbooks from the 1960s for his/her research.I would not recommend this book to anyone ... no way ... no how!
4,Solid first effort. Looking forward to the next one.,"I picked up Blue Justice on a whim--it was on the shelf below an Evan Hunter title I was seeking. I had been reading the usual best-selling techno-thriller writers lately, but had been dissatisfied with most of their recent efforts. I was pleasantly surprised by this book. There was no single place where I felt let down by the writer or the story. Although it was abundantly clear ""whodunnit"" early on (as I'm sure the author intended), and although I started to have my suspicions why towards the end of the book, this was a good enough read that I enjoyed reading it all the way to the end. I look forward to Ms. Kadow's next book, ""Burnout"" which Amazon's site says should appear next year."
4,Old fun in a New Style,"I played this game a few years ago, when the first version came out, and thought that I would try this newer version. It is a great game, don't get me wrong, but if you absolutely loved the old style of the first game, don't get your hopes up with this version. This version has 3-D graphics, multiple view points, better aiming, missions, lots of stuff. Great game, but definately a new look."
3,Controls take some getting used to,"I've enjoyed the Worms franchise since Worms2. I liked it better in 2D because the controls were not as complex. Part of the lure of Worms2 was that you could just sit down and play after a minute or two. Now they have tutorials to teach you how to play.As always, the weapons are fun, but harder to control, especially the ""flying"" weapons. I do like playing the campaign games as well."
1,Disappointing,"I was a huge fan of the original game and the Worms Armageddon and played them for years. I stopped playing Worms4: Mayhem after a week. This game is just no fun, handling is difficult, graphics are terrible and it has a total lack of original ideas. Not recommended."
4,good game but gets boring fast,It's a great game at first but it definitely has a new look. Like other people have said if you really loved the old worms games don't just buy this because it's a worms game. The problem i have with it is that it's really short. the campaign is on the short side and not too hard. Once you've beaten the campaign there's really not much left to do. This game is a lot of fun until you beat it and even then it continues to be fun but gets old pretty fast.
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this because I couldn't get Worms World Party to work on my computer. Unfortunately, Worms just doesn't translate well into 3D. It becomes less crazy and less entertaining. I would probably stay away from this product unless you have no other multiplayer games."
2,It's broken after 4 days!,I bought it as a gift for 4 children and they loved it. The sing-along tape wasn't used much. The children used it to create a talk show of their own. But the microphone broke after 4 days of energetic use. I suppose it would have lasted longer if the children had been more careful. But it was meant to be a toy and should have been built to take SOME abuse.
1,Cheap Product,"This is a very cheap product, don't waste your time ordering it. It' just not worth the money you pay."
5,"Precious, Precious, Precious Book......I am so very thankful",This must be the most Heart felt book I have read of HSR. I enjoy reading all of HSR poetry. She gives new eyes in which we are able to see the love of the Lord for His children! Her purpose in life was to write.....I am so thankful she followed the Lords lead with pen in hand and His word definitely in her heart. I am not sure how anyone could part with this particular book. I am sooo pleased that you did. Ms Rice just had that special touch....Gods touch.
5,Every teen should read this (and maybe adults too),"I read this book to see if I should pass it on to my teenagers. I found it easy and enjoyable to read. I think young teens from age 10 - 14 would relate especially well to this story. However, I think all ages would find answers to questions that will draw them into a closer relationship with God. It takes a very down to earth and realistic approach to life at that age and how a relationship with God can help you through anything."
4,An Introduction to True Faith Through the Thoughts of a Teenage Girl - American Author's Association Review,Humprey uses her unique experience as a psychologist and creates a poignant and emotional story of a young woman who is going through the most distressing period of time in her life--early adolescence. The story is told through thirteen-year-old Leslie as she writes in her diary to God. The author addresses both major and seemingly minor issues that confront teens of either gender and brings them to gentle resolution through the practice of faith and spirituality. I would emphatically recommend this book for any teen who is unsure of their place in their world and the place of God within it.Karl L. Kruger for the American Author's Association
4,Useful for parents of teenagers,"As a mother of two teenagers and one ""yet to be teen"", this book was a good reminder to me about the issues that teens face. The issues that I think are big, may not be to them and the issues I think are trivial may be huge to them. The book also brought back memories as I kept a ""Dear God"" journal myself during high school. It too, helped me get through some tough times, knowing that God was listening and there for me.As a parent I have learned that I am not always the person that my children want to take advice from, so I am passing the book on to them. They can learn from Leslie. My 18 year old daughter started reading it when I was done and asked if she could take it with her to college so she could finish it!"
5,"Authentic, familiar voice of youth","I remember feeling the same way Leslie felt about life--the questions, the insecurities, the fears, desires and dreams. I see her in my students and in the young people in my life. I'm passing this book on to my stepdaughter, now on the threshold of adolescence, confident that she'll find a familiar and authentic voice in Leslie's talks with God.Fellow children's author, C. Dawn McCallum, author of THE CARETAKER OF TREE PALACE[..]"
4,Keepin' It Real: A Young Teen Talks with God,This book was very interesting to read. I found that I gained insights into the thinking of teens by reading this book. I hope to use some of the insights when I deal with my sons and teenage students at church. This book was well written. I would suggest all young people take the time to read this book.
5,Powerful and moving,"This should be required reading for today's teens. Keepin' It Real represents the emotionally moving voice of a girl sharing her inner most feelings and experiences. She writes with so much depth and wisdom, sometimes it is hard to believe her youth. I wish I had been that expressive at her age. Her questions and thought processes are thought provocating. Keepin' It Real would be an excellent tool for opening teens up in group discussions and teaching them the power of expression, both written and verbal. Thoroughly enjoyed reading Keepin' It Real."
5,Teens will find an empathetic voice within these pages,"As a mother of five children, one of whom is coming up on the teen years, I found Keepin' It Real a good reminder of the deeply-felt concerns of those no longer children but not yet adults. This is a genuine glimpse into the thoughts of a young person struggling to sort through some of life's toughest questions. It highlights the importance of the journey itself, and of keeping God always in sight. As I read it, I felt I easily could have been reading my own diary from my growing up years, when emotions were high and confusion an everyday feeling. Both parents and teens will benefit from a read-through of this sensitive approach to growing up in today's world."
2,Disappointment,"Reviewing cover and not content. When I purchase something, I'm adding it to my personal collection and therefore am after appearances as well as content. Therefore a description of a listed item should state that the cover looks like it has been rained on but content viewable or words to that effect. I was very disappointed with this DVD but being from the old school, I made do. In other words, I created a new cover for the DVD and added it to my collection. As always, as buyers we should be aware that all is not as it may seem. No great harm, no great foul...just a little wiser."
3,Should not say it is in stock when it isn't,Never received this product. Order was cancelled due to the provider not having it.....
4,Monte Walsh,"I enjoy watching Monte Walsh for the feelings it holds for the last days of the old time cowboy, and what that era might have been like. the movie has it's tender moments too, dealing with the gentle love affair between the main character and a charming but sad 'soiled dove' according to the Old West usage, which is kinder than our term ""hooker,"" played by the daughter of Ingrid Bermann.The movie is not helped by the gunfight at the end; I felt it was unnecessary when I first watched it, and still do. I do like watching the movie though, which is as much as I need say. Go watch Monte Walsh for yourself and see if I am right."
5,This was America's Cowboy,"One of Tom Selleck's finest pieces. This was America as it was for the soon to be turn of the century cowboy. The west was quickly being partitioned and bought up and the railroad saw to that. Not sure what the unionist was getting at in the previous review, but this was just how it evolved, good, bad or indifferent. Isabella Roselini still sends shivers up my spine. So well cast and played as the lovelorn ""countess"" as Monte referred to her. I loved her line about not having anyone to play with in the snow. Down and dirty, real life transition of the old to new west. Monte Walsh will allways be a favorite."
2,Hoped it would be better...,"I found much of this movie to be slow and lacking. I had hoped for so much more from the cast. I couldn't understand what made the Monte Walsh character interesting enough to make a film about him. And, I found that I connected with very few of the other characters. The two bright spots for me were the roles played by David Carridine and George Eads. Both were well acted; but, not enough for me to want to see this again."
3,Tom Selleck is no Lee Marvin,"All in all, not a bad Western flick, but it surely pales next to the classic version starring Lee Marvin, Jack Palance & Jeanne Moreau."
4,Another Good Tom Selleck Movie,"It's like I said in another review I wrote about a Tom Selleck movie, ""Hey, it's a Tom Selleck movie. What else can I say?"" This one is typical of most Selleck movies, entertaining as long as you don't expect Oscar grade acting. This is another movie which should be in the collection of every Tom Selleck fan."
4,"More of a portrait, less of a traditional movie","This is not a plot-driven movie so much as it is a portrait of that moment in time when the Old West was disappearing and the men who made the Old West what it was had to adjust, die or just fade away.It is beautifully shot and there is a lot of attention to detail. If one is looking for a ton of action, this is not the western you are looking for. But, if you love cowboy movies this one is a real treat. It would make the watcher wistful for those days when the horse ruled the west, except that you know that Monte Walsh would have none of that pointless sentiment.No living actor looks more like a cowboy should than Tom Selleck and I'd be thrilled if he focused on those movies for the rest of his career."
5,This IS the America I know and love...,"Monte Walsh is a welcomed reminder that this country really did have men with fortitude and integrity. The story of course is a tragedy in the sense that an era was coming to an unfortunate end. This movie is well done and superbly acted. The Western is NOT dead - neither is the American ideal of pride in one's work, loyalty towards one's friends, and compromise is NOT worth ANY price."
4,Another classic western,"Tom Selleck again comes through with a great portrayal of aging cowboy who is seeing his way of life being squeezed and comprimised by big business. Yet, he overcomes his own trials and remains commited to do whats right and just."
2,Disappointing,"If you have read the book or have seen the original Monte Walsh movie, this one will leave you flat. It is terrible."
3,OK BUT NOT LEE MARVIN & JACK PALANCE,"I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LEE MARVIN VERSION IS NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD ... IT SIMPLY IS THE BEST. HAVE SEARCHED IN VAIN BUT COULD ONLY FIND A ""HOME MADE"" BOOTLEG COPY WHICH WAS TERRIBLE ... BAD SOUND AND WORSE PICTURE."
3,"A good Monte, but ...","The melancholy story of a passing way of life, a doomed love, and a friendship gone bad is the real star of Monte Walsh. Although Selleck, Carradine, et al do a pretty good job, overall this version can't hold a candle to the 1970 version starring Lee Marvin, Jeanne Moreau, and Jack Palance. I wish the earlier version would be released on DVD."
5,Rawhide should be on DVD. DVD please!,"I recently read that Rawhide was one of the most popular TV western series of all time. They should put the Rawhide series out on DVD. They're converting all the other old TV series out on DVD, why not Rawhide? Also, there were about 270 one hour episodes made in seven or so years. Think of the all that great western footage from the golden years of Eastwood and the Western! I saw a short clip of Rawhide on the Eastwood documentary 'Eastwood-the Man from Malpaso' , and even that brief scene was good, so you know there's some good stuff hidden in all those episodes."
4,Fun at first,"I enjoy the game, and all the options you have, but I am just not compelled to keep playing after the first few weeks. Seems to get repetitive."
4,great game,"great game, enjoyed all aspects except one, which was the Lich King story... I got pretty bored with it. other than that though, skirmish was awesome :)"
4,Will run on windows 7,Just wanted to tell every one that the games will run on windows 7. There were know problems. How ever the windows 7 compatibly center said it would not run. They were wrong. Have not played the game that much but so far is very good. You will have a problem however if you have a large screen. Another review tells you how to fix it.
2,No pause - so it's Real-Time but there isn't much Strategy,"I have no idea why anyone who produces an RTS wouldn't provide a pause key enabling you to select units reliably and issue orders. Perhaps EA do, because they didn't. Or maybe they just forgot.Sadly, although it looks okay and has the right franchise, I'm not a big fan of playing games where the key to success is picking out the right pixel to select an archer out of a scrum of two hundred scrapping soldiers. Or leaping from one battle to another with uncannily accurate clicks on a crappy minimap.If those two are either beyond you or not your idea of fun, you probably want to try the Total War series or something."
5,My kids and I love these games!,"We multiplayer with and against each other and have a blast doing it... My sons and I are huge fans of the LOTR series and these RTS games are the most enjoyed and most played in my house....... for those concerned about Vista OS compatability, we have had no issues. We solo and multi on two vista and one xp computers without any issues."
2,"Nice features, poor reliability","Purchased this for a small two person office and had good results for the first few months. Then the paper handling for the duplex feature started to fail. Using better quality paper helped but only marginally. Then the unit started to jam in the transition area consistently failing 50% of the time. Fortunately opening the back and using this secondary discharge allowed the unit to still function. The final straw what when the spring failed holding the upper platened cover. This had always been suspect since the springs are no where stong enough to support this ""lid"" but when they failed completely it just gave us the reason to find a better design. So what started off as a great SOHO AIO ended up running about 12-18 months and becoming a lemon."
2,Boring...,"I have been doing pilates for about 3 years and felt this video provided ENTIRELY too much instruction and not enough actual excercise. The instructor was incredibally boring and the video was too slow paced for me. I am not looking for a major workout or anything, but rather something to relax me but at the same time provide some fitness to help keep my body in shape and ready for L & D. Also, the beginning of the video provides a rather extensive list of warnings, most disturbing of all... this video was not designed for those who are pregnant! WHAT? I thought that was the point! At least it was only 9.99! My search will continue!"
2,It's so-so,"I did this both while pregnant and post partum. It's a little slow paced and at times boring. And we all know as a pregnant woman, we like to sneak in a nap where we can and you have opportunities to do that during this video. Would recommend looking for alternative pregnancy video's."
5,A must read for existing and future biz owners,"Finally a book written on entrepreneurship that has so much to offer! A guide for fledgling IT entrepreneurs as well as a resource for those faced with the myriad problems of the modern business environment. It is also an introduction to computer consulting and building a multimedia company. Readable, concise, precise, and pragmatic. The in-depth coverage and sound counsel make this a book that should be in every business person's library. I've read my copy twice. It's twenty-seven chapters of very good, easy-to-read inspirational reading. A must read for anyone thinking about starting or expanding their existing business. Highly recommended!"
5,Action packed classic leather stocking tale,This is the best of the movies of the leather stocking tales. The story of the siege of Fort William Henry and subsequent massacre on the military road from Lake George NY to Fort Edward is true combined with the fictionalized account of Hawheye (Nathanial Bumpers) Chingichkook and Uncas as they attempt to rescue the two daughters of Col. Monroe. In truth both of Col. Monroes daughters were killed at the fort and thrown down the fort well along with the British payroll where they remain to this very day. The fort reconstructed in the 1950's on its origional site is now a museam and my favorite place to visit. Louis R. Coletti
1,Incomplete edition,"Les pensées de Pascal sont des fragments à peine classés, et il en existe plusieurs éditions. Ici on ne sait pas de quelle édition il s'agit, et surtout il en manque la moitié. Par exemple : rien entre XVII et XXVII dans la table des matières. A éviter."
1,Received a totally different organizer,"I ordered this organizer for my mother's walker. I liked the sleek look of the product. What I got was a TOTALLY Different organizer that is green and blue and looks tacky! I claim false advertising!!!! If you didn't have this product in stock, then say so and give me the option before my credit card is charged."
4,Great shoes,"I have used these shoes for years. The one complaint I have about them is that, as is the problem with all dog shoes that I have used, they tend to turn around no matter how tight I fasten them."
1,Boots keep twisting,"I had purchased the yellow muttlucks at a local store. They took 4 months to wear out (my dog has orthopedic issues and drags her back feet).I wanted to replace the yellow ones and thought blue would be nice this time. The blue ones were different (no anti-reflective on velcro band and have a ""v"" of anti-reflective on the top of the paw. The vecro band is also larger on this set. I am very disappointed with this boot. They continue to twist around so the top is on the bottom of her foot - they already have holes in them. No matter what I try, I can't get them to stay where they should, rendering them basically useless. Not surprisingly, she has a very difficult time walking in these.They had no brand packaging which makes me wonder if these are knock-offs. I just never had the issue with the locally purchased set."
3,Decent System,"Paid $800 retail for this installed alpine has MSRP of $1000. A little difficult to learn features and setup but work decently actually got a few more radio stations on this than my stock radio and down side is the bluetooth, MP3 and USB are all on seperate modules. Not sure about the navigation but it seems from what im reading that you only can use alpines GPS systems ie Blackbird which has MP3 capabilities) Installation seems easy a few cables not included and face plates for vehicle includes 1 plate.Audio setup can be confusing and needs to be adjusted to current speaker settings."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought two of these units for my kids to use on their bus rides to school. After a couple months the skipping became terrible. The sound was never clean- maybe a function of the flimsy headphones. In any case, I'm trying to get the things serviced by the company, but it doesn't look promising. As others have said, ""Hello Sony!"""
2,Read this before you buy,"This CD player works only if you are sitting absolutely still and breathing shallow. It's heavy, large and the headphones are junk. It does produce a good sound though and I think it works much better with the ESP off rather than on. There are much better products on the market for less money."
4,Bought this for my 13 year old son - Here is his review...,"Sometimes hard to make but is nice when finishedThis shounld not be a toy that is played with, it is a model."
3,Dry but Informative,I'm simply writing this review as a college student who's got 150 pages to read a night. This book is hard to stay awake through. The author is British and the text is alot like their food - bland. But read this: the book has a ton of info if there's anything you ever wanted to know about the evolution of air warfare.
2,Disappointed Granny,I saw the words Little Tikes and just knew my grand baby would love it...the DVD had been so good. I was very disappointed. The animation didn't look as good on this DVD as it did on the original. It was like a cheap imitation. I hope they come out with another one as good as the first. I'll buy it then.
4,Very good,Very good. Very well written.Not very good in its sources (eg. full of 'based in anonymous interview...').
5,John Koehler has penetrated the Stasi,"This excellent book goes well beyond standard scholarship on the history of post World War II Germany. Mr.Koehler's research and extensive interviews (where did he find these people?!) present East Germany in a fascinating perspective, presenting new information on the GDR's role in world terrorism and its subversive efforts in the Third World. Especially gratifying is the detailed examination of the circumstances surrounding East Germany's most prominent spy in Bonn, Guenter Guillaume, and his role in bringing down the chancellorship of Willy Brandt. Mr. Koehler's account of the Soviet role in establishing the Free Jurists in West Berlin presents information that, to the best of my knowledge, has never before been published.Mr. Koehler's book is very well written. It is gripping from beginning to end and, in my view, is essential reading for anyone interested in modern German history."
1,Simply Amazing...,"It's not the content of this book that is amazing, rather it is that the author has been able to take a subject that is inherently interesting and make it seem more boring than even the dullest textbook. The book is poorly organized, full of editing errors, and lacks any kind of discernable flow. Tedious at best, I found it almost impossible to read more than three or four pages at a time, much less finish it. Many of the glowing reviews on the back of the book are from people who figure in the narrative; the rest have to be from shills who never read it. Save your money."
2,"Informative, but dull.",With all the interesting information the author still found a way to make it so dull I nearly fell asleep after each page.
5,Shocking,It really makes you question how but a few men can control an entire country with such brutal force. More amazing is the lemming like qualities of the common man. Mr. Koehler's account of the DDR's history is cut with a laser's edge.
2,"Selective, bland, dull","As an Australian who married an East German who loved her country, I found the book limited in its range, dull in its writing and very selective in its fields and viewpoint.Compared to the paranoia, security, proganda and war-like nature of the current U.S. Of A., there's not much in the book to shock or surprise. Think about the ECHELON network watching our own western lives by our own western states when your read about the STASI methods.Don't expect it to be definitive or unbiased, but it's worth reading. Also keep in mind that we in the west did our best at all times to destroy those countries in every way for 50 years."
5,The Brutality Of The Stasi Revealed At Last!,"Mr. Koehler's writing is amazing and fluid. He writes so well and brings the reader into the ministry for state security ( STASI). I love this book because the author has left no stone unturned. He describes in great detail every aspect of Stasi operations. From domestic repression in the GDR, West German and Nato espionage, all the way to Stasi operations in the third world. Who would have thought the Stasi was such a huge network. I believe this to be a most informative book that reads like a novel. It is the kind of writing that keeps you propped up on your pillow at night. I salute Mr. Koehler in uncovering the truth about the world's most efficient and notorious secret police, the Stasi. It is only by understanding the brutality of the past that we can prevent it in the future. We all need to thank Mr. Koehler for bring these injustices to the hilt."
1,"A Bland and Inaccurate ""Biography""","Out of all of the biographies I've ever read of Anne Boleyn, this is one of the worst. Denny's research is incomplete, and omits information that doesn't agree with her own views on Anne. She manages to make one of Tudor History's most fascinating and vibrant personalities bland and colorless. Not a book I would ever recommend."
1,RIDICULOUS,"Please don't buy this book. Please do not call Joanna Denny an historian. There are too many flaws to even begin to name (see other reviews below if you want a few examples). If I would have turned this book in as a paper in one of my history classes back in college, I would have easily failed the assignment. If I could have given it less than 1 star, I would have. This book should be in the fiction section of any bookstore or library."
1,Amateurish at best,"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read, and believe me, I have read many. It is poorly written, sounds like some 13-year-old thinks Anne Boleyn is the coolest thing ever and, like, everyone else is, like, WRONG!!! To Denny, everyone criticizing Boleyn is either misinformed or wasn't there or some other lame excuse. I am hardly against Anne Boleyn and I do think she has been much maligned but come on, Ms. Denny, let's attempt at least the pretense of doing proper research, shall we?"
1,Scholastically Inept,"The historical truth is stretched to the breaking point on this one. Forego this poorly researched propaganda for Peter Ives' classic work, ""The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn"".Denny makes the claim that Catholic Bishops burned bibles. No, they burned books that claimed to be bibles. Her inaccurate book should be added as kindling to the pyre."
3,Read the Ives biography,"This was an interesting biography in its interpretation and possible chronology of Henry's undated love letters to Anne. On the whole, however, Anne's complex character and motivations are lost in Denny's one-dimensional portrayal of Anne's evangelical religious piety as almost her sole raison d'etre. And, having read many Tudor histories, I wonder why Katherine of Aragon is portrayed so negatively. Surely her 20+ years of marriage and her anguish at seeing her daughter tagged as illegitimate entitles her to some compassionate understanding.Not only that, many of the more negative aspects of Anne's character are dismissed as the inventions of her Catholic enemies when her virulent tongue has been well documented by other historians.I think that this is an interesting book although it reflects too much black-and-white thinking about the major historical figures.Read Eric Ives' ""Life and Death of Anne Boleyn"" for a more well-rounded look at Anne's life."
2,"An Easy Read, but Terribly Biased....","What struck me most about this bio was the incredibly blatant anti-Catholic bias. Without exception the Catholics were portrayed as deceitful, greedy, Godless people, while Anne (who had one of the most unfair trials in the history of law) was a reformer, blameless, saintly....as a biography it was hardly objective. An author has a right to try and cast her subject in a positive light, but not at the expense of others (and of history!). You could almost put this book on the fiction shelf, as it reads like a novel. If you want a book to read on a rainy weekend, go ahead and buy it, but take it with a grain of salt. There are better bios of Anne out there."
3,A highly biased portrait,"Writers either love or hate Anne Boleyn. There is scant information about her that hasn't been destroyed like most of her portraits. Inventories of goods bought for her, love letters, and reports of Ambassadors. After she was dead, her name was not spoken in court. We have only broken fragments to reconstruct what must have been a fascinating, infuriating woman. I have always thought that Anne Boleyn aroused ( no pun intended) the desire of Henry VIII to be seen as the virtuous prince depicted by Prof David Starkey. His Queen repulsed him in her early menopause, perhaps her hygene wasn't good? Anne was a tantalizing tidbit, French to the core, a musician and dancer who was well read and knew how to flirt and withdraw. When she refused to be his mistress, he first felt disapointed, but then launched an endeavor where he could rid himself of his now useless wife and with the Pope's approval, wed a new, promising fertile new one."
1,"Awful, more supposition than fact","Having read many biographies and histories of the Tudor period I was shocked to read this book. The author makes claims that have no basis in history and which are totally based on supposition. It seeks to highlight Anne Boleyn and bash the other queens of King Henry VIII. Highly biased, don't waste you time reading it."
2,"Interesting, BUT","I found far too many errors in this book! If you are using it for a report, please check the cites!!I found Denny's views on Roman Catholic religious practice irrelevant to the history of Anne Boleyn -- other reviewers have left tons of comment regarding this. If you are doing a report for school -- BEWARE!!This is an example of the errors I found that have not been mentioned in previous reviews --On the first page of illustrations after page 246 (paperback edition) the portrait of Mary is listed as c. 1554 and her age as 38. However the background of the portrait clearly states that Mary is actually 28 years of age!! It was painted in 1543 when she was ""Lady Mary"" not when she was in her ""first year as queen""!"
5,A biography which portrays her as very literate and accomplished in her own right,"Any studying Anne Boleyn must have this new biography, which reveals the truth about not only her background but her interactions with her king and his court. ANNE BOLEYN: A NEW LIFE OF ENGLAND'S TRAGIC QUEEN something very different in the Boleyn world: a biography which portrays her as very literate and accomplished in her own right. Of special interest are insights into the politics of the Tudor court, which proved her eventual downfall as games between the old nobility and the new - and religious struggles - took place.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Read it with care,"Having been married to a Ukrainian lady for almost 3 years and having been to Ukraine several times, I would recommend caution when reading Mr. Rogers' account. There is information that is not correct, and believing every word he says can cause you a world of grief later, if you decide to pursue a Russian/Ukrainian wife.If you are really interested in learning about Russian Wives, then you are better off reading informational boards, like Brama, or Planet-Love. You'll get a wider and better balanced perspective of what it's really all about. Plus, the cost to read up to date information there is free, versus paying for out of date and sometimes incorrect information on his cd/website."
3,Weston Rogers is my Evil Twin,"I am married to a Russian woman from Kiev, Ukraine,(Yes, they are Russian there) at this time, and in doing research on an article related to travelling there again, I encountered Mr. Weston's book. I set out in some respects as Mr. Rogers did, searching through a very large pile of women for the ultimate woman, and discovered there is no perfect woman for anyone. He is too deluded about romance to give any good advice, and I found the notions expressed by the reviewers to be all accurate ones, from each of their viewpoints. Rogers wanted to exploit women more than to find real love, and it is obvious, since he is predatorily back in Kiev...."
2,Pleease!,"Agree with cool dad reviewer-this Weston Rogers is exactly the kind of man I'd despise. Men like him are looking for a pretty sex slave who is going to stay at home having babies without a complaint. Yeah, right. For any man who wants to marry a russian woman-if you are old enough to be her father, bald and unattractive-SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU! DON'T DELUDE YOURSELF! Cool Dad nailed it right on-we want someone who threats us like ladies but that doesn't mean we want someone to order us around, thank you!Weston Rogers, do yourself a favor-get your head out of your know where and see a therapist. You have some issues!"
1,Bottom Line,"By far the large majority of these so called, ""Finding my soul mate, compatible, caring, stay-at-home, cook, clean, love me,"" Russian-American, marriages are made up of two factors.The American: A middle-aged unatractive male looking for a ""soul mate"". Someone who understands him and is in love with him instantly.The Russian: A YOUNG BEAUTIFUL female looking to get out of Russia any way she can. Even if it means she will have to marry the lout.They both get what they want. The fact it never works out, Gee, who knew!"
3,Meet the Metal Man,"When the title first started rolling and I noticed how cheap and inferior the sets and special effects were, I thought I might as well not see this. But as it turns out, I wasn't bored. Sure the acting is worse than a z grade horror movie and Max 404 is the wimpiest android of them all but I was drawn to finish it out. Klaus Kinski is underused and absurd in this role, but so what? The plot concerns an android who wants to be human and some space convicts that land on the orbiting space station. The space station looks like a French disco and the music is horribly dated, but maybe that is why it looks like something to watch, keep an eye on the homage to Lang's 'Metropolis'..."
5,Awesome Movie,Man this movie brings back so many memories I have watched it over and over its just a good B movie.
4,Those Androids Are Feisty!...,"Klaus Kinski (CRAWLSPACE, VENOM) plays another oddball role as Dr. Daniel, a scientist on a deep-space station. He is assisted by his android named MAX 404. Poor MAX was supposed to get a female android ""mate"", but the whole project was shut down too soon. Now, MAX wastes his time playing video games and watching ""sexual training"" demonstration films. Meanwhile, a trio of ne'er-do-wells comes aboard, and one of them just happens to be a beautiful, human female! MAX's robo-prayers appear to have been answered! Unfortunately, for MAX and everyone else, one of the male guests is a violent psychopath. Murder and mayhem ensue, causing things to take a far darker turn than I'd expected. This was a pleasant surprise, as I happen to enjoy more twisted tales. If your tastes run toward weirder fare, then ANDROID might be a perfect fit. Oh, and the finale is a true shocker!..."
5,Better than paying money for a therapist! This book really helps!,I was looking for a self help book that would help me a mess of a relationship I was in. I didn't want to go and pay a therapist hundreds of dollars and then I came across this book. It has really helped me look at how I am living my life entangled with someone else that wasn't healthy. I highly recommend this book as it has great methods in it that I have been using to better myself. You won't be disappointed!
4,xXx Rocks the House! by Jacob Mullen,"This game rules. I bought it 5 days ago and already I love it, my brother loves it, and my best friend, who doesn't like to play gameboy, loves to watch me play it!The reviews amazon.com gives are a bit vague. When it says ""white-knuckle,"" it doesn't mean you punch/kick people. You only use ""chrome darts,"" ""super-darts,"" ""exploding darts,"" AK-47s, sawed-off shotguns, and grenades. However,on the levels where you drive the fuel-cell motorcycle, you can punch/kick the bad guys.I do not reccommend this game to anyone under 10. It is extremely violent, depicts the bad guys groaning and falling when you kill them, and shows xXx hanging by his wrists in an interrogation room when you get game over.This game is also not for beginners. It is very difficult if you are not very good.Activision rules. They did all my favorite games: Spider-Man the Movie, Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace, and X-Men: Reign of Apocalypse, and, of course, xXx."
4,terible,unlase u like running aroud with terible graphics and have super easy levelys and the fact that there arnt much in the first place the game is so boarnig there are no good fetures and overal it sucked i mean even a not color game boy game boy game would be better.I WOULD NOT GET IT!
1,Scrubber not effective,"One of the worst products I have ever purchased. Upon initial usage, low/high speed button quit working & was stuck with low speed only. Minutes later the button to spray the cleaner would not work as well. I'll be returning this one."
4,"Great for bathrooms, easy to use.","I had brought a different brand of auto scrubber prior to this one. That one was terrible to use, you had to hold down the button all the time for it to operate. This one is much more comfortable and you don't have to constantly hold down the button to make it run. It is easy to operate and changing scrubber heads takes just a few seconds. I especially like the smallest scrubber which lets you reach into the corner of the shower/tub. The only thing they could possibly improve on is having it hold more detergent. The reservoir is a little small (I think) and I have to fill it a couple of times for each tub area. I was pleased enough to buy a second one for my mom."
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"This gadget is heavy, cumbersome and has too many attachments. The pad attachments wear out quickly (after a few uses cleaning the tub) and the bristle attachments do not effectively clean grout as claimed. This product was not the answer to cleaning the grout, ceramic tile and tubs in my 52-year-old home."
4,Great Product,I like this cleaning gadget. It really does help with cleaning the bathroom. It's the best place to use this. I have the same complain most other reviewers have. That battery charge does not last long. I have 3 bathroom and I could literally only finish one before the power begins to slow down. After much research I found this particular auto cleaner to be the best one on he market. So if you are reading this Black and Decker improve the charge time.
2,Just say maybe,I'm with the E&H; Mom. If you are old or frail this is a wonderful product. If you have any type of strength I feel it is next to worthless. It doesn't have enough torque. It does a worse job than I can without it. However I certainly am not tired after cleaning the shower so that is nice.We purchased a motorcoach so we had a brand new shower (plexiglass). This device did help there because I started using it every week. But for any shower that has been around especially a fiberglass or tile shower I just don't see the util.Update: The Mister Clean pads do a much better job easier than this contraption.
2,Dissapointing,"This product is great in theory, but isn't strong enough. You still have to exert a lot of pressure, which kind of defeats the purpose of this product. I have a problem with my muscles, so I bought it hoping to lighten my load, but it really hasn't come through for me. I no longer even bother with it.Don't waste your money on it."
5,Bravo Black and Decker!! Bravo!!,As a person who absolutely detests cleaning the bathroom I must say this product was made for me!! I love-love-love this product!! I was so eager to try it that I will admit I didn't wait the full 16 charging hours recommended...After about 4 hours I couldn't stand the suspense anymore and I unplugged my scumbuster and went to work on my bathroom....Totally effortless cleaning!!! I hadn't seen my grout so clean in (I must admit) years!...It did miss a spot or two but I think that was my fault for not allowing it to fully charge...I'm sure those couple spots will be cleaned right up in the morning after I allow it to properly charge!!After purchasing the ScumBuster I don't think I'll have a problem cleaning the bathroom from now on!!All I can say is BRAVO Black and Decker!!
2,Sorely dissappointed.,"We had high expectations for this product. It scrubbed very well and did a great job that way, but the mechanism that pushes the liquid cleaning solution was broken when we got the first one. The replacement had a similar problem, so we'll just go back to good old elbow grease. Also, the plastic tab that was supposed to cover the recharge port had a tendency to fall open, not good in a wet enviroment. I'm dissapointed in Black and Decker, it seems this product needed some more real world testing."
3,Does what is advertised... But is a bit overpriced,"It does what it is advertised to do. However the price i beleive is not justified. Overall I would think 20 bucks would be right for what it does. Like any other power brush, dont expect miracles by itself, you will need a good spray or a solution to complement it. I have used it extensively in the bath rooms and it worked fine, although it needed a few recharges. And for saftey reasons associated with electric shock, you cannot use this while its plugged in for charging. I paid 40 bucks for this item, I am giving 3 stars because it does not represent value for money, I would give 5 stars for a price in the range of 20-25."
3,Take it or leave it,"I recently purchased the ScumBuster S600 because I figured if anything could get our showers looking clean, this would be it. I read all the instructions, excitedly filled the cleaning reservoir, and got to work. First, the cleaner leaked out as it was spraying. Second, it ran out of cleaner even before I finished spraying the walls. Third, I still had to use some force in order to get the scum off the walls, floor, and shower door. Last, it became quite heavy by the end of the job (and that was just one bathroom). My conclusion is this: If you're looking for a magical cleaning machine, keep looking. However, if you just want a neat gadget to help you out, this product is for you."
1,great until the battery pack dies-can't replace,This worked great for about 2 years. Then it wouldn't hold a charge and found out the battery pack can't be replaced. Wa-hoo...so I have a gadget that has no power...but lots of accessories that I am guessing won't fit on the other models.I wrote to B&D; and they didn't even reply!! NICE! I wouldn't spend 50.00 again....I am looking to see if the other models use the same accessories...but I doubt it. I am tired of products with planned deaths!
2,The old ScumBuster model is better,"I decided to upgrade my old scumbuster with this one and am I sorry I wasted my money.I do not like the fact that you have to plug this one into the wall to charge it. The old one just had you swap out the power cell and you were good to go for another half hour of cleaning.I also dislike the solution dispenser. After using it once, I know I will never use it again. It is awkward and fiddly and messy and takes up too much time. Plus it makes the unit heavier and harder to maneuver.The one feature I do like is the variable speeds, that is a useful thing.The brushes and attachments are not especially new or different or improved from the old unit. The storage case is a joke - it is just the package it came in... what's up with calling it a storage caddy and listing it as a product feature?I would not have bought this if I had to do it over again.Please B&D...; bring back the ""classic"" scumbuster - it was better in so many ways!"
3,Weak,"The scrubber operates at a very low speed, and the battery doesn't last long. You will wish that Black and Decker had made this device more powerful.Also it leaves behind a lot of water/cleaner since it spins and there is no absorbancy on any of the attachments.I'm happy I bought it, but it doesn't replace anything in my cleaning cupboard which was my original intent."
2,Surprisingly underpowered!,"I am genuinely disappointed with this product. I really thought that being made by Black & Decker this product would have some serious power behind it, it doesn't. Also, the attachment that lets the brush heads ""flex"" looks in the add like a ball joint, it isn't. It is a hard foam extension that has almost no give to it at all. I can't get into corners like the add promised which is a real shame. It isn't completely useless, but it certainly isn't what the advertisments led me to believe it would be. If I had know what I know now, I would not have wasted my money on it!"
1,had to throw it out after less then 6 months,Bought this as a replacement for the one I previously had for several years. This product worked great for the first few months. Noticed it would not hold a charge for very long. Tried to return it but was told it was over the time to do so. Was really dissappointed with this replacement. Loved my first one.
2,Slow and weak,"If you have to scrub a large area that won't be too hard to clean, this is fine. If it's going to take some elbow grease, this just isn't up to the job. It's slow, lacks power, so you can't exert enough force to get off tough messes. Certainly useless for something like a grill. Fine for soap scum."
2,No Battery Life - almost useless,"Fully charged this little ditty only runs for 15 minutes, if that. If you use high speed, it runs even less. Even though charged and rarely used, high speed finally stopped working all together. I really thought this was better than sliced bread when first purchased, came with lots of nice attachements that switch quickly. Now I would not recommend this device at all. Try elbow grease and a Mr.Clean Magic scrubber."
2,Broken button,"We got this and still use it, but speed ""2"" no longer works. This was less than a year before the button broke. It worked nicely when this, the faster speed, was working. Now we still use it but it is not as effective."
5,Wonderful Product - Black and Decker S600 Cordless Scrubber,What a wonderful product - easy to use and works so well. Used it in my bathrooms which I felt cleaned efficiently and easily.
2,Not so great,"I read all the reviews and there was one bad one - I thought since the majority thought it was a great item, I couldn't go wrong. Nope - really doesn't work that great - doesn't do anything an abrasive scrubber couldn't do."
1,Not worth the money,I could do better cleaning with an old scrub brush. What an expensive joke. A total waste of the money.
4,scrubs better than i do,"although i have not used this product a lot yet, so far i love it...the big test will be to see if it can get the waterline off the toilet bowl but since it is submersible i do not see why it will not do the job... if anything can in our hard water area...am sure it will do better than i could do by hand"
1,Disappointed!,"I bought the original scumbuster years ago. It worked so well, I told everyone about it. I couldn't stop spreading my excitement over this powerful tool. Well, guess B&D just can't make them like they used to. Every scumbuster after my original, including this model, has been a big disappointment. Not powerful enough. If I apply alittle pressure, the machine nearly stops. Way to weak and SLOW!"
2,There are some performance issues,After reading the largely pro reviews of this product (on amazon.com)I purchased The Black & Decker Scum Buster.Well don't believe the hype.There is in my view a glitch particularily with the 2nd speed mode which rarely works the way it is supposed to.I am sending mine to a service center.By the way the young lady who answered the 1800-544-6986 was borderline rude with little customer service savvy.The Scum Buster is not powerfull enough for my gritty tub.....
5,Satisfied customer,"I am a resident manager at a senior property in Oak Creek, Wi and I found it handy for me to use in the vacant apartment turnovers. I thought I had a problem with the sprayer not working, but I went to the instructions and found the tool to unclog the sprayer, so I am in business again.Gloria Johns"
1,"Don't waste your money, unless you have NO strength...","First, this has awful scrubbing power. And it's such a small sized scrubber, it isn't very useful in the tub or shower.Also, mine leaked and eventually (after about 6 small uses) actually BURNT out...smoke & all.A hazard, useless, a waste of money!"
3,Great scrubber.,Just got a new Yorkie puppy who is indescriminate about where to go potty. I was using Nature's Miracle and an old washcloth to clean up. This is creat for carpet. My only complaint is that the liquid resevoir is too small and only hold about four onces of cleaner. It is a pain to continually refill.
4,Great Product,I have one of Black and Decker scrub brushers. Big brush is the same. But on this one they included an attachment to use the pads. The motor is powerful but fast speed could go a little faster for me. The pads are like plastic steel wool and really do the trick... cleans my tub in like 2 min without effort.
2,powerscrubber,"I was less than impressed. The resevoir that holds the cleaning fluid leaked out all over the place and I still had to use a cleaning rag to wipe up all of the streaks and puddles of cleaning fluid. I can get the same result by spraying the cleaning fluid straight out of the bottle it came in, let it sit and wipe it up with a cleaning rag, no powerscrubber needed!"
2,scrubber,This item is not powerful enough. I really thought it would do a better job of cleaning. The squirter got clogged after one use and did not deliver enough liquid.
1,Lifts closer to 30 pounds,"This would be a great magnet if it promised to lift only 30 pounds. However, I just received this product and after testing, found that it is not strong enough to lift any pieces of metal heavier than 25 or 30 pounds."
5,THE MUSIC THAT TOUCHES YOUR SOUL,"Tom Toth has a hit once again. The music contained in ""Good News From Outer Space"" contains sentiments that have touched all of us deeply from time to time in our lives. It is the music of the 60's that brings you peace and also inspires you to live and to love. It brings comfort and joy and it lets you know that there are still musical artists in this world whose music is for ""real"" people who lead real lives. How I love it and how I always anticipate a new Tom Toth release and/or live show. You're the greatest, Tom!!!!!! Thanks to Bohemian Embassy for producing this wonderful artist."
4,Great info!,"This book made me want to take a year off of work and go to each and every historical site in Britain. I'm still trying to get my hands on the BBC History Channel television series as this book was written as its companion.--Vicki Landes, author of ""Europe for the Senses - A Photographic Journal"""
2,Just an ok microscope.,This was a christmas gift for my almost 5 year old son..... it's a pretty chintzy PLASTIC microscope. Next time I'll spend more money and get a better quality microscope.
1,Does not work properly,"If you want a good, functional microscope do not by this one. Spend the extra money and buy a quality microscope. This microscope is extremely cheap. The only thing that you can see is a reflection of your eyelashes. Don't waste your money."
1,Buylletsd of Rain,"I bought this book based on the reviews on this page.I couldn't have been more disappointed. If this is suspense to those readers, we have been reading different books.Boring! The guy has some kind of sex 4 times by page 88, not very suspenseful.Boring."
4,Polo Urias,"Este CD si esta con toda *!@#. me gusta bailar nortenas y este si es un CD para bailar toda la noche.... Saludos a toda mi gente de Coahuila desde aqui en Germany!!!! y a mi gente aya en casa en fort worth, texas"
5,Fascinating treatment which answers many questions,"Be forewarned - even the most avid students of the Tudor era will find that many of their notions are challenged. The work is overwhelming in its intriguing detail, fleshing out the entire picture of English medieval devotion as well as social conditions, and the impact of certain negative aspects of the Reformation that many of us would prefer not to consider.Challenging and enriching as a work of history, the Stripping of the Altars also will cause the devout to ponder many a point. This is no ""light read"" - but the time and attention it takes to get through this actually quite readable work will not be stressful, because it is so totally engrossing. Put this on the shelf of anyone who wishes to fulfil the Anglican exhortation to have an inquiring mind."
5,The stripping of the altars,This book is a masterpice in reference to traditional catholicism in ingland before the reformation. Any one who is not convince as to how deep Traditional Catholisism was in England shuold read this book. I enjoyed it from begining to end.
2,Sounded Great... Till it broke,"This stereo Sounded Great until one day a channel stopped working. I was upset but my 3 month warranty was just up. Ok. Fine. At least I still have one channel and the Super Woofer left. Until today when they both quit working on me. Now I have to work in silence. I work in construction so the radio had some wear and tear, but I was very careful with it. This radio lasted the shortest length of time than any radio I have ever bought."
3,Good buy but beware.,"It is vary cool looking and the supper woofer is nice. But it takes way to many batteries for my taste (10 D’s for exact) if you are going to buy batteries buy rechargeable. The CD player has no shuffle (which I like). Note that the right supper woofer is [not real], (trust me I took it apart to see why it was not working its a plastic molding to look like one. I was upset and that is why I gave it 3*'s). Besides that I use it for roller hockey, it puts out a good LOUDE sound with nice quality and bass. (It takes stray shots fairly good with little skipping)."
4,2k Has Nothing On This Game,"After playing this game I can say for sure that there is no reason to buy 2k's baseball game if you own a PS3 (or even a PS2 for that matter). The graphics on this are so much better on the PS3 than 2k7 and gameplay is so much more natural. If you've played this on PS2, the PS3 version plays exactly the same so there is no transition to worry about. I can say for sure that this is the best baseball game on the market."
2,On Line Play is GARABAGE!,"Between this and 2K7 Baseball this is by far the better game. However, Sony's online play is the worst I've ever seen. Traffic delays and dropped games are the norm. In fact, I've tried playing online a dozen times since I bought the game when it was first released and have yet to finish a single, nine inning game without the Sony server dropping the game.Upon first release, Sony issued a press release saying they were working on the problem. Two months later and it's just as bad as the first day it hit the market. GARBAGE! By far the worst on line experience of any game I've ever played.With friends located all over the country we all bought this to play on line together and can't. It's a $60 game that isn't worth two cents online."
3,It's alright.,"It's pretty fun. Bit confusing till you get use to it. There are better baseball games out there, but this one is pretty fun, especially for the price!"
3,pretty good,i like this game im a little dissapointed that a few players are missing but it's a good game
4,Best Baseball Game for ps3,"i initially bought 2k7 for the flashy graphics- but the horrendous framerate and joe morgan drove me away.thank goodness this is available til the next MVP game arrives. the pitching is challenging and the batting interface is excellent. the guess pitch system makes for good, patient ABs - you might actually take a walk a couple times a game, which generally doesn't happen in video game baseball. as a pitcher you need to take care- pitches will not go exactly where you want them to. you won't be throwing no hitters right off the bat- again, another refreshing element to a baseball sim."
4,Can't Wait for Next Year's Version!,"I don't mean that as a knock on this game, it is a compliment. This year's game was very good and was only the first next gen offering, so I can imagine how next year's will be. I just recently purchased a PS3 and this was the first game on my radar. I've been playing MLB 2K7 on the 360 until this point. Overall, this game is definitely superior. The gameplay is excellent. The presentation is very good, much like a TV broadcast. I think I was most surprised by the quality of the presentation. The graphics are certainly not as pretty as 2K7, but the animations are better and again, this is only their first next gen attempt. There are some glitches, but that is to be expected and none are so bad that they ruin the experience. At least none that I have encountered. Overall I highly recommend this game!"
4,No Contest,"I had left a review for MLB 2k7 also and everything that I said and everything that I expected for this version of The Show held true. I can't review the game for itself becuase different people have different preferences. However in comparison to it's compititon, there is no contest. Just as I had said in the other review, the biggest different that you will notice is the gameplay and it is absolutely awsome. Crystal clear graphics (which 2k7 has also) are a factor, but the smooth gameplay and realistic movements of the fielders, especially the pitchers is the biggest difference. The only complaint that I personally have is the new style of baserunning but you can switch that back to classic in game settings. No need to rent, just buy this outright it is fantastic."
4,Remembering Mog by Colby Rodowsky,"Annie is finishing high school and has reached the point in her life that her sister, Mog, had reached when she was killed. Annie struggles with how she will go forward without having Mog's footprints to follow. She has trouble finding the comfort and support that she needs from her family. However, she is able to deal with her thoughts and fears as she reaches out to Harriet Jeffers, a therapist. I thought the book was great. Rodowsky does a fabulous job describing the feelings and thoughts of the characters. It was very easy to get interested in, and I felt like I knew the characters personally. It has a genuine feel for how one can handle grief so differently from others. NOTE TO TEACHERS: This is an ALA Notable Book and would be appropriate for middle school or high school students."
4,Remebering Mog,"Annie must come to grips with the loss of her older sister and her mother's denial that Mog is gone. Finally, a book for young adults that is not hopeless and dreadful. Real issues, real struggles, real people yet ""Dysfunctional Families in their Various and Nefarious Forms"" isn't the theme of the book."
5,Get Organized!,"After receiving Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 for Christmas, I immediately went searching for a book to get me started. I previously had only used the software that came with my camera for importing and editing my digital photos.I first purchased an ""official"" Adobe Photoshop classroom book, but as it was structured like a tutorial, I did not find it very accessible. So I went searching again, and found ""Organize your photos with Adobe Photoshop Elements 3"" by Michael Slater. Needless to say, the other book was returned to the bookstore!I've read the first four chapters so far--and just starting thenext. It's very readable--and understandable--even before having a chance to look at or ""play"" with the program. The text and screen prints are very user friendly. I could not be more pleased with this book."
5,my favorite book of all time,this book is my favorite book of all time. the subject matter is simple but the but the style of the writing is amazing and keeps your interest. the book is about a man who works and lives in a library and has lived there for a few years. the books contained in the library are written by random people who drop the books off when they are finished writing them. eventualy the character meets a beautiful insecure woman who he falls in love with. she later becomes pregnant and they end up on a trip to mexico to get an abortion.i know it does not sound that exciting but i swear the writing and the characters make the book truely enjoyable.
1,How did this even get published?,"This book is one of the most god-awful pieces of ""literature"" that I have ever laid eyes on. I would really like to have a serious heart-to-heart with anyone who gave this thing over one star. This guy just pukes out the weirdest, most ill-fitting similies and metaphors (not to mention he's a ridiculous sexist pig).An under-achieving 5th grader taking his first creative writing course could do better than this. I mean, c'mon...just read this line: ""Her stomach was so unbelievably thin that it was genius and I wondered how there could be enough intestines in there to digest any food larger than cookies or berries.""Dude. Lay off the LSD. Seriously. You're hurting your brain."
2,God save us from Janet and Mark,"I'm giving this two stars only because these books really can teach children to read, which supposedly was their main purpose. I learned to read on them and hated Janet and Mark, particularly Janet. (My name is Janet, which didn't help.) If you need more reasons, check out this very telling review dated September 3, 1970 -- the day before my 6th birthday, which would be exactly the time I was being ""indoctrinated"" with these two kids and their Stepford wife of a mother. [...]"
5,Awesome Racing Experience,"I'm using this with the Xbox 360 wireless wheel. I was a little worried at first after reading how some people had to figure out ways to bolt theirs in. But it turned out to be a non-issue. The supplied velcro straps do a great job of keeping the wheel and pedals in place. I used most of it on the wheel and a few small pieces on the pedals. I think they expect you to brake with your left foot because the pedal base is centered, but I just can't drive that way. So I set the pedals about 4 inches off of the platform and it's not a problem.The seat is very comfortable and the whole thing is very sturdy. It slides across my carpet like it weighs 2 pounds. It's pretty cool looking too, so I'm just going to keep it in my living room permanently(with no argument from my girlfriend!) The force feedback of the wheel seems like it's doubled with this thing. Dirt was a blast to play, as was Pgr 4 and Forza 2. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
2,"Donovan ""Gamer"" review is spot on","For me, the seat is just unbearable. Nothing about it is comfortable. And the constant squeaky noise created by the springs are very irritating. Most importantly, I just cannot find a position to my liking due to restriction in adjustments. ie. I may like the steering position, but it will get in way of my footwork, and it goes on and on chasing for that right combo you can't create unless you do some serious modification. Simply, the seat is awfull and so nothing will work henceforth imo. I suggest you avoid this and look for others."
4,Love it,"This seat is great, the quality of this product is great. Comfortable seat, well manufactured, the steering wheel and peddle bars can be adjusted to almost any size user. My only complaint is the base stand could use a little more stability for heaver drivers."
4,Nice Gaming Seat,"Nice comfy chair, easy to assemble. Took a bit to mount the Xbox 360 wireless steering wheel (velcro wasn't enough). Adjustments are easy when changing from one person to the next."
5,"Great quality, good value","Love it. The chair itself exceeds my expectations, offering a well-made, extremely comfortable place to rest while playing games. The frame is fully adjustable, and pretty stable once the knobs are tightened, providing a great platform for mounting your favorite racing wheel. In my opinion, other is no way to fully appreciate a racing wheel and pedals without this rig. Being a bit of a DIY guy, I though about building my own chair before purchasing one, but for the price, quality, and ease of assembly, you can't beat a Playseat!"
3,Awesome! whole new way of gaming,"It looks as good as it seems! Adds a whole new experience when gaming. Love the feel of steering and accelerating now with the Playseat Evolution. I think its over priced for what it does. Its only a seat but then again it looks awesome. Only problem I had was the cushion on the seat was bent in the box which left a mark on it. It might be picky but then again I am paying $300 dollars for a seat thats not even leather! I had no problem putting it together even though the box didnt come with instructions, although some people might find it hard to. Therefore I did not give it 5 stars. The seat is necessary if you own a steering wheel for any console but the price is over rated for its purpose. I might add aswell, the box came with all the screws needed but they should put atleast 2 more extra."
5,Amazing!!,Any serious racing fans must have this playseat. i spent an easy of 2 hours in it without even knowing 2 hours went by.Prior to this it was painful to attach the steering to coffee table and try and play on a low seat and I used to get frustrated by that. Awesome product. Thanks Amazon as always for the best price around.
3,Chair is great !,"Chair and assembly is generally very good, the only drawback is the foot mount for the pedals, they don't hold the pedals in place very well even when tightened, you have to use other measures"
5,Just Awesome,"Bought two of these seats to race my 10 year old son with his old PS2 and new XBox 360 games. Both racing wheels fit nicely and seats adjust fine for me 6'3"" and my son 5'. Changing steering wheels is tedious because of the wires but the seats are incredibly great. I still can't drive a virtual car as well as my son but using a steering wheel I can at least compete. Has been great father son time indoors now that its 20 degrees outside. Buying two seats seemed expensive till my wife reminded me of the cost of the XBox originally. Solid construction and they fold and dissasemble partially for storage in a closet. they get an A+ in my book."
4,This is Great! but theres some Flaws..,"i ordered from amazon, and got it really fast. thank you amazon people. this playseat evolution is awesome. comfortable, easy to put away. BUT!, you see the black spin knobs? when you tighten them, they create holes, scratches, dents on the bottom pole connecter, they should've put rubber bottoms on the spin knobs or something so it won't damage the product. also they should've add something on the bottom of the metals so it won't scratch your floor. other than that, its a great product."
4,Fantastic Design and Easy to shift around,I use it for both my PC and PS3 in my Entertainment room and shift between them easily. Seats can be bent down for storage. I use it with a G25 and hoped that I would Find a Shifter extension but couldn't find it here in Amazon. It should have come with the product. Overall I am satisfied.
4,This thing is fun!,Bought this after buying the Logitech G25 wheel. The shift plate wasn't available so I had to order that from another website. The center post for the wheel gets a little annoying when working the pedals but otherwise a fun product. *NOTE* I also use this for my Saitek X52 and the shift plate works great for the throttle (you can switch the sides the plate is mounted quickly and easily)
4,A bit expensive but worth it,"The racing seat makes racing games more fun. Beats using a controller. Fit and finish is nice. After 7 months of use, just a little fade on the steering wheel leg support. Seat is confortable, played 12hrs straight no problem. I agree with the other reviews about the bar between your legs getting in the way. Also the angle of the pedal mount is a bit steep, I prefer less angle. Putting this thing together took me less than 1hr. Bought the shifter holder and the slider. After putting it together, it felt solid. Mounted the steering wheel and pedals, I was ready to go. Checkout my video on youtube and search 989surfer. My video has the playseat mounted on a custom chassis and tv stand. No tripping or stumbling on exposed wires. I will be making a custom wheel holder, bar less between legs. Overall this is a good racing seat but with some flaws. With some customization, this can be the best racing seat."
5,Outstanding,"Works great, much better than anything I have ever built for myself. Great for 200+ heavy/large guys like myself."
2,Poor Quality Control,"As a fan of racing sims, my Playseats classic/Logitech Driving Force Pro combo has seen a lot of use. So, when I wanted to upgrade, the obvious choice was a Playseats Evolution and Logitech G25 (a popular combo here, it seems). The Evolution seems to be designed for the G25 - everything fit together beautifully, with much less wobble than the classic, and Playseats helpfully includes bolts for the wheel and pedals to eliminate wobble there as well.However, I can't put the seat together, because someone at the factory broke off a drill bit while threading one of the holes - then decided to leave it there. I now have a nicely powder-coated fragment of drill bit that can't be removed. The seat is nothing but a pile of parts until I figure out how to get a replacement post. There's no phone number in the box, and their website lists contact info in the Netherlands.This seems like an improvement on its predecessor in every way - but thanks to poor quality control, I wouldn't know."
5,Buy this if you are a CSN fan or just love great vocal music,"Why these guys aren't more well known I do not know! I live near Venice where they used to play a lot, and yet I didn't even hear much about them here! They seem to have NO record company promotion at all, and it's a shame.I suppose it's because their ""sound"" is not the crap that is popular these days, it's more like Crosby Stills and Nash and the Eagles, but they are fantastic!Their version of Guinevere is the best version I've ever heard, even better than Crosby Stills and Nash's own version! (And Crosby helps them out on their version here.) It also features a track by and with Jackson Browne.This band makes just plain great music and if you love great vocals, you will love it. And by the way, their songwriting is great, too."
4,Venice has the best harmonies!,An example of truely talented musicians! The recording quality is not great but the conten makes up for it.
5,Get you a pair of these Hogue grips,If you're shooting .38's in your .357 stock grips will be fine but when you start shooting those hot .357 magnum loads you'll wish you had these grips. Great griping action and lowers recoil.
4,Apex is almost there...,"I took the chance with the 3 cd version. I had read the feedback in forums such as this and knew that some folks have had bad experiences, but decided to take the plunge anyway, primarily for the MP3 capability. I am pleased to report that it has played everthing I have put into it without a problem (DVD, audio and MP3). My criticisms: a) needs eject on remote, b) audio shuffle should shuffle between cds (not just within one) and c) the shuffle should work with MP3 - - now it plays stuff in order only. Apex has proven that there is demand for what they've produced, simply needs more refinement. I will replace it when such a product is available. In the meantime, it gets the job done..."
3,Book for a beginning poker player,"I am a casual poker player. Play in local events. But rarely for money.The book by Andy Nelson, ""Poker Hold'em book one"" is in my opinion for the beginner. It has good information. I read this book in about an hour.He lays out which hands to play in early position, middle position and late position. Talks about the benefits of position, and how it can impact your ability to play certain hands. Andy covers defending your blinds, and when it is better to fold and defend another hand.I liked the chapter on ""Copying Bad Players"". How many times have you seen players win with hands that should not have even been played.If you are new to Hold'em, this is a quick read on the basics and what hands are high percentage winners. And most importantly, it explains how position can affect you even when you have pocket Aces."
3,"Only a so-so solution, but I haven't found anything much better","I got this to hold my cellphone ad a few other items while rolling around. It has a tendency to drift along the frame tube, so I interlaced the uppermost straps with those from my seat cushion. It's too small to hold my wallet and cellphone together, but big enough that the phone falls sideways to the bottom and can be difficult to retrieve in a hurry (and I'm rather dexterous).So, especially considering it's not expensive, I guess it's the best solution for now."
4,Scaredy Cat,This story is great for the pre-k age group. My daughter was delighted with the amusing tale and the manner in which it is told. She can listen to it over and over again!
4,"CONVERSE LIKE CAGNEY, 101 ... AND BE ON TOP O' THE WORLD","Getting an education in tough guys and bad behavior doesn't get more retro than this. This is a set of flashcards, each featuring a famous one-liner and movie still from all the classic gangster flicks. Fatten up on the skinny on the films and you'll be on top of the world, you dirty rat!"
2,Polarizing Lens does not work on a Digital Camera,"I purchased the kit and was so happy till I tried to use the Polarizing lens. It would not work on my Canon Powershot S5IS digital camera. It seems that there are two types of polarizing filters available -- linear and circular. I found out to my dismay when I went to my local camera store that for a digital camera, I needed a Circular polarizing lens. This is not the type of polarizing lens that the kit had that I purchased. So, buyer beware!!!"
5,Great for home or school,"I have this collection and collection 1 and both are invaluable at home with my son who is 10 and likes to ""play"" in the DVD and for school in my Kindergarten class. Read the books to your children first and see how excited they get when they can watch the book. The addition of great readers and music really brings the stories alive. But remember, they don't take the place of you reading to your child every night!"
3,Small and valves are paper and thread,"This model is smaller than I thought which I guess is my own fault for not reading in detail. The outside is nice looking. The tricuspid and mitral valves are poor, however, and I'm using this for a valves project. These valves are made out of what looks like folded paper and the chordae are already unglued. I'd call this a $20 model."
4,INSPIRATIONAL!,I found the collection of Black leaders & inventors very inspiring. This author has created a unique way of teaching this complicated topic. Good job!
1,More than just a language barrier.,"Do yourself a favour and read the introduction, or really any part of it, before plonking down your hard-earned money. Thank God I could return it."
3,Decent Read But Totally Unlovecraftian,"The author's style doesn't bother me much, the plot made sense and even involved me a little, and the romance was amusing, bordering on titillating. However, as usual, the author has adopted the Derlethian heresy of good vs. evil, meaning that the story cannot be lovecraftian in any way."
2,Not a satisfying read,"My experience with this book was frustrating. I knew not to expect a traditional Lovecraft story, but was still unsatisfied. The characters came across as fake and soulless, while their dialogue and actions sometimes made no sense. The characters motivations seemed to materialize out of thin air, all of which did not help me to relate to the characters at all.The story itself was less interesting than one would hope for with such a promising premise. The introduction really captured my imagination, but once we join the main characters, disappointment ensues. I found myself pushing through most pages, giving the author the benefit of the doubt until Ulysses and Cybele finished their adventure. I did appreciate attempts to mix Greek mythology with the Cthulhu universe, but overall, I feel dumber for having read this book."
4,Another wonderful collection by Ms. Nelson!,"I read and loved The Expendables and Female Trouble and couldn't wait to read another Antonya Nelson short-story collection. In the Land of Men is another collection centered on women and their relationships. Nelson's prose has a rather simplistic feel to it, but her stories have beautiful, thought-provoking messages within. This collection is quite similar to Female Trouble in that the main characters are all women dealing with their spouses, siblings, lovers, and themselves. My favorite stories are ""Inertia,"" ""How Much We Could See,"" ""Fire Season,"" and ""The Happy Day."" I enjoy Nelson's collections of short stories. They are almost as good as Joyce Carol Oates's offerings. She is in my must-read list of authors. I recommend In the Land of Men most highly."
5,Must have guide to pregnancy,I loved this book. It was one of the first books that tells the reader the types of foods recommended by trimester. Extremely helpful.
2,Interesting; Not Great,"The movie is a fairly faithful rendition of Shakespeare's Richard II, including most of its text, and done in roughly fourteenth century costumes. Birney, playing Richard II, is best in the early acts. The introspective force of Richard in the later acts is not well conveyed. Bolingbroke is downplayed. The most powerful acting is in the parts of Gaunt, Mowbray, and Northumberland, who is wonderfully (and appropriately) scary.I recommend this video to help people studying the play get a quick good sense of what is going on in Richard II, and help them over any language difficulties in the written text.I do not think this is a great performance. I have heard there is a version with John Gielgud as Gaunt which is supposed to be great, but I have been unable to find it."
5,Geology of National Parks,"Perfect, great condition, just what I needed. Great seller, fast shipping. I would recommend to others."
4,"geology of national parks text book, no highlights at all","the book came nice and clean, no creases and no highlights, very happy with my purchase"
4,"Book good, not great","The provided great geologic information. The colorplates of the parks were nice, but it would be better if the whole book was in color, and if they had pictures of all the parks. A good buy if your intrested in National Parks or geology."
1,arch groomer,"I purchased this product a number of months ago - while putting it together one side broke. I emailed the company and they asked for my address to send another (I expected to pay for it). It never arrived, and I emailed them again - an excuse was made and asked for my address again.They never mailed the item - never asked for prepayment, etc."
4,Cat Digs this,"My girlfriend's cat isn't much for toys but she likes rubbing her face into pretty much anything, she likes this and scratches her paws on the rug, some people are not so sure about the shape of the base, but... it works."
4,Cat scratcher,"I gave this to my Sister for her kitties. They didn't want anything to do with it at first, but then warmed up to it. They use it off and on. You know cats...very picky."
4,A Great Biography about a Man who wants no Publicity,"This is a great historical review of his life and music with many facts to learn. I recently attended a small political fundraiser where Jackson Browne and J. D. Souther played a few songs in the living room of a home. Having always loved his music particularly his newer album, ""the Naked Ride Home"", I bought this book to learn more about this complicated man and this book does not disappoint. My one complaint is the packaging of the book. This is not a typical book size but rather like a large song book. And, with the ""cheesy"" cover art, not the kind of book you want to travel with. That aside, if you want to learn as much as you can about the very private Jackson Browne, this is the bible and I recommend it."
3,"An ""Unauthorized"" Story of a HoldOut","This book was entertaining. Who is to say that it has genuine, true facts if Jackson Browne did not give authorization of this book."
5,Giving it as a gift this Christmas,"I have this CD and absolutely love it. Super mellow, FANTASTIC for my morning meditations. This is truly a beautiful piece of art. I adore it so much I am getting this for my Aunt for Christmas (I also am gettingMisty Forest MorningandMusic of the Tarot) she is going to be thrilled!"
4,"If you've played NBA Streets before, then you already know what to expect","Just as the title says, this is a straight forward NBA Streets game. Nothing really new or groundbreaking is introduce here. Don't get me wrong, I loved playing this game and I am highly recommending it to any hardcore Streets fans. Just don't expect there to be any new feature that are jaw dropping."
4,Remember NBA Jam?,This game is a lot of fun .. kind of like an NBA Jam for the new generation of gamers. It's NOT meant to be a life like simulation at all. It's supposed to be an exaggerated representation of schoolyard ball and it does it well. It might be a little short and I can't speak to the replay value as I have yet to try it on Live. Overall though I've enjoyed it so far.
3,Fun but lacking,"This game was very fun! I was able to unlock every achievement in one afternoon, except for the online ones, because no one was playing... haha If your looking for a quick 900 odd points this is a good game. Its fun, but lacking great graphics and no real story line, but I didn't expect it from a basketball game either!"
1,A step backward for the franchise,"I am an avid NBA Street fan. From the original to what it has become today, I had always enjoyed the arcade style basketball game. But immediately after playing Street Homecourt a blaring flaw in the game emerged. WHY ON EARTH CAN YOU BLOCK EVERYTHING?! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY SHOOT A JUMP SHOT?! This game sucks on so many levels. The fact that anything and everything can and WILL be blocked makes for matches against any experienced Street player an exchange of blocks and a tireless effort to try to get at least one basket to count. Sure you can dunk the ball but you shouldnt have to resort to that for each and every point. If you like Street 2 or 3 I highly recommend you stay away from this game. DONT BUY THIS TERRIBLE GAME!"
2,Nice Enough but Fragile,"The shirt is made of a nice, heavy satin material, but the seams simply aren't reinforced well enough for wear. I think I'd had it on for ten minutes when I ripped a shoulder seam. Be very careful with it and it might survive the party."
4,what can I say.....,unless you are in the field this would be the most boring and useless book on the planet - but I am so it comes in handy
3,Misleading ad,The item itself is great; but I thought I was buying a set per the picture. Watch out and buy carefully.
1,nice - but you only get one piece,The picture makes you think that you will receive 1 set - but you will only get one screw pilot.
5,The Best!,These starters mean I don't use kindling and no paper. Work every time. Just be sure to follow the instructions and place the dome upside-down so the flat part is on top.
4,I like this starter.,Notice I said like not love. They need to be bigger for longer burn time and larger flame. Otherwise they light easy and once in a while they get the fire started
3,"Big, but work","Originally got these for alternative fire starting assistance for the long term bag, but, they were bigger then I expected, so, they go into the camping trailer. They work, and I love the smell of saw dust, so I won't complain to bad, but that's all it is, compressed saw dust with wax."
3,Nuggets,"Nuggets work great, but you have to use so many of them. Also, after shipping, there were a lot of them that were just crumbs.All in all, a great gift idea."
3,There are better products out there,"I bought these firestarters becuase I got a free sample with my new fireplace insert. They work OK, and they burn for the length of time intended. However, you rarely can start a good fire without using a few of them, or without using plenty of kindling along with them. I prefer Fatwood becuase it burns hotter and longer, and it smells good.Overall, the lightning nuggets are decent - but you need to use a few to get a good fire going if you're not using kindling."
3,Reasonable,"I have a large home that I heat with a fireplace. The fireplace is connected to the duct work in the house, so the fireplace is our primary source of heat in the winter. Needless to say, we start lots of fires.We purchased these and found that they did work, but that it required 5 or 6 of them to get the fire started.In the end, we found a better solution is the fatwood sticks. Those have lots of oil in them and more easily and reliably start a fire."
3,They will do,"I guess I am too used to the Kindle Candle from Yankee Candle. The candle seems to start faster and hotter.......and you don't have to worry if it is upside down, sideways or right-side up........and, the candle seems to last a little longer. Will still use the nuggets ......and guess the ""jury is still out"" on these for now. Guess too early in the woodstove season to rule out. (Will follow-up)."
5,Seek Seeker,My mother gave me this book as a gift. It is a marvellous intro to the cards. I am 21 and am very interested in mystical topics. Ms. Pollack is a major leader in tarot and writes a book that is totally approachable. She is a sweet soul who cares about her readers. I plan to buy her books 'Forest Of Souls' and 'The Kabbalah Tree.
3,I Valiant Early Attempt,"Her latter work regarding the Tarot and the Kaballah is sooooooooooooooooooooo much better! I like Ms. Pollack very, Very, VERY much!!!***Her _Forest Of Souls: A Walk Through the Tarot_ Sep 1, 2002 is an incredibly novel work regarding the Tarot and--more importantly, I think--where the Tarot is GOING . . . Very awakening and insightful!"
1,Tales from the Cannibal side,Actually this movie does not even deserve 1 star but that was the lowest rating you could give. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Please buyer beware!! This movie should not even be categorized as a b-movie. It was an F movie.
4,More praise for the Garmin 478,I agree completely with the other reviews. I can't imagine navigating the shallow coastal Florida waters without a unit like this. It had more useful functions than I had anticipated. The instruction manual could be better for a user new to Garmin. Once you learn how to use it it's wonderful. The shopping and restaurant menu is somewhat incomplete and/or out of date. An update would be helpful
2,Not great,"I bought and used this plotter over the summer of 2008 in Maine. While better than nothing the screen is really too small to be useful. If you zoom out to get a range of a few miles, you lose chart detail. The screen keys on the cursor, and it can then be difficult to find the arrow indicating the boat position again. I would have returned it, but Amazon has only a 30 day return policy on unused items. So you buy it and try it, you own it. Unless you have a very small craft, buy a plotter with a larger screen."
3,Just ok,Battery has a very poor lifespan. Good marine and land GPS so it works well on my boat as well as in my car. Screen is more than big enough for my 28 foot express cruiser. Sometimes the display dims out.
3,Simply Common Sense,"This is a decent enough book, but I found that it wasn't very helpful to me - a person who has been walking the pagan path for a long time or has experience with children does not really need The Family Wicca Book. Everything in it is simply plain common sense that most people can work out for themselves. The answers to the tough questions weren't really that innovative, just practical thinking - and others might answer some of those questions differently.Having said that, I also think this is a good book for parents who have no prior experience with children, or who have just come to Wicca. If you are in this group, I do recommend that you buy the book - it can give you some solid advice, and perhaps offer a springboard from which you can develop your own ideas."
4,Really shows how kids can be part of Wicca,"I have read many books on pagan and feminist spirituality and this is the first that helps me understand where my kids would fit in to that lifestyle. In addition, there is good advice for parenting in general, especially for older kids who are starting to think for themselves.The author acknowledges solitary practitioners, but does seem to favor working in covens."
4,A Great Start For Family Pagans,I found the book very informative and very interesting. Its great to see ideas on how others are raising their childeren in Wicca tradition...a must have for those that want to welcome their child or childeren into the craft and this is the best way to get started.
5,excellent resource,"This book is terrific for those who want to learn more about integrating the Pagan faith into their child's life, and it covers important topics and questions that will likely come up, such as ""Why do my friends/their parents/people say I am going to hell?"" ""Why don't we worship Jesus?"" ""Why don't we go to church?"" ""How do I know God/dess loves me?"" I love this resource so very much and it can be used for many age groups."
3,Not enough and going the wrong way,"Missing the mark---literally. What makes this remotely interesting is Luongo's drumming. Anyone who ever saw Rat Race Choir during the 70's in NY will find it nostalgic but probably not much more. While John was great with The Who; trying to recreate that same magic with other players just does not work. Steve Lunongo has sold himself a little short with this work. Time would be better spent trying to piece together the Rat Race Choir (RRC) line-up from the 70's. That music is far better than this. The Chemistry of Hitt, Luongo, Chmela, and McGowan was untouchable by others then and the original works of RRC are still relevant today. Bury the hatchet, get back together, and sell millions of CDs. You were the American equivalent of led Zeppelin. It's not too late!"
5,papillons,"si quelqu'un me demande... pourquoi le produit( le livre) de l'auteur(se) a plus d'attraction! Je ne peux repondre, comme on me demande la question... pourquoi le soleil est brillant? Le talent d'un auteur(se) dans ce cas doit etre genial! C'est le cas de Papillons de l'auteuse Clementine! J'aime que vous avez de meme impression pour ce livre!.... Excellent, je peux dire!..."
2,A bit disappointed,The introduction is well written and gives a good overview and history of interracial dating. I wonder why the author chose the people she interviewed; few of them them seemed to have had interracial dating experiences themselves. I was looking for more information about how couples adjust and make successful marriages despite racial differences.
4,Creative Techniques For Stained Glass,Good book mainly for those that are looking for creative projects in 3D.Very good pictures.
2,not for beginners,"Take a hands-on class before you read this book, there is waaay too much basic knowledge one must know in order to do successful stain glassing"
3,Beware,"This is only the 3 inch head, the picture and the wording (calling it a system)leads you to believe that you are recieving more than just the head it self. this is poor advertising fringing on fraud. the head is of good quality, all the knives now are made from powdered metal."
3,To bad most of it is fake.,"I have had this book collection for years. I bought it as Costco about 8 to 10 years ago. It is truly amazing to see everything this man had collected. Unfortunately it is now come to light that most of it is fake. He made it up, stole it, or paid people to lie about it for him. Turns out he was the Barry Madoff of Sports Collectables. He even fooled the MLB Hall of Fame (they ended up returning most of the 7 million dollars worth of bogus stuff they bought) and Billy Crystal paid over $230,000 for a bogus Mantle glove. Sad."
3,no response!,"I love the product, but one of my weight pouches has a whole in it. I love to do leg lifts with the weights on , but cant cause the black shot comes out all over. I have contacted the company twice just asking for 1 replacement pouch, and they have not responded. So, I am not happy."
5,Extraordinary poetry.,"This is one of the best modern poetry books I've read. It is moving and powerful. I read the book straight through and then started again. This book, to me, is what poetry should be - language that effects one at a level deeper than concious understanding."
2,Interesting collection of old articles,"Crypto Anarchy is an interesting read, unfortunately, the vast majority (in fact, almost all of them) of the writings years old or available free on-line.While many of the articles are about the eclectic nature of the net, the reality is that the net has simply turned into another business tool and the utopia that the net was supposed to create never materialized.As an example, Ludlow devotes a number of pages to Barlow's ""Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"". Both the declaration and the retort to it are well over five years old and have been already been written about in myriad times.While many of the articles are dated and obsolete, the single timely and well-written article is by Nathan Newman on the issue of taxes for e-commerce transactions.Overall, Crypto Anarchy is an interesting reading of old articles."
4,Great for Smaller bodies of water.!,"I bought this item in late summer and have used it many times. It is very stable, you can even stand up and fish if you like. The material is pretty tough although I have had to repair one small hole. The kit that comes with it works very well. I would definately recommend purchasing a portable air pump it makes life so much easier. Inflates fully with pump in about 10 minutes."
5,Great inflatable,"This boat is great. It is very durable and very stable. I have not had a chance to put my trolling motor on it yet, but I am certain I will have no problems with it. For the price you can not beat it."
4,Fish Hunter = dope!,"First of all don't bother asking if the boat will fit as many people as it says it will because it won't. Not ever. Secondly this boat rocks! It is super sturdy, I've stood up in it while my husband was casting. It has 2 fishing pole holders which is really handy. Inflates fast enough from what I've noticed. The advantage with an inflatable boat like this is that you can store it in a bag & not worry about having to tow it or store it. This summer will be infinitely more improved now that this little boat has found a way into our lives and our hearts."
4,"Great Boat, But...","We bought this boat to use for lake fishing. In terms of its design and features, everything was great. It had all we wanted at a great price. The only thing I didn't love about this boat was its size. It says its supposed to fit several people, but I didn't find that to be true. My wife and I are short people, but even with just the two of us, we were cramped. When you consider the gear you need to bring for a day of fishing on the lake, there wasn't enough room left for us to comfortably stretch out our legs. Go ahead and get a Sevylor boat, just get the 12' version instead of the 9' version. One more thing. I'd recommend buying a couple of flotation seat cushions to add to the included inflatable seats, otherwise, you'll be sitting very low."
3,"a nice and safe boat,but take time to inflate.","Pros:1. The boat is very safe and stable on water, unlikely to be turned over.2. It saves space.Cons:1. It takes time to be inflated. About 20 mins.2. It is all right for two adults. And I don't think it is safe to sit 6 adults.3. And the reason for only giving 3-star is because the two inflatable seats. One is ok and the other already leaked without any visible damage. So, I am a little bit worried about the quality of the whole boat. Worried if it will leak in the water. So, I always wear the life jacket vest when I boat."
2,4-person boat?,"This was advertised as a 4-person boat so I figured there would be plenty of room for my husband and me to go fishing in it. I've been in bathtubs bigger than this, and I'm not talking about the spa or garden tubs. Just because it can hold the weight of four people doesn't mean that many could fit in it. The only way four people could fit in this boat would be if two were floating on the outside and the other two were under 10 years old. Neither one of us are tall but I was scrunched up and practically eating my knees. It was unstable, too. Although my husband did say it was fine for one person. Total waste of money."
3,A Different Brand of Butterfinger,"This candybar is basically just a different brand of Butterfinger. The taste, though not as good as many other types of candybars I've tried, is good and peanuty. Like the Butterfingers do, Clark bars stick to your teeth. But the Clark bars seem to be a little bit lighter and flakier then Butterfingers, so they're easier to get off of your teeth. At least that's what I think. Overall, if you like chocolate with a crunchy peanut center, I say Clarks are decent. But my personal favorites are Kit Kats, 3 Musketeers, Milky Ways, and Reeses."
4,cute dress but hat is floppy,"The dress is cute, but the hat flops over rather than standing up as in the picture."
1,Rampage Chardony3 Mule,"I didn't like these shoes at all. They are cheap quality and the bottoms are very slippery. I fell down some stairs the 2nd time I wore them. I looked at the bottoms and they collect any kind of grime possible. They don't allow your feet to breathe allowing them to slip off mid step when walking. It's quite embarassing when you're in Target and you're shoes are flying off your feet. I can see why the shoes were so inexpensive. I have many, many pairs of shoes and these so far are the only shoes I've had a bad experience with."
1,What a waste.,"I purchased this product for approximately $17+ for a package of 3. When I received the product 2 of the hot hearts were already completely crystallized, meaning the gel like substance had already hardened. The hot heart should only crystallize when the metal disc is bent which releases the heat. At first I thought that it was due to shipping that the hearts crystallized. However, after boiling them in hot water to reset it back to the gel like state and wait for it to cool to room temperature, I was disappointed to find out that they crystallized again after cooling and therefore they were useless. The one heart that was not damaged only worked after one use and then it was useless like the other two hearts that came in the package. Money I could have used to buy gas for my car."
2,Hot Heart Massager,I realy liked them. My wife realy likes them with the lotion.The only problem I have with them is that they do'nt last very long after about 10 times of boiling them they do not work any more. Other then that they are great.
4,So far so good,"Initial installation was frustrating. After figuring it out, I installed it ""my way"" and it was straightforward. Have only tried it once so far. Must adjust velocity! Seems to work but may need a tweek."
5,This thing works,"It is a little more time to install than a screw barrel, but once you got it it is good. There is an alan bolt at the base of the barrel that stops it from ""just popping out"" you just need to tighten it up. The balls do look like they are flying in slomotion because of the extra spin the barrell puts on them but trust me they are not. How straight they fly and how well they break depends on the paint you run through your marker.(cheep V.S not-so-cheep)or try turning up your marker.No doubt about it it improves accuracy and distance, if you install it correctly (Which is not that hard)and it adds a nice look to your marker."
2,Velocity drops steeply at a range,"I purchased this barrel for my 98 Custom some time ago. After using it for a whole summer and struggling to keep my shots in a tight group I would not reccomend this ""upgrade"". The installation has to be just right for this barrel to even work, and before anyone flames me I used Marbalizer paint and a nitro tank for consistency. My biggest problem however is the lack of speed toward the end of the shots. Sure an extra 50-100 feet of range is nice, but not if your target can literally dodge your paintball. I have been on the recieving end of the flatline at range and it is little more than a joke. I'm midly out of shape but I can still easily dodge the incoming rounds from a flatline at 150-200 feet, or better still stand up and let them bounce off of me. Save yourself $100 and buy a J&J ceramic or the like. The end shot velocity with this barrel is almost useless."
1,Worst paintball upgrade ever!,I sent this item back. Made my short range accuracy horrible. Added distance to my long range shots but with zero accuracy. I hated this barrel on my Tippman 98 Custom. The barrel added so much backspin the balls never hit the same area twice.
2,It's not the best,"Sure the flatline does improve the distance IF you install it correctly. PROBLEMS WILL OCCUR if it is not. Such as accuracy, distance, and velocity. The paintball most likely will curve right or down. This cuts down on the dictance dramatically. Also, the velocity is greatly affected. I was testing the gun by shooting at a tree 6-7 yards away and sometimes the paintballs would just bounce off the tree(if I actually hit the tree due to the curving there was some degree of difficulty at first). I then put the standard barrel on and the paintballs were more accurate and much faster. The speed of a flatline is like watching a slow motion of a standard berrel, so if you do get this gun crank up your velocity and make sure the breel is lined up coreectly,because this is not a screw in barrel. The barrel is just inserted. There is nothing to keep it from coming out or going out of line."
3,not that great,I got this barrel for christmas and it seemed pretty nice except i wasnt that happy when i played with it. the barrel kept on chopping my paintballs which i later found out that it only fits a certain type of balls. the barrel adapter is also not that great and it doesnt completley align the barrel with the gun which keeps the paintball from fitting into the barrel causing it to chop. I would like to say though that tippmann did not lie about the range difference. when i went to try-city i could see that the paintballs were flying out of the field from the other side.
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS BARREL IT IS THE WORST ANYTIME IT HEATS UP IT BREAKS AND IT MESSES UP UR GUN
4,Not bad for the price,"I was a little hesitant to purchase a pair of GPX FRS100 radios because of the low price and no previous experience, however they have lived up to the billing. I was pleasantly surprised at the range they work at. In my testing, I could communicate up to 2 KM (from inside our home to the inside of my office building with a large two-storey structural metal building in between). I read the review about sturdiness. It's housed in a plastic case but one of my kids dropped one on the sidewalk and it's still kicking with no ill effects. There's only two channels, but in my area that's plenty. After all, you can only use one channel at a time anyway and if the kids inadvertently switch channels, there's only one other channel to try to reach them."
3,A nice book,"Very good photographs and reviews inside, but there's a lack of technical drawings to give us a better understanding of the projects."
1,outdated book,"I ordered this copy for old time sake.I joined the Corps in 1984 and had lost my copy.I ordered this copy hoping to replace the lost copy but I really thought this would be the updated copy.I was upset to get the book only find that it is the 1983 edition.So much has happened to the Corp since '83 that is edition is now obsolete.If you want an updated copy wait for someone who has a used copy to sell theirs.it's cheaper and better.Semper Fi,Devil Dogs."
2,Essential Subjects,While many of the chapters contain information that will never change this 20-year-old edition is very outdated for anyone who may be or planning on eing a Marine. There are more recent issues of the guidebook that should be offered as replacements for this antiquated issue.
5,Another home run for Sony,"I have several Sony products. Flat screen TV, VCR and so on. When shopping for a CD burner/dvd rom, as soon as I saw the name Sony I was half way sold. To me, Sony products are, and have allways been, quality. I have never regretted buying a Sony, what ever it is."
3,Orbit 62001 Water Hose Timer,Works as advertised. One suggestion would be to also sell a bypass that wouldlet the same huse outlet be used at normal flow.
3,"Great product, snotty customer service","This thing works well. The only negative is the the male end where you connect the hose is plastic and strips easily. How much would it cost to do that in brass-25?The real problem with these folks is the snotty attitude of customer service. They informed me that the only things covered by warranty were manufacturing defects. That is crazy. Furthermore, they sent me 6 questions for which they wanted answers before they would stand behind their product.They say to use Teflon tape on that plastic male end. That is incredibly unrealistic when you are in the middle of a large property and need to change the particular hose. They should spend the extra quarter and make it durable.Thank goodness Amazon is there to help the consumer for design problems that result in failure after a short time."
3,Tiny text,"It might be OK but the type in the manual is so miniscule I couldnt read it! Such a shame, but these guys should sell bibles on the head of a pin"
3,"After initial anguish, good product","First product did not work, was replaced promptly. Since then has worked well. There is a serious programming glitch. The unit defaults to no days per week. Who in the world would program something to sprinkle no days per week. 99% of people will want to sprinkle every day or every other day. the unit should default to every day. I spent a lot of time tracking this glitch. Also, the outlet threads do not go far enough to the end. I had to grind the end to get some hose fittings on. Excellent warranty. Excellent support"
2,orbit 6200 lawn timer,"its works good for a while but start leaking and if you make a mistake the time wont undo the signal for five minutes making you wait even when you take out the battries it keeps on going and start saying low battery . typical chinese junk, but think it the better one of all the others . so its the best pience of junk of the others. the water seal rotted in two years."
5,Orbit 62001 Digital Watering Timer,This product does exactly what it is intended for. It is well made with heavy body construction and so far is waterproof. Programming was relatively straight forward although somewhat daunting at first. Just follow the very explicit instructins and the unit will respond.
1,Stays on,"I bought two of these. One failed after a few months by staying on at the end of the cycle, flooding my yard. Seemed to work on manual some of the time. New batteries made no difference. I dismantled it and there was no damage or debris. The solenoid mechanism is extremely delicate, depending on a fine spring and the magnetic properties of a small plunger. I finally got it working but it failed again after a few months. Bad design.I would prefer that it fail by not going on. If the lawn starts looking dry, I can address that. If it floods for 12 hours before I see it, it will do damage, cost a lot of money (water is expensive where I live), and will break the law (watering is only allowed on certain days and times).UPDATE: The second one just failed. I found my back yard flooded this morning."
4,value for money ; minor snag installing,"* The price is relatively low compared to its competion.** It came in in a blister pack with a tiny booklet manual; straight forward installation*** programming the timer is a piece of cake**** fits European metric hose and tap attachment, which was a pleasant surprise for a U.S. product- water continued to leak at the tap attachment, even after moderately strong tightening of the brass knurling nutThe problem could be resolved by adding a rubber washer between the washer with in line mesh filter, provided with the setThe extra washer added has to have the correct dimensions and was unfortunately not provided with the productThe flip up lid to protect the display from the elements does not appear to be waterproof, so let's hope the LCD display has been well sealed in, or ...."
5,Orbit 62001,"I have had the product for about a month now and so far it works great. No issues at all. We will see how it withstands a summer in Texas and then a full year of use to get a true reliability track record. Seems to be constructed of high quality parts and the programming is easy to understand. So far, no problems like other products I have read about."
1,Irratic,"I have one of these timers and have recommended it to my neighbors, who have purchased another 5. Only one person has had trouble free use. The timer has a mind of it's own and after a short period, starts to water on it's own agenda or does not shut down as programed. Several people have returned them for replacements, but only got more of the same. I now have an erratic one that is over 90 days old,... out of warantee ... but defective and should be replaced nevertheless. November 9th and my only working timer developed it's own agenda. The fault it in the solenoid / water supply which seems to open or stay open erratically. I hear this product is being discontinued ... good news ... now how about all the unfortunates who bought them??"
3,Failed after 6 weeks,"Failed after only 6 weeks in the worst possible way. Turned on automatically as programmed, but then did not turn off. The digital readout indicates that it is still cycling on and off, but the water is now stuck on all of the time.Update: Contacted Orbit on line and described the failure symptoms. Got an email the following morning and a new valve arrived in the mail a few days later. The replacement valve is working OK."
2,Disappointed,We returned the first unit because of an electronic malfunction when rain was getting into timer. (You would think it would be water proof - it is supposed to be used outside and with a hose). Second unit (replacement for the first) seems to have a valve that does not work. Tried calling Orbit many times about the second unit only to be on hold for 10 to 20 minutes on different occasions. Sent e-mail waiting for response. NOT HAPPY.
4,It Works!,"Having been dissapointed with less expensive timers, I finally bit the bullet and bought the 62001. I could have saved a lot of money if I had done this to begin with. It works reliably, and is very easy to program. Couldn't be happier."
3,Too complcated but reasonable quality,"Good news is it has held up for a couple of years, bad news is I had a hell of time programming it, and it was very expensive. It's not an easy unit to set up, but it does work if you figure it out. I won't buy another (there are others on the market that work as well that are cheaper and easier--more like a digital watch--to program)."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,I wanted a timer that did 2 separate functions this didn't seem to do that.
2,Look good on paper,"the Orbit 62001 look good on paper. The one I got stopped working after 5 days. The The timer portion is easy to use. My problem is with the water on and off valve. That part stopped working in record time. I called the Orbit, they said they would send me a replacement for the valve portion. That was 5 days ago and nothing has come."
5,works well,"It worked well for my vegetable garden when we were away for vacation, and we used it for the whole growing season afterwards!!!!! no problem at all!!!!!"
3,May have been missing something,"Unlike another product that I tried, this one actually worked. It is easy to program and the timer setting is really nice. It has many different settings with a digital readout; very nice. However, the water pressure wasn't adequate to water my lawn. I noticed in the instructions it said to use a washer, but that wasn't included in the box. Also, this is pretty heavy and bulky for my normal water spout on the side of my house. The timer mechanism does swivel, however which is helpful in positioning the hose.All in all, it did work, but the water pressure was so low that i couldn't use it to water my lawn."
2,great for about 6 weeks..then dead,As the tittle suggests this product worked great for about 6 weeks but then the screen just faded out to nothing pretty much over night. I'm going to see about warranty replacement but we'll see how that goes.
5,Owned for over 7 years,"This is a great water timer, with multiple on/off cycles for perfect watering to your schedule. We have had this for well over 7 years & it is still running strong! I came back for another for a different lawn & did so because it is a reliable choice. You can program it to come on everyother, every 3rd or a personal selection pattern (such as every day, or only on Tues/Fri/Sun, your choice of days.) The times you choose can be customized as well, so you can have it come on and off several times to maximize the drenching effect, creating a deeper watering & greener lawn. Ours is the best purchase we ever made for a convenience item & I recommend it highly!"
2,One Year & Died,"Worked great first year.The next year it started screwing up while we were on vacation.Too late to save tomatoes in an unusually dry year.Battery tested good, changed battery any way.Was not reliable after that.Orbit seems to be a major player in these products.My advise is to buy locally and keep your guaranty handy.Set it and monitor it at the start of each season before relying on it."
5,Saves Time and Money,"If you water your grass and are looking to save TIME and MONEY, purchase this now.This is a solid product. It will save you time, because you won't have to worry if you turned the water off.And that is the same reason that it will save you money because you won't over water or forget to turn off the sprinkler.I received a defective one that would turn on 15 seconds after it finished a cycle. I returned it and received another one the next day. (Amazon shipping is awesome)When I received my second one, I set it up and it worked perfectly.When you set up your timer, monitor it the first day or so just to make sure it is turning on and off for the time you programmed.~ Tip ~ The best time to water your grass is around 4 or 5 in the morning before the sun comes up.The only thing I wish it had was a rain feature that would delay the start if it rained."
2,Same Problem as others,"Unit worked for a bit over 30 days, then water won't turn off...gonna ask for a replacement...if I get one that works, it will be a great timer."
3,Did not last,"Mine lasted for two seasons ,it worked well while it worked,,,,,I have used 4or 5 different timers and none of them last more than 2 seasons,,,My next purchase is the Orbit 91213....looks nice,,we will see."
4,a good value,"I had one of these for about eight summers until it gave out. I never even noticed or remembered the brand and disposed of the unit. I searched the web and the box stores to find a suitable replacement and came up disappointed and/or empty. Finally saw and recognized this one on Amazon and am as happy with it as I was with the original. The only drawback is that it is a little complicated to program but it works really well and, that's what counts."
1,Is it me or is it the timer?,"I've used timers like this for almost every garden I've ever had. I read the great reviews and opted for this over the DIG timers I was replacing (all three of them from my old place didn't work when I set up my irrigation in my new house!).I set it up and this morning was it's first run and it failed miserably. I set it to start at 4:30 am and water for an hour. I could still hear the water going when I was getting ready for work at 7. It started but never stopped.Any suggestions? I followed the directions for how to set it. Obviously if it doesn't close the valve then it's worthless. Any suggestions?Thanks,Joan"
2,Fifty-fifty chance it will work!,"After purchasing 4 of these units and having to return 2 because THEY WOULD NOT SHUT OFF THE WATER, I'd say there's a fifty-fifty chance they'll work properly. When they DO work, I've found these timers to be user friendly: easy to program with an override function that makes watering in between programmed waterings easy.I make a point of being sure the water is actually shut off after each programmed watering; having to do this is what I was hoping to avoid by purchasing the timer, but it sure beats flooding the gardens with water, especially in our water starved high desert. If these timers could be made to work reliably, they'd be a good buy."
5,Easy to set up. used for over two years so far,"We have had this connected to the outside faucet for two years now, and it is still going strong. We do live in a climate with no freezing temperatures. I cut a rectangular slot in the side of a styrofoam ice chest I got at the 99 cent store, and keep that over the whole faucet/ timer setup. That keeps it out of the elements."
5,A Wonderful Piece of Lawn Equipment,"This digital watering timer has been totally reliable, is very well-made, and does exactly what it purports to do. Just make sure that when you are installing it you do a test run in ""manual"" as the instructions suggest, or otherwise you might find that you just have a huge reservoir of water underneath your spigot because your hose was not fastened tightly enough to the timer. Otherwise, I totally trust this unit, so much so that I left it ""on duty"" while I was on vacation for over a week. As I expected, when I returned, it had regularly watered my lawn for the exact amount of time I had programmed it for, and nothing more, or less."
3,Leaks too much to keep the water on,"After reading a number of glowing reviews about this timer, I bought it hoping to be able to use it for early morning lawn watering before my husband and I are out of bed. Unfortunately, I can't stop it from leaking where the timer connects to the outlet. I tried plumbers tape and using a wrench to tighten it as much as possible but I can't get the water to stop dripping. Because of this, we can't leave the water on and simply set the timer and walk away. Instead, I used it in the evening to water the lawn for a specific amount of time and then go out and turn the water off after the timer shuts off to stop the drip. Otherwise, our water bill will go through the roof!The timer works very well and can be set a lot of different ways. I like the fact that you can take the timer panel off and set it in the house and then reconnect it. Plus we've had some rain storms and intense heat and the timer has held up well.If this didn't leak, I would give it 5 stars for sure."
4,Difficulties With Motion Sensor Deer Sprinkler,"I purchased this Orbit timer to use to supply water to a Motion Sensor Operated Sprinkler. The hope was to allow the sprinkler to operate in the evenings and keep the deer population out of my garden. During the day I would have the timer turn off the water supply.The plan did not work because the timer requires water to FLOW through the valve when operating in the shut direction. (While the deer problem is significant, it is unlikely the sprinkler would be operating at the time the timer period ends.)Only reason for posting this is to alert a potential buyer that also is addressing a deer problem. It appears well built and the problem I have is entirely my own fault."
3,Great on paper BUT...,"This unit is easy to program and was the closest hose timer that resembled controllers on irrigation systems. You can set days to water, set the start times and duration of 4 individual watering times a day, manually override, delay 24hrs for days it rains... perfect. However, this unit will not be adequate if you have long runs where every little bit of water pressure counts. When open to water, it is restrictive and you will lose some water pressure. A shame really."
4,Nice timer but the batteries are expensive,"I ordered this and then found out that my local Home Depot sold it for $6 less. Oh well, no shipping and no taxes saved me somewhat.The timer is very nice but the unit required two each of the 9 volt clip on batteries for use and they get expensive nowadays.You may wish to look for one that does not require $10 worth of batteries."
5,The best water timer,As a devoted Arizona gardener I have an especial need to keep all of my plants correctly watered. I have found that the Orbit Digitak Watering Timer to be the best and most dependable timer for meeting all of my watering needs. I recommend it most highly.
4,Now I have two of these!,Had these times for about 3 months now and they seems to be pretty reliable. Easy to program and the removable display/keypad simplifies things. When comparing to other timers out there these seem to be the best bang for the $.
1,works great... for one year,"We bought one of these timers early last summer, thinking it was our solution for watering the flower beds automatically. It worked so good (and was easy to use), so we bought another later last year.This year, both timers have stopped working. The timer unit seems fine, but they don't cut off the water. One of them failed within the 1-year warranty, so Orbit replaced the valve assembly. However, now the other unit has failed.Maybe ours were flukes, but I won't be buying these again. Too expensive for only a year's use."
5,water timer,i set up a misting system in my greenhouse and used this timer. It works fantastic. I can program it for 7 days; to come on several times a day; and also program how long it should stay on. I'm thinking about buying another to set up as a timer to water my plants on a drip system. Would highly recommend this.
1,Absolute piece of junk,"Don't get this for your kid(s). It is virtually worthless. Made from thin plastic with painted chrome surfaces and cheap plastic lenses. One of the lenses inside the microscope is dirty and every thing my child looks at under it is overlayed with a yellow film that is grossly spotted. I will have to unscrew the main compartment of the microscope to clean the only lens left that I haven't cleaned in hopes of making this microscope of any possible use. Think a higher zoom power version will be any better...don't count on it! I agree with another reviewer, this microscope should not even be sold; a complete waste of money."
5,Gift...,"but looks like a winner...sturdy case and lots of parts, my 11 yr old cant wait! Hes located it 3 times and I had to move it out till Christmas!"
5,Best Cookbook Ever!!!!!!!,"Better Homes&Gardens; MEAT COOK BOOK Over 400 meat recipes How to buy,store,prepare and serve.This is the best cookbook ever!!! I grew up learning to cook with this Meat Cookbook. These are time tested recipes with old fashion goodness and wholesomeness you don't see anymore.My all time favorites: ""Old-Time Beef Stew"" & ""Steak and Potato Supper"".I purchased two copies for my daughter and my niece. I still own the one my dad bought me like 30 years ago. The recipes are easy to understand. It doesn't you're an experienced cook or a beginner, if you like home cooked family dinners, this cookbook is a must have."
4,In defense of subs everywhere,"I know this is supposed to be a review but if any of the other reviewers read this, this is for you:Your subwoofer was only doing what it was built to do when it gave out these booming, often muddy, low tones. There is nothing wrong with your sub, what you need is an equalizer if you don't like that sound quality. You need good speakers for the higher frequency to give you the nice clear tones to complete a good overall sound, and tone down the levels on the subwoofer to eliminate that muddy sound, but keeping the bass nice and solid.My suggestion then would be an audio reciever with an equalizer."
3,Get your money's worth,"When you buy this little radio, you will definitely get your money's worth. Although it does not have the best reception, it is nonetheless a decent product. It is ideal for trips to the park, golf course, or your backyard. It's very small so you can tuck it away without being bogged down. If you are a shopping for high quality, then you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you need some dependable protable tunes it's not a bad little radio."
3,denon dcm-290,"I'm being critical here- this is a good-sounding player. My critique would be that the sound isn't balanced- it's weighted toward the highs. Not much lows or low mids. Bright-sounding (I'm sensitive to this) but not harsh.Nice amount of detail- I can understand lyrics on some songs that I never could before (our previous changer was a JVC). Changer is less ""clunky"" sounding than our JVC."
4,Denon 290 CD Player,"This player makes my old Sony look like a clumsy tank. I enjoy it except for one problem. Scratched cds won't play. But they play fine on the boom box in the kitchen! I thought that a garage sale boom box wouldn't be able to read cds better than the Denon, but I was wrong."
1,denon dcm - 290,"As a long time purchaser of Denon products I would not buy another Denon product. I purchased a Denon DCM - 290 Cd changer. It stopped working after 13 months. I contacted Denon, they said I could send it to one of their authorized repair places, but it would not be repaired free of charge since it was over the one year warranty period. I just received a call from the repair shop. They told me that the disk table and much of the inside had to be replaced and would cost $258 which is more than the $249 I paid for it new. Unfortunately Denon no longer makes reliable products."
5,Denon DCM-290,The DCM-290 is a solid 5-disk CD changer for a home entertainment center. I have yet to run into problems and I have owned the product for seven months. The rotator tray seems a little flimsy but CDs fits snuggly and has never got caught off track. Remote programming quickly corresponds with the unit control panel for easy and dependable use.
1,Not the usual Denon quaility,"I bought this unit in September of '08. I immediatly noticed that it had some issues, but it played well enough not to be much of a bother. It had a real problem playing mp3s / burned cds which later developed into it not playing at all. As a past lover of all things Denon, this changer changed my mind. Though many of the older models (I have 2 others) are true workhorses and have the greatest sound and functionality, this unit is entirely lacking. As of today, I am looking for a replacement (this unit is out of warranty), but I doubt it will be from this manufacturer."
2,They are right -- this thing is unreliable,"Bought this thing locally, given the bad reviews, figuring that having my local dealer to stand behind it might help. Well, during the first year of operation, it ALMOST worked all the time. I judged that it wasn't worth my time to have the dealer send it back to chase an intermittent problem that DENON would almost certainly deny existed.I'm now in the second year, and it is getting more unreliable. It just flat refuses find disks and/or tracks unless it is in the right mood. I don't use it much, which is why I haven't done anything about it. I just hate the fact that DENON sells such a flawed product now; why won't they make a reliable unit?"
5,Denon DCM-290,"I Have brought denon products before and they have always worked great, this product is of the same high standard as allways."
1,STAY AWAY!! HUGE FAILURE!,I have had great luck with Denon of the years. We have 3 of these installed as background music players at the convention center I work at. They were rarely used but last time I went to play some music ALL 3 FAILED TO OPERATE! I tried multiple discs both burned and factory fresh albums and none of them read any discs. We have an older Denon that plays everything we tried to play on the DCM-290 players but have since moved to streaming music. What a shame that a great company would put out this garbage. I have never seen a failure rate like this.
3,Factory refurbished,"Thought was buying new as ad stated, when arrived the box stated factory refurbished. It does work and have had no problems. Was under the impression it would be new as the ad said."
2,"Good documentory of sasquatch, exellent for the researcher","Exellent documentory for the sasquatch researcher.Shows A dead sasquatch found in the Texas, Arkansas borders,DNA tests are done on it and it`s not human."
2,A little helpful,"This book was only a little help. It doesn't clearly explain the material. If you are learning only from the book, you will most likely be lost. It was an alright suppliment to the lecture and helped a little on homework, but I would not recommend the book if it is not required."
3,"Good book, but you should already know the basics","This is the required book for my graduate class on structures. Its best if you already have a familiarity with the basic concepts of stress and strain, torsion, bending, etc. It has good examples, though, and the problems at the end of the chapter are not too hard (tho, they do required a lot of algebra and plug-and-chug). There are not selected answers in the back.If you're looking for a good basic book on structures, this one probably isn't for you.Also, they don't actually talk a whole lot about applications to aircraft structures. What the book DOES do is cover the basic theories that one would need to start to analyze aircraft structures. It does not cover design of aircraft structures."
1,Short and Not Descriptive,"I am an Aerospace Engineering student and had this book for a flight mechanics class. Honestly, for the money, this book is a total waste. First off it is relatively very short (...). If you're going to spend that much money on a book this size, make sure its pages are pure gold or the book unlocks the meaning of life. Second off it simply states and quickly derives complicated structural theories without much introduction or explanation, and provides no application of the theories to actual aircraft. In fact there isn't even a drawing of an aircraft anywhere in the book. Honestly a giant disappointment, and just like my college to make us waste our money on this unintelligible leaflet. Surf around for ten minutes on Amazon and you will find at least ten books on the same subject that are larger, more in depth, more explanatory, provide real life applications of the course material, and have appendices with material and atmospheric properties for the same price."
1,Is it possible to give 0 stars?,"Wow..... It's shocking that a book this poor could actually reach publication.This book appears to consist of a collection of the author's teaching notes. Highly mathematical (fine), but utterly lacking in the ""what this formula means in the real world"" department. Aren't we as students trying to understand where all the math is leading us?Most annoying of all, throughout the book the author uses the following: ""It is easy to prove that..."" Well, I'm sure it is easy for him to prove it. He's the f'ing teacher. But for us, the students, it's NOT trivial, nor should it be treated as such.I concur with the other review. Stay as far away from this text as possible."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"I HAD TO BUY THIS BOOK FOR MY STRUCTURE CLASS IN AEROSPACE ENGINEERING; PAYING SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE REALLY AGGRAVATED ME. THIS BOOK HAS NO CONTENT, THERE IS NO APPLICATION TO REAL LIFE PROBLEMS, IT IS PURE GARBAGE. THE TEACHER FOLLOWED EXACTLY THIS TEXTBOOK FOR HIS CLASS; I DON'T KNOW MORE ABOUT AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES THAN I DID BEFORE TAKING THAT CLASS. 1 STAR IS WAY TOO MUCH!!! STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!!!!!!"
2,"The Good and the Bad, mostly the Bad.","I was required to purchase this book for my Junior level A&AE; Structural Analysis Course. Chock full of theory and derivations, it doesn't set forth a clear path for learning, but rather a thicket in which problems sets are solved by wildly searching backward in the book for equations and examples in order to help make some sense of the problem at hand. While the book is full of good problems, the concepts tested in the problems are not always clearly explained (What the heck is shear flow anyway?).This book is recommended as a junior or senior level structures text, but how well it is received depends highly upon the Professor's lecture style (Straight from the text?(=bad) or supplemental to the text?(=not as bad)).The Bad outweigh the Good."
1,Worst Book Ever!!,"I am an aerospace engineering student that has to use this book for my structures class. This is by far the worst book I have ever used in my entire college career. The author derives several complicated formulas without hardly any explanation, and makes it difficult to understand the concepts. There are very very few examples to look at to understand the concepts. Worst book ever, do not buy this book!!!"
1,one of the worst book,"Bad book. I was forced to buy the book by the course. The example are bad, the explanation are unclear, and the structure of the book was bad."
1,Too Little Information,This book cannot explain any topic to a student. Not enough worked out examples. THE WORST BOOK IN MY AEROSPACE UNDERGRADUATE CAREER!
1,My thoughts on this album,"I was surfing through this site and I bought this CD along with the second album of this same singer based on the positive reviews I read here about her debut recording. I was hoping that the positive reviews I read were truthful and helpful. As much as I would have liked to enjoy this singer, I was disappointed. This singer has a very limited range. The tracks in this recording sound similar and they are not at all interesting. She does wordless songs that I could not bear to listen to and that I had to skip. I absolutely adore Lennon and McCartney's music, but the first track, And I Love Him, was not interesting. The song did not arc and nothing new or fresh was added in the arrangement."
3,"Stainless steel?...if so, not good.","This gauge was purchased believing that KD was a good brand name and the product would reflect decent quality. The product description shows the gauge to be 1.4 lbs and the shipping weight to be 4.2 oz. That's a good trick.The gauge arrived, packaged well and on time. However, there were two leaves, the .085 and .090 that were stuck together with a spot of rust?Although not a large spot and I was able to smooth it out with steel wool, stainless steel should not be corroding in any manner, especially, with what appears to be rust! I'll be getting my micrometer out tomorrow to check the accuracy of the leaves....if anything but correct, I will post an update"
5,great mat for the money!,"This is the best treadmill mat i have ever been able to purchase! I have had everything from rugs to pieces of flooring that you snap together! This is by far the best mat for any piece of equipment to be set upon! The noise was reduced by a ton, and the look is simple! Perfect!"
2,Somehow...this book 'misses',"The author is an EXCELLENT writer. There is no question about that! I think what is missing here is the flow. It's not a book where you finish each chapter and you have to 'keep reading'. You can set it on a table...and quite possibly wait a year to pick it up again. The story is relatively simple--with a few eyebrow raisers here & there. The writers' writing is the only thing that captures the reader (me). I'd highly recommend this author read the book, THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham or MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA or THE NOTORIOUS DR. AUGUST...then, you'll read a story that 'flows'."
3,The novel begins in lush prose & promise but then dissolves,"Rich and startling prose and a sense of multi-level meaning to be developed start the book off to a rivetting start. But, like the hero, the book gets mired in its pedophilic obsession, endlessly repeating lush catalogues of the eroticism evoked by teenage boys. Meaning is pursued (timeless of boyhood, art collection vs. art appreciation, the special love between mother and son, time pushing relentlessly forward). But meaning steadily loses ground until the book, like the hero, ends exhausted by his obsession and its blind and dead-ended pursuit."
2,The Whole is Less Than the Sum of Its Parts,"Stadler, who mesmerized us with ""The Sex Offender"" takes us down the pedophiliac lane again. This time he uses exquisite words and intense sentences, but the ""voice"" of the narrator is thin. Also, there seems to be a point to be made: Pederasts are people too. OK, that's fine, but it sure gets creepy after awhile. And, frankly, I never gave a damn about any of the characters. Who cares? If you want beautiful writing and a great story, try The Hours by Cunningham or An Arrow's Flight by Merlis. If you insist on reading this one, I'll trade you for something."
3,It made me sad.,"Stadler's once again making contact with young boys and I can't blame him. He's a charming and wise writer. He knows how to recreate the theme, bringing more realistic and sharp perspectives to it. This is a haunting book but sometimes it seems very melancholy and colorless. ""The Sex Offender"" is far much imaginative and rich. ""Amazon"" sent it to me with a very pretty golden cover, rather then the blue one they're displaying here."
1,Disappointingly unfunny,"The obsession with the boy required the balance of levity, but the humor was so forced and cliche that I cringed when the author needed me to laugh and take a breather from the claustrophobic theme of sex with underage boys. The blurbs make much of the language, setting and sentences, and I found the writing throughout to be completely un-remarkable. A big disappointment."
3,Not one the best in Sylvia Sym's discography.,"I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this album was initially put out on the basis of some promoter's misguided concept of showing to the world that Sylvia Syms was hip and ""with it."" Unfortunately the arranger selected to write the charts for the backups did not have the gifts and ability to showcase Miss Sym's talents in proper fashion. The result is this production which is more annoying than gratifying -- a sad betrayal of a very special singer."
3,PSP Carry Pouch,"The pouch is a really good protective device for the PSP much better than a bulky plastic case, no doubt at all, that was the only reason to buy this item because the strap feels really cheap, it only comes in white, and mostly all the PSP on the markett are Piano Black. So if you lose your original PSP carry pouch then this is a good replacement to protect your device.PSP Pouch and Wrist Strap"
2,Not worth price,"I bought this pouch from a thirf party seller on Amazon who charged me only $5 including shipping. I thought that I might have got a good deal for my $5. Was I suprised when I got this.This is only a glove, something that should only cost $2. I am suprised that Amazon is selling this for $20. It is a decent product, it covers the PSP well, but it doesn't enclose it with a zipper or anything sadly."
4,Bueno,"Es de buen material, protege bastante el PSP, es recomendable sin lugar a dudas. Sobre el envio, todo rapido y eficaz."
4,GOOD PROTECTOR,"THIS PROTECTOR IS PRETTY GOOD AND KEEPS SCRATCHES OF THE SYSTEM WHATS MORE TO SAY.. THE BAD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I ORDERED A BLACK AND I GOT A WHITE, THERE'S NO PLACE THAT MAKES YOU CHOOSE YOUR COLOR WHICH SUCKS AS THE WHITE GETS DIRTY FAST FAST FAST I'M TLKING ABOUT NOTICING A DIFFERENCE THE FIRST WEEK, BECAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU REST IT WELL THERE'S SOME SORT OF DUST OR DIRT, SO PLZ WORD OF ADVICE BUY A BLACK CASE WHICH WOULD NOT SHOW ALL THIS..."
3,Hard case would be better,This case is okay but the open end is concerning. I am always worried the PSP will slip out of the case. The material is soft. I think a hard case would be a better choice to protect it from being dropped.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This PSP accessory is horrible! It doesn't even secure your PSP, and you don't want to risk the chance of your PSP falling out and getting broken, do you? There is one good thing though, about the case, is that you will not have to worry about your screen getting scratched, because it is very soft. Take my review into consideration."
3,Worth the cost,Sleeve is ok - not sure where you attach the wrist string (directly to PSP) - still cheap probably worth it
3,It works!,The carrying case is cheap and flimsy and the strap in not adjustable. But it work to protect the screen and to prevent drops.
2,This was not a game but a pouch for the game,The quality of the pouch is kind of bad. But it does protect your PSP until you can find a better one and invest on a better pouch
2,Not what I wanted,I actually sent this back to Amazon ... its just not what I wanted. I already have a really good case and you can get different color wrist straps right here on Amazon for cheap :^)
5,Fantastic!,"This show is amazing. Season three picks up the night of prom, and we see who is left standing and who isn't. We then watch as the characters come to terms with new realities, new loves, new opportunities and new struggles. Season three kicks up the drama really fast, which its young audience will love- while maintaining the ""realness"" of the past seasons."
1,poor buy,"junk, not that easy to use. cheaply built, slips when cutting, hard to load disks. ive used much better products."
4,Take a Look,"What in this movie is anticipated? The coal-black complexion of Natalie Cole? The fact that she is the staring actress? (I kept waiting for her to break out in song.) Is it the bond the white child forms with his parents' servant? How quickly the mother of the child turns on this servant who is 'just like a member of the family?' Where Lily goes when trouble is suspected? How the boy reacts when he finds out? Her true relationship with family members? The eventual outcome of compounding transgressions?Not much of what you see is expected. The fact that Natalie portrays an uneducated Southerner neutralizes anticipation for a dramatic performance with enough surprises to make the whole lesson in family ties worthwhile viewing.(Natalie Cole has an unrelated album called ""Take a Look."" Interestingly, every song title has something to do with this movie.)"
1,Plain Dumb,I have seen better AI in Nintendo 64 Games and the graphics make it hard to see whats going on. I wish the AFL would make a next-gen game that really rocks.
5,Captures Kim Wilson Live,"""Lookin' for Trouble"" represents the spirit and energy of a live Kim Wilson show. While Wilson may not have the level of vocal ""chops"" that he displays in his harp playing, he more than holds his own as a singer and interpreter of the blues. Having just seen a Wilson show at a local Boston area club, I enthusiastically recommend not only his excellent discs, of which ""Lookin' for Trouble"" is one, but also encourage listeners to see him live. He and his band have such commitment, technique, and passion that one is swept up in the joy of a uniquely American art form."
2,What Happened?,"This album was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever listened to. I was so eager to hear this album after his last studio effort (My Blues) and the awesome show I caught in Maryland. The songs lacked everything, lyrically, technically, and instumentally, that ""My Blues"" offered. If somebody is just getting into blues harp, ""My Blues"" is all you need. This album would be best left on the rack at the store. I had a friend insist I take five bucks for ""Lookin For Trouble.""It should also be noted that ""Lookin For Trouble"" lost the commitment to keeping the heritage of blues alive. Read the liner to ""My Blues"" and see what Kim writes about his Blue Collar music label. You will see that ""Lookin For Trouble"" does not fit any of these ideals."
3,Not Quite Up To Standard!,"Kim Wilson is among the finest harp players of all times and his playing on this disc is exceptional. However, that playing is sometimes overshadowed by Wilson's rather limited abilities as a vocalist. Wilson's limited vocal range is a definite draw back to this CD and one that narrows considerably the creative envelope in which his band plays. Much of the disc seems retro, flat and repetitive. If you have to have this, buy it used and then look for other Wilson releases like ""This Joint Is Smokin'""."
2,Read The Book Instead,"The book is an incredible story of the atrocities and hardships that Victor Herman overcame in the gulags of Siberia...and if you can find a copy, it is highly recommended.The movie is not faithful to the book. I would say maybe 50% of the scenes follow the book, but are so ""watered down"" (it is rated PG, but Herman's experience was much more horrible than could be captured in a PG movie) as to give a wrong impression and even to trivialize what Herman accomplished in just surviving the gulags. The other 50% of the scenes are just additions by the script writer and not in the book...The acting is, however, good.It will be up to somebody like Spielberg to capture the book for the big screen...it would then hopefully be like ""Schindler's List"", but instead for the millions that Stalin exterminated in the Siberian gulags..."
3,Coming Out of the Ice,"This is a harrowing film about the Gulag Archipelago, a portrait of an unusual survivor, and a reminder of the cruelty of the Soviet system of totalitarianism in which an American happened to be trapped."
4,Worth the money,"This book is worth the money, It is lacking a bit in the high performance section but overall a good purchase."
4,TH 350 Transmission,I found this book to be informative and well written. I do believe it will be a great asset to my project
4,"Great series, subpar packaging","The Gantz Perfect Score arrived on time, but in a condition that could not possibly be described as ""new"" as the box the dvds come in had clearly been opened already, and the bottom half of the ball was scratched. I contacted the seller and received a prompt response, saying I would be sent a replacement. The replacement was in only slightly better condition; however, I love this series and it's at a great price so I decided to keep it. Really the only reason I gave a 4/5 was for the condition it came in; this is a 5/5 series!"
3,A Very Mixed Bag,"This series is a very mixed bag. If you can handle the over the top vulgarity, obscenity, and gore there is actually a good story lying beneath it all. The story is both the best and worst part. See, it's a great story, but the anime ruins it. The last disc is comprised entirely (save for the first episode on it) of non-manga made up story. It gives a very sloppy and absolutely ridiculous ending, and never ties a single thing up. This is a pretty series, it looks great, and is fun to watch, but it will leave you running for the manga.The case itself is fairly nice. The top of the ball pops off to have this little fold out holder for the discs. No complaints here.In closing, this is a fun anime if you don't mind some very vulgar moments. If you like the story I recommend the manga so you can see what actually happens.I give it:Visuals: 5Sound: 4 1/2Story: 3 (needs the manga!)"
2,very cheap quality,"I only bought this version of the anime gantz because i liked the look of the ball. i knew exactly what i was buying from the other feedback that had been left. first off the orb is dended alot i realy dont care that it is dented, the only real problem i had with this box set is the wicked cheap paper dvd case and the felt dvd spindle it is horrible the dvds fall out every time i put them back in. This is byfar the worst dvd boxset i have bought to date. The only upside is that the disks came in good condition. my recomendation is to get the thin packs."
4,New?,Well it said new but I have to question that. I just opened it up and the seal was already broken on the box and the mettalic dvd case was all scratched up on the bottom so I have to question the new part but... still looks awesome sitting on my shelf and I am glad it is now finally part of my collection.
3,"Price, price, price","Anything said about this printer has to begin with the fact that, after rebate, it costs ($) (plus shipping, to be picky). With that in mind, you pretty much can't go wrong. One reviewer grumbled that set up was difficult; that wasn't my experience at all. The diagrams were slightly confusing, but most diagrams are. I'd say set-up took me a grand total of 30 minutes, max. (...) If you need a fast, high-volume, ultra-high-res printer, this isn't for you, but if you think you're going to get that kind of printer for this kind of money anywhere, you're living in a fool's paradise. I'm satisfied that, for the (very small amount of) money I spent, I got all the printer I need."
1,short lived,"I found the printer satisfactory. I paid [money] for it, with a rebate. So the price was great. I bought it in September 2001. In February 2002 it began to print everything at an angle. Now I can't get the paper to move through at all. The 90 day warranty has expired. I had little more than 5 months of use."
4,Hewlett Packard DeskJet 648c Printer,a very good printer. very reliable. very good quality color printing.
3,Average but cheap,"For the money, don't expect much. The black ink printing is actually very good, and the printer prints very fast. It's the color where it runs into trouble. It prints deathly slow and the picture quality isn't so good. If you're looking for a standard, good blank ink printer with optional color, then I reccomend this. If you're looking for a good color printer move up and buy a more expensive printer. My last Epson color printer was excellent, and unfortunately, I moved from that to this. Don't get me wrong, its fine, but don't expect to be wowed by it."
1,Setup With USB Impossible,"I purchased two Deskjet 648C's from Office Depot. In neither case could I make the USB work. It would work, however, with the regular parallel cables. I was never able to find the correct driver. After eight hours of effort, I gave up."
2,"The horror, the horror.","This was a terrible buy. Don't purchase this printer, look for a better deal."
3,underwhelming album,"This is an okay album but not one I'd suggest you run out to buy. His choice of material includes some of the most oversung songs (if I hear one more person sing the 7+ minute song ""Soliloquy"" on an album...)but he does choose some less known songs. Having Matt Bogart on the album is a definite plus and you might consider purchasing his albums (""Simple Songs"" and ""More Simple Songs"") before purchasing this one."
2,I just want to install some tile!!!,"Reading this book reminds me of asking what time it is and having someone explain to you the history of the watch and how it was made!!! The world of knowledge which Mr. Byrne apparently has amassed about TILE simply does not either impress or interest me. Maybe he should have picked a more descriptive title such as ""Everything You Could Ever Possibly Want to Know About Tile"" instead of ""Setting Tile."" I just cant imagine why anyone would want to read all of this detail about tile. (A tile aficianado???) A vast majority of this book is simply unnecessary, and therfore confusing, for a weekend warrior homeowner who ""Just wants to install some tile."""
5,Outstanding How To Book,"Well written easy to follow. Tells not only what you can do, but when it would be best to consult a professional. Even when a professional is recommended, he gives clear instructions for anyone who insists on doing every aspect of the job unassisted. Also includes a good reference guide. Shari Luster Fairbanks,Ak"
4,A great guide to Yellowstone's falls,"As a photographer that loves to photograph waterfalls, I bought this book to show me where I could find more waterfalls to photograph. With over 300 waterfalls listed, this is a must have for any waterfall lover. Even though most of the listed waterfalls are in the backcountry of Yellowstone, it is a great resource to plan trips to see these magnificent wonders. The book lists the location of the falls, most of the time what USGS topo map to use, the difficulty of getting to the falls, and a little history of the falls. The only thing I wish the authors would have included was a brief description of the hike to the falls so that you could know what to look forward to while hiking to the falls."
4,Very Good,"I don't usually buy music from artists that I hadn't heard of, but I thought I'd give Jack Knight a try. I was not disappointed. The songs were very good. This is one of those albums that you could actually listen all the way through without skipping tracks. Although there is a strong Prince influence in Jack Knight's vocals, he does have his own style. It is unfortunate that this album did not chart very well. I believe that if given the right promotional push by the record label, this album would have easily gone platinum."
3,"""Hubris""","I have read only a portion of ""The History of Israel,"" not for lack of interest but for lack of time. I cannot judge the con-tents as to their accuracy. But I will say that I am put off by the title. Every historian knows that there is no such thing as ""The History,"" there is only ""A History,"" reflecting the author's point of view. The ""historian"" that wrote this book is guilty of hubris. Nothing more needs be said."
1,musical dreams,"Diana Ballantyne is purusing the virtually impossible dream of becoming a composer and concert pianist in late 19th century Vienna. She has one year to fulfill this dream before her father calls her back to England and an arranged marriage.Desperately, she tries to find any serious teacher willing to teach a woman but her attempts meet only contempt and ridicule. Finally, fate hands her a chance when she accompanies a friend to play for her singing audition and is taken as a student by Baron Lukas von Korda. Once a brilliant concert pianist himself, he must now turn to composing due to a duelling wound that has rendered his arm useless for playing.Diana spends a frustratingly long book learning about music, nurturing a tentative romance with the Baron, and trying to convince her father that she wants a serious career in music rather than an arranged marriage to a despised fiance. This one just didn't catch my attention and I just hurried through it to get to the end."
5,Blasphemy and total lack of moral fiber,Just the way I like it! This book is great for those who can take a joke without taking it too personally.
4,Cyanide and Happiness,My daughter loves these comics -- got this for her for Christmas and I'm excited to see her face when she opens it. Great idea to have a book for the online fans.
1,Sad reflection on our society.,"When ""There is Something About Mary"" came out, I wondered how much deeper into the dirt we could go. I commented to a friend that perhaps one day we would include rape, incest, abortion, child abuse, pedophilia, family molestation, murder, etc. into our comedy. Well here it is. Am I the only one that finds a comic strip that has a pregnant woman saying she is pregnant then having the boyfriend kick her hard in the stomach and declare ""problem solved"" horrific? And we wonder why our next generation of adults are all unsympathetic punks who think it is funny to watch a man in a wheelchair tip over and flail about without thinking at all about helping him out.This is a book of moral desensitization, and a sad reflection of how ugly our society has become. I'd avoid this trash at all cost."
2,review of book,"Hi, this book is just a little too depressing for me. It also makes fun of the crucifixion on Christ which is very offensive and sacrilegious. ginny brown"
4,Top read,"Absolute top read, perfect for sitting on the coffee table at home and watching unsuspecting people pick it up and be appauled."
5,Funny,"Really funny clever humor. If you get offended easily, this is not for you. If you don't, you are in for a treat!"
4,Wanderlei Vs Mirko - nuff' said,"I would give this a 5 if it had more fights. If you are a fan of mma, it's a must have. Cro-cop and Silva; Ninja and Sperry; Henderson and Arona. Great dvd with lots of top fighters fighting other top fighters. It also has Quinton Jackson who is almost always exciting. Great dvd."
3,Pride FC : Armed & Ready,1. Bob Sapp vs Yoshihisa Yamamoto2. Masaaki Satake vs Quinton Jackson3. Yusuke Imamura vs Antonio Rogerio Nogueira4. Ricardo Arona vs Dan Henderson5. Mario Sperry vs Murilo Rua6. Sanae Kikuta vs Alexander Otsuka7. Wanderlei Silva vs Mirko Filipovic
3,Did not use much,Heard it was a great book and tool but had little to use it for b/cour professor was on it during classes and lectures.
4,Great summary of the Dance Sport world,"I ballroom dance competitively, and bought this book based on pre-release word-of mouth. Some of the pictures are spectacular, while a very few others are marred by spreading across two pages and thus being bound into the book's spine. Not all pictures are captioned...it would have been nice to know who everyone was, and where they were when the picture was taken. But don't let my comments deter you -- the *text* of the book is wonderful, and the pictures are very good. I felt that the descriptions of and explanations about Dance Sport were very accurate in terms of how one would explain competitive ballroom dancing to someone who's never been part of it. As far as coffee-table books go, if you're a ballroom dancer you should definitely get it. And if you're not a competitive ballroom dancer, but are curious to get a sense of what it's all about, then do get this book because it's a great summary of the DanceSport world."
5,The album that got house on the radio,"This is a fantastic album if you are a fan of house music and hip enough to know it's roots. I first heard this album when I was in highschool and was totally captivated by it. The beats and grooves are top notch, the vocals very sexy. I am glad to see it re-issued as it was impossibly rare for awhile(out of print for almost a decade). Tracks like; ""Big Fun"", ""Do you love what you feel"", and the title ""Good Life"" are dancefloor classics. This was probably the first ( and perhaps last ) real house music to ever hit the charts in america, ""Good Life"" and ""Big Fun"" got major play on the radio back then. This pre-dates Derrick Carter and much of the Chicago Scene. Inner City were contemporaries of Ten City ( also recommended if you like this sort of thing ). Unfortunately, Inner City fizzled almost as fast as they bubbled up. Shame, really, because they had a lot of potential."
1,Warning!!!,"Be forewarned, this disk is copy-protected. Wouldn't work in my computer or DVD player, it would work in a walkman. I listen to almost all my music on my computer. So I ended up ripping it just to listen to it on the computer. Great copy-protection! Just a big pain and upseting to individuals who pay for the product to listen to. The rating is based on the IQ of the idiots that manufactured this piece of crap."
5,Subversive Devotions,"I first met Pat Youngdahl 16 years ago in Green Bay, Wisconsin when she was my pastor. Her sermons have always been filled with spiritual study, love and wisdom.In ""Subversive Devotions"", Pat's first book, her words are inspiring, heartwarming, energizing, and an invitation to question. Her book is definitely a creation of words sketched with study, years of thought and review and spiritual wisdom. As you read this book you get the sense that evey word has been prayerfully thought out before the ink touched the paper.""Subversive Devotions"" encourages us to review our relationship with Jesus and God, and to relook at the love and inclusiveness of those relationships and others.This book can be used for personal or group study and spiritual growth.I found her words inspiring. As I have experienced in her sermons and retreat ministries of the past, this book literally pushed me to search and reachout in my personal, ongoing spiritual growth."
3,"Excellent sound, but bad radio reception","This box has the best sound I could find for it's size. It only has 2 disadvantages: the tuner doesn't receive signals well and you can't change the order of the cd tracks (i.e. no random or programmable buttons). I live in the northern part of San Francisco and the radio is unable to receive stations 20 miles away clearly (like 105.3). Strangely enough, I get better reception when I remove the antenna. Also, rotating the boombox seems to help."
3,Very Basic,"I thought this book would be good to add to my collection, but found it to be very basic. Good if you are just starting out and suffer from some forms of back pain but not all types,like disc injuries should be very careful with any type of bending at the waist with straight leg movements. I am a fan of yoga over all is very helpful for those trying to reduce the muscle pain but be very carful with any form of twist. Guarded recommendation."
2,Not particularly helpful,"The intent is there, but the book falls short of providing any new or helpful teaching information. As someone who has lived with scoliosis all my life, it offers very little."
1,Will never buy a Jet product again.,"Extremely disappointing. Workmanship was horrible. 1 blade door latch did work. Blade does not flow through center of table, it is very off center and not adjustable. Speed adjustment is a cumbersome 2 person job as it is impossible to tension the belts adequately by pressing down on the motor while securing the retention bolts. Riser installed crooked and not fixable. Blade rubs against return channel (made of plastic.) Descending blade guide poorly manufactured and cumbersome to adjust. Blade guides made of plastic blocks instead of metal wheels. Also arrived in with significant dent in base which chipped off a 1 cm sq of paint. I find myself using my $150 Craftsman bench top band saw whenever possible to avoid using this disappointing yet expensive purchase. The much cheaper Craftsman bench top saw has MUCH higher manufacturing standards. Will never buy a Jet product again."
2,Had issues from the start,Saw arrived on time and with no shipping damage. But saw arrived not working. The switch was not working and popped the breakers immediately. Re-wiring the switch correctly fixed the issue. Obviously Jet did not test their equipment and I am less thus impressed with the equipment overall. There is a reason Jet saws are so cheap. I wouldn't recommend.
3,Simon Meets His Match,"I enjoyed Bethia. She's clever and more than Simon's match. He doesn't know what to do with a woman who can and does take care of herself. And she in turn has to accept that she actually does need help sometimes. I liked that marriage was not the solution to the problem, which has been the modus operandi for several books in this series. Bethia marries b/c she wants to be married . . . to Simon."
1,Useless,"I recently bought this camera and, although there were detailed instructions on how to install the software, there was no software included. I called the technical support number 4 times and each time, was told I would receive software in an email. It's been 5 days and still no software. It's a cute idea, but virtually useless without software. (Incidentally, the Sakar website does not provide the downloads for this particular model either)"
1,Stay away from 5th Edition,"BAD BOOK! Not necessarily the material (although as previous reviews have correctly noted, it's no 5 star), but I would like to address the 5th Edition, hard back BOOK published by Prentice-Hall. My book has publishing errors & is poorly constructed. For example, Appendix G, which is solutions to select problems, is apparently the answers for an earlier edition - they make no sense. The book's binding is falling apart. I've had to glue mine up in order to hold it together. Now this is a new, $100+, hard back, text book! I contacted the local Prentice-Hall Rep. for my school 3 weeks ago & still no help. Save your $ on this 5th edition, if you have any other options, until Prentice-Hall corrects their quality control publishing problems (& until they ""step up to the plate"" & correct problems when they've goofed!)."
2,"exhaustive, but extremely dry","We had this book for our undergraduate course and found it to be extremely disappointing as a learning aid. The author has taken great pains to provide a exahustive coverage, but this book lacks coherence in content and is extremely dry. The book is poorly organized. The author at many places simply puts data sheets and diagrams with no adeaquate explanation. If you have previous background in Microprocessors and want a comprehensive reference this book is for you. If you are a student getting a first introduction to Microprocessors, look somewhere else."
5,When Gary Cooper Won the War,This book was written about Mary Duffe's teens years in the small town of Elmwood.The main form of entertainment was the movie theater. As you can tell Gary Cooper was her hero of the day.I am her daughter in law.
4,Handbook on charcoal making,"This Handbook on Charcoal Making is seemingly written by a historion rather than an engineer. That's OK for most because the technology for this art is so primitive. Virtually bereft of modern techniques and process controls data (which are needful), in my opinion, there is still enough information of the ancient ways in this book to design new machines and processes that are patentable. This is what I plan to do.Jerry, PE"
1,None,I'm waiting my book or Notices of Amazon because I have 6 Weeks and I don not What Happened with my purchase. Can May Help Me ?
4,The Practical Canary Handbook,"Lots of interesting information in this book, I have picked it up to get info a couple times after reading it through."
3,"Informative, Yet Lacks in Photos","I found this book to be informative as a breeder. However, if you are looking for a book that will provide photos of different species of canaries, this is not the book for you."
5,a must for canary owners,this book is very well written the writter puts in a personal touch.if you are a new canary owner this book is a must own. after you read this book all your questions will be answered about the life of a canary
3,very useful information,I ordered this book after buying a canary to learn about these birds and their care and habits. There is a lot of useful information in this publication. I wish in certain chapters that it would give more detailed information. Overall I would recommend it.
2,Fantasy in D,"Perhaps the reason why the above reviewer is enamoured of Polar AC is because it's actually ""Fantasy in D"" from the estimable live album ""First Light"". As for the remainder of the material on this CD, because I am a FH enthusiast I will only say that it's unexceptional. Very."
3,Not for those who can't dance,"I must admit that I'm not much of a dancer but this video made me feel even more clumsy than I usually feel when I'm dancing. Unless you already have rhythm, I don't recommend this. The music was pretty good though."
1,Jamaica - yes; S'wet - no,"I tend to love Michele Lemay and her choreogrpahy. The choreography itself in this video is fun. I really would not call this a work out video at all. It is a dance video and you will learn the Gumby and some other dance club moves. If you just want to dance to reggae music, buy it - I would recommend it for this. But if you are looking for a real aerobic workout, get another one of Michele Lemay's tapes. I agree that the comments by Miss Jamaica are awkward and you can really do without them. All in all, this is a short, low impact, low energy dance video."
1,"""Jamaica Me S'Wet Aerobics""","This was a waste of time and money. The instructors were more concerned about how they looked than how to INSTRUCT. I didn't even work up a sweat (maybe because I couldn't catch on). If I could return it, I WOULD!"
2,"IF YOU LIKE TO DANCE, IT'S FUN BUT...","I LOVED THE MUSIC,I LOVED THE MOVES; THAT'S IT. QUALITY OF PRODUCTION,& SOUND ...; AND I HAVE THE DVD! IF YOU HAVE NO EXPERIANCE DANCING TO REGGAE YOU WILL GET LOST IN THE WARM UP FOR THERE IS NOT ANY EXPLINATION. IN THE SECOND HALF, GUS DOES LET YOU AT LEAST KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT THOUGH. AND THEY SO NEED TO LOSE THE ""QUEEN"". NOT TO MENTION, PATRA (AND I LIKE HER!), WHO IS CLEARLY DOING HER OWN THING. I WILL USE IT BECAUSE I LIKE TO DANCE BUT LET'S FACE IT , IT'S CHEESY.SERIOUSLY, IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC AND LIKE TO GROOVE YOU CAN LOOK PAST EVERYTHING ELSE; I'M JUST SAYING DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED."
1,So Much Fluff III,"Again, this book seems to lack content, as did the previous two in this series. This book seems filled with irrelevant clipart more than actual advice. Also, the annoying editing mistakes again make numerous appearances in this book suggesting it was quite rushed. Most of the advice is completely common sense, and not what I would consider ""advanced techniques"". The book begins to go over some of the information that it needs to address, but doesn't get into near enough depth. In the three book series, Andy never really goes into bluffing, what specific odds are, what specific tells people might have, etc. If you want to get a good book, I would get the book by Ken Warren ""the winner's guide to hold'em"" which goes into much more depth, and is written much better."
1,Not a book a child can easily read,"I was expecting a book that a child in the age range 4-8 can read, per the product details. Perhaps they meant grade 4-8, but this book is difficult for my fourth grader to read. This book is best suited for students in grade 8 and above. Perhaps as low as 6th grade if they are accomplished readers."
5,From big news stories to struggles for peace,"Beautiful photos compliment lively text to present a comprehensive guide and reference to the events and ideas which have shaped the US. From big news stories to struggles for peace over the decades, the Children's Encyclopedia Of American History packs in illustrations and complimentary text to make for a revealing, attractive reference for all ages."
2,Do the Macarena - poor video & sound quality,"This tape needs to provide more information up front about it's contents. Basically, I would avoid purchasing this video. The version of Macarena music that they use has a slower tempo than the latest, more popular version. Based on what the cover looked like I should have not purchased it. They also teach you the ""train"" dance. Boy is it stupid! DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great Blessing!!!,"My brother is in a nursing home and this book is his favorite. It is a old book and when I got it for him, this was such a GREAT BLESSING. The book was in excellent cond. and came in good timing. Thank you so much!!!"
1,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools!","I don't have a problem with an author criticizing religion/hypocrisy when the truth needs to be told, but when you blaspheme Christ, and write as if you are wiser than him and treat him as a no-good scoundrel, you are entering dangerous territory. This book is neither entertaining or enlightening. It belongs in the trash!"
4,one of the most enlightening books I have read,This book should be required reading in every high school . I am amazed that I have never heard about it before . It is one of the most influential books of 20th century USA . The book's intention was to turn the reader into a better person . THIS BOOK IS WORTH EVERY PENNY .
4,It's a shame the current generation never knew this book,"In as fewest words possible , I have to praise the author here . An extremely intelligent person with an uncanny perspicacity . The chapter about jesus christ and what he really preached was most memorable . How Philip Wylie knew this even before the dicovery of the gospel of st. thomas is beyond me and shows how smart this man really was (1911 - 1971) . The book's purpose was to ""wake you up"" from the fugue which you are in from being caught up in the american way of life . If this book causes you to stand back and think , even for a moment , then it has done its duty to you , and you your duty to yourself ."
1,long...so long!,"first disappointment: it's probably 20 years old. 2nd: the only jerry herman's girl's that perform are carol channing & bea arthur (& george hearn) the rest are singers that aren't up to snuff. the 3rd: it's sooo long with too many instrumentals. do yourself a favor, rent the sondheim birthday concert video instead. it's a 5 star video!"
4,Good for fans,"Jerry Herman has become a legend by his own merits this special is filled with the best of his music, and with appearences of some of the stars that have acted in them. Is a lovely show but it doesn't have enough chorus to fullfilled the big Herman numbers. I wait for more stars but there were few. Good for Hermans an Broadway fans"
4,great late night cd,"volume 1 was a must, this is just a good cd for those late nights of hanging and talking with friends while sharing a bottle of wine. though a few tracks can/should be forwarded through..."
3,misleading,"No problems with product, arrived on time, but colors are not the same as the ones in the picture. Also, shipping was a bit over the unreasonable ($6 for 5 buttons)"
2,Half the Story,"I am a family physician who does indeed believe that there is too much medical care in the US. Nevertheless this book cannot see the forest for the trees. There are many issues where there is clearly questionable value provided by the medical industry, but I dont think that they found those. Some of the areas they have chosen, they may be quite wrong on, such as the value of lowering blood pressure. Other areas they did choose to address have not become major issues because physicians and patients are not as easily duped as they may think. I could go on for some, but lets just that the book is one sided and not very good."
2,Wasn't a fan,I wasn't the biggest fan of this book. I was required to read it for a course in my bachelor's program for nursing school.
3,not to good,I got this for my sistoer for christmas. Boy was that a mistake. The unit is big and bulky. And the battery life is horrible(12 hours). The bass is not to good eitheronce you put the volume over 3 it becomes all distorted. The headphones provided are not the greates but they are cool because they are colapsable. But the main reason for buying the unit was the remote control Wich i like very much. But what ireally hate about the unit is that when you open the cabinet it comes up i cm Then when you push it open it only opens 1/4 of the way. I would HIGHLY recomend a sony or a panasonic unit instead of this.
2,"An ""OKAY"" book - but focuses too much on poor examples","I found this book to be good in the sense that it focuses on JAVA and it's interfacing with COM. The JAVABEANS section was also good.The problem I have with the book is that it is titled ""Active Visual J++."" It's even published by Microsoft Press, so why doesn't it utilize the features of Developer's Studio?Good for an intro, but definately not a book to have to learn the scoop on the ""visual"" side of things."
2,An example driven book with little reference quality,"Although I sure the writer is a solid J++ programmer, this book doesn't do a great job of teaching Java to People that aren't accomplished C++ programmers. In the introduction the author states that only basic programming knowledge is needed and that knowledge need not be in C or C++. The author then proceeds to refer to C structures and data types throughout the entire book. This left me thinking I was missing portions of every explanation and I was indeed.If you like collecting books with nice cover graphics and that all fit on the same size shelf, stay with the microsoft press book series, otherwise go for more depth with other publishers books."
3,"Movie itself was good, but had a few areas to improve on...","I loved this episode, for the fact that I got to finally see the Gigantic! But the reason I rated it only 3 stars was the fact that by the time the Gigantic hatched the fight with Neo-Zektole was over within 3 minutes! I was expecting more, not a whole lot, but just a little more. Another reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the writers have no intention as of last I checked around November 2007, to continue the series. That's twice they've done this. They did it with the previous series that they had started over 10 years ago. But that's my review on this movie. Its still worth seeing, especially for us fans who have been around since the beginning of this whole Guyver idea who have been dying just to see the Gigantic move a finger!!"
1,Leaves something to be desire.,"Do not get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Guyver. Guyver is my favorite anime of all time, but after watching the final episode, it leaves you with this bitter taste of ""that's it?"". I still like the original series better. Even though, this new series has a deeper storyline and better animation, that's about it, the original one have more action and better fight sequence and music. This is what bothers me for this new Guyver series, if you are planning on ressurecting a series, why would you make the same mistake with its trite ending? There is no closure with this series. They ruined it. This was a waste attempt of bringing back the Guyver. Hopely, they will come up with some ways of expanding this like with the original 12 episodes where the first 6 episodes was categorized with an opening as GUYVER 1 and the last 6 episodes had a different opening as GUYVER 2."
3,You get what you pay for!,"Well all I can say is that I thought I was getting a deal but I was wrong, these headphones look and feel great. The sound is another issue though. It's a pretty hollow sound. The bass crackles and treble is low. I should have waited and got some Koss heaphones or something. The other reviews are pretty correct (the one about the bass cracking is dead on!) Consider something besides these wanna be's."
4,Very Good,"These headphones are real value for money. Very useful in my office as well as home. For all those people who really like to chill off, this piece is a excellent buy for its price which it is being offered for. I am simply in love with my JVC headphones."
1,bad sound,"I hate these headphones.Get hax570s instead!These have terrible sound quality and fit really weird. I'd just go for the HAX570s because those have so much better sound it is uncomparable. Avoid these, not worth 25 dollars!"
4,"Different, but decent","The book sets itself up like a typical location sourcebook, but there are some differences.First, the first 60 pages are an adventre entitled peacekeeper. While the adventure isn't too bad, that's not what I was looking for when I got the book.The remaining sections give info about four Native Nations. While adequate the information is a bit sketchy.So basically, if you have no preconceived notions about this book, it's worth a read. But if you just want info about the NAN's, you're gonna have to get this and NAN volume II."
5,Easy Star RC Airplane,"I have just started RC flying. So far I have about 4 hours of flying under my belt. This plane was built for beginners. It is stable and easy to fly. It is durable, I haven't really crashed it, but I have had a couple of hard landings. I have seen others crash this same model with little or no damage. I am using this plane to train with until I can move up to more complex planes. I love it."
4,"Privilege -- a thoughtful, soulful CD","Allette Brooks has created a wonderful CD that should appeal to a variety of musical tastes. Allette is a modern day folk singer who has been influenced by many artists including Sarah McLachlan and Ani DiFranco. The pop-ish ""ladder"" is complemented by hauntingly beautiful songs like ""hello"" and ""clothesline."" The songs ""swallow"" and ""privilege"" have a grittier sound to them. ""Passage of time"" is simply a fantastic song about the difficulty of getting over someone - it conveys a sense of longing and loss while managing to remain upbeat. Allette blends narrative with emotion so that sometimes its hard to tell whether she is using metaphor or speaking literally, leading to thought-provoking confusion. Some of the songs can seem a bit preachy, but Allette's lovely voice and intelligent lyrics are worth listening to."
4,Unguarded,"The video is very informative on the look of addiction. I use it in groups to show that anyone is subject to addiction. Unfortunatly, the video won't play on my laptop so I'm bound to just using it on a stationary system."
2,"Too Short, Great Photos","Make sure you look at things like the number of pages before you buy books. This book only has 16. That is pretty short unless you are a 5 year old. I will say that this book has great photos of many different species of jellyfish. But it has almost zero information about them. I think children would like this book very much, but if you actually want to learn about jellyfish or collect a LOT of photos, get a bigger more substanial work."
4,A very useful manual for biginners that study piano,This book helps a lot who are playind the piano. It is useful for biginners and intermediate levels. I recommend it for piano teacher and students
5,Great book for intermediate to advanced intermediate pianists,"This book is a great collection of standard repertoire for intermediate to advanced intermediate level pianists. This edition uses the same cover as the original edition from the 50's, giving it a nicely retro look."
4,Good text,"I always recommend Kleinrock's ""Queueing systems Volume I: Theory"" to my friends for learning the basics of queueing theory. But ""Fundamentals of queueing theory"" is an excellent text to have. I find it much easier to find the necessary pages to refresh my memory on an equation or a specific approach to solving a problem when using Gross and Harris."
1,Undefined variables. Poorly explained concepts,"I took a course in queuing theory using this book (graduate level). The first few chapters of the book are alright but after that the author throws in undefined variables and skips dozens of steps. It reminds me of looking over someones shoulder as they mumble to themselves and I'm trying to figure out what their doing or what steps they are taking. I have no idea how this book got so many good reviews! I'm guessing that they are from professors who already know queuing theory and probably don't need the book anyways. Add on to that my professor did not teach the class but expected the grad students to teach it to each other. It was a nightmare. ""excercises"" in the book take hours to do even for someone familiar with the field and at the end you have no idea if you've done it right or wrong. - no solutions manual for steps. RUN FROM THIS BOOK"
3,"Bone Crunching, Balls to the Wall Rock n' Roll!","Still holds up as some of the best straight ahead, searing hard rock from any decade! Darby Mills is one of the best rock vocalists, male or female, ever to put down sound in a recording studio. And she sounds the same today! Great album!"
2,The Homer Book,Disappointing. I was expecting more than just a listing of not even the best Homerisms.
3,I never got this item...,"I ordered it as a Christmas gift, but it became back ordered a few weeks after I placed my order. I'm sure it's quite good though."
5,Thank you!!!!!,"Thank you soooooo much for the fast shipping! I love the book! Sorry it took so long to review......:) But anyways, Good luck selling other stuff on Amazon!From,A statisfied Buyer,Nelly"
2,OK,"Not exactly what i expected. Some things in this book do not seem to match up with the show itself. But over all, for the price not too bad."
5,I was hooked by the characters and the story,"This book starts slowly, but by half way through I was so hooked I had to read on without a break. I felt I already knew Charlie, who tells the story, and I was fascinated by her obstinate (and intelligent) younger brother Jerry.The book deals with friendship, secrets, morality, family discipline, mental illness and urban street life. It has strong, believable characters, and it allows the reader to make up his or her mind about who's right and who's wrong.I also loved some of the dialog:""I want to feel the dark against my skin"". Jerry says, explaining why he wants to go outside at night.The book builds up to a dramatic and scary climax, that will keep you involved, make you sad, and will give you a lot to think about."
2,Don't be fooled...,"Please think twice before buying this DVD. It's comparisons to the Mad Max trilogy and any Sergio Leone western are near blasphemy and if you believe that's what you're about to watch, you'll be very dissapointed. The GGI special effects they used for most of the scenery and backdrops is horrible...horrible. The acting is awful and the costumes/ wardrobe are pathetic. Believe me when I say I'm a huge fan of B and low budget movies but Planetfall is nowhere near B or cult movie status or even cheap entertainment. I know this movie had a super low budget but part of the charm of a low budget film is that it makes up for it with good acting and characters and a cool story. The 2 women cast in the lead roles couldn't act their way out of a paper bag and their lame characters are hardly strong enough to carry this film. Don't waste your money."
4,I'm impressed,"If the extra materials on the disc are to be believed, and the movie was actually made for next to nothing, I think this is showing the kind of technical quality that indie filmmakers need to try for.Sure, the movie has all the earmarks of low budget... cheesy props, stilted dialogue, bad acting (and good acting too), and some hairpin turns that leave you scratching your head, but overall the film looks like it was made by people who cared about what they were doingand were having some fun while they did it. Trying ot compare this movie with, say, Serenity (a similarly themed sci-fi sort of thing) would be impossible considering the huge budget gap you'd have to allow for. And frankly, Serenity didn't do this well with the millions they had!And peaking of extras, I don't think I've ever seen an indie DVD with this much extra stuff on it. Its like they spent more time on the extras than on the actual film! So if extras are a selling point for you, you won't be disappointed."
1,Best thing was the DVD case art...,"This looked sort of interesting, so I bought it. Once I got it, the description on the DVD case made it even more intriguing. Unfortunately, the plot (?) was bad, and the acting worse. I can stomach a lot, and am a fan of a lot of grade B Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of the worst movies I've seen. I kept waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen. Nothing did. This was obviously an amateur production on no budget, but it was a waste of film/tape.Don't waste your money."
4,SPICY JAZZ,"This 1968 recording by Pepper Adams proves (once again) what a master he was on the less popular baritone sax. There's no heavy-handedness in his playing whatsoever, rather, he plays in a swinging, soulful mood, sometimes gruff, but always melodic. The presence of tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims is a nice touch : nobody could ever create a more smooth sound on the horn; absolute masters like Ben Webster or Ike Quebec may have equalled him with their own particular sound, but never surpassed him, as he never sounded like nobody but himself. Add Tommy Flanagan on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, and you know this has to be a great union of top jazzmen, and it is ! A set which is made up largely of originals and fairly recent compositions by the likes of Joe Henderson and Thad Jones, this is no run-of-the-mill jam session, rather a beautifully crafted showcase for the talent of these five greats."
4,"I was disappointed by this so-called ""encounter"" between two of my","favorite musicians when I bought the LP, since it sounded to me as if they were playing in different studios at different times. Zoot sounded over-heated from the start, as he's done on other sessions (e.g. the one with Hackett) when he's apparently been called upon to run out the changes and the clock."
3,Fairly good blowing session,"Pepper Adams is one of the great baritone sax players, but he never seemed to be able to make a great album on his own. There is good playing all around, and Zoot Sims makes an interesting, if not completely effective countervoice to Adams' booming bari. However, there is never an excess of excitement, and the momentum just isn't there. A good addition for Pepper Adams fans, but otherwise disappointing."
4,"Yummy, but...","These cheese straws are very yummy. Unfortunately, I felt that they were making me gain weight as part of my low carb diet. I gained three pounds in the week that I bought them eating maybe a couple of handfuls a day. So, while very delicious, they may not work well for my diet.Update: I see that the product Amazon took me to write this review was not exactly the product I ordered. I ordered the low carb tin."
3,Too Short!!!,"My boys (3 & 6) like the content. They are airplane and jet fighter fanatics. However, before you buy this dvd, you should know that the running time is only 25 minutes. Usually, I sit them in front of a good dvd as ""babysitting"" and 25 minutes isn't enough time to get anything done! It's also a lot of money to pay for a 25 minute dvd of low quality (picture & sound ... not content). I probably wouldn't buy this again if I had known how short it was."
1,Misleading.,"I purchased this item with the intent on it being a birthday present for a boy turning 2 years old. The picture that was shown gave the impression that the lego pieces were fairly large. When the item arrived at my house I looked at it and was completely shocked at how small the lego's actually were. I had to spend more money on another present because the lego's were way out of his age range, and way to small to be safe for someone his age, or even older. I was disappointed and I feel that there was some misrepresentation of the item. I still have it in my closet, unopened, and the reason I didn't send it back for my money back is because I would have spent the same to ship it back and I would have been refunded. So definately overall it was a bad experience."
4,Blocks,"I like this toy, Only thing is I thought they were bigger blocks so having a 3 year old play with these tiny little things isn't recommended..."
5,Voice of an angel,"This cd is a delightful addition to my collection. I first read about it in a cabaret email newsletter and it took me awhile to find it. I've already listened to it several times. She takes you on a lovely ride with her lyrical voice. Great selection of songs, too. A must-have for lovers of cabaret."
1,Incredibly tedious,"I laugh at this song. Who'd they sample the horn from, Kenny G? Should you wish to hear the lyrics, ""If you're fond of sand dunes and salt sea air/And quaint little villages here and there"" endlessly repeated for minutes on end, by all means grab it. I actually felt myself aging as I listened to this swill.I happen to like sand dunes, salt sea air and even (gasp!) quaint little villages here and there. This song just about ruined all of that for me. And what does all that have to do with rivers, anyway?Groove Armada should be ashamed of themselves."
3,Good information but not enough of it.,"All the information provided was very good including information on size, water conditions, the origin of the fish and their temperament (agressive, social etc.) I would have liked a little more on the behavior of the fish and potentially less on spawning but that is really just because I'm not currently interested in breeding fish. Each listing has quite a bit of info along with lots of big full-color photos. (some of the colors on the fish seem like they were added in and some fish were probably not among the living during their photo-shoot. But they definitely let you see exactly what the fish looks like)My only complaint is there were many fish that I wanted to find out about (fairly common ones at that) that were not listed. I like the book and the price is right I just wish there was more of it. The content is good but there aren't enough listings to really consider this a complete reference by any means. Maybe a volume two?"
5,dragon5,This is a wonderful book to learn how to do pen and ink buildings. Claudia Nice is a very good pen and ink artist! Her books are very nice and I enjoy them very much.
4,Information was not blown up,I order this set of inks and you just about have to have a magnify glass to read it. I was wondering why the ink was not working and when I read it they want you to open the air port on the top where the tape is and the refill was done for it to work it was like it would make the ink dry quicker but they gave you enough ink to last a long while.I gave it good report far as the delivery but not on tracking. the delivery was early
3,a lil too big...,cud have been a lil more smaller...feels like it occupies the whole room. the mattress does not hold to it...keeps sliding all the time
5,UFO Showtime,"Showtime is a must for any hardcore UFO fan. I saw UFO this summer during their US tour in a small venue and it was a great show. This DVD was recorded just before they began the US tour. Great audio and image quality. All the best hits are here except for ""Natural Thing,"" which is unfortunate since it one of my favorites. If you like UFO you'll love this DVD!"
5,Mogg is the man,"Mogg is awesome in this live double DVD spectacular. What is the beef w/ UFO playing SITN songs? I don't get it. Considered by many as one of the all time best live concert albums and folks are complaining that they play these SITN songs live? I guess VH shouldn't play anything off of their first album, and heaven forbid if Deep Purple played anything from Machine Head in concert!This is the ONLY 'real' UFO DVD out there - so I personally want to see/hear the SITN songs. 200 minutes of material and people still complain about where is 'this' and where is 'that'. Geez.Awesome DVD set that is long, long, long overdue. Great sound, picture quality you can't go wrong here. (unless you want some of the sub standard Chapman era stuff...)"
4,Pretty darn good,"This was a great show, for the age of Phil Mogg. I'm a huge fan of UFO having seen them twice in 70's At their prime. He just can't really hit the notes like he used to. Also Pete Way is kind of washed up. On the bright side, the rest of the young guys they have added to the band really pull it together to bring back all the memories of my youth. Young Jason Bonham really bangs the kit like his Dad, he made UFO's drum parts as clear and loud as I have ever heard them. Great to see him in the band. Vinnie Moore truly amazed me, he is just awesome! He tirelessly riffed out every note perfectly, then tore the house of convention down with his own take on the Solo's. I can't say enough how this guy surprised me, he is a great player. which made this DVD totally worth owning. The only thing is Phil Mogg just can't hang anymore. I would like to see what a young fresh voice could do with those vocals. I still Loved this DVD and would say buy it to any UFO fans still out there."
4,WTF? Still no Chapman era songs?,"OK, I'm going to buy this. But you have to wonder what is going on here. The excuse used for years was that Schenker refused to play Chapman era songs. Lame as hell, but what are you gonna do? So now they are past that excuse and the set list still reads like Strangers In The Night plus some of the new stuff. I just don't get it. Chapman era stuff was some of the strongest the band ever did. I hate that they refuse to acknowledge it."
3,Not what I was hoping for,I wish this DVD was more in their hey-day. UFO rocked when in their prime. I wasnt overly impressed with this DVD.
3,mixed bag,"I bought these after reading some good reviews and found that they worked well with my home stereo but there was always some background noise. They did not work with my sony MD player and that was the main reason for me buying them. If you are not to picky and just like loud music these are surprisingly good. They are also very comfortable. However, for more complex and or subtle listening it would be wiser in the long run to go up the ladder a bit."
4,"Not the best, but good anyway.","For $..., I suppose these JVC HAV560 are pretty darn good. They offer good frequency range with well defined high's, decent mid range and solid bass delivery. The 40mm drivers seem to need a little more juice to fully hammer your eardrums, but should be fine for most sound sources. They are light and comfortable although I think I'd prefer a tighter fit and perhaps more rugged wires asn these are just a little thin. As usual I am partial to the in line volume control which these headphones have. All in all I think they are a bargain."
3,Not for portables,"I purchased these pair of headphones for both my home stereo and portable stereo needs. The sound quality was better than average - and for it's price excellent - when listening to a home stereo system. However I would definately NOT recommend purchasing these headphones if you plan to listen to portables. I listened through my portable CD player and minidisc player and found that I needed to turn the volume nearly to it's max to hear music at the proper level. It seems to deliver the high and low frequencies well, but the midrange is quite low.The earpieces are probably the most confortable that I've ever used, but the 9 foot chord is way too long."
1,Not the Holly Hobbie you know and love,"Different voices, different animation, and poor story lines. My family and I loved the previous Holly movies. This one was terrible. Rent if you must but wait to buy it."
1,Very disappointing!,"I agree with the other reviews. This DVD was a big disappointment for us. I like the Hollie Hobbie DVDs because they appeal to my older daughter without having the sassy attitude of other ""older"" kids shows. (iCarly, et al). Not only was the story very disjointed but the innocence wasn't quite there. The voices were annoying--especially when ""Hollie"" sings (the songs on the other DVDs are good!). My kids like it, but not as much as the previous DVDs."
1,A Let Down,"The other four Holly Hobbie stories were excellent, my kids adore them. This one is awful in comparison. New voices, shoddy animation and stupid songs. If there are going to be any more Holly Hobbie animated films, the next one better be great to make up for this one."
1,Pretty Disapointed,"I have to say my wife and I are pretty disappointed with the latest release in the Holly Hobbie series Fabulous Fashion Show. The animation is not as crisp and clear. The voices for ALL of the characters changed so much my kids got up mid way and stopped watching the DVD. The story line is way off from previous story lines. It lost its warm, happy, helpful theme that was so prevalent in the previous series. If this continues to be the new direction of the series I doubt my wife and I will purchase any more of the Holly Hobbie Adventures."
1,Just as bad as the other reviewers are saying.,"Horrible storyline, terrible new character, shoddy animation and voicework - I think this one is going to get ""lost"" so my girls don't absorb the poor quality and message of this movie. It's a real shame because, while I found the other Holly movies saccharine, they were beloved by my three girls and I though they were a nice addition to our DVD library. This one? Notatall."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"We've thoroughly enjoyed the previous Holly Hobbie shows - good voices, good story, good animation. This DVD isn't anywhere near the quality of the others. They changed all the voices, threw together the animation, weren't true to the heart of the characters or the quality plot lines. Wish I could return it - my 7 years old was so unhappy, and so was I. If this is the direction they are taking the Holly Hobbie shows then I won't purchase anymore!"
1,want my money back!,"My daugher and I just watched this movie and it was bad. I agree with the other reviews. The voices are all wrong and the songs don't even go with the story. Singing voices are not the same as the talking ones and it is very obvious. WOW. We are really unhappy as we loved the previous movies. Why change a good thing? Oh well, they need to bring back the original cast."
1,Not the same =(,"We have ALL of the Holly Hobbie dvds and this one was SUCH a disappointment. I read a previous review that said her 5 yr old noticed the difference- well my 5 year old did and walk out to go play in her room! She LOVES Holly Hobbie and she walked out 5 mins into this one. I feel jipped! She just keeps saying ""Mommy, it's different. They all sound different.""POOR animation, POOR voicing, POOR song choices, POOR writing! HUGE disappointment. I do NOT recommend this movie at all!"
1,soooooo disapointed!!!!,"I agree with everyone else, what have they done!!! I loved all the movies untill voices changed (very bad now) adn the quality of the whole production went down the tubes. It is so sad!!! I am trying to find out who at Sony to give the feedback to, hope it is not to late (probably) to change it all back!!!!!!"
5,I absolutely love this book,"This is truly one of the finest books I've ever experienced and I can't reccommend it enough. It has heart, passion and intelligence and tackles one of the most hotly debated topics confronting humankind today in a gentle, nonjudgmental manner, allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions. Kudos to the author!"
3,Part 4 is out!!!!,"Funny, I bought this as an import, and now that part 4 is out I am kicking myself in the arse. This version contains ALOT of Japanese text, so if yur like me, you'll get lost. The new one has less and no mode where you have to answer questions in japanese.....you can see why it can get frustrating, cest pais?"
2,pretty weak,"songs lack verse, chorus, verse or any real structure. Vocals, while powerful, are pretty annoying."
4,Good Hands,"Ray Bryant was a two handed pianist who could play with the best of them. His solo albums are classic ""down home"" swinging affairs that deserve a place in all jazz afficidos libraries."
3,Bought it out of need,"Got this book for class.What can I say, it does what an academic text book is supposed to do. Nothing more and nothing less."
2,do not lie,u said ur book was brand new. but its not. its used...there are scribbles everywhere on the textbook and some pages were folded up weirdly. and the CD was definitely used as well. DONT LIE on amazon.
4,Also in another book of Hua Ching Ni,"These are 64 wonderful stories. But.... they are also in the marvelous book of Hua Ching Ni: I Ching: The Book of Changes and the Universal Truth. I only discovered this when I bought both of them. So if you don't want things twice, be aware."
3,Misleading item discription.,The title for these headphones should read 'PSP Headphones for PSP 1000/2000' not for the PSP-3000.
2,PSP 1000 edition white headphones with remote,This purchase disappointed me because amazon did not tell me that it was only compatible with the psp 1000 edition and is pretty useless for the psp 2000 edition.
4,Love the remote,I bought these to replace the ones I lost and they worked great. I love the remote control and use it with my Shure earphones.
2,The head phones .,"I got it as a christmas gift for my boyfriend's psp and the headphones didn't even fit in it. And they were just weird. I will not be buying headphones like these again, I thought they were good ones but I guess we can use them for something else."
4,PSP falling short,"If you're watching movies on your PSP or playing games where it's critical to clearly hear what's going on the PSP is a huge dissapointment. It just plain and simple doesn't offer enough volume. However, these head phones do help! They don't offer as much volume as I'd like, but they do help to remedy to overall problem with the PSP. They are good headphones that hold up to rough conditions. They have a volume control, etc. right on the head phone line which surprisingly is kind of handy now and then. They help, but Sony really needs to do something with the PSP system to give players more VOLUME!!!"
3,Is Good,"I not read the feature of this product, and i have PSP Slim 2000, and this product not can use with this model of psp. I not can evaluate because i can't use it."
2,Uncomfortable,"As previously mentioned, very uncomfortable. Why they thought people wouldn't want cushioning is beyond me. Sound quality is mediocore and I couldn't find a use for the remote. I don't use my PSP as an mp3 player really so your milage may vary."
3,This could be better,"Summarizing what other have said: The cord is too long, no foam comfort pads, but at least you can connect other earphones (making it larger) if you fell it much uncomfortable. The sound is ok. Another problem I found is the clip. If you are already hearing music and you want to put the control in your shirt or wherever using the clip you probably will press the control buttons."
5,Great quality sound and you can still hear what's going on around you.....,"These earbuds are actually louder than I thought they were going to be. The sound quality is great and it seems to be sharper than other headphones. Another thing I liked about them was that nobody can hear what you are listening to, unlike other large headphones. If the stuff you listen to is private, then these are great for you, the buds need to be in your ears to hear anything. If they are just dangling, even with the volume all the way up, you really can't make out what is being said. With the music on pause, you can hear what's happening around you just fine, which also makes them safer.All in all, if you still have an old phat PSP (PSP-1000), then these are great headphones. Don't buy these if you have a slim PSP or newer, they won't work."
1,I can't hear you!,These headphones are ear friendly You CANNOT hear a thing through them because they will not go above a certain levelTERRIBLE
3,Remote Won't Work,"Tried to make the remote control to work, but it just won't work. Audio is always set to maximum and I can't get the remote control to actually control the audio and skip tracks. Headphones have an excellent audio quality though, so I'm using them without the remote."
1,Not happy.,"An awesome idea but the earphones did not fit my PSP as advertised, the plug-in was different. I am here in Afghanistan so I ate the loss. Not happy."
4,PSP Accesories,They would've worked if i had the PSP model it was meant for but it was my mistake not looking carefully. This is for PSP 2000 not 3000. I ordered the ones for PSP 3000 and they work fine except changing certain song might seem static like.
2,Not official PSP Remote,"~~~~NOT THE OFFICIAL PSP REMOTE~~~~The remote seemed just a little (little) bigger than my older (broken) PSP remote. It's not the official PSP remote, but it does the work I expected it to do. Hopefully, it will last 3-4 years through heavy rain and sun like my old (official PS) one...About 1 month into owning this remote control, the play button to turn on the PSP isn't working. So, I have to manually turn on the PSP, and then the PSP remote will do its thing."
2,Good and evil,"These headphones are great if you are into really long headphones. The problem is if you are traveling, walking these are totally not the headphones that you want. But if you are sitting at home and you don't care if the wires are all tangled around you than these are perfect. The best part is that they stay good in your ears and have good sound."
1,it's fake no buy!! caution,"hi, i buy this product for my psp300 and no fit in the psp te conector is big, is incredible what amazon sale this products fakes..i see the original in bestbuy ..and beliveme is diferent!. ok"
2,PSP Headphones with Remote Control,"This item look great but actually its not. the button are cheap mine stop workin after a month of just pressing next track, its not sturdy. The ear piece are hurt my ear."
2,Is this an original????,"They're great sending the product and was kept well informed, Price was good, whoever the quality of the remote seems strange. I have used hundreds of Sony Products and this one seems very cheap in it's construction. I suspect that's a Chinese version. My main reason for the purchase was to be able to chat over SOCOM however....it wont do it even though I remove all security settings as instructed. I have my doubts on the quality of the product."
3,so so,"This product is ""OK"" at best. What attracted me to this in the first place was that it was white because I was tired of the same black color in most headphones and I wanted to add a different character to my PSP... and I liked the fact that it has a remote. The sound quality is not at all great especially when I travel. The cord is too long making it tangle up more. I've read that some people like this product and from that, all the power to them. But this is not for me."
3,headphones are great!,"I am using just the headphones for portable audio devices. They fit comfortably in the ear and have a crisp, clear tone with good base. I recomend these headphones for either PSP or for your Audio needs. I am rating this game as 3 and 3 because I do not have the PSP, but bought just the headphones because they were on sale. I do like Sony products - have good quality control and good circuits."
3,Sony PSP Headphones with Remote Control,The headphones are crappy but the remote works well. I would buy this item and keep the remote and buy new headphones.
2,Better than nothing - but that's just about it!,"The build quality is fine. But the problem with these earpones is that they won't go over 90db - as they're ""ear friendly"", as Sony calls them. I use them in bed at night, so they're fine as there are no noises around - but they're no good in a noisy enviroment!"
5,cooool,i love it ..i just got it brand new and speaks from itselfvery useful with other headphones ..better if those are sony
5,You Go Jen,"Playboy / Best of Jenny McCarthy is 58 minutes long and was released on video on June 4, 1996. Of the three Best of videos this is one of the better ones. Only two minutes is dedicated to her early life and how she went on to become Playmate of the Month then Playmate of the Year. The rest of the video is showing her in different scenes taking off her clothes and showing herself in the nude. Pamela Anderson in her The Best of video was very conservative about showing herself in the nude and her video was more of question and answer video. The only scenes that I hated were the race track, angel, and pool hall. All the other shorts the clothes came off. Only wish we could have seen her more in her birthday suit. Playboy / Best of Jenny McCarthy get an A-."
4,Jenny McCarthy is so hot...!,"Simply, when i saw her nude first time, i forgot other ladies. His entire body is alarming, she is a perfect female figure, i have ever seen...! All sequences are very well shot, and the best one is that at billiard table, so hot, sexy and stimulating...!"
4,"It was good, but if you love Jenny McCarthy grab it.","I enjoyed it, but there was only like 4-5 actuale scenes, but they were like at least 6 minutes long, which is fine. Also, they mostly talk about her life. It worth it, but only for a while."
3,Not enough Jenny,"I think the video was okay, but there was too much about her life etc. Also, the videos were cut into pieces, making them hard to follow."
3,Almost the same as the video centerfold,"I would say unless your a huge Jenny McCarthy fan, dont buy. It's ok I guess. I got this and the video centerfold and found out that it's almost exactly the same. It just has a few different scenes."
3,not quite what I expected,I'm a fan but I guess I expected different. Too cheesy for me...I guess she was meant to be seen and not heard/narrated. Go for her in lingerie only. This was more of her rambling and reading off her bio.
4,Good DVD,"I've watched almost this whole set and it's been good quality, and it was in good condition. It's exactly the same as I remember it on Nickelodeon. As someone said earlier though, this DVD set is just the shows and nothing else like a normal series release would be. But the important thing is the shows are good. The only complaint I have is that...this is not all of season 2! This is actually half of Season 2. I'm hoping they're going to release a second half of season 2, because that's only fair. Still, I must say I've really enjoed the disk, and it was worth the money. It's rugrats in their prime, when the plots were still good and they didn't add a bunch of lame characters or new animation. I'm looking forward to the second half of season 2 and then season 3!"
5,one of the best shows,"one of the best shows for kids i grew up with it and wish to pass it on to future generations however i wish it was a proper dvd release not on a recorded dvd i hope to see the future seasons properly released in stores and reasonably priced,the $35 asking price exclusively for an amazon release is uncalled for especially since there are no special features and the fact on episode on tv consist of two segments and this release counts each segment as it's own episode, despite the corporate rip-off the series is too special too pass up and i do recommend it. I also recommend that people request a proper reasonably priced release from nickelodeon."
3,I will buy when...,"They release the last half of season 2 (making a full set). I'm sure they have access to all of them, considering they have released so many other complete seasons of Nickelodeon shows (Danny Phantom, Fairly Oddparents,etc), so I'm sure it is only a matter of time, if more people demand it enough. I love the Rugrats and i wish to own every episode. I'm either going to have to buy a TON of VHS tapes then record them to DVD, or find a way to download from YouTube or somehow! They should also do the same for Rugrats: Best of Season 9. Again only missing about 4 episodes. Call it ""The Rest of Season 2"". As long as they can do it, and make money, I'm sure they will."
1,Season 2 Part 1,DO NOT BUY YET. It's half of season 2. There's like 12 episodes missing. Don't pay $35 for half a season. Somebody's trying to rip us off.
2,Overpriced,"Think about it for just a second. They're charging almost the exact same price as Season 3 and that has all of it's episodes whereas this one only has half. HALF. Amazon, if I were you, I'd seriously cut the price for this one. Unless you do decide to release the entire season, this thing needs to have it's cost pushed down to at least $17. Okay, I love Rugrats, I really do but if you're going to release a season set, make sure you release the whole thing. I can say the same thing about Rugrats Season 9 and Doug Season 4 (Which the only thing that made that one ""Best of"" is that they didn't add one episode. Yeah, I'm serious). So, Amazon, please don't screw over your customers and just give these season sets all of their episodes."
3,"Good season, but not all there!","I bought this DVD season for my girlfriend because she loved the Rugrats when she was younger and still does. I was a little disappointed that only half the season was there! I guess it was my fault for not reading entirely, but for all others, this is NOT the full season!"
4,Good but not great,"I say good because it does have 26 episodes, 15 ish mins. But the second season has 50 episodes and one special. When I say episode again I am talking about each time the title comes up, not the theme song. Now I would have expected some second set of dvds for the second half of season two but I also then expect seasons 3-9 to be comming out soon. Since a large amount of ppl bought these dvds they would buy the others.About the actual dvds, great condition and the picture is of better quality than when suited on tv. I am very pleased with them other than mentioned above. I watch them all the time"
5,I really miss the old Nickelodeon!,"This is still one of my favorite shows. I really miss the old Nickelodeon, because the new Nickelodeon is a bunch of crap with all of the Icarley and other things! I wish the old Nickelodeon would come back. When we would wake up in the morning with our favorite Nicktoons like Rugrats, Doug, ect. The old Nickelodeon was a lot more fun to watch back then. My best idea would be... if there was a channel called Nick Rewind, it would play all of the old Nickelodeon shows we all know and love!RUGRATS AND THE OLD NICKELODEON RULES!!!"
2,"THESE ""SEASONS"" ARE NOT LABELLED CORRECTLY","I love Rugrats, and I think it's great that Amazon is making them available to all through their instant video service. Unfortunately, these are just random episodes put together in 14 half-episode chunks. THESE ARE NOT FULL SEASONS OF RUGRATS, NOR ARE THEY IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER. It looks like they are each supposed to be a ""Best of ____"" collection, but the title of the collection is ""Rugrats Season __"". This is misleading, PLEASE CHANGE THIS!"
2,"If you're looking for a complete season, don't bother!","I would really give two and a half stars and thats not to Amazon! That's to the creators of Rugrats! The show is of course awesome but only including HALF the season is not! Back when I first bought this item it didn't include ""Best of"" at all so I personally was misled... but what is also upsetting is that they didn't just carefully pick the ""best of"" season 2.... they just cut them right down the middle!... So it's the exact first half that is only on the dvd, not the second. The second half includes my most favorite episodes! (and yes the one that INTRODUCES SUSIE) How are you gonna leave that out of the ""best of"".... Shame on you Amazon....I think its fine if they want to split them up and the price is fair but just release the second half! please :)??"
3,So Happy!!! Until...,"I LOVE Rugrats, so when I got this as a present for Christmas a couple years back, I was ECSTATIC. However, it has been brought to my attention that not ALL of the episodes are present. What gives, Amazon? I'm still in love with my DVD set, but it would only make sense for Amazon to release ""part 2,"" or re-release the DVD set. WE'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. Same with Season 9. Come on Amazon... Please?"
3,Not her best work,I enjoyed the CD and still listen to a song or two. I enjoyed the songs better when I heard her sing them live. There is nothing memorable about this CD.
2,Can she EVER be understood in the studio?,"I just don't understand...Phoebe Snow is one of the most talented musicians ever to come along, yet her studio work is hit-and-miss, at best, with far more misses than hits.This album is no exception. Most of the songs simply crawl along like dysthymic disorder, with no identifiable purpose. This is unfortunate, because when she POPS, no one connects better with an audience. Live versions of ""At Last"" and ""Good Times"" will clear up any doubt about this.Will there ever be a ""PHEOBE LIVE"" CD?"
1,makes too much noise,I just used this item today for the first time. The fan makes so much noise you would not use it in your car. It would be very annoying. I plan on returning it as soon as i can.
1,Cannot run an Xbox in a car...,"I purchased this unit as I have a DC 9 inch tv, and I wanted to play DVD's on it using my Xbox for the kids. The only thing I plugged into the Inverter was the Xbox, and the TV was plugged into another lighter spot, but was not turned on. Almost every time I turned on the Xbox the Inverter would shut down with the LCD saying ""low"". And that was even with the car running. When it did stay on the LCD screen said that the Xbox was pulling only 55 watts which is way below the rated capacity. The unit would not run at all with the car off, and was hit or miss with car on....Save your money!!"
2,Not good for some tape,"This tape dispenser worked well for magic/opaque tape. However, when I tried to use it with clear tape the serrated edge would not cut without using two hands. Even with two hands I found it would drag on the tape before basically ripping an uneven edge. It is possible that I received a dull blade."
5,A good looking item for your desk-top:,"This dispenser has a nice look and feel to it, easy to fill and use with only one hand. Does what it is made to do, which is always nice, don't you think? +JMJ+ p.s.: it really looks better than what it shows in the picture."
4,Purchased for my son to take to college,"I have not used it but I am sure that is it great, ask me again in a few months!!"
4,Two-Tone Tape Dispenser,"This is an attractive, sturdy tape dispenser. It works much better than my previous tape dispenser (the sharp edge which tears the tape broke off)!!"
3,Old favorite,"This perfume was worn by my mother for a long time and I was delighted to be able to purchase it for her again. It does smell nice, but not nearly as long lasting as it use to be. Nevertheless, I will continue to purchase it for her."
2,Arpege perfume,Arpege perfume Package arrived on time. The perfume arrived and it was very hot. This affected the smell of the product. I will not order perfume this way again. It should have been sent with cold packs. Perfume smells old and rancid. I wasted my money on this product.
1,?????,amazon's description of this item states that the ingredient is salicylic acid??I don't remember this perfume being made up of that but I'm not going to puchase it because of their description.
1,Should not be called Arpege,"I have been hoping that Arpege would become available again. I had enjoyed it for years. There is no other fragrance that comes close for me. Imagine my happiness when I discovered that it is available on the internet. I ordered it and could hardly wait for it to arrive all the while thinking that if it's a knockoff it's not going to be the same as the original, but I was hopeful anyway. When it arrived I was so disappointed to say the least. It's named Arpege but that's the only thing that is like the original. It's nothing like the original, nothing at all, and besides that it doesn't even have a pleasing fragrance of it's own. I really wonder how people get away with this. DON'T BUY IT!!"
4,Perfect size for the baby room,This was just what I was looking for to play music in the baby room. The bass sound is not as booming as I would like but the overall sound quality is very good. I don't use all of the functions this unit has but the power on and play buttons are easy to find. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy to operate small cd player.
3,"Strong on parts, weak on design","The industry behind this machine is fine - the parts, the labor, the detail, all no problem. But the design is weak. In particuarly, the sound is too narrowly directed. The front-loading of all the speakers is a poor choice for an instrument whose audience might be less than a foot away. Nonetheless, the sound is clear, and the placement of controls is better than some other models."
4,For trumpet fans,"Admittedly, this nice 1961 LP - CD does start on the hottest number (Chittlin') and doesn't sustain the heeth... But both ""Shorty"" Baker (one of the Ellingtonians) and Cheatham (in future becoming a major elder statesman of jazz) play really fine, in spite of Walter Bishop's piano being somewhat lost between the stars of the album and his own musical proclivities (he WAS one of the Charlie Parker+s pianists)...All in all, a good listening experience, although not really essential. If you believe all sorts of jazz guides I consulted (Rough Guide, All Music), Cheatham actually improved in years following this date, so I'll probably check into that. For Baker, who was the more famous one when this was recorded, there are no other small band albums mentioned in the sources I consulted, so this is a special project for him..."
4,good,ive played DW empires 5 also but this one seems to be more fun cause unlike DW's empires u actually can see what your policies do instead of just using them and wandering y they're even there. Also u can create your own character with also makes this game even more awesome
4,Good Game,"This game is pretty cool. I bought it with the assumption that it was SW2, just with strategy added on, but it is not, and that's okay. The board game isn't on this version, and the battles are on a smaller scale. However, if you know the basis of the Empires games, then you know the battles are not the main element. The other thing that is different in this version of SW2 is that there is an officer creator, which is awesome. Recommended for strategists. Not recommended for people who sit around ALL day and play video games, because it could get boring if played too often."
3,"Disc Was Sticky, Ruined my Xbox","The game seems great, but after ten minutes it froze. The disc had a sticky residue on it, which looks like it ruined the disc and my brand new xbox. Just bought the xbox last week and its toast. The description also said ""Like New"" which was completely false, an obvious fabrication. The original box the game came in was replaced with a generic one, with a sticky note inside saying ""Samurai Warrior 2 Empire"" on it.I have not had a problem with amazon or a seller on amazon before, so this was a surprise to me.Thanks So Much!"
3,Need patience,"I have painted in watercolor over 20 years. The processes described in this book are valid, however, one must have endless patience to spend the amount of time required to complete a project as directed by this author."
5,GBS strikes again!!!,"My first encounter with the b'ys was seeing the video to ""When I'm Up (I Can't Get Down) on MuchMusic via satellite TV. It was an instant attraction. Since then I have all of their albums (including the compilation RANT & ROAR). ""Turn"" now shows up less than a year later with a little bit of a different sound, but still good. It seems as though they are starting to get away from the traditional material to focus more on originals, but that's OK! My favourites are ""Trois Navires De Ble'"", ""Feel It Turn"" and ""Consequence Free"". This could win my esteemed ALBUM OF THE YEAR award, which would mark the second time I've given it to GBS."
4,Great Big Sea--the best band in the world,"I love GBS. This is a good CD, BUT...if you are a Celtic music fan that has heard about the boys then this is NOT the CD to start with. Buy ""Up"" or ""Play"" instead. That being said, this is a very good CD that does have a number of traditional songs on it, that grows on you. ""Turn"" is an aptly named CD because it was a departure for the band from their previous producer and a slight ""turn"" towards a more mainstream sound. Many great songs here, but all in all it is a ""quieter"" album for GBS, if that is possible."
5,Turn it up,These guys are incredible. One listen and you will be hooked. See them live and you won't be able to turn it off.Imagine 5000 people singing Newfie folks songs at the top of their lungs and just grooving. Life is good north of the border
5,Great folk music... Love at first sight!!!!!,"I was introduced to Great Big Sea this year... Didn't even know the band and I went to their concert in Canada... It was love at first sight. The other CD's are good, but TURN is AMAZING!!! Their songs can be really happy and you feel like jumping ( listen to Consequence Free) or they can be really touching and sad (listen Boston and Snt John's). In the same moment I bought the CD. I'm not a big fan of folk music, but I loved it. My favorite song is Boston and Snt John's. I would like to congratulate the band for this wonderful piece of work."
2,Disappointing,"GBS is too talented for this. Their previous albums (I have all of them: Canadian & US) were all 5 star efforts. They were witty, powerful, beautiful - simply rare gems. I go to see them whenever they perform nearby. But in Turn I found neither wit, power nor beauty just disconnected mediocre efforts with the notable exception of Trois Navires De Bie (that alone mitigated my feeling ripped off.) This was no Great Big Sea, there was nothing great about this. Bring the old GBS back, please!"
4,very cute album,"I had never heard of these guys before i bought this particular album, based on reviews. I was not disappointed. A really cute irish band. Thier lyrics are a lot fun."
4,Great Big Fun,"One part Gaelic Storm, one part Waterboys and one part Jimmy Buffett: that's Turn, one of the latest high-energy offerings from Great Big Sea. As usual there's some good hearty Irish cheer, some straight-ahead modern rock and an occasional ballad to make you cry over your Guinness. It's the kind of party where the dance floor is shared by fast dances, slow dances and hyper jigs in equal measure. ""Consequence Free"" could almost be a pop single, ""I'm a Rover"" is a pub floor-stomper just waiting to happen, and ""Old Brown's Daughter"" shows a four-part a-capella tune as harmonic as Queen and as soulful as the Chieftains at their best. I think you get the picture by now.. I'll just add that though there are some sad moments, the overall tone is one of blue skies, sunshine and good times with good friends. Turn up loud and enjoy."
3,The information was ok,"The book was not the best book I have read on spirit communications...and it delved a little too much into the surreal.Too much majik and not enough science. Kind of what is wrong with the paranormal investigations of today. We need more hard core scientific evidence and less ""subjective"" evidence..to prove that there is an after life ....after all.!!!Also nothing was mentioned about Sarah Estep, the mother of EVP. She has done as much for spirit commmunication as Raudive and all the other MALES mentioned!!!!"
2,A bit misleading in the title..,"You think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond, but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead. I love Konstatinos' other books, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Interesting read,"As a paranormal investigator with years of experience, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. It is well written and interesting. Konstantinos deals with each topic in enough detail to give you a solid base for your research. In my opinion, this book is a good basis for entry into the world of spirit communication. Each topic is discussed and then methods for use are outlined. The topics build on one another, which enables you to gain experience in each as you progress through them. Reading the book was fun and practicing the methods enables you to build your skills. I consider this to be a good buy."
1,A fantastic mess...must be seen to be believed,This movie could not be worse. Please resist the temptation to poke your eyes out. Just turn it off. This movie should be played in film schools everywhere as an example of what no to do. It is so bad that I'm buying a copy so that I can say that I have copy of the world's worst movie. This movie is closer to porn than anything else. But then it would be the Worst Porn Film ever. At least you can follow what's going on in porn. My review..shockingly horrible....a fantastic mess.
4,Surreal Blaxploitation Flick,"If you like art films from the late sixties like Easy Rider, If, Blow Up and Zabriskie Point you will like this film. It comes across as a bunch of disconnected vignettes meant to show how white society cannot tolerate a strong black man in its midst and will ultimately kill him for it. It lags at times, there are endless scenes of Sweet Sweetback running through the city and the desert to escape the police, but the musical soundtrack is cool and the visuals are trippy. A very important if somewhat dated film."
1,Groundbreaking? Maybe. Unwatchable? Definitely.,"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction, camera work, and editing are so awful that I could hardly even tell what was going on. (It's presumably supposed to be trippy and surreal, but instead it's merely annoying and confusing.) The acting is miserable, the script is practically nonexistent, and the music is grating and repetitive. The only thing even remotely worthwhile about the movie is that Melvin Van Peebles as Sweetback look kind of cool when he mugs for the camera. Supposedly this was a groundbreaking movie in its time (1971) because it shows that white society fears a strong black man. A worthy message, perhaps, but this movie certainly doesn't convey it effectively."
1,One of the Worst!,"This movie stinks. There is little, if any, story. Most of the time is spent watching Van Peebles running down streets, running down alleys, running across roof tops, running on/under/over/across lots of other things. The rest of it is spent with him stopping long enough to screw (not really have sex or make love; screw is the better term) women or kill white men. If a white man had made this movie, there would have been a lot of outrage expressed about how simplistic and low life the bulk of the African Americans portrayed in this poor excuse for a movie were. The only ones who can enjoy this flick are people who need a way to vent their rage, especially anti-white rage."
3,Well.....,"I think the first scene could have been left out; by today's legal standards, someone would go to jail in a heartbeat. By the 1995 law, this would be a felonious offense. It should be cut completely out of the movie as a consequence.However, the rest of the themes in the movie were reflective of their times, albeit offensive to some communities. It was a landmark film that pushed the envelope.I would just say.....clip the first scene completely and leave the rest intact."
1,Sweet Sweetback,"If you are a fan of the blaxplotation genre, this is a must see film. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is the granddaddy that started the whole movement. It was rated ""X"" for language and some pretty provocative scenes (for the times) but once you get past all that you'll want to know how Melvin Van Peebles pulled this movie off. Also features the musical score of Earth, Wind, and Fire.The behind the scenes story of the making of this film is even more interesting. Melvin's son Mario, a talented filmmaker as well tells the story in 1993's Baadasssss where he stars as his father.See them both!"
3,Hot Sex and slow crap,"Van Peebles did a good job choreographing the numerous explicit sex scenes, but he can't write a story worth a damn! Nice anti-MAN message, though... END"
1,Should Be Rated PT for Pure TRASH!,"In a way, this film is hilarious. Director Melvin Van Peebles (and Black Panther head honcho Huey Newton in his book ""To Die For the People"") foolishly tried to pass this mess off as a revolutionary flick. In reality, it is straight up pornography with some anti-cop violence thrown in for good measure. What a con job! So male prostitution and killing up the police is supposed to free somebody or make life better for oppressed people? Get real! If oscenity is defined as having ""no redeeming social value,"" then this is it!"
3,Good movie,"One of the better 1970s action movies. Lots of nudity and bad language. Overall, I liked it but there could of been more plot development. Random things like the biker scenes happened during the film."
3,wha...?,"i suppose some circles could consider this classic...i dunno. it was kind of incoherent for me. i guess if i had really immersed myself in the film things would have been better, but...yeah. most of it seems to be nudity, yelling, and running. there's probably some heavy underlying moral that my muddy video quality can't capture. ah well."
2,weid movie,"I only watch this movie because I love everything about the 70's, but this movie is not that good to me."
5,The best independent film of the 70's,"If you don't already know about this film you should. It is smart, cool and totally punk rock! Melvin Van Peebles is a hero to me. He is brilliant in everything he attempts-from novel writting(The True American is in the top ten fiction novels of the 20th century) to playwritting(BRER SOUL) to filmmaking(see the french new wave film:Story of a Three Day Pass) to option marketing-he became a millionaire. I am a filmmaker and hope to have as much energy and dynamite in one film that he has in one musical number in SWEET SWEETBACK. Seriously, Melvin, you are my hero and you inspire me greatly-look me up sometime and watch my first feature-it was inspired by you. TO ALL OTHERS-IF THIS IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REVIEW THEN GO BACK TO WATCHING MY BIG FAT BORING NON EVENTFUL FLUFF WEDDING."
1,Vile,"I have to tap into my memory banks to recall a more repulsive film. I came up with ""I Spit On Your Grave"". Director-star Melvin Van Peebles has the audacity to pawn off his nihilistic fantasies as wish fullfilment for the black population as a whole. There were a lot of artistic triumphs to emerge from so-called ""black expoitation"" genre and this is not one of them. This collage of violently misogynistic images can be attributed to the auteur himself. The film starts with Van Peebles exploiting his son Mario by showing the adolescent servicing a prostitute. The film goes downward from there. Van Peebles directorial style is hackneyed and the acting is amateur hour. Don't be fooled into thinking this is some sort of landmark film. It's unadulterated [...]"
3,Classic Josephine Baker,"I am spoiled because I heard Josephine Baker live at Carnegie Hall in the seventies and at that time her voice had the rich sometimes contralto texture that I found wonderful. So many of her recordings are the earlier ones in Paris where her voice can be a tad metallic and high pitched. This is not a complaint it is just that the lower registers of her voice are marvelous to hear. I do not think that her recording at the Bobino in Paris is available on CD but it is another example which is very fine. If you prefer the lower register voiced Josephine Baker and you would be interested in hearing her voice ""catch"" all the experience and living she has been through try ""Jospehine at Carnegie Hall"" or her ""Bobino Concert."" You should not be disappointed.This particular recording is just ""vin ordinaire"" but with Josephine Baker ""that ain't ordinary"" And for those who like the classic Josephine it should be a good choice!Thomas Lee Randleman"
1,I Wasted $20 on this cd,"I found this cd to be overly repetitve and boring. As a fan of Sasha, Digweed, Van Dyk and crew, I would recommend any album by these DJ's over this Perfecto compilation"
5,"Seb does it again (and again, and again)","Wow.I first saw Seb spin at Giant in LA a couple of years back, and he blew me away with not only his DJ skills, but also with his incredibly tight track selection that blended many styles. Over the course of the night, the set just kept getting better and better, much like this new CD does. Its got a really listenable, driving mix of epic progressive, breaks, and a handlful of nasty vocal electro-house cuts. This album is getting much car/gym rotation. It's cool to see a big DJ like Seb do something a bit different, but not so different that you get turned off by it. I now own 4 Seb mix CD's, and he has yet to dissapoint!"
1,Lame and bittersweet,"It attempts to be a humorous look at cancer treatment, but it just didn't go far. The jokes were lame and bittersweet and it just didn't fit the bill."
1,dissapointing/ not funny,I bought this to give as a gift to my aunt who has cancer. It is just all about the author. It is not funny anecdotes about cancer its her complete story written through comics. It even goes into detail about her writing the book. Its more like her own personal diary. I didn't even end up giving the gift because it wasn't even appropriate. I can't think of anyone it would be appropriate for besides the author herself.
2,"It was quite boring, wasn't very funny. Look into Jeff Dunham for laughs!","It was quite boring, wasn't very funny. The best part of the book was when her husband told her, when her hair fell out, well it's more to kiss... wonder if that really happened, but it looked good on paper... anyway.. for fun Look into Jeff Dunham for laughs!"
5,"Very funny, yet frank depiction of hair loss","Ms. Clifford captures the humor of the highly emotional experience of being treated for cancer. She focuses mostly on hair loss (hence the title), but also on radiation and chemo. Laughter is great medicine, so I suggest you add this book to the treatment regimine of any woman going through cancer treatment."
1,Not worth it.,"I read this book in about 15 minutes. While there were some humorous illustrations it was not a worthwhile read. I bought this book hoping it would help me through my situation, maybe my expectations were too high."
3,"Good, but flawed","The movie's premise is brilliant. A cantankerous, vicious, temperemental Fidel Castro is on a boat in Cuba, which gets blown up in an attempted coup. He survives on a raft, drifts with the current and wakes up in Florida. Naturally, he loses his beard and takes on another name and keeps trying to return to Cuba. The actor playing the dictator is excellent whenever the dictator, who is used to everyone being a bootlicker and jumping at his every whim, is contradicted or frustrated in his demands. If the movie had simply stayed with this story, it would have been perfect, but the problem is that a couple of parallel stories (a boy being bullied at school, infidelity between couples and an incoherent side story of arm smuggling) detract from the story. Even so, the movie is worth buying. It will give you a good laugh."
5,Buy or Fall,"Great videos; the popups are a fascinating complement. ""Stand or Fall"" is the best gem in here. It wasn't a huge hit, but the song and video are both powerful. I only wish VH-1 would release more ""pop up"" collections!"
3,"For 30 bucks, who can complain","Short form, this is a good telephone for the money. It's hard to find a speakerphone for under $40, and while I would hesitate to say this one is good, it's at least acceptable. No bells and whistles, but it gets the job done.Probably the largest deficiency is in the speakerphone volume; it just isn't loud enough. Even turned up to full volume, I have to concentrate to hear it. It's also very prone to duplex drop-out, background noise causing the coversation to cut in and out.The price was what attracted me though (probably you as well), and I knew I was buying a cheap phone. It hasn't fallen apart and the audio quality it good, so I'm pretty happy with it."
1,phone sound quality very poor,"The phone has a large amount of distortion so that it is hard to even recognize the voice of the person speaking. On speaker phone it is even worse and difficult to have a conversation.While inexpensive, it is not worth the money."
5,Great 2-line phone for the price,"Considering the price, the phone works great. It doesn't have all of the features of the more expensive phones, but you get what you pay for. For the money, this phone works great. If you just need a phone with two lines, this is it."
5,The Gristle - hilarious and so much more,"This movie is so funny. Carsten Norgaard, who is way under-rated, was a shining star here. It takes more than one time to watch it, to get how funny it is. Of course, it does address the topic of racial issues and is done in such a clever way. You don't even really realize that this is the entire focus and theme. The characters develop and grow in a way you just don't see anymore. No shoot 'em up stuff, special effects, only great quality dialogue and interaction. The scene in the motel is nothing short of hilarious. Norgaard's appearance here is worth watching period. This movie is worth it's weight in gold. It received critical acclaim for good reason. Watch it, you'll be glad you did."
5,Offbeat Sense of Humor Required,"I loved this movie from the start, but I think it takes a rather odd sense of humor to truly appreciate it.The characters are all walking cliches, say the most outrageous things, and end up in the oddest circumstances. But, suspend a bit of reality and just enjoy.The characters are hillariously drawn, the dialog full of funny one-liners, and the hotel slash bar scene where they all hook up must be seen to be appreciated.I rented it and enjoyed it so much, bought it the next day."
5,Excellent movie,"This is a very good movie. Not only is it funny and entertaining, it actually also has something to say (and not in an obvious way). This crime caper involves mistaken identities between men of various races (white, black, hispanic), and is done in such a way that it's suspenseful, humorous and profound all at the same time. Kudos to the filmmakers for creating and weaving a story that does this. The actors are all excellent too -- not only the veteran actors such as Michael Dorn and Orson Bean, but also the newer faces such as Geno Taylor. For fans of independent film, you should check this one out, and for those who only watch the typical huge-budgeted, special effects-laden Hollywood Studio movies -- instead of popping in the latest Keanu Reeves movie, give this one a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Good Work,"This film has everything! An interesting and unique plot, some great verteran actors as well as some new comers. There are some pretty funny parts. Moved at a good pace. Nice work!"
2,Hit&Miss film,this film at best is hit&Miss. alot of ideas&story lines but it doesn't have a true setting to make it all work as one. interesting vibe but is missing something for me on a whole.
5,A book worth Numerous awards,Swinging Bridges was a book that I couldn't put down. The plot reads quickly and is well planned out.Tim's writing style is Harper Lee meeting John Grisham. The suspense of the book kept me reading while the down home feeling of a small town touched on my midwest upbringings.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good suspense novel or reading about life in the midwest.
4,Adorable,"This is a beautiful little 20-page workbook teaching Jewish children the joy of mitzvot--good deeds.As it explains, there are two kinds of mitzvot--those explaining how to behave towards God and those describing how to behave towards fellow people. The book considers the latter mitzvot as a kind of journey through life.Children work through exercises that teach everything from honoring parents to doing good work at school, and keeping peace at home to visiting the sick. As the book notes, doing good deeds gives people a shem tov, a good name.This is an adorable way to introduce small kids to ideas central to Jewish life.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,Panasonic Microcassette Transcriber,I am very pleased with this product. I am also very please that I was able to find it through Amazon. The product arrived in mint condition and on time. I would use this method to purchase other items without hesitation.
