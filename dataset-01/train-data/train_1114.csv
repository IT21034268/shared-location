1,So bad that I burned it!,"I am not even going to waste the time to get into the details of this book. It was such a horrible let down and insulting piece of work. I finished reading it while at a bon-fire, and I just tossed it in."
1,Disappointed,"I love Wolfe; only one word for Charlotte - ARF!Tom needs to go re-read ""The Right Stuff"" so he can remember why people buy his books."
2,Way too much swearing,"It is offensive to read swear words every three paragraphs. I try to skip over them being the Christian that I am, but it's hard.I can relate to Charlotte""s goody goody personna and being devasted that she gave in to her lusts and then feeling guilty. There are so many men out there just like ""Hoyt"" and I wish Charlotte's father would have hunted him down and beat him for using his daughter like that. Makes you wonder what type of parents Vance, Hoyt, etc. had. They sound like rich, spoiled kids who grew up with no idea of right from wrong.Book is too long and I'm so glad I'm almost done. It's heavy to carry around for sure."
1,I wanted to like this book,"Especially after I committed all the time to read the 600+ pages. However, it was PAIN-FUL. You read and read and read and want more and expect more and then NOTHING."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I found little if anything to redeem this long laborious diatribe against the American college system. If it is intended to be satire, then it sorely lacks the humor necessary for satire to be effective. If there is a serious metaphor here, then it is so deeply buried under the moutains of useless words that a crack team of the world's best archeologists wouldn't find it.There isn't anything new here once the reader peels through the layers of over-exaggerated caricatures, and what is presented has been done better eslewhere. Once the reader slogs through this quagmire of verbiage and vitriol, the reader finds that the journey wasn't worth the effort.A personal message to the author: you are too good for this. Next time you feel the need to produce a work of this nature, try prunes first."
2,College Prof and parent of college-aged and pre-college children,"Save your money, buy a more interesting, more believable, more relevant book. It was only mildly entertaining, which is why I gave it 2 stars. First, Wolfe tries so hard to sound young and hip, that he shoe-horns into the text what he believes are phrases young people use today. I can tell you, based on my experience with college-aged people, he tried way too hard and was completely ineffective. He sounded like an old man who was trying too hard to sound young and hip.I resent how he portrays the main character: he starts off strong by telling a tale of a young woman who is bright and ready to take on the world, then turns her into a confused, weak, babbling idiot who LIVES for the Big Man on Campus. More disturbing is how he portrays date rape...his amazingly cavalier attitude is disgusting.I kept waiting for the ""good part(s)"" to happen. I was still searching for it after I read the last page."
1,horrible book,"i love tom wolfe, and i ignored all of the negative reviews on this sight because of that. do not make my mistake. this book is awful. the characters are unlikable and i don't care what happens to any of them. i actually don't think anything is going to happen, i have 100 pages to go and nothing has really happened yet. just a bunch of rambling. do not buy this book."
3,"""Bango""?","This book reads pretty much like what it is: a clever 70-something trying to capture the language and culture of today's college students. The story is OK, but you couldn't exactly call Wolfe the authentically insouciant and ironic voice of a generation.One gets the impression the old dandy got his insights about fashion and vernacular from hanging around inside an Abercrombie & Fitch store for half an hour. Over and over again we learn, as if these were some penetrating insights into campus zeitgeist, that undergraduate girls dress like sluts and undergraduate boys favor uncreased khakis and don't part their hair. Once he's told us these things by the third or fourth time, we realize that that's about the depth at which he's managed to penetrate this scene.Note to Wolfe: today's college kids do not punctuate their thoughts with words like ""Bango!"""
3,At least 200 pages too long,"I enjoyed the book, up until a point. I feel it was an accurate portrayal of life at a large private university, and interesting to read as a somewhat recent college graduate. At the same time, I don't like how some things wrapped up so easily (won't give anything away, but this seemed to happen closer to the end of the novel).If you want to read about college life and its social hierarchy, definitely check it out. If you are looking for something ground breaking, try something else."
3,Intereting story; annoying narrative,"I'm only on disc four out of 25 discs right now. So far the story is interesting, but I don't know that I will finish listening to the rest of the book because of the reader. When Mr. Baker is simply reading the narrative, he does an adequate job although some of his inflections seem to miss the target. Mr. Baker actually does a fine performance of Charlotte, Charlotte's mother, and most of the other characters from Charlotte's hometown of Sparta, NC.However, his characterization of young males is both stereotypical and unimaginative. Ergo annoying. Not all college-aged males sound like Spicoli."
2,Predictable characters and obvious conclusions,"Tom Wolfe's mastery of the language makes him a great storyteller. But don't expect anything from this overly long book than one-dimensional characterizations and predictable plot resolutions. You've met every character many times before. There's the snooty, self-absorbed rich girls; the hormone-charged dumb jocks; the angry, middle-aged Jewish professor; the angry feminist; envious, cruel girlfriends ... etc., etc., etc. You can easily predict what will happen and how the subplots will play out. The only intriguing person is Charlotte herself. Yet Wolfe betrays and trivializes his title star. In the end, her final actions seem out-of-character and, for the reader especially, totally unrewarding."
2,A very weak effort...,"Tom Wolfe has written some terrific books over the years, but this isn't one of them. The characters are mostly wooden and shallow. The ""shocking"" material is cliche. It's as if he cobbled together this novel from a bunch of 10-minute interviews with hungover trust fund brats. In between the parties and basketball games, most college students I know are struggling to pay the bills and find some career path that will allow them to rise above a job at Wal-Mart. Charlotte Simmons herself is little more than a paste-up figure trying to illustrate a cautionary story about ""the smart working-class country girl who gets swept away by the sinful, dishonest elite on a big name (imaginary) campus."" In my experience, the working class rural kids are a hell of a lot more savvy about the realities of life than most of the ""daddy bought me a new Beemer when I turned 16"" set. Dull, predictable stuff. Try again, Tom."
2,Disappointing,"I found the book to be unbelievable in its many stereotypes. I was a lot like Charlotte (valedictorian of my senior class, and even a Church of Christ attender as she was!) when I went to college. I saw a lot of immature behavior, but even back in the dark ages of the '80s, I wasn't shocked or surprised by it. My roommate pledged Chi Omega, and she was never around, either. Surprise! Even though I attended a party school (University of Texas at Austin), I found LOTS of students who were serious about school, and enjoyed college without making fools of themselves. I recall being in only one class with a football player, and that was electrical engineering! So much for the ""dumb jock"" stereotype. As I read the book, I kept thinking that the subject had a lot of potential, but Mr. Wolfe failed to develop it."
2,very disappointed!,"i bought this book because i have heard all the hype about it and figured it ought to be pretty good. normally i'm not a picky reader, as i usually pick up a book one day and finish it the very next! but this one was so hard to get into! first of all, it was WAAAAAAAY too wordy! half the time he'd spend time explaining these very minor characters that really only appeared once in the story! i kept bypassing those long, drawn out descriptions! and i NEVER just skim paragraphs or sections, but i knew i wouldn't miss anything important. then there was just NO climax at the end of the story! it just sort of...ended. VERY disappointed and i do not recommend wasting your money on it!"
3,on the fence,"I am very torn about this book. I feel like the story was good, and in the beginning I liked Charlotte and the story. However, it took some unrealistic turns and was soooo wordy that the book was almost painful to get through. I skimmed a lot of it. If I did not have a compulsive need to finish every book I start I would have put it down. The book could have been 400 pages long and told the same story in a much better way. A frustrating read."
3,A great book with crappy ending,"First off, I am a college student, and as unfortunate as this may ring with those reviewers from slightly older generations, his depiction of college life is not inaccurate in the slightest. In fact, his depiction of ""student-athletes"", frat-guys, sorority girls, and intellectuals is dead-on.Yes, he does fail to portray the broader social strata of college life. And yes, he does portray the extreme in social situations as more commonplace than they are in actuality. But the book is very well written, captivating, and quite funny. You really get to know the characters, and if you're a college student, they will most likely remind you of someone you know in reality.My only complaint is his ending. I found it to be rushed, somewhat unbelievable, and poorly planned. It left me a bit stunned, and disappointed. Maybe he planned it that, I'm not sure. Overall, it's worth the read, though I'd recommend buying it used."
3,Solid,"Many readers balk at Wolfe's description of college life as though Wolfe has taken some tone of moral indignation at what he saw at the top colleges he researched.Were this the case, it would be fine to note that Wolfe is ""too old"" and doesn't understand youth enough. But such a tone is never reached, and I must ask why Wolfe is considered ""too old"" for having wanted to do a study on college culture and succeeding.Remember that Wolfe is primarily a journalist. For him to have immersed himself in the ""cool crowds"" of America's elite is no small feat. The understanding he reaches and clever commentary (I'm thinking specifically of ""F*** and S*** Patois""), written in his usual style with brilliant dialogue and description, make this a completely worthy effort on his part."
3,A bit too long....,"I would have enjoyed the book more if it wasn't so long! I think about 80% of the book was filled with unnecessary details. I also found the way Charlotte or her parents would pronounce words written in italics after each sentence distracting. I have heard a Southern accent and don't need reminding about the way one sounds. I also thought Charlotte was a cold hearted girl with a much too big ego. I can understand wanting to fit in but anyone who turns their backs on friends to hang out with the ""cool people"" is just plain cold hearted. Plus I didn't like the way she strung Adam along and only talked to him when she needed something. She used Adam the same way Thorpe used her. No one is as naive as the author portrays her, like someone said in another review wasn't she supposed to be smart and well read?"
2,did not like this book!!,"The only other Wolfe I have read is the Right Stuff, and it was excellent. But this book drove me crazy!! I read the first third and then skipped to the last third of the book, just hoping even one of the characters would develop some redeeming qualities. I was disappointed when none of the characters were even likable (I don't expect saintliness in my characters, I love flawed characters, but characters still have to be LIKABLE). I graduated from a small, Midwest state school 8 years ago, and although there was plenty of sex, alcohol, etc., there were other things too- learning, friendship building, etc. Some parts of the novel rang true, but overall, I was disappointed."
2,Bored with great writing,"Tom Wolfe is an effective writer with a great knowledge of the English language. In fact, it's so great, I not only had to carry this 2"" thick book around, but also had to carry my 2"" thick dictionary. The learning experience would have been worth it had the book had anything meaningful to say, but 700 pages of college kids using bad language and screwing each other is pretty academic and sophomoric (excuse the puns) to the overall scheme of things.Having grown up in the NC mountains (Boone) about 20 miles from Charlotte Simmons homesite, there were some poignant chapters and Wolfes geography is correct. Other than that, this story is not up to his previous ones and his wit was not as sharp. Lots more enjoyable books out right now (Grisham, Buffett, Griffin)."
2,My Name is Charlotte Simmons,"This book is tedious at best. It was apparently not edited by either the author or his editor. It might have been interesting if it had been edited IN HALF. As it is, it deteriorates to redundant dribble. How could any respectable publishing house allow such self indulgent ranting go on and on and on.I'd recommend anyone interested wait for a very well abridged audiobook to come out."
2,"Interesting characters, but, story gets tedious","Wolfe captures the college environment well and develops the characters of this novel very well, but, the story seems to go on forever. The novel starts well -- several stories being weaved together -- some interesting characters, including the only white kid starting on the basketball team at this Duke/Stanford-like University. But, it becomes a tedious soap opera -- and over time I didn't care what happened to Charlotte or any of the other characters. I finished the book, but, could have easily put it away about 300 pages in."
3,Tom Wolfe MUST be read,"Don't let the three star rating fool you. This is a must read book...it's just not a GREAT book nor is it as powerful a piece of social criticism as ""Bonfire"" or as well told a story as ""Man in Full"". That said, it's still damn good.I find Wolfe amazing in his capacity to capture the significance and irony of nearly any situation. But how a 70 year old man can portray, accurately as far as I can tell, the culture and feeling of a college campus is a feat beyond reckoning. Even though the generation of college students in ""Charlotte Simmons"" is a generation removed from mine, I recognized their (only) slightly less decadent counterparts in my own college experiences.I suppose the weakness here, when compared to his previous novels, revolves around the main characters. They just don't seem as fully fleshed out. Perhaps that is as it should be since none of us is nearly as interesting at 18 as we are at 30, 40, 50 and onwards."
2,Re-press that white suit...,"Tom Wolfe was hip back in the day. Well, this isn't that day. You get more insight into college angst by watching an episode or two of Dawson's Creek reruns then by this drivel written by someone completely out of his element. He can definitely turn a phrase now and then, but my recommendation is to pass on this one."
1,"Verbose, predictable and a struggle to get through","The subject of the book will never go out of style and will forever be a hot issue amoung both students and teachers. The core issues have been the same since college education came into being. The presentation style is what I have trouble digesting - way too verbose and repetitious. Sometimes it seems that Mr. Wolfe forgot that he had said the same thing before, be it informing of a character's feelings or when describing a situation. Frankly, often I felt like skipping the pages here and there only to stumble upon a repeat of something else. This 'I may have told you but here I am saying it yet again' obscures a relevant topic. It is very clear that Mr. Wolfe does not believe that brevity to tbe the key to a good story. This is not a book that had me interested as many characters are predictable, presented in black and white, thus making getting to the last page a great relief."
3,A mile too Far,"Book is repetitious, relentlessly so, assuming one must be hit over the head repeatedly to ""get"" a point. Book is about 300 pages too long."
2,A Disappointing Waste of Time,"I bought I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS because I am such a fan of author Tom Wolfe. After completing the novel, I cannot help pondering what the point of the book may be.Certainly, Wolfe is a skilled writer, and his skills are obvious even in I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS. His ear for voices and dialect shows through, and his complicated subplot structure is here too, if not as complicated as in his earlier works.Still, I keep wondering what propelled Wolfe to tell this particular tale--in which the story begins with a detailed description of bowel movements.Other than the title character, those who populate this novel are uniformly unlikeable. So what if Wolfe gets teenspeak or athletespeak or even blackspeak?All of Wolfe's skills merge together to form this unpleasant and uninteresting novel. What a waste of talent! I will not be buying his future books."
4,I am Tom Wolfe,"I love Tom Wolfe, I've read everything he's ever written (almost) I don't think the point here was jounalistic accuracy, but another venue for his razor sharp social commentary and satirical wit. This book doesn't get 5 stars because, despite the entertainment value, it did slog down in parts, really getting verbose and long winded. Case in point, the chapter on Charlotte's long sad visit home during Christmas and what Momma would think. I suppose Tom Wolfe is at the stage of his career where he can tell editors to take a flying leap, and I guess this is what happened here. Still, he made me laugh and made me get angry, which is what he's so good at."
2,lighten up,"Am I missing something? The reviews are full of sound and fury, told by so many, for a book signifying very little."
2,I couldn't make it past page 85....,"For the record, I have read every single Tom Wolfe book ever written. I, of course, had high hopes for this one. I have only been out of college for 5 years, but I couldn't STAND to read this horribly cliched novel. I feel sorry for the parents that read this and think that their new college kid will have to go through what Charlotte does. It just isn't represented accurately. His writing style is so outstanding, it makes me wonder why he chose to write about something he knew nothing about. I just couldn't take it...sorry Tom. I'll be back for your next one."
2,Missed the edge it could have had. . .unfortunately,"This book could have found an edge, peering into the college youth and their habits, twists and early, media aged wisdom. Instead, it borders on a thirty year too late ideal of what college would have been like, had it been cut up and played out on the movie screen for exactly 90 minutes; no variation of the actual youth of today. Want edge? Read Bukowski."
1,Disappointing,"I haven't read Wolfe in years (Kool Aid Test, Bonfire of the Vanities) and looked forward to his new one. What a shocking disappointment! The story is shallow, the characters are passe, and only occasionally does Wolfe come up with a meaningful sentence. Mr. Wolfe should stick to wearing his white suits on the talk show circuit and be satisified with impressing the likes of Katie Couric and others with double digit IQs. He has indeed outlived his reputation and talent.Dr. Dean"
3,Not the Breakfast Club,"The stereotypes in IACS verged on those in The Breakfast Club, but without the depth and pathos, and so, less satisfying in the end."
2,Comic without meaning to be!,"Tom Wolfe has always been a bit over the top, but at his best with his peculiar brand of non-fiction. His two previous novels (Bonfires of the Vanities & A Man in Full) were pretty boring, something that is hard to do when the writing is so good. With ""I am Charlotte Simmons"" he seems completely out of it, so much so that the writing is pale, dull and foppish and the dialogue is laughable in its triteness. Either TW has lost his talent, phoned it in or is trying a new style that fails miserably. It appears as though his research, which was said to be extensive, was ignored or poorly done. He is out of touch with today's college scene, and so much so that if he had placed it in the sixties it might have done better as a spoof. My advice to TW is give up fiction and try another ""Electric Kool Aid Acid Test"" so we can see if the talent is still there or gone forever."
1,I Gave Myself Permission to Stop Reading It,I always finish books I start.Until now. I realized that Tom Wolfe was taking 3 pages to describe what a paragraph could have.And then I realized that there wasn't a single character I cared about.So I put it downAnd I've never felt so good about it.
1,A disappointment,"Because I'm as susceptible to ""hype"" as the next person, and because I did enjoy ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""A Man in Full"" despite their flaws, I looked forward to reading ""Charlotte Simmons"". But there is a basic flaw in the premise of this book: Charlotte is a brilliant girl, a star of her high school, read deeply in many areas, but hadn't actually prepared for college, it that she hadn't read a bit about how prevalent drugs, alcohol and sexual activity are in colleges today. The book is therefore without surprises except that such a smart, supposedly strong woman would only judge herself by how she is rated in the eyes of men."
3,Is Charlotte Pathologically Antisocial?,"I'm almost done with the book, but I just can't get over Wolfe's description of Charlotte's ""sexile"". When Beverley suggests that Charlotte crash on the floor of a neighbor's room, Charlotte claims that she doesn't know anybody.One month into freshman year at a private university, and she doesn't know anybody? I went to a similar school 17 years ago, and our co-ed floor did just about everything (eat, talk, party, etc) together. It was practically mandatory! I've asked friends of mine who went to similar schools, and they had the same experience as freshmen.For Charlotte to not know any of her neighbors after a month on a typical freshman floor would suggest that this is a woman who is very disturbed and in serious need of therapy. I don't think this was the image Wolfe meant to convey, but that's how it comes across to me."
3,The dog loves her water dish but the wing nuts slip,"the design and main product are great but they really skimped on the stamped steel wing nuts. You will need to go to the hardware store and buy replacement nuts or have a wet dog. Still the dish and mount work great, the dog does not have to worry about kicking over her dish in her sleep because the dish is off the floor. Even the crazy cat runs into the dog crate to drink from the high mounted water dish rather than drink from her dish on the floor."
3,not as good as others in the series,"I have read and enjoyed all of the other books in the series and found this one to be disappointing in comparison. The plot of the boys going to war and the family coping at home is thin, repetitive and drags on. The books seems to be weighted down by everyone doubting their faith. It also contains more of George Hammond not coping and behaving badly, just as he did after his wife's death. The most interesting part is the character development of Franky and Sarah and their relationship."
4,Very good book,"I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. This is the last of the series. For some reason, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others but it was still a very good book and I would recommend it."
5,My grandchildren love this book!,"The 1,2,3 Bees is a fun book to read due to rhyme and adorable illustrations. My three small grandsons like to read the book over and over. They enjoy counting the bees with me and talking about the silly things that the bees are doing in the many different and entertaining illustrations. Contrary to other books we have read, this book is clean looking, colorful, and easy plus fun to read."
5,Baby Pro: Let's Make a Splash: Swimming - Surfing-Diving Sports,I highly recommend the item. I am an adult who is learning to swim and seeing the little kids do it encouraged me. I still use it.
3,If you like B Real then you will like this.,"I bought this album not knowing it was a mixtape(meaning he flows over other artists beats), but it is still pretty dope."
3,"good introduction, but..........","I have been fascinated by the Colle Zukertort system. When Black plays usual moves of ....d5, .....e6 the attack is very promising. This video mostly gives the viewer an appreciation of how the attack works. Beyond that, however, I was hoping to get more insight into what moves to make when Black plays other openings. I was disappointed in that regard. Reading other books is invaluable before becoming comfortable with the C-Z. I particularly recommend Rudel's books. I wish the DVD had at least touched on some of these other responses by Black, rather than continuing to analyse many games with the same theme."
4,"Nice light, but rendered obsolete by HID headlights","I used this briefly on my touring motorcycle for long, open stretches of road where the likelihood of animal encounters was high. A HID headlight conversion made the driving light unnecessary, however, and it's presently doing duty on a trailer as spot illumination for disabled vehicles being serviced roadside. It's tough, somewhere between a pencil beam and regular driving light, and easy to mount. Because of higher current demand of incandescent lights for the same amount of illumination (as compared to HID), I've converted most of my vehicles, but for a compact, inexpensive and rugged solution to medium-distance (40-200 feet) lighting needs where current requirements are not so critical (motorcycles don't have very ""robust"" electrical systems), I would certainly recommend this lamp."
5,A call to action,"This movie together with GHOSTS OF RWANDA ,a PBS documentary have made it clear towhat really happened in Rwanda.We shouldalways remind ourselves that these thingsreally happened and that they should neveragain happen.Rwanda sould be at the backof everybody's mind, these two movies willhelp you remember"
4,my 2 cents,"This movie is very powerful and very sad. As a youg person, I feel this conflict is one of the many that our parents either don't know much about, or don't like to talk about."
5,Riveting and absorbing,"I could not take my eyes off this film. It puts a very human face on the tragedy of Rwanda that was just another story buried in the newspapers in 1994. The movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" is excellent too, but this film really gives you blow-by-blow details and makes you feel as if you are there, living every moment. It is heartbreaking but a story that everyone should see and understand. What an important film this is."
4,"Emotional, gut-wrenching, depressing","I saw this film last night on my local public television station, followed by a panel discussion about genocide, led by CNN's Jeff Greenfield. The impact of the film is five stars, but I gave it four stars because I had difficulty at times understanding the English spoken by the actors, and it was difficult to know what was happening in certain scenes. However, that doesn't prevent you from understanding the major events of the film -- the horrific killings of Tutsis and Hutu sympathizers by Hutu rebels.I'm glad that we get to watch films like this, Hotel Rwanda, and Schindler's List, to understand what happened during the genocides of our recent past. The sad part is that I feel so helpless watching, knowing that the tragedies are over and that so many people in the world ignored what was happening. I hope that we are much more active in stopping these tragedies when they occur in the future."
4,Slow moving but effective,"As I have read many books and watched other films and documentaries on the subject, this particular film is easy to watch, albeit somewhat slow at times.A mixture of factual information and fictional characters, so it is almost an intermediary between a movie and a documentary."
1,The Left CANNOT do history........especially involving genocide,"SOMETIMES IN APRIL(2005) Directed, Produced and written by Raoul Peck.Starring Debra Winger.A generally bad four hour film about the Genocide in Rwandawhose main flaw can be identified in that Peck once made a biofilmpraising communist dictator Patrice Lumumba so obviously his take ongenocide is and must be.......ah........shaded.An obstructive smoke screen, the viewer will still, after this 4 hour film is done, not knowjust why the genocide happened nor will be able to name itsarchitects--its Himmlers, its Heydrichs, its Eichmans(whom one mustassume would be Black Africans). Somehow, according to Peck, it is allBelgium's fault and all the rest of those honkies. Even in genocide,Africans are still considered by the Left to be little Black Sambosincapable of anything without The Man to show him how.Stay with HOTEL RWANDA for the better film."
3,I was hoping for more,"This movie was about the geoncide in Rwanda in 1994. It follows the story a hutu soldier married to a tutsi woman. It flashes from past to present quite a bit and it can be confusing at times. The story is a bit long winded for my tastes and I actually found myself becoming bored at times. I much prefer Hotel Rwanda or the National Geographic documentary. Both of those were riveting IMO and this just lacked something. Nevertheless, it is still a decent movie worth watching at least once. Some people really liked it, so maybe I am just being overly critical of the film right now."
3,Great for the old days.,"This was real cutting edge when it came out. It is still fun, but a bit hard to go back to DOS. If you are a die-hard vintage gamer. This one is for you. Rank it with hexen and heretic for bringing back the old technology."
2,Too many talking heads!,"I had high hopes for this documentary, but it is pretty disappointing. There are very short clips from various concerts and appearances but they are always interrupted by some vapid comment so that you can't hear the song or see the performance. Many times you will have the full screen performance going on without sound--just someone talking about how great he thought it was. Let us hear it! We can tell how great it is. It was apparently done as a television show because there are breaks where you have a little teaser, then the screen goes dark, and they come back repeating what they just said. If you don't know anything about Bette Midler and want to hear some background information, I guess you might like to sit through it once. If you are like me, though, and have seen every one of her concerts since ""Clams on the Half-Shell"" and are hoping to relive some of those moments, forget it. You will be very disappointed."
1,"Way, way too much commentary!","Much too much discussion and far too little singing. Only two songs were actually performed: ""From a Distance"" and ""Do You Want to Dance?"" I'm very disappointed and can NOT understand the high ratings given by other reviewers.""Bette Midler in Concert: Diva Las Vegas"" DVD, currently available only in Region 2, needs to be made available in the USA!"
1,Recieving the Power,This book is full of too many random examples to carry a cohiesive meaningful message.
2,Addonai and I,This cd was strong instrumentally but very lacking talent-wise in the vocal department.
4,Colorful Pop-up Book About Ziggy the Zebra's Stripes,"This book is a great joy for children, adults and teachers. It is the story about Ziggy trying to find his stripes. He goes to his friends in the area, who are pop-out characters found on each page. The friends are colorful and great ways to learn animals and what they look like. Does Ziggy find his stripes? Do his friends join him in the search?"
3,not what i asked for,"I'm upset. I ordered this 20-piece dinnerware set and received a 5-piece completer set instead. Now, there is not another set in stock. I hope that this can be rectified."
1,A complete waste,"I don't even know why they're still selling this book. I can't even sell it used. It's far to wordy, as though I didn't have anything better to do than listen to some ramble on about their religious beliefs."
2,Eh... Wouldn't buy again,"Didn't fit on the light switch quite right, and the screw doesn't line up.Kind of disappointed, b/c it wasn't exactly cheap :\"
3,Too slow,this movie got off to a slow start and never did get up to speed. Did not reallyenjoy this movie that much....
2,"Coffee cups, promises, sure","There's an episode of Seinfeld where Jerry asks George to throw out Jerry's garbage. George says he won't touch the garbage for any less than two dollars. Jerry sets the bag next to Kramer's door, knocks, and leaves. Kramer answers the door and happily takes the bag inside. That's kind of how I felt after after watching Sleeping Beauty, like Kramer, with Julia Leigh's garbage."
3,Odd but entertaining. Not for everyone though,"After reading the description of this film, I was expecting something very different. While the movie was entertaining and very well done, it was not what I was expecting and was therefore a bit of a letdown. The story progresses somewhat slowly with some almost unexplainable small incidents that seem very out of place (that or we just didn't get it). It is definitely a thinking film and so I would not assume the masses would be thrilled with it. Worth watching but really wish it wasn't quite as much for a rental."
1,Sleeping Beauty,This movie is one to pass on. It's so bad I don't know where to start. Any kind of erotic scenes you are expecting don't happen. The lead females acting is bad and the scenes are not erotic. The rest of the movie is boring and drags along with no purpose. I think a five year old kid wrote this movie in one day. I wish could get my money back.
5,amazing,"I have waited so long to see this, now that I have, it was worth the wait. Emily didn't dissapoint she delivered a great performance. Following her life for those moments. Bravo to you!"
1,Sleeping Beauty,"This movie just Stinks. The best thing about this movie, is the box it comes in. Not much more one can say!"
3,about the film sleeping beauty......,"The story basicallt talk about how the ongoing story of socisl escort offering themseleves to some old folks without sex attached. There are a few bed scenes in this film which the film was done in Lido theatre in Singapore, Orchard Road (something like New Yoek shopping places with high rise buildings).Written by:Ang Poon KahDirector David Yates - Ang Poon Kah for film harry potter and the dearthly hallows 1 and 2"
2,Don't bother....,"Somewhere I read how wonderful and erotic this movie was. I bought the unrated version which i read was the best. If this is the best someone has seen, all I can say is they need to get out more!I didn't actually fall asleep but came pretty darn close. Emily was nice to look at but I felt like i was watching an R rated movie on network tv. It seemed so spliced up, half of it didn't make sense. And the ending......now that was a real piece of work! The only reason i gave it two stars was that Emily was so nice to look at."
2,Emily is amazing but movie isn't.,"one word to describe this movie is bizarre, student takes a job as a prostitute but sex is off limits, she takes drugs and sleeping nude while older gentlemen do bizarre things to her. then she doesn't take the drugs and finds out what really happens when shes not sleeping. cringing momments and just a weird movie. emily browning does a good performance but deserves to use her talent in a better movie."
1,the move that went absolutely nowhere.,"gratuitous sexual content and that's about all this movie has to offer. worse than eyes wide shut, and i didn't think that was possible. just worthless watching if that's what you're into."
3,Good - not great,After watching the film I kept thinking about the Cruise Kidman Eyes Wide Shut film - I do not like to give plot summaries away - I really liked but did not think the film was fantastic - but it was intriguing. Dragged a tad. Actor/actresses - great - premise - great - denouement and the rest - i felt unfulfilled..............
3,Sleeping Beauty,"Being a award winning film at a major festival, I thought it would be more polished. The plot/story line had several holes....lots of subplots that didn't seem to fit....friend dies of aids....what that got to do with the story of a strange Madam? For a movie that is suppose to be super sexual....they is little sexuality in it....contradiction."
3,Strange Story and Strange Ending,"The first part of this movie started out well. It reminded me of the Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman movie, Eyes Wide Shut. I was thinking that the story would lead up to an exciting ending of some sort. But, the story didn't go anywhere and the last half of the movie was really strange."
2,Dissapointed,"No plot, no depth to caracters, obscure. Utterly lacking in engaging viewer. Kept expecting movie to take a turn, tie the loose ends, never happens."
1,A cure for insomnia!,"I have seen many ""art house"" movies in my life and am very open-minded about subject matter in films. I cannot figure out what happened in this film.The plot and dialog were scattered through out, but I held out hope for improvement. No such luck. Scenes were unclear with no explaination for any of the characters actions. What was that ending? I hope to see the actress in other films, and I hope the director SHOWS UP for the filming."
2,Deeply disturbing.,"Sleeping Beauty is one of those films that sound intriguing but just end up being a huge letdown. The writer/director of this film tries too hard to be the female version of Stanley Kubrick. She uses a lot of his style like long, drawn-out takes and barely any thought-provoking dialogue. I just couldn't believe how deeply disturbing this film was and I'm usually a big fan of celebral/artsy movies but this one is so unsexy and completely pointless that I lost interest halfway through the film. The only reason I'm giving Sleeping Beauty 2 stars is because of the daring, fearless performance of Aussie star, Emily Browning. Browning is captivating to watch but even her talent isn't enough to make this film a winner for me! Such a disappointment."
2,??????,WTF. Is all I can say. The two stars are for being able to see Emily Browning all nude and naked almost the entire movie. But as for what the point of the movie????????? I don't even know what the movie was all about?
4,a well-done history,"Britain started out ahead, but partly for that reason her carrier forces (and especially planes) were less suited for combat than America's. This is an excellent study of how that came to pass. Sadly missing is an equally insightful look at the Japanese carrier fleet, which in the winter of 1941-42 was arguably the equal of America's."
3,Not Darnielle's best,"I have heard just about every song that John Darnielle has ever produced, and although I'd take John Darnielle's early work any day over his last few CDs, I still looked forward to hearing this EP. After listening to it about ten times, I'm still not quite sure what I think. Like many of Darnielle's songs, the songs grow on you, and you really start to love them after you know them forward and backward. ""Ox Baker Triumphant"" caught my attention right away, and it could be a great song, but the guitar work sounds incredibly similar to ""This Year."" Less is more for Darnielle. This CD, like The Sunset Tree, is simply too polished. The lyrics on all the songs are solid (much better than ""The Sunset Tree,"" in my opinion), but the best parts of his muisc--the cracks in his voice and raw emotion and intensity that you can find in his earlier work--are missing. Darnielle is at his best when it's just him, his guitar, and his tape recorder."
3,Consistent With The Other Books,"I could be wrong, but if this author did not invent the dark, disgruntled, close to disrespectful spy novel then would did? This is another in the series and is not bad. What I like with these books is you always know what you are going to get, nothing new to slow you down. I can handle that lack of creativity because the author does such a good job at telling a story. The story, spy vs. spy in Europe, is not a new one and you will not find anything really new or memorable here. Overall the book is average and if you like the category or the author you will like the book."
2,Not Deep Purple!,"""Dreamcatcher"" isn't anything like Deep Purple... Of course that is not the reason this album isn't that good. The reason is that the songs just don't work, except ""That's why God is singing the blues""."
2,Sorry this is not one of Ian's best,"Ian Gillan has made a number of fine records over the years, but this is not one of them. The production is terrible and all the songs have the same sterile sound. Sound problems aside, most of the songs just aren't that good. I have been really disappointed with this one.Nevertheless, there are still a few keepers. ""Country Mile"" is really nice. ""Chandra's Coriander"" is interesting. ""That's Why God is Singing the Blues"" is typically enjoyable Gillan humor/philosophy, and the cover of ""Any Way You Want Me"" is quite entertaining.Also, be warned that this is not one of Gillan's hard rock albums. It's not exactly soft either, but the sound is far removed from the heavy metal of a record like ""Glory Road""."
4,The best rock vocalist ever??,"Maybe yes! Mr. Ian Gillan: a real master of vocals!! All his work, in Deep Purple or solo, are great, each of them has its own magic. Maybe that's why Ritchie Blackmore was always so envy of him...Born in 1945, Gillan continues to deliver strong music even today. he can abrange a lot of musical styles without selling out. He can flert with different sounds without making lousy music. He's a great composer, simply as that. One of the best EVER.Now, let's talk about DREAMCATCHER. It's a melodic, envolving, beautiful album. Alright, it's definitely not about hard rock, pure and simple. It has some new textures, some new idead, some hand-picked covers. It has it all!!! The production is not so great, I don't even know who played bass, keyboards and drums here. But the album can be listened from the first to the last track with a smile on your lips! A gem!!"
2,CAn't hardly recognize Gillan here...,"I couldn't hardly recognize Gillan here. The album is weak, poppish, something really weird."
2,Past his prime?,"I thought that with Gillan, how can I miss? This is one of the worst Gillan cd's I have ever heard, not an interesting memorable track on the entire cd. Gillan fans be warned."
1,Unhappy,Very unhappy with the hat I received. There is a black smear above the logos. Tag is torn off. And it is soiled.Was supposed to be a surprise gift for my husband who loves the Eagles. Must return it. Really wanted that hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,the Broken Circle,"The book has been interesting since its inception.The author conjured it from a mass of interviews during a summer some years later. Granted, the book is haunting, tragic and disturbing. The text, failed to understand the horror and confusion of the Anglos. I am well aware of this. Ronny Haynie, 3601 Sunset Ave. 1974....Farmington, New Mexico"
1,Zero Stars,"Neither movie plays, it goes to 10 seconds and just stops on both sides. I have never seen such a poorly made disc double side in my life. I have had this too long to return it but if you have the same trouble, do not just return the disc, demand your money back. This is a stupid parlor trick to get two movies on a disc and the disc will not play, period. Could it be my player? Well, no other disc I have ever used has done this on any system.What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this ""product?"" That it played, period. I think having this horrible excuse for a DVD back to back twosome is hilarious and a farce. How am I doing on the detailed good review demands given to us by this darned fine firm which does not sell anything of quality."
5,Abominable and More Abominable,"The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again are two great classics from that early-70's British Nicholson/Arkoff film group. Aside from being fairly cheesy, these two do a good job of not taking themselves too seriously and they are strewn with that dry Brit humour that was so popular at that time. Reasonably well done, these films are not bad enough to make it to MST-3K -- and of course Vincent Price is delicious as he hams it up just enough to let the audience know that his tongue is firmly lodged in his cheek. The production values are good and the video transfer is what you'd expect for an older film. Be nice if it were in stereo, but I just can't imagine anyone forking over the cash to restore the film and rework the soundtrack. These are good films to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon!"
3,"An ""OK"" flim","Not one of Prices best movies, however, truly insane thats for sure. Price is such a great actor and it would be hard to say anything about the film..however, both films are truly strange."
1,Cheesy,"I saw this film when I was seven years old. And it scared me. But, as an adult, I think the movie is cheesy and creepy. Since it is from the 1970s, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. If you like cheesy Vincent Price movies, this might be for you."
5,Creepy,this movie is pretty good. the story is kinda lame but vincent price makes the movies worth watching and buying. these movies are great if it wasn't for vincent price then these movies would suck. if you have not seen these movies then i recommend you do
3,Picky on players,"Took too long to discover that this disk also plays only the brief intro. Tried three different players so far. All the same problem. A dud but waited too long to find the problem.Further news:It plays well, but only on certain players. The first three players were unable to get past the first intro. Only a dumb portable player reads both sides fine. So the disk has some weird copy protection scheme."
5,"Smokin""",Great deal on a pair of Classic Ficks! Vincent Price was ahead of the times in this film! Revenge with a touch of Class!
4,"Obvious? Maybe, but Smith wasn't being subtle.","This is largely a review of the other reviews on this page. They complain that Smith's novel, ""Reprisal"" wasn't a mystery. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a mystery. It had poetry in it. Oh, my goodness! Imagine, someone forcing you to read a poem! Unconstitutional, certainly.This book is about an extraordinarily disturbed human being. The fact that her identity isn't a mystery is irrelevant. What she does, and what is done to her in reprisal, is the subject matter of this excellent novel. I recommend it."
1,No Terror - just Terrible,This is the worst book that I attempted to read in about two years. The author is very wordy in telling the story. The characters in the books were not set up well at all and therefore I could not connect with them. I read word for word only 41 pages of this book and skimmed about three places in the book and felt secure that I knew everything that happened. This is the first book that I have tried of Mitchell Smith and will not try another. There are too many good authors out there to waste my time here. I suggest that you don't waste yours.
1,Don't bother with this one,"I bought this Weber unit hoping for Weber quality. What I got was the same junk that most of the other reviewers here got. The probe fried on the first use, even though I took special care to keep it away from too much heat - but my efforts were in vain. How about that, a BBQ thermometer that can't take the heat of a BBQ.I'm still looking for a good BBQ thermometer."
1,WO(RST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BOUGHT,"Weber should be ashamed of themselves for selling this trash. Mine worked ONCE, then same as everyone else. Flashing 199 degrees on display, and constant beeping. The customer ""service"" person I had the mis-fortune to speak to REFUSED to do anything about it unless I could prove that it was less than a year old. Who keeps receipts for a 30 dollar product? Judging from all the complaints listed here, Weber has got to know what garbage this is, and yet they don't seem to care about doing the right thing and taking one's word for it. I will NEVER own a Weber product again if they are that unconcerned about their customers! STAY AWAY FROM THIS JUNK!!!!"
3,You can get replacement probes - but why should you have to?,"I used mine once, and it fried. If you call Weber's absolutely fantastic helpline (really, it is great), they will ship you a new one. The company is good, this product is a victim of the type of thermocouple they chose to use. The Weber help line says the new ones are beefier, but I suspect that they marketed this product without verifying that it can be used in an actual grill. What were they thinking? A grill thermometer that cannot stand the heat of a grill? Stupid. I love my Genesis grill, but the probe is simply inferior. Still, after 1 week, my replacement probe is still working, so there is hope :)"
1,Cheap construction,I used this product 3 times before it broke. Very cheaply made. Can't find replacement parts. I recommend going with a higher quality product. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,does not last!,I loved this thermometer when I first got it. It lasted a few months and then went crazy giving absurd readings. The first Weber product that is just garbage. Don't buy it!
1,gale,This is our second Weber thermometer which has not worked. We have not been able to get either one to synch. I contacted the manufacturer to see if we were doing something wrong and did not receive a response. Based on previous reviews synching is a problem. This is supposed to be a good thermometer but I would not know.
1,Thermometer,"Piece of junk. Works okay initially, then find out that it continues to drain batteries even after being shut off. Batteries need to be removed after each use. Lasted one grilling season. Would not recommend."
1,Worthless Junk,"Too bad I did not see the reviews before I bought this in a hardware store. This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon, due to my overwhelming disgust with this product. It worked for exactly 6 uses before failing in exactly in the way described in these posts; suddenly reading 199 and above when the meat was nowhere near this temperature. What a POS."
4,digital thermometer,"It works very good, but would be better if you could set the temperature you want, instead of preset temperatures. Good product."
2,"Good idea, poor execution.","I received this as a gift after I bought a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker. It worked great the first two times I used it, then the probe failed open (high resistance). Accuracy was a little questionable which could be an issue, especially for smoking at a low temp. I work with delicate instumentation and electronics on a daily basis, and I handled this one ""with kid gloves""....never closed a lid on it, bent it, twisted it, dropped it, spindled it, or anything. My personal opinion is that the probe/wire portion of this device is too thin and flimsy for its purpose (or any purpose). All of my other Weber accessories are outstanding (Rib Racks, Roast Rack, Smoker itself, brush, Chimney, etc) but they really dropped the ball on this one.The bottom line is that the wireless thermometer is a great idea.....but pay a little more and get one that will last. In the meantime, I hope Weber releases an upgraded version if they haven't already."
1,Worked great until it broke!,This was the best thermometer I ever used -- until it broke. I dropped the transmitter about 2 feet and that was it. Now it's dead and I only got about 10 uses out of it.
2,Mine Quit Working!,I love this thing! But after using it about 15 times it stopped working. Don't know if it was dropped or not. Tried changing batteries. Tried reseting everything.
2,A real lemon.,"Used it 4 times and it worked great. The fifth and last time I tried it, (it's now going into the trash can.)it gave such a false reading that I screw up my nice lamb shoulder. Best to use the old fashioned instant thermometer - at least it's accurate. So there you are - $39 for a usless thermometer and $11 for a ruined lamb shoulder."
2,"Not really ""Weber Style""","The quality is not up to Weber Standards. The nominal temperatures for various degrees of ""wellness"" do not agree with the temperatures published in Weber's cookbooks and they're NOT adjustable. Further, the product needed replacement twice in the first sixty days of ownership. The only good thing about this item is Weber's service & support personnel. They're absolutely excellent."
2,"Good Idea, needs work","My experience with this product reads like hundreds I have read for all the timers out there. Used it once or twice on the grill, cleaned it so thoroughly that I broke the sensor by dipping it in water. They need to put a manual inside that include all the exception behaviors to be avoided."
2,Not Durable,"Owned this for around four months and used it about eight times before it broke. The probe reads 199 and it beeps all the time. I can plug in one of my probes from a different manufacturer and it works, but the plug is not exactly the same and won't stay in place. Thus I have a $42 pile of junk."
1,Beware the limitation!!!,"I returned mine. Why? Because it does not give you a reading for anything over 199 degrees. I purchased mine for use in a Weber smoker. I wanted to measure temperatures up to 220 degrees inside the smoker. This timer only registers to 199 degrees. After that it just beeps to tell you (as the directions say:) ""out of range"". It worked fine below that, but it was useless with any temps over that. It says the probe can register up to 480 degrees or something, so why limit the readout?"
1,Two problems,"First - the probe itself was defective - a short circuit or open circuit. It would not show a temperature. I had a similar probe from a Williams-Sonoma oven thermometer that worked fine with the Weber, so I know it was the Weber probe that was defective.Second, and more important - you cannot program the temperatures for the different foods (beef, chicken, etc.). The pre-programmed ""FDA recommended"" temperatures are all too high - they produce dried meat. My Williams-Sonoma thermometer allows you to change the temperatures to your own liking - so you can produce a rare steak.I bought the Weber because it is designed for grilling, not just ovens, but these flaws caused me to send it back."
3,Very Good for one season,"I have owned a few wireless thermometers and use them in smokers. The accuracy of this one is good for about one year. I have been unable to find replacement probes. So, if you plan to replace it each season it is a good buy. I was expecing a longer life."
1,Same (bad) experience as others,"I've never posted before, but thought I should add my .02. My unit worked once --- and never again. Tried the new battery thing as well, to no avail. Grrrr. Very annoying to read that SO many others had similar problems --- and yet the product is still being sold."
4,Working fine so far and does what it claims,So far I am very pleased with this product. I have read the negative reviews about it failing eventually but so far I have used it numerous times in a Big Green Egg for chicken and lamb roasts at grill temps around 350F with no problems. The remote functions well at a good distance and through an outside wall. I agree that the factory set doneness temps (that are unchangeable)are not ideal (as with most other digital meat thermometers). CONS: No timer built in and no way to set up a user defined temp alarm but I guess for under $30 what do you expect. Also will not tell you grill/oven temperature because max temp reading is only 199F.Look into the Maverick Et-73 for a remote dual temp (meat and grill) thermometer - but almost twice the price.
1,Advertised Price A Sham?,"This item is advertised on may different websites at $29.99, however when you try to buy it, Amazon suddenly jacks the price up to $34.99?"
1,a possible fix for all these?,"Looking on the web, there are many sources for high temperature wire, like for aerospace uses, so I suppose someone handy could rewire the probe without much difficulty. Of course, the special wire might cost more than the whole deal."
2,Difficult to synch remote probe and unit,"I bought two of these units. The instructions require you to reset the receiving unit in order to get it to synch with the sending unit. However, it does not seem to work. After many attempts and much frustration, I got it to work.The unit seems very accurate, and its great to have it remote. However, I have already ruined one of the two probes, as I inserted it into the meat immediately, while I was still searing. My grill temp must have been over the 480 degree limit, as the probe has now been damaged and does not work at all."
1,"Weber name, not Weber quality","Weber should be ashamed to have their name on this. No timer, the temperatures are already programmed (rare, med rare, well done), you can't adjust them. After the first hour it lost the signal and I could get it back, turned it on and off, nothing. Spend a few extra dollars and get the Redi-Check, it has a timer, you can set the temperature, and the remote sensor has a temperature read out. I own 2 Weber grills, and I only buy Weber accessories, but this one is junk!"
1,Complete garbage,"At first, I was thrilled. It worked great for one BBQ smoking session, then stopped working, then worked intermittently, then stopped again. Tried new batteries to no avail. I am very disappointed in Weber for putting their name on this piece of junk. Do not buy this under any circumstances."
2,great while it lasted,"This product was great for the first 3 months of use. It worked really well and we were very happy campers. Our friend bought one and his lasted through only 2 uses, ours died unexpectedly after s couple months usage."
1,Probe Failed,"The temp probe will fail after a few uses. The temp will read 199 F when it fails. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Worked great while it lasted,"Same problem as everyone else - temp probe fails with ""199"" degrees as soon as you turn them both on. Before it died, it worked great, but I'd recommend you get a quality instant read thermometer instead... this just isn't reliable enough to count on for the long run."
2,Great when it works,"I'm on my third one and am opting for a different brand now. The first one I bought worked fantastically for the first year or two. No issue - very easy to use, worked like a charm. One day the probe got soaked in water and stopped working. No warranty coverage and no way to buy a replacement for just that part. So, I bought a new one. That one broke within a couple of weeks. In a thanksgiving/turkey emergency, I bought a third one. Now that one is broken also. Overall, if you get lucky, this could work great for you, but if it breaks, you're pretty much out of luck."
1,Broke after 1 use,"Received this as a gift. Used once, it worked great. Now it tells me that my refrigerator is at 132 degrees. I suspect its the temperature probe. Cheaply made. Buyer beware!"
1,I thought it was great until ......,i bought this thermometer last summer and amazed myself and my friends. that is untill i burnted $100.00 worth of pork tenderloins because it stopped working. i called the place i bought it from and because i couldnt find the reciept would not take it back. i tried new batteries and still have a blank current temp reading. i have every weber access. made besides the handle lights which after the thermometer im not sure about buying.if weber (china) could redesign this product to actully keep working it would be a perfect access. for any griller. other than that you could probably take your friends advise what to do with it.
1,Don't buy this one,It works okay but you cannot set the temperature my probe failed Yet I was careful to shield it form heat and water. To make matters worse this was before the upcoming labor day cook. You have to call Weber for a replacement.Unfortunaltely it was back ordered. I was cheerfully told If I placed an order now I could get one after Sept 22. I replied I needed it for labor day. their answer was well if you do not order it now It may be delayed even more.This matters to me How? Get something else
4,"So Far, So Good-update","Have used now for about 2 months and consider it a good purchase. Found it useful with my new grill to establish cooking times. Easy to clean. Bought it at local mega store so I could return it easily if it failed.Reason only 4 star---does not have a timer-can't set your own temp, must choose one from menu (lowest setting 135, doesnt read higher than 199 degrees).-if cooking for over an hour or so it does seem the probe gets hot enough to heat the surrounding area, giving a higher than true reading.-probe is thick so it will cause juices to run if repositioned.*update- after 6 months of sparse use the probe died, webber sent another after some prodding. IMO not durable -- would now 2 give stars"
1,a piece of junk,"used this thermometer one time, ever since it automatically reads 199 degrees, do not buy"
1,Do NOT buy this item!,"This is made by ""Oregon Scientific"" with the Weber name attached. It failed for me within 2 months. Contacting the parent company for help was no use at all and they refused to replace the item. Don't waste your money on this particular item"
4,Handy Reference,This is a handy reference for Illinois gardeners with quite a bit of inside info - what will really grow here and what won't -and I often refer to it. The information on specific varieties could be a little more meaty but overall this is well worth the price. I bought a copy of the first edition of this book and it wasn't very good. If you did also you should give Fizzell a second chance - this revised edition is much better.
1,Plants that grow in Illinois vs. plants that are NATIVE to Illinois,"I have been looking for books that show pictures/give descriptions of plants that are native to Illinois instead of plants that are from Europe, Asia, etc that happen to survive here. This book is not a book about Illinois plants at all, rather it tells you what plants you can plant from other regions that can thrive here. For example, Barberry, which is native to Europe and Asia (two different species), is an invasive plant that has found its way to the forest preserves in Illinois and crowds out native plants. Barberry will create a thicket of thorny shrubs where other plants cannot survive.If this book did not claim to be about Illinois gardening, then it would not surprise me if it had non-natives, but since it is supposedly about Illinois gardening, I would expect them to list species that actually belong in Illinois."
5,A must for visitors to the Somme,"This book offers a previously undisclosed insight into one of the bloodiest yet least known battles of the Great War. A natural storyteller, Renshaw takes you from the hastily dug trenches of Death Valley, to the thick undergrowth of Mametz Wood, attack after attack until the Germans eventually concede their impenetrable position. A handy sized paperback, the last chapter of the book is full of suggested walks, all beautifully illustrated, that take in key positions and points of interest that determined `life or death... success or failure' back in 1916. There's also a cleverly devised driving tour that takes in more of the surrounding area. Don't read this book at home - cross the channel and read it under the shadow of the Welsh Memorial with the dark mass of Mametz Wood in front of you - I did!Superbly written - clearly explained."
2,Not very helpful,"I have my own business and hoped this book would help me organize my deductions.The book is not very informative, practically organized, or even minimally useful.I'd personally rather read the IRS publications."
4,Its things like this the world needs more of....,"I changed my mind after hearing the whole album, and giving this song itself a better chance...Lasgo is now to this date one of my favorite acts, but heres my old review below anyways....Its things like this that make me not respect trance music!:Need I say more? Here is the first single from Lasgo, and I'm hoping its the last, because Lasgo is nothing too impressive. I hear many people compare Lasgo to Ian van Dahl, but there is a MAJOR difference betweent the two. That difference is that Ian van Dahl is good. Ian van Dahl isn't exactly the number one composer of all time or anything like that, but there is some really great trance/techno music generated from that area. With Lasgo, the titles are all used up, nothing is new, and the lady cannot sing. She sounds like Tiffany, remember, the I think we're alone now girl? This is stuff that would have been impressive maybe 15 years ago, definitely 20 years ago, sorry guys, too late!"
5,impressive,i think this is an impressive single. first i listen and then i tried to find it on music market. it's fantastic...
2,Light Body Cheaply Made,"I bought what I thought was the top of the line in fog lamps. The lights were purchased to add to the Westin Bull Bar I added to my 05 Ford Ranger. The install was straight forward with no issues. It is hard to get the lights tightened to the point where you can not turn them by hand.After 6 months, one of the plastic lamp housing broke off at the base. I have sent several emails to Hella trying to get this issue resolved, but so far no response from them.I would not recommend this product because of the plastic housing and mounting hardware."
3,"Look cool, need replacing","These Hella Micro FF lights look pretty sweet on my old Porsche 911 but I grind them into sloped drive ways and they do attract stone ships. Really, they are for show though they do work well. I keep the covers on them almost all the time to prevent them from destruction. I've replaced two of them already. I have owned them for 6+ years and they are hella cool. I just don't see other cars with them as fog lights, especially sports cars."
3,"An ""A"" for effort.","Though a very brave first release, Harrison Act's The Sound of Things to Come only proves why there isn't more piano-driven rock out there. Ben Folds who?Listening to more than 4 songs in a row really leaves a listener numb. The songs are well written, but there is not enough diversity between the album tracks to keep a listener interested. Pick any handful of songs and you may like what you hear, but soon you will find yourself craving a change of tempo like an infant craves attention.The repetitive and unemotional drumming style contributes to the overall feeling of status-quo. No surpises here.Harrison Act's The Sound of Things to Come is a great album to play in the background, when you are not looking to focus on the music being heard. The group may have a bright future, if the lead singer learns a thing or 2 about pitch and timber."
1,Cover Your Ears,"The Harrison Act's ""A Sign of Things to Come"" might possibly the worst album I have ever listened to. Imagine the Barnum and Bailey circus on crack. Although the lead singer has potential, but needs to master pitch before he attempts to hit keys that are clearly out of his range. Track 02 transports you into what you can imagine as your worst nightmare. Forget chinese water torture, just pop this in."
3,just a question about this cd....,I just want to know if anybody knows how many and which songs are compiled in this cd ? there's no listing of any of the songs here..
5,Another great book in this series!,"After reading the first book in this series, i was hooked! i have read the mark of the crown more than 5 times, and can't wait for the next one to come out! everyone who loves star wars, and want to find out how obi-wan and Qui-gon came to be a master and apprentice should read this amazing book!"
5,Guardians of peace,"Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to Gala to oversee an election. The queen is slowly dying and feels her son Beju is unfit to rule. Amist rioting in the streets, the feared hill people, bandits, politicians and betrayal in the palace the jedi must maintain the peace. This book picks up where The Hidden Past left us and keeps you hooked threw twist and turn till the final revalation. Its a quick read but highly recommended."
4,A great book,"It is a great book but Obi-Wan doesn't have a good bond with his master like a reader before me said. You'll have read more of the apprentice books to find out if it inproves(I know). But it has drama, a little suspence, and some treachery."
5,addictive,"Once you pick it up you will be hooked. Great action and great story. Obi-Wan is my hero. Read how he saves the day in a hopeless planet and amazes Qui-Gon. Beware you're going to need all the books in the series, you won't be able to put them down."
5,Another Great Book!,I've read the whole series so far and this one is the best. No doubt about that. I recommend this book to all of you. This series is great for Star Wars lovers and non Star Wars lovers. Either way you'll enjoy this book. May the Force be with you.
5,Fun songs your kids can rock out to!,"My daughter has almost all of the Princess Bean CDs and she loves them. The songs are uplifting and have a moral, but are not sappy or Barney-ish. Messy World is story mostly told in songs and has great characters. I love the voice of the Magic Mirror! I like listening to the CD with my daughter because it is fun, educational, and it rocks!"
3,Yes! to the message & the music,"I first listened to this CD because I knew the composer's mother-in-law. Being a musician, myself, I didn't expect much from it--snob that I often am. However, I was delighted with both the music and the words. The message is one I wish I could have brought my own daughter up on--and tried to, without the aid of this CD. And now I'm very happy to be able to give it to my two grand nieces. The music will set them dancing, and the message will have them listening to it again and again. Jan"
5,Fun music with a message,My daughter is still a little young for this (only 8 months) so I lent it to my neighbor across the street and her 5 year old girl. She LOVES it and plays it often.
3,"good sound,bad plastic body.","The mp3 player sounds great,but the plastic body is too weak to resist the AAA battery pressing the head.My equipment was broken two weeks after use."
4,Lovely Pictures On my Wall now,This book was so awesome that I cut it up and framed 5 of the pictures on my wall in a collage style. people come over and love seeing them. However there are about 2 spreads of scary clowns which is freaky. But other than that every picture was so awesome it left me speechless
4,day-by-day news on the tragedy,"This is really a collection, a plethora of old newspaper articles written following the murders, at the time of the trial, and after. It's unique in giving the reader a ""feel"" for the time and atmosphere of Fall River at the time of the murders.David Rehakauthor of ""Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?"""
3,Many useful forms included in this package!,"This is a great selection of common forms but, of course, there are many forms that will not be useful to the buyer. I.e., permission forms for schools, etc. are not needed by seniors buying this product (me). Therefore, the percentage of useable forms will be fairly low. For that reason, there should be many more than 101 forms in the collection at this price. 200 forms would give it a reasonable value at this price. I have been buying Nolo products for many years and found them to be of good quality but often over-priced."
4,Useful & a Great Variety of legal Forms,These forms while not all useful are certainly of value. The book is well structured and easy to follow. The book essentially is a collection of of useful legal form aimed at various areas of the law for people with non legal backgrounds. The forms are explained in a clear and concise way and are easy to use! This is a useful book to have lying around the house!
2,Superficial coverage,"A disappointment. Rather poor, superficial coverage. Notably poor coverage of wills and estates."
3,Very basic collection of legal forms,"I was expecting more from this guide, especially since all other products from Nolo are top notch. However, the forms in this guide are extremely basic. You'll find stuff like lease agreements and loan forms but despite this being a large book, everything is very limited. The forms on the CD are all in RTF format, so they can be used by almost any computer.Sadly, the vast majority of these forms can be found online for free, including the same advise and tips published in this book. And finally, there is always the risk that people rely too much on information found in books like this and fail to consult an attorney. Sure, for many basics, you don't need one, but there are plenty of complicated things you just can't resolve with a form.Still, it is a handy collection of stuff to have around."
3,Basic,Has most of the forms that you would not need an attorney to fill out. Pretty basic. Includes the CD. Could have some more expanded forms.
2,No durable power of attorny,"I was very disappointed with the book because it did not contain a template for a durable power of attorney. The only power of attorney document I need to prepare is a durable power of attorney, and this was not included with the book, even though the Table of Contents and Index imply there is sufficient information to prepare this document."
3,simplified,even though i read review about the book not haveing durablepower of attorney i got it anyway . it had a good reference towhere i could get it . will kept for future references andsimplied forms went needed.
1,Are there pdf forms for kindle version?,"Just bought this in kindle version. I'm not really understanding the product since there is no apparent way to access electronic versions of any of the forms. I could, use ""printscreen"" I suppose.Update:There is a link inside the kindle version to a ""contact us"" page. Its a dead link though.Update:I returned the kindle version to Amazon (didn't know I could do that) and just bought the title (a large pdf) from the nolo website."
1,a bad plastic base,"i buy this product, but the quality and material it's not good i sell it to a friend,"
3,Reasonable introduction to development.,"This is a nice non-technical introduction to developmental biology, with some interesting historical insights. I agree with a previous reviewer in that the ""painting"" analogy used by the author is a bit far-fetched and tends to confuserather than clarify the subject. In any case, after reading this book I feel better equiped to prepared to face a more technical book, like Sean Caroll's ""DNA and diversity""."
3,Art analogies didn't work for me.,"I found the art analogies did not lend clarity, and in the end, I skipped past as many of them as I could. If you are very interested in art, and less about the details of molecular biology, you may like this approach."
5,Great value,These strings are a good value they came in a short time and the sound great. I recommend them to anyone who wants a good set of strings at a decent price.
1,BLECH,"This is the worst book I have read in a LOOOOONG time. The ""heroine"" is as unpleasant a written character as I have ever seen. I do not understand why authors feel that ""spunky"" has to be equal to rude and unpleasant. This book is a piece of [...] and I am sorry I bought it. I rarely have a reaction like this but in this case, I really have to hope that Karen Kendall NEVER publishes another book."
1,Not original artists,Careful on this one... it is all COVER versions of the songs mentioned. Not an original artist to be found. I was disappointed because nowhere on the Amazon page did it tell me this before I ordered.
3,Waited and Waited,"I waited and waited for this game to come out, considering I am a Backyard fan. I think this game is great for the younger crowd, as well as all backyard games. When I finally recived this product from amazon, I ran and gave it to my daughter Jennete. Jennete, being 7, was really excited! When she played the game for awhile she was kind of disapointed. First of all, the pause button didn't work so she couldn't sub in diffrent players. I don't know if that was problem was only on our disc or on the whole batch. Second, it wasn't that much diffrent than the first game. Backyard sports are great for kids, but stick with the originals, much cheaper and mcuh better!"
5,Excellent workbook!,This is a great companion tool for Twelve Extraordinary Women. It is lengthy. Be prepared to commit a fair bit of time to the study--but well worth it!
4,Serious student,"Some friends and I are doing this study. The soft back book has thought provoking questions for each chapter. (The hard back book does not have questions.) The workbook questions and comments are good, but be prepared for more reading & questions. We love the book and the way the women's lives are presented!"
2,Repetitive arguments,"It has repetitive arguments, questions and comments and because of that I ended up scanning the book rather than really enjoying the content."
5,A modest suggestion that this book should be read,"In case any reader might be put off by ""Ray from Victoria"" writing on 12 Jan 2003 ""its author is less concerned with the purity of history than with defending a right-wing, white view of the world and denigrating people like Henry Reynolds"" it should be noted that the former Marxist historian (and former journalist) Windschuttle makes just three references to Henry Reynolds, two neutral and one favourable. Ray should read the lucidly written and thoroughly researched 1996 book, The Killing of History, instead of rushing into print because Vol 1 of Windshuttle's three volume ""The Fabrication of Aboriginal History"" has just been published with much éclat and dealt a well aimed blow at ""historians"" like him. It is in that book that Henry Reynolds' failures of scholarship are scrupulously detailed. But ""The Killing of History"" does skewer perfectly some other deserving targets."
2,This is basically an anti-intellectual reactionary tract.,"Winschuttle's closed-fisted insistence that there is absoulte TRUTH to be found in history attempts to push historicism and literary criticism back 30 years. But then, maybe that's his point. In any respect, the book often comes off as more of a bitter personal attack than a well-reasoned intellectual argument. Try again."
5,One of the best books on the subject I've ever read,"Shelley Bovey is a writer on health subjects, as well as a fat woman who's been through all the guilt, humiliation, and self-loathing that fat women experience constantly, so she knows whereof she writes. She argues convincingly that weight and morality have been inappropriately intertwined: the real issue isn't health but denial of the ""untidier"" aspects of ourselves. Excellent reading for anyone who's struggled with a ""weight problem"" -- and those who love them."
5,"Relaxing, yet challenging.",This video and brain wave vibration have helped with chronic pain in my neck and back. It's also helping me with flexibility and energy. This is wonderful for any level.
2,Could be much better,This Cd is not encouraging and a bit boring; it also not too diverse. The instructor is trying to talk with Korean accent; it's very funny. I wish more dahn yoga CDs be available.
1,Don't waste your money.,"Here's another screenwriting book that by the time you finish reading it, you still have questions that need answered. I thought it would give a better ""insider's view"" than other interview type screenwriting books, but I was disappointed. You read one person's opinion who says to do it one way and just below it, you read a totally opposite opinion to do it another way. So, you're back at square one. There's better books out there."
5,Hustle & Flow,"I'm very impressed with this one. I'm not usually one to pick up movie soundtracks, but after seeing the movie and hearing a few tracks around here and there, I decided to pick this up. Good decision. This album is full of bangers, from start to finish. Very few CD's today can just ride without hitting the skip button but this is one of the few that can. There's seriously not one song on this CD that I didn't like from the very first time I heard it. It's hard to pick out a favorite, but if I had to choose one, I would say the best song on the album is Murder Game. Fresh tight beats, tight lyrics, just an overall great produced album. I would recommend this to anyone, whether you just wanna bump it in the house, a party, or ride to it, it would be perfect for any of them. *5 Stars*"
4,I picked this song for the Oscar :->,"This is a great soundtrack (better than the movie to me), and I was hoping that It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp would get the Oscar it was nominated for and it did. I'm glad for Three 6 Mafia that it did - it's a fantastic, tight song. The rest of the cd is good too, but there is no other standout song like that. I do like Whoop That Trick. Even though this music is a little heavier than I usually listen to, I still find it great and powerful and a fantastic cd to blast in the car."
2,Just buy the few good songs and leave the rest,"I'm over it. I only like two songs on the entire CD, so don't waste your money on this one. You can probably do better downloading the few songs you might like or previewing the album first."
2,Just as bad as the movie,"The movie sucked and the soundtrack follows suit. There are about two songs that are worth mentioning. T.I's Im A King feat Big Kuntry and Lil Scrappy and the very goofy but catchy Booty Language by Juvenile, Wacko and Skip. The rest of this album is filler. I dont know why they decided to put Terrence Howard's character's songs from the movie on the soundtrack but I can honestly tell you that they suck. Whoop That Trick, It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp(this song won an award?) and Hustle and Flow(It Aint Over) are about as dull as Djay's character. Even 8-Ball and MJG drop the ball on Tell Me Why. T.I had the only verse worth talking about on Murda Game with P$C and Carbon 15's A.K.'s Mac 11's by Boyz N Da Hood sounds like leftover that was left off of their first album for a reason. In short the soundtrack stinks and is not worth your money. Its just as weak as the movie was."
4,Good Album,"This album was a very good for a soundtrack. Many of the songs on here are good, my favorite ones are Im a king remix-P$C, Carbon 15's, A.K.'s & Mac 11's - Boyz N Da Hood,and Booty Language- Juvenile..Overall i thought this album was good and you should buy it as soon as you can.. i would recomend this album to everyone! enjoy!"
5,great,i revied this with my husband and the musio was wonderful. the whole tape was great. you get 10 stars for this.
4,cd,I was happy with everthing except the time it took to get it. Usually I get things in good time through you guys but it seemed to take a lot longer to recieve this.
4,Where is the gospel song??,"I thought the moviewas pretty cool and so is the soundtrack but any how, I just need to know what the name of song is that the woman was singing in the church. I thought it was beautiful and would love to know the name. (...)Thank you"
4,HUSTLE & FLOW_ A WINNER!,"Hustle & Flow is a good movie. I definitely respect this effort from the writers of this film because I've been through things myself and I see what's goin on out here in this life everyday and most of the things are on point. It could've had more of a plot to the movie and more hustlin but I guess too much reality would be givin up game cuz you can't expose the streets all the way even though these Hollywood moviemakers go all out to do it and most haven't ever spent a day in the hood in their lives but are gettin paid off our story. Anyway, the movie is straight to the point and simple but it's respectable. Those who've stuggled in life and who have dreams and see how hard it is to make these dreams a reality will feel this movie. The music is pretty good, just the tip of the iceberg from what the south really has to offer.MEMPHIS, TN BY WAY OF MISSISSIPPI"
3,"Julio, your review couldn't be any more racist.","Hey Julio, it you haven't seen the movie and you haven't listened to the soundtrack - how did you come up with your assessment of this product. Oh wait - this was just a way for you to make some silly underlying racist comments without getting beat up. Under the cloak of the internet and our keyboards we can all be what we wanna be. Cool, I think I'm gonna be Obi Wan Kenobi today!Oh, as for Hustle & Flow Soundtrack, well, it's pretty mediocre. The music as a soundtrack while watching the movie is great but as a standalone cd to sit and listen to for a half hour is not so good. The movie is WAY better than I had expected. 5 Star Movie but a 3 Star soundtrack."
5,Great Soundtrack,"I like this album a lot and the songs are all great and get me crunked up. My favorite of course is the song ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"" and the rest are great too. I seen the movie to and I also recommend that you get both this and the movie. If you like hard beats and good lyrics then this album is for you."
5,Hustle & Flow Soundtrack......,"Is off the hook. Taraji brings cuts like ""It's kinda hard out there for a pimp"" and Keep Hustling and Flowing"" Her jazzy blusey voice is amazing.The dirty south rappers are on point with the music on the cd. Make more like this please.[...]"
3,Not Impressed,Hustle & Flow is okay in terms of a hip hop/rap movie. I have seen better from T. Howard. The soundtrack has some of the biggest rappers on it but as a whole the soundtrack is nothing I can't wait to buy. Not Impressed.
3,hustle & flow,"I am not a rap music fan so most of the music on the cd was not my cup of tea. i bought the cd because i like ""it's hard out there for a pimp"" so..."
1,horrible soundtrack for a horrible flick,"if you can sit through this entire movie, then you are a much braver and hardier soul than i. stupid movie with terrible songs. is this music?avoid"
5,LOVE IT!,GREAT WITH CAR SPEAKERS UNLESS IF YOU HAVE A HUGE SPEAKERS AT HOME IS GREAT TOO... GREAT BASS AND SUCH!
2,Hustle and Flow soundtrack,"I liked all of the tunes that the main character in the movie was suppose to have sung, but for me, pure gangsta rap rings like a dying art. There is an outright redundancy to the use of similar, derogatory street language that after a while just falls flat and takes on an immaturity that is undenyable on the inspiring art chart. All of the phony lines about murdering, drugging, robbing and living outside (meant to be above) the law seems to drone on, as if expressed by untalented, whiny bitches, rather than true musical innovators. The album does contain some bright spots, so it doesn't appear a total loss, but if you are looking for the kind of raw heart that the actual movie had, you may just be disappointed here. Definitely, buy at your own risk, because most of the material on this CD reeks of overly pretended violence spat by children in a play yard."
5,Its Hard out here!,"This grammy winning album is well worth it. It goes just as hard now as when the movie came out! For all you collectors this is the first grammy for a hip hop soundtrack, keep a piece of this History."
1,Terribly disappointed,No wonder they won't show a picture of these. Even Elton John on his worst day wouldn't wear these sunglasses.
4,LOST PROPHETS ARE AMAZING!,"So, I first saw this band live before I heard them on cd. They were playing with Hoobastank, and lemme tell you, they rock, they really do. All the songs are just way cool, and they use a dj, who also sings and its just freakin awesome. All the tracks are really fun and cool, and its just an awesome cd to buY! yay for LP!"
5,Best First effort from the UK since Pablo Honey!,"This is the best album that I've heard in a long while. I've been playing it in my car for almost two weeks straight. The more I listen to it the more I like it. If you have Gnutella or Audio Galaxy download ""ShinobivsDragonNinja"" and ""FiveisaFourLetterWord"". If you love those tracks half as much as I do you will buy this CD. This band will be big! I compare this first album of the Lost Prophets with the first efforts from GREAT bands like U2, Radiohead, Incubus & Deftones. Pick this up! You won't be sorry!"
3,Lostprophets is a modern day Faith No More,"I don't understand why everyone is trying to compare Lostprophets to bands like Incubus. They are clearly 100% influenced by Faith No More and to a lesser extent Mr. Bungle. The lead singer is trying very hard to capture the vocal talents of Mike Patton, but there are very few people in the world that can match him.That said, I don't think that the CD is too bad. I'd suggest checking out Faith No More's Angel Dust or Mr. Bungle's California if you like this CD."
4,Great music...terrible production,"I'm surprised Sony would let a horrible mix such as this see the light of day. Are those drums or cardboard boxes? That said, Lostprophets display impressive songwriting skills on thefakesoundofprogress. If this CD didn't sound like it was recorded in one of the blokes' garages, I would've given this a 5 star rating."
4,sound-a-likes,"I was reading through the reviews americans had written about Lostprophets and was shocked that someone said they sounded like Linkin Park. OMG you have to be joking!Lostprophets are one of the amazing bands that have stormed the UK and i find, just like other Lostprophet fans, it is an insult to be compared the same to Linkin Park!As america does have really good bands like cKy, it does show that endland is catching on with the likes of InMe and Hundred Reasons, but you cant say that Lostprophets sounds like Linkin Park beacuse Linkin Park as I'm sure your aware of are very tacky and aren't exactly what you call ""pure"" rock. They are fake. Lostprophets album is one of my personal favourites and its an amazing CD, BUY IT NOW! (DEATH TO ALL FALSE METAL)"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST CDS EVER,"If you don't own THE FAKE SOUND OF PROGRESS, get to the nearest outlet and buy it!!! Now!! This CD has everything anybody could ask for!! It's got great guitar and drum stuff, great lyrics, great singing, great instrumental stuff, GREAT MUSIC!!! Some of their instrumental stuff sounds a tad like the Beastie Boys, which is the best stuff ever!! Most people have probably heard ""Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja"" on the radio, and, yes, that's a great song, but it's only a tiny bite of everything that makes up the Lostprophets. If you ask me (and even if you don't, I'm telling you anyway), GET THIS CD NOW!!! (Oh, and try to go to Ozzfest to see them live, too!!)"
2,It's Ok....,I really only like a couple tracks on this cd. In all honesty I spend more time skipping tracks then listening to the few I like.
1,Over Hyped Big Heads,"I'm from Wales, in fact I'm from the same town as the lost Prophets and I've seen them countless times. I saw their first ever performance and have chatted with the boys a few times. The album is a re issue of the same album that they released a year previouse to this one. The original of the album is a little slower but is also heavier and much better than this version. When are they going to actually have an original release and when are these guys going to stop wearing makeup. Are they trying to look like back street boys?"
5,Great debut album,"I was introduced to this band a couple years ago by a friend and I really liked thier heavy sound with Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja. So I bought this CD and was very impressed. The singer has a very distinct voice that switches from melodic to powerful screaming that keeps me interested. Plus they have real heavy guitar riffs that punch you in the face. I also own Start Something and this is much better I think.Fav songs: Shinobi, Five is a four letter word, Kobrakai."
5,Ausie Rockstars Hit Home in the US,"The first time I heard one of these guys songs, with their incredible instrumentals and &quot;REAL&quot; lyrics, they shot right up to the top of personal Top Ten List. I have never heard anything like this and after listening to it, I never want to hear any other 'brand' of music again. From the first strum of &quot;Shinobi vs. the Dragon Ninja Clan&quot; you're hooked, listening to each individual word of every song you just can't do anything but crank it up. I honestly think that if given the chance the Lost Prophets will be seen by all as they are seen by me, simply the best. I can guarantee that you will never hear anything quite like this. ENJOY!!"
4,Great Tunes,Overall the CD is very solid and you can tell there really unpolished. Definitely more room for this band to get bigger and better without the main streamness of today's MTV bands :-P. I definitely recommend this CD to any rock fan as you won't be displeased.
4,Old school Incubus with a fresh spin,"This band is not a rip-off of Incubus, but it is likely they made an impression. Tracks such as ""Kobrakai"" sound a bit like older Incubus, but it sounds more new and energetic due to the contrasting lead guitar and bass sounds on each song. The vocals are somewhat more whiney, giving the album a little more of a punk-rock sound, but not to the extent of many annoying punk vocals. This is an upcoming band with a lot of talent and a fantastic debut album. If you enjoy bands like P.O.D and Alien Ant Farm you might want to check this one out."
2,Start Something Hopefully Is Better,"After I heard Last Train Home (which is AWESOME), I decided to find out more about Lostprophets. I bought this CD, even though Last Train Home isn't on it. A few songs are good, but nothing is incredibly fantastic. I liked the interludes, though. To the people who compare it to Linkin Park: I'll quote another reviewer, but I love Linkin Park, so it's in an opposite light; OMG, what are you thinking?!?!Bottom line is, a few songs are worth listening to. Download a few first, then decide if it's worth buying the whole album. I suppose they're not really my thing. ^^"
1,Vocals are Horrid,I cant believe you people are so lost. I checked them out because of Shinobi. The rest of it was a rip off joke. The vocals are terrible.
3,just another aight cd,yo dl some songs listen to them carefully and if you like them buy it. it is not a bad cd
3,"It's good, but they need to develop their own style","It's nice to hear a new band these days that doesn't scream and swear as loud and as much as they can. Lostprophets sound like what Incubus would sound like if they made Morning View at age 17. They have a lot of musical energy and the vocalist has a pretty good range, but can sound a little too whiny/cocky at times. The lyrics could use a bit of work too, especially ""Ode To Summer,"" which sounds like it was written for 7th graders. But still, it beats a lot of the newer stuff, and I'm sure their next album will blow this one out the water. If you like alternative-metal, you will want to check this out."
5,best band ever,"if u like linkin park, you'll like these guys. i first heard shinobi vs. dragon ninja, from a freind, and ever since, i've loved their music. as most of the other people said, they're not as dark as linkin park. but they're also not like incubus very much. however, they're the best nu-metal i've heard, and their cd is great."
4,"the substitute for any ""bad"" album from korn & Limp bizkit","When I bought the album, I didn't know what to expect. ""Shinobi"" was a song that grew on me so I took a chance and bought the album. The riffs are fast and bone crunching, and the vocals are crisp and have great melody. This is what should have sold the most cds in 2001, not Linkin Park. So this is an album for all the hoodies, skate boarders, and kids who wear only rock tshirts."
5,The Real Sounds Of Progress,"Most people have been introduced to the prophets from there single ""Last Train Home"".Amd for that reason i will say that if you where introduced to them by songs of Start Something then this album might not be your interest because there isnt a Last Train Home on this album.But Anyways the prophets show that they may have a Dj but that doesnt mean they are anything like counterparts Incubus & Linkin Park. The are heavier then incubus but not as dark as Linkin Park.Songs like ""Shinobi Vs. Dragonninja"",""Kobrakai"", ""Handsome Life of Swing"" can get you wanting to start a pit in your room. songs like ""ode to summer"" and ""5 is 4 letter word"" keeps you grooving. Personally the best songs on here are ""Shinobi Vs. Dragonninja"" ""The Fake Sounds of Progress"" ""Kobrakai"" & ""Still Laughing"". So yea if you like any of there singles definitely check out this album and give it a try."
5,The Real Sounds of Progress,"As most people by now who are relative metal-heads or Alt-rock outkasts have probably heard of Lostprophets through songs such as ""Last Train Home"" & ""Make A Move"" but besides that most people havent heard really anything from or about them until now. Well this just happens to be your lucky day because as a old-skool prophets fan i can tell you that this album shows how heavy they can get and how unique they really are. Songs such as ""Shinobi Vs. Dragonninja"" & ""The Fake Sounds Of Progress"" are a perfect representation of this band. While songs like ""Kobrakai"" & ""The Handsome Life of Swing"" can keep your head banging and wanting more. They manage to get heavier then there peers (Linkin Park,hoobastank & incubus)Overall this album shows why the hype back in 01 was such a hype. But i warn people who got into this band after ""Last Train Home"" be careful because this just might be a little too heavy for you."
5,Dyson DC15 Animal,"This is an amazing vacuum. I used it on our floors the first day and was surprised by the amount of dirt it picked up. I thought at first it was removing the fibre from the carpet. But after inspection found that it was dog hair, dirt, and dust bunnies. We vacuumed just a few days ago with our old vacuum so this speaks to the quality and efficiency of this product."
3,Suction not as strong as Hoover Windtunnel,"I do LOVE this vacuum, the ball makes it so easy to operate and it is surprisingly QUIET. I wanted to point out though, that the suction power is markedly less than my Hoover Windtunnel. I know they make Dyson's that have more power than the DC-15, but then there is no ball... so my recommendation is that this vacuum is great, but if you really need a lot of power and would like to save $$$, go for the Self Propelled Windtunnel that is under $200, buying the Dyson actually made me appreciate the Hoover's power that I took for granted."
5,A Real Vacuum,"Now when we vacuum, there really are clean carpets. Notice huge difference throughout our home."
4,"Great Suction, a Little Hard to Maneuver","The vacuum is great if you own pets...it gets the dog hair like nothing I have ever seen. However, it can be a little difficult to maneuver. Also, the cord is very long, but it ALWAYS gets twisted and knotted up. Finally, it is a little heavy..I wouldn't recommend it for older individuals or those with back problems if you have a multi floor residence. Other than those few cons, it is a great vacuum, the proof is in the canister."
3,Obviously built by a man,"This is a good vacuum but difficult to use. The only real animal hair thing about it is the very large attachment mainly to be used on furniture. It is very hard to use the stick because you have to totally unwrap the wire, pull out the stick attach it to the hose and then use it. Also it has absolutely no edge power. It leaves an obvious 1 inch mark where it just doesn't ""suck"". So you do have to end up going around the room with the stick. For the money just buy a good bagless vacuum and you will get the same for your money. I bought a Hoover and it is great for the downstairs because also this vacuum is very heavy and hard to bring up and down stairs!!"
2,Not Up To The Hype,"I purchased this vacuum about a year and a half ago and curse it everytime I take it out of the closet. Yes, it has great suction for dog hair and dust but don't try anything much larger. You might as well pick it up by hand. But that isn't the problem here. This unit in addition to a questionable design has one of the CHEAPEST power cables you could put on a vacuum. At almost six hundred dollars for this unit I am appalled. The plastic I can deal with but not putting on a high quality power cable is just wrong. Dyson should be ashamed of themselves. On top of that forget using the attachements. It is just dumb. Obviously designed by someone who thought they were clever but doesn't live in the real world. Forget cute and make it work. For $250 this would be an ok machine but at $599 it just isn't worth it."
4,Great on pet hair but has the weight of a vintage Buick!,Being a Dyson this model can suck up small farm animals without pausing to chew. The DC15 is a tad on the heavy side and doesn't have the height adjustment the non-ball model has so carpet/rug edges confuse the poor beast. Overall it's Kung-Foo is strong but it's size does not give you the Zen feeling.
2,Good suction but scratches floors badly,Have had this vacuum for several years now. Worked great on carpeted floors but we recently remodeled our house with all African Walnut. Unfortunately the Dyson has resulted in significant scratches on the floors due to the very small hard plastic wheels under the head. Now looking for something more hardwood friendly.
1,It doesn't suck.,"I have a Dyson Animal, and I hate it. To say something doesn't suck, is good, unless that something happens to be a vacuum cleaner. I have to go over areas repeatedly to get it to pick up visible dust. (I can imagine what it's leaving behind that I can't see.) It's unwieldy, and doesn't get under furniture unless you take the time to reassemble the beast in a transformers sort of way. The pet hair attachment is equally ineffective. Some people like it. I just say, try it before you buy something this expensive."
5,Works Great.,This is my second Animal that I have purchased from Dyson. One for upstairs and one for downstairs. My first Dyson does not have the ball and the second one that I just purchase has the ball. I don't know how but this Dyson works better then my other Dyson. The new vacuum works great and is very easy to move around furniture and other items on the floor. The suction is great and the vacuum is very quiet. The 5 year warranty is another plus.
5,"Works great, good design, could use a few refinements","Overall I am very happy with the Duson DC15 Animal. It is vastly superior to the Kenmore upright with bag that this is replacing.What I like:1: Cleans very well2: Lightweight and easy to manuever3: Easy to clean4: Rugged5: Cord is very flexible6: Gorgeous looking, it's a work of art reallyWhat I would like changed:1: Getting the hose with extension tube/handle loose is a little awkward, and the hose without it is too short2: The attachments tend to come out of their holding spots a little too easilyNice to have maybe:3: Cord retractor would be nice, but would add to the weight and size so maybe not worth it unless Dyson comes up with something clever :)"
5,Dyson DC15,Great vacuum! Took awhile to figure out all the functions but performs great and is quiet!!
1,Mine clogs,My Dyson Animal clogs - incessantly. And it has from almost the beginning. It was not close to worth its price.
2,Animal hair still wraps around brush,"Disappointed with my Dyson purchase regarding picking up animal hair. We have a long-haired golden retriever, and the brush has to be continually cleaned because the hair wraps around the brush roller like a thick pad. It isn't easy to get to the brush and requires some effort to remove it each time. Since the vacuum was designed for animal hair, I assumed they had solved the ""hair around the bristle"" problem present with all vacuums. My Hoover bagless windtunnel actually works better as far as the dog hair goes."
5,"Not just a vacuum, it's a tool!!!","My Kenmore went belly up and I got this after reviewing the features at the Dyson website. It does all it says and more!!! I couldn't get it away from my husband he loved it so much! The suction was far superior to our last cleaner. The hose was integrated into the cleaner so you didn't have to search for the hose extention. We have a dog and it picked up more dog hair than our last. I'd say that it is almost a 100% improvment in picking up dog hair than our Kenmore. Plus the ball feature made it easy to manuever around furniture. Some have issues with this feature because it uses you wrist a bit more than a conventional cleaner but I haven't had a problem. Very easy to empty the dirt and hair container, one button and the bottom swings open into your trash can. Excellent attachments, our stairs have never looked so clean. All in all, The Ball Animal has exceeded our expectations and been worth the high cost!!!"
5,No other vacuum can touch this one!,"Ease of use, well thought out design, superior carpet cleaning (makes my old carpet stand up like new!) tidy disposal of dirt, and cool looking on top of all that! I never thought I would say vacuuming is fun!!!!"
5,It does suck,The best vacuum I have ever owned. Was using Wind Tunnel Self Propeled but this puts that to shame. It is very easy to change from carpet to bare floors with the touch of a button. One of the features I like best is it will go over throw rugs without sucking them into the carpet brush. I guess this sums it up. I have two dogs and a cat. I was emptying my wind tunnel bag about every 4 or 5 times I used it. I have to empty the Dyson almost every time because it picks up so much more pet hair. I highly recommend it.
3,It's only OK for the price,"I bought the dyson Animal vaccum about 2 years ago now and I don't know if I would spend this much on a vaccum again. I have had to take it in to be professionally cleaned at least once a year. The first time I did that the Dyson approved dealer told me there was no difference betweent the animal version (purple- and the one I have) and the normal version (yellow and about $100 cheaper). He said they used the same parts and did the same thing. The suction is great when it is fully operational, but for the money we paid for the vaccum, I wouldn't expect all the follow up to ensure optimal performance."
5,Best darn vaccuum ever,"The Dyson DC15 Animal is by far the best vaccuum cleaner we've ever owned. We've been married for 38 years, 3 children, 4 grandchildren and have NEVER been without at least 1 dog and a couple of cats in the house. That's a BIG need for a good vaccuum. The Dyson is the one. The real acid teast is whether is still works as well a year or two from now. From all the reviews I've read, we have nothing but good things to look forward to."
4,Works well,It has a very strong suction which is a must for a good vacuum. Like the fact that it has a ball and can turn easily. Only downside is that it is kind of heavy!!
3,Concerned,"Well it is a nice machine. But for spending more than twice the amount for a compliable machine I would think it would last longer.I had the DC15 ""Ball"" vacuum for less than three months when the main vacuum motor gave out. The Brush motor works fine, but without the main vacuum motor it is worthless.So now I have to send it back to Dyson.Long, long wait (did I mention long wait) for a customer rep to finally speak to me, just to say send the vacuum back to them.Overall nice machine But BUY THE EXTRA WARRANTIES if offered by the store. You will need them (especially for the price). My Hoover wind tunnel was 1/2 of the price and now I am back to using it once again (lasted over ten years)"
1,Terrible Vaccum,"I'm glad that I got to use this @ work before buying it!!! I found that it wouldn't pick up M&M's that a kid had spilled on the floor or small pieces of paper, it doesn't have an edge cleaner, it blows lint up into the air, and the hose and attachments are not easy to use. Not to mention, it is bulky and won't fit under furniture or cabinet edges. It took me awhile to figure out how to ""drop"" the base so I could push it around, no foot lever! I had to place one foot on the base to hold it down while I tipped the body back. I'll stick with my Hoover Wind Tunnel for now."
1,Worst Vacuum I've ever had,"I realize I am in the minority when it comes to a Dyson - but this vacuum is very (very) overrated. Yes, it does a good job on carpets/pet hair, but that's IT. Try spilling some rice on the floor - the Dyson can't get it up, you'll vacuum over (and over and over) that little speck on the floor, because the Dyson will zoom right over it and not grab it. Forget picking up the stray coin, or the beans from the beanie baby that the dog ripped open - you'll drive yourself crazy! This vacuum is heavy, bulky, awkward and hard to maneuver around and under furniture and other things. The ""stick"" is too small and too short as well.I.HATE.THIS.VAC!!"
1,Bagless = Bad,"Work at shop 5yrs. filtration poor, eventually will leak dust see it all the time. filters clog + inner hard to clean. Inner cyclone assm. builds up dust, nearly impossible to get out. Belts impossible to replace, says on box all dyson not for delicate carpets. I find it funny the asthma foundation supports this vacuum cleaner when it does not have ""S"" class filtration which is best. take it from me invest in a sebo, my fav or a miele or riccar."
1,"Godawful Design, Bad Ergonomics, Breaks Your Back","After 1.5 years, the design has not changed.The hose completely came apart. It weighs a TON and has the DUMBEST, lousiest design ever.1. cannot vacuum under furniture because it is so large,2. the hardwood floor attachment pushes stuff around because the bristles block the suction3. the hose and entire design are incredibly akward --to get suction the hose will bend and block air, thus you must often hold + unbend the hose while simultaneously vacuuming.4. you will injure your back with the weight of this beast.5. save your money, it breaks just like the cheaper brands, and the hose replacement is well over $1006. So after 1.5 years of a broken back, you can have my piece of dirt for free and I'm going to buy a new cannister every year as they break all the time anyhow."
2,not worth it,"unfortunately this vacuum does not work as well as an old dirt devil it was designed to replace. the canister ""dump"" is nice - but suction is not as advertised - and unit is heavy and difficult to use.may be good compared to many - but would not purchase again"
5,Amazing!,"I purchased this pen in hopes that my penmanship would improve...and it did..dramatically! I have the extra fine nib which is surprisingly great for me. I can finally make drastic letter changes and they look sleek and professional! This nib does flex and I really love how smooth it lays down ink. I can't say how the flex is compared to all other pens as I am a beginner with fountain pens. I plan on purchasing another one in a different size nib soon! I have been waiting for this pen for a long time and yes, its very, very light! I am happy with this pen and I hope you will be too! Cheers!"
4,Great pen. Occasional flow problems,"I got this pen after reading many reviews. The pen is beautifully designed and works great. The flexible tines make decorative writing very easy. This pen is a bit wetter than other pens that I'm used to, so using it on normal paper doesn't work very well. Also occasionally when I am writing on more slick paper like Rhodia, the pen will stop flowing for no reason, but other than that. It's a great pen."
2,Disappointing,This is the review for the medium nib. First the good. The pen is light but feels well balanced. The flexible nib has a nice feel on the paper. Unfortunately there seems to be too much ink flowing and it over-saturates the paper and shows through to the other side. I have tested two Namiki Falcon pens with different inks and several papers. The problem was presented with all ink/paper combinations to a lesser or greater extent. The Lamy Safari and a $1 chinese pen did not have any problem. I have contacted Namiki support in Florida and they did not have anything useful to suggest. Very disappointing for a pen in this price range.
3,A Diamond Set in Cheap Plastic,"The most perfect nib I've ever written with is 98% of Pilot's investment in this pen. Unfortunately they spent the other 2% on a cheap, thin, feather-light and unremarkable-looking plastic cap and barrel without a single metal fitting. Ive simply never spent 140.00 on a pen made with such cheap components. Why would Pilot want to put their name and one of the world's best nibs into one of the world's cheapest looking pens? I don't get it."
2,Not so good,"This fountain pen is not good because ink is flow out. Now, this is not useful for me. I disappointed with this fountain pen."
3,It's ok but...,"I have heard remixes of these vocal greats, but this is not a good one by any means. I squeezed ou 1-2 worth listening to. The rest of it puts your mind to sleep."
4,Great for my Oktoberfest party,"I use this cd every year for my Oktoberfest party because it's full of happy, beer drinking tunes that makes my party that much more authentic."
5,best Irma's album,"I think Cybophonia is the best artist of the italian label Irma.This is a chillout record full of ethereal atmospheres, jazzy tracks, electronica and lounge: the perfect soundscape for a relaxing trip.Dreamers, lovers, smokers and chillout kids: this killer album will be your dope."
3,Good Start,"This book seems to contain a lot of good, useful information. If there are no complications to your situation, I highly recommend it.But if your situation does not fall into the government prescribed guidelines or requirements, it doesn't provide much assistance.If you are a student on a Visa who wants to stay on, a gay or lesbian who wants to stay with their partner, an illegal, etc., you won't find the answers here."
4,Good shape and quick,"book arrived quickly and in very good shape, thxs would purchase from this vendor again."
3,Big Rf Spanish Verbs with CD-ROM,"It is a good book for learning basic Spanish. The book has many useful example sentences, which are very useful. It is bulky so I use only when I can't find words in more compact book such as ""Everything Spanish Verb Book"" by Lawless. I feel the CD-ROM came with the book is not so useful for a person who try to concentrate on verb conjugation. It is almost a lecture book all by itself. They should have considered a lecture format which is more covenient and simple in storing in iPod or like. Wish it was a simple CD without fanfares, not CD-ROM. Again the book, however, is very useful."
5,Stunning!,"This video is not only for the hard core fan, but even the casual sports person, like me. The little known facts,the rich history,and the great old video's and photos make this a must have for any Spartan fan, or Basketball fan for that matter."
3,eh,"The last 100 pages were good. The rest was way too wordy, and, as a female, insulting at times with the pigeon-holing of what the author thinks are 'female' characteristics. I bought it for the cryonics theme, and got a good amount of that, but otherwise, the storyline didn't capture me until at least 400 pages in, and then didn't really wow me until the last 100."
4,Great for Pre-K through 1st Graders,Quick book packed with fun. About 100 - 130 words. Sure to put a smile on the kids faces while they read the book with you. I like to ask what they think the animal should have gotten for their gift.The animals who receive the gifts in this book aren't sure what do and very cute illustrations too!
1,Lousy,"This is one of the worst books of I have seen for standardized test practice.If you are a parent who is clueless as to what your child may be doing in school all day, then this book might be for you. There is very little practical application, few test problems. The book centers around how to teach your child all the concepts that may be covered on a standardized test for third grade.Don't be misled by the advertisement on the cover ""includes real sample test"". It's a sample, not much of a sample, and not much practice for your child. This book is over-priced and a huge disappointment. There are lots of good, free resources on the internet that are superior to this series."
1,Poor standard,I am very disappointment with the content - mostly advice to parents than practice test. Only few pages for the test. Standard is very poor - for below average kids.
4,A Solid Release that I've Been Waiting For,"I found this band maybe a month before they got signed to Rise Reocrds. I downloaded all the songs by them on their ep and others that were out before this record, and I listened to them a lot. So with this cd I shall do the same. Uh as far as the cd goes, its a great one and a definite worthwhile purchase. To describe the way the band sounds is quite simple, they are a metalcore band with some integration of death metal and emo style singing. It's a great mix and I dont think it could be done as well by anyone else. The cd gets 4.5 stars due to the fact that it is very good, however i didnt give it a perfect 5 stars because it has some songs on it that i all ready knew from beofore. So lack of new material is the reason. I still highly recommend this cd for fans of hardcore and metal."
3,"Great band, but...","This a great christian and Godly band...I thought until I saw the lyrics. It's great that they say Jesus and God and Lord. But the line, ""Chainsaw Brutality, Tornado Strength"" from the song Dogs Can Grow Beard All Over, is kind of gross. I understand that it's about a martyr and the troubles he'll have to go through, but coudn't they say it in a less gross way? It's almost as if they're glorifying death. But I do like that they look to Jesus in the end of the song. It's just that you have to get through the disgusting stuff to get to the good part. FWI: Do NOT buy their CD Plagues. That one is full of gross and gory stuff."
5,"Dear Love, is in my top 3 best albums by The Devil Wears Prada.","If you Like Christian Metal-Core, than I would recommend it. This music is so exciting. It's such a rush, because it's full of intense emotion. This music is not repetitive at all, it's just full of surprises. Music is poetry, not all poems sound pleasant to every one. But if you can relate to it, that's the best feeling in the world. The Devil Wears Prada gives me so much joy, to me it's uplifting and it always makes me giggle. I don't play any musical instruments, I'm not a vary good critic, but I know what I love. Out of all of the metal core music, The Devil wears Prada is my favorite. They can express themselves in new and exciting ways unlike any thing I've ever heard. I've been a fan for four years, when I first heard of them."
2,Only good for certain applications,"My front license plate holder on my Lincoln Navigator fell off and my dealer didn't have the plastic pop-rivets for sale. I have metal pop-rivets and a metal pop-rivet gun, but these would not work. I found the size of rivet needed and bought this gun (setter) as well. You will notice on the picture that the application end is flush. On my metal pop rivet gun, the application end has a ""snout"" that can fit in recessed areas. Because this did not, I was unable to get the gun close enough to where the rivet needed to be set. I ended up using a stack of metal washers to hole the rivet in place and pulled the rivet shaft out with vice-grips."
5,scratch box,"LARGE, WIDE SCRATCH BOX. THIS IS A WELL MADE, STURDY BOX. MY CATS LOVE IT AND IS DURABLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT."
3,expensive cardboard,"Sure wish these scratch boxes were more reasonably priced. After all, they are simply corrugated cardboard, which I cannot believe cost much to produce."
3,It works,"My cats did scratch this scratchy box into quick submission. It worked as intended and got heavily used. Seeing how fast my three cats completely shredded it; however, I have only bought cheaper boxes since. Cheaper boxes last about the same, and I will end up saving a lot of money getting them in the long run."
5,Oh how the cats love these!,"I live in a 3 cat household and have one of these upstairs, and one downstairs. The cats love to work out the paws on them. I would say that these last about 6-8 months."
3,Cats won't touch it,"Maybe I'm the only person with this experience, but my cats won't touch this thing. They scratch my couch, the cat pots, and pretty much anything else, but they literally will not touch this. I've put the catnip powder all over it, according to the directions, but I can't get them to scratch it. Maybe others will have better luck, but I'm returning mine."
5,CARPET SAVER!,"Our cat was only using the sisal scratchers once in awhile but much preferred to scratch our new shag-type rug instead :-( However, Jackson Galaxy recommended the horizontal cardboard scratchers for carpet scratchers so we decided, what have we got to lose? We were skeptical to say the least. Well, Rusty ONLY uses this scratcher and ignores the carpet completely - he just loves it! He loves the tassels too! He also loves to chew the cardboard sides of the scratcher as well but that's not a big deal since it didn't cost a lot and is cheaper than some replacement pads out there. Rusty pretty much ignored the catnip but he ignores most catnip. Give this a try and save your carpet and furniture. By the way, we also later got a vertical cardboard scratcher but Rusty much prefers the horizontal variety."
5,My Cats Love It!,"The size of this scratchy box is perfect, even for my horribly overweight cat. She loves sitting on it. It's her favorite place to be. The free toy is great, too. My kitten had a blast playing with it (until he lost it). I'm waiting for the cardboard to wear down so I can buy another. It's a win-win. My fat cat gets to scratch and sit, my little kitten gets a toy to play with."
4,Product rating,"The product was as described - compacted cardboard, in a box, to be scratched.It has tassles on each corner (as shown in photo), which my cat was very interested in, but he started to EAT the bits of cotton from the corner tassles.Would recommend to cat owners with indoor cats (but cut the tassles off before you give it to them)."
5,Cat scratcher,"My three cats love, love, love this product!! I have purchased other brands and styles, but the cats definitely prefer this one. I highly recommend it and it was the best price."
5,Awesome Scratcher!,As soon as I took it out of the packaging my cats were on it. They love it and use it a lot!
5,Happy cat,"My cat Sushi has been hanging out on these for a while now. What can I say besides, she loves it! She scratches this instead of our furniture and then lays on it to get brushed afterwords. Thanks for saving our furniture and giving Sushi a comfortable place to relax that she can call her own."
5,Better than the others!,"I initially ordered one of these because it was less expensive than the ones in the store. When I received it, I quickly realized it was also superior to any cardboard scratcher I had purchased before. You can easily use both sides, and while I've seen others claim the same, there's usually glue involved. This also comes with a nice toy, and catnip. It seems to last longer, and I have now ordered several despite the fact the price has gone up considerably. Oh, and the cat loves it! It's perfect for those ""well fed"" kitties."
5,Kitty is nuts about this thing!,"Our cat LOVES this scratcher box. It took her about a month to finally use it (slow learner?), but now she's scratchin' on it all the live long day. She's always like ""Imma go gets a mani/pedi combo on mah scratcher boxx..meow."" It also came with an little toy that she LOVES. Must be full of 'nip."
5,Kitty Heaven,"I bought two of the Scratchy Boxes for my 3 boys. At least one is always in use. In addition they are really cute, better than the plain ones for sale at the local store. And my guys like the free toy that come with. A great deal!"
2,uninspiring- faulty CD,Echoes of a Waterfall Harp Music CD... The CD is flawed..has a stop in it every turn. The music is uninspiring and bland in general.
4,Thumbs up from lambda land,This book is an excellent introduction to optical networking for applications engineers (AE's) and systems engineers (SE's) who need to get up speed on optics but don't need to wade through 150+ pages of graduate level mathematics. Dutton is required reading at several optical startups that are re-treading internetworking SE's into optics guys. The downside is the publication date--quite a while in networking. Overall analysis: best introduction for technical guys that is currently available.
4,Interesting stuff,"If you've ever wondered how optical communications works, from the nature and physics of fiber optics to digital wavelength mutliplexing, this is the book to have."
5,Shamanism and Tantra in the Himalayas,The book is just wonderful and it was shipped very quickly. Thank you!
5,"Great Product, Find it Cheaper Elsewhere","I love the Procion fiber reactive dyes. I use them in Shibori style resistance dying, and they always give such vibrant color! The turqoise is no different. However, this product can be found cheaper elsewhere, so check out your local craft shop before ordering from Amazon."
5,"It's creepy and it's kooky, mysterious and spooky...","One of the darkest collections of paper I've ever held in my hands has to be ""the creeps"".From your worst nightmares and most terrible dreams comes the imagery and horror that is Darren Frydendall's latest collection of art. Highly detailed and deadly accurate are monsters, creatures and the very sordid muses that have become what we know of as fear today."
5,Very enjoyable.,This is for the Naxos AudioBooks edition of Pride and Prejudice. I love the story and I thought this medium was a great way to experience it. The narrator did a wonderful job speaking as each character in the story. The narration was pleasant and very well done.
3,Great for long trips,"This is a long book, but a great romantic classic. I enjoyed the audio version as I spent long hours on the highway. Well narrated."
2,Boooooring,"Definitely not worth buying. I had to buy it because I'm a french major and I had no choice, but if you do, then don't buy the book."
1,Poor quality...what a shame,"My 4 year old son was thrilled to see that I bought him ""Ka Chow"" underwear (Lightning McQueen) underwear.The waistband quickly unraveled within the first few washings. I returned them to the store explaining what happened and refused to buy anymore from the manufacturer."
1,Not pleased!,"I too, am not happy! We bought them and they have unraveled only I thought it was a fluke and bought more, and they too unraveled. I did buy another, from another store and they seem to be OK so far."
1,Not even Cars,"I ordered these underwear for my son so we could start potty training him. I though it would make it easier saying don't pee pee on Lightning McQueen or Mater. First of all, the ones that I was sent from Cookies Kids doesn't even have Lightning McQueen on them, they have Frightening McMean and then on the other two pair there is a space ship looking thing and under it, it says ""Mator,"" no I am not misspelling how it is spelled on the underwear. I am so disappointed in this and then to go to their website to have them returned and they say that they don't return underwear. I spent $10.00 on this and am very mad! Don't buy these!!!"
4,Boys Underwear,"The underwear is fine. If your child likes the movie cars, they will like these. I just didn't appreciate paying almost the same in shipping as the item cost. In addition the item was very light, it couldn't have cost that much to ship."
3,Title is a bit confusing..,"I bought this thinking it was a 2 3-pk (so 6 in all) but once it arrived found out that it was actually just one 3-pk (3 in all). It is actually ""Cars 2"" 3-pk, not ""Cars"" 2 3-pk.."
5,I highly recommend this book!,I used this book during my first year of law school and it provided me with great legal writing skills. My summer employers found my writing easy to understand and well-formatted. I still defer my legal writing questions to the book in my upper-level law courses.
1,Attrocious - both the book and Amazon,I find it interesting that somewhere around a dozen extraordinarily negative reviews by various law students have been deleted.
5,Official publication date is not the date of first use...,"Professor Murray has been drafting this book since the beginning of his career in academia at St. Louis University. He taught with his book and other published texts for my 1L Legal Research & Writing class while there, and I found it to be far more readable and coherent than the published texts that were also required reading. Though I can't speak to the current version, I did use his unique alternative to IRAC and had many supervising attorneys pleased with my legal writing."
1,Huge Waste of Money,"If you're looking for a legal writing resource, look elsewhere. This book is poorly written, overly vague, and chockfull of typos. Even the layout is awful. Seriously, did they write this book in word? Overall, this book states the obvious and really doesn't tell the reader anything the didn't already know."
5,It one of my favorites,I love this book and have made the quilts time after time. I do think the seams in the star points get bulkey so I trim away the excess fabric even though it's not described in the book. Its a must have if you like or love little quilts.
3,Nice quilt book,"This is a nice quilt book with good instructions and lots of pictures. I did find however that after the first few pages you were looking at the same quilts over and over, only done in different colour schemes. There are still some excellent patterns and instructions. This book is very inspiring as well. Any room filled up with that many quilts is bound to feel at home."
5,little quilts : all through the house,my book was lost in the mail but I was given a full refund with no questions asked. Everyone was so nice and I was even given a free book for all the trouble!! Will buy from this seller every chance I get!! Wonderful people.
4,"Good-looking, few pockets","I've had this backpack for about a year. It's held up very well; I use it frequently every day, and it looks like new. The red color is bold and looks nice. My only disappointment is the small number of pockets. The smaller pocket, in the front, is somewhat too large for keys, pens/pencils, and change, which tend to become swallowed in it. The only other pocket is very large, and works well to hold books, sweatshirts, etc."
1,NOT LEATHER,"This review is for the Pomegranate Frank Lloyd Wright Leather Sketchbook. I am SO disappointed with this item. It is described as a ""leather slipcase"", and when it arrived I was happy to see the design of the book was exactly what I expected, however as I continued to examine the item it became abundantly clear that the leather was in fact some kind of ""naugahyde"", vinyl, or other faux leather. This is VERY disappointing. I was really looking forward to using this book and now I have to send it back. Props to Amazon for making the process simple, however I would really rather have the true leather slipcase that I was expecting. It's lovely, but it's not leather. :("
3,Solid but unspectacular,"Gene Tunney was a very unlucky heavyweight champion, he was born with good looks, intelligence and excellent boxing ability but came at a time when he would have to meet and beat (twice!) a living legend in the form of Jack Dempsey. The public would not forget the taming of the Manassa Mauler by Tunney.The book is well written but a touch bland, as if the author did minimal research except go through the books about the time and quote passages. There seemed to be little new material uncovered.I would have liked more about Tunney as a man, what did he do once he left boxing? Was he successful, if so, how?"
3,"Short, but sweet","Although short, I enjoyed this book. It was fast-paced and kept my attention. I felt so bad for Baby Boy, but the Davis brothers got their revenge. Somewhat predictable, but enjoyable at best."
5,SOME FAM DOES STICK TOGETHER~,Y'ALL I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU BOUT THE BOOK BEST BELIEVE IT A MUST READ....AND THAT THESE BROTHERS DO THE DAYUM THING FO'REAL NOIRE YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME WITH YOUR WRITING THE HOOK UP WITH 50. IT AMAZING HOW YOU COME UP WITH THESE STORIES........BUT BABY BROTHER IS OFF THE METER AND YA'LL MISSING OUT IF YOU DON'T READ IT. CAN'T WAIT FOR SOME MORE.THANX NOIRE & 5O
4,Pretty Good,"This book is a fast read. I read the book in a few hours. I thought it was a great read too! While some of the parts were a little far-fetched (the war at the end), most of it was well-written and totally believable. These brothers were serious about getting their revenge. Nice collaboration with 50 Cent - I wasn't sure if I would like this one or not. It turned out to be a great buy!"
3,amazingly written. the point is clear for anyone to see,"the story was rushed a little. however the unexpected death in the middle really threw the story out in a good way. the idea that everything in your life can change and the love of family was the biggest message and most affective. overall the book delievered a good message that alot of people can relate, empathize, nd learn from."
2,Eight is enough is more like it!,"I would first like to start by saying, ""What Happened."" I loved all three of Noire's other books however this book was a total blur. It had a decent plot, no rising action, a predictable climax, and a twisted ending. It would have been wise to concentrate on one or two characters. However, this books was maybe 300 pages but had like 20 different characters. Prince is the only artist that I know who has the ability to drop new material every three monthes. Word to the wise Noire, ""All money ain't good money."" In other words, putting 50 Cent's name on a book doesn't mean anything to an intellect. 50 cent can afford to flop he's rich, however you are not established yet."
2,Not Impressed!,"Ok, I understand that this is a NOVELLA and not a NOVEL and Novella's are shorter than novels but, Garbage is Garbage no matter what size bag its in! I'am a Noire fan really I'am, I've read everything else she has written and loved it all! But this Noire and 50 collabo? Oh Hell Nall! I don't know if it's because of 50 influence but I din't care for this book at all! If this is how G Unit books will be I'll pass great authors or not I Want My Money Back Damnit! Noire, I'm looking foward to ""Thong on Fire"" and all the author books from you but please leave G Unit books alone! PLEASE!"
2,Baby Brother,It was truly not one of her best books. G-Spot was the best and Candy Licker was just a carbon copy. But I know she got skills so keep doing your thing
3,Baby Brother,"Read ""Baby Brother"" if you enjoy quick and straight to the point plots. Its filled with suspense and action packed."
2,Staying 1 Step ahead!!,Ok I havent even read this book yet and I am sort of afraid to spend my money and be left dissappointed. Mainly because I've read Death before Dishoner by 50 and Nikki Turner and that one was awful plus the reviews on this book is so bad as well. 50 need to find something else to do because if he keeps this up he is going ruin alot of talented authors careers!!
1,Trashy,"I am a high school English teacher and I picked this book up on the bargain shelf on my way through the check out line. The cover looked interesting and seeing that 50 Cent wrote it, I thought it would be a good book to add to my repertoire for reluctant readers. I was excited thinking I had really ran across something that my teen students would gobble up. I realized after reading the first 3 pages, which describes in much detail the main character having sex with his girlfriend, that this book wasn't going to fly. AFter reading a few more pages, the language and content aren't something that I would want my students to be exposed to. My instincts were right, it would probably keep the interest of reluctant readers, but for the wrong reasons. It is like a trashy Harlequin novel for teens."
3,fair porn,"This is a collection of old vintage gay porn. Much of it is old and washed out, difficult to see. It is interesting though, to see guys who were natural, not these fake twinks like they have now. This is good old fashion porn with gay guys who knew they were gay."
3,A good fantasy romance,"I have read a lot of Connie Mason books, most are good. In this book the capture scenes are a little to much, I mean who in their right minds would allow themselves to be taken that many times, but of course this is fiction. Overall this is a interesting book. The plots are good, and of course you've got plenty of sex scenes, as with most of her books, but all in all it makes for a good fantasy reading book. At least her heros ,adn heroins are strong figures, most of the time. I enjoyed and will buy more."
2,Are you kidding me?,Quite possibly the worst I have ever read! The excessive use of corny sexual terms is laughable! Not to mention the authors obvious love for the word 'virile' is just too much for me. This author and book are a waste of my time and are undeserving of being on my kindle.
1,silly!,"Did I read the same book as the other reviewers?This book read like a ""mockumentary"" or I guess I could be nice and call it satire."
2,Bummler.,"EARLY MAN contains some nice fuzzy guitar work and is produced by ex-HUM frontman MATT TALBOT, but that can't save it from some drowning due to horrible vocals. Sounds like the singer has a mouth full o' cotton balls. The lyrics are indecipherable because the poor vox sound emoted from an actual EARLY MAN. Avoidable."
3,BEWARE - NOT THE REAL ALBUM!,This cd has different songs and from different/ later years than the original Shake Some Action. The songs on this cd are the first 14 songs listed on CD 1 under the two cd set Shake Some Action Live With The Flamin Groovies on the Dressed To Kill label listed and reviewed elswhere on Amazon. This song list was evidently made to promote a tour of Australia and totally different than the original song list and date of recording. Go to Amazon UK to see the song list of this cd. Too bad Amazon US didn't as I would not have bought this.
1,BEWARE - Terrible Sound,the AIM version of this great album is a MAJOR RIP-OFF!!! the sound is dreadful. it's a disgrace they put out something so crappy. save your money and get the Complete Sire Recordings.
3,A product of its time,"A better, and I should guess best, biography of Sibyl Hathaway was written some years later by the dame herself and which I commend to those who have an interest in this arcane ""last feudal state of Europe."" It too is entitled DAME OF SARK. The most enchanting piece ever written about her is in the chapter on Sark from John Sack's 1957(?) classic REPORT FROM PRACTICALLY NOWHERE."
3,What the heck?,"Nice shirt and is true to size, but different Logo on shirt! Great thickness so I won't be returning it."
1,Review,"This DVD is three movies: Hitler's SS: portrait of evil, black brigade, and minesweeper. I thought this would be more of a documentary but it isn't. It is a collection of three very bad, forgotten WWII movies. It is not worth buying even for die hard WWII collectors. It looks like something you picked up at a dollar store."
4,The music in this CD is fresh and well-composed,"For those who have followed Soda Stereo's musical career, this CD was surprisingly innovated. The change of musical style is truly different from previous released records. Still, Soda keeps its basic structure of well-written lyrics, which supports an excellent music."
5,Muy adelantado a su época!!!!,"Definitivamente un disco muy elaborado, saliendo cuando apenas el ""grunge"" daba sus primeros pasos. Lo considero el mejor disco de Soda, aunque ""Signos"" es muy bueno. Mejores canciones: Claroscuro, Secuencia inicial y Primavera cero."
5,Mejor Trabajo de Soda,"Entiendo es el disco de Soda que menos copias vendio, pero es el mejor de Soda. Dynamo salio a la venta cuando el grunge apenas estaba comenzando. Toma la ruta, fue y claroscuro,mejores tracks del album, de cierta manera me alegra que no se haya sido tan popular y haya quedado como el disco culto de Soda entre sus seguidores."
5,Underrated Excellence,"This is one of Soda's most underappreciated works, but it shouldn't be overlooked. ""Dynamo"" shows the evolution of a band in top musical form."
5,soda is great,"I love the early work of Soda Stereo, and I must say Dynamo is different. In my opinion you either love it, or hate it. In my case, I sure love it. I love the work Cerati is doing now, and I still love all of Soda. Listen to it w/ an open mind, and you will know what I mean."
4,Tables!,"I recently purchased the round tables for my classroom. They are wonderful, and allow several of my students and me to sit around them all at the same time. They are also extremely lightweight, allowing me to move them when an activity requires extra floor space."
2,Good for beginners,"This book is just a repeat of all other books on Natural Magic. I found it to be boring. However, if you have never read anything on Natural Magic before then this would be a great book for you."
4,Let the good times roll!,"When you pop this cd into your stereo you don't have to worry about pressing ""skip"" since all the songs here are great and listeneable! Collecting hits from late '97 to early '98 artists included are Ricky Martin, Spice girls, All saints, Chumbawamba, Janet Jackson, Hanson, Boyzone, Backstreet boys. Back then when pop music was not as bad as today because honestly I would rather go back to that time!"
4,Beautiful dancers - but not as good as Waterdance,"Had I not seen Waterdance first, this book would have been a number 1 for photography of dancers. I'm a fan of the human body, and this book shows it beautifully. While excellent, it leaves me wishing for that something more, that something that exists in Waterdance. I'm thrilled to see that Schatz has continued the water photography in Pool of Light - can't wait for it to be delivered. - Sam Hunter"
5,"Terrific movie, lots of history behind it","This was a wonderful movie, esp for a fan of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. Holmes is shown as a very sympathetic charactor, more human than the original stories show. Well worth the time to watch and don't miss the deleted scenes; the story behind how sections came to be deleted (check IMDB or similar source) adds alot to the story of the film and of Wilder, the writer/director."
4,Wilder's Sherlock Mystery...,"Wilder spices up the personality of Sherlock Holmes as the master detective enters another remarkable journey into the world of mystery and crime. It all begins with a beautiful lady who appears out of nowhere at Holmes' front door, and it seems as if she suffers from amnesia and a lost husband. However, these mysteries are old news for a genius such as Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson. Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is an interesting film, but the overall picture lacks the usual spice that Wilder used to combine into his creations."
2,Not you're average holmes....,"Is Holmes gay? That's the first thing addressed in this movie. Fans of Sherlock Holmes will be dissapointed with this rendition of the famous detective. Though his performance is bearable, it's not faithfull to the character. Even less is the portrail of Dr. Watson as a hotheaded and sour man, who gets so flustered with holmes he almsot attacks him. totally out of bounds!The plot it'self is rather conveluted, and mundane, and in the end nothing exciting happens after everything they built up. The first 30 mins of the story is unrelated to the next hour and a half save for establishing that holmes doesn't like women. Which is suppose to shock you as he semi-falls in love with the female protagonist.A boring movie with more of a spoof of holmes than an actual rendition of the character. Don't waste your time."
4,Holmes fans will enjoy,Few projects reviving Sherlock are worth their salt (nothing is as good as the 6 BBC shows) but this comes close.
3,Just okay.,"I like mysteries, especially detective stories. This movie was just okay; I was never captivated. I would recommend it if you are bored and can't think of anything better to do."
5,Watch the Special Features too,Billy Wilder had a wonderful vision for his original production - so much was lost - but what is left just shines - The best Sherlock Holmes film ever
4,Holmes Fans only,"These are for the Holmes fans- like me- the stories are similar to the many other Holmes stories - but as a fan and collector, I had to have it"
4,The Basis of the Film,"Having not yet seen the DVD I have, however, seen the film on its first theatrical release (double billed with MCKenna's Gold). Most folks reviewing the film mention Miklos Rozsa's fine score. Few realize that Billy Wilder based the plot ideas for the film on the Miklos Rozsa Violin Concerto and that Rozsa adapted the Concerto themes to form the basis for the score. Find the 1955 Jascha Heifeitz recording on RCA (available on CD)or look for the 6 minutes adapted Fantasy recorded by Rozsa. If ever there was music to inspire a Sherlock Holmes story this is it."
5,A Magic Editiom,"A delicate film from a genius. A film made at the time wrong, a time were the shout was valid more - the 70 decade. With absolutely fantastic extras. One film a would be more consistent with the inclusion of cut scenes and the shortening of determined scenes. A simple edition problem... In this time, the characterization of Sherlock Holmes like a dandi addict in cocaine she was courageous. And the end is absolutely sensible... A little jewell."
1,Very disappointed,"When writing, it felt 'extremely gritty'. It was not fluid at all. Not that this is the most expensive pen in the world, but for the price, one would expect a smooth writing experience."
4,Excellent compilation of philosophical/economic thought,"An excellent alternative to the nonsense offered by liberals and conservatives (and moderates, and socialists, and greens, and reds, and libertarians for that matter). Among the highlights are Harry Binswanger's excellent ""'Buy American' is Un-American,"" along with articles addressing such perennially-hot issues as immigration, socialized medicine, etc. Great book. Don't miss it!"
1,"The cover says ""by Ayn Rand"" but very little is by her.","There are 2 essays by Rand, and 14 by other writers. Someone needs to review her concept of secondhandedness."
1,Its not by Ayn Rand!,"The front cover says ""by Ayn Rand"" but look at inside -- most of the essays are not by her. I think she called this secondhandedness."
4,3 wire is better,this servo is roughly the equivalent of a tower pro sg90 el cheapo servo. the losi 5 wire servo drops right into a 2.4ghz board made by losi or their 27mhz one. this servo fits into the 1/36 and 1/24 models. i suggest investing in the 3 wire servo and upgrading your electronics whenever possible.
3,Tight,"This is the first playa fly cd i got, its pretty tight, too many skits... but the freestyles werre nice, sap sucka explains the reason why i got into playa fly. bill chill lives is the tightest track on here, the hook is..amazing. i look forward to coppin some of his old stuff."
5,Wit and Wisdom,"""Wit and Wisdom of the American Presidents"" is an outstanding collection of sayings of the Presidents through the ages and is excellent for public speakers and writers who quote the writings of famous people to establish their points."
2,Ridiculously Skewed to the Left,"Before one even opens up this book, one can sense an inherent bias: on the cover of the book are nine universally recognized great Presidents (Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Lincoln, Grant, both Roosevelts, Truman, Kennedy)...and one other, namely Barack Obama. No Ronald Reagan, no Eisenhower, no Calvin Coolidge to counteract such Leftism...not even James Madison. And then when one opens the book, one can see that George Bush was hardly quoted at all, despite serving two full terms, while once again, Barack Obama is quoted extensively, despite him barely even getting into the White House when this book was published. I guess the Left never, ever stops their brainwashing efforts, not even for one moment."
5,Not what I was expecting,"Based on an interview I heard with the author on NPR, I expected the book to be a quirky comic romp about a Southern family. While the book seems to start out that way, it completely turns on you and becomes much more. More than any other author I've read recently, Melanie Sumner completely understands the mother-child relationship in America. In the relationship between Louise and her mother, I see almost every mother I have ever met. The extremeness of Louise Peppers' rebellion may seem like it comes out of left field as one reviewer noted. On closer inspection, however, it's a rebellion like many teenagers have experienced. Louise doesn't know why she does what she does - she just does it because she's a teenager and hasn't figured anything out yet. I would recommend this to any parent having a hard time coping with an unruly teenager and any teenager who feels chafed by their parents but doesn't quite know why."
2,A promising start...but ultimately disappointing,"This novel begins as a charming tale of a neurotic Southern family as seen by the young protagonist, a quirky young woman ill at ease in her surroundings. Then, midstream, the narrative abruptly changes and begins detailing the protagonist's self-destructive behavior, ultimately culminating in a poorly conceived trip to join the circus. The writing throughout is strong, but I wish the author had stuck with the original plotline, without devolving into a _White Oleander_-esque parade of horribles."
1,Think about it for a second...,"This book was not engrossing at all. It was descriptive in the uninteresting parts and too quick in gliding over the parts that needed more explanation.But the worst part of it all is explaining to another person what the book is about. So, half the book is about a girl, her odd family, and the way she encounters religion. Suddenly, her brother dies. She ends up working in the cardboard factory with her father and starts dating a 30-something year old. The parents find out and she's shipped off to college where she stays for about two pages before running away to the circus. She wants to become a clown and is sleeping with the fire-breather. They decide to get married, but the fire-breather doesn't appear. Turns out he's been sleeping with the gay clown behind her back.At this point, I had to close the book. No more pain and agony from this book for me."
3,same as anyother,This moth product it wasn't any better or worse than any other moth products I've used. I would not purchase again.
2,URINAL CAKE SMELL,"I didn't see anyone describe the smell quite so accurately before buying, so I will. If you've ever smelled those cakes that people used to hang around the toilet bowl in the 70s and 80s, this will totally take you back in time. The tin has two cakes that actually look crystal-like, and are probably the exact same thing. I just hung the tin up in my closet against hope because I have a serious moth problem and my expensive clothing is getting ruined. However, if that men's urinal smell takes over my room I'm gonna dump it out."
1,Returning this without using it,"I have no idea if this actually works because I won't open packages. The bottom of the can clearly states: ""This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer."" Didn't see that reference on the website product description or I obviously wouldn't have purchased it."
3,hella 550 kit,I recently purchased these and did not open them up until a few days after I recieved the package. The light bulbs are missing. I have looked all over and cannot seem to find any link to conatct the seller. I threw out the shipping carton and it is not worth my time or money to go out and purchase an appropriate box so I can return. What the heck am I supposed to do here? Makes me wish I had purchased from a direct vendor as opposed to amazon.
2,Covers a few basics ...,"Actually I'd give it 2.5 starsNot quite the depth that you'd anticipate from the title. Just gives some broad concepts in connection with the so-called house church movement or ""cell groups"""
4,Set Apart from the Rest,"Why Small Groups?If you are already familiar with Sovereign Grace Ministries then the tone of this book will not surprise you. This book was given to me by an official in our denominations district office and once I read it I purchased one for each of the Elders in my church. One of the strengths is it stays away from all the oft-repeated ""how-to's"" of small groups. It is a guide directed toward the biblical basis of why a church does small groups. The title is an accurate description--it is not about how, it is about why. If you are involved in the leadership of small groups (or are thinking about it) I would highly recommend ""Why Small Groups?"""
1,Hard to finish it!,"I expected this to be a chronological autobiography. This book jumps all over the place and it is hard to follow from chapter to chapter. I did not enjoy it, but I forced myself to finish it anyhow, but it was not an enjoyable read."
1,Truly bad,"Not only is Conroy a woman hater, he also cannnot write worth a dime. Much of his work is nonsense,badly written, trite and boring. Use this as scrap paper!"
4,Sympatico - Tom Freund,Tom Freund is a very talented musician - he's a bass player and a good song writer. He has an understated voice but I like it. It's kind of nasally but I dig it. It's very mellow and definitely grows on you.The music on Sympatico is very laid back and cool music. It's sort of rootsy pop with a lot of jazz influences. I love when Tom throws in the jazz instruments for added background sounds. It's too bad Tom is relatively unknown. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of his releases.
3,Not so bad,"I am truelly sorry for the other reviewer, but this album isn't that bad really, it's just not so good.The songs are nice, but a little bit annoying sometimes.not bad and not good."
1,Forget about it.,"The pump that arrived was not as pictured, but that didn't matter to me as long as the GPH was correct. I used it in a very small fountain and it didn't pump water any faster than my old pump that was only 75 gph. After working for less than a day, it finally...ran...down...to.....a trickle. So I returned it."
1,Two Times a Dud,"I ordered the Beckett 130gph auto off fountain pump. It arrived on time and as described. I placed it in the fountain, plugged it in, and....... nothing. I gave it a little shake, heard a faint grinding noise and that was it. I boxed it up and exchanged it for a second one of the same make. Amazon's return policy made it easy to exchange! I got the second pump in a matter of days. I again placed the pump in the fountain and this time was excited to see that it pumped. But, alas, my excitement was quickly dashed away when the pump stopped after a mere 3 seconds. But then, all of a sudden it started pumping after nothing for about 2 seconds. It repeated this pattern, 3 seconds on, 2 off, for bit before stopping completely. I am returning the second pump tomorrow and am currently looking for another brand of pump. My advice, stay away from Beckett's pumps."
3,What you order is NOT what you get,"Beckett 7091510 130gph Fountain PumpI ordered the Beckett pump specifically for two reasons--my past experience with Beckett pumps is that they are very reliable and also, this relatively low volume pump had a 15 foot cord which was exactly what I needed. To my dismay, when I received the pump, it only had a 6 foot cord. Reading other/previous reviews, I noted that another customer had made the same complaint previously. Guess I learned two things---read reviews in advance and do not necessarily believe the detailed description placed in the ad. for this to have happened to one customer is understandable--mistakes happen. However--when it happens to more than one customer over a period of time, it tells me that Pricebully does NOT consider customer feedback and attempt to avoid the same mistake down the road. Leif Grytebust"
4,pump for fountain,Works exactly like it's supposed to. Shipping was fast and I am very happy that it fit where it was supposed to and works accordingly
5,Excellent product great seller,"The pump arrived on time since seller delivered promptly.I'm using it on a pondless fountain I built on my front yard and it has worked perfectly since (1 month ago).It's a great buy for the price and I would absolutely recommend both the seller and the product.When I purchased it, the product description said 15' power cord which is not right (it's 6'). I contacted the seller so they address this issue.Other than that, the product is excellent."
4,for fountain,"bought this pump to replace weak factory pump that came with fountain purchase.this pump works great, much quieter and has a strong steady stream. no problemswith it so far."
3,Early Modern England,"The work is well written [ a bit more details than usually required ] .......my version, much underlined by a previous reader............and lacked, in some respects, a narrative storyline. A good and important accompaniment for the Great Courses course of the same name!"
3,"Penelope, yes! This film, not so much.","Penelope is all that people say she is in this movie. But it's really, truly, not among Almodovar's finest. Compared to ""Talk to Her"" or ""All About My Mother,"" or ""Bad Education,"" or others, this is really a kind of slow, second-rate film. If you love to luxuriate in Penelope Cruz's allures--her impossibly huge eyes, luscious hair, bouncy, ivory skin--then by all means, watch it. But go to Almodovar's other films for a complete cinematic package."
4,Volver,"VOLVER is a good movie, but not your typical Pedro Almodovar film. The film has exceptional performances especially by Oscar-nominated Penelope Cruz & Almodovar regular, Carmen Maura. The film seems pure and unoriginal compared to other Almodovar cult classics like MATADOR, TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN, ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, TALK TO HER, and BAD EDUCATION, but its still worthwhile similar to WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN."
2,Uninvolving,"We are not meant to take the story seriously, so we don't. Then what remains? The notion that women share a special bond that men can never understand, because men are lying, shiftless, drunken, cheating, incestuous, pedophilic rapists. Some interesting glimpses of Spanish village life. And Penelope Cruz, warm and gorgeous, who almost makes the film worth watching."
3,"Great actresses, dull movie","I may not be really qualified to review this film, which I attended with the missus. I slept through almost all of it. Apparently I didn't miss much other than Cruz singing. I had fairly guessed all the major plot issues 20 minutes in. The popcorn was awful also.What I do remember though, is that the actresses were all quite beliveable. Cruz radiates like Sophia Loren - unlike every American [..], like say Anniston, Cruz is actually believable in a role as a working woman. The trouble with this film is that you expect certain very odd plot twists with Almodovar, so it becomes quite easy to guess where this is going once the tableaux is set.I'll stick with TALK TO HER. There was everything to love about that film. As for this, well..... I had a great nap."
2,Disturbing,It is too dirty to show in my classroom. I was looking for a good movie in Spanish with a good plot that would be suitable to show to high school students. They are extremely hard to find.
5,Volver lives up to Oscar Hype!,"I loved this movie. All the female stars are excellent. It was hard to know if it was a ghost story or real. The director is always great with the way he tells stories from a women's point of view. This film was even better than his classic, ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."" I highly recommend this film! Cruz shines!"
4,terrific or horrific? - spoiler alert,"I am amazed at the emotions that this movie has elicited from the viewers, considering the horror being portrayed. A young teenager has to kill her father in self-defense and later we learn that she is a product of incest, her mother's sister and daughter at once. Is it really funny? is it a movie about love? or is it about the ordinariness of dispicable behavior and our ability not to see it when presented as a matter of fact. People, wake up from admiring Cruz's cleavage and charm and consider what her character was through!"
5,One of my Fave Movies ever,"IMHO, this is the best film Almodovar has made yet. It has all his typical quirks, beautiful colors, and a sense of being very truly Spanish. However, the acting my Cruz in this piece is tour-de-force. I find her so beautiful in this piece, despite the ""blue-collar"" character she plays. Really five stars in my book."
4,Great Great movie,"Memorable lines, memorable characters and a certain magic only Almodóvar can bring...This is a great movie in the true style of Almodóvar films. Penélope Cruz powerfully acts the character of Raimunda and shines doing so. This powerful cast of women act with the poignant entonation that is reminiscent of theater (with their strong and paused acting perfectly queued to deliver the perfect lines) but with the allure and aesthetics of film. The actress that played the daughter is not as good though: a little bland or jaded. This is defiantely a movie to see."
4,Visually stunning drama about motherly love,"Volver is a twistedly moving tale of disturbing family secrets and reconnecting love between mothers and daughters. This emotionally charged contemporary ghost story (or is it?) weaves in and out of standard reality and a heightened version of reality that exists only in the filmmaker's mind. Each frame is clearly painstakingly prepared, resulting in a visually stimulating and colorful film.I had my doubts, but Penelope Cruz delivers a performance well worth her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is also solid, each with their own nuances and subtleties.What's most surprising is the comedic flair that bleeds through some of the most dramatic scenes. These moments help keep Volver afloat and stop it from dragging down into heavy melodrama.The extras include interviews with several cast members, as well as Pedro Almodovar, the director. There's also the special feature staple: feature commentary, and a making of featurette."
4,"Women, Supporting Each Other","""Volver"" is the story of Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and her relationships principally with the women in her life including her sister Sole (Lola Duenas), her teen daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo), what she initially believes is the memory of her mother, and her friend Augustina.The character of Agustina (Blanca Portillo) was my favorite. I couldn't take my eyes off this woman and her amazing performance of this traumatized, noble character bearing a terrible tale and honoring her friendships. Such expressive, sad eyes. And she loved her women. ""It's our business.""This is a story about women; the men in the movie are either icky (Paco, Raimunda's husband) or fleetingly present. And these women are strong, flawed, and interesting. ""Don't tell me because it will make me cry, and ghosts don't cry."""
1,"Boring, tired Euro-Feminism","Booooring.I lived in Europe for a number of years and speak foreign languages. I like ""challenging"" foreign movies from Europe. I found this one a total dud, and completely boring. Women sitting around in Spain, comforting each other, and how bad men are, etc.I am just glad I don't live in Spain and would have to support this from my taxmoney, as - unlike here in the U.S. - they don't fund their movies privately, but they take it out of your paycheck if you live there. (one of the reasons I moved back to the U.S. from Europe)."
5,Muy agradable,"I thought this film was very provocative and honest from the director's standpoint, and entertaining. Excellent acting from Penelope Cruz and the entire cast."
5,Great Tool Box,This is a great tool kit for little hands. The tools are sturdy and will hold up well even to rough play. I remember having a set of these tools when I was little. The handles are small enough that young children can easily hold onto them.
4,Great mini tool kit,This has been a favorite toy for both of my sons. 5 1/2 and 2 1/2 years old. The tool box takes some hard licks but it is a great size and easy to carry around. The screwdriver always disappear in our house but the rest of the tools are lots of fun for the boys.
5,Dead On Target!,"As a fire fighter who has been part of many weapons of mass destruction drills with a large metropolitan fire department, I can tell you that this film portrays a dirty bomb explosion and its aftermath exactly as it would actually happen. It's frightening!It is a very well made film. The charaters are well played, interesting and believable. The plot moves along at a good pace and is accurate and riveting.I can't exactly call it ""entertaining"" because of the subject matter, but it is indeed a film every American should see. This is far scarier than any horror flick I've ever seen..... This could actually happen as portrayed...."
3,realistic,"As a student of Counter terrorism this movie hit a lot of items I have studied. Realism is in this movie, however to those not interested in the subject it does not have the ""action"" that many expect.Dirty War"
4,Great Educational Material,"Excellent movie showing a possible real-world CBRNE response to a terrorist event, and the intelligence community efforts to try and prevent it and secondary events from happening. Not a lot of special effects and no one will win an Oscar for their performances, but it doesn't need ""Hollywood"" to grab your attention. Ideal for people who train in this sort of thing to see possibilities of what a real world event would be like."
5,Dirty War is a very realistic scenario and also sobering.,"I was actually amazed that HBO would address this subject in such a reasonable fashion. If people want to know the threats that are just beyond our obvious perception and how to react, then this is the movie to watch."
5,Dirty War is realistic portrayal,"Dirty War subtly depicts the delicate balance any government would face between attempts to prepare versus reality - you can't be fully prepared for something like a dirty bomb exploding in a major city. The mass decontamination scene was fairly accurate (your birthday suit and a fire hose; some people not hearing about no eating drinking or smoking until after decon too late) as was the training exercise and the reality gap beweeen the prime minister (local government)and the fire department. For use to depict to non-professional emergency responder personnel the overall complexities and harsh reality being faced daily by government and firefighters/paramedics/etc., this is an excellent movie. It ends with saying how many thousands of years it would be before that section of London would be inhabitable - a sobering thought."
4,"Great Manual, but be careful w/it.",Great Manual. Very detailed. Take specs lightly though. It told me to put 42psi in my back tire which ultimatly caused me to wreck my bike. Rest of the manual is great though!
2,Dont,"Oh my God dont buy this if you are looking for a RECORDING mixer. this is for like live shows or something i dont know. those effects they brag about, yeah well they dont shut off so if you want to record something you have to deal with the effects which sucks if you just want a clean channel."
1,They should list the CFM at PSI,Sounds good I did a little research and found out its Air consumption: 7.0 to 9.0 CFM. But the manufacture still didn't state at what PSI.
1,WARNING TCP GLOBAL - HORRIBLE SERVICE,"I ORDERED A DIFFERENT GUN SET FROM TCP GLOBAL, ATD-6900, INSTEAD THEY SENT ME THIS ITEM. GOOD LUCK GETTING A HOLD OF SOMEONE TO EXCHANGE...CLASSIC BAIT AND SWITCH. THEY WON'T EXCHANGE IT!!!!"
3,Not a Bad Little Handbook,"For young people or those new to the Catholic faith. This book is clear, concise, and easy to read. It is an excellent introduction to Catholic theology, designed for membership training.I didn't give it five stars because there was nothing in the book that was new to me. If you are interested in knowing more about the Catholic church I suggest that you purchase an actual Catholic Catechism rather than the simplified, condensed version."
4,whoa,First I'd like to say to that one reviewer ....K-os sounds nothing like Magoo....how could you disrespect Kos like that ???? Now to the album I gave it 4 stars because there are like 2 songs that I have to be in the mood to hear ...you feel me you can't give an album 5 stars if you don't like every single song ....I love this cd it's just great ...I like the mix of R.A.P(rhythm and poetry) and roots Raggae it's perfect espically with his voice and his insight ....his Rhymes are flawless and on point . His production is damn near perfect and he has a message that he's not forcing on you ..nor is he making the the bling bling heads feel uncomfortable with his songs ..this album is for anybody and everybody who wants to listen ...great buy
5,The Song just hit me one day.,"I was watching the video for Superstarr part Zero and wasn't really paying too much attention to it. Then the song popped up in my head randomly. All I remembered was the song had a chorus like this, ""You can't change the world, You're a Superstar"". So I did a search on Yahoo for the song at work and soon found out it was a guy by the name of K-Os. Cool!!!! I went and purchased the CD the same day!! I must say it's a BREATH of FRESH AIR to Hip Hop. In a time where outstanding artist like Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Wu Tang Clan are overlooked by mediocre artist like Eminem, 50 Cents, Jay-Z, Nelly and Ja'Rule we need more and more artist like this. I'm impressed with K-Os' overall musical talent and the fact that there are NO Curse words is awesome IMO. I'm a 22 year old straight male who doesn't curse at all and for a Hip Hop artist to release a track without any cursing is impressive!! Support this Artist!!! K-OS is on my highly recommended list."
3,DVD-R Warning,"Just Understand, this is a DVD-R production with pretty poor quality video -- the text blocks (silent-movie type scenes) are badly cropped, etc. It may be a fascinating film (I haven't watched the whole thing yet), but don't expect ""remastered"" quality by any stretch of the imagination."
3,I Did Not Imagine,"I Did Not Imagine that my DVD video would come as it did. The transfer was obviously completed by an amateur working with Nero and some other program to create the DVD jacket cover that was apparently created with a screenshot. I have seen worse quality of transfers concerning image clarity, but my biggest grip would be the poor work with the aspect ratio where you can clearly see that the top and bottom of the image is cut short, since care was not given in this area.As far as the story goes, I think it is a great sci-fi/musical classical movie that all film noir fans will enjoy."
2,Better than nothing,"This is a great and hard to see film and I have been trying to get a good copy of it for decades. This review is not about the film, it is about the product. I had a VHS copy taken off the TV and missing the last thirty seconds, so this DVD is technically an improvement. That being said, the quality sucks big time. I don't regret the purchase and hopefully you won't either, but it is far from the presentation this film deserves. It looks like it was shot off of a dupe of a dupe of a scratchy 16 MM print. If this is the best quality available then Just Imagine is one step away from being a lost film. I'm happy enough to have this DVD, but I hope somewhere, someone has a good print that can be the basis of a remastered version someday. This will have to stand in for it until then."
3,Just Imagine,"If you are expecting some dramatic, imaginative and real futuristic masterpiece, this is not for you. If you are a devotee of early American camp musicals with poor songs, 'understated' acting and very simplistic comedy this is your thing. As for the assumption of some intelligent space-fiction story line don't look too deep, if at all.. Some of the ideas of the future are interesting but VERY undeveloped it is all (intended?) to be very much taken with a very large pinch of salt (I hope!). Enjoy as a film after a late night out, preferably with all critical senses switched off!"
2,i've read better...,i've read over 100 outlines in this vien. go to fortbethel.com under books 4 much better guides. this guide's just plain boring
5,Best Book Ever,"This just has be the best book ever, I ordered mine from amazon.co.uk & recieved it yesterday Wednesday, it's brill, I do have the other Friends books that have been published over the last few years, but nothing will ever beat the newest one, well done to David Wild Author of Friends Til the end"
3,"A nice way to say goodbye, but gets redundant","I loved the photos and all, but the interviewer asked each of the cast member EXACTLY the same questions, and by the end of the book, it seemed like I was reading the same information over and over again. I think it would have been more enjoyable if each star had answered questions personal to their own experiences."
5,Wonderful,"This was an awesome book that any Friends lover would love to have in their collection. I loved reading every bit of it and had it read in a few days if that long. Very interesting stuff in there. We have all 10 seasons and watch them quite often. We will never get sick of watching, learning about or hearing about our FRIENDS!!!"
3,lacks both theoretical depth and vivid real world cases,"This book doesn't have a lot of real world business cases, a little bit boring. On the other hand, it doesn't have much theoretical depth either. As a practioner, I didn't find much useful info. inside."
5,fun purse book,"This is a great little book to pass the time anywhere! I keep it in my purse for those waits at the doctor's office, airport, wherever! The facts in this publication are so much fun to read and to share and they make great cocktail party conversation!"
5,great - this works actually! thanks!,This item works really well - was surprised by it -- but it worked great! I plan on using it on a lot more trips
4,Four airline trips with no problems.,"Although not a scientific study, after wearing this product on four airline trips in the space of two months, I had no respiratory problems. On the prior four trips, I developed a respiratory infection each time. It is easy to use and I would recommend giving it a try if you have had bad luck with airline cabin air."
2,"not sure its effective, makes a high pitched whine",The high pitched whine this makes is very annoying. I couldn't stand it for more than about 10 minutes.
4,airlines don't allow lithium batteries,"The air purifer worked great; it really kept the colds away on airplanes. My first one lasted over 10 years. The second lasted 5 years. But in the last 4 years, airlines would not allow the device because of the CR123 lithium batteries. Air Canada flight attendants must confiscate the device; they treated me like a terrorist. They finally consented to just take the lithium battery away from me. I told Wein Co. about this, but they never replied. For the last 4 years I had the product, I had to sneak while using it on planes, clipping it to my waist, so flight attendants couldn't see it. My next air purifier will not use CR123 lithium batteries."
1,Personal Air Supply,"Well, it didn't work, at all. Didn't turn on. Nothing. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to see if it was just a bad battery they shipped to me or the whole thing, and I've probably missed my return window, so there's $90 down the drain."
4,Looks awesome!!,Although Amazon states this will not fit a Jeep Commander with the 3.7 V6 it will. According to K&N;'s website this is the one that is recommended for this or the 05-10 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the 3.7 V6.This CAI looks great in my Jeep. I have noticed an increase in torque but have not felt any horsepower gains. Couple this with a cat-back exhaust and it will get your V6 breathing and sounding much better.As another user stated the instructions are quite poor. Because of this it will take a novice mechanic about an hour and a half to install. A great tip would be to install the brackets and saddle on the heat shield the night before you plan on installing. Then all you would need to do is remove the old air box and install this one.
4,Sweet story and realistic.,This is a sweet story about a family that experiences financial troubles. I actually purchased and used it to help my high school students with inferencing - it worked well.
5,Tight Times,I ordered this book for a lesson about inferencing. It worked out well. The book is older but timely.
5,A Complex Look at Culture and History in Socialist Czechoslovakia,"A great and brilliantly subtle film. This is a turbulent and complex essay on local vs elite culture, on urban vs rural life styles, on utopian ideals vs difficult realities. It was made in the sixties as the satellite countries began to push for atonomy from a bureaucratic and repressive soviet system.But it speaks to everyone in its portrayal of the role of art and beauty in the lives of common people.DeeDee Halleck"
1,Incredibly boring,"I picked one at random. I like Gottschalk so I bought all 8. This is the most dreary, tedious, SLOW, boring bunch of garbage I ever listened to. No one would believe for a minute all the tales of Gottschalk's virtuosity and popularity from listening to this. Show me a tempo faster than a ""tune"" by Wagner and I'll genuflect to it!"
1,The film has been transferred at the wrong speed,"As soon as I started playing the DVD I knew that something was terribly wrong. A quick comparison with my CD set of the soundtrack, and other recordings of 'Otello', confirmed my fear: the film has been transferred at a slower frame rate than was originally intended, and thus everything sounds lower than the correct pitch.MGM DVD gets zero stars for an unforgivable error."
4,"Fabulous cast, horrible cuts","Domingo's Otello would justify seeing even if Britney Spears and Groucho Marx took Desdemona and Iago. He's at his peak here, and his thrilling, passionate, and tremendously powerful voice is astounding. Ricciarelli is no less impressive as Desdemona, whose silvery tone makes on think of Kiri te Kanawa. Justino Diaz as Iago . . . well, the voice isn't quite Milnes or Gobbi, but his acting was impressive and his voice was acceptable. Zeffirelli's directing was great, but the cuts are UNacceptable. ""Fuoco di gioia,"" most of Act 3's finale, the opening of Act 2 (""Non ti crucciar"")and, most shockingly, the Willow Song!!!!!!! Great film and cast, but hear an uncut one first."
3,Good but not perfect,"Zeffirelli`s version of Otello is first of all a splendid orgy of beautiful pictures. Sadly, it cuts a lot of Verdi`s gorgeous music (e.g. Desdemona`s Willow song)while the rest is admittedly very well made. If you want to indulge in oriental atmosphere then this video is an excellent choice. But if you want to enjoy Verdi in the first place at least listen to the full-version soundtrack afterwards."
1,What? No Willow Song? No Ave Maria?,"How could they cut the gorgeous Salce and Ave Maria? I can only speculate that Ricciarelli couldn't manage the lower tones of this ""Zwischenfach"" role."
3,Just buy the paint.,The POR-15 paint itself is beautiful stuff. I used it to black out the rims and various rusted parts on my old Harley motorbike. But the only useful item is the POR-15 paint. The rest of the kit us useless. It would be really nice if they switched to plastic paint containers like Sherwin Williams uses. Once you open the can the lid gets so gunked up you are unlikely to be able to use it or open it again.
3,GOGO Golf Tees,"OK, but come apart after 18-20 holes. Done, complete over, over, over, over, over. Can't say anymore. Done, done, done!"
3,cooking,"have an oven that's too hot for temp shown, this is doing the job so far. Note product is made in China, so I'm going to see how it lasts. Size is nice and very visible."
3,"Good thermometer, but ...","Good thermometer, but i don't see the numbers when is inside the oven. Including when the light inside the oven is on."
2,Does not read correct temperature,"I bake a lot so I have at least 2 oven thermometers in the oven at any given time, I also use an instant read thermometer. I bought this thermometer because of the big numbers, I wanted something I could just look through the oven window and know the temperature without having to bend down or get a small flashlight to read the numbers. This thermometer was constantly 50 degrees or more off every time and I have used it every day since I bought it. I have never seen an oven thermometer so off before so I would not recommend this item even though I love the big numbers."
2,Get it right next time Amazon!,"I just received my item. One reason I purchased it was because Amazon states ""dishwasher safe"". So it just arrives and the back of the packaging states ""do not put into dishwasher"". I'm not real happy right now as I actually purchased two to use in my commercial smoker. These will most likely be blackened after the first use. Bottom line is I rated it 2 stars because of Amazon's lack of attention to detail, I actually haven't even opened the packaging yet to be able to rate the product."
3,It died?,"I bought this oven thermometer because it was cheap enough and had a lot of good reviews. Unfortunately, after a couple months of living in my oven, it just kind of...died? I found that no matter how hot my oven got, the dial never went higher than 400 degrees. Then one day, the dial went all the way over to 45o degrees and stayed there. Even when I put the thermometer in the freezer, it still read 450.Not sure what happened, and I'm not sure if this was my fault or the thermometer's, but I'll be buying a different oven thermometer from now on."
3,"Accurate enough, Easy to get water in","Pros:* Decently sized dial* Hook design is simple and easy to hang on your oven rack* Tested it in my toaster oven and it matched the dial temp (eventually) most of the timeCons:* Got water in it fairly easily so be careful when washing it. Most of the water dripped back out and the rest evaporated by leaving it in the oven at 300 for a few minutes.* Response time is not the fastest. In my toaster oven it gets to the dial's temperature eventually, ~30 or more seconds after the toaster's heating element has cut off.I wish it would cost a couple bucks less than $15, since there are other oven thermometers with equal Amazon rating that cost less."
2,do not recommend,"Due to a filmy residue that formed inside the glass, my thermometer is unreadable after two-and-a-half years of use. It seemed to work alright initially, but now the needle is stuck at 375 degrees. Its price today is twice the amount I paid in May 2010."
1,Accurate but hard to read after the dial scratches the numbers,"UPDATED REVIEW FEB 2013 1/5 stars:My thermometer needle has ceased to move because it has scratched a divot in the face (around 250 degrees) and has become embedded in it. It was very accurate while it lasted. This thermometer was never put under severe circumstances. Never dropped, smashed, or mistreated. It ceased to work properly on its own after normal use in my oven. I do not consider the life of the thermometer to justify the cost of the device.ORIGINAL REVIEW 3/5 stars:This oven thermometer scratched itself after only 2 uses in my oven. (See picture above) The numbers 300, 350, and 400 are being worn away with each use in the oven.Pros:AccurateEasy to read (when it has not scratched itself!)SturdyCons:Defective dial scratches the temperature indicatorThe notch on the top of the thermometer is too small to be placed on my standard oven racks. I have to set it on a rack and sometimes that is very inconvenient due to lack of space."
3,Only worked a few times,"A few times after I started using this product, the indicator stopped dropping below 100. Not sure of its accuracy anymore."
1,Worked once; then no more,"Despite all the good reviews, mine lasted through one turkey roasting. After that, I could see that the seal was broken, moisture was on the dial, and the pointer was stuck on 425. Never moved thereafter."
4,Good Thermometer,"I've had this thermometer for about a month and I am really pleased with it. The numbers are easy to read at a glance and I trust the accuracy of the temperature readings.My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is that the stand for setting the thermometer on the oven rack is flimsy and the thermometer often falls off the rack with the slightest touch. This is probably because I have an old oven with very thick oven racks, so it's not a major flaw, but it can be annoying."
1,I think it worked once.,"I used it successfully (?) once. The second time it froze at 450 degrees. I even put it in the refrigerator hoping to unfreeze it. For $15, I expected more. Since I've thrown away all the packaging material, can I still return it? What do I need to do?"
4,It works reasonably well and is readable,"It works reasonably well and is readable, which is important to me. Seems to be accurate for now, I would rather pay a little more and have more assurance that the reading is write"
3,For the old oven,"We like this okay. Its somewhat accurate, but I think the big problem is the hook needs to be a little bit larger"
5,Love This Rain Gauge!,We received this rain gauge as a Christmas gift last year and love it! Both of us are getting older along with our eyes so the large numbers and bright-red float make it easier to read even from a distance. Our gauge is about 30 feet from our kitchen window and we have no trouble reading it clearly.If you enjoy weather watching this is a great place to start and would be a wonderful gift for young and old.
4,Wonderful science teaching tool for kids!,"I bought this as a christmas gift for an adult friend and he was thrilled with it, then my nephew saw it ,he's 11, and he wanted one too, so I bought him one. The numbers are large and very easy to see from a distance and surprisingly very accurate! It's a great tool for a child developing a weather hobby. It's also very sturdy for the price you pay and it would be good for students wanting to do a science project."
5,Great easy to read rain gauge.,"This rain gauge is a replacement for one that was old and broken. This is a nice easy to read gauge. It is exactly like the old one I had to replace, and have had for several years."
5,Adequate,"Adequate because it holds up to 5 inches, and here in the Sierra Nevada foothills we can get that much in 24 hours. It's on a post about 30 feet from a window and I can read it clearly when my glasses are clean. I had a 4"" version of this very model but lost part of it when we moved here but that one was at least 10 years old and looked as good as new. Well; almost. Close enough anyway. So I assume this one will last at least another generation."
2,raingauge,"This rain gauge is not of the quality of the previous gage I had.It is not a jumbo rain gauge as shown on amazon, it is much smaller than the jumbo I had. The size of the gauge in height and the material made out of."
3,Rain Gage,Did not ship screws so that the gage could be mounted. I will be very easy to read once I find screws so that I can place it outside.
5,great one,"i like rockstopper, better than this one, but i think thats only because i haven't really been in the right mood to give this one the correct chance. I ii iii ii i um.. yeah this is a great album. i cant think of anything to put. i'm so dense. tigerbeat6 fanboi right here."
2,Tsubo Review,"Maybe because the sizing is over seas, but these shoes were too small for me, not comfortable, I was very disappointed. Returned not exchanged because I would try shoes on first."
2,Call me Crazy Crazy,"Okay, my sister and I love horse movies, horse books, and of course, real horses, so please do not bad mouth me because I rate this so low. I read the Saddle Club books, and I recommend those to everyone, but this Mane Event, totally not what I expected. It seems like the girls are more into...boys than horses. I like the other movies, though I'm not really wild about them. This movie is not something I would recommend to horse crazy girls."
5,horse crazzzzzy lover!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is great i watch the show and sing the songs visist the website and read the books i have a bunch of horses myself so this helps me with my vocab and also helps me come up with a solution if anything like this ever happened to my horses i highly recomend this movie
4,Well worth a listen,"If you enjoyed the soundtrack to this unusually, intelligent fast paced thriller then you'll appreciate this overdue CD which develops the short musical interludes from the film into extended pieces. High octane 1980s electronica is mixed with thoughtful sublime orchestral pieces, overall making for an enjoyable nostalgic experience."
4,My Introduction To The Groovies,"I remember reading a review of this in Hit Parader back in '79 when it was first released;it was not a totally positive review,attacking them for doing one too many covers (but that's part of what they do and they pick great stuff),however the concept of the group was enticing enough for me to want to seek them out.Although this isn't their finest record and I'm more into the Roy Loney era than the Chris White/Cyril Jordan stuff,Jumpin' In The Night is a true rock n' roll album that I have a special fondness for. The originals are great,especially the title cut,and ""First Plane Home"", as well as ""Next One Cryin'"",all Groovies at their best.The only mistake is a lame version of ""Werewolves Of London"" ,also pretty out of character for them to record what was then a recent song."
1,Misleading information on amazon,"The original book, although impossible to find is a stellar resource to have and I highly recommend it. However, the version on Amazon is a photocopy of the original and the histopathology slides and information is useluess when the copy is viewed due to loss of detail. Buyer beware."
5,precise and remarkable; shape and form is astounding,an amazing book; the photography is superb in capturing the essence of architecture
2,A Couple of Seconds Worth of Sounds Each,"The CD has multiple sounds but only for a couple seconds each. I was hoping to desensitize my horse to different noises but the noises are not long enough or the quality is a little ""off"". This CD would be great for a student needing quick sound effects for a class movie project, game, home video. :o)"
5,du Maurier,"I have read most of her novels & I cannot recommend her works highly enough. What a gift she had. That the LORD would give such gifts to men is marvelous, & all to the praise of His most glorious mercy & goodness."
2,Written in autopilot,"Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of ""drove there-wore this-ate that"" sequences that leave us wanting.Stephen Cannel plus clothing descriptions."
3,Twisted: A disappointment,"For the first time ever I was disappointed in a Jonathon Kellerman book, and I think I've read them all.Twisted is about as believable as Alice in Wonderland but is missing the charm of the White Rabbit and other assorted creatures that people that book.Not only is the plot far-fetched but the characters seem to be dedicated to placing themselves in ever more dangerous situations without plausible reason. Thumbs down on this one!!"
1,Not for me this time,"I am suprised to read so many good reviews as I did not like this book at all. I am a big J. Kellerman fan and had to struggle my way though this book. The story it self was ok (not more then that) but the sex did not add anything to the story. I have nothing against sex scenes in a story but this time it bothered me. But the main issue that wanted me to put this book down is the inwoven politics. Please spare me the Israeli issue, I live there, I live it, I don't want to read about it. Specially not about ""the storie's hero happen to be on the place who saves lives at a suicide bomber attac."" That's why I stopped reading Faye Kellerman's stories. Kellerman is good because he is a psycologist himself, he knows what he is writing about but should leave out the politics (if you can call it that)."
3,Audio Book Warning,"The writing isn't bad, but the audio book features Lindsay Crouse -- she's a TERRIBLE narrator. I love her as an actress, but she should STAY AWAY from audio books! She rarely changes her inflection, and freqently it's hard to follow the story. I've listened to so many wonderful books, where the readers gave life to the characters. Sorry to say, but Lindsay sucks the life out of them."
2,Horrible narration! Story just okay.,"I am avid listener of audio books, and I thoroughly enjoy when a narrator interprets the story and characters dynamically -- bringing the characters to life. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this audio recording. This was the worst audio book by far that I have ever heard! Ms Crouse, the narrator, uses the most boring, monotonous inflection imaginable. Every sentence has the exact same ominous-sounding, Dragnet-style tone, regardless of whether she is reading something about a suspected murderer, or the characters' discussions over dinner, or bedroom love-making! It was absolutely dreadful narration.As for the story itself, which was tedious listening due to the abysmal performance by the narrator, it was not very exciting to me. I figured out the killer before the characters did. The romance between the protagonist and her strange boyfriend was tepid and awkward.I was glad to be finished with this audiobook!"
2,The killer was revealed a mile ahead.,"Or maybe two miles, I'm not sure. Interesting characters weakened by a bare plot."
2,"Sloggish, Boring, and trite","Not a very good book on any level. Not horrific, but overall really lame. A whodunit that you could never predict, because there was nothing to predict. It's like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it, chose a character at random that 'did it' and wrote the last 10 pages. So save yourself some time, read the last few pages and make up your own adventure."
2,Where did the villain come from??,"Am I the only one who read this book?? The Killer's identity is revealed only in the last 20 pages or so. There were no clues prior to that as to his identity, except for the existence of a chat room - out of left field. And why didn't the librarian get more credit in the end in solving the crime? Also, there was no connection between the drive-by murders and the serial killings. What a long book to slog through, for such a disappointing ending!!"
5,Book Purchase,"My experience in purchasing the book ""Twisted"" by Jonathan Kellerman lived up to all my expectations. The book arrived on time and was in mint condition.The process of buying on line was very easyThe book has been a very good read.Thanks for prompt service, Amazon"
4,Good,"It took me a few tries but once I got into it, I really enjoyed it. I am a superfan of Alex Delaware series so I was resistant to a new series but I am glad I gave it a second chance!"
2,I don't think Jonathon Kellerman wrote this book,"The choice of words and tempo are not what J Kellerman usually writes. The characters don't feel as real. Petra is one of the few female characters, but the writing feels feminine. Anyway, pass on this one. It may be one of the growing number of books where a famous author just lends his name to the work."
2,Not as Expected,"Book was intact but has like coffee stains (not as described).It's a shelf reference book, so not a big deal."
3,Dr.T's DT364 Snake away granules,"I think the snakes left from around the house, but the smell seeped in the the house and last over a week"
2,If you can stand the smell of strong moth balls,"The product does work, but only for certain snakes. The deal breaker for me is that it gives off a very strong smell of mothballs. Mothballs themselves would probably work if you ground them up. They cost more than the Snake Away. We unknowingly put it where the fumes could get into the house via the air handler and it was pretty awful until the stuff wore off.So, if you have a problem with the strong smell of mothballs, then you need to find another way to control the snakes."
3,No wonder they stay away,"The snakes love our pool. I have had 6 or so in the pool. I started using Snake Away about 2 years ago and it seems to help with the snake problem. Good News - 1) No more snakes in our pool and 2) It does not kill the snake - just keeps them away. Bad News - 1) you do have to re-apply every 3-4 weeks or after a heavy rain 2) The smell is awful (strong moth ball smell) - no wonder the snakes stay away. The smell does get better over time, but for the 1st day or two after use, the snakes aren't the other thing that won't go in the pool as my son and his friends refuse to go in while the smell is at it's strongest. I think its worth it!"
4,Mr. T's products are very effective,"I've used Mr. T's pest control products for years, and they are very effective. Just a note that the picture shows a hard plastic container, but I received a soft bag of granules instead. Not a big deal, but I'd prefer the container in the photo since it's easier to store. This product does not repel all snakes, and as someone else said, reading the instructions is crucial to its success."
5,Works great!,I have put this stuff out behind my back fence and have not had any rattlesnakes in my yard since! It smells strongly of mothballs the first couple days but then it dissapates. I buy this and out it out all summer long.
4,uno de los mejores,"He escuchado un ""casette"" de Hecho en Puerto Rico que compre hace mucho, sin duda, uno de los mejores que tengo para escuchar y traer memorias de la isla, por eso compre un nuevo CD, para segir escuchando por mucho mas tiempo."
4,Disco refescante,"Para los fanaticos de la musica de Willie, esta grabación fue una refescante. Toca temas sociales de los latinos."
5,cute,"Product arrived in a timely manner. The horns were in perfect shape, looked great, and are cute on the dog. They stay on well."
4,Possibly the best science fiction novel ever written.,"Lem borrows deftly from the languages of medicine,mythology, physics, and engineering in weaving aspellbinding tale of earnest but fallible mentravelling to a distant planet. As the titlesuggests, things go wrong with alarming and oftencomical regularity; Lem simply refuses to take forgranted some utopian future in which everything--machines, ideas--work flawlessly. Compared to hisAmerican counterparts, Lem strikes one as decidedly""old school:"" how many works of this categoryportray with sympathy and understanding a soldieror a Catholic priest? The style is surprisinglypolished considering the spotty quality of some ofLem's other endeavors. A book of philosophicaldebate as well as an adventure story, but withoutthe benefit of character development, it almostqualifies as literature, and it is quite possiblythe best science fiction novel ever written."
4,DO NOT READ THE BACK COVER!,"DO NOT READ THE BACK COVER!Like the best, this isn't much of a science-fiction story. The aliens are interesting and the technobabble convolutions amuse, but the real reason to read this story is that it gets crazy. And as the characters become more and more morbidly insane, you go right along with them."
2,DVD not book & wrong author,"This is a ""Film by Dan Burke"". It is not a book by Gregory Penniston. I have not opened the DVD. I am 1 month later still trying to return it."
1,Misleading By-Line,"This CD-ROM is not produced by the Federal Government. Hence, the by-line should not be U.S. Federal Government. This book simply borrows -- 'rips-off'is a better word - FREE materials of the Federal Government and compiled them into a CD-ROM. In fact, what you will see in the CD-ROM are EXACT pages of various federal-owned web sites, such as the Small Business Administration.Instead of buying the CD-ROM, simply go to the various government sites such as SBA.gov and CFDA.gov."
1,Disappointing,"The CDROM is essentially a dump of the information found on government websites such as SBA, SEC, etc.The information is voluminous so if you have a slow modem, there may be some value in purchasing the info on the CDROM for the sake of having it consolidated in one place. You will learn little new if you have already been to the websites.Also, some of the links on the CDROM do not work properly. You open the page in Adobe Acrobat and receive and error message saying the page has to be opened in a browser. You open the page in a browser and you get a message saying the page has to be opened in Adobe Acrobat.That kind of foolishness more or less sums up the value of the CDROM from my perspective."
1,Pointless,Save yourself a lot of money and time ... just visit your local NonProfit Resource Center. These CD's are direct burns from government websites with a cheap case and covers. I got them and returned them the same day.
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware! This CD does not contain the original artists performing these songs! They are very good facsimiles and I had to listen closely but they are imposters. I'll have to say that the person singing ""as"" Howard Jones does a good job, nonetheless."
1,Stop! Go Read A Book,"We need a 0 star rating. The people at the Masters Record Label should be ashamed of themselves. This is clearly a case of misdirection. Yes, these are the original artists but nowhere near the original versions or versions even close to resembling them. Obviously they did not have the rights to the original recordings (read:no $$$) so they must have found recordings that were made at a different time. And club mixes...? Puh-leeze... Take a crap recording and play it over a casio keyboard and this is their idea of a club mix? An insult to the artists' fans and fans of the genre in general. I guess legally, they actually didn't claim they were original, but they didn't warn you that they weren't, either. Don't bother with this one. Do something more worthwhile instead. Read a book.... even the phone book."
3,Average book that could have been better,"I owned this book briefly and am relying on memory, but since there's only a couple of short reviews here, I wanted to add one also. First, the book is a good size hardcover with lovely illustrations. Very nice to look at, but I did not like the fact that there are very few poems included. In each section for each poet, there are only a couple poems and these are in large print. The main focus of the book is the pictures with just a smattering of poetry. It's more of a coffee table type book of poetry. More poems (and poets) would have made this a much better book and why not add more? There are plenty to choose from!"
1,Reporting From Ramallah,Poorly connected review of the uprisings and occupation from 1997 - 1002. Fragmented reading with no obvious direction.
5,Excellent Quality!,"The picture really doesn't to the product justice. Looks much better in person, and I was surprised by the quality when I got it. Nice solid backplate, and made from sturdy tetron material. Pleates/creases are very clean and looks like it will last a very long time as long as you care for it properly. Customer service (Koby Shimada) was very helpful in finding the proper size. Very, very, very happy with this purchase."
2,Another LARGE scale map,"This map was almost worthless for walking around in MP and Cusco. It might be helpful for touring by car or bus from town to town in the Sacred Valley, but for pedestrians, it was of no value to us."
3,Not too happy about this,I found this product to be so greasy that I only could stand using it once. I wish I could return it. It was quite expensive.
3,Maybe just for Garbo fans,"This is a pretty average melodrama that I found a little dull and lifeless, despite the ""exotic"" locale and star power. Frankly, I don't think the Garbo ""mystique"" holds up so well over the decades, and she doesn't add anything special to this ""weepie"", as they use to call them. Herbert Marshall is past his prime as the substantial but boring husband, and so is his acting style. George Brent as tall, dark, and handsome is... forgettable, as he was in so many of the Bette Davis flicks.The familiar plot of a woman torn between an exciting lover and a ""good"" husband; and the consequences and heartbreak wrought by her infidelity needs stronger performances to make this story more interesting or engaging.I just saw ""Now, Voyager"" and I would recommend that film as a far better example of the genre. I am not even a Bette Davis fan, but her personality and mannerisms seem much more genuine and accessible to contemporary tastes than Garbo's. I give The Painted Veil 2 1/2 stars."
2,Complicated footwork turned me off,"Love Cathe but this one is just not for me. The complex step choreography left me extremely frustrated -- I spent half the time just watching the TV screen, completely lost! And Cathe was cuing AS she does the moves, which didn't help. I simply couldn't keep up. Give me a straightforward, athletic workout where I don't have to learn a whole lot of fancy footwork, and I'm happy. That being said, if you're experienced with step workouts or you're very coordinated, then this might be for you. It looks intense & challenging. Beginners and people with two left feet: keep looking."
5,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!",Cardio & Weights is my favorite Cathe's DVD. The music is uplifting and the routine is plain fun!! It's also doable as I believe is only 50 min. long. This is more of an intermediate workout. Cathe does cycles of cardio using the step and also weights. I have so much fun with this workout!!Imax 2 is also Excellent. This is a cardio workout that consists of 10 intervals. Now this DVD is TOUGH... it will definitely test your cardio capacity. Some of the step routines are pretty advanced. I love doing IMAX2 on Saturday mornings when I well rested :)Cathe definitely puts together the BEST workout DVDs. I've been doing her DVDs for about 2 months and I'm seeing GREAT results!!! If you want results then Cathe is for you!!
3,"Good, but not great","This device is useful for presentation to some extent. It allows the user to go back and forth between powerpoint slides, and to hide the slides. RF communication means you don't have to point the remote to the receiver to change slides. Another cool thing is that you can store the receiver inside the remote. But the device does NOT have a laser point built-in (yeah, sometimes, even Amazon has wrong description) and that is WHY the battery will last over a year. By the way, it uses a flat lithium battery (similar to the ones used in watches). Overall, a good product, but not great since it doesn't have a built-in laser pointer."
4,Slight problem,"...my 90-year old aunt who received this as a GIFT from me, got confused when she saw the billing slip enclosed and sent in ANOTHER payment.I called the Goodwill people, explained my aunt's confusion and asked them to return her check or not cash it.I just spoke to my aunt in California, and they wrote her a note thanking her for her ""donation.""I am disappointed that in a way they got two payments for the book, rather than responding to my phone request. Yes, I did speak to someone on the staff (rather than leave a message).Shipping was fast; book was excellent! Double payment was definitely NOt their fault...but they should have contacted one of us, since I informed them of the double payment."
3,Stylishness is Necks to Godliness,"The Necks new album ""Athenaeum, Homebush, Quay & Raab"" is a 4 cd pack including 4 X 50mins (approx.)live sets. I have owned ""Hanging Gardens"" and ""Sex"" for a few years and have enjoyed theme immensely. This new album is a lot more relaxed and slower than those two albums. In their usual highly progressive and seductive manner The Necks offer a quality pack that will grow and grown on you. If this is a first time Necks purchase for you, i would reccomend starting with either ""sex"" or ""hanging Gardens"" first. However, if you are a seasoned fan then this is a must have. It may seem pricy but for over 3 hours of music it aint too bad."
5,Hear it new.,"I do not want to take too much time with this... but this collection of live recordings is a whole new way to hear the trio play. On the albums the studio and the process are present... live you hear only the three players interact and hear the bass, piano, and drums fill a room. They are a band with a particular mode...that is for sure... on this live recording you can hear that it holds up without technology."
5,Great book (from an African American woman)!,"This book opened my eyes to all the compromises I was making because of my race in spite of my spirituality. I, too, strive to be a 24-7 Christian. More Christian than African American. I highly recommend this book to people of all races."
5,"Compeling, thought provoking, and spiritually rich","This is a powerful personal narrative about the spiritual journey of an intelligent, young African American woman. It dares to raise questions about the intersection of culture and faith. The author challenges readers to identify the priorities in their lives and place the faith commitment above all else. This is a must read for Christians of all races and ethnicities but it speaks most powerfully to African Americans who feel ""caught"" between who they are and ""whose"" they are. Bravo to Kimberly Cash Tate."
5,I was very inspired and moved by this book.,"This book was a testament to how God works in our lives and to how if we will surrender our wills to His, then He will transform us into the people He wants us to be. As a black female attorney, I was particularly interested in Ms. Tate's story because it could have been my story or that of several of my friends. I have already recommended the book to several people and I will continue to do so. The book also challenges us to look beyond what we have been taught as far as God and race are concerned and it makes us realize that we must serve Him first and not follow the crowd just because those in the crowd may look like us. I have also learned that I should not be so concerned with what the messenger looks like as long as he or she is bringing a message to me from God and His word."
1,This book is awful and a waste of money.,"This book is awful and a complete waste of money. The title is misleading. Thebook is completely and utterly vapid. I am an African-American Christian woman in Ms. Cash Tate's age group and was looking forward to reading her story. She is obviously a very accomplished woman. I was interested in reading about her spiritual journey and how she balanced her life and cultural identity. The substance of the book has little to do with the title and her accounts of her life are superficial. I was disappointed that she used a controversial title to generate interest in a book that is little more than journal entries or musings of her life. It has been a long time since I have read such an irrelevant, uninteresting book. I was so dissatisfied with this book that I requested a refund."
5,Brief Description,"This album is G-Dub's best work. It is written with passion, spirituality and a humanistic view. People will be able to feel his soul and relate to his music. It's destined to change the industry."
3,Difficult to Find Your Item,"While the book is huge and covers a vast number of items, I have yet to find an item in it that I need to identify/value. It's a good resource for a general feel of how to price items/what items should cost. I tend to rely on more specialized/collector's books instead of this one. In fact, I don't believe that I have opened this book in a year."
1,1 Star is 1 Star too many.,"Even though this arrived in perfectly undamaged packaging, the table top had an ENORMOUS gouge across it that looked like someone'd lost control of their Dremel grinder. And since the packaging was fine (even that thin, gauzy plastic covering the piece) that means it left the factory in that condition. I thought I'd assemble it anyway. Just for kicks. The screws aren't quite long enough to use the washers and still be able to catch the wood. The cabinets doors aren't wide enough to cover the cabinet opening - there's about a half ince gap there - and one door is warped or something so it doesn't stay closed anyway. This worthless contraption could never have sold for the $350+ stated original price. Save yourself the trouble."
1,It's bubble gum,If I could write word over I would.. It's just gum and what more can you say.. It's what I ordered so I'm happy with it.
1,i've had better,dubble bubble has to be the worst buble gum ever invented. the moment you pop it in you mouth you can already taste the awful after-taste. and this crap is most rubbery than anything else.
4,A little difficult for our 4 year old,"The game has lovely graphics, and creative-educational games. My son enjoys matching the poop with the correct farm animal. However, it is a little difficult for him to understand what the directions are or what he's supposed to be doing in the game. It's a bit ""word heavy"" for a boy who has an auditory processing disorder, but he does enjoy clicking on the animals to see if they'll poop. In fact, anything to do with poop will entertain him. It's really better geared towards older kids and younger children who can handle higher level learning."
5,best tea ever,Twinings tea is the best bag tea on the market today. I like orange pekoe tea. This tea has a natural sweetness and a beautiful ricj brown color. Alltea is a great company with a fantastic customer service policy. They want you to be happy with their product.
5,Silent film fans MUST have this book!,"Kevin Brownlow has written THE definitive and loving tome on silent films. An informative, well-researched, and entertaining book, this is an essential must for every afficiando of the silver screen. The only competition of this caliber is Walter Kerr's ""The Silent Clowns"". It is a shame that silents are overlooked by the majority of the public----this book will enlighten and make you hungry to view the films discussed.Dave Gersztyn"
5,The Parade's Gone By,"Such a fascinating book! So many photos and so much information. Published in 1968, Mr. Brownlow has included interviews with early film stars and directors. If you are interested in early films, as I am, this is a great book for your library."
1,SERIOUSLY INCOMPLETE,"THIS BOOK DOES NOT EVEN MENTION CLARA BOW, ALONG WITH GRETA GARBO, THE GREATEST ACTRESS OF THE SILENT FILM ERA, AND ONE OF OUR GREATEST EVER. BUY SOMETHING ELSE OR YOU ARE BEING SERIOUSLY MISLED BY THE DIRECTION THE AUTHOR TAKES."
5,Subshine for my sunshine,"Bought this large, fun mug for my young son who loves The Beatles & especially the ""Yellow Submarine"" movie & music. His eyes lit up when I gave this to him as a gift. I adore the bright, colorful design - especially the inside that reminds us ""love is all you need"". As a previous reviewer remarked, there were no warnings about the paint/glaze on this being harmful. We use the really nice box it came in to house some of my son's little trinkets.Two thumbs way up!"
5,Rue is great!,"I love all the movies in this series. Rue is wonderful and I also loved her in ""The Golden Girls""."
4,Good gun but.......,"The Good: it's fun, it has good range, it has good accuracy with the right BB's, even though it says blow back it does not have kick back, it's not heavy, the full auto, it does have the power to knock a pop can down, it's battery powered,The Bad: it's magazine only holds 15 BB's, you can't buy any more magazines, it deflects a lot, it jams a lot, it's a battery sucker,Tips: if it jams put it on auto and and pull the trigger not enough to fire and it will unjam and then put it back on semi, you should use 6mm .12 gram BB's, buy the Crosman Gel target trap, buy a lot of BB's"
3,ehhh......,"Its an excellent gun, notice i said gun. The clip only holds frekaing 15 shots so automatic feature is pointless. to this day ( 2 months after buying) im still looking for spare clips. It shoots hard and rarely jams. When it jams with semi just put it on auto and let it fire a couple of times. Good gun but the clips have of it so 3/5. Dont reccomend buying unless you can find spare clips for it too, unless you are a good speed loader."
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought this gun and loaded it after one shot spring shot out the front of gun. Complete junk!
3,Crossman Pulse P70,"The accuracy is not real good and it doesn't shoot real hard. The overall quality is not great. It tends to jam on semi auto, so just use full auto. Full auto has a slow rate of fire. Also, you only get 15 shots and I can't find extra magazines anywhere.All that aside, they are fun to shoot I bought my brother two so he could duel wield them and it is fun. They are good for close range indoor matches."
5,thanks,Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks againThanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again
2,You get what you pay for,"Considering I bought this strap for next to nothing, I can't complain too much. However, what I will say is that it has a very cheap feel throughout, especially the paper thin ends. My main problem with it was that the string for the head/neck end of the guitar was stretchy and literally looked as though it would break if I put any weight on it. Oh well though, like I said. I bought this for almost nothing. Much better if your guitar has two buttons so you needn't use the string"
4,good item,"This item seems considerably better than the popular jj cole. For one, it seems like a much higher quality and warmer. the only drawback is that the only way to use it properly is by removing the belts from the carrier and stringing it through the holes whereas the jj cole has flaps with velcro for easy installaton. I bought it from babyage for 50$ so it wasn't much more expensive than the jj cole, but i think the regular price is more like 75$"
3,"Love the book and the tune, but...","I love the book and the words, the music, but i don't feel they fit together well. I can't seem to get them to line up no matter how hard i try. I would love to watch a video on how to sing this book. There should be a video on the web somewhere, when i find one i'm sure i'll change my rating to 5 stars."
5,Little Boy Lovebug!,I seldom see books that extole the wonders of having a lovely little boy. My grandson's are so precious and we love reading this book.
5,Could have been written by MY heart,"I found this book in a store while shopping with my infant son and my mother over 3 years ago. My eyes were watering by page 2 and I was crying by page 5. When I got to the ""hole in my heart"" I had a lump in my throat and couldn't read any more. I had all but given up on ever having kids and then found out I was pregnant, the hole in my heart was very real and was filled by my boy. And my son LOVES the book. First it was the lights and music but now that he is almost 4 he is starting to really understand the message and really likes that too. The person that said that it was a negative book was way off!! This book is all about the most powerful love that exists on earth - the unconditional love that parents have for their kids. And it is a message beautifully written in a book that will be cherished for a lifetime. I am glad to see that there is a book for girls too."
2,Just okay,I bought this book after buying and loving the author's other book (You're my little love bug). I guess I had higher expectations for this one and was dissapointed. This book is no where near as good as the Love Bug one. It's not horrible but there are better books out there.
4,cute book,"My 20 month old loves this book. The song is very soft and soothing and while we read it to him, he continually presses the button on the heart to keep the song going. Its very cute, but it seems to be for single kids. There should be a version for more than one child. I know there is a version girls too, but again, a single girl. Its still a nice book and a good way to tell you child how much you love them with a little background music playing. The book claim to give you free batteries for life, but you have to pay shipping and handling which turns out to be the same price as buying a 10 pack on amazon...the one they would send you is a six pack, so I just bought the batteries here instead of getting the ""free"" ones for 3.99."
1,"Bad for kids, bad for parents","This book carries the misguided message that a parent's happiness and self-worth is derived from treating their children as the possessions that define their own lives. Every other page of the book is filled with the tearful faces of parents living without children, complete with unhappy faces plastered about the sky.Not only is the imagery unpleasant, but it is downright scary for young children to see broken homes and upset parents. Furthermore, it reinforces a highly co-dependent way of living.It does not surprise me that the author of this book has 10 children, with every intention to keep adopting more. It's clear that she feels the same way as the parents in the book: her life is defined solely by children, and she may be lacking in a well-defined sense of self. Watching her children mature to become independent adults may leave her with a hole in her heart, as the book's verses suggest, because she has not taken the time to know herself beyond her role as parent."
4,Looking Up,"Screenplay and TV writing is something I would like to do, maybe on my bucket list. In my humble and unlearned opinion of this field of writing, I believe this book gives a nuts and bolts direction for that goal. I would recommend it to anyone who is seriously considering writing bestselling true crime and suspense."
2,They Omitted the Negro Spiritual by Jennifer Bynum,"Why on earth doesn't the soundtrack contain the Negro Spiritual: ""Change Mah Name"" or ""Changed Muh Name""by Jennifer Bynum [Green]. She performs the song in a pivotal moment in the film and merges, with excellence, an operatic element that is sheerly captivating. They are wholly remiss in not compiling this soundtrack differently, so as to inconspicuously admit this into the body of music offered on the CD.Valentine Nwanze"
2,Very disappointed,"""Change Mah Name"" was not included on the CD. The song strongly influenced the audience as well as the character, DJ. I would have bought the CD just for that song. Shame on whomever decided against including it."
5,Makes your head bounce.,"If you enjoy hip hop music you will enjoy this CD. Each artist has to be creative in their very own way. Without judgement let us reward the creativity that was put into developing this work of art. Great CD. Please listen to it. Listen to the art, the art of someone's acheivements. Not words, that these artists only use to describe a time in history that these things may have occured. Great job!"
5,Wonderful depth and description,"This is one of the better books I've read this year.It's the story of Sara Livingston (born on a Saturday and ""working for her living""), a single mother determined to keep her heart under lock and key. Hardened by love affairs gone bad and family and financial struggles, it isn't until she meets her ""knight in shining armour"" that Sara begins to let down her guard. She discovers that she must learn to open her heart and mind to the idea of being in love again.Sloan's prose is full of description to the point that you feel like you are sitting in the room with the characters, enduring their tribulation and triumph, and feeling their emotions - love, pain, grief, and, most importantly, healing.The novel deals with myriad issues, from sibling rivalry to bedroom antics to domestic violence. Filled with plot twists and turns, this book will keep you up until the wee hours, hoping to gain closure for ""Saturday's Child."""
3,I'm Glad It's Over!!!,"I'm SERIOUSLY giving these ""reviews"" a side eye. This story was BORING. The main character whined about her life and love. She was a bitchy nobody that happen to get lucky and marry a man with a little bit of money. I have no idea how this book received good reviews!!!Trust me, don't waste your time or money! I won't be reading anything else from this author. sorry. :(Overall rating: 2.3."
2,"Same Ol, Same Ol. No Orignality","This story has been told over and over and over and over again. It's almost like all of these domestic violence books that are out-----too many of them. Typical boy meets girl, girl gets dumped, girl finds happiness story, just told with a ghetto voice. Nothing spectacular. Other reviewers gotta be family and friends. I'm an unbiased critic so take my word for it. Also, for the author's information, Saturday is the most blessed day of the week. It's the seventh day. You know. God's number 7, lucky 7. So if you were born on a Saturday, you're blessed beyond others. It's up to you what you do with it. Thought you might like to know."
2,Look elsewhere for better...,"I really cannot understand the people who recommended this book, either they haven't had the chance to read something better or our tates really differ! Through out the story you never feel a connection with the characters, which is imperative in order to enjoy a book and feel part of it...As an avid reader I've had the opportunity to read romances, suspense and my favorite, a combination of both these elements and I can honestly say that there is so much better out there you can pick out from than this book...sorry! but it is just not worth your money!"
3,Average Read,"My all-time favor Seal-FBI-Romance story is Sam Starrett and Alyssa Locke by Suzanne Brockmann in her Troubleshooters series. And frankly Hannah Geary and Luther Lindstrom story is nowhere near to that level, and both lack of unique strong characters compared to Sam/Alyssa. Having said that I do enjoy reading the first two books, and will follow other books in the series."
1,Hackneyed Writing,"The rave reviews made me want to read this book, as did Amazon's recommendation based on other things I have liked. Unfortunately, the writing was so bad I couldn't get more than 10 pages into the book. I cannot speak to the quality of the plotting, and the grammar is technically correct (more than I can say for some things that actually get published) but the style--or lack thereof--makes this book almost impossible to read."
1,Ugh...,"Normally I'm first in line for a romance book and have been known to like even the cheesiest of books but this one is, unfortunately, only worth one star.The plot, writing and characters seem like they were created by a middle schooler. I couldn't even get into the storyline because I was so distracted by the horrible writing!Truth be told, I only read two or three pages before I threw the book away. Just a pure shame."
3,"wonderful hero and heroine, not enough dialogue","To start, I read MMelton's 'Next To Die' first and fell in love with that book, so then I started reading her previous books of this series. The great news is that her books get BETTER and better. The bad news is that I didn't like the older books as much as I enjoyed Next To Die, so I'll have to wait till a newer one comes out.About this book, I really like the hero and heroine, alpha male and super girl. Hannah is strong, and not sitting there helpless waiting for rescue. And Lindstrom is an ex-football star who also have manners and modesty, a real hunk of a sweetheart.But, there wasn't enough dialogue. The sizzle is not quite there. And the side story about another SEAL and the woman who only wanted to have a baby did not really tie in to this story; seems kind of thrown in, not adding much. Although I did enjoy their cooking scene, and who can resist a man who cooks chicken mole for you from scratch?? and of course, he has a nice body too."
3,"Better than the first book, but not by much","There are some positives about this book...but even though I just finished reading it about 4 hours ago, I can hardly remember what happened with the main characters beyond the big trial (that ended quite abruptly). So if you're trying to find a story where you can connect with the characters, I don't think this is it. My biggest problem with it was that while both Hannah and Luther are incredibly smart and well trained, they couldn't see who The Individual was, even while it was obvious to someone right alongside them, Westy. What really bothered me, however, was the ending. One second Hannah is talking about how she won't compromise at all, the next she changing her job altogether. It makes no sense."
3,Everything You will ever need to know to start driving a big truck,This book was OK I taught the author talk too much about himself still it was informative
4,A good time flick!,"This isn't Fellini. Its spaghetti bolognese, low budget, cute, and funny. These characterizations are dead on as anyone from the East Coast knows. A good time flick."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I almost never write reviews but this one is so bad that I felt I had to. The idea of the movie has potential to be hilariously funny or a great suspense movie; what I watched was neither. The story jumps around from place to place so fast missing key details that you almost feel lost at times. None of the actors do any good making the story believable. The acting was so forced at times that I felt like I was watching a very bad play. If ramdom people were picked off of the street you would get higher quality acting. From the very first ""Mexican"" scene on I was caught up in how over the top fake it was. The camera is never even held steady. The only descent job done in this movie was by the dog, although I never really understood why the dog was such a major part of the plot.This movie reminds me of a bunch of kids getting their parents video camera and trying to shoot a movie. It's just that bad. If I could have gave it 0 stars I would have."
4,Great direction!,"I saw this movie in new york at least a year ago, granted I did have several cocktails prior to seeing it, but it was hilarious. Explosions and stunt scenes were brilliantly directed. It does drag in some spots, mainly in parts featuring the rat of a dog, thus I gave it 4 stars."
5,Great Debut,"This debut album by lloyd is amazin'....not to mention the boy is very handsome but he has the voice to go with it, and the songs aren't cheesy or corny they are mature, very sensual type songs, i love practically every track, i think he's a great talent and i hope he continues to make good music...even if he isn't with murder inc. any more (he's now with jazzy phae, on i think sho'nuff records!)"
3,"Good album. Could have left out the ""gangsta"" songs","Lloyd's album is good, but he could have left out the gangsta based songs that dominated the first few. It kind of limits him as a singer. The street slang and the excessive cursing come off as ignorant and cold from him. When he does smoother stuff like Southside and a few other ballads and cleaner uptempos, he's that good. When he tries to come off hard like one of the street rappers, he rings flat. But he's relatively a new singer, and he can work on it for his next album. He just didn't make a strong enough album to compete with Usher's current mega-selling album for the male singer competition."
3,COOL DEBUT,this debut was good.Its not all great like everybody is making it seem.There are times when u have to push the skip button but not too many times.At times his voice tends to hit up in those notes which make him sound like a female but its all good th boy can sing.for example yes when he was on 106th & Park he sounded better than he did ont he album and he can sing..NOTEABLE TRACKS:**Hey Young Girl**SOuthside**Take It Low**Trance**Cadillac Love**Feelin You**Sweet Dreamsthis album is for sure worth a listen.It s not in my favorites but i listen to it i guess often or every once in a while..Im sure the next album will eb more stellar..and on point..but otherwise solid debut...OVERALL GRADE = 79/100 C+
5,Lloyd,"Lloyd has a great voice, and the albums hot. Favorite Songs, Southside, Tke it Low, Caddillac Love, and This Way."
3,"Good album, too many curses","Good album, just wish he and the Inc. could've left out some of the cursing and gangsta-cliche's so I could give the album to my lil sis. I thought the album would be trash, but I have to admit, once you get past his annoying voice, he has some aiight songs."
2,who are you people listening to?,"Alright...i'll admit it...southside is a catchy song...but um, dude cannot sing...he's ugly and he looks like a bat....but this isn't about looks....alright...#1) he cannot sing...#2) he makes ashanti sound like aretha franklin....i mean come on now people...i downloaded the CD because my friend said it was good...the lyrics are alright...and the song starts off nice, but once the hook comes in and lloyd starts thinking he can hit high notes and stuff...it's a wrap....why did ""i'm a G"" start off like that...i mean, what really was it's purpose...lloyd is not opera...and then ""you got me hooked like a bra""? are you serious people? well i guess i've ""hated"" enough, because i know that's what people are probably going to say i did...but i did not hate, i simply told the truth"
3,its aight,ya dis cd is aight..sum of da songs r sum shizznit..but othaz r tite..lyk southside original n da remix n hey young girl n hustler n my life n sweet dreams..but only if u really lyk southside den u suld get it cuz u wont lyk da otha songz if u dun lyk southside but dun waste money on dis..u suld bootleg da cd..dats wut i did..but newyz ya da cd is aight
3,Southside,"I only really bought this CD because I'm a fan of his smash hit ""Southside"" and Ashanti (she's featured on the LP twice). I wasn't all the interested in Lloyd himself, and I'm still not. Not all the songs are great on this CD. Which I expected better because how good ""Southside"" is. Some of lyrics are very weak, and Lloyd doesn't seem to have a strong voice, and at times can sound somewhat girlish. Don't get me wrong there are some enjoyable tracks on the album. Lloyd's deut with Ashanti, the tittle track ""Southside"", is probably the best song on the CD. It featurs great lyrics and great vocals from both singers. ""Hey Young Girl"", ""Take It Low"" and ""My Life"" are also some of my favourites. ""Caddillac Love"", featuring Taniya Walter, is a great song too but is too much like ""Southside"". So, for a debut album I guess it's alright, but hopefully Lloyd will get it right the second time around."
1,Lloyd is garbage,"If you want the illest ""Lloyd"", go buy Lloyd Banks, not this loser, another useless follower of Ja Fool."
4,Pretty good for a debut album,"Let me start off by saying I just recently became a Lloyd fan thanks to his current single 'You'. LOVE that song... and the video that goes with it. Since his new album doesn't come out for a while still, went and bought his old one. It's not the best album, but it's not terribly bad either. I'm a big fan of Southside, Hey Young Girl and Feels so right.Lloyd's voice is unique, very soothing, very 'south'. Sorta reminds me of DeAngelo whom I love. Something tells me Lloyd will blow up in '07."
1,WHo the hell is this guy,Who or where did this guy come from?? look at the front cover. he looks like Jago From Killer Instinct or a Brandon Lee with F*cking braids. this album is laughable and retarded. i would be soo embarassed to own this album because this guys a disgrace and he looks like Jago.
5,Really niice cd,"hey guys and girl i got this cd today and i rilly luved it..i got the edited version but it is great..im 12 years old and this cd is really nice. my favorites tracks are trance,take it low,my life, and I'm a G...everything was good 2 like southside and the remix to it with that guy scar. Overall this is a cd im jammin 2 all the time so go out and by it!"
4,Lloyd is a superstar,"This has to be one of the best R&B albums this summer. The eighteen year old ATL native Lloyd Polite, has so much talent its insane! this is one album I can honestly put into the stero and let it play with skipping one track. His voice is amazing, very angelic & the topic he sings about are very realistic."
3,Average....,The best song on this cd is southside. Another track that stands out to me though is the very first one... ATL Tales/Ride Wit Me.... ja rule spits an incredible verse on this track. Overall i gave this CD 3 stars because the production was ok and most of the songs were ok.
2,Trash,"I would only buy this album if you really really liked ""Southside"" or ""Southside Remix"" because the rest of the album is just trash, the lyrics are corny & the beats suck. The collaboration with Lil Wayne in ""Trance"" which was produced by Rodney Jerkins was the albums worst song."
4,I HOPE HIS NEXT ALBUM WILL BE EVEN HOTTER!!!!!,"I think Lloyd is very talented and it's crazy that people can hate when they don't even have the talent to begin with. I really enjoyed Lloyd's first solo album had no idea he was part of the group N-TOON but I got nothing but love for the boy and can't wait til his next album drop's love the new single ""You"" it's a good listen everytime I listen to the song I have to put it on repeat. Hurry up with the Album!!!"
5,Lloyd Did Hiz Thang -No Lie-,"Maaan, I Gotta giveDa Nigga Lloyd Hiz Props...He Really Did Good Wif Diz AlbumI wuzn't gone buy it becuz the only reasoni liked him cuz he did a song wif Ashanti and i luvAshanti, But i'm glad i got dis Album, It's FiyahNo Lie..... Songz Like Hey Young Gurl, Cadillac LuvN My Life... N Otherz... Da Whole Album!... Iz JusFiyah, I Didn't Think Id Like It Dis Much but I'mReally really Feelin' IT.... No Lie...I Recommend Dis album 2 Anybody Fa'real...Ju Boi'Shard"
1,Murder Inc.'s Worst,This dude sucks so bad. Yeah sure he got 2 hit songs but the fool can't sing. His voice is awful. Its sad that people with no kind of voice get signed to a label and the ones that can actually sing don't get no kind of credit. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
3,Expensive and fishy tasting.,"I also take Fish oil daily. When I agreed to take this Krill oil, I read on the bottle that it wasn't fishy tasting. Not true. You will taste this for awhile. I am sure of its stated benefits but its twice to three times pricier than Fish oil with no advantage. Its okay."
3,Not Jarrow's Best,"First of all, let me say I am a huge fan of Jarrow's products, most always they are top notch. Upon opening this one, it was ""extremely"" fishy, which is surprising because I also received Jarrows EPA/DHA Balance and they somehow gave it a nice strawberry scent to it and it left no fish burps. This Krill has a ""sardine"" taste to the 10th power. They should really think about adding something to offset the Krill. Secondly, two soft gels have 230 mg omega-3 fatty acids. That is not enough. Of that EPA is 115mg and DHA is 65mg. That is way too low a dose for an average man.On this note, I would recommend Jarrow's EPA/DHA Balance. This Krill doesn't quite make the cut in taste and in performance."
3,My last bottle smelled like the air coming out of an old car tire,"I've ordered this brand twice. I started taking Krill Oil because I had joint pain. It seems to work for that very well. The first bottle of Jarrow Krill Oil had no odor at all. The last one I ordered really has a strong smell...like air being let out of an old car tire. Whew!...I have to hold the bottle WAY AWAY from my nose when I open it. Even with the objectionable smell, it still DOES NOT have a bad or fishy taste thank goodness. I might try another brand, but this brand does seem to do what Krill Oil is intended for, and that's get rid of joint pain."
4,It's shell fish extract - of course it smells,"but not any more than if you had a shrimp coctail.I started taking this last year for arthritis and cholesterol, and I noticed in a month's time my movements were less painful and I felt better.only a couple negatives:the need to offer bottles of 180 caps or more so you can get a 3 month supplythe price - 30 cents a pill when you buy the 60 quantity.half that would make me feel alot better (no pun intended)"
3,Potency info,"The potency (as seen on their website) is 1000mg for 2 caps, so if you want to take 1000 mg a day, this 60-count bottle will last you one month.I have no idea why Amazon / the brand do not indicate the potency here. That should be the first thing to specify.Edit:I ordered this and I am satisfied with the product. I have no idea what others are talking about with the smell. I mean of course, if you stick your nose in the bottle, it smells fishy. Duh. But there is no smell or taste at all when you eat them, and no after taste or ""fish burps"" for me.The pills are really small, if you care about that. I just ordered some more."
1,Stinks to High Heaven and is Disgusting.,"I like Jarrow products and was sorely disappointed with this one. With all the rave reviews, I thought this was a bulls-eye purchase. Going on Jarrow's good reputation and good experience I had with their other products, I thought I'd give their Krill Oil a try. Well, as soon as you open the bottle you get knocked over by a overwhelming nasty stench of rancid fish. Putting one in my mouth was a hurdle, swallowing one down was a battle. Still, because of Jarrow being a good company I gave these a fair chance. About 1 week. Needless to say I can no longer stand the stink, the taste and I'm getting an upset stomach too. Rather than go through the hassle of returning the items ( I bought 2 bottles...stupid, I know...), they are going right into the garbage.Jarrow, you are a good company. Please do something about this horrible product."
1,Concentration??,Anybody know the concentration of these Krill oil/capsules? Might very well be a 5* item but need to know mg oil/capsule before buying. I could not find this info in description.
5,This glove works!,"This glove is absolutely phenomenal and to top it off, there's a really soft liner inside that keeps your fingers from freezing. The gloves still offer dexterity, but keep your phalanges warm while you are working outside on those really cold days, Highly recommended!"
5,Inspiration through confidence,"A good balance of well crafted paintings balanced with the step by step instructions that will bring you up to his level. After being in the doldrums for a bit I picked up this book and found myself raring to get going again. Everything he does looks good and feels accessible. Whether you want to do figures, animals, flower studies, landscapes, whatever, this book will get you going."
3,Too much information!,"As a graduate student, I used this book in a course on Spanish Dialectology. The book provides a great deal of information on the subject, but mostly in the form of examples of phenomena. Notably absent are adequate (or indeed any) hisotrical explanations are how these dialects came to be differentiated, and the book is nothing if not overwhelming. I consider it an excellent resource for examples of dialectal differences, but it is not a good introduction to the subject--use only if you'll have a good professor or another, more general, book on the subject to provide a context for the information. Also, the book assumes you have a certain amount of knowledge of the history of the Spanish Language, and of phonological notation (none of which is explained, and most of which does not follow the IPA symbols)."
4,"Cagney at his best, you never know where he's going next.","This warped comedy, set in Berlin just before the wall went up, is one of James Cagney's best. His harried Coca Cola exec. is the poster child for stress. Tapped to take care of his bosses impulsive daughter, Cagney goes through the wringer trying to stay away from disaster. And just when both you and he think the situation cannot get any worse, the bosses daughter runs off and marries an East German Communist. Just wait and see how Cagney, spewing out line after line of rappid fire dialogue, gets out of this mess. Masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, this, unfortunatly, little seen movie is a must see for any series fan of classic cinema, and also for those who just want to laugh."
1,REGION 2 means WILL NOT play in your DVD player,yea I think they should add non US to the title because region 2 meant nothing to me ...until I got the movie and couldn't watch it
5,Cagney at his comedic best !!!,"I first saw this back in the mid 70's and never forgot it. If you want some rapid fire non stop jokes, then this is the film for you. If you want to go back in time to that magic time of the early 60's before the nightmare started, then this is again the film to see. All I can say in closing is grab yourself a cold Coke and be prepared for a lot of fun!"
4,funny,I saw part of this movie just a few months ago. Where had it been? A very funny movie with Cagney at his best. Not one of the better known movies but I highly suggest this movie.
5,Great flick!,"We watched this movie recently while in Berlin visiting friends. Neither of us had ever heard of it, but we just loved it. It is marvelously tongue in cheek. The humor has great subtlety. Overall, it is very well done and highly enjoyable. One of the first things we did upon returning home to the USA was to buy this movie. Great flick!"
3,Cold War critique really attack on Hollywood.,"'One Two Three' purports to be a daring exposure of America's hypocritical relationship with Communism during the Cold War, the way it needed it both as a dark double, and as a repository for doing things it wouldn't have been good publicity to do itself.But it also, over a decade before 'The Godfather', shows how big business, gangsterism and fascism are connected,and which it does by framing the film as a commentary on Jimmy Cagney's career, from liberal to conservative, from transgressive thug (e.g. 'The Public Enemy') to soft drinks executive.The film's famed narrative speed accurately embodies capitalism's (especially Hollywood's) bulldozing indefatigability. Patchy, but often hilarious."
5,Some Like It...CAGNEY!!!!,"Another brilliant performance by one of America's finest actors: James Cagney. He brought tears to my eyes In Yankee Doodle Dandy and with this film he makes me laugh. Ladies and gentleman THIS is true talent. The supporting cast was equally great (does anyone recognize the voice of the guy who did the Boris Bad N Off from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons here???). Both Pam Tiffin and Lilo Pulver are HOT more than enough to make one defect. CLEARLY this movie was made around the time of SOME LIKE IT HOT (the man in the dress gag). Special thanks to Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, the Lennon and McCartney of the film business."
3,things go better with .......,"Wilder! And Billy Wilder's comedy [kind of Ninotchka revisited] with Horst Buchholz aptly named ""Piffl"" as the foreign son-in-law to Cagney's Coca Cola Executive. [Briefly - teen daughter marries semi-beatnic type Communist behind father's back - he rushes to Berlin to damage control.....]Witty with often hilarious moments - [especially the ""3 ballooned"" drag sequence, GREAT visual, yes even in 1961!]- and worth seeing intact today. Today? Where [what?] is the Iron Curtain, youth might ask .... this movie explains it all in delightful terms [and why possibly it was erected.]Made during the Camelot period, it reflects some of that ""innocence"".For more Wilder fun - see Garbo's ""Ninotchka"" [""wery, wery funny too""]."
1,"One, Two Three",You sent a DVD for the above move which was unplayable on any player due to region error. Never heard of this before. What it means is you sent me a move which cannot be played on U.S. based equipment.
2,Ignorance is Diss?,"Some commenters have implied that those who don't think 123 is a masterpiece must be ignorant of 20th century history. That's ridiculous! Sure, this disappointing movie touches on a number of Cold War cultural/political issues, but only in a very lazy, superficial way. The comic situations are too forced and unimaginative, very few of the gags pay off, and most of the performances are shrill (only the great Cagney manages to shine in this mess). The whole project comes off like a rush job using a rough-draft script. It's an embarrassment coming from the director who gave us one of the great comedies of all time, Some Like It Hot."
2,"Sorry, but no.","So, before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies, let me state for the record that I am over 40, remember the Cold War very clearly, am not a PC leftist, and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce.That said, this movie just didn't work for me. The premise was good, but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat. And except for Cagney, the actors were too shrill and strident. Everyone was straining SO HARD to get it across that ""Hey, folks, this is REALLY FUNNY STUFF here, can't you see us sweat?"" Comedy needs to appear effortless. This movie is wearisome.Okay, let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin!"
5,This book allowed me to fly,I read this book when I was 7 or 8 and it had a profound affect on my future reading habits. It fostered an interest in history and in Norse Mythology and prompted me to investigate these subjects further. Young readers will be transported to many other worlds in 'The ship that Flew' and I wish them a lifetime of happy reading.
4,a boy's grand adventure around the world and through time,"a book read and reread as a growing boy [1st read age 11] a book whose story, characters and wisdom remain bright, after 30 years.our young english hero finds a magic ship, and ""must pay all he has, plus a bit more"". it takes him his brother and sister to different countries, and cultures. when he learns its secrets, the ship flys them through time and to the land of its owner, Loki.this voyage of discovery was so real to me.this story is written in full sentences and paragrpahs, with a vocabulary that will stretch a young mind. it might even provoke a request for help with the words."
4,When Reality Helps Fiction Come Alive,"I'm in the process of publishing my own fictional novel (Speaking Truths, available in April) about a child who was abuducted at the age of seven, and needless to say, severely abused. When we meet my character, Landon, he's sixteen, a delequent, hates the world and viewed as unsympathetic. I used Ziegler's ""Traumatic Experience and the Brain"" as a guidebook for understanding how trauma re-wires the mind. Ziegler does an amazing job of ""simpilfying"" how the mind works to protect the abused, by re-defining reality and blocking memories as a way to self-preserve. Without Ziegler's ability to flesh out a complicated theory, my protagonist would have remained unsympathetic like so many teenagers in reality whose onlookers remain judgmental without undersatnding the intricacies of trauma. Thank you, Dave Ziegler, Ph.D."
5,If you love Mr. Bean...,"I have been a big Peter Sellers fan for most of my life, but didn't know anything about this movie until watching Ebert & Roeper, who named it a comedy classic. My husband asked me to order it, and we were NOT disappointed. The whole family enjoyed it tremendously, and while my husband and I had to do a little explaining about the 60's culture where everyone drinks and smokes, my kids enjoyed the slapstick qualities that they appreciate so much in the Mr. Bean videos they've grown up with. If you have fond memories of those hip 60's movies and/or are a fan of Peter Sellers' comedic genius, I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. We give it 4 thumbs up!"
5,British Humor,"Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers make a great combination, of course I'm a big fan of the Pink Panther series. This movie had some hysterical moments where only Sellers could pull it off. It's dry british humor set against a 60's backdrop in L.A. with Sellers playing the bumbling guest who tries to mingle in a group of relative strangers with his awkwardness and lovable innocence. Did I mention that he's an actor from India trying to make it in Hollywood. His appearance and accent blurs the line of character and actor. You'll recognize a few famous faces among the guests at the ""party"". My favorite lines are ""birdy num num"" and ""howdy par-de-ner""."
4,Excruciatingly Funny!,"Lesser known than the Pink Panther movies, The Party takes some of Sellers' ridiculous situations to their logical extreme. While there is some cultural stereotyping, the humor is 100% over the top Sellers.The film is a little dated now, and can drag in spots (the opening scene for example), but there is some timeless brilliance here to keep you laughing, and it is certainly still recommended for some unique fun."
5,EVERGREEN CLASSIC,"This is one of those movies that one just has to watch again every two years or so. It is a grand comedy of errors and well put together, although it goes a bit crazy towards the end. One of the best scenes is where a drunken waiter drops a cooked chicken on an actress' crown where it gets stuck, and then removes it, only to remove her wig as well, revealing her mousy real hair underneath. The actress is blissfully unaware of all these goings-on. It's a real comedy classic with various hilarious scenes weaving in and out of the storyline. A real classic."
4,Finally on DVD,"What can I say - I think it's one of the funniest movies of all time & Sellers fans waited years for this DVD release. What a disappointment (1 star less) that no extra out-takes or ""making of"" footage was added to the DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie!"
1,Dog Barf,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. It is not funny. It is not clever. It chronicles the absolute low point of Peter Seller's career. It is dog barf."
1,The Party from HELL!,"This movie is pathetic. Let me say right off that I am a very funny person and totally sarcastic. I love British humor- John Cleese is cool. So maybe Peter Sellers is too stupid for my refined taste. But hey- isn't funny supposed to be funny for everyone? How can this movie be labeled a comedy? It made me cry-from the realization that I had just wasted two hours that I could have used in fulfilling my life. What a waste of little grey cells. Birdie Num-Num- in my mind that is akin to Barney humor. Total humor cesspool. This movie basically takes place in one room- how great is that? And then the elephant- just as I said ""What more can they fit in?"" out struts the elephant! And the bathroom scene- toilet paper and watercolor painting? How distasteful is that? How profoundly lacking in intellect. Anyone who watches this movie and actually likes it is a disgrace to humor. Please- don't watch this, don't buy this- spare yourself HELL!"
4,Peter Sellers At His Best,"This movie is Peter Sellers at his best. While most of it is slapstick, it's still pretty good. There are some gags that seemed to go on forever (like the bathroom sketch) and it does seem a little dated, but overall it is a very funny movie."
4,Funniest.Movie.Ever.,"See title. I only wish that this dvd had more bonus features, but I am very glad this is in my collection. This movie had me laughing all the way through it when I first saw it when I was 10, and it still makes me laugh 27 years later."
5,Brilliant!,"If you have not seen this film, and just want to be thoroughly entertained for a couple of hours, this is for you. Vintage Peter Sellars. Nicola"
5,Most Hilarious and Humorous with a tinge of Romance,The Party guarantees laughter with belly holding and volumes of tears. Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers two professionals in Entertainment.
4,"Party on With Hilarious Comedy, The Party","If you want to check out a person's sense of humor, insist they watch the Peter Seller's classic comedy, The Party. If your friend/acquaintance only occasionally chuckles, you may want to re-consider your relationship.In the film, versatile Peter Sellers plays Hrundi Bakshi, a bumbling actor-aspirant who inadvertently gets invited to a party at the home of a Hollywood mogul. A series of hilarious disasters follow, all set in motion by Bakshi.This is the kind of film that you'll view repeatedly because the gags never lose their appeal. Perfect for a gathering of friends or family. It is the first film I pull off the shelf for viewing whenever someone says, ""I could use a comedy,"" and they've already seen ""Some Like it Hot.""One famous line:""Birdie num-num."""
4,Superb Comic Performance,"By far, the most impressive aspect of ""The Party"" is Peter Sellers's stunning performance, a work of comic genius. For those of us who are tired of the over-the-top and under-the-brain stem humor of Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, Sellers's subtlety and constant attention to comic detail (I could just watch his facial expressions for about fifteen straight minutes laughing) is a welcome, hilarious respite. The downside: the film does come off a little racist, as some of the humor is drawn from the character's Indian ethnicity. But, as they say, it's all in good fun."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I'm a huge fan of Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther series. I have and repeatedly watch all 5. Wanting more of the same, and after reading glowing reviews here, I ordered The Party. Halfway through, I just wanted to put us both out of our misery, but I persevered to the end. Ugh. I think I laughed outloud once or twice. Mostly, I just felt uncomfortable and wondered what was supposed to be funny about each scene. Trust me, I'm not politically correct. His portrayal of an Indian was just fine by me. It's more that the situations the hapless character found himself in made him seem more pitiful than funny--and not endearingly pitiful as Clouseau can be. I must be missing something. Maybe another view will hit me differently. But I'm in no hurry."
1,The Party,The DVD played semi relevant sub titles (in english) randomly throughout.We were unable to remove them. Absolutly sub-standard.
1,Disappointment for Peter Sellers' fans,"The whole movie was a showcase for Peter Sellers spoofing and fooling around without any direction. That's why he needed Blake Edwards and not the Blake that let him go whole hog on this picture. It was nonsensical and a total waste of time. I was so disappointed as we had planned to have a fun evening with, we thought, would be a Peter Sellers delight, not a Peter Sellers nightmare."
5,Sheer brilliance that will have you falling out of your seat,"The viewer from Marina del Rey, CA, has no idea what they're talking about. This person complains about poor scripting, yet they have no idea that over half of the movie is improve. Believe me, watch the movie, keep in mind that most of it's improve, and I promise that you won't be able to stop laughing."
5,A Perfect Comedy,"This film is like watching a cake bake, you get the feeling that any slight nudge could ruin it's rise, but nothing does. This movie works like a swiss watch. A MUST HAVE for any Peter Sellers fan.You'll be cooing Birdy Num Num in no time!Buy it Cheapie!"
4,Laugh riot,"I loved Peter Sellers. Besides the classic Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films....he stars in some of my all time fave movies...including Dr. Strangelove and Being There!THE PARTY is one long sustained ad-lib of a movie. And Sellers is at his comedic best.You may remember Steve Franken from his Dobie Gillis days on TV....he also scores his most memorable performance as a over-the-top tipsy Waiter, who serves drinks to THE PARTY'S guests in a one for you - one for me style. He's a joy to watch.But just view Sellers in this movie and try to come away from it without uttering Birdie Num Num over and over.And keep an eye out for one of my favorite toys as a kid. The famous Whammo Air Blaster!When Sellers passed away in 1980...it was a great loss to the film world. Thank God he is forever preserved in movies such as THE PARTY!!!"
4,Very funny movie that goes on about 15-20 min. too long,"This is a must for all Sellers and comedy fans. (Also. anyone into Austin Powers would like this.) The prologue is outstanding, as is the first half of the ""party"". Really great stuff. Movie wears out later on, with some ridiculous elements brought in that just don't work. Worth it just for the first 2/3, though; a comedy master at his peak."
2,5 star movie....Budget DVD!,This is a brilliantly funny movie....but why do we get the bare bones DVD? In Europe they have this on 2 DVD set...with stunning Extras..Making of Documentary....technical documentary....mini features on the filmakers like a great interview with Blake Edwards...an extensive interview with Peter Sellers..and MORE!!!I guess MGM figures the US market wants cheap DVDs and not fully fleshed out packages....I ordered the 2 disc set from amazon.co.uk and can play it in my all region player....Hopefully this will come out in the US in this package...until then....you have a great movie at a cheap price....but the extras are in the can ....why they chose not to release it in the US?
5,What A Party,Sellers is on top form and this film is one of the funniest non pink panther films by sellers..... simply great!!!
4,Amazing.,"I just got the cd today and I must say this is one of the best purchase I have ever made. I am used to listening to albums with lyrics, however Kinski is an exception. Within 10 seconds of listening to it, I could feel my heartbeat synchronizing perfectly with its tempo. Kinski is a great post-rock shoegaze album with loads of hazy feedback and distortion tied in with a combination of beautiful mellow passages. This album is highly recommended."
4,ENO Meets Sonic Youth,"Kinski is a relatively new band that has been opening up for the Acid Mothers in NY , I would describe their sound like this imagine Brian Eno joining Velvet Underground or Sonic Youth? Airs Above Your Station is pure Space Rock-experimental using sound as much as anyting creating backdrops of colour. ""Schedule for Using Pillows & Beanbags"" features tasteful guitar line that weaves into a back and fourth riff that repeats over and over. Very cool, sort of like Syd era Floyd circa late 1967. ""Think I Blew It"" and ""Blew It Again"" are the most ENO influence tracks again with washes of sound."
1,junk defined,"whoever allows garbage like this to be sold to consumers should fired, then drawn and quartered. It is well-disguised theft, nothing more. Chinese manufacturers should be tied down and force-fed Ramen Noodles until they are able to make these devices work properly."
3,Not quite as advertised,"I was torn between buying this DVD and Jake's recently released ""Anthology."" Both products boasted live performances, but this collection offered live performances and a documentary, which was more appealing to me.I was disappointed to find that the alleged ""documentary"" was no more than a sequential arrangement of live performances and some joke interviews. While the performances are great and the footage is killer, this is simply not a legitimate documentary.If you're looking for a collection of live footage throughout Jake's years then this DVD is for you. However, If you're like me and are looking for a real retrospective look at Jake, packed with history and real interviews, then I would advise you to look elsewhere."
5,Great Pictures and a great read!,"This book was my treat for myself when I moved away from Kentucky to go to grad school in the Washington area. The photography is spectacular and shows many areas most Kentuckians had no idea existed. There's more there than Mammoth Cave and the Red River Gorge!Along with photography of animals and plants goes the story of the people who have tried to preserve some areas for generations to come. The book begins with the numbers how much habitat and ecosystems in the state has been lost, but continues with the story of how much richness remains. I really enjoyed it."
3,Wonderfully subtle pictures,"Although perhaps some of the grand Kentucky scenery is missing, there are some wonderful pictures in this book. Barnes best photographs are perhaps in the subtle colors of the prairie, the Pennyrile and Barren. flowers and insects. Some of the snow dusted scenery, such as Rock Bridge in Daniel Boone National Forest is also well done.Sometimes the writing tries to be too antidotal; for example he writes that he forgot the price that a five pound mussel would fetch in the commercial market; but I would have preferred knowing the price rather than his forgetting of it. The chapter on biodiversity provides an introduction to each of the regions, but a good map of each each of the regions would have helped me relate to the preserves he discusses."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book to show friends here in Germany how lovely my home state is, since so few of them even know it exists. I was very disappointed. The photography is okay, but far from inspiring, and does not really capture the ""great"" places of Kentucky, nor why they can be so lovely. The response from people who have looked at the book at my house is just a shrug -- no ""ooohs"" or ""aaaahs"". It really doesn't do Kentucky justice."
1,Save money and put your own tank together,"Dont put your fish and yourself through the torture of this tank. Bad filter, bad skimmer, bad pumps, bad ""cord management system"", bad powerbar....I cant even go into the unlimited faults with this thing. Save money and put together a system on your own."
3,no es el mejor,este cd es uno que en mi opinion no es de los mejor que esta artista a cantado pero si te gusta old school compralo esta bueno pero no es el mejor
3,NS300DVP,"Very simple to set up and operate. Picture is great, and great features. Only two complaints... the Sony will not play CD-R, and digital picture cd's, and the remote only controls the TV volume (no channel control etc.)"
1,Do you rent DVDs?,"If you rent DVDs, this is not for you. The player gets stuck even for minor scratches and dust. I was able to play the same DVDs on PlayStation and also on other players. If looks could mislead, this is it."
3,"Nice DVD player, but not worth the price~","It's design and the brand name caught my eyes at the first glance. And I picked it because it supports VCD as well, but later I found out my brother's (less expensive) DVD player from a different infamous manufacturer (...) can do more than this sony does. Especially this sony does not support CDR videos, which really makes me wanna return it. I am not saying this sony (...), it does it's job and very realiable, but if you are planning to play some CDRs or want more ""unnecessary features"", then go for a different one."
1,More Trouble Than It's worth...,"If you are looking for DVD features only, this will do it if you are concerned over the Sony name considering the low price. However, I would opt for a different manufacture. It turns out that this does not support CDR's. I rather get something in the same price range that does."
1,kangaroo jumping dvd player.,we purchaced the sony DVP-NS300S dvd player on 10-1-2001. we had problems from day one. it would freeze at will and go back to the start of the dvd.we exchanged this unit for another and it is as bad.at around scene 13 or so it will freeze or go into pulpertations.we have tried dvds that are new out of the box to no avail. dont buy this model it is absolute pooh!
3,well...,"Bought the camera sight unseen, which was a mistake. I shoot in a lot of low light situations, which this camera DOES NOT do well in (my old digital 8 camera blows this away). I've had to boost to hyper gain which is an extremely grainy picture."
1,think...,"The only set of dvd's that could possibly be worth $200 would have to contain the secret to immortality. These are dvd's about jujistu. If you do not mind watching instructional videos about jujitsu marketed by someone (or people) who intend to scam you, then please buy them. Or maybe you are a billionaire and can afford to pay $200 for this mysterious set of discs. I wonder if they have ever sold any of these sets to anyone."
5,Great Camera for the price,"I got my camera for $199 at Best Buy and it is wonderful. It is easy to use, but I would get rechargable batteries if you are going to take a lot of pictures. The software that comes with it makes it easy to download and delete the images from your camera. It lets you create a varity of photos, from 8 x 10s to 5x7s, down to a sheet of wallet size photos. You can also create coloring book-like pages, and even order large prints up to 20 x 30 right from the software package. I took a bunch of photos of my kids and printed them on an Epson C80 printer on glossy paper. When you display them in a frame, you would never know you were using a digital camera and a printer.The only nuisance item is that the USB connection is behind a flimsy hinged door which seems like it could break if you are note careful. But that in no way takes away from the excellent pictures you can take for $200!"
5,"I liked it so much, I bought 2!","I did a lot of research before buying a digital camera. Wanted to be able to prduce 8 x 10's and scenic pictures, in addition to movie mode. I wanted one for myself, and one for my son, who predicted he would use it only for emailing and eBay...I was prepared to buy him a cheaper camera, but I found this model on Amazon with the dock included, at a price I could only buy the camera for at the stores! Add in the free shipping for the holidays, the great KODAK quality, and the ease of use, and we are very happy!"
3,Charging is a major pain in the neck,"The camera works as advertised and is a good basic digital camera. However, I have had nothing but problems with the camera dock's charging function. Sometimes it connects and charges, sometimes it doesn't. The worst thing about the camera is that you can't bypass the dock and connect the charger to the camera so you are really stuck with the poorly perfoming unit. Tech support at Kodak has been less than helpful. Buy a different camera."
2,Disappointed,"Yes this is an inexpensive camera and probably good for beginners...if picture quality, battery life and overall feel are not important. Not impressed at all. If this wasn't a gift from my kids, I would have returned it for something that feels like a camera."
4,Humorous and informative,"After having visited one of the establishments reviewed, I thought it would be interesting to read of all such eateries listed in the book. Crummy can also serve up wonderful meals. I enjoyed Donovan Kelly's writing style and humor along with the pertinent information."
4,Good Camera but today not work anymore,"the camera is good, but someday I take the number six picture and the camera never work again, today nobody fix this camera.But I still thinking the camera is very good, the pictures was clear and high colors, I'm use this camera only twice."
2,Compelling subject; ineptly handled,"Ms. Burleigh's title says a little less that what is revealed in the body of the book. Her style is flat and reportorial, and on several occasions she repeats information for no apparent reason. I was very disappointed. I would have liked for her to have followed her leads and to have come to some kind of meaningful conclusion."
3,Unsatisfying,"This book spends too much time on biographical and other details and thus a fascinating story gets a lost in the details. I got bored by the book and it really was unsatisfying.I read Burleigh's recent book on the Amanda Knox caseThe Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Trials of Amanda Knoxand that book is excellent. I thus had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately it doesn't measure up. Nobody knows for sure what happened and who killed Mary Pinchot Meyer and so a real resolution of the case is unsatisfying. But I could live with that if the story was told a little better.The book is OK, but if you have something better to read, spend your time elsewhere."
4,A Very Private Woman,"Gave a very good history of Washington politics and life during the 50s and 60s, a time when few Americans were aware of what was really happening in their government."
1,Mary Meyer Deserves Better,"You would think that given the subjects of a mistress of JFK, the CIA, the Washington art world, high society in the 1920's and 30's, political intrigue, etc. that it would be difficult to write a dull book. You would think so, but the author has succeeded -- if that is the right word -- in doing just that. This book is callow, trite and flawed in almost every respect. The author shallowly misunderstands every one of the subjects listed above and the history of the 1950's too. Her leaden prose and tin ear don't help. This is a dreadful mix of politically correct staitjacked thinking and PEOPLE magazine style fascination with the lives of people the author does not understand. It is a shame this book was published, as the underlying story is a fascinating one, and all this book will do is postpone the publication of a decent book that does justice to the subject. Mary Pinchot Meyer deserved a better biography than this, and I hope someday someone else will write it..."
2,"Great story, not a great book","The story of Mary Pinchot Meyer is a lot more interesting than this book. Occasionally, the author tries to recreate scenes and conversations on a pretty slim set of facts, supposing what may have motivated very private people she never met.Oh, and Dean Acheson was not *Under-Secretary* of State! Did this woman read anything about diplomacy, the Cold War, or Washington society between 1940 and 1965? How could she and her copy editor not know that Dean Acheson was our Secretary of State, and a major figure in post-war Washington?Washington was a very exciting place to be -- but you won't get the full description of those times in this book. too bad."
3,"Unsatisfying biography, fascinating woman","This book doesn't answer some intriguing questions: Who killed Mary Meyer? What was the motive? What did Mary Meyer feel about her lover, John Kennedy, and his assassination? The author does take the subject seriously and gives Mary Meyer the respect she deserves. However, this book creates more questions than answers."
1,It does not deserve the one star it is getting.,"I am interested in these sorts of events, I have a degree in political science so I am interested in government officials, and as a graduate student I read boring things all the time. This book is worse than any policy review or textbook I have ever had to read.To be honest I could not make it through the entire book because it was that inane. The first chapter is almost entirely who attended the funeral. Okay, fair enough, perhaps such a synopsis is necessary to introduce everyone who will show up in later events. And then the second chapter tells you how as a child, Mary was forced to attend her parents' poolside parties where baby peacock was served on plates set afloat in the pool. Who cares? Well, not me.The events behind the book are probably very interesting; this treatment of them, however, is not. Skip it, or get it at the library. (No, really, read something else.)"
1,Don't bother,Not a good attempt to provide cover for her favorite political desire but diverting attention to a well respected president.
5,Flanders Buttocks Ointment,Works very well on a 17 month old baby with an acid issue. Clears up the diaper rash in a hurry.
4,good long movie,From what I know this movie is one of the most accurate movies in depiction of prison life. Alot of men have lost there lives being convicts. life.this movie is a great movie for the time and now.
4,Satisfied customer,"My Husband and I have searched all over gods green earth to locate this movie, sadly the last place that crossed my mind was amazon becuase I was attempting to save on paying shipipng costs, The movie arrived fast and in excellent condition, next time I will start my search with Amazon instead"
5,one of the great ones!,"This is one fantastic movie. I ran across it on HBO (called ""bound by honor"").I was floored by the quality! As a middle age, white, conservative southerner I might not be the usual audience. But I love the Mexican culture..I bet some folks were clueless reference the Day of the Dead. The bottom line is the PASSION and feeling. I may be wrong but I would think the people who have lived the life would appreciate the attempt at a realistic picture. It is hard to believe that I have not heard of this movie before!! Don't miss this one! I will be buying this one for sure."
2,Another gang movie.,"It was OK but I enjoyed it more the first time I saw it...when it was called ""American Me."""
4,The movie!,"While I am not a huge fan of the gang movies, my husband is. After having to watch it for the umptenth time, I have developed a tolerance. My husband thoroughly enjoys this movie and will watch it many more times."
5,One of the BEST MOVIES EVER!!!!!!!,"I was introduced to this movie several years ago by a friend and have loved it ever since. It has great characters and a compelling storyline that keeps you interested throughout. The absolute best part of the movie though is the quotes. My favorites are ""In you dreams Pedro, in you dreams"" (Big AL) ""I'm gonna lick you clean"" (Miklo to Big Al) and of course ""Vatos Locos forever man."" There are too many good quotes to mention them all. This movie is a must see for everyone no matter what backround you come from. If you haven't seen it yet shut off your computer this instant and run to the video store. You won't regret it. BTW Does anyone else think Miklo looks a little like Emilio Estevez????"
5,Riveting,THis movie made me really think deeply and cry also. It was so moving and made me appreciate my heritage.
5,Want to Know What It's Really Like?,"I teach gang students in ""East Los,"" and to a person they have said that this movie comes the closest to what it's really like out there. This movie touched me, I've seen it numerous times and every time I hear a line from the movie I hear one of my former students, hear what they want to say. If you want to know what it was the East Los gang life was like in the 70's and 80's, check this movie out."
1,Wont even play!,This DVD will not play on my PS3 or my DVD Player. It is like they burned it off a computer to a disk. Bery cheap will not ever buy again!!
5,It's a Chicano classic,It shows the realities of prisons nowadays and the things that happen in prison. I love this movie! It is one of my favorites.
3,I can't believe it doesn't have a soundtrack available!!,"This movie has struck me in various ways that continuously makes me come back for more. I'm not quite sure why though, maybe it's the way life in today's society depicted each character's direction in life before they even knew what hit them, maybe it's the reality in reference to urban ethnic segregation. If you like realistic based action and raw violence with sympathetical situations that are affected by realistic twists, then this is the movie for you! P.S. The music to this movie is incredible!!"
4,Glad to have seen it,"I got this movie from my friend Alex and he told me to give it a look. I watched it 4 times before I returned it to him. this is a much deeper bond than the reviews make it sound like. That changes the whole movie knowing all 3 are family, 2 brothers and their cousin Miklo who have been together for most of their lives. When Miklo goes to jail and El Gallo Negro to the Military to avoid prison you realize sometimes blood is not as strong of a bond as some people think.Miklo thinks that the gangs and the fact he is familia with ""the black rooster"" makes him safe. Watch this movie and realize it is not a prison movie it is about the strong bonds in families as well as the ups and downs of being handicapped. Sometimes nothing can stop someone from doing right or wrong."
4,A Gift for My Son,I got this also as a gift for my son. It is an old favorite movie of his. He enjoys it very much.
5,so cute!,"I got two of these seats for my daughters. My oldest daughter's car seat had such thin padding and was very uncomfortable. She loves her new seat. It is soft, adorable and she says that it is very comfortable. In fact, before I had the chance to install them in my car, I had them sitting in the living room and the girls would sit in them and watch television. They love them and I love the cup holders. Very nice and absolutely adorable and snuggly. I signed up for the free trial of amazon prime and got it in two days. Amazon has the best deals and I found this seat for $30 cheaper than I could find it anywhere else. I also couldn't find this particular print anywhere else. Gotta love Amazon!"

2,a bad habit for kids,"OH boy this movie is about mexican gangs in L.A. the movie is really a bad habit for every one,because it has a lot of violence and bad language etc.well it has lots of ACTION thats the best part but the director of this film could hire better ACTORS OF HOLLYWOOD LIKE JOHN LUGUZANO FROM EXECUTIVE DECISION,ANTONIO BANDERAS FROM DESPERADO,CARLOS GALLARDO FROM EL MARIACHI,EDWARD JAMES OLMOS ,JIMMI SMITH,ISAEL MORALES FROM MY FAMILY AS MI FAMILIA.IF AT LEAST ONE OF THESE ACTORS CAME OUT ON BOUND BY HONER THAT WOULD MAKE ONE OF MY FAVS OF MY DVD COLLECTION.but oh well,RENT IT FIRST..."
2,HAVEN'T FINISHED WATCHING IT.,THIS MOVIE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOT A CLASSIC BUT IT'S OKAY. THE TITLE IS HOTTER THEN THE MOVIE. LOL
1,BLOOD OUT!!!,"This movie was lame! Bag acting, bad dialogue, bad directing, just bad! Who said chicanos like benjiman bratt should look like jewish homies, and Meklo are a typical chicano name, Ha Ha! the only positive thing I can say about this flick is it does end.Blood in( my cash) Blood out( should have killed myself for watching it)"
1,CALL THIS ACTING!,"OH SWEET MOSES. I CANT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS ON HERE ABOUT THIS FILM ,THE MAIN ACTORS CANT ACTUALLY ACT .PLEASE, THUMPING YOURE CHEST AND SPOUTING ""VIVA LOCAS FOREVER"" OR WHATEVER ISNT ACTING!AND ITS JUST SOOO UNREALISTIC I REALLY EXPECTED MORE FROM THE ""OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN"" GUY BAD BAD BAD INFACT VERY BAD."
3,"Good , club-stomp Laibach","Laibach has always produced varied work (from stomping dance tunes to overblown soundtrack melodrama), but this album is definitely for the fans who prefer the EBM-style Laibach. It's a solid album with not much filler.My one complaint: there are some very good tracks on here that feature very silly choruses of female singers. As soon as the chorus comes in, it sounds like Laibach is just making a joke of the song. What were they thinking?"
5,WOW!,"I've always loved Laibach, but this album was an unexpected treat for me. Even if I had specific expectations for this album, I couldn't have imagined the new direction they would've branched off to. Don't worry... although the style of the album is different, you still get Ivan's incredible basso profundo, you still get some orechestral elements, and you still get the Eastern Bloc sounding choirs... but this time around, it is melded with hard, almost old-school sounding electronics and stiff beats. Imagine earlier Nitzer Ebb married to the typical growling Laibach vocals and you will be well on your way to understanding what this album sounds like. A rare combination of something that sounds vaguely familiar while having an identity all it's own. Brilliant!"
5,Simply THE POET,"Three versions of this beautiful song : WWD Mix, WWD Club Mix (all remixed by Frisky)and the album version. Ironic lyrics and irresistible sound . Plus the previously unrealised Saturday , slow song where amazing Andres'voice melts perfectly with guitar's sound. If you don't have it you have to buy it right now !"
4,works for me,"I tried to find this tire at the local schwinn bike shop after months of back order I gave up. I even tried our local Wal-mart, where we bought the bike. We don't carry that item, don't even know where to order it. Tried Amazon wham-bam thank you madam. Even found tire and tube for front wheel. I'd buy another if I needed it. Great price also.Someone is happily riding their bike right this minute. A fat tire, Schwinn, chopper bike with new tires classy!!!"
5,Can't wait for the movie,This book is a real page turner-It kept me on the edge all the way through. Your attention to detail is incredible. Looking forward to the sequel. Thanks for a terrific ride.
5,Awesome Read. This Book Will Really Make You Think.,"This book will really make you think about ancient African civilizations in a whole new light. From start to finish the book captivates and catapults you into a viseral experience that can only be felt by reading its pages. This book would make an awesome film because it would be epic in size and scope. I tip my hat to you, Mr. Gregory Townes! I can't wait for the second book in the series."
3,Jam packed with practical ideas and interesting theory,"The combination of the various backgrounds of the contributors of this text has given it a richness and clearer sense of the whole picture of how and why to educate for character that you will be hard pressed to find in many current character education texts.In addition, the Devine, Seuk and Wilson have managed to present the well-researched material in a way that is palatable. To sum up, it's one-stop shopping for ways to foster character and emotional intelligence, good relationships and social responsibility."
4,This may help,"This is a good set that with a lot of great music. The only problem with this set is that it sounds like a bootleg recording, from a record player no less!! The sound quality on this is atrocious. This is a good set if you're starting to get into this band."
4,All of Marley's hits are combined in this kick-ass album,"I probably shouldn't be the first person to write a review on ""Reggae Fever"", but oh WELL! I've listened to plenty of Marley's albums and most of them are VERY well made and I usually like most of the songs on each album. On this one, however, I'm not left wanting to here one specific song that just happens to not be on that particular album. Reggae Fever defintely does not leave you hanging. It's also a nice slew of various songs that, try as one might, a mix tape just won't cut! I definitely recommend this album to anyone who needs a nice one to two hours of groove music, but doesn't want to hassle with changing CD's all the time!"
2,Old School Skate Punk.,"JFA is one of those bands that I love some of their songs, but the rest leave something to be desired. For me, this is a great historical record. A compliation of their old stuff. The record has a few (in my opinion) great songs and the rest suck. Sorry guys....it is just my opinion..that shouldn't mean much."
1,Franklin Go Diego Go Hopping Ball-,"I received this product and did not know I had to order a special ""pump"" to go with the product. It was not posted on the order site with the ball nor was it suggested. I was very disappointed. When I finally did get the ball pumped up, it would not hold the air-the plug system does not work! So now I have a useless ball that is not fully inflated! I would have given it no stars, but had to select at least one to post this review.Franklin Hopping Ball - 18"""
4,Good for 3-4 yr olds,"It is a good toy, but you do not get the same one that is pictured. We got the one with Diego and the tree frogs. Also a lot of air leaks from the air hole and I need to refill every other day."
4,Great new SLR from Canon,"I've been a many years user of Canon cameras. My latest EOS 630 served me very well for the last 12 years.Needless to say i was very excited when I got this one. The user interface is very well done. The controls are very easy to use and located in convinient places.The film advancing motor is very quit, in fact the shutter door sounds much louder then the film advancing.Build-in flash works very well. The red eye feature is much better than on any other camera, since it doesn't flash the flash light but uses a special bulb for that.I highly recommend to get 28-135 IS USM lens with it. The image stabilization worth the extra money, since it allows you to take pictures in very low light without flash or tripod.I didn't found the eye-controlled AF very usefull. It's nice as a toy, but you can live without it."
3,CANON EOS Elan 7/7E,"The EOS ELAN 7E is Canon's latest camera to feature their Eye Controlled Focus. Quite simply, Eye Control is the fastest, easiest method of selecting a focus point.The autofocus tracking speed of the EOS ELAN 7 /7E rivals that of the leading top-of-the-line cameras available today. With a top shutter speed of 1/4000 of a second and fastest in its class 4 fps film advance, the ELAN 7/7E is a prime choice for demanding sports or wildlife photographers. The ELAN 7 and 7E is now smaller and more compact, with controls placed intuitively, in a user-friendly design, for a superior shooting experience. The construction of the camera body is newly reinforced, with strategically placed metal top and front cover plates, for rugged reliability in any environment. And WhisperDrive transport brings near silent shooting, when used with Canon's exclusive USM lenses."
4,Art Student,"I bought this camera last spring and have been very happy with how easy it is to use. Canon spent a lot of time studying the ergonomics and succeeded in how the buttons and dials were placed. However, there was not a place to attach a sync cord. There is a place to attach a cord to an external light meter but the cord from the power box does not fit there. I ended up purchasing a hotshoe adapter. Other than this specialized situation I have been very happy with this camera."
5,Great Camera,"I love this camera cause it does everything I want it to. It has all the auto features I've been looking for. More importantly the manual controls are easy to use.The built in eye control is wonderful. I happen to have bad vision and use contact lenses or glasses. I have set the eye control for use with my contacts and glasses and can switch the camera's eye control to presets that work with my vision needs, after all I don't always wear glasses."
4,Died after 2.5 years,Till yesterday I was all praises for this camera and would have given 5 stars. Its got the features for a beginner to reach a serious amature role with low cost. Well yesterday it died on me. I have had the camera for 2.5 years and shot probably around 100 rolls with it.Now its a great camera. Its given me some awesome pictures. I like the metering except the fact that is does not have spot metering. This is a disadvantage. More over the the partial region of the camera is not well defined. I have the eye control. 85% it works and its great. But it does fail and irritates me at times. Low light focus is not so good but with the speedlight(420EX) it focus in a sec. What a difference. The depth of preview button is at time hard to findI love the fash 4 frames per second. I used it twice but it gave me great results. I love the feel of the camera.With all its defects I love the camera and might go in for the same.
5,Help for anyone newly diagnosed with Hep C,For anyone newly diagnosed with Hep C the initial reaction can be one of shock and the result can be deep depression. This book helps to shed light on some of the common stages of accepting this disease.
4,Excellent,Tres bon album.J'ai été attiré par le duo avec Stevie Wonder mais finalement l'ensemble de l'album s'écoute en boucle.
4,Eclectic,"This is my first CD of Omar's. I guess his music and style is an acquired taste, that I haven't quite savored yet. My favorite track was 2 the title cut ""Sing (if you want to)"". Track 1 ""Lift Off"" is a nice lead in song. No. 4 ""Kiss it right"" along with the Stevie Wonder joint were good. The song done with Common & Co. was alright, he showed versitility. The songs with Jill Scott didn't quite work for me, with No. 7 the better of the two. Track 12 ""I Want It"" rounds out the songs that I connected to. Will check out some of his earlier work to get a better feel."
1,"Sticks, but does not work - bad customer support","Unlike the previous reviews, I did not have the problem with the shade sticking. However, I did notice it never did darken. Come to find out the my car has UV protection on the windows, and it was long enough ago that I no longer have the packaging. I tried the Fisher-Price website for customer support, but they do not give out numbers to call. I put im two surveys - even on those they did not ask my name and phone number. Seems sort of a shame."
1,Do not buy this item!,I too wish that I had read other parents'reviews of this item before registering for it. I cannot get it to stick to the windows of my car and I am returning it tomorrow.
1,This sun shade is horrible!!!!,"Like every other review I read, I really wish I had read a review before we bought this. IT DOES NOT WORK!!! It does not stick to the window at all. I also think that Babies r Us should remove them from the stores. I have yet to read a review where someone was able to make it work! Save your money and don't get this!"
1,Can you say return???,"I have bought many Fisher Price items in the past because I have never been dissatisfied with any of their products, but this item proved me wrong. These do not ""cling"" to the windows as advertised. It's kind of hard to keep the sun out of your baby's eye if the shade doesn't stick to the window. I returned this product immediately. Based on the other reviews on this website I think Babies R Us should discontinue this product and I wish I would have also read the reviews before buying."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought this product for our newborn, and sent it back to the manufacturer because it did not turn dark blue. Not to mention hard to stick to your windows. The manufacturer was nice about sending out a replacement, and the replacement does turn blue. Only a very faint blue we the sun shines directly onto it. This product does not shade your child from the sun."
1,Bad purchase,Doesn't work at all....the shades barely change color and they don't fit well in the back seat windows.
1,Terrible and expensive,"I first tried putting these on my windows when it was cold outside. They never stayed on the window until the warmer weather arrived. Once I could get them to stay on the windows, they worked well for short period of time. Just a few months later, they no longer change to a darker color. I have never been so disappointed in a product."
1,stopped working,"We got these window clings because we liked the fact that they were clear in the dark and we could still easily see out of our back windows at night. The design on them was also very cute. However, they stopped changing colors and just went totally clear after only two weeks! I would never recommend these to anyone."
1,"Lindsay Lucas ""Riley's mom""","I don't think this product even deserves a star. I tried several times to get this to stick to my Trailblazer window and could not. This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I returned it back to the store(BabiesRUS) and the sales person told me they had many customers to return this item saying it would not stick to the window. Do not buy this, beware. I like my Pooh sunshade with the suction cups. It is the best thing I have found."
1,Worthless,These shades don't stick to the window well and do not change colors. The sun still shines brightly into my son's face. I am returning these to try a different shade.
5,An exceptional biography,"This beautifully produced and perceptive biography of Carmel Snow, arguably the greatest fashion editor who ever lived, is a sheer delight to read. The author focuses our gaze on both the biographical subject and the milieu in which Snow lived and worked. Penelope Rowland's impressive research and extensive interviews, combined with her sure touch as a storyteller, have yielded an engaging and compelling story."
4,Fashon editor of the 20th century?,"A very good biography of one of the legendary fashion editors of the 20th century. After reading 'Always in Vogue' by Edna Woolman Chase, her former boss, editor of Vogue and Bettina Ballard's own fashion biography this completes the picture of fashion in the 20th century. I enjoyed it, especially after seeing 'The Devil wears Prada' a couple of months ago. Having been in involved in Fashion as a designer and as a lecturer in design and creative cut for over 50 years it was also a trip down memory lane.Stuart Aitken"
2,A very well researched book of a fascinating subject,"Carmel Snow is an extraordinary subject and Ms. Rolands did a marvelous job in recementing her legendary status in the fashion industry. The research she did for this book is outstanding but her writing skills could be more polished at times. I feel that the size of the book could be trimmed down a little bit, perhaps they should split it into two books, one biography and one coffee table book of photographs and illustrations. Ms. Rolands' view are also very biased throughout the book. She tried to discredit all Carmel Snow's competitors and critics in order to show Snow's greatness. It's unnecessary as Snow's work certainly speaks for itself and her contribution to the fashion industry is unquestionable. I highly recommend this book for fashion historians and fashion students."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is of absolutely no help in finding a name for our baby. We were hoping to find a name with the perfect meaning, but when we got this book, we quickly realized that all of the names were international names. I can't even pronounce most of the names in this book."
2,decent name-book,"As a collector of name-books, I wasn't that impressed. The type is hard to read and search through, with the names in bold print being distracting after a while. It's fairly complete in terms of content, and the introduction and trivia bits are standard but nicely done. However, it isn't the ""greatest baby name book ever"" and I wouldn't buy it if I was looking for just one or two as reference copies."
3,"maybe useful for writers,less useful for prospective parents","This dictionary-style book contains is divided into two sections -- boys and girls; each section contains an alphabetical listing of names, along with the definition, origin, and variations of/nicknames for each name, as well as an occasional mention of famous people with that name. The boys' section is a little longer than the girls' section, but with over 300 pages of names in each section, there's plenty to work with. I found this book to be interesting, but not nearly as useful in selecting a baby name as many of the resources available online, particularly if you're looking for something a little more mainstream. If you're looking for unusual names or interesting ideas, you'll find them here. This book contains a very long listing of names, and plenty of information on each name, but it is not cross-referenced nearly as well as some of the other books out there, nor is it organized by topic or type of name."
5,Number 5,Just so you know this book is number 5 on the Top of the Top Baby name book list. p.s. I wrote another review down below so read on.
5,Hilarious season,"The gang is in true form during this season. It was especially fun to see Dwayne and Ace again. Also as usual the special features were fun, as was the hunt for the Easter eggs."
3,Beginning of the end.,"This season had its moments but it was mostly the same jokes and gags each episode. If you want to end on a high note then don't watch this season. But whatever you do, don't watch past season 6!"
3,"Interesting, but it dragged on a bit","Having just read the book, I cannot altogether agree with the glowing reviews. The hero was unusual, I admit, and the idea original, but the execution was just a bit plodding here and there. Also, the protagonist is described as a social misfit, yet he has more friends than many normal people I know. I found his economic situation unconvincing - an assistant professor buying a large house with grounds near Oxford on the proceeds of a scholarly book? A lot of the time he just seemed to be sitting around waiting for things to develop. And most of the brilliant research is actually done by his assistant Miriam, who gets very little thanks for her efforts (that part rings true to academic tradition, anyhow). She would be a perfect partner, but the hero is too dim to even think of it. Somehow I could not warm to the guy, but I seem to be in a minority here."
4,Read this a long time ago...,"I read this story a very long time ago as a young teenager, probably twenty five years ago now, so I may not be the most qualified person to review this one; but as no one else has, I wanted to say that I remember reading it and enjoying it. SInce I don't normally remember books from that long ago both in time and in development, that in itself is enough for me to note that this was a good book, enjoyable, and distinctly memorable. It was a good first or second outing for this author dealing with the ""let's explore and utilize this new planet"" theme and integrating the problems and clashes of culture between the indigenous species and the arriving humans. I recommend this one, especially for younger readers who enjoy science fiction."
4,Incredible camera; takes great pics!,"Strengths: Lightweight, easy to use from full automatic to full manual. Depth of field preview (excellent feature!), AE lock, quick auto focus for price range, seven focusing points. Countless lenses and accessories available both from Canon and third party mfgrs. If you have large hands, I recommend the optional battery pack ... which also doubles as a vertical grip with duplicated shutter control and port for remote switch. I simply can't imagine these features on any other camera at a comptetitive price. Thinking about a ""point and shoot""? Save your money and get this camera instead.Weaknesses: Included manual not very comprehensive, but spend a few hours with this camera and you can figure most features out yourself. If you need written instructions, I'd recommend the excellent Magic Lantern guide....Also, try another lens, like a 28-200mm aspherical lens, if you want just one lens to carry around."
2,"Good Camera, Poor Quality Lens","As an experienced former slr user I am very disappointed. This is a good camera with great features but the lens quality of the 28-90mm in the kit does not produce very sharp pictures. After shooting two rolls of film it became very clear that my old Fuji point and shoot was producing better quality pictures. Also, the built-in flash is a bit on the weak side. Flash coverage was not as good as my point and shoot camera. This is a big disappointment from Canon. Consider buying the camera body only and finding a higher quality lens to purchase separately."
5,Love it!,"We pulled the Canon Rebel 2000 out of the box and started shooting pictures immediately. It was so easy, and all the pictures came out beautifully. Now we have started playing with the ""create zone"" functions, and have got some incredible close-ups, awesome portraits, and other fun shots. Now I'm looking for an affordable zoom lens to start playing with. I'm hooked!"
1,The Child Within: 9 Months of Spiritual Preparation for the,Could not find where to read about this book on your website
4,Great shelf,"The delivery was on time and the shelf arrived well packaged. Very nice, sturdy and not too difficult for assembly shelf. I could be used most anywhere around the house from basement to garage to office and living room and can hold quite a heavy load. I purchased one like this in the past and therefore knew what to expect. Definitely worth the expense.The only thing that reduced my rating is the chrome finish quality that is not as good as on the same shelf I got few years ago. It is still acceptable though not as shiny."
5,sturdy and nice looking,My order came quickly and the shelving was as I expected. It is sturdy and clean looking. I put two units together in about 30-40 minutes tops.
5,Great buy!,"This was very easy to put together. I do wish the directions where a little clearer, it took me till the fourth shelf to figure out how it worked. The second one I did put together very quickly. For the second one, I actually didn't put the two poles for the sides together. I got the first couple of racks on the four bottom poles and then screwed on the second half of the poles before I completed the unit. It was much easier getting the bottom rack on that way."
5,Good solid cheap shelving,"Easy to put together, pretty solid once completed, I'm using this for my lab and the chrome will prevent rusting. Pretty good size and not too tall."
4,Strong and long lasting,"A little difficult to assemble, and the ability to purchase extra shelves would be nice. The legs need periodic adjusting. Otherwise we are using the shelves to store rug cleaning chemicals. With 2 extra shelves we can store up to 80 gallons of products."
5,GA from Georgia,The Seville Classic shelves were delivered packaged with almost everything that I needed. I am thankful that I followed the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and ordered a mallet with my order. The mallet made the assembly that much easier and quicker. The shelves fit well in my gargage and are holding all my items. Overall great product.
2,Dangerous,"The shelf unit is actually very nice, but when fully loaded (not over-loaded) it is dangerously top heavy. The little three (3) inch wheels are sadly undersized. You have to be very careful if you move the shelf / cart at all.Seville ""offers"" the correct four (4) inch wheels on their websight, but of course you have to pay for them, and with shipping it's close to $25.00."
2,Inferior In Its Class,"The basic design of these shelves is not proprietary to Seville; I have essentially the same shelves from three other manufacturers. All are easy to assemble and are stable once constructed.However, these shelves differ in several respects from others I've used, and all the differences are negative. The screw-in ""feet"" do not mount flush with the leg, introducing the potential for diminished strength and stability. More significant, the ""feet"" have separate rubber caps, which do not fit on easily and do not stay on: They should be super-glued to the legs. Worse still, the plastic collars that snap together to hold the shelves are flimsy and do not always hold, necessitating an awkward removal of the shelf and a repeat effort to position it.To sum up: These shelves take longer to put together than similar designs from other makers, and the result is less satsfactory."
5,Wire shelving,"This was everything I expected! Easy to assemble, strong, fine quality, everything at a price that can not be beat (I shopped)"
2,Okay Product,"First, these things are pretty cheap and don't follow the instructions, I wasted a lot of time doing that. The biggest flaw is that the fasteners that keep the shelves in place are held by a tiny plastic ring, the shelves can't take much weight. I don't know why the manufacturer didn't just use circular vice grips, then we're talking a quality shelving product. All in all, I wouldn't buy this product again but for the moment they're holding up okay for the moment. I'm just scared to put any additional weight on them due to the plastic potentially failing. If you're looking for a strong, industrial style shelving system, look somewhere else."
4,Perfect addition,"Great addition to our remodeled kitchen! They fit perfectly, and I love that they are customizable. A little bit tricky to build, but that may be operator error."
5,Exceptional quality,"I purchased three of these shelving units and put each together in less than 20 minutes...that's one hour total for three units! They are very sturdy, and built extremely well! Only tool needed to assemble was a rubber mallet, to push the shelves down tight, but one could do that with a heavy fist pound if needed. This is an excellent value! I just ordered four more of them. They are great for the garage, and going to use on in my office closet as well to add shelve space there too. I am really pleased with the quality and value of these shelving units, and the price, shipped from Amazon, was absolutely the lowest I could find. I'd rate it 10 starts if that was an option!"
5,Excellent Shelving,"The shelving was very easy to assemble and was very strong.I was able to put together six units in my garage withohtany assistance, except a rubber mallet, in my 85th year."
3,Seville Classic SHE183708 Chrome Shelving System,"This selving system combines strength, durability, portability with attractive chrome finish. Easy assembly. Optional edge guards, back screen and shelving liners are available. While the product is great, the Packaging for shipment is very poor. Carton was busted on the ends, parts bag was open with parts missing, and damage to one vertical support rod."
4,organizer units,"The shelving units I have recently purchased have helped me to reorganize my computer equipment and related paper into one area. I am using the other two units to help me organize by less frequently used kitchen items (crockpot, coffee pot, grill, electric fry pan etc). I also entertain and it helps having everything on a shelve where it is easily accessible."
1,False Advertising,This is a clear case of false advertising!I ordered this item from Amazon/Target because it was described as stainless steel. It arrived and was chrome. I contacted customer service and they said they shipped the right item but would resend another one. The second item showed up as chrome too! I can get a chrome one for 40% less by picking up locally.
4,"One bad shelf, otherwise great","Overall this is a good product. I purchased the smaller cart and it's great. My shelves have one that does not fit and it is incredibly frustrating. I was unable to find a way to get one replacement shelf and was unwilling to spend the large amount it would cost to return such a heavy item. Otherwise, I would recommend the product. If anyone knows how to get one replacement shelf, please post."
5,Perfect Shelving Solution,"Perfect in my kitchen. Sturdy. Rollable for cleaning underneath. Sturdy. Did I say, ""Sturdy""? And very well made.Took a little bit of time to figure out the best way to put it together, but thankfully had read all the reviews here that offered good suggestions. One thing to add to that is that the plastic sleeves that hold the shelves are etched with 'top'. Check :) Rubber mallet. Check.Ordered additional shelves by Googling 'Seville' and going directly to their web site since they were not available through Amazon at the time of my purchase.Did not order the shelf liners, but in retrospect probably should have. In the meantime, put some bar mat shelf liner on the one shelf that holds some small things, and it's just fine."
1,Mindless Movie,"I rented this movie based on my love for Marcia Cross. Unfortunatly I couldn't even get through the whole of this movie. Even fast-fowarding, it was a waste of time. The storyline is slow and uneven, and Cross's acting is at her weakest.It's about a photographer who falls for a fashion designer (Cross,) whose mother meddles. Cross's character spends the whole movie just questioning her relationship."
3,Project oriented,"This is not a bad starting book for a multitude of multimedia projects. Their basic premise is sound and the black line masters are good for a classroom situation. There is not much theory in this text, more of aHands on type of text."
5,Perfect!,"It is what I thought it would be...We use it when sitting in a living room chair and it works well with our lap top and mouse. We put it together in a few minutes, sat down and it fit right in."
3,Good unless you have a partner in bed that likes to lay close,Its a good basic product but my girlfriend likes to half hag me and watch TV while I work in bed. This table just does not work for that. Otherwise its adequate.Peck's Adjustable Bent Wood Laptop bed tray Birch
3,Strange stuff,I never though I would end up owning stuff by Ash Ra Tempel :however Julian Cope's book made me want to discover this group. It is far from being all bad and it has not aged that badly but it is quite...special.
3,The Emporer is Naked,"No clothes to speak of if you ask me. Side 1 is pretty basic psychedelic rock jamnming, very pedestrian, hard to take seriously. Klaus Schulze deserves some credit for raising so much ruckus on one drum set in real time, but Jimi Hendrix (primary inspiration) this music is not. Side 2 definitely qualifies as ""ambient"", well ahead of that term or that style's popularization. It's a bit raw though, it just comes off as drug trip background music to me."
3,Not an album for everyday,"I'm mostly german in blood, which is why I think I'm drawn to the so called ""Kraut rock"" genre. My favorite band in that genre would have to be the early Amon Duul II. I'm also really into the Tangerine Dream, which was what lead to me buying this Ash Ra Tempel album. Just know that out of the 40 or so minutes of music this cd contains, there is about 5 minutes of near silence at the beginning of both songs, which gradually build to a series of intensely grinding acid guitar and apocalyptic drumming. One time I listened to it after eating some pizza with extra mushrooms and it sounded like a completely different album. Since I don't eat pizza anymore, though, I found the album difficult to pay attention to."
5,Great for Perfectionistic Baking,"I already had an Escali Tabla Ultra-Thin scale, which I love for measuring flour, sugar, etc., but I wanted a scale that could measure small quantities of ingredients very accurately. The PR50S absolutely does the trick!I've been using it almost every day for the last 6 months, and it's still as precise as the day I got it. I find it particularly useful for measuring spices, salt, baking soda/powder, and yeast. My little trick is using a little paper cupcake liner on the scale to hold the ingredients I'm measuring - works wonderfully - and cleans up way faster than a bunch of measuring spoons ever would."
1,"JUNK, very short life span","This scale has an incredible short life span. It'll break before the 30 days and the next one will break within 60 days. You'll get ERR messages, change batteries, etc. Its life will end not lighting up."
4,docu with real tango,"Finaly a documentry with real danced Argentine tango with normal people, realy improvising on the music. Not everything I like in this video, there is a part with Ballroom tango and a choreographed dance (orgenised by an american program for latino's) that misses the point, but I like realy the end, a ballet , but it is beatifully danced in real Tango stile, that means heavy, down to the ground."
5,Mr. Sounds does it again!,"Once again Mark Weakland has put together an amazing CD, one we don't mind listening to many times over on the way to Grandmom's house. When the whole family is dancing, singing and laughing at lyrics, you know it's a winner. Mark surrounds himself with wonderful talent to compliment his own. From a musical standpoint, the songs are mature - yet simple enough where our 4 year old was able to memorize most of the lyrics and melodies within the first 2 weeks. Great arrangements with wonderful instrumentation, including arguably the best fiddler this side of the Mississippi. We find ourselves singing these songs around the house, at school and at play. Keep 'em coming, Mark!!! We can't get enough!"
5,FASCINATING MARGARET MEE,I have read another book by Margaret Mee and must confess to being fascinated by her life story. Her life was one of which most of us will only glimpse from our armchairs. But most wonderful of all are her beautiful botanical drawings. This book provides a real gateway into another world.
5,Alux Nahual Completes the Circle,"If you like the music of Alux Nahual, you have to own this CD, in this album the group goes back to their roots, songs like ""500 años"" that I personally consider Conquista Part 2 are great, they combined many cord instruments and the lirics talk about the History of Central America Like in their album ""Conquista"" and some political thruths that explain why Central America has not been able to reach their full potential.""Plegaria del hombre lobo"", ""Del suelo se suele aprender"" talk about how we men are destroying our natural resources. This is the second to last album of Alux and is one of their best."
4,Different in it's backstory.,"The game sounds and looks cool, but you get no feedback outside of the statistics from the small city/country or your partners. It's basically a RTS engine with nice graphics and a intriguing concept and back story. Not even cutscenes.You also dictate the immediate players, who do one of ~8 actions throughout the entire game on queue base schedules.To me the most interesting part was the small questionnaire at the beginning.I guess my expectations where a open game play engine with cool spy stuff and intelligence gathering. I was bored after I figured it out.It sounded awesome from the description. I just knew I'd be cracking codes, and tapping lines."
2,Political Tract Masquerade,"This is a conflicted review. The author allows much of himself to show through this book, so although I enjoyed some parts of the book, I found myself disliking Barash as a person, and especially as a scientist. He loves data that supports his political stance, and ignores anything that threatens that position. Because of this, he overlooks some obvious material that would give a much clearer understanding of the topic.True to the book's theme, almost of his villians (enemies) are selected from the opposite end of the political spectrum.For someone who is naive about conflict studies, the book might serve as a general, if rather biased introduction., For anyone who has invested any time in pondering these matters, the book is a waste of time and energy."
4,Dutch Boys !,"As a correction to the other reviews, the Travoltas are from Holland and this is ther 5th album. The best way to describe their sound is 'Beach Boys meet the Ramones'. Their songs are very catchy, happy tunes. The harmony vocals mix perfectly with the 'Johnny Ramone' guitars and what you get is a full force summer fun punk album along the line of Green Day with more surf influence. The album is short - which is a good thing ! Definitely worth buying and better than most new so-called 'punk' acts that are being played on MTV these days...."
4,Good basic lesson in reading NASDAQ Level II,"The first 10 minutes or so and the last 5 minutes are not worth much. However, the middle portion of this 104 minute VHS tape, is a good introduction to intrepreting NASDAQ Level II displays. Much better than some trading coaches and other pattern/active/day traders can provide. Good companion to Jea Yu's tape."
4,For Sonny Sharrock Fans,"This is pretty amazing. Some fairly interesting Funk-Jazz from the late sixties. The jazz elements are cleary influenced by the New Thing players like Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders et al. What makes it special is that the guitar player listed as playing on three tracks is none other than the great Sonny Sharrock. The greatest guitarist of the era for my money, and there still, after all of these years, is not enough of him on disc for my tastes. To add to the delight, his playing is all over this record and not just on the three listed tracks. One of the great things about Sonny, there was no imitation, you will recognize his voice right away. If you too need more Sonny, grab this disc fast before it goes out of print."
4,Another Lost Gem,"This is a very misleading name for this band. The first time somene tells you about Brute Force you automatically think ""Heavy Metal"". But, when you see the cover of the CD you are quite puzzled and you can't help the temptation in buying it. This is a soul & funk band from the late 60's. Not to be confused with another 70's and 80's band of the same name. This group of six guys know how to jam and they definitely have the funk in them as well. This CD is a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks and is very heavy on horns. It starts off with a bang with ""Do It Right Now"". The lead singer sort of has a Jimi Hendrix sound to him. I'm sure he was an influence. If you like the obscure and ""hard to find recently remastered"" soul & funk then you definitely gotta give these guys a try."
4,Easily installed,They appeared to be of higher quality than the OEM shoes and perform without any noise or shutter. I am pleaseded.
3,Great workout but hard to get moves,"Great workout but it would be easier to catch on if Cathe had someone doing the moves backwards or sideways. It's hard to get some of the harder moves down when you are stepping the opposite direction. But using just the vocal option helped a lot with that. Overall, I would recommend this video."
4,Terrific Book,"Bickham points out some things that seem so elementary, you may find that you've been heeding his advice without knowing why - but at least now you will know why! Well written book, aimed at novices but some good reminders even for experienced writers. The book is priced conservatively, too, and written in plain English. Very worthwhile little guide to common sense approaches at editing, proofing, and writing fiction."
4,Good tips for beginners!,"The book is very helpful for new beginners. It gives the new writer do's and don'ts to get their work published. You can see some of your own mistakes or mistakes that others make. Even though I don't agree with everything said, I do agree with most of it. The book contains very short chapters that get to the point. It is a very short book but contains valuable information. The book serves as a building block of the novel or a short story. To correct your grammar and punctuation, you need to look for another book."
3,"Some useful advice, some biased opinion","I sensed an overall negative tone in this book; the author was very aggressive on making a point. Generally speaking, the advice offered is occasionally useful, but it is more aimed at the totally inexperienced writer who has no clue on how to write a novel. If you follow his advice, you'll probably end up with a novel he would like.. but there are hundreds of very successful novels out there that don't match the requirements he listed in this book. It's a quick read if the book grabs your interest, but personally, I think there are many better books out there on writing fiction."
3,Good for the Absolute Novice,"This book has the advantage of being short and sweet; it is aimed at the complete beginner and is a good primer as far as it goes.However, for the intermediate or more advanced writer, there's not much here other than something of a stroll down memory lane as you recall the old days of Creative Writing 101. While the writer's advice is often good in general, his dogmatic ""one-size-fits-all"" approach will leave many perfectly good writers feeling constricted. (Some opinions put forth as gospel truth in this book include: ""A book can only have one viewpoint character."" ""Every scene must start with a stimulus/response -- and a character choosing to act does NOT count as a stimulus."" ""Every scene should end in a 'disaster' that puts your character further into trouble."")So overall, it's worth reading, particularly for the newbie -- but take everything in it with a big grain of salt. Think of it as a source of ""rules you need to know before you break them."""
1,Nothing new here,"There is nothing new here. If you have any other volumes on the writing craft, you probably already have everything discussed here. What is discussed, is not discussed in enough detail to be really helpful. Keep walking; nothing to see here."
4,Outstanding Read!!,I purchased this book on a whim in a book store. I had high hopes of learning something new. This book delivered. As a struggling writer I am always looking to improve my craft and there were some very good suggestions and techniques mentioned in the text. I found the book so useful I was able to put together my own checklist together utilizing the techniques discussed. I will use this summarized list to review my own prose upon completion. If you're a writer looking to improve your craft this book can definately be of use.
4,The very basics on writing,I reccomend reading this book before you writing your novel and then re-reading it again when your finished. The sections on confidence and persistence are what keep me writing. The rest I read while I edit. Noting wasted on buying this book!
2,Everyone has Opinions,"Mr.Bickham doesnt waste any time in establishing his viewpoints about fiction. At best, this book is a grab bag of advice. On some points he is very clear and concise, and the essence of the advice he presents is beneficial. Then there are the other bits of wisdom that fall quite short. In my experience, just about every book on fiction writing is different. Some will give you flat out ""rules"" for how to write quality fiction, while others tell you that there are ""no guidelines or formulas"" for how to write great fiction. Mr.Bickham seems to have a firm grasp on the fundamentals of fiction writing, but his abrupt style and questionable advice offset any real instruction this book could offer. There are better books on fiction writing out there, spend an extra ten minutes and explore your other options."
3,hmmm,I was really getting into this story but then it got strange and ended kind of abruptly. Not thrilled with it.
3,The Harlequin Tea Set,This is not my favorite Agatha Christie novel.......I thoroughly enjoy reading her books -- and some I am re-reading and still think she is the #1 mystery writer -- but this book wasn't one of her best.
1,"Short Story, not a whole book","Buyer Beware! This is a short story, a 10 minute read. I did not see this noted in the description or I would not have spent a dollar on it."
4,A Real Slice,"""This book is off the hook!"" I'm sure that's what the author wants us to believe as he publishes his freshman effort at Indie Urban Lit. The old adage, ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" applies here; as I'm sure you'll agree, he could not be making this stuff up. Through the use of clever metaphors and edgy street vernacular, Mars has exposed a cross-section of the characters that populate the night in San Francisco. A must-read for anyone curious about what REALLY goes on inside a night cab in that city from another planet, San Francisco."
4,Happy,"Not yet put on the bike. The gauge looks good although I would have liked more a black and orange dial rather than black and yellow. During shipping, it leaked some glycerin due to Texas heat. Not a big deal, it is easy to refill through the rubber plug."
3,solid works 2004 tutorial and multimedia cd,The book was great but the c.d was not included therefore I had difficulties understanding the instructions in the book. Thanks.
2,Ben Sidran,I really like Ben and Leo Sidran but this was not what I expected at all. I should have returned it. Doing this review reminds me I need to visit their website for a quick look. I look to these guys for a lot more.
5,5++++ stars,"I had the honor of meeting Ben and Leo when they visited and performed for a small group while promoting their CD. This CD is great! I bought it when my boy was just a baby and to be honest...I played it for myself.My favorite song is ""Pushin and shoven"" which Leo wrote and recorded when he was just a little tike. I believe he said he was six. He's now an adult. Leo traveled and lived in Spain where he learned to love the Spanish language. Some of the songs have spanish words for the kids to learn.Buy this CD...your kids will love it and you will too!"
1,cable,"packaged poorly. spool was busted into several pieces, making unwinding the cable much harder than it needed to be. connectors were out of their package and strewn about."
5,THIS IS NOT IN WALL,"I bought this because it was the best I could find for the price, and I wanted to put them in the walls. These are not rated for in wall. These are not the cables you are looking for if you want to do an in wall speaker system.That said, when I called the manufacturer to find out this information, they offered to ""make it right."" Now, I didn't follow up on that offer, because I had already cut all the cable, it was no longer a full spool, and I felt that I was more than responsible for ordering and installing the wrong product, but even for them to offer to go down that road I thought was exceptional."
2,A bit disappointing,"Being a fan of the esoteric, I fell in love with the TV series Supernatural. Since I am also a fan of comic books, I practically wet myself with excitement when I saw this. After buying it, I was a bit disappointed. I thought the art was horrible, the plot rather dull, and just boring.John Winchester is an awesome character and I felt the comics watered down his characterization a little bit. I didn't like it very much. If you are a huge Supernatural fan and must own EVERYTHING SPN, go ahead. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Good book,It's a good book Abraham Lincoln blamed this book for causing the civil war. Harriet Beecher stowe contributed to the rise in the abolishment movement
3,A difficult read at times.,"There are sections in this book that are superb. Yet, portions of the read are difficult to stay focused on and are quite difficult to get through without a concerted effort.. Not recommended for light or casual reading."
5,The True Skills & Techniques You Need To Succeed,This book is great. No hype or theory just the facts you need to build a huge organization and make MONEY! You could be in the best company with the best products and best payplan.But if you have no distributors/customers you make no money. So instead of going from company to company looking for the best products and or payplan. Just get a little education read this book and learn the skills and techniques you need to build a huge organization/downline. That's what i did. I applied the principals from this book and went from a broke 23 year old kid to making close to 6 figures in less than 12 months. Thanks Russ for helping become successful and putting together such a great simple book.
5,Techniques are presented in clear and specific manner,"It appears as if the author ""gave away all of his secrets""! This book is easy to read and presents a step-by step process for you to duplicate or exceed the author's success. Read this book, apply the same approach with vigor and tenacity, and you too will become a great success."
5,"Midas Muffler Man gives ""5 Stars""","I have never been so impressed with a networking 'hands-on' book as I am with ""Network your way to Millions"" by Russ Paley. In my 14 years as a network marketing trainer I have had the honor of prospecting and helping such greats as Richard Kall, an icon in the industry. Russ has captured the true deliverence for the beginner as well as the seasoned professional in his long overdue masterpiece. Paul Kupetsky aka The Midas Muffler Man."
5,"No hype, just the right actions to take",Russ really has the ability to not only do but also to concisely and clearly make known what actions to take and not take while building a network marketing organizaton.Anyone who reads and applies these steps should surely experience success.
5,In A League of Its Own,"It doesn't even belong on the same shelf with my other networking books. Unlike the many authors whose books I have read, Russ actually gives you the nuts and bolts of becoming successful by building a large and healthy network marketing organization. He lays out his principles and action plans like a true mastermind. Do not sponsor, enroll or train another new recruit until you read ""Network Your Way To Millions."" At last - a learnable, teachable, duplicatable blueprint for success!!!"
1,awful,"I don't think I have ever read such a load of malarky in my life. The ""author"" seems to have written this book for the express purpose of bragging that he slept with the subject and using what he thinks are his ""writing skills"" to cram as many silly and mis-used adjectives into every sentence he writes. It reads like a 10th grader trying desperately to impress an English teacher. The book is full of quoted conversations that this courtesan had with any number of people- conversations he couldnt possibly know anything about, let alone quote verbatim. The book really doesnt tell this woman's story at all. It's just endless pages of rambling psycho-babble bedtime conversations he supposedly had with this woman. If I had to read how she reached for a cigarette with her slender manicured fingers while stretching out her long legs on the sofa and deeply sighing.....my God."
5,Awesome!,This is a great book about family and the emotional pull that a sports stadium can have on a lifelong fan. I can identify with Mr. Stanton's emotions because I went through the closing of my baseball cathedral last year - Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. Certainly Three Rivers didn't have the rich history and longevity of Tiger Stadium. Nor did it have the charm. But the best memories I have of my dad are going to Pirates games with him and cheering for the Battlin' Bucs.I've read 10 to 15 baseball books this year and I have to rank this number one. The strength of this book is that it's never sappy or maudlin. Mr. Stanton perfectly captures the essence of why millions of adults care so much about this great game.
4,"For any ""diehard"" Tiger fan to read","White reading this book, it reminded me so much of growning up in Williamston, Michigan (just outside of Lansing) with my two brothers and all of our friends, we played baseball in our front yard for years, we watched the games together and even went to a couple now and then. This book brings back those memories and reminds me of how family always comes first.Thanks for a good read!"
4,oh come on now...,"alright, maybe not four stars, but three and a half...wanted to counterrate that snobby review bashing this album,(and that ridiculous comment about ""some female vocalist to sing dark, distorted lyrics over the beats"" is begging for something like lamb or a portishead/bjork ripoff...never listen to what it COULD be, listen to and review what it IS.) and the first time i heard it myself, i thought it to be a little monotonous, yes, but if you get into techno or any electronica, thats a lousy basis for complaint...i think this is an exceptional album, and has the same dreamy, cold, oceanic qualities that eno and aphex twin messed around with, but is still original enough to have its own feel...the tracks dont drone on and on, i think you might just have a short attention span...e. blake, i think its cool, i enjoy listening to it, hope i dont sound too critical or pretentious"
3,OK,"Nice little book, good pictures and information although limited amount of invertebrates.Better more comprehensive guides on the market!"
5,Excellent book for anyone interested in marine fish. Amateurs or professionals.,Excellent book for anyone interested in marine fish. Amateurs or professionals. The truth was very useful to know specifically each species.
3,PocketExpert Guide to Marine Fishes = Better,This one is too formal and much of the content among genus' is same and therefore a waste. In Marine Fishes Michael will include hints and info picked up from years in the hobby and draws on the experiences of other hobbyists as well.
4,"Great reference guide, Authors a jerk.","Good basic information all in one place, use it all the time. Only loses one star because the author is very much in love with himself and its a bit unsettling."
4,instant read thermometer,"I was looking at purchasing a recommended instant read thermometer costing many times the price of this device...I am happy to report that this thermometer works great, I saved lots of money with this purchase!"
3,"IF you want acuracy, this is not the one","I bought this ""instant"" read thermometer several months ago. I put instant in quotes because it does take some time to stabilize. Most do take a little time. but I wish it were faster, especially when grilling. The real problem I have with this thermometer is that it always reads higher than the actual internal temperature, resulting in undercooked meat. I have tried to calibrate it, but to no avail. You might want to find a more accurate model."
3,Martin Harvey,"After working once the device malfunctioned - I reseated the battery and fixed the issue. Form factor on this device is good. However, the heat sensor works too slowly meaning one has to wait for quite a while standing over the hot grill waiting for the temperature readout to get to the temperature. Hence me not using the tag ""instant read"". Occasionally while standing for a while over the grill the readout has blacked over reacting to the heat - it recovers after a few seconds. So while this works it's because I've learned how to use it so I'd recommend looking for an alternative."
5,How pass the time!,"Great news!. But the last record, No thyself, isn't at the level for Magazine. Anyway it's a pleasure to meet an old friends. All the video get a greal level but it's a pity to see Howard with these awful trousers. Highy recommended anyway. Great packaged."
4,Oriented to the American Match,"A great book, but definately geared primarily towards American medical students applying to American programs through the American match. Many of the residencies this book labeled as 'competitive' aren't difficult to get into in Canada, vice versa. But overall this book offers sound advice for medical students in their early years on electives, letters of recommendation, grades, summer experiences... basically stuff you should be thinking about early if you want to match to a competitive specialty or program. I'm not sorry I bought it."
5,Mind Madness,"I have found that the Expanded Psi Handbook has the info that I need too add some mind maddness to our ongoing cam""pain"" (LOL)...Using this book allows me to add a new twist, as we did not really use psionics before..Most agreed that psionic powers would add a new challlenge to our world ..And since we rotate the DM/GM position we all understand ""what comes around goes around ""!!!"
1,"Open Bin, Insert Book","I have yet to see a less balanced addition to a rules system ever... I have suspended the use of psionics in my campaign until i have had the opportunity to bring the rule into balance with the power level of the magic system. Gm's and Players acquire these books with the hope that they will provide balanced alternative class ideas, and rules that can easily be incorporated into an existing campaign. Sadly this is not the case and the book misses the mark by a wide margin.The most impressive feature of this publication is the hard glossy cover which i have found makes an excellent coffee matt. To get maximum value from this book dont buy it at all. Better yet find a freshly painted wall and watch paint dry over the course of a few hours, this is time well spent when considered against the poor alternative of reading this book."
4,Price is right,"Works and keeps the charge well. Had it only 6 months. For this price, even if it lasts only a year, it would be worth it, and I'd buy it again."
2,Try the library,"If you're very lucky you may find the following books by Edgar Sturtevant in a good library: A Hittite Chrestomathy (with George Bechtel) and A Comparative Grammar of the Hittite Language (with E. Adelaide Hahn). The Chrestomathy is an amazing book, intended for beginners, with an excellent treatment of cuneiform. You may also look for his Hittite Glossary. These are all pretty hard to come by these days, but they're better than anything else out there, including the subject of this 2 star rating."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This book was definitely for beginning Hittite. As a linguist, I was disappointed with how it began its introduction to the Hittite language. The authors gave a decent intro. to grammar, but not to the mechanics of the cuneiform. All of the conjugations and declensions were transliterations, leaving the student with no way to deal with actual Hittite texts. Further, many of the linguistic tidbits that the authors offered amounted to ""that's just the way it is."" Rarely do such excuses give the only available explanation; in spite of potential evidence that would avoid such sidestepping, the authors did not comment on more concrete theories.To limn: this book is okay as a beginning, as the barest beginning, but you'll have to spend hundreds of dollars on additional texts and do your own linguistic analyses if you're serious about learning the language."
2,A Disappointment :(,"Having listened to one of the hottest Balance releases (Desyn Masiello Balance 08), I had high expectations from the follow up release (Paolo Mojo Balance 09). Unfortunately, they are completely opposites when it comes to my listening enjoyment. The tracks in Paolo's compilation are nothing but outdated. I can't wait for Jimmy Van M's release of Balance 10 to erase the bad memories of Paolo's buzz kill."
5,Great Information on Bonding with your Bird!,"This book is very good for learning how to build a trusting relationship with your bird--whether a parakeet or macaw. It contains a lot of information on bird behavior and how to solve some common bird problems, like screaming and plucking. I don't have any of these problems with my birds, lineolated parakeets, but wanted a few tips on how to train my birds using methods that increase trust from your birds--and this book delivers! While I had already read some books on clicker training animals, I bought this book for specifics on birds and was not disappointed. This is not really a book about teaching tricks to birds, although there are some tricks that are given as examples, but rather a foundation of the methods you can use to teach your bird anything! I would definitely recommend it to bird owners as a manual for living with birds."
2,Disappointed,Lots of info on why my parrot bites etc But not enough on how to stop the biting with clicker training. Way to general.Wish I had not of wasted my money.
4,"Eclectic, surprising and good for the soul","Don't quite know where to place the style on this cd - is it folk? is it country? is it easy-listening? is it rock waiting to break free? Whatever it is, it was a nice surprise and the music grows on you with each new listen. The surprise last song on the cd, which isn't credited, but appears to be an off-the-cuff last minute add on is an accoustic gem with lots of heart and a great guitar riff that stays with you long after the cd ends. I found myself humming many of the tunes in the shower days after listening ... a definite good sign! Hope to see and hear more from Garr Lange with his new cd in 2005."
5,"A Fun, Interesting Page-Turner","I learned much about Chinese culture in this novel. It is well written and a good page turner--hard to put down and held my anticipation to pick it up again. The Chinese culture is represented most in this novel, although some Thai culture is as well. An excellent read I've added to my bookshelf to rediscover again one day!"
2,"slow, slow, slow","I came to Letters from Thailand by search ""best Thai literature."" This seemed to the be most nominated. The negative: I don't know why it was so well reviewed. The writing (maybe the translation?) is a tedious march through the time of a soon-to-be-successul Chinese immigrant to Thailand. The positive: it provides interesting insight into mutual tensions between Thais and ethnic Chinese in Thailand.The use of letters _could_ be interesting; see Postcards by Annie Proulx."
2,Huge dissapointment,"I was looking forward to receiving this book. I've been a fan of Tony Ward's work--I especially like the quality of his photography, the graininess of his photos, the simplicity. This book seems like a collection of his throw-aways, photos that were unused in previous collections and exhibits of his work. Trying to see how many different body parts one can stick into female orifices grows tired after a while. Most of the couplings in the book are girl-girl, with the disturbing exception being of a girl with a deformed man who has no arms and stumps for legs. As I've already stated, the quality of the photos are nice and are in Mr. Ward's unique, grainy, black and white style, but the subject matter is tired and the book disappoints, and the randomness of the picture selection creates for a very disjointed effect--the book never gathers any steam and just trudges along. There's nothing erotic or sensual in the photos, and certainly little to do with orgasm. ..."
5,Nice green shirt.,"Very comfortable design of this top fashion shirt, eye catching color, very hip. Bought two, will buy more."
4,SNOVIVOR Review 1/30/10,Some minor assembly - easy even w/o instructions. Moved snow from 3 different storms in a week. Just a few shovelfuls and got the knack of the movement. Easy to switch hands for some variety. Wetter snow moved easier than the fluffy stuff. Wish it had a metal wear guard for ice as the plastic shovel will suffer ice badly.
2,Very small!,"My son uses this since it was smaller than I expected. Good construction, just not big enough for Chicago weather."
3,Smaller than expected,"I'm always looking for a good shovel that has a swivel handle. There are only a few out their like this for purchase. I had high hopes that I could use this shovel to clear my walkway, but after receiving it I soon realized that it truly was only for emergencies or very small areas. I say this because the shovel is very small. It's not intended for everyday use on large walkways. It doesn't have a metal wear bar so you can't chip Ice with it. The swivel handle works very well and it allows the user to throw the snow any way with ease and without bending over. It came with a bag to put it in and sits in the back of my trunk during winter time. I just wish it was bigger so I could use it every day or every day we get snow ;)."
5,Enjoyable for me and my grandchildren,"I bought the audio book and really liked it. My grandchildren usually are too rambunctious in the car, especially if the trip is very far. They are 10 and 11 years old. We put this audio book in during our trip from CA to WA and they were mesmerized. That made it worth it's weight in gold. Karla Armitage"
3,"Fun for a family, difficult for fun","If you are a puzzle-head this book has your name written all over it. If you struggle with puzzles, this book is decent for the story."
3,Not as specified!,"I received this saw and at this point will only comment on the fact that it arrived without a case. I contacted Amazon, and they very politely said they couldn't send just the case, they had to send an entire set (saw and case), and asked me to return the original saw. The new saw arrived several days later, again WITHOUT a case. Obviously it is possible to send saw and case separately. Wish they would! I really think this is a case of Amazon's customer service reacting so fast and so well they failed to solve the problem. I have decided to drop the issue - it isn't worth sending back yet another saw."
5,Great recovery time and great bang for your buck!,"I've got nothing negative to say about this bad boy. It's great for the price, and if you need to do basic shooting, it's right for you."
4,Big difference,"I have been dissatisfied with the built in flash on my Digital rebel. Bought this two weeks ago and have used it extensively. The batteries last forever. Main improvement is when using it as a bounce flash. Much better colors, softer light, no redeye. It can be used as a slave flash but only with the much more expensive 500 series. The only reason I give it a 4 is that the new 430EX just came out with significantly improved functionality. However, the pricing is probably much higher than these closeout prices"
5,Great Flash for EOS type-A cameras,"I bought this flash to go with my Elan 7E and it has worked great. It has all the features that most EOS users would ever need (vertical and horizontal bounce, fast sync, and E-TTL control). It isn't as good as the 550EX, but if you aren't planning on using mutliple flashes slaved together this is the better deal at almost half the cost (though the 420EX can be used as a wireless slave flash with the 550EX as the master). If you are shopping for an external flash for your EOS camera, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,"Big, bulky and essential","If you have a Canon G1 or G2 digital camera, you've probably noticed the limitations of the built-in flash. It's way too close to the lens, which causes images to look flat and lifeless, and the color of the light tends to wash out colors as well.The Canon Speedlite 420 is a pretty big device; it's basically the same size as the camera, and about the same weight w/ batteries. For that additional bulk, however, you get a powerful flash that can bounce light off walls and ceilings, creating much more professional-looking results. The improvement over the built-in is really like night and day."
4,Excellent product overall,"I have used this product for over a year. I bought it because the on-camera flash on my EOS D30 was too small for certain situations. I have been very happy with the results in all conditions. The flash is very easy to use and does its job without the need for any great technical expertise. I decided against the 550EX because it seemed too complicated and I wanted a 'point and shoot' type product to use without any fuss. One bugbear - there is no battery indicator, so there is way of knowing how fresh your batteries are so you only realise that they are running down when your recycle time slows down."
4,Worth the purchase,"I bought 420EX flash for use with Canon's G3 camera, which is one step less than conventional SLRs. For long my indoor photography has suffered. But now with this great accessory, I can bounce light to create brilliant and vivid images. The flash utilizes E-TTL and also adjusts to the camera's zoom.The only reason I rated the flash 4 stars is that the auto-fucos assist beam function is not working with my camera. I probably will get in touch with Canon and find out if this feature is compatible with G series camera or not."
2,Not so impressed and broke already.,"I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...Save money and buy 5XX series flash..."
2,disappointing power,"I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT. Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit. I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu. Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one."
2,Not Written for Kids. Too long. Lacks Something.,"This story lacks. The setting seems researched, not written by someone who's lived in Cuba or knows much about the Cuban culture. My 3 kids didn't like it. I am American, born in New York, married to a 1/2 Puerto Rican 1/2 Cuban. We collect children's books. We do not recommend this book. Although it is written well, my children found it way too boring compared to all their other picture books. It's not a flop, but it's nothing to write home about..."
2,Not Authentic,"The writing is too long, bland and adulty. The details drag on and on. My children got very bored, fast.Perhaps the story was fed to the author by the publishers and thus it wasn't authentic and didn't come from her heart and soul? She isn't Cuban, and maybe that could be the problem.It's waaaay too long for children and not spicy enough. I do not recommend this book at all."
1,Story Drags on and on... but Lovely Ilustrations,"Story is much too long for kids. After the first few pages, my children stopped listening and left me reading on my own. The adults in our family do see the merit in the illustrations, though. It's not a book I'd recommend, but the illustrations are lively so we can't take merit away from artist. Good artist, boring text."
2,"For adults to enjoy, not for Children","(...)Perhaps the problem in this very long story comes from lack of ""feeling."" I am beginning to believe that it is best for Latino writers to write their own stories. I am reminded of when as a black actor, time after time I was not offered a part, but the parts were given to anglo's and they were ""painted"" black. I think this author needs to stick to what she knows best. One can ""feel"" that this authro is not Cuban. But the illustrations are good and recommendable. This story is not for a young child, but more for adults to enjoy. I just got it from the library and will return it. My grandchildren lost interest after the first four pages. I enjoyed the illustrations. She's a good writer, but nothing to write home about."
2,No resolutions for the exercises,"My background is being an electrical engineer with casual interest in physics. I was trying to start understanding more about relativity.Being honest this was my first book on the topic of tensors. What can I say? tough start. Don't even bother if you aren't a graduate student (IMHO). Complex notation, fast paced (not for the student), few resolved exercises, no companion material (web pages or others).I think this book is thought to be a companion book for someone who already has a certain knowledge about tensors.In the book, there are many exercises but none of them is resolved in details, on the contrary, they are left to the reader as a ""homework"". Which is a pity because is in the exercises where you can hope to find some help to understand this complex subject.As far as I know There is not a place in Internet where one can check the resolution of the exercises in this book."
1,Missing part of the book,My copy was missing the introduction to tensors. It goes from the review of matrices straight to the calculus section. It is literally missing the pages that would have introduced tensors.
1,Seek another format,"A great book by great author. Alas the font is so small, it's hard to read it. Seek another format (exactly what I am doing now). Books should not be published with such a small text anymore."
5,Transitions model is fascinating,"This short, stunning book is at least two books in one. It tells the latest version of the story of how life arose and evolved. And it explicates the authors' model of evolution as composed of ""major transitions"" of which they discern and dissect eight. These transitions, of which an example is the transition from RNA as double duty gene and enzyme to the specialized use of DNA and protein, make an intriguing model around which to explicate various mechanisms of life. ""Origins"" in the title, however, is confusing; it is less about the beginnings of life than life's history of originating new structures. It moves quickly through the latest findings supplemented by plausibility arguments."
1,Not Typical Biker Build Off Type Of Video,"Well this video was lumped in with the Biker Build Off videos and so I guess that's why I purchased it, but if you ask me I'd say that was a bit of a sales ploy to push this one onto us. Nowhere did this video show any Bikes being built in fact it was just boring for me and I haven't even been able to get through the whole thing yet.. Sorry it's a thumbs down for me! 1 Star is a gift.. should be zero by right."
4,5 Star Quality,"The quality of these mailers is top-notch. I do a lot of online selling and this size and toughness is perfect for heavy books, DVD Combos, etc. The price is what held me back from a full five star review; pretty hard to swallow everytime I think of the per envelope cost but the security of knowing my order arrives in perfect condition is well worth it."
3,Steve Lawrence's Tribute to SINATRA,"I have liked Steve Lawrence's singing since hisbeginning with Steve Alans's Tonight Show many yearsago. This disc proves that his voice and phrasingare still most enjoyable.However, his SINGING SINATRA is a teaser. I wanted tohear Sinatra Singing Sinatra.With all due respect to Mr. Lawrence's renditions,in my opinion, Mr. Lawrence should stick to his owngreat musical talent."
1,Unnecessary!,"Steve Lawrence's original recording of ""What Now My Love"" in the 1960s, I believe, is by far the best version of that song. Sinatra's version was never even close and yet here we have Steve mimicking Sinatra's inferior version of that song! Worse yet, I challenge anyone to locate the original Steve Lawrence recording of ""What Now My Love"" --I'd pay top dollar for it!"
1,A hack's take on a master,"Steve Lawrence is a D-rate lounge singer who is performing with stolen charts. The original arrangements of these songs were willed to Frank Sinatra Jr. and Mr. Lawrence has unscrupulousy usurped these and not returned them. He should be ashamed of himself, both for theivery and for attempting to cash in on a performer who was far too generous to him in his lifetime."
4,Something different from LOT,"After buying A Crimson Cosmos, I became an instant fan of Lake Of Tears. They are one of the few bands since the mid 90s that forced me to revise my top ten lists. I love the melancholic mood created by their music and the fantasy/autumn lyrics. None of their albums has ever disappointed. The Neonai is more ""electronic/techno"" than the previous four albums. The drums sound programmed and a few of the songs have similar beats. But despite that there are still several excellent songs and it is difficult for me to choose favorites. The fact that this band is not huge is a shame, but I feel lucky that I discovered them. I recommend starting with Crimson, or Forever Autumn, both classics!"
4,Practical guide,"Patricia Cunningham offers a systematic, month-by-month guide to using a class Word Wall. The book is sprinkled with great word wall games and instrutcional techniques. I reccomend this for a new teacher in need of a program to help get the class word wall started."
5,worth the money,This book was well worth the money in helping me to plan phonics lessons that are multi-level for my class and beneficial to my struggling readers.
4,Great book but price should be $17.99. Has to be a misprint,This book retails in most teacher book catalogs for $17.99 and can be purchased used for less. It is indeed avery useful book. I hope that the sellers and resellers will take a second look at their pricing.
1,Master?,"I did some research on Mr. Alexander after purchasing a few of these videos. His length of study with Yuichi Kuda is certainly questionable and I believe he gained his rank through being buddies with another Karate stylist. His techniques are not good Karate and the videos did little to improve my opinion of this person who is known to use videos and information not of his own for profit. Much better instruction can be found out there, and if you consider this guy a Master, you have never seen true Okinawan Shorin Ryu."
5,Fantastic,This 10 volume set is a fantastic comprehensive series on Shorin Ryu Karate. It has helped me immensley with my training.The 10th volume which is not discribed in the list is on KUMITE. It is a great breakdown on sparring and shows the best techniques to use and when to use them. I gained new knowledge from this series. It opened my eyes to many techniques I already knew and gave me new insight on how to use these techniques.
5,Harry Lauder's Walking Stick,THe product was of excellent size and quality. It had been well cared for and the packing for shipment was probably the best that I have seen.
3,Surprised and Hopefull,I first thought that this book was going to be totally different from what it actually is. Now I can not wait to see if they decide where they will go from here. I just hope that they find a way to make it look like a death was actually a trance. Otherwise I think many people won't want to go on reading the series. The characters in some cases definitly needed some help but overall it was a decent story line.
1,Just Awful,"This book and the whole NJO series is just awful. A bunch of kids and unknown Jedi that come out of nowhere, running around doing everything. Why is everyone else portrayed as a bunch of clueless idiots? Why should we care when the kids are all wiped out? The whole thing is insulting to our intelligence.Why can't we have good books like we did before? When is this dreadful alien-invasion series going to end? When are they going to stop writing these silly teenage stories?Please let me know when Star Wars gets back to being Star Wars and not this weird Star Trek mess written for kids with short attention spans."
1,Horrible,"It's obvious why this book is taking so long to get published in paperback. It's HORRIBLE. Writing is amateur at best, and the treatment of the major plot disappoints.If you must read this book, borrow it from someone you know. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there wondering why they spent hardcover-type dollars on trash like this."
1,BETRAYED. WHOSE SICK IDEA WAS THIS?,"I have submerged myself in everything star wars for almost 25 years. I trusted you people to deliver good entertainment. This isn't fun! I feel like tearing down my giant hand-made poster of the SW Universe, and selling my 51 containers of SW mint figures and all the SW books and audio tapes I have purchased.I feel betrayed and stupid for investing so much in a fictional galaxy far far away.SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE FIRED OVER THIS. If it was George Lucas, shame on you George... shame, shame, shame.George, remember when Bonanza Hiped Little Joes wedding for two weeks, then killed his wife, my family and a lot of other families never tuned in again. The show was essentially DEAD.BRING HIM BACK OR I'M GONE."
3,Enough already!,I am a faithful fan of the whole Star Wars book catalog and I enjoyed this book. But I feel that enough death and destruction has occured with this plot line and it's time for it to end. I feel like I am being strung along and the story is too drawn out. It's time for this series to be over.
2,I'm so confused,"Okay, My experiance with the NJO series has been via audiocassette thanks to my job and how it takes me on travels. I mean heck, would you rather listen to a comercial heavy radio station or NJO? Point madeBut ya see, there's a problem with this audio. Corrusant, not in there; Feylia, not in there; Tsvanglah's anger at only capturing one of the mighty twins to offer up to Yun Yuzhan on his attack of Corrusant, not in there; the grieving of the Organa/Solos, not in there; Viqhi Sesh, you guessed it, not in there.What they have in there, basic simple stuff like Lando's ruse to appear betraying; the dark jeedhi, Anakin's death, Jana acting all whiny and darkish because of it, oh and let us not forget Vergere crying because of her betrayal of Jacen. You see, this is a great book. But half (amazon does not allow me to put this word in) way through the novel, the tape shuts down. An abrigged version of this masterpeice is unacceptable."
2,What was the author thinking?,I've never been a real star wars fan but I started to read the series and found it to be awsome until I read this book. How could the author have the audacity to kill Anakin?!?! How could the editors allowed Denning to kill a main character especially a younger one that could of spurred more books. If they kill all the important young Jedi Knights there will be nothing to write about. This book was a major disappointment.
2,600 hundred pages should have been 350,"This book almost made me stop reading the njo. The story isn't terrible, but this is as drawn out as the scarlett letter. Except Troy Denning for some reason feels its necessary to shove as many big, obscure words in his novel as possible. Turning what should be a 350-400 page book in 600+ pages. Plus he changes all the characters personalities to fit what he wants in his story. Basically says, the hell with the earlier books, I'm doing what I want.One of the things that bothered me most was how he wrote Jacen. Jacen is one of my favorite characters and I like him because he is a deep, introspective character. Denning turns him into a weak, sniveling little peon. He hails Anakin through the whole novel and is very condescending to Jacen.All in all this novel was enough to make me destraught, but not quite enough to make me stop reading the series, although I know many who have quit the series solely because of the book"
4,A turning point,"I have to admit I like this book. I'm an avid Star Wars fan and this book gave me something that was somewhat missing in all the other books including Zahn's. Please don't assume that I didn't like Zahn's books, I loved them. However, in all the star wars books, I never felt that any of the main characters were in trouble. They felt invulnerable. This book changed all that. It revealed to us that the characters were in fact vulnerable. I felt the sadness of Leia when she finds out her son does. I felt the despair and the struggle in Jaina. This book is definitely a turning point. Lets just hope they can make something out of this mess without loosing the feel."
1,Bring back Bantam and kick out Lucasfilm/Delrey,"George Lucas said he made Star Wars because we had no heros-all the money the Star Wars Universe has brought in made him forget I guess when he signed off on this series. DelRey looks down their nose at us fans (and in their interviews in Insider) and these (my fellow reviewers are lapping it up). Well, I would prefer live heroes myself and how long is the series going to last? At least with Bantam you didn't have to wait through more than 3 novels to see how it ends. Reminds me of some movies(like""Freddy's back"")-excessive- over & over & over again. They should of just blew up everyone at one time - it would have been a lot easier to take. I'm not spending the money/nor are the books in my bookcase."
3,disappointing101,The story was great with all the aspects being the typicall fast paced star wars we all love. But then Dennings has to go and kill off Anakin(my favorite of the Solo kids). With the death of Anakin my reviews plummetted. After the last two books bulding up Anakin as a character there was and still is no good reason to have him die. On the contrary there were extremely high hopes for Anakin as the successor of Luke Skywalker and the new affection with Tahiri. Dennings had absolutely no right to kill Anakin and send the NJO int a spiral. If I were George Lucas I would ban him from ever righting another Star Wars book again or else he might end up killing Han or even Luke. THANKS ALOT DENNINGS FOR NEARLY RUINING NJO SERIES!
3,"Good, but...","The novel is well written and suspensful, but why are all the most talented young Jedi send on a suicide mission? I'd rather see Luke and his wife die and stop getting on my nerves.I will not forgive Denning for practically ignoring the relationship that has been developing between Anakin and Tahiri. It was something I've been looking forward to since Rebirth..."
4,It'll never be the same...,"I must say that if you don't like change, don't read this book. I'm not saying it's bad, mind you, it is a good novel. But there are dramtatic changes in the history of Star Wars that take place in this novel. There were a couple of times when I was so disappointed in the dramatic changes that I just put down the book and didn't read it for a couple of days.I have read almost all the novels within the Star Wars series except for a few of the most recent ones (Phantom Menace...) but this NJO series is quite the dramatic one and with these recent dramatic changes it almost seems to me like the Star Wars novel authors are bringing the series of Star Wars to an end.Overall, this is a great novel. The only disappointing factor was the dramatic changes that occured throughout the book."
4,"Good book, annoying series","I like the book, a lot. everything they've done with the whole series is great, but looooooong. I've been reading it since the beginning and now i'm just getting tired of it. nothing ever really happens. after about 2 books the yuuzhan vong dominated and stayed that way. if they just ended it i'd be happy.its not dynamic in anyway, other than that they keep killing characters off. i got over the lack of chewie (in my opinon the best star wars character) simply because i recognize the attempt and need to provoke an emotional response.Maybe if it wasn't such a one-sided conflict i would be satisfied, but it isn't.I still suggest reading it though. it's well written and much more emotionally provoking than most star wars series. just long. i can't quite stress that point enough. maybe im just not patient enough. i will continue reading, but this is a series not for the impatient."
3,Interesting Approach,"Star by Star is a fast paced book. It will keep you on the edge of your seat through out the entire work. However at times it can be a little difficult to follow. Denning jumps around a lot during the text.However a main character was killed off, and this seems outragous. It was one thing for the writers to kill of Chewbacca but it is completly different to kill of this character. In my opinion it completly killed of the book. The events have made a lot of devoted star wars readers turn away from the new series, and I am almost tempted to do the same. The death was completly unneeded and made the book much more somber. If it were not for this part the book would be an excellent addition to the New Jedi Order, however now it just (...).I ask Mr. Denning why? It held no point and upset a lot of devoted readers. Bad Move."
2,Yuck,"Despite my title, I think the book was well written. Troy Denning did a good job. This book has a lot interesting twists and it's never slow paced. After the Vong create a special creature that is bred to destroy the jedi, Luke finally gets it in gear and decides to ""take the fight to"" the Vong. We get to see a lot more of the older generation(Han, Luke, etc.)than we have for some time.However, when my favorite character in the whole EU died I was really annoyed. Yes, it is a war, and in wars people die, but when I read a science FICTION book I'm not looking for a big o slap of unhappy realism, especially from Star Wars. The death damages part of what makes Star Wars better than other sci fi series. I still feel depressed. I hope NJO is going somewhere good with this, because otherwise all the death did was anger a lot of people. This is my opinion and I don't care what all those weird people who think the death was a good thing say. It ruined a great book."
5,A great book,"I thought that Star by Star was one of the best new jedi order books I've read. It always ticks me off when stories are unreal with all the main characters surving against huge odds. It would have been unbelivable if all the Solos and Skywalkers and everyone else we've come to love survived this threat.Denning is an excellent author, making the story convincing. I cryed my eyes out when Anakin died and even more so at his parent's response. Read this book."
3,What the ? ? ?,"By now you probably know, so what's the deal? Was it just me, or did the supporting characters not really react the way they should have to the shock? Why wasn't Han's response focused on more? Because the author didn't have enough time to develop things. Although the book is dramatic, I felt this was a shock for shock's sake. I wasn't outraged, but I agree that one of the strongest characters in the book was just starting to develop and then snuffed out. Denning tried to cram too much, too fast. A plot like this needs to be spread out over many books. It's not the loss; it's the prematurity of the character in contrast to the prematurity of the plot climax and frankly the seeming prematurity of the writer."
2,Enough already,"My word, I am tired of this series and unfortunately there seems to be no end in sight. This storyline keeps repeating itself. Yes, the Vong are not at all nice beings; we figured that out. Sure, the Solo kids are experiencing teenage angst magnified by their special abilities. Ok, the New Republic has become mired in corruption. So tell us something we haven't heard for the better part of 2 years! Give us a reason to care!What I wouldn't give to read a good yarn by Timothy Zahn about now. He could certainly breathe life into this dying franchise. Years ago I used to anticipate the release of a new SW novel. Now I just wait until it shows up at the local library.Time to put this sorry saga to rest and come up with fresh material. Like the SW characters, we're not getting any younger."
4,"Not perfect, but certainly not hideous!","Okay, yes, I'll admit that killing off you-know-who wasn't a very nice thing to do, but I really liked the style in which this book was written. I literally couldn't put it down. I don't think that this particular book's ""death"" was as bad as Chewie's, but then again, we've known and loved Chewie since we first saw Star Wars, right? overall, I think this book was well-written and a must have, even if the story line was a little bit tragic."
1,Del Rey continues to destroy Star Wars,"When this series first started I was excited. Finally there would be a new enemy for the New Republic to face. I was quickly disappointed. This series only point so far has been to kill characters for no reason at all.This book was no exception. This novel had very little story at all and dragged on. Countless characters were killed including two who were important to the novels.For the past few years the novels have been developing Anakin and has even had him as the lead for the last few novels. Now out of the blue they decide to kill him pointlessly, like Chewbacca.Personally I won't be buying any more of this series and I would recommend anyone who would want to read a good Star Wars story to pick up the Bantam Series."
1,The Absolute Wrong Way to Go!!!,"Like most people, I was devastated when Anakin was killed. Yeah, yeah, it was in a blaze of glory and all and he will be remembered for all time, blah, blah, BUT COULDN'T THEY HAVE JUST KILLED SOMEBODY ELSE?!?!?!? I recognize the need to kill a major character every once in a while, but Anakin was the wrong person to kill. Jacen and Jaina are not the ones you want leading the next generation of Jedi (and who knows what the Vong are going to do to Jacen now that they have him). A part of me is still hoping that Anakin is still alive, even if they have to bring him back in the cheesiest way possible, I really don't care. Anakin used to be the one that was ignored while the focus was on the twins, but now that he had finally stepped to the forefront and achieved his potential, why kill him? Kill Jacen instead. Anakin's ending would have been perfect for Jacen. Anyway, the only reason I will continue to read this now ruined series is to find out what happens next."
2,Dissapointed,I read this book and have been an advid reader of star wars new jedi order and I must say that I am bit dissapointed with the killing of anakin solo. I am sure that it is important that there be a death to the jdei's elite but the selection wa poor in my opinion. He was dvelopning into such a huge character to have killed off in such a manner by a new author not sharing the vison of his predecessors. The over all plot was good and I hope if you a a reader are interested in seeing an incredible turn of events then the author succeded in its task. At this point yo umust read the book to understand the next series of books but be aware that storyline is flaky.
3,End of the best.,"I thought that this book would be great because of the ones that came before it. But I was wrong. It was well written, but they killed off my second favorite character. That was really dumb. Why the heck did they do that? There was no reason behind it. The way I see it is they killed him just to get rid of him, just to make it seem like the galaxy had no hope of winning the war. But why not someone else? I'm not going to tell anyone not to read it but I wouldn't say that this book is the best, and neither will any of the ones that come after it."
1,Should be a banned,"This writer, Troy Denning, is a man who is a great writer, probaly a smart man and and just destroyed this good series. Does anyone realy believe in a series were they get a character all ready for saving the galaxy and then kill him (Anakin.) Do not read this book. It is dull except when they grab your attention by killing a character ever few seconds. I think Mr. Denning killed Anakin just so his book would be the Star Wars to remember.Note to Troy Denning: If you ever dare write another Star Wars book I will publish bad reviews of your wretched books.I would also like to note that Amazon.com should let its readers give the books zero stars. I felt ashamed that i had to give the book one whole star."
4,Good Book,"Overall, I will say this is a good book. There is many plot twists that kept me guessing. The author grasped the characters' personalities quite well indeed. The wording was well put and the plot excellent. One thing I did notice was that this author decided that the Vong's armor was very weak against blasters. But the main reason I gave this book a four star instead of a five is because they killed Anikin. Would you stop killing the main characters for peat sake!"
4,"Dark, but a good story","First off, I have to say, that this is probably one of the darker books to come out of the Star Wars series. However, that said, this is probably also one of the better ones to come along. Denning has been given plenty of time to develop characters, and does so quite well. It's also refreshing to see the Jedi finally starting to do something. While some have argued that the death of a major *koff* character ruins the book, it propels things forward in a manner similar to the death of Chewbacca in Salvatore's Vector Prime. Don't let the length or dark tone of the book scare you off, the book is too good to skip."
3,"A Solid ""Turning Point"" to the story.","Good book, a tough spot in the overall story to write. Lots of very important events described with good detail and story flow but character development was just very average. There were a number of new characters in this book and I would have liked to see more background and development."
4,A long trip now a dark road,"I always thought that Star Wars books were supposed to make you feel happy? This one leaves a sour taste in your mouth, but at the same time is very good in its own right. Mr. Denning has done a very good job here of cramming a lot of material into one novel, this ""need for space"" is preety much semless. However you may feel about this serise(New Jedi Order) you do not want to miss the last 20 pages.Overall=This book will back you feel happy and sad at the same time."
3,ok yet not ok,This book was quite intresting in almost all scenes and I have enjoyed it. Yet the most chilling part about this is the death of a great character we've all come to love. Other authors spent years developing this character and he was just killed of in this book. I really don't think that was justified.
1,Pointless,"Star by Star was exciting and well written, and further reduces the Star Wars universe to a pointless endeavor. Personally, I have decided to exempt the NJO from my version of Star Wars--Vision of the Future was a great ending as far as I'm concerned. Star by Star (and other NJO novels) seems to make all other novels, and (more importantly) the movies obsolete. What does it matter if Han and Luke and the rest defeat the empire? Thirty years later the whole galaxy will be killed by the Yuuzhan Vong anyway. And due to the loss of major charactors, it's hard to believe any of the surviving charactors will ever by truly happy again. I'd stake my bets that the NJO series is old man Lucas' attempt to rake in some more cash for his own empire. But for me, it has just gone too far."
2,What Was he Thinking!!!!!!!!!,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGggggggggg Wile this book was well written & may have worked as a stand alone novel, it does not belong in the Starwars universe. First; the author does not continue with any of the previously established sub-plots ( come on what's up with the Shamed?). But, instead goes off on his own crazy tangent and does little to further the overall story line ( unless you call killing off a couple pivotal characters furthering a story ). Now I'll leave the technical errors alone, really I will, since I'm one of the few that probably care anyway. But, this author does little for the series other then create a bunch of problems for the next author (who's some one different BTW) to try and solve."
1,Star by Star - Troy Denning,I hate it when my favourite caracter dies. So I dont want tono anything more about the book. I think it will be the lastNew Jedi order book that I will Read. I am a Star Wars fanaticbut I am realy disappointed in the way the story line is going.I realy hope someone can give me a good reason to go on readingthemStar Wars FanaticNicci
2,Save your money,"I bought this ash hoe handle based on the other reviews and now I wish I had gone with the cheaper $1 Mil hoe handle. Yea, it's great and all that but I don't think it was worth the additional $1.5 Mil."
4,Not quite what I wanted,"While this is a very adequate handle, I have heard about a $5,326,667.00 handle out there that is supposed to be perfect So I will just keep looking, who knows someday the perfect handle?"
5,Great Guide to Parenting,"I've already read the book and love it. I have four children (ages 2,6,8,12). The strength of the book lies in its offering of several practical ways to teach children to cope in a sometimes rough and tumble world. I like the exercises that teach a parent how to teach these concepts to their children. The different approaches have creative names which will make it easy for my children to remember. I like the idea of solution time and I have already tried it with my kids with good results. I highly recommend this book to any parent with young children (some of the approaches are relevant to adults as well). The stories, examples and references are also valuable. If you only effectively use 2 or 3 ideas from the book, it is well worth the price."
5,Great techniques for helping children cope with hurtful teas,"I felt ""Sticks and Stones"" was easy to read and organized in such a way as to give practical and easy to learn tools to help combat malicious teasing that can often destroy a young child's self-esteem. I found the book very helpful because it was well written and had easy to follow techniques and examples of how to use them."
5,Sticks & Stones review,"I use this with my martial arts students, as part of their training in social skills and verbal self-defense. It has been a very useful resource for us. I've had several parents and students tell me that they had used the techniques in Sticks & Stones with success. The explanations and examples are clear and easy to follow, and the role-plays are very good. I've found it very accessible, and very user-friendly. If you are using this book, be sure to work the role plays consistently, and frequently. It is one thing to understand the concepts, and quite another to be able to use these techniques under stress."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is a compilation of issues from early in the Legends of the Dark Knight series. Moench takes a crack at Hugo Strange, and looks at him from a different point of view.Less of the supervillain mad scientist, and more of the crazed nutjob variety. When Strange finds a cop that is similarly unhinged, Batman has some problems."
5,The Mighty Fall,"The Fall just released one of the best albums of their careers. Fall Heads Roll comes through on every level. The Fall is a truly unique band and incredible on so many fronts, but the pleasures inherent in The Fall are often subtle and apparent after repeated listenings. The new album is immediately breathtaking with humor, vitriol, noise, all benefited by clear punchy production. Every moment is genius and control. Finally here is a Fall disc that you can pass onto those friends who you have been trying to convert for years."
3,Has done worse can do much better,"Another Fall record...I do not know...It is actually not so bad. The problem is that despite the incredible musical diversity ME Smith has displayed over the years it does allways sound the same, with some exceptions. It is still very solid and there are as allways a few pearls included that will make any fan happy. But in a sense it is a very very commercial approach in the sense that it appeals to a very very well established fan-base."
2,ART versus communication (ART wins),"Saul Wurman is one of these artistic types who use closely spaced white on black text. The book is therefore an example of bad design and extremely difficult to read. His examples might be good, but it is hard work to read about them. The book is therefore NOT a design guide for information. However, the pictures look nice, so you may want to leave the book around if you have no other means of impressing visitors."
1,WASTE OF PAPER!,"I was very disapointed when I read this book. I am a professional graphic designer and very interested in information design. This book is a paradox. A book about information design wrapped in ugly design. It is too big, too selfabsorbed and seems to be oldfashioned too. A group og designerfriend padding eathother on the shoulders. It is not woth buying, however the book: ""Information Anxiety by the same author is great, but has ugly confusing design too, -I dont understand why!"
3,Well Researched but Rather Mundane Story-line,"Among legal drams, the stories that tend to separate themselves from the pack are those that reach outside the norms by adding unexpected twists and going down unconventional paths. Nobody Roots for Goliath is not that book, and although it is engaging at times the story about a civil case against a cigarette manufacturer feels a bit played out.The story is fairly brief and the writing is very plain resulting in a book that flows very quickly. The legalese is well researched and the characters are mostly likable. Yet the ending is quite predictable making the book rather ordinary. For its genre I'd rate Nobody Roots for Goliath in the middle of the pack; worth reading if you have the time but not the first book I'd choose."
4,Voice overs aren't his only talent...,"Michael Chain is well known within the Transfan (the Transformers, that is) universe as the voices of Powerglide and Hoist. He is also an impressive musician and singer. His tongue in cheek brand of country rock shows that voice overs aren't his only talent. Check out Micheal's ""Let Go Chase Some Women"" Cd, as well."
4,I just don't understand the bad reviews,"I don't get it. A comedy album? 1 star? Geez give me a break. And no---I am not with the band.My son's drum teacher turned me on to this band and I love them! I have worked as a disc jockey for 37 years so I have listened to a lot of music. I find the music of Gruesome Galore very refreshing. The vocals are very crisp---I can hear a lot of post Beatles John Lennon in them, as far as the phrasing and delivery of the songs is concerned. I hear a lot of Pink Floyd influences in their music as well.Everyone certainly has their own opinion, but I am certainly worlds apart from those who are ripping this album. I think the band will become quite popular here in the U.S. if people will just get a chance to listen to their stuff. GG---keep up the good work!!!!!"
4,practical,"I like how practical this book is, learn about how to find fun things to do without spending money such as visit firestation with making an appointment. plant veggies with kids in the backyard, etc."
5,Best Lens For Your Canon EOS IX Lite,"Great lens! It is versatile, quick to zoom and focuses in an instant. Prior to getting this lens, I was seriously considering exchanging my camera for another. However, after seeing the pictures taken with this lens, I am sure that I will enjoy this camera for years to come. The clarity of my pictures was greatly increased by this lens, which by the way is quite compact. And yes don't forget to buy a UV filter to protect the original lens. If your looking for a lens to buy for your Canon, then I would get this one. You won't go wrong with this."
3,Probably acceptable for most...,"This is a pretty handy lens, given it's 28-200mm range, you can capture almost any scene.However, if you're a serious hobbyist, and have a desire for tack sharp images, this lens just doesn't cut it. When I had it combined with myRebel XT, it produced images that were comparable, to slightly better than,old point and shoot. But, even with a tripod, the images produced were too soft for my liking.That said, I still think this is probably a pretty good starter lens - if you're used to the reach given by super zoom point and shoots, this is probably your best option if you don't have thousands of dollars and don't want to carry a bunch of lenses around with you.I'm selling mine and upgrading to aCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L."
5,Great zoom lens,I really wanted an IS lens but they were all really expensive. I settled for this on because the price was right and it was a Canon product. I was not disappointed with my selection at all. For an amature photographer this lens will do everything I need it to for now. I may get a wide angle lens. But I think this one will work.
5,"After using almost all the L lens, this one still has a place","This is the few non-L lens I still keep in my gear collection. The other one is the fisheye.This lens produces sharp images when you use f/5.6 for the wide angle and f/8 for the 200mm.After very careful comparison, I feel that it is really useful in shooting events when you do not need too much background blur and when you cannot carry that big 28-300mm L lens.I have used that one before and it is so big/heavy that I was totally exhausted after an 8 hour shoot.This lens is so light and small that I feel very happy about its use.Afterall, when there is good lighting, this lens can be a pleasant surprise!Overall, I recommend it!"
3,Good Overall Lens,"This is a good lens for all around shooting, especially outside. It does well in bright light but blurs badly in low light. With a tripod it does OK but this would not be my recommendation for inside or low light shooting without a flash. However for an all around carry lens at a reasonable price this is great.the zoom range makes it really nice."
4,Great lens,This is great lens that i use all the time. There is only one problem i had and that is dust. After less then a year i got one big peace of dust on the inside of the lens that cost over $100 to have removed.As long as you take care not to let this happen it is a great lens to have.
5,"Lens, great buy for the $$!!","I bought this to go with the new Rebel I bought. EXCELLENT lens, makes the camera look and feel and best of all, take photos like a much higher-end camera. Highly recommend!"
5,HOT -HOT- HOT,"NICE COMPILATION, WELL PUT TOGETHER. STRONG TRACKS MAD COBRA, MYKAL ROSE, TONY REBEL, BUNNY GENERAL, YAMI BOLO, HONOREBEL, MR. VEGAS, LUCIANO, BUSHMAN, SIZZLA, RICHIE STEPHENS ON AND ON.THE HIP HOP REMIXES ARE AWESOME, TP PRODUCTIONS IS SETTING THE TREND FOR MAIN STREAM REGGAE. PICK UP A COPY OF THIS ONE..."
5,Fresh fun with a touch of deja vu,"Cutewendy is a webcomic strip by Josh Lesnick that made me laugh for quite some time, I have read it online and got the book, which is worth it, even if my copy was one of the ill fated ""pages will fall instantly"" copies. Reading them on the web is ok, but reading them on paper is a much more pleasant experience. The plot is actually very simple, Cutewendy lives with another girl and have every type of wacky adventures, like going after the company that runs their webcomic, having Wendy arrested and got infected by a super hacker spirit, and even an Initial D parody chase scene towards the end. This is not about character development (althought there is a little), but insane and uncompromised fun. BTW, keep an eye for the next J. Lesnick comic, Girly."
5,"A great, compact, precise scale for the price!","This is an excellent scale for the price! It offers consistent readings, precision to .05g (while most similar scales only measure to the tenth of a gram), and compact size; the included case is very handy, and works as a tray of sorts. This is a slim, attractive unit, and the closing cover helps prevent accident damage or button pushing. The tare function, though basic, is very helpful, neglecting the weight of a container when measuring with one. My only gripe would be the relatively small scale surface, but this hardly is worth complaining about because any tray or container allows the extra volume/surface you need.I would recommend this scale to anyone who needs to weigh only in the 0-100g range, repeatable accuracy, portability, and easy to use functions."
1,"Worthless unit, turns off too soon","This scale is a total waste of money.The auto time out feature is so fast that after you take the tare weight you have to keep pressing the scale to keep it turned on.This makes it impossible to do successive measurements in a reasonable amount of time.The industrial design is also poor, the huge lid flips back taking up too much room and exposing their ugly white instruction label.The only good thing i can say is that it came with a calibration weight which could be useful for my next scale of some other brand.Ebay shows a lot of units for much less money with backlights and without this stupid hair-trigger auto turn off feature."
3,OK nothing special,It is alright. The plate is kinda small and the buttons are hard to access. The batteries are specialty ones so expensive to replace. I have several others I like a little better than this one.
1,Poor quality,"I have only had the scale for 4 months and have barely used and it's already broken (and not from use!)The few times I did use it, it seemed great. It is small, and doesn't weight to much, but I use it forcosmetic making, so did a great job. It's very compact and the flip top keeps the scale safe. Mine camewith 2 sets of batteries."
2,Worked well until it just stopped...,"I have not had the scale for very long at all, a little less than 2 months I believe,and have only used it 3 or 4 times. It already doesn't work-it just won't come on. If I had my paperwork I'd send it back. I'm very disappointed- I shopped around for a while to find one with good reviews that would do what I wanted. It does measure all the way down to a gram which is great but wish it continued to function."
1,Not for Food Programs,I purchased this little scale thinking I could use it to weigh food portions for meals. It is small and compact and travels nicely in the little travel pouch included. That's the good part. The scale itself just wouldn't work correctly to weigh in ounces. I returned the product.
1,Worthless...,This is not a complicated story. It is a simple story with few players. The movie could have earned five stars if it would have been presented in a simple documentary fashion instead of a thriller movie with real disturbing loud music and visual effects. Unfair to the real star of the movie who in reality warned of crisis but no one paid any attention.
4,Very Interesting...,"I think this movie/doc was really good. I found it very interesting, and easy to follow. Harry and his team sure worked hard, and I'm glad they were able to get this very detailed dvd out."
2,"great story, dissapointing doc",I was actually hoping for more on Madoff himself than to hear again just how frightened the whistle-blower was with more than a couple of filmed references to his children who are sweet but it felt like feather-bedding. I may not watch it again and I own it!.
1,Not worth it,"Important story, but this movie should have been made a 20 min documentary. The attempt to make this into a superhero story just work against it. Would prefer to watch a unbiased re-caption of the issue. Not worth watching the whole thing."
2,The Healing power of Cayenne pepper,"I was disappointed with this book because I read Sam Biser's book and Sam's book is 100% better. This recommends Cayenne in capsule form and Sam says the opposite, This guy says do not get in your eyes, and I have been using cayenne in my eyes and my vision is improving by the day, so there is a lot of contradictions."
5,Good Knife,"Sturdy blade, quality handle, and the sheath is handy as well. Black on the black is the way to go. Its a ka-bar, enough said."
5,Good choice for someone out of boot camp,"My little brother just finished Marines boot camp and this made the perfect Christmas ""gift"" for him. It was ready to use out of the box."
3,all around quality knife,"Although there are many great reviews i don't feel the need for a perfect rating. This is an outstanding tool but was NOT razor sharp as it should be.. , i have the leather sheath and feels bulky on the waist but stays secure. there is not much else bad to say. the metal is still premium product and durable and long lasting its an all around solid knife.This is a fantastic tool that i always take outdoors i would recommend it as needed for most utility work"
5,Ka-bar knife,This knife is exactly as I wanted it. Awesome product that I bought for hunting but I found out it can be used to trim branches too. If your looking for a nice sturdy knife this is the one you want.
4,My first Ka-Bar knife,"Great looking knife, excellent balance, etc. I just wish it was sharper out of box; it took some effort to get it shaving sharp."
4,Good knife and worth the price,"Received this knife on time and found it really well made. The quality of the metal and the construction feels solid.Love the locking feature of the Sheath. It makes me feel safe to carry around.I was expecting the knife to arrive already sharp but it wasn't. So I had to get it sharpened and this knife is not made to be razor sharp as the angle of the edge is step. This edge is designed to last and for heavy duty work .One thing about the black oxide coating that I will like to mention, as it just gets scratched very easily. I used it just to cut some bamboo sticks as testing and found that the knife getting all scratched up.And not sure how that will hold up with the rusting issue as this is made of carbon steel, time will answer this.But I still love it and will recommend. I am giving 4 star bcos of the knife not arriving sharp and scratching of the black coating easily."
5,not exactly as advertised,"I searched for the KA BAR 1214 tactical fighting blade, and this popped up. So I bought it at a great price, and when it arrived it was the KA BAR 1211. Small difference, and I still love this knife. For the price? You really can't beat it. Read further comments on this post for editing reasons."
4,Great Knife great price!,KA-BAR's bread and butter right here. Solid knife still a very strong steel. Hard plastic sheath is nice! Have used it for hunting and scuba diving. The only con is that it is not super sharp out of the box. Can be sharpened better!
2,Disappointing,"This is my first purchase of a much heralded Ka-Bar, I was so excited to open the package. The knife is beautiful and feels great in my hand, the kydex sheath is also very nice. The blade came as dull as a butter knife. I had read reviews that had said that the blade may need a little sharpening out of the box, but this is ridiculous, the blade is unable to cut a sheet of paper. I am extremely disappointed Ka-Bar; the knife looks great and feels to be of high quality but a knife sold as a ""fighting/utility knife"" should come with a better edge than this. I was not only disappointed, but actually embarrassed in front of my friends when I opened up this very dull knife. I sincerely hope I just got a bad apple from the Ka-Bar bunch as the brand has an excellent reputation preceding it, unfortunately, I could never recommend this knife to anyone looking for a sharp blade out of the box."
5,Hoorah !,"This kife is awesome. Every American NEEDS one ! I like the knew design, just wish it had a bayonnet lug."
5,my new hunting knife,"i was looking for a fixed blade quality hunting knife and if the metal holds up under usage and sharpening i think this will be it until i'm too old to hit the woods anymore. it seems to be quality crafted but as with any knife metal, the only way to evaluate it is to use it and see how fast it dulls and resharpens. i don't like the plastic sheath though and would prefer something leather so i'll look into replacing that part someday. nothing against the sheath but plastic isn't my bag baby!"
5,One of the best knives on the market,"Everything about this knife screams zombie apocalypse, but in all seriousness it's incredible. The quality of this thing can not be beat, and the fact that it says USA on the blade makes it even better. I tell anyone who is in the market for a nice fixed blade to go with ka-bar because it is without a doubt the best you can get."
4,Great.,"The knife came on time and was boxed nicely. The knife is very nice, sturdy, and balanced very well. The sheath is also very nice. The only problems i have is the carbon steel blade just feel way to soft. Everytime i sharpen it, it eats the metal(yes i know how to sharpen knifes). But other then that its perfect. ALso Ka-bar customer service is GREAT!"
5,KABAR QUALITY USA MADE,"ANOTHER GREAT PIECE OF USA MADE QUALITY...MARINE, NAVY, AIRFORCE USE EM, HAD ONE IN THE CORPS PREVIOUSLY, CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE GOOD DEPENDABLITY AND QUALITY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONESHARP, AND SOLID AND LIKE MACHETE FOM ONTARIO, AND SP8, LIFETIME WARRANTY NO HASSLES"
5,Excellent Hiking/Camping/Survival knife,"Well-balanced blade, comfortable handle. Only time will tell how durable it is and how well it holds an edge. But at least my initial feeling about this knife is it will make a useful tool for backwoods hiking/camping trips."
2,Should have been Named How to Build a Building,"A terrible book. I thought I was reading a book on Architecture and how to build buildings and or cities. The only adventures this author saw was looking out of a window or walking around some ruins that he was trying to make exciting and the only things that kept us out of the Atomic War. This was not an adventure, but a boring trip down a college Architectural course."
2,Boring - should have been much better,"Tom Vanderbilt would love to be an architect. He's constantly critical of 1950's architecture - wherever he finds it.With surprisingly little technical knowledge, he tours testing grounds and bunkers. But it's not all Atomic America: he has the same commentary towards Arcosanti and Biosphere. Where I yearn for a storyline, he delivers watered down architecural critique.Vanderbilt's writing seems to follow this algorithm: Begin a paragraph using a sentence with an odd phrase in quotations. Then refute this with an academic argument. The first dozen times are fun. A whole book written in this style is tedious.The 1950's nuclear crazyness presents a rich lode for research. The subject (and readers) deserves much more."
5,awesome,"this song is the best! i loved listening to it in ""American Werewolf in Paris"". My suggestion is to buy this cd because you will never regret it."
3,Good book,Business as usual from Bill B. So much of the book is common sense that everyone knows and uses already etc. Sometimes you can get a bit lost in it and it gets a bit boring. The content is good but no new secrets or amazing insight etc etc. Most of what you already know in a nice well written book.
4,"GREAT VALUE, GREAT COMBINATION OF FEATURES","Looking for a reasonable price camera with up to date features? This camera is great for beginners, or a camera buff that wants something practical. Small, great for your pocket on trips. Great combination camera at a price that is not too high for your loved one that wants to try new things but also may have a tendency to loose things. Zoom, infrared autofocus, panoramic switchable, landscape mode, timer and more."
4,Good covers and mediocre covers,"Well, where to start. First of all, this is one of the better cover albums I have ever heard. Usually you buy one and only 2 or 3 of the bands stick out. On this one, I recognized all 13. They range from good covers (Vader and Diabolic) to mediocre (Behemoth). This album is worth the money just to hear Excommunion's version of ""God of Emptiness"". Morbid Angel's version frightened me a little bit (The voices and bass/guitar interplay) but this version scared the living .... out of me. The voices they used where unbelievably horrifying. This album will help new Morbid Angel fans appreciate the older stuff and help anyone interested in hearing these bands conjure up some opinions. Good album!"
1,Don't buy this get the official one,"Unofficial s.guides dont work, they have inadiquit and/or wrong information. Only get official s.guides trust me."
1,Don't buy it!,"It's unafficial, most of the cheats don't work, and it's an over all disapointment!Take my word for , it's not that great!"
5,Blew Me Away!,"Hey Artie! (Drummer) Man, what more can I say? The CD is fantastic. I highly recommend it for any of you reading this review who have the musical likes of Boston, Journey, Blackfoot,etc...These guys deliver the gospel through cutting edge lyrics with some of the finest guitar licks I've ever heard. May God Bless your endeavors in this ministry.Bryan Tarjick Carthage, TX"
5,J.T. Hobbes cannot take the truth,"Magnificent book. It has been clear for a long time that the Gospels and the letters of Paul do not give the real Jesus. I will mention only two things for ignoramuses liked J.T. Hobbes.1. Paul never met Jesus, so why does his version have any authority?2. We know that the earliest Christians were led by James of Jerusalem, the brother of Jesus. The Gospels do not mention him and the Epistles mention him unfavorably. His group knew the most about the real Jesus and they were considered heretics.It is clear that what the churches teach is false. Prof. Robinson has constructed what Jesus was really about from the Q source. Even Robinson, however, should acknowledge that whatever Jesus intended and hoped for were defeated -- both by his death and lack of resurrection and by the churches which claim him."
5,Best album I have heard in a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Until the Ends newest cd Let the World Burn is simply amazing. I didn't think they could top Blood in the Ink, but somehow they managed too. These guys are incredible. Their new songs are longer, heavier, and have some of the best breakdowns I have ever heard. Every hardcore fan needs to own this album!"
4,Nice collection for Argento's maniacs,"Very nice set of less known movies by Dario Argento - a real deal for the director's fans and new joiners to the clan. Pity, that the box is not more soectacular (no inside materials), but the nice steel box compensate it a bit. Good stuff!"
2,"Started off Ok, but dies horribly towards the end.","The movie started off ok and has a good premise to work with, but my wife's comments sum this movie up perfectly. ""I feel like I walked out of the room and came back to a completely crappy movie."" I agree with some of the other comments made as well. Some of the oddball characters tend to distract from the movie even when it is still worth watching. The ending and everything leading up to the ending was horrible. There just came a turning point while watching this movie that there was no way it could save itself.I also agree with the sound factor. The entire cast seems to mumble through lines and the sound needs to be turned up during conversations, and then immediately turned back down when the music kicks in, etc.I love horror/thriller movies. I even love cheesy B movies. This movie fails to fall in to either category for me."
3,Mixed Bag of Nuts,"This box offers seems like a great deal - 5 argento films at a low price packaged together. But unless you already know these titles, beware that only two of them are desirable for your horror collection - Phenomena and Tenebre, which are both Giallo Spaghetti Splatter classics. The other three are mostly garbage. I assume, that is why they were not packages together with other great Argento films, such as Deep Red, Susprira or Opera."
3,"Schlocky, but more entertaining than I expected","The subtitled version may lessen the schlockiness of this piece, but I haven't seen it, and by all accounts I've heard that it's much better than the atrocious English dub which is offered on this disc.Anyway, the film is a fun, silly throwaway tv movie with a fair amount of nudity and violence. The lead, Elio Germano, is decent as is the suspense."
5,what a great deal! an inexpensive intro to argento and/or itailian horror,"this is by far one of the best deals i have ever found on amazon. all discs are the complete anchor bay edition complete with extras all in this steel box. 5 films, each one quite different, and each one bears argento's tradmarks. watch for broken glass everywhere and lots of insects!"
2,"Bad acting, bad filming, bad ending, boring movie","This film had some interesting moments but was basically destroyed by its terrible shot-on-video look, its stupid and confusing double-ending, and some really poor direction (ex: when the protagonist breaks his leg and repeatedly falls off his moped in the rain, the strong healthy man chasing him blatantly slows his running down to an impossible level of sluggishness to avoid catching him). It wasn't quite as out-and-out atrocious as Argento's ""Phantom of the Opera,"" but doesn't hold a candle to his newer, more graphic works like ""Pelts"" and ""Jenifer."" It's mostly just dull, and filled with stupid characters."
2,Seems like a forgettable made for TV movie.,"This is not a horror movie, more like a police drama with some graphic images. The police receive an email invitation to play online poker from some loony who calls himself The Card Player. The wager in this game is a girl he's kidnapped. Cops win and she goes free, they loose and she dies. Naturally to create some excitement the killer starts going for the police. Yawn.Good for a few chuckles (especially the music in the grand finale), but for the most part boring. My favorite scene is when some cops are looking at a map of the United States but Atlanta is located in Arkansas and Dallas is way over by El Paso!"
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good movie... it does a nice job of developing tension and suspense.The only reason we probably did not like it more was some bad acting from all but the 2 lead characters and more importantly about 35 minutes into the film we had already figured out who the killer was and the whole ""punch line"" of the movie..... so rather than being held in suspense, we were impatient for the movie to ""get to the end already"" since we already knew who & why the killer was who they were !"""
2,"Great premise, average movie...","The premise of this movie is actually pretty interesting and original. As some of the other viewers have noted and as the DVD box states, the plot revolves around a serial killer who taunts police with online video poker - if the cops lose a hand, then (oh man, I can't avoid this one) then the victim loses a hand LOL (sorry) anyway... as I said, it starts out interesting enough, but quickly loses its way. Still I would actually recommend this one for a one-time rental. I think that if Hollywood gets a hold of this one, they should be able to improve on it and make for a much better and more thrilling movie."
1,THE CARD PLAYER DVD REVIEW 1.5 / 5,"Barely gave it two stars but this film is dull. Although it took a different approach, this film had nothing there for me.Wow, a killer taking hostages for a poker game. I'm really dumbfounded other than that. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS BAD BUT NOT HORRIBLE. AND WHAT THE HELL IS WITH ALL THE DUBBED ACCENTS?IF THE VIEWER WANTS TO SEE BLOOD AND CREATIVITY, DON'T PUT THIS IN YOUR DVD PLAYER!!"
1,No Goods here,"Okay, I like Argento and really wanted to like this film, however, it is very lame. The only good qualities it shares are the piano score and the scene towards the end where the detective is killed. Otherwise, complete garbage, Argento has not done a good film since 1987 and probably will never do one again!"
2,Another dud from Dario,"It's sad when influential talents go off the boil, but everything Argento has done since Tenbrae seems to have shown all the signs of a filmmaker who has lost interest but still has bills to pay. On the good side this is nowhere near as bad as Phantom of the Opera or Phenomena. Nor is it as mediocre as The Stendahl Syndrome or Trauma - it just aspires to be that mediocre.Sleepless might have been a minor comeback - silly but with good set-pieces - but any ground gained is immediately lost with this tepid misfire. Low on gore, low on style, low on character, it's really just an outline for a movie that he hasn't bothered to fill in. Psycho killer kidnaps women and forces female cop with issues to play internet poker for their lives. Fill in the blanks film-making ensues, very dull for the first 80 minutes, almost interesting in the last twenty. But you don't need to see this film. It won't offend, it'll just bore."
4,exactly as expected,"Excellent watch, guaranteed water proof if you are very careful to keep the setting button pushed all the way in. I needed instructions to set the date, but they were very easy to read and implement. The band was very long, so I needed a tool to shorten the band, and suspected that so bought a tool,SE JT6218 Watch Band Link Remover, 5-Piece,with the watch.The date window is very small, which means I need to get the watch under a bright light to read the date."
4,good,"this watch is easy to recharge by light, and I love the style, the belt is a little long but after I ajust it fits very well."
5,Unbeatable watch,"This is a very classy, gorgeous watch. I adjusted the band on my own, and that's all I needed to do before wearing it. To get the watch started, I just placed the watch under a mini lamp. I get a lot of compliments on the watch. It's not too big and not too small. Just right. It's a beauty! Plus, I know the battery will never die because I always wear it in sunlight. Best watch ever made and owned!"
4,Great gift for ladies who should do things on-time.,"It is very precise and good looking watch, most importantly, it needs no battery change. With its price, it is BEST-BUY."
3,Watch is nice...but,"I purchased this watch for my wife for Christmas. She loved it and was very happy, but within a week the watch face had a nice scratch down the front of it. My wife couldn't think of anything she may have done that might have done it. She called the companies customer service about it, but of course, the crystal is not covered under warranty. She wore a $20 Timex for 3 years and it never got a scratch on it like this. Anyway, we are going to have to take it to a jewellers and get the crystal buffed out or replaced."
1,Disappointing flaw,"I am amazed at how many people raved at this watch. It is a nice looking watch. I would have liked it. However, seriously, do you not look at the watch and wonder why the roman numeral 6 is upside down? It shocked me when I looked at it. It isn't something you notice in the picture but it is immediately apparent when you look at it in person. I received it to day and will be promptly returning it. I cannot even believe these watches can be sold with such a flaw. Citizen should destroy them all to save their reputation. I have owned an eco-drive watch for 11 years and loved it. But when the capacitor goes bad it is almost as expensive to repair than replace. I was hoping this was the watch for me. Received it today and returning it today. Huge disappointment."
5,A beautiful and classy watch,"I bought the watch a few weeks ago. It is a very classy watch and very well made as well. I also got it at a great price. I have a very small wrist so I ordered the same time I ordered the watch, a watch band link remover 5 piece kit for $4.99 (SE JT 6218) and remove the links myself which took only a few minutes and wore it the next day. The watch fits perfectly on my wrist and the band is comfortable to wear. The roman numerals and the hands also glow in a dimly lit room. In addition it is waterproof and being it is Eco-Drive I will never have to replace any battery ever."
2,SO disappointing,"I hate that this watch did not work....love the look, but it just did NOT hold a charge. We followed the instructions to recharge it and it ended up stopping 3 different times. I could not recommend it with a good conscience."
5,Lovely!,"I have always loved Citizen's watches.I have a gold tone one that is probably about 10 years old and still looks great and runs well. But I hate having to buy batteries!This watch is very very nice. I like the glow in the dark hands and numbers, love the silver tone because all my jewelry is silver. Very classy looking! I am quite pleased with my choice.My only question is why are they shipping through USPS? That kinda fazed me just a little."
2,Only good as a dress watch,"It's a gorgeous watch, however it looks terrible after wearing it for only 2 weeks. The band and face are made of sub-par materials and couldn't even handle my desk job. It's scratched from typing!? There's a deep scratch across the face, and the whole side of the band that I rest on my desk is all scuffed up. So I'm very disappointed. Why have a battery that can last forever if the watch can't last a month? Only other thing I don't like is that the date is so small, I have to look cross-eyed to read it. The whole opening for the date is 2mm, so you can imagine how small the numbers are."
3,Just ok,"After much decision, I chose this watch over others because of the price. I, like many others, find the date hard to read unless in bright light. I'll have to wait and see how it stands up to everyday wear abuse."
5,Brtoken Trail,Item arrived on time and in great shape. Who does not like a good wrestern? Robert Duvall is always great to watch!!!!!!!!!
5,Super Movie,"Duvall at his best with a great performance by church. Great acting all around with a superb story line that ""keep your attention"". Beautiful western scenery with a good solid positive ending. Good video and sound. One of the best recent western. Entertaiing and satisfying."
4,Lonesome Range.,"A friend loaned me this little gem when she came home after holidaying in the U.S.A.If you enjoyed Lonesome Dove and Open Range you will enjoy Broken Trail and, YES, Mr Duval does his :Gus Mcrae:again.SO WHAT?It,s not as if it is a bad performance and it fits in with the pace of the film and the storyline.In reviewing a film i dont believe you should say a lot about the story as it could give people a pre-conceived idea about whats going to happen.Let them judge for themselves.Broken Trail is an easy,gentle,with some real dark moments,Western,with an unusual story,and some great performances particularly from Mr Church. Considering that most people would find it hard to imagine him in a western,he was excellent and portrayed a great, strong,silent,hero.Get the kids to bed,feet up and enjoy this Western.Davy,wesnut."
4,The story of Haythorn Ranch,"This is the story of the founding of Haythorn Ranch in Arthur,Nebraska ([...]) The founder trailed 500 head of horses from Oregon to start the operation which today is known for their excellent stock of horses. I don't know how true the details are but the story is based in reality and you can visit the place today. The current proprietors are direct descendents of the main character in the story and are delightful people. They not only breed excellent horses but also provide a true Western setting for weddings and events. Speaking from first hand experience."
5,an ode to the great westerns of the past,"I am a fan of westerns, but more a fan of great moviemaking and storytelling. Every once in a while comes a great western that leaves you thinking "" man this is how a western should be done"". With a great cast, story, and superb direction. Again actor Robert Duvall is at the helm of the movie ""Broken Trail"" and again he brings the story to life just as he did for ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Open Range"". Without giving away any of the details, this movie has it all. The struggles, tragedies, and the love of humanity of the men and women of that bygone era called the ""Untamed West"". See it, enjoy it, but most of all, appreciate what great moviemaking is all about."
5,great movie!,"i love this movie, running horses, picking up hookers, and defending them from the crazy bad dude at the end."
4,Broken Trail,"Broken Trail is a well produced Duvall film, not avaiable in Australia. Was very pleased to obtain it via Amazon, your service is impeccable. Not so pleased to recieve the DVD's still in USA format, but got over this by burning them into a format suitable for Australian equipment. Suggest you may take this into account when processing future orders."
4,Broken Trail-a true Western,"I recently have been enjoying Westerns, and I ordered Broken Trail. Great performances from the whole cast, and lovely scenery too. Robert DuVall and Thomas Hayden Church are terrific in this unique, compelling story--which is based on a true story. It will keep your attention with a good storyline and lots of action and even a little romance. I definately recommend this film."
4,Duval continuing at his best,"Broken trail is the stage upon which Robert Duval crafts his latest character development - an aging, wise, Western character. He originated it in Tender Mercies, built upon it in Lonesome Dove, expanded it in Open Range, and peaked it in Broken Trail. Gone are the Godfather and Apocolypse Now and other characters he developed. In Broken Trail, his craft is at a high point. He is again tough as a trail boss, cranky but loving with his nephew, and soft with the Chinese girls and women. John Wayne tailored his later career in much the same way - True Grit, The Shooter, etc., but Robert Duval is doing it better."
3,broken trail vs lonesome dove,the usual solid robert duvall performance in lonesome dove mode but stillworth veiwing.my wife usually not a western fan enjoyed the film
5,Don't forget Duvall's role in Walter Hill's Geronimo 1993,"I have not viewed this film, but have read other reviews. I realize Robert Duvall had larger roles in his named western trilogy. But he makes an excellent imprint on the Walter Hill movie of Geronimo which starred Wes Studi as Geronimo, Matt Damon as a young officer. It was a great movie and is still available. I will be getting Broken Trail soon."
2,Broken Trail Broken?,I anticipated a great movie because Robert Duvall is in it. After seeing Open Range I was ready for another great western. I was really enjoying the movie until it just up and ended after the girls were being rescued again. There they are fleeing town and the credits start rolling. Talk about being ripped.
1,Not a family movie: Nudity and Female Mutilation,"I bought this because of the good reviews, only to throw it in the trash after the first 5 minutes. I was expecting a great western but got nudity and female mutilation in the first 5 minutes. The trash is where it went and where it belongs. What a disappointment."
4,Excellant Work,This is a very good film staring Robert Duvall- one of the greatest actors ever in film history. The rest of the cast is very good also. It is an enjoyable film that depicts the harsh treatment many Americans gave Asians in the Old West. I recommend this DVD highly.
1,This movie needed a rating : R,"Sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west. Sure there were some noble men and victimized young Chinese girls, but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie. I do not find very graphic violence, nudity, and rape on the top of my must watch list. I skipped to the ending on the second disk."
5,This was an awesome movie,"I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this movie was different. It actually had depth to it and wasn't just some gunslinging western. I liked the little romance part and the way things ended between Tom and Sun Foy."
3,storage bags,"some of the bags worked well but a couple of them didn't completely hold together as time passed; however, the jumbo cube bags were just what I needed to store big items. In the future I probably will just order the cube bags."
5,Love them!,"These bags are the best way of storing things for a long time. We have a summer place which is closed up for the winter. I store all the linens, pillows, etc. in these bags along with a scented drawer liner and the linens come out smelling great. There is no musty closed up smell. The fact that the bags stack on top of each other is another plus. I tried the regular vacume storage bags and plastic bins but found that the other space bags didn't hold the vacume and the plastic bins take up too much space. These bags also have the clear window in front so you can see what inside. I'm telling everyone about this terrific product."
2,Didn't last,"Ours got a hole in it fairly soon after we got it. Liked the canvas bag attached, but ultimately the vacuum bag was not of great quality."
2,Totally Disappointed,"I bought two of these bags to store winter blankets. I had five blankets (not comforters) in one bags and that was not filled to the line. The bag did not fold flat. I am disappointed, because I don't want to pay to ship them back."
1,Split,This bag isn't large enough for a comforter. Barely holds 2 king pillows. Split on first try--not at the seams either--on the clear thin plastic body of the bag.
5,The Best!,"Love the outer canvas totes! The canvas protects the plastic and the handles are so great for moving around. I wish they came in more sizes though, as this is still a big footprint and the height is a bit too tall and doesn't fit under my bed."
5,Worked great!!,"I was a little skeptical with some of these products, sometimes they aren't what they say they are. But it worked perfect for me. I fit several items in the package and now all items aren't laying around my closet. They are neatly piled up at one small end of my closet.Definately would buy more!"
5,Works perfectly. Amazing!,"I have read the other reviews and have to say maybe its just bad luck for some. However, I filled this bag with 4 duvets and 4 pillows and when I vacuumed the air out it was reduced to 1/4 of the size. Zipping it up takes a little effort and you have to hold the vacuum nozzle securely to the hole in the bag, but other then that it took about 3 min to suck out all of the air and zip it up.I am going to purchase more."
5,Love it.,"After much research I purchased this product. I am very satisfied with it. It works properly and stored 2 comforter sets, 2 sets of sheets and 4 small pillows. Perfect. I will be ordering more!"
3,doesn't hold air for more than a few days,"OK for short term use (days not weeks). I put the comforter in the bag and under my heavy king size bed. Within 1-2 weeks the bag is getting bigger. Now I can't get it out without lifting the bed. Short term (a few days) it's fine, it will hold its shape and it really saves space."
2,Space Bag Jumbo Tote - did not hold up to expectations,"We purchased this Space Bag Jumbo Tote to use in place of several suitcases for our family vacation trip. We were sadly disappointed that it did not even come close to the claims of performance or expectations from its description. We didn't even fill it up to the marked ""fill"" line and yet we could not get it to vacuum down to be able to secure the straps or zip the tote shut. (We tried this on several attempts with 2 different sweepers.) We ended up having to take out some of the clothing to get it to vacuum, strap, and zip shut. And ended up taking additional suitcases for the clothes that would not fit in the Space Bag Jumbo Tote. A disappointment...."
2,Good Idea Bad execution,Just got this and thought hey I'd at least give it a shot - the idea of it replacing 4 totes was the big selling point. But I tried it out and it won't even hold the stuff I had in 3 totes- more like 2!!very disapointed that this didnt help consolidate my stuff better and I had the same experience as some of the others when trying to get the space bag to fit inside the canvas cover. the space bag just doesnt fit.
2,Impossible to pack correctly,"I've used space bags to move from state to state, but I've never been completely satisfied with them. The regular space bags don't always keep an airtight seal and always shrink down to an awkward shape.I just moved to a small studio apartment and was excited that the new tote would eliminate the awkward shape that the regular bags have. The zipper is improved and so is the seal. However, I have packed and repacked my tote. I don't even have very many items in there, but I cannot get the square shape. I can't even get the outter tote to close because it doesn't shrink in a uniform shape. I have extra space on one side, but maybe its too tall...I rearrange everything and the same thing happens. No matter what I do I end up with a blob shape and nothing that will fit in the tote shape and zip shut. I guess I'll just keep trying."
3,Great when it works,"I recently purchased two of these totes and one of them had a broken vacuum valve so I requested an exchange from Amazon. When I received my replacement, the vacuum seal worked initially. I wanted to add more items to it but when I tried to reseal it, the suction did not work. I returned it to Amazon rather than requesting an exchange. I have purchased one previously and it worked fine. However, it may be worth noting that I have not re-opened that tote and tried to re-seal it. There may be some quality control issues with the product."
3,"They do the job, but can tear after several uses","Don't expect these to travel with you around the globe, after three or four uses the seals can get tears in them. Another concern for air travel is that using these, you can easily get over the 50 lb weight limit with large backs, which can cost you $25 per bag on some airlines."
1,Weird.,"This was hard to figure out. It seemed like such a good idea, but the part that's supposed to hold and stack the space bags is designed very oddly and I wasn't able to use it at all. Waste of money."
2,Vacuum Seal doesn't Work With Vacuum,"I bought mine at Wal-Mart in preparation of moving. I have a Dyson vacuum. Alas- the seal doesn't even work with my vacuum! I had to have a friend sit on it and push air out while we held the hose into the open bag and tried to seal it. As you guessed, it wasn't easy, wasn't fun and didn't make moving go smoothly. The mass obviously didn't fit in the tote either since it doesn't fit with my vacuum. So beware, you may have to run to goodwill, get a cheap vacuum and do it then. But you'd think name brand vacuums made in this century would work. By 'work with most' I figured... you know, doesn't work with ones made in the 70s. But whatever."
3,10.7 incompatible,I just wanted to let any new buyers to this game that as of March 2012 that this game doesn't run under osx lion (10.7). There are plenty of other reviews on other versions of the game (like the windows version) if you wanted to know more about this game.
4,What a Surprise,"I bought this CD on recommendation but had a low level of expectation having never heard of them before, I have to say that this CD is superb!! The songs and performance from the band have obviously been overlooked and lost in the quagmire of hard rock releases during the 80's!! Buy this CD it is the best un heard album I have ever purchased!!Shame about the production... it's a little muddy, but still dosen't detract from the quality of this band!"
3,STILL FUNNY,"In 1953, three episodes of the nation's top-rated TV show ""I Love Lucy"" were edited into a feature film, but never released. Now on DVD for the first time, it is still funny. Great comedy is timeless because it is about our universally human foibles; our dreams and desires run amuck. It's tragedy when it happens to us, but comedy when it happens to others. Lucille Ball knew that and was a brave, bold, self-effacing master of her ancient craft. Here, Ball is her crazy housewife persona with her ever-present show-biz ambitions. From Paramount. (1953, Not-rated, Full Frame, 81 minutes)"
5,More I Love Lucy!,"Great to have this piece of history. Weird to see them not as the Ricardo's, but they are comedy defined!!!"
4,Of interest to I Love Lucy fantatics,"I am an I Love Lucy fan from way back. For those of you who still watch reruns of the show and still laugh at a show you might have seen many, many times before, this is something I recommend to you. It is of historical interest also. It shows the audience coming in to the studio to see the show and includes the cast introductions of Desi Arnaz. It is reasonably priced and a must for Lucy fans."
2,A disappointment,"I thought it was going to be an actual ""movie"" but it was just several episodes put together on one CD - ones that I already have on other Lucy CD's. I sent it back."
2,it's well designed but not what I have expected,"It is a well designed backpack, I think... But the photo is very deceptive. It is huge (looks so cute on the photo... also it doesn't really give you the dimension, what's up with that?) and the color is really off green (not refreshing at all) and the worst of all, the fabric has metallic shine (that I don't like, seriously...) that is not shown on the photo at all. I think it's a good product but totally not what I have expected from the image. It's a poor advertisement that makes me mad not the product itself."
2,Who's Crying Now?,"I think most of us are. Journey was a really great band, but they seem to have lost their knack for truly great music. Red 13 isn't particularly bad, it's just glaringly mediocre. The only element that lives up to the band's past greatness is Schon's ever stunning musicmanship. That being said, the great songs just aren't there. Don't get me wrong; I'm not pining away at Perry's absence; I think Steve Augeri is a great replacement. It's the songs. Red 13 sounds like a band desperately trying to sound as good as they used to."
4,There is a God...,"I've been a Journey fan since 1978. Infinity was it. That was the pinnacle of Journey, in my opinion; from there it was a downhill decent into pop hell. Finally, after all this time, the pendulum swings the RIGHT way!ROCK ON!!! I still miss Greg though..."
1,Did you people listen to the same CD I did???,"I know we all love Journey, but c'mon!!! This is utter crap. You can hear the ""home studio"" feel from the first note of the filler ""sounds"" that start the album. If this was priced as a CD single, I wouldn't complain. I'd just say ""Ok, I think we're ready to go into the studio and actually record an album"". Maybe a couple of these tunes might be workable to put on that album. Let's get Kevin Shirley and get some production behind them.The new Journey Generations album is worth the wait. It's not Frontiers or Escape, but worthy (I think) of the name Journey. They should have named this one ""Journeymusic - Red 13""."
3,Change of pace,"Nice little EP put out by Journey while searching for a record label. No classics here but a nice change of pace from the usual Journey release. ""State of Grace"" and ""I Can Breathe"" are the best. ""Walking Away From the Edge"" is a different and better ballad than what Journey has been accustomed to."
4,Indeed the way to continue!!,"Just bought the EP and like the other comments state...it is amazing!!! Forget about the lesser production; I prefer great songs on a lesser produced CD anyday above the overproduced ones where songs don't seem to matter that much.If Journey continues in that direction, count me in again (lost intrest after the ROR release, and almost got back in with TBF).Don't know if that was the difference maker, but Neal Schon indeed should get the most input in everything Journey does. Listen to fe his Piranha Blues stuff (compared to the direction Steve P. took years ago) and you know what I mean: let rock/blues dominate and push back the poppy stuff. Only reason they don't get 5 stars on this is the complete unnecessary track I can Breathe."
5,Journey to the Future,"This cd is an excellent sign of things to come and a good direction for Journey,. The mythical guitar on ""State Of Grace""along with the strong positive lyrics brings home the point.""The Time"" combines a driving lead guitar and soulful vocalsto bring a message of love and perseverance. The highlight of the ep is ""Walking Away From the edge"". Steve Augeri's vocalsare emotional, passionate and haunting on this song."" I can Breathe"" is a strong melodic rock song withan awesome and memorable melody. This ep shows thatJourney can still rock and that it has found a beat andsoul to continue with Steve Augeri and the talented drumwork of Deen Castronovo."
4,Admirable Effort!,"From a True lifelong JOURNEY fan,this is one NOT to be dismissed.Every musician has roots,this is JOURNEY at their core,a core from which all of their music is born from.Without it,there would be no ESCAPE,FRONTIERS,CAPTURED,TRIAL BY FIRE,EVOLUTION,RAISED ON RADIO,REVELATIONS,ETC... To Truly appreciate them is to understand this crucial point.I believe they know what they are doing,and to those who doubt them I can only say,DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'!"
1,"Now I Know Why It's Called ""13""",I have always enjoyed the band Journey and this CD had potential except that it only 13 minutes of music dispersed over 4 songs. It certainly would have been a wonderful album if it was a full-sized CD. Of course the music is good but I am disappointed because they didn't think enough of their long-term fans to finish the album.
1,They have lost thier minds,"I appreciate Journey's effort to change things up, but this cd ........ Arrival was much better"
1,What is this???,"I'm a die hard Journey fan... this album blows! I even like the new guy, but this album still stinks."
1,I love Journey- but this ISN'T Journey,"I have been a fan of Journey for 25 years. I own EVERYTHING they have EVER done- pre- Steve Perry and post. That includes Arrival and this- Red 13. Journey with Steve Augeri is Bad English with someone other then John Waite at the mic. Neal Schon and Jon Cain should be embarrassed by this effort. Steve Augeri's voice is nice, but it is not Steve Perry. The song writing without Steve Perry seems contrived and empty. If Neal Schon and Jon Cain want Journey back then they need Steve Perry- DON'T waste your money on this."
1,The Magic Is GONE!!!,"This is really a sad , pathetic collection of garbage. This will never ever be put in the cd player again.. The reason there is only 4 songs is because the band has run it's course and is out of ideas.. Do not waste the money on this pile of garbage..."
1,You cannot review something you cant hear!,"I thuoght you would record either a small piece of a track, or 1 of the tracks so people would no what it sounds like. I therfore cannot give a review, or even buy it, because I dont no if it's good or not."
4,I Like This Album,"Good stuff. R&B, Soul, Blues. Strong grooves, good arrangements. Not overproduced but sounds good. Enjoyable listening. I think I'd like these guys live."
2,Not what you think,"I actually bought this new - for pretty much the same price Amazon is listing it for now - in 1994 when it was first released. This bomb out of Canada features two unknown ""singers"" murdering otherwise decent songs, making you long for a Tuesday Night Karaoke session in [pick your small town / small bar] just to hear someone do the songs better. It does make a good white elephant gift for the over 30 crowd, or a lump-of-coal stocking-stuffer replacement at Christmas for bad children."
1,Not worth it.,Someday I'll learn not to buy cheap pruners. The handle came loose on the first use. They're fine for small branches and twigs but certainly weren't made for the kind of work I had in mind. I once had a pair of pruners that lasted an entire season of cutting through thick branches--if only I could remember what brand they were! Feel free to email me if you can recommend some that will last.
2,chains that bind and gag,powerful chainsaw for dry wood...wet wood is another matter with this saw. the chain that came with the saw jumped the bar after about 15 minutes of use on the 3rd chain adjustment..you can get a better repalcement chain for it right from home depot. Also the wire coming from the shut off switch keeps working loose from vibration.it does eat alot of gas but the engine doesnt say maybe as long as the wood is dry.its an ok saw for the price.. ya get what ya pay for!!!
3,David Jardine returns.,"While this book is not the taut thriller its predecessor ""Devil's Juggler"" was, it certainly stands out from the crowd of rather bland post-cold war spy novels. We see the world of David Jardine a little more intimately this time. His characterization, as well as that of Nancy Lucco is perhaps the strength of the work."
5,Very nice kit.,"I have been using the ""Copperhill method"" for cleaning my DSLR sensors when they capture enough dust to become a problem. That only happens once every several months of heavy use though, and I was looking for a ""kit"" style solution to the problem that would fit in my camera bag, and be ready when I felt the need to clean a sensor.This little kit is a gem. It is exactly the same as the Copperhill method I have been using, but it is assembled in a nice, small zipper case that fits in a pocket on a camera bag. It gives you enough supplies to clean your sensor about 5 times.If you want to buy bulk PEC pads, and bulk methyl alcohol, you can refill the kit over and over. For it's price though, it's not a bad once per year expense to just buy a new kit.Very nice product."
3,You're paying for the bag.,"Since I didn't see it mentioned anywhere, here are the full contents of this kit: (Why isn't this in the product description?)10x Pec Pad1x e-wipe4x SensorSwab1x Eclipse (0.5oz bottle)1x Carrying bagPec Pads are normally sold in packs of 100 (10x the amount included here,) and Eclipse is normally sold in 2oz bottles (4x the amount included here.) For about the same price you'd be much better off building your own kit with far more cleaning product, unless you absolutely need this bag. Having said that, the bag does work nicely as a little self-contained cleaning kit to keep in your camera bag, and has plenty of space for you to add the larger Eclipse bottle or more Pec Pads later on to use as ""refills."" If you don't care about the bag, save yourself some money by buying the larger quantity cleaning products individually (more money to spend on lenses!)"
4,It Works,"I made the mistake of using cannned air to clean my D200 sensor. Instead of a clean sensor, I ended up with a mess. I think the liquid in the can ended up on the sensor, leaving a nasty residue. DON'T DO THAT!!My local camera shop said that the camera would have to go back to Nikon. I was leaving on vacation in a week and didn't want to leave without my camera. I went to the home page for the Digital Survival Kit and discovered that I could clean the D200 sensor with thier Eclipse solution.I followed the enclosed instructions and ultimately used 3 swabs to clean the sensor. In between swabs, I photographed a white wall to see the results. It worked as advertised. I am a believer.Different cameras and sensors use different solutions. Check the manufacturers web site before ordering."
4,It Worked,"The manufacture web site not only has instructions but an instructional video as well. Although it is easy to do, it took me three times to get it completely clean. But it worked!"
3,Ok I guess,"The swabs cleaned out the dust near the center of the sensor, but didn't do much for those in the corners. I wish there was a better option but there really aren't any others..."
