5,Super Fit in my 4Runner,"Looks great & simple install (fits inside windows, not glued to painted surface). Installs in ~5 minutes (including reading directions). Hard part was getting gummy glue off car from old glue-on visors (A bottle of alcohol & a big pencil eraser did the trick)."
3,Questions,How many channels (sp?)? XP or Vista required? 64 bit processor required? What kind of card slot required? Supports RAID 5? Rated 3 stars just because required to rate it something to get my questions published here.
4,Agree with concerns re med sch,"I used this text as a college senior heading to medical school. It didn't prepare me at all for the biochem needed in med sch. i don't have a vendetta against the books, which i liked: i had just come off a rigorous, 2 semester sequence using streiwieser & heathcock. but i fully agree with reservations about this book if you're headed to med sch."
4,"Lovely, lush, but old school","I agree with pretty much everything the other esteemed reviewers have said about these recordings. I grew up with them. They are indeed old friends! They are lush, well played and extremely well executed.They are, however, reflective of where baroque music was back in I Musici's heyday 20 years ago. This makes them wonderfully played, but probably a bit tame. So much so, I was actually quite shocked that this was the recording of these I grew up with. The pace is almost languid.There is no denying it, though, at the Philips DUO price, they remain a bargain. Other, more daring renditions have a more daring price too. So, pick your poison."
3,Outdated,"""In the not-too-distant future, people may look for jobs on computers!"" This was published in 2011. Obviously they're not making changes when they revise the editions."
2,Need to be able to read Khmer - Good for khmer people learning english,"The book seems a good instrument in case a khmer person wants to learn English. Too bad it is not clearly indicated that you need to know how to read the khmer language, to use this book. As a metter of fact I will make it a gift for a child in Cambodia."
3,"Fair Episode of a Sublime, Though Sadly Forgotten, TV Show","True fans of Horror who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s love this show. Even Stephen King, in his book DANSE MACABRE (p. 216 of the oversized paperback), calls this ""the best horror series ever put on TV.""The show's host, Boris Karloff, is obviously no stranger to the horror genre, and he co-stars in this particular episode, ""The Incredible Doktor Markesan."" The story is somewhat cliche--it basically revolves around a mysterious, defrocked professor of the medical arts and his vindictive postmortem experiments--and modern horror fans will probably be disappointed in the predictable and anticlimactic ending. Nonetheless, the episode is notable and worth watching because of the wonderfully moody and eerie performance by Karloff (as the professor) and a pre-BEWITCHED performance by Dick York (as the professor's visiting nephew)."
3,interesting but somewhat predictable plot,A newlywed couple stays in a mansion in which the owner has come back from the dead and has brought back several enemies to life as well. He has brought back these people who were on the staff of the University at which Dr. Markesan was employed. He is angry because he was thrown off the board of this school and wishes to hold his own private courtcase with the people that were responsable for his being thrown out. The story is interesting and spooky but is predictable as to outcome.
1,"Falsely advertized as 3""","Very disappointed because I thought I found what I was looking for!IT IS NOT 3 inches, as advertized, it is exactly 2.25inch in diameter. I entered asearch for a 3 inch Cast Iron Plett Pan, and the first that popped up was this one.But actually you would have to find the smallest eggs if you can find them and feed them to your family to fit in it. And even with that it would still overflow and make a mess."
2,"wounderful sonatas, questionable performance","When I found this recording in my library I was sourprised: The most beloved sonatas of Beethoven, played by a pianist I appreciate so much. How could I forget I own it?I listened again, and understood. The sonatas are wounderful, but the playing is at most OK, and these works deserve much more. Almost every piece here has at least one much better performance: I prefer, for instance Gilels for the Appasionata, Rubinstein for the Pathetique, and Barenboim for the Les Adieux. This recording simply doesn't get to me."
2,Music to Put You to Sleep,"I find Brendel's playing style washy, imprecise, sluggish, and completely without fire. In a word, boring! He is the anti-Glenn Gould."
2,"Not one of my ""favourite"" CDs","While Alfred Brendel is very popular, and said to be very good, and this CD set has many of the more famous Beethoven sonatas, this CD is terrible. The only reason I gave this two stars was because of the number of famous sonatas. Brendel's playing itself, however, is so unbelievably mechanical and ""dry,"" I don't know how anyone can like him. He uses no pedal, which I had never heard before on a Beethoven CD, and have concluded that it sounds horrible. The only reason someone would buy this would be to at least have one, fairly cheap, copy of the famous Beethoven sonatas."
3,Good Bargain,"For the price, this CD set offers fine playing all around. Don't expect any great insights or revelations, though. These are nicely thought-out, middle-of-the-road performances from Brendel that are perhaps a bit bland but quite solid for the most part. If you need performances with a little more panache, try Artur Schnabel, Sviatoslav Richter, or even Maurizio Pollini."
1,Not accurate and not one second,"I bought this thermometer yesterday at Tuesday morning for 19.99, I've tried it about 20 times and received 20 different readings on the same person, when it gives a reading at all. The batteries that come with it are useless. I'm probably going to return it. When my grandson has a temperature, it's going to be too frustrating to not know if the thermometer is accurate, from 99.8 to 97.6 to 98.4 to 96.7 within less than a minute. That's too much of a variance to be reliable. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Great concept, but","The choice of songs is inspired. The arrangements and execution of the instrumentation are simply lovely and wonderfully accessible, gentle, and baby-friendly overall. BUT, the vocalist has a noticeable sinus issue, and the recording is so unbalanced that you can barely hear the instruments, only her stuffed nose voice. To be fair, the singer has excellent phrasing, tonality, and warmth, and I can see how the CD made a special gift to a friend. However, it's probably not a good idea to buy because you or the recipient of your gift would have to listen to the voice of a good singer with a sinus infection over and over and over. I'm truly surprised that she didn't redub it giving it better balance and a healthy voice before commercial release."
3,45 min. is never enough...,"Liquid Television was one of the very first animation shows that aired on MTV, and cetainly probably one of the best. It's were Aeon Flux, and Beavis & Butt-head first got it's start, and for the most part the first video mainly focuses on the Aeon Flux's claim to fame with 4 of her original episodes.Which is ok, but if you are buying this video for her, you might as well just get her full length video from MTV instead. Whatever happend to winter steel, or dogboy, or even beavis and butt-head's first skit? Well this maybe a good collection for those of us who forgot to tape it while MTV was airing it, but it certainly cant get all the best of's in one 45 minute tape...."
4,4 stars for trying....,lt tryed but didnt catch up with the fans...id recomend getting the actuall series like aeon flux the maxx wich are prity hard to find. I think they ran out of print for aeon flux......By the way has any one here ever heard of an old mtv 30 minute animated series for adults called Cartoon sushi? It came out in the middle of 98...just wanderin when they might come out with a vhs or dvd......but give this video a try if you can find it..
3,"goood, but not the best.","sigh. another tape from mtv, makers of The Maxx and Aeon Flux, comes another confusing concotion of crazy crap. not the worst tape around. and well worth the 11 some-odd dollars thier charging. if you enjoy the stuff mtv puts out."
2,has it's merits,"This play, which I also had the fortune to see performed by Linda Griffiths, has it's merits. There are wonderful moments where it seems as though It really is Gwendolyn who could be speaking the lines on the page. But on the whole, you get more of an inside glimpse of MacEwan by reading her own work, rather than through Griffiths' play. It is a good attempt, but anyone who has read much of Gwendolyn MacEwan's work will likely be disappointed, as more of the writer's self-indulgence is visible than MacEwan herself. but it does pay a tribute to this often neglected brillant Canadian poet."
3,Great for the job.,"I don't use a pastry blender much, but this one is to replace my 52 year old blender which did not work well."
2,Handle spins,The handle spins because the screws on the side don't secure it properly. Not something I want to have to retighten each time.
3,A Little Bendy,"OVerall, pretty good, but the blades are a little too bendable. Handle and grip are fine as well. Certainly does the job."
3,Pastry Blender,"It's fine, it does just what it's designed to do. Nothing fancy.Keep the word requirement and I won't rate any more of these things."
1,Buy a different one,"I bought this in November--by December it was already broken and useless. It's not like I was using it in a commercial setting! I made about four pies before the handle began to turn. The screws move, making it difficult and uncomforable to use. It's poor preformance is the reason I'm back on amazon, looking for a new one. Don't bother with this cheap thing!"
2,Pastry Blender,The blender itself would be fine expcept the handle keep comeing apart every time I use it. The screws rotate with pressure and it comes apart when using.
4,Pastry Blender,Just what I wanted. Someone saw me using mine and wanted one. Couldn't find in stores so ordered here. Good delivery.
5,As good as it gets,"Cataldo is as good a CD as you can imagine for beautiful, heart-felt, yet manly acoustic music. I must have played this CD in my car's player for two months straight through the winter. Check it out and you won't be disappointed."
1,Photo Printing Problem,"This book was borrowed from the local library and the color photos impressed me greatly. The book I ordered and received from National Book Warehouse was exactly the same as the library volume but the quality of the cover and all photos was unacceptable to poor; it was printed in Hong Kong by a Japanese firm and not by Viking-Penguin.I paid a bargain price, but, given the poor quality, it was a ""bad buy."""
4,amazing voice,"Most of these songs are ""covers""....Sally covers a Loudon Wainwright song ""The Picture""....beautiful song...amazing voice...wonderful match!!I love the song so much I played it at my wedding.Its a very good album if u want some nice mellow music from someone with an amazing voice..very talented!"
3,"Great markers, terrible price","As far as the markers go I give those five stars, wide color range, the double end allows one to draw 4 different lines & Prisma uses a low odor alcohol as solvent, so they don't have the harmful stink of old type markers. But I have to say the prices charged by all Amazon sellers are very high compared to other online art companies."
3,Not bad,It's a little difficult to color small areas (the fine point makes the colors look uneven) and the overall color tone is a little uneven as well...Not bad markers though.
3,It's ok but....,"Prismacolor art markers are supposed to be high end professional markers, not great like Copic markers but can pass as good if you are in a hurry. If you really want more subtle blending and control of colors/hues it will be expensive to purchase the entire 156 color set. But Copic is a way better product and has more options of application. Do some research and find which art marker works for you-and your wallet."
4,Markers bleed,"Thus far I believe these are some solid markers but they don't go well with some sketch books so if you have very thin pages in your sketch book like I do then don't plan on using these in it, instead use faber castell Pitt pens they don't bleed through your pages. If you have thicker pages that you are working on then these are probably going to be fine and that is where I find that they are meant to be used, but overall the marker quality is very good and I would recommend them to people who are trying to be marker artists."
3,Disappointed,"I have used prisma colors before, paint, and pencils. Each where true to the color on the label. These markers are not. My peach color does not look peach but more of a pink. They look nothing like the colors that are on the labels themselves, its like whoever filled my set filled the ink with a different color than what was on the label. I will now have to buy an additional set of skin tone markers for my characters. I wish I would have just saved myself the money and would have kept doing my drawings on the computer like I have done in the past. I bought these because it was a good deal and I thought it would be nice if I turned in some hand colored items instead of just computer generated items. I think I will stick to the computer generated items, at least I know what color the color on the computer will turn out. Highly disappointed with this purchase."
2,Is that the best you could do?,"Don't buy this book, it just ain't worth it. It reads like Gatusso just read articles about Seinfeld, watched commercials with Seinfeld actors in them, watched too much Seinfeld, put all these things into a book, and added his own worthless opinions. This book is a waste of money. There's a new Seinfeld book out, buy it instead."
3,Not Available Anymore?,"Amazon.com has just informed me that this book is no longer available. What gives? It is only one year old. Come on Amazon, this is very poor."
3,Decent Offering,"I think this book will benefit me in my secular work more than the ministry, but it is a decent work. It is well written and easy to read."
1,Disappointing overall,"I found one chapter that contained two sentences of useful information - that was it. In the remainder of the book, there were attempts at humor that failed. The book treats some serious issues flippantly. A waste of my money and my time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,The Patient from Hell,"The author presents some good techniques for dealing with serious illness. However, I think that his attitude about medical tests and lack of certainty about the results of medical practices colored some of his comments."
2,The Patient From Hell,"Not well written, I flipped past pages of dialog, opinion , politics(global warminng?) cutsey remarks and lots of attitude to find nuggest of facts. We all cheer his successful treatment, no doubt about that, but thanks to modern science, certain facts in his experience are already out-of-date and no longer in use. My oncologist listens to me and all options are on the table. Why Mr Schneider needs cudos or takes credit for changing procedures at Stanford University Teaching Hospital by simply talking to his oncologist is beyond me. Since I had purchased the book, I wrote a book review in the cover and donated it to the bookcart at the cancer center where I am treated. O.K. reading."
4,coping with illness,"Schneider's book is a helpful introduction to handling an illness that is more than a cold. It would be hard to emulate his assertiveness but there are some lessons. Take an assertive friend with you when seeing a medical practioner. Make a list of your questions then make a copy to send or give the medical practitioner. Ask your friend to note the answers. Search the web for details of your condition. If your medical practitioner has lost the power of communication, find another. And if you are uncomfortable get a second opinion. There is a lot in the book. You don't have to have the same illness. There lessons are universal."
3,Inconsistent fabric weight,"I bought two of these shirts in black and found them to be just what I was looking for in a shirt. I then placed an order for a grey and a navy blue. When they arrived they were of a lighter fabric than the black. While I did keep the two latest purchases, I was not as enthused with the shirts as I was with the two black."
1,TRUST!,If you say it's 100% cotton then it's supposed to be 100% cotton. The tag in the shirt says different.I don't have the time to send things back!How about some quality control in advertisement.
1,Russell Pro Cotton Tee Mens,"You advertised Russell Pro Cotton Tee Mens but you sent me Russell Cotton Performance, this is a cheaper tee and does not fit as well. I was not happy at all with this purchase and will not buy again."
2,No Longer Worth the Price,I have purchased Russell Athletic Performance Tees for years and have always been quite happy with them as they were the heaviest cotton I could find for gym workouts. This new shirt has the same name but is not the same heavy duty cotton. Russell has clearly cheapened the product to save cost. It is no longer worth the premium price. Land's End heavy duty tees are heavier weight cotton and less money.
1,Never again...,"These are undoubtedly the worst t-shirts I've ever paid for! I was looking for replacements for some ""vintage"" style t-shirts that I had previously purchased from Wearguard and that are no longer being carried by them. Despite having good luck with Russell Athletic apparel in the past, these shirts are a SERIOUS disappointment and a waste of money. The neck band rolled within the first five minutes of wear and the shirts began to pill after the first washing. The ironic thing is that there were no less than three separate inspector tags taped to the inside of the shirt! Russell needs to spend less time inspecting third-rate merchandise and invest more money in quality. Do not buy these unless they are on clearance and you need some wipe rags for your next car wash."
1,Sun faded,These shirts were left out in the diret sunlight for an extended period of time. They're all faded out! They are a darker in color under where the stick-on size tag was attached. The tag happenes to be stuck on the chest area so it's very noticable. Save your money and buy from a reputable store.
2,Not even cotton!,I bought 4 of these t shirt and they were not all cotton. They are not what was advertised and not as they used to be. These are not worth the price.
4,tee shirts,the tee shirts i bought were exactly what was described and they have kept their shape. i would buy more.
4,"Poorly manufactured, but works well with small fix.","I initially left a negative review for this product, but i've come back now to update...Water would continuously drip. I found that there were excess pieces of plastic at the rim of the bottle, that were not trimmed away when the bottle was pulled from the manufacturing mold. These pieces were preventing an air-tight seal from forming when the cap was installed. I trimmed the plastic with box cutter, and the bottle now seals well, and does not leak at all.If you have any problems with leaking, be sure to check this!"
3,Ok if it came with the lid seal,"Bottle arrived in sealed package but had no seal for the lid. It leaked around cap even after fastening lid tightly. I shipped the product back and am still waiting for a refund.These bottles also tend to leak from the spout (around the ball), but I knew that before purchasing. Does not really matter because I install the bottle over the dogs' food bowls anyway. I do like that these bottles come with a sturdy spring to attach them to the cage rather than a wire holder."
1,Leaks,"I read some reviews that it leaked but took the chance. Yes, it leaks non stop out of the tip. I returned it. It holds much more water than I had expected it to."
4,Slacker Jesus: Falls short of expectations,"I expected more from Society 1, but I guess they were limted by the ratings system. Hardly any live footage, but some cool behind the scenes. If you are a Society 1 fan I would recommend this vid. buy it buy it already!!"
2,Leyse professinal elecric fry pan,"This frying pan is a good size, but food sticks to it and it is very hard to clean. The handle on the cover gets very hot and now after less than 6 months of use the bottom is bubbling. I think it is very poor quality for a frying pan that cost $l00.00. I do like the stainless steel handles on the frying pan itself, they stay cool and won't break off."
2,Leyse customer review,"I recently purchased this. The top handle that I pick up gets very hot to the touch. Unfortunately, this is a safety issue and I find this a manufacturing defect. The product would be fine except for this issue. I will be returning the product in exchange for another."
5,Leyse,"This cooker works very well as a slow cooker as well as a fryer and general all around electric skillet. The thermostat seems acurate to what the listed temperatures are on the probe. But use it as a slow cooker when you are home and can keep an eye on it. I love mine. I do not use grease it it, I use spray. And it is big enough to cook really large roasts. Seasons up nicely."
2,Wrong Product and Construction,I ordered this Leyse 31101 Electric frying pan that was supposed to be constructed of 18/10 Stainless Steel but actually was made of 18/4 material. The manufacture stopped making 18/10 sometime ago. I returned the product and was happy to receive my entire purchase and shipping costs. Thanks
3,Ein Interressant Third Period German Class,"Being in my third year of German, and living overseas in Bonn, I have come to appreciate the culture and the music. My German teacher frequently plays Die Arzte in class as I way of livening things up a bit, I presume, because endless hours of discussing ""der, die, and das"" becomes more than a little redundant. 'THe Doctors' are a great addition to my cd collection."
4,"Schöne Platte, gute Musik, aber dähmliche Texte.","Berliner Knabe tut Meinung kund.Diese CD ist zwar ein Ohrenschmaus, aber das Niveau der Texte ist erbärmlich. Da haben die Ärzte meiner Meinung nach schon bessere Platten abgeliefert. Allerdings kann ich sie deshalb allen nicht deutsch-sprechenden Musikfans, egal ob Punk gern gehört wird oder nicht, wärmstens empfehlen. Schade das es nur diese CD hier zu kaufen gibt. Die beste Platte von den Ärzten ist nämlich ""DAS BESTE VON KURZ NACH FRÜHER BIS JETZE"" (Sony). 34 Songs, die auch den Intellekt des deutschen Fans fordern."
4,Great for Campfire or Girl Scout Groups,"This is very informative, step by step procedures to make practicle candles for for many age levels. Instructions are clear and precise, giving caution and tips when needed."
5,Awesome!,What a great way to recycle! I love candles-and this is something I can put together on a day with my grandkids. And what great gifts they can make to give to their parents-something they made.
2,Library Book Received,"I didn't like the idea that the book was a library book. I could not determine if it was purchased from a library or simply taken. The library indicators were printed inside and outside of the binding, visible to everyone. Trying to remove the labels damaged the binding. I would appreciate it the description made mention of the labels."
4,Pretty Colors and Lots of Them,"My niece loves to color and these markers are perfect for her. The pack has a lot of great, vibrant colors and best of all, they are washable! Just in case..."
2,NOT SCENTED,"I'd suggest passing on these markers... can't smell anything:( I purchased the RoseArt scented markers at the same time... if you are looking for good smelling washable markers, those are the better bet."
1,Ridiculous,I am just starting this book and already it is a turn off! i like ghetto fabulous books as much as the next black person and i am also very versatile as far as books go but this one is so ridiculous I wouldn't recommend it to any one!
1,Prada -- dose not smell like the real thing,I order this for my mom for Christmas. She used the perfume and had to wash it off. It has a chemical smell to it. Very disappointed and obviously not the real thing. Guess I need to go to a department store!Prada By Prada For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray Refillable 2.7 Ounces
1,How old is this? It is used?,"At about half the normal price of this perfume, I guess it's not that big of a surprise that this is not the same product you might purchase from somewhere else for over $100. For starters the box was not wrapped in cellophane the way a new box of this perfume would be wrapped at a reputable store. The spray nozzle with balloon attached was dirty and tarnished. Moreover it was missing the little plastic tube that goes down into the perfume allowing you to spray it. Finally the perfume had kind of an alcohol smell, the way perfume gets when you've had it for too long. I don't think it's worth the $50 (or I now see the price has gone up to $60) for what appears to be old/used perfume. Go somewhere else and pay the extra $50."
5,i LOVE it,"if you like an ""oriental spice"" scented parfum, then this is for you. i love it, the atomizer is great. similar too the following scents - euphroia by Calvin Klein, the new Usher for women, Chanel Mademoiselle. This is a classic scent for a true lady."
5,Love My Prada,"I was really happy to find this Eau De Parfum Spray for this price. The photo assured me that it was the correct fragrance. I have great confidence in purchasing from Amazon, so I went ahead with the online purchase. I love it and will buy from them again."
2,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with this product after opening it. I could not smell even a hint of garlic, unlike Gaia brand, and since garlic has a very strong smell even in small quantities. I question if there is even a therapeutic amount in the bottle I received...if any at all."
1,Way to expensive,"Although this lighter is probably pretty good, you can get one for much cheaper somewhere else. Just google ""lantern lighter"". The first 5 results I got were the same or similar product (...)."
4,Captain underpants book o fun,It was used and warn but the discription forewarned of that so I knew to expect it. There were still lots of pages untouched that we were able to enjoy. Good price and good description
4,Good seller,"The seller was good. I got the order quickly. Amazon did not list the book as used though, so the seller refunded my order. This was no fault of the seller."
3,"Captain Underpants, but....","Kids love the series, but like it says,""book o'fun"".My kids didn't find this one as ""fun"" as the actual stories."
4,for my son,my son loves this series. he was shocked when i got him this book. he read it numerous times. i dont think he will ever be sick of it.
5,Get your boys to read,My boys have always loved to read but they cannot put down theCaptain Underpants books. They are a big hit.
2,Captain Underpants,"As my two grandsons like the Captain Underpants books, I bought some as a birthday present. A quick look at the contents left me very disappointed and the main reason for that is that the character's words are so grammatically incorrect, they made me shiver. How can these books be educational for young children, when all they learn is incorrect grammar!!!! It seems to me that they would have had more educational value if the correct words had been used. I wish that I had reviewed these books before buying them."
1,Couldnt tell you,Since I NEVER received the book I cannot comment on it! I received no contact from the company nor did I receive a credit to my account
2,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"My son loves the books, so when we bought this one, we thought it would be a real winner. We were, unfortunately, wrong. The problem is that it is an activity book whose pages unbind and drop out too easily, and it is not a good size for laying down and writing in or drawing in. Because it is the same size and binding type as the ""reading"" books, it just doesn't lend itself to being an ""activity book"".Content is fine and right in line with the other books. I just think the execution is lacking."
5,Hey at least they are reading? Right?,"My 8 yr old is usually glued into one of these books, I have read them and I guess you really have to be young to get into them, they are truly silly to the point of no return.But, hey, as long as they are reading! She gobbles every Captain Underpants book she gets her hands on and the charter school she attends hands them out for reading so many books per term.Good reading for kids!!!"
2,Lifeless,"Brendel plays these pieces as if he's bored to death, especially in the (otherwise) gorgeous first movement of the B-flat Major sonata. Grigory Sokolov, Clifford Curzon, and Artur Schnabel are much more adept at sculpting that piece; Sviatoslav Richter offers a very deliberate but heartfelt approach. For the C Minor and A Major sonatas, try Wilhelm Kempff."
3,Reflective band for walking in the evening,"Arrived promptly and well made. Unfortunately, they are to short and do not reach around my arm with garment adequately."
4,Great reflective. Be aware of chafing,"I use it on my bike, no problem there.Then to run, I used it on my ankle and got a nasty chafingAlmost couldnt race a 6.21 race I hadAfter that, I snap it on my wrist or my hand, runningSo be careful where you snap it.the reflective is great, you'll be seen"
5,Bright and right,"The bands are highly reflective. Very nicely made. Don't know about being ""leg"" bands. They fit my forearm well. They are well made and look like they will last. A very good addition to the nighttime visibility ensemble."
3,Packaging is different than product,"The description says ""Reflective Bands"" and doesn't clarify arm or legs BUT the packaging says ""Leg Bands"".These clearly are NOT leg bands. I have small legs and they barely fit around my calves. They also say ""Adjustable Hook & Loop Fastening"" but there is none of that, just velcro. It appears that this product is different from what the packaging says.I am happy to wear them on my arms but I think the manufacturer needs to change the packaging."
3,okay,"I got these for my husband to use when he runs at night. They are nice and reflective, but when I walked behind him I really couldn't see him. Maybe with several lined up together..."
3,Too short,Should've listed to the other reviewers and bought the longer product. But I thought my skinny ankles would be small enough. NOPE! Too much trouble to send it back so I'm keeping it and just velcro-ing the 2 together.
4,Great!,"These are great! Could be a bit longer, as I prefer to wear them on my arm, they just reach for me, could be a problem for someone more muscular. But reflect well, velcro works great! My whole family of runners use them."
2,"who are these made for, pixies?","These are reflective all right, but I'm not sure who they are designed to fit. I have average-sized arms for a woman, not that big, but the bands BARELY fit around my arm. I have to squeeze my arms somewhat, and forget it if I'm wearing a thicker, warmer top for running in cold weather. I can't see how these would fit most men at all."
3,Gets the job done but workmanship is crude,"I like that this was made with apparently American raw materials however I find the stitching to be crudely done.The reflective plastic material is sewn onto a crunchy piece of velcro nylon, and the sewing was too close to the edge so that the reflective material is about to come loose on some sections.The nylon base strap material is hard and can be scratchy if you velcro to tight. I loosely wore around my ankles and after run there was slight skin impressions. Perhaps after a few washings it might soften up."
4,Meh,"The bands are very reflective, and seem to be of pretty good construction, but they could be a little longer. Heavy pants and socks make for a tight fit."
4,Small bands,"These reflective bands are nice for keeping your pants from getting tangled in your chain while riding a bike, but they would not fit around my ankle when I am wearing boots. Seems stupid, but I wear boots when I am on call for my volunteer Fire/EMT position, and I still like to ride my bike, so it was a bummer they didn't fit while in my uniform. I guess they also wouldn't work if someone had rather large calves or ankles."
4,Excellent reflective qualities,"Great for a small dog, great reflective qualities. Probably would be a little better if the width was narrower, but that is just specific for my little 12 lb. dogs."
3,"Ok leg bands, but the velcro seems pretty flimsy","Pros: the reflective material works great.Cons: Velcro appears to be flimsy, and looks like it wont last long. The bands are relatively small, I was hoping to be able to strap them around my upper arm, but they do not fit. They do fit my ankle. The bands did not look the same as in the picture. The ones I received are only about 0.75"" wide not 1.5"" wide."
2,Very tiny,"Both picture and the spec are misleading on the size of those bands. I just received it and was suprised how tiny they are. As far as I can tell, the reflective part is just about 1cm wide (about 0.4""). Also they are obvious too short for legs."
2,To small for around arms,"These are well made and very reflective but there is no normal sized human being whose arm/bicep these are going to fit around. Not even close. And forget it if you want to wear them over a jacket. These need to be at least 3-4"" longer. The velcro placement does allow two straps to be put together and used as one bigger band but there is not enough velcro to allow for adequate size adjustment. Better to call these wrist or ankle straps."
3,Jog-a-lite reflective bands,"These fit my upper arms over a long-sleeved shirt and definately seemed to reflect cars' lights (I walk and run at night). I can make them smaller if needed. They did seem a little flimsy however, I don't think this will effect use and wear. I would have given them 3 1/2 stars if it had let me."
3,Plasticland - 'Salon' (Pink Dust) 3 1/2 stars,"Looks to be this Milwaukee four-piece neo-psychedelic band's 4th album. This twelve track effort certainly makes for good listening, but I've heard their other releases are, in fact better. 'Salon' is decent '80's psychedelia, I thought. Personnel: John Frankovic(see my review of his solo CD on Brainticket Records)-bass&vocals, Dan Mullen-guitar&vocals, Glen Rehse-organ,piano&mellotron and Vic Demechei-drums. Almost sure to give plenty of aural pleasure to fans of early Pink Floyd, Asteroid #4, Deviants, Pretty Things, Pink Fairies and possibly Let's Active."
2,Why Joseph Smith???,"I thought I was buying a book on nutrition...why all the talk of Joseph Smith? The Greatest American Ever To Live?No to Joe Smith, No To Polygamy - Yes to eating nutritious food. Amen."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD FROM AMAZON,"I ordered this DVD set from Amazon and when it arrived, it was supposed to be 3 DVD's, but I got 2 Disc 1's and 2 Disc 2's and NO disc 3...They sent out a replacement and that set had the SAME problem. They took it off the site for a week and now it's back up as only containing ONE DVD...I don't know if it's the shipment Amazon got or not, but beware..."
2,Hawthorne season 1,"I have nothing but respect for Jada Pinkett as an actress, but this show sucks, I don't know how it lasted one whole season. I watched one episode and barely made it through. If you work in the medical field you will know that her actions are senseless and not in the best interest of the patient. If you don't work in the medical field then you will know this show really doesn't make any sense. I hope Jada pinkett can get some more roles like she had in the 90's but this is far form those."
2,Hawthorne: The Complete First Season,"I enjoy this actress and interesting to see her in a series rather then movies. With the Medical TV series on offer, tough to compete in."
3,Not so much,A nurse Jackie want to be not done as well at all. I only got through 2 shows the lead character is over acting big time. Would watch if there wasn't anything better on but there is plenty that is better
2,puerh tea,"I don't like the taste of this tea; however, I am not a big tea drinker. A friend told me about it and thought I'd try it, but it is not for me."
4,Pu erh tea,taste was very good. Was good either hot or cold. I prefer ice tea. I would recommend this tea. I plan on using it alot.
3,Nice and solid.,"This is a nice quality product, but it is bigger than what I was looking for. My molds are a lot smaller in diameter. It is my own fault for not looking at them closer."
5,Very nice and confortable shoes!!,This is my first pair of adidas shoes because I am usually a Nike and Reebok fan. They are very cool and look great with almost anything!
4,Comfy Shoes,"This is my second pair of Adidas Gazelle shoes, and they are the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned. My last pair has lasted 4 years, and are still going strong. Great shoe!"
4,Classic adidas kicks.,"They look and feel old school. I wore these through New York all day as I walked around and scoped the attractions. My only complaint is that the tongue of the sneakers makes them squeak if you tie them tight. Other than that, this is a very stylish and comfortable shoe."
4,great adidas originals,Gazelles are an icon o adidas .these are great they fit nicely look cool and are an all around good shoe .the only thing i changed was i put in dark blue laces with the white laces theres just too much white for me .
5,great purchase,thanks Amazon. my father got the great birthday gift!he had same shoes when was a student.nice old classic style. nice materials.very comfortible shoes.
4,Comfortable,"Not really what I was expecting. I'm more used to the skate type, casual, adidas shoes. I guess these are ""soccer"" shoes. Still...very lightweight & comfortable. Amazon delivered on time as usual. I was actually surprised at how fast I got these!These shoes look & feel nice. I'm just a little worried about the cushioning and support. Haven't worn them long enough to review but...hopefully they will hold up. I own about four other pairs of adidas so...I have good faith in them."
5,love these kicks,"Man, ive been looking for these sneaks for YEEEAARS lol , but yeah.....so i saw them and ordered them...and BAM, i got me some awesome sneakers !!! packaging was great, came in like 4 days, and with shipping n handle'n it was still cheaper to order em online here then paying for some adidas that arent really the ones you want in stores. buy them !!! NOW !!!! O.o"
4,Squeaky!,This is a nice shoe. Not quite as comfortable as the Samba series but not bad. The tongue is made from the squeakiest material ever! You won't be able to sneak up on anybody.
1,Why does Amazon keep deleting the one star reviews?,"You should always take any Amazon ""rating"" and subtract about 2 stars since they delete the unfavorable reviews and let the authors write many 5 star reviews under different names and post them.This is the third or fourth reveiw I've written for this book. It is esentially a collection of late night TV commercials so save your money. You might also do an internet search on the author's name before buying."
2,Not for beginners,"If you enjoy watching get-rich-quick late night TV, by all means, buy this book. For the rest of the real investers, go do a Google search on the author's name. Spend a few minute researching before spending your money. I did the research and brought the book anyway, because I want to see what Whitney has to say. It turns out a lot better than I had expected. I think he copied a little here and there from other books.I would not recommand this book to beginners, because they don't know enough to know what they don't know, and this book only teaches and motivates readers enough to get them into trouble."
5,Everything You need to know tomake $$ in real estate,"This book is the most comprehensive book on real estate I've ever read. I've been to many courses, and have read other books, but this one offers advice on everything you could imagine when it comes to buying, investing in,maintaining, and selling real estate. It's not a ""get rich quick"" book. And that's a good thing. Russ explains that you need to surround yourself with a wealth team to advise you and guide you (especially if you're new at this) so you make the best decisions. If you're serious about making money in Real Estate, I'd advise buying this book!"
4,Handbook for beginners in real estate investing--excellent,"Real estate investing has different levels of players. Some are content to buy at list prices and hope for appreciation of the value of their holdings, some buy at list price and then rent a property to hope to offset some or most of the mortgage value while waiting for appreciation. Mr. Whitney goes a step further to show how to buy below list price and then to make the maximum amount possible by renting, leasing, or selling. This is a very useful handbook for the beginning investor. He provides many links to other resources, as well as very clear explanation of how and where to find the right kinds of properties to invest in."
4,Duplexer attachment for HP Photosmart 3210xi all in one,"As always, HP products are the best!This duplexer is a must for your HP photosmart 3210xi all in one. Thanks HP and Amazon for networking with the company from which we could purchase this unit."
1,expensive accessory offering very little value,"I bought the PH ph5582 duplex printing accessory for my HP Photosmart 8250 printer, spending more on the accessory than I did on the printer. Big disappointment! I expected the same duplex printing that I get with the laser printer at work: fire and forget, duplex done automatically. No such luck. First discovery: you still have to take the paper output and feed it back in again by hand through the input tray to get duplex. Second: if you try to print a document with an odd number of pages, it gets all screwed up.This device is a very tiny improvement over the manual duplex printing that you can do without this ill-conceived $80 add-on. The 8250 is a wonderful printer, I don't know what HP was thinking when they came up with this accessory."
4,Great T,"I've tried buying several other kinds of ""unbreakable"" tees, this is the first that has actually held up. It doesn't bend all over the place. One thing I wish it had, was a marker for a standard driver."
4,nice tee,"nice tee, i like the fact that its hard to damage so you don't need as many as you normally would....will buy again."
2,The qualility suffers a bit,"Bought it for it has weather band and cd function for my application it was a good fit. The unit came in perfect condition, no complaint with that, but the install of the remote came with a poor connector on the extension cable which without made the remote useless. Neverless the radio works,weather band for me was a need, and the cd is nice but it skips really easy and doesn't use rewriten cd which is about 90% of my cd's that only details in the instuctions in the troubleshooting section, oh well it was still cheap. Jeff"
2,junk,"Radio sounds great, Works great when it works. About 4 months after purcashe while listening to radio it would suddenly stop the sound and the screen would read play cd. There is no cd in the unit so it would then switch back to radio. It would do this 5 or 6 times for 5-30 seconds and then go back to normal for an hour then it would do it again. I contacted pyle whose response was we will getback to you on how to get a replacement. They never got back to me. Even after many emails and calls where I am told that a manager is not avaiable but will return my call. Now it cycles betwwen radio - play cd every 2-3 minutes I cant listen to 1 whole song on the radio. Wish I would have given up the extra 30$ and bought a real brand radio."
2,Pyle Audio unit PLCD16MRWB,"This is the second of the same unit that I have purchased and I'm batting 50%. The first unit was great, the second, not so great. The new unit will not accept a CD into the slot and if you push it in (vs. the automatic feed) it still will not play the CD. Radio works fine. I have been trying to contact Pyle but it's a maze of recordings, punch this number, then punch this number, and eventually you are left with a voice recording saying leave a message, which I have done. Nobody calls back. I've sent emails as well, no response. I am now weaned off of Pyle but I will amend this review if by some stroke of luck somebody from pyle calls me back with a RA number and they send a new unit that works. Stay tuned."
1,"Just like the name says, it's a pile of %&*!","I bought it thinking a Marine stereo takes a pounding but I was wrong. I had it installed in a overhead compartment in my Jeep CJ5 and there is absolutely no way you can listen to a CD. It skips way too much, I took it out and now it's collecting dust. I bought a Pioneer CD player with a USB port on the front and I plug in my jump drive and there is no skipping even while in the dirt. The CD player on the Pioneer works 10 fold better too. I'm staying away from their products."
2,trying their best to make money on you,"- no matter whatever options you select from the site, make sure you double check your first bill. And, of course, it is the pain to make the calls to get things fixed.- i ordered 4 lines for one familyTalk Nation 700 Rollover, and amazingly they put 4 lines as Primary line on one Family plan? what logic is that?- got to make several calls to fix all the charges and options, and couldn't get it right at first attempt.- just be careful, What you select is not what you get."
3,Consern,My son is 4. We had to cut off the straps because he had twised them around his neck and we were worried it could be a choking hazard.
5,The therapy of laughing at oneself,".Provocative Therapy was developed in a psychiatric ward as Frank Farrelly, dissatisfied with his effectiveness as a therapist, began to explore new procedures for promoting significant, resilient change in chronic and recalcitrant patients. He now demonstrates the method in seminars and in this book for ordinary neurotics, like us.Provocative therapy is a wild form of confrontational therapy that cuts to the quick of a problem, throws it up in the air, bathes it in outrageous humor and opens up the possibilities of change. It works because Frank Farrelly has a deep understanding of the human condition and he knows how to make people laugh at themselves.This book has been called ""the funniest book ever written in the clinical field"" by students and professionals alike. Many of them have also described it as ""the clearest book ever written about psychotherapy.""."
3,"Really cute, But not the best chocolate.","I purchased several bags of these to use as prizes for a mad hatter themed baby shower that I hosted, They were really cute and a big hit among the guests but I did taste a piece of the chocolate and it wasn't even worth eating. For the effect though I would purchase these again."
4,Good Eats!,"These favorite chocolate treats are especially good designed as ""flamingo droppings."" Great tasting, fun packaging. Made a nice gift for caring neighbors."
5,Cute and Delicious!,This is a wonderful and fun gift for the flamingo lover. Comes nicely packaged with a neat 'flamingo' label.
2,An indelicate misunderstanding,"I had been expecting White Chocolate Flamingo Droppings, the kind favored by *les nobles qui sait* in Nice and Monaco. I have used those for years as both an alleviate and an ironic potpourri for would-be long-term guests, and I have never been disappointed. Imagine my dismay, then, when I received (by breathless messenger) this item, clearly intended to be *eaten*. Shudder."
5,Great Markers,These Markers are super fine tip. I bought them because the expo markers and other brands at staples that have fine tips weren't fine enough. It is smudge proof and sticks well on a dry erase board. I would recommend these markers if you wanted to fit more detail on a dry erase board. That's what I bought it for
5,SMG is as close to pure Rock 'n Roll as you get,"While I have not purchased this album I am familiar with most of its songs. I agree, SMG (taken from a line of Elvis Presley's song ""Jailhouse Rock"") is a Rock 'n Roll band. Their sound is nothing like New Wave. I remember listening to them when I worked in Germany over 20 years ago (yikes, it has been that long) and remember their cover of the classic Rock 'n Roll song from the 50's, ""School Days"", which I believe was titled in Bayerisch as ""Schui Tog"". This song showed that they were indeed a Rock 'n Roll band. I look forward to my purchase of this album as it is indeed close to what I would have included in a ""Best Of"" album."
4,I use these for my PnP vinel combat grid,These are great to use for quickly drawing out maps on pen and paper combat grid mats. Just be sure that you remember to wipe it off before storing it too long! Or you may end up with a shadow!
2,Avoid Brandsplace!,"This supplier is a group of BURROS who can't read their own ads, or count. I ordered a box of this item (12); I got ONE (1) !!"
1,Don't Bother,"I could find little to recommend about this book. Even the title barely made sense. If this book were food it would be a ""bad carb,"" offering a high glycemic index with almost no nutritional value. The inept writng was peppered with more clichés ""than you could shake a stick at,"" and the plot was silly and simplistic. The characters were flat and so poorly drawn that I found it impossible to make myself care about what happened to them. Dialog was banal. Example: ""...Did you read it?"" ""Yes. It was great."" ""Yup. Good picture, huh?""I struggled to read to the end, but that was not satisfying either. It was a very pat finish with too many disparate ends tied up in the last few paragraphs. I would not choose to read another book by this author."
2,Should be listed under Young Adult Fiction,"While definately an improvement for this author in plot development, I really felt I was reading something like a Nancy Drew mystery. Definately done with this author -- I like my reading to be a little more intelligent."
2,A 6th grader might enjoy it,"This was simply written and not very exciting. The murder could have been committed by any of 10 unusual people. By the middle of the book, I really didn't care who did it. The book failed to get me hooked."
3,Just fine,While you read this book you'll laugh a couple times. This is a story to read while in vacation and it'd be awesome if that trip is to Hawaii. Everything in the book'll keep you reading...except the end. I think that CHC didn't know how to finish the book and just made a fairy tale out of it. That was very disappointing because she could written 50 more pages and get a much better end.
3,A great beach read.,"Carol Higgins Clark writes another engaging story. I like the way she portrays her heroine, Regan Reilly, as a strong, intelligent, and self-reliant woman. As in her former stories, the setting plays such an important roll. Also, like her other stories, I couldn't figure out ""Who Done It"" until the end. We are using it for our Book Club choice this month."
2,A slight improvement,"This book is somewhat better than Carol Higgins Clark's previous effort, Popped. The plot and some of the characterizations are less stilted. I say SOME of the characterizations, because the secondary characters are, as always, completely one-dimensional and so self-consciously quirky that they interfere with the flow of the story. And, as someone else pointed out, the police work--or lack thereof--was dreadful.Finally, I find it completely unfathomable that a Mount Holyoke graduate has such a tenuous grasp of grammar, particularly the use of the past perfect."
5,"Carol Higgin's Clark's ""Burned""",The storyline is good and it keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out who is at the bottom of a murder.
3,OK,Wish she were as good a writer as her mom. I enjoy her mom's books so much. They are easy reads.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4,A good summer read,"I enjoyed this book. The plot was easy going and fun. Writing a mystery book with a lot of details is hard. This book was made to read and enjoy while on vacation, maybe in Hawaii. I also read her next book ,""Hitched"". I like this book too. Just a fun, quick read."
5,Buy this for the Grumiaux trio's performance of D 581,"Schubert lovers may be drawn to this CD because of the Beaux Art trio's fame, but the best performance on the CD is the Grumiaux trio's String trio in B flat. Arthur Grumiaux's artistry on the violin raises this trio to sumblime heights. His phrasing and tone are exquisite and transport the listener to a place out of time.The Beaux Art trio's performance is quite good, but they take second place to the incomparable Grumiaux."
2,ho hum,"an outstandingly mediocre performance of some of my favorite chamber music. happy to have it in my library for the price -- it's a total bargain. but this recording shall always remain, in my mind, a reference point, not a goal for other ensembles to surpass. this cd is definitely worth the price -- you get more than you pay for. however, regardless of the price, this will likely be my last beaux arts trio purchase. imprecise and poor pitch, in my humble opinion...."
1,Is it REALLY Paco??,"I've been using Paco Rabanne for 35 years. I still have four 2-ounce bottles at home. The 33.8 oz bottle I received has a slightly different scent when applied. After about 6 hours, it begins to smell a bit like burned hair, and something else I can't identify. I don't think it's the genuine article. Will not reorder here."
5,Good purchase,"Product was just as described and the ship date was very fast. Excellent seller. This product is a HUGE bottle, which is a great option to have if you don't want to keep purchasing smaller bottles."
2,Not great for metal,"I purchased these for marking up mild steel that I am fabricating, but I went back to using a sharpie. The problem is that the white grease/chalk does not want to work on smooth surfaces, and the tips are not very fine so writing is not easy. That means these would probably be bad for china as well. If you have rough or porous surfaces, they might work great. I think I'll try to send them back..."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality, it doesn't unwind well, the cord breaks - and the grease is very hard. Ended up using a pencil sharpener which is awful with grease pencils"
1,Avoid this book unless you want to read the sequel and like cheesy writing,"Totally unsatisfying ending -- need to read the sequel to find out what happens to any of the characters. I am curious to know, and I appreciate the attempt at Christian fiction, but in the end the dialogue seems too unbelievable for me to read any more."
3,Frustrating,"Mrs. Moser's style is fun, fast, interesting. But the theology seemed forced and unreal. And I was irritated (that's not really a strong enough word) that men were written out of the lives of these women, all the way to the end. I understand life's difficulties and bad men, but they were truly inconsequential in this novel. Bailey was redeemed, I guess, but he was still irrelevant in the long run. This book was very frustrating and unreal in the end."
2,Haftarah Comentary,"Very well outlined and printed, but the commentary perspective is flagrantly feminist and therefore distorts, or at the best ignores, genuine historical context. The work has a feminist agenda that takes away from credible analysis."
1,5 Months and Dead,"Are you kidding me!! I paid extra ($153)and bought direct from Amazon and the (ThinkPad T/R/W/Z/SL Series 9 Cell Li-Ion Battery Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC) lasts five months. Piece of crap!! Looked new, Lenovo packaging, it just died."
4,Good battery,"The battery fit well, works, and had the Lenovo logo on it. I just have a personal gripe that batteries are the first thing to die on your laptop, yet there is no standardization. Each is customized to the shape of your brand and model of laptop so they are not interchangeable and end up costing you a small fortune."
5,Great replacement battery for my Lenovo,I wanted to purchase this product for an extended life battery for my Lenovo. Have been using this for a few weeks and am pleased with the battery life.
3,"No complaints, other than slightly slower shipping!","The product is not as advertised, its definitely not OEM. But upon further review of all the options given under new, I found and selected Origin Micro after checking in their website for information pertaining to whether the Battery was OEM and/their return policies!They sent me the OEM (though it is about $10 higher in price than this one) not a third party battery and came well packed and well tracked! The recommendations were spot-on! It was among the lesser price for an OEM 9v battery that I saw!Only minor compliant is the really slow shipping, but I was in no rush, so its all ok!I am giving this 3stars because if you do dig in you can find an OEM among the merchants listed there, but if I just had to rate this one, I would probably rate this a zero or 1, because it appears as a classic bait and switch!"
3,short battery life,"Under 2 hours of battery brand new. For a 9 cell battery, I expected a longer charge. In the future, I will pay a premium for an OEM battery. Aftermarket is worth the price."
1,Not original Lenovo as advertised,"I ordered this product from Computer Brain because it was advertised as ""Thinkpad battery by Lenovo"", and the product image shows the IBM logo. When I got it I found that it is in fact a ""Thinkpad compatible"" battery made by ""Premium Products"". I have asked the vendor to replace it with an OEM product or give me a refund. I am waiting for a response from them. UPDATE: they agreed to take it back and refund my money. I sent it back 2 days ago, am waiting for the refund."
1,Warning! Not a real IBM/Lenovo battery!,"The photo for this product shows an official IBM/Lenovo battery, but what was shipped was a generic battery that does not show up as genuine. Watch out!"
5,Battery performance is great!,I bought a pair of these batteries for my two sons in college. The standard battery supplied with their computers would hold a charge for about 2 hours. These new batteries will last them for a full 6 hour day on campus! They now have the freedom to fully utilize their laptops - even in areas where no power outlets are available. Well worth the cost for that flexibility.
5,Happy as of now,"The delivery was prompt and the item was as promised. It's been about a month since I bought it and till now, I have no complaints. To give an estimate of the battery life, I use Ubuntu on my Thinkpad T60 and if I use the browser with a slightly dimmed display, I get around 3.5 hours of battery life.However, I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that I get a long service from this battery as the original Lenovo battery which came with my laptop just died one fine day even though I did not use it at all (as I use my computer more as a desktop and hence is plugged to the power all the time). Let's hope that the same fate does not lie ahead for this one."
2,Not like they used to be..,Quality of my battery wasn't as advertised. I might get 3 hours out of it if I turn off the radios and dim the screen to the lowest setting. Under normal conditions I get two hours max. Not sure how long it would last playing a DVD but I get a full movie when streaming... but not much more. The identical battery this replaced lasted nearly three times as long when new.
3,thinkpad battery,Doesnt really have that much life than the 6 cell battery. But it does do good as a back up when ever power goes low.
5,"Ordered from Origin Micro, got new Lenovo product","I ordered from Origin Micro, Inc. I can't speak to the products from other sellers. I got a legit Lenovo 9-cell battery. It came in official Lenovo packaging and appears to work perfectly.After reading many of the negative reviews complaining about non-Lenovo or fake Lenovo batteries, I was concerned about getting an inferior product. After seeing the reviews claiming that Origin Micro shipped genuine Lenovo batteries, I called them up and spoke to a seemingly knowledgeable man who assured me that they only dealt in OEM products. He said they had this particular battery in stock, so I ordered it.It showed up two days later and came in Lenovo packaging. I plugged it in and it works fine. I run Linux, so I wouldn't have gotten the non-Lenovo battery warning if it was fake, but I haven't discovered anything wrong with it. I get the expected battery life. I have had it for about two weeks with no problems."
4,Good battery,"I got this battery 6 months ago and it's been working well so far. If I don't stream videos or use the internet, the battery life lasts for about 3-4 hours. With video streaming it lasts for about 3 hours."
1,old baterry,"It seems to be a old battery/or produced long ago in Turkey. It's 12-cell, but runs out of energy much faster than the indicated standard specification. This is probably the reason why its price is lower than same-type Lenovo battery offered directly by Amazon."
2,Lasted 14 months,"This battery worked fine for me and appears to be a Lenovo OEM. However, the battery life started declining after about 7 or 8 months and it died completely after only 14 months of use."
3,Good,"Used the product once and found it a little difficult to utilize at times. But, overall a good investment if you are a researcher."
5,Perfect markers for any project,"I bought these markers for my husband who is an intern Architect, and he LOVES these markers. He has tried a couple of other brands before I broke down and bought these for his birthday, and he will now only use these. He wanted me to make sure I put in this review that he LOVES the flexibility of the double-ended markers, but his favorite part is the color. When his projects are dry, the colors are exactly what he was hoping for. Prismacolor is a winner!"
1,Very Bad,"These markers arrived in a box that was colored on, torn, and taped back together. The labels on the markers looked chewed on, and many of the caps were on the wrong markers."
3,too overrated markers,"this marker are too overrated, they are very juicy and the ink is too dark in all colors because of that is too dificult to do some blender or mix. the ink is so juicy that pass through most type of papers. you can try with crayolas or faber castell instead."
1,Harry Potter Cheaply Made,"The first time my niece wore the watch, the flip top case fell off. This watch is worth about $9.00. It is very cheaply made and isn't close to being worth $40.00"
5,What a deal,"I can't believe I got these gloves for $15. I have big power in both hands, and these affordable gloves are a little better at protecting my hands than other gloves 2-3 times more expensive. I can hit my heavy bag at 100% without worrying about just one punch not landing perfectly that can damage my hand. I am new to striking, and these gloves really helped unlock my power. I promise this is the last time I say power. They really helped my get creative in throwing combinations with more than three punches with body punches at 100% and kicks. I was using smaller grappling gloves, and 30 minutes on the bag would require 5 days for my hands to recover. Now I can work out everyday. And I can go crazy without smashing my hands."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for some fresh ideas using homework assignments in my private practice counseling setting, however I didn't find this text to be particularly useful. While some of the entries were interesting, I don't think the examples would be easily generalized."
4,Descriptive & entertaining,"This is my son's favorite book. The age range for this book says 4 & up, but my 2 year old just loves it. The illustrations are magnificent. My son & his day care class love to get involved and make the sounds that are in the tall, tall grass. Highly recommend!"
3,interesting perspective,"The GoodBig pictures, splashy colors. The best part is the microscopic perspective. You feel like you are right with the boy in the tall, tall grass zoomed in on each creature that crawls or skitters by.The BadThe rhyming is sometimes awkward and there isn't much of a storyline."
4,One humble opinion,"To me, what makes this book so appealing is the variety of familiar and more unexpected creatures that are to be found ""in the tall, tall grass,"" and what makes it remarkable is the perspective from daylight to dark. The text bites and Eric Carle style illustrations do not seem particularly original or unique to me beyond that (though others might disagree: its was an American Library Association Notable Book and a Boston Globe Horn Book Honor Book in 1992), but it its still an enjoyable, good quality read for budding naturalists and youngsters who are curious about the world around them."
5,Happy Mommy,"My son brought this book home to read and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, he had to return it to the school library. I had promised to buy it for him. However, I couldn't find it anywhere. So as always Amazon saved the day! Christmas was around the corner so I figured I'd try to get it in time. Luckily This company kept its promise and it was delivered just in time! And wow the packaging should they really cared to have this book delivered in the best condition possible! Thank you!"
4,"What a colorful story, and pictures.","Fantastic pictures! Great for introduction to rhyming words. Shows children all the different animals and interesting activity of them as they live in the tall, tall grass. It also shows the journey from animals seen during the day to those seen at night. A very simple plot, not to much of a story but the pictures really add to it. A great book for younger children!"
1,Didn't work for us.,"Bought these for our 4 year old who has bedwetting problems. We tried nearly the whole bottle with no improvement. Maybe all bodies work different and her's didn't like to work with these pills. Hopefully the problem clears itself up, or we can get something that actually works from the DR."
2,Didn't work for us,My 8- almost 9-year-old son tried these as a last ditch effort to get dry. He's back in diapers now. These pills never worked.
1,Complete scam,"Complete waste of money (as is all homepathy). Placebos may potentially be effective for quasi-behavioral issues such as bedwetting; especially in children who are too young to understand that homeopathy is just fantasy, but if you're looking for a placebo, you could buy some kind of tiny candy pieces for much cheaper than $6. Interestingly, having belladonna in this concoction goes against the root (fallacious) premise of ""like cures like"" since anticholinergics (drugs that inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system) actually cause you to make less urine. At 3X there probably are a few molecules of the different ingredients on the sugar pills, but much, much too little to have any effect. It's a scam, save your money, try limiting liquids after 5-6PM, middle-of-the-night waking to pee, rewards for dry nights, and if that doesn't work, try some kind of alarm system."
1,Placebos,This was a disappointment. I was hoping it would at least HELP get my son out of pull-ups but these tablets have had absolutely no effect at all.
1,Didnt work at all,It was a waste of money. They did not work at all for my 8 year old boy. He even stated he thought he wet more when he was taking them. I was giving him 3 with each meal and right before bed.
5,Finally no more wet sheets!,"We have been using these for about 3 days now and have not had a single accident. My 4 yo used to wet the bed every night, even with me and my hubby taking him to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night. I came to Amazon to buy those Underjam diapers because I was tired of washing sheets, but I came across these instead. I figured that they were a lot cheaper than diapers and I have had great experiences with the Hylands teething tablets, so what the heck. I have only been giving him one dose(3 tablets)at dinner time---mostly because I forget at breakfast and lunch---and he is doing great. We don't even have to wake up and dreag him to the bathroom anymore. And he is feeling pretty good about his dry bed too. He wakes up every morning with a big grin on his face and says, 'Look Mama, no peepee!'"
5,"tony ""mudbone"" merkle is my dad",i relate to this book b/c i no what went on in this book b/c of my dad and the stories i herd from my dads friends in the warlocks and my mom. and ive been to these places and still live around these places still. also rick martinson is my sisters god father. rick martinson is currently in prison. most of the things in this book are true but not all. and barry spelled my dads name rong. its spelled merkel. i highley recomend this book to anyone and everyone especially bikers. this is a good book on true biker crimes and what goes on.
1,Interesting story>>>>,"I've read this book twice. There are several issues with it:1. First and foremost, non of the Warlock's club members are interviewed. All of the information was obtained by police or local news outlets.2. The connection between the Marsh Murders and the Club is tenous at best.3. We never really get too much into who Bobby Nauss is. The other people mentioned in the book, ""Rick Martinon"", the alledged head of the club are even more ambiguous.4. At the end of the book, the conclusion is rushed. The last eight pages, Bobby is arrested. There are a few sentences that suggest Mr. Nauss was part of a larger conspiracy.In the end, a disappointing read. I am not a biker, nor do I particulary care for the lifestyle. That said, it's pretty easy to demonize someone who rides a motorcycle and wears a patch on their jacket. I almost felt that because these were bikers, the murders had to have been committed by members of the club."
5,Sad but true,"It's a shame that this book is out of print. It would have been a page turner, even if I had approached the story without a personal connection. The victim, Liz Lande, was a friend of mine. I appreciate how the author, Barry Bowe, managed to capture the sweet and caring side of Liz."
1,Not a trure depiction of the Warlocks I know,I have known many Warlocks over many years and have never known them to be any thing but Honorable and rigtheous Men. They are the last of the free souls who just want to left to them selfs and have a family like community. This book was written by cut and paste from news paper. I hope people will read this as an intersting fiction and not believe this to be the Men of the Warlocks I have known and trust for so many years. Mr. Bowe it seems just wrote a stero-typical account of what the public see as bikers and to make money. I assure you that bikers are good people who just want to ridw and be left alone
1,I would like to meet this guy who wrote it,"[...] ,if you like fictional stories go ahead and waste your money ,I to lived this book and saw how these lies effected me and other familys ,Thank God I didn t waste my money on this trash you call a book ,my copy was passed down by some idiot who bought it ,and now I want to hold a book burning party,just to show Barry Bowie how I exactly feel about the trash fiction he wrote ,what gave this guy the right to trash peoples lives and were you even thinking about us the kids who now we refer ourselfs to either products of or biker bratz ,you think you know but you have no clue ,could it be this guy was a wanna be ,.Born Free and proud to be .The Kidd 66"
5,hot book,I was in the airport over the Holidays and was looking at all the new fitness books that were out. Gunnar Peterson's book caught my eye because of all the Hollywood stars and starlets he works out with. I have to admit I knew very little about him other than his infomercial's that air late at night when I should be sleeping.I bought his book and started my workouts on Dec. 15th. I am proud to say that in 2 weeks I dropped 5 pounds and have the mental energy to move forward with his plan.I love this book. It's fresh.
4,Book for Real People,"Gunnar Peterson's own story is impressive, he has struggled with injury and weight problems. Then he became Beverly Hill's premier trainer for celebrities...and he cuts through the 'stuff."" This book tells you the basic exercises everyone needs to do, defines a battle plan for attack and has humor. (Which I suspect is what makes him so popular with his clients.) If your looking for fitness to last a lifetime this is the book, also an excellent book for parents of teen athletes, because Peterson keeps it real."
5,Only Fitness Book You Will Ever Need!,"I have been working out for the better part of my 38 years and I have never come across a fitness book more complete and helpful than this one by Gunnar Peterson. Like most things in life total life long fitness can be attainable for all once you master and understand the ""building blocks"" you need to succeed. Buy this book and take your fitness to new heights."
5,"Easy to use, fun to read, and not just useful but inspiring,","It is not often that you come across a fitness book by a guy with these credentials. Usually the books are by people who've lost weight themselves and think they can tell everyone how to do it. But if this guy can help Hollywood types squeeze into their tiny pants and dresses, I think he can help the everyday joe too. And that would be me.What drew me to the book was the charts that tell you how to lift weights. As a not heavily overweight man, but needing a lot of sculpting, this really appealed to me. This is what makes that final difference between plump and fit. I also found Peterson to be very motivating. His information is excellent -- there's tons of it but what got me was how he presented it. He's a real inspiring writer, and reading it got me pumped. I'm ready to go, armed with new arsenal and a real motivation."
3,G-Force & The Workout EXACT SAME BOOK,If you own G-Force this is the exact same book with a black cover. Seriously. Save your $11.00 to buy one of his DVD's. They are amazing.
3,Re-hash,This is a good workout book with sound principles and easy to follow format. My only problem is that I was unaware that it was the same book I already purchased under the title G-Force. I am not sure if this was made clear in the right up about the book. I thought it was a follow-up to G Force. I was wrong. He is a good trainer but be sure to only by one of his two books.
5,Solid CD from beginning to end,"I have to say, this group reminds me of Lollipop Lust Kill and Gruntruck (except Gruntruck has finally came out with a follow-up CD, and its proof that one hit wonders might should accept their fate). Really great, one-off CDs that rock in their entirity. Sure, no one's gonna mistake this for British Steel or The Mob Rules, but its a great, solid CD that rocks from beginning to end. I've been listening to these guys and this CD for some years now. Every now and then it grows old, I put it to the side, and some months later re-discover it all over again. The final track ""Holy Dio"" is particularly relevant given the untimely passing of one of metal's greatest vocalists."
2,"Good text, poor illustrations","It's a little like kissing your sister...the text is good, the pictures stink! This little known rifle deserves the good write-up it gets here from Myszkowski, but the printing is dismal. The pictures look like early photocopies or even mimiographs!People who buy this book probably are looking for some insight so they can make informed choices about adding a gun to their collection, or to evaluate a gun that they already have. That requires GOOD illustrations! You'll read the caption, you'll look at the blur of a picture and you'll shake your head!Wait for another book!"
5,Great FPS not an RPG,I love this game and I must say I am confused about the reviews. If you like FPS type games you will love this one. Guns and Magic. Elves and Trolls. I am addictive most fun I have had on the 360. Graphics are not Gear of Wars quality but the gameplay is a blast.If you don't know if you will like it rent it and try it out for a week!
4,Alot of fun,"I really like this game as it is a blast to play. I have not ran into the cheating or the immaturity on this game like i have in others. The FPS action is fun and the magic and tech add a very nice aspect to the gameplay. Instead of just run-n-gun like halo or shotgunfest like gow you have a more balanced game. People tend to use resurrect on this game to bring teammates back and the teamwork just seams to work better. I would give this game a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that it can take a while to connect to a game and then some games(had 2 yesterday) get stuck in the character select menu and other things that cause you to have to restart which means waiting a few minutes for a new match. Although no offline, which would have been great, this game is exactly as advertised for me."
3,Big Dissapointment,"I bought Shadow run about two weeks ago and was very pleased when I got achievements just for playing the training levels. After I finished all six of them, I went to try my skill online. It was pretty fun (esp. gliding and all that stuff) except that I thought that the training didnt get me ready enough for the actual game. And now for the games biggest flaw of all. NO CAMPAIGN!!!!!! What were the designers of microsoft thinking. Since there are is no campaign and only silly bot missions (which are incredibly easy) the game just teachs you what buttons to press and nothing more. Games like Gears of War, G.R.A.W, and Rainbow Six Vegas all give you a very good campaign that is challenging and will get you ready for online play. Shadowruns lack of this makes the game less than enjoyable (unless you like dying all time)."
2,Not the best purchase.,"I received the disc with several scratches which was to be expected, granted it was used, but the disc did not work. It was cleaned several times in order to make it work but still randomly does not work."
1,No Solo!!!,I would have really liked to know in advance that there was no solo campaign in the game. I would have never bought it. Why bother with a little back-story during the training sessions if there's no CAMPAIGN!!!!
2,A nice idea but,I have to say my only knock against the game is a single story line instead of the player vs player element. Especially for $60 is a bit much.
4,Still one of the best shooters on consoles.,"No it doesn't have a campaign, let's just get that out of the way. The multiplayer is however one of the best experiences I've ever had on a game even years after this game came out it's held up well. The classes are balanced as well as the weapons and abilities and you're really encouraged to experiment with the combinations of races and abilities to see what works well. My only gripe is that the online connection is almost never solid, it is always kinda laggy."
4,Not the Ordinary FPS,"This FPS is online and system link only and has no campaign. This game actually requires strategy and teamwork to win unlike other first person shooters. There are 6-7 weapons and 10+ Magic/Tech abilities to choose from. Once you die you must either wait for next round or hopefully your teammate has ""Resurrect"" so you basically come to life again in the same round. You get money simply by killing your opponents or by doing damage to them such as hitting them with grenades and bullets. Each round you gain more and more money thus have more options to buy various items kind of like counter-strike. Overall, this game is worth buying unless your a hardcore halo fan because H3 comes out pretty soon. Well my gamertag is ""The HecklerX"" send friend request if you want to play anything."
4,Now that the price has dropped it is well worth it,Shadowrun plays like a great Half-Life. The best multiplayer on the 360 right now and fun as hell. The problem with the game was the price of $59 since it has no single player. Now that the price has dropped the game is well worth picking up.
5,XBOX 360 Shadowrun,It arrived in a acceptable amount of time. There was no damage to either the box or the disc. My husband has enjoyed the game.
2,who on earth greenlighted this!?,"I bought this game on day one based on the fact that it was a next-gen shadowrun. I read about it and became very excited about the gameplay and the new ideas. But then I actually played it. With all the time, effort and money put into this game, why is there absolutly no single player story mode. This is based on a world with some of the richest history in pen-and-paper rpgs out there. Why could they not even muster up the time to put in even an average single player mode. (the lame bot matches and training missions don't count) I mean for crying out loud, even halo and gears of war had memorable storys and characters. And those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. Its not that the gameplay is bad. The multi-player is actually very well thought out. But for a game that costs us 60 dollars, there is absolutly no excuse for no story mode. I'm not even going to start on the lack of maps. (which is pretty pathetic for a basically online only game."
2,Eh not so great,"I don't know what it was about this game but I really didn't care for it at all. The teleport ability was cool, though. I think it was the only part of the game I liked."
2,wow its ok,Honestly i would be mad if I bought this game brand new for the price when it came out no story and practice mode then online witch to suck and another thing the gripe me is you have earn mony to get weaoin or powers online witch is even gayer but beside that its just ok thats it worth 11$ thats all to me
4,Seems good,My step son has mostly used this. I've watched him play a bit and it seems like it could be a good time you just have to be into this type of game.
4,Game is great but,This game is fun but it has been out for a long time and not that many people play it anymore. I would say there are at least 100 people online everyday... so i would just say get at your own risk
3,Multiplayer And Beyond,"When you first play Shadow Run you'll want to do the tutorial then jump right into multiplayer. It gives you kind of a satisfaction when you revive someone on your team. The weapon selection is not the best but I like the way that when you get really good at a weapon you can keep using it to jump to the top of the rankings.Gameplay: 3, Story: 2, Replay Value: 5, All Round: 3"
3,A whole lot of training...for nothing,"I probably should have taken note of the fact that Shadowrun provides Achievements simply for completing each chapter of its training. After six chapters of training, you're...ready to go play CTF, basically.RPG enthusiasts: walk right past this game. There is NO solo campaign. It's quite disappointing that the game developers didn't see fit to do much more with all the intriguing concepts - teleporting, resurrection, etc - than turn it into Halo online, with cool magic. You can only imagine what sort of wickedly engaging campaign could have been written to challenge the player - and, maybe, hope that Microsoft Studios will develop a (downloadable?) campaign for this platform in the future. Until then, this is yet another game written solely for the online fragfest environment."
3,Amazing game! BUT NO CAMPAIGN!?!?!?!,"As I said, Amazing game! BUT NO CAMPAIGN!?!?!?! I love the gameplay, the weapons and the strategy of the game are great. It is really fun and I was having a good time until I realized that there is no campaign. That really made me mad, and this game will get really old playing multiplayer because I really live for FPS campaigns. A disappointment from a great game. Unfortunate indeed. That makes me a lot more impatient for Blacksite to come out. Amazing demo and I can't wait for the game in septmember."
3,"Fun, but overpriced and needs work","You should know already that this game is multiplayer only.However, the game seems to be released more as a Beta than a final version. A lot of the bugs have been fixed with Live updates, but simple things like Preferences, game customization, choosing map orders, etc are pretty poor design. That is inexcusable when a game is strictly multiplayer only. It is worth $30, that is it. Don't pay more."
1,This game is not worth it,I played the game and it turned out to be a complete waste of money and time
1,Terrible Stinker,This game is just a canker in any videogamer's collection. Please don't buy it and don't let your friends buy it. What I'm saying is why can't I give it 0 stars?
1,Bad copy,at first i never got to play the game every time i put it in it said please put this game in a Xbox360 console after turning my system on a off and reinserting the game it finally works but i have to do the same for ever game
1,A simple story mode could have helped,"I saw this game online and got caught up by the potential story, prior to this I had no idea an RPG ever existed for Shadow Run. So I'm clueless as to the history of this game. That being said, I noticed there was no single player story mode right away, I played for about 20 minutes and have not played it since. Honestly, because I have no sense of history for any of the characters the game is boring. If you're debating on picking this game up, pass...."
3,Still impressive.,"Don't be fooled by the litany of composers listed, this CD is about Jascha Heifetz. While I am certain he was THE violinist of the day, we - as a global community - simply didn't have the technology to capture the man's music adequately; not by radio, not by recording (what else was there then?). In all of our attempts to ""remaster"" the old masterpieces, while we no doubt have improved on the original recordings, we have not - and sadly, perhaps never will - hear the music the way we could have heard it live. Having said that, this CD is definitely one of the best attempts to capture the magic of the man that is now, rightfully so, a legend."
5,Definitive Debussy,"There are already several excellent, well-detailed reviews here, so I will simply chime in to say that I honestly do not see how there could be any better rendering of Debussy's distinctive, gorgeous sound than what Haitink and Amsterdam have put together on this set. Every note, every phrase, every texture is absolute perfection. As far as I am concerned, this is the most essential Debussy set ever recorded."
1,Very disappointing. A waste of money.,I have been listening to my Preven and Ansermet interpretations of these works. The recording is superb. The rendition is rubbish. Not even March Essociase is suitable for listening. I wasted my money on this one. It is highly NOT recommended. I am sticking to my scratchy records over this cd. Yech.
1,Knorr changed - now it's PASTA AND RICE,"We used to love this rice mix, was very tasty.However, Knorr seems to have changed it to be pasta and rice, not just rice.We might have been OK with that if the flavor remained - however, it is EXTREMELY BLAND now.We did the subscribe and save for the 12 pack of these, and YUCK!!! Just cancelled that."
3,Burnt Out of the beats!!,"I mean I like Project Pat and all...But, Im just sooo tired of the same betas..Im mean, Im a person who loves ""the beat"" the beat. Its all about that to me!! But, since Project and his Posse have dropped a number of albulms, all I can find myslef saying is doesnt this song sound just like the last one... I mean its hard for me to tell!! Pleasew, on your next album, use different beat schemes, maybe a different mixer...because Im very much so ready for a change!!!! Im tired but maybe youre not!! If thats the case, go for it!! You wont be disappointed because you already know whet youre getting...Pretty much the same thing you got from previous albulms!! Awesome right?? Id beg to differ!! Suit Yourself!! Id go ""Lil Boosie"", before this one(for the beats)..."
3,What's new,"Project Pat is good for purely entertainment purposes. The beats are usually pretty good, but if you actually listen to his lyrics and how he makes up words to complete lines, i can't do nothing but laugh. I'm not saying this cd is bad, because it is pretty entertaining, and its making me listen to it. What do you really expect though? Quality lyrics that actually have a point? or is he going to tell me to tell my old man hes not going back to jail again?"
3,Damn right!!!,"We love it, we love it alot!!! Tracks 2, 4, 10 and a few others. This guy can flow and the hooks are pretty good. I love Three 6 Mafia but Pat is better. Three 6 Mafia should be Juicy J, Lord Infamous and Pat. Heck, after listening to this CD and the old ones, I wished to be a rapper. Out!"
4,BOUT DAMN TIME,"YEAH ITS GOOD, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IS WAS BETTER THAN MISTA DON'T PLAY, BUT GOOD NONETHELESS. OF COURSE U GOT SOME ABOUT THEM SNOWTING AND STUFF, THOSE I HAD TO SKIP, CAN'T RELATE, THEN KILLING AND RIDING AND PIMPIN.I ENJOYED THE MORE LAID BACK TRACKS, THE BEATS AND LYRICS ARE DEFINITELY ON POINT THOUGH. BEEN WATING FOR THIS ALBUM FOR THE LONGEST, ONE OF THEIR BEST SINCE THE LAST 3 SIX ALBUM WHICH THEY DEFINITELY DO MENTION THE OSCAR AT THE END. MY FAVS ARE ""IN THE PROJECTS"", ""U LIKE"", ""IM A PLAYER"", I LUV ""PURPLE"" AND HOW BEANIE SWITCHED UP HIS STYLE, REALLY DON'T LIKE NORTHERN RAPPERS, SO THAT'S DAT, ""WHAT MONEY DO"" & MY FAV ""BEEN GETTING MONEY"""
4,Online Reputation Management from Career Enlightenment [...],"Online Reputation Management: Your Google ResumeThis excellent DVD will show you the necessary steps to manage your online persona, something which is very necessary these days for the average person, but even more so when one is seeking new employment. Do you really want the first thing that a prospective employer sees when conducting an online search on your name, (and this WILL happen at some point in the selection process), to be unflattering, or possibly even erroneous data which should not be attributed to you?Without resorting to unnecessary jargon or trying to blind you with science, Joshua Waldman will show you how you can begin to regain CONTROL over how Google, and by extension the rest of the world, sees YOU!"
5,Great audio,Lots of very useful and informative information that I never heard on other webinars. The is the top of the series!
5,fact of life,"While we can decide what to put on our resume, we cannot easily determine what our individual on-line world-wide-web presence would look like. Joshua offers some interesting and effective strategies for mitigating the risk and highlighting the positive."
2,Nice book but with errors,"All the other books I've seen in this series have had Spanish-language error, but this one has the most, which I believe is due to the difficulty in trying to translate one-word prepositions in English into Spanish, which frequently require entire phrases. For example, for 'under' she has 'bajo'. In fact in Spanish one would have to say 'debajo' or 'abajo' (depending on whether you meant 'underneath' or 'movement under' something). Same thing goes for 'up' and 'down' (her translations are wrong.Like the other books in this series, she seems for be using a Spanish-English dictionary and has little fluency in Spanish herself."
4,Great series,"We have all of the books in this series. I have an 18 month old who has been studying these books for 6 months now. At this point, he is least interested in this book. His favorites NOW are My Colors and My Shapes. My Opposites is still a great book; I suspect that he will appreciate closer to 24 months along with My Numbers..."
4,A sweet farewell,"My daughter (not quite 2) loved following the whimsical brood as they said farewell to their cottage for the summer. I enjoyed the sweet story based on the childhood memories of the author and her sister who illustrated the book. ""Goodbye Lake"" is a perfect gift for any cottage kid or family, especially as fall draws near and that goodbye day approaches. Enjoy!"
2,Flimsy mats. No good for anything.,These mats are barely thicker than card stock. They are unusable for matting purposes.
1,totally useless,"if you are interested in spiders, this is NOT the book for you. If you are interested in anything else, this is NOT the book for you. Spend the big bucks and get a real book on spiders. This is a waste of time. there are only 4 spiders in it!!!! very annoyed."
4,Good but ...,"It's a good book, however, I think that it can be a bit disappointing for napoleon's fans because the author seems to have a clear bias to the british side of the conflict. That being said, the book is interesting and easy to read. The author try to remark the courage of the soldier of every nation. Some of the battles refered in the book are Marengo, Berezina, Zaragoza, Waterloo (just a small part of it). No Austerlitz, Wagram or Borodino battles in the pack."
5,OP/TECH USA 1301072 System Connectors (Swivel Hooks) - Extra Connectors for OP/TECH USA Straps with Quick Disconnects,"I have ordered previous items in this product line. All of them have been interchangeable from item to item. Yes, I would order more items from this product line without any haste! Thanks, Randy H."
1,Great product if you like mercury poisoning,"I took this brand of fish oil for 2 weeks and ended up with a metallic taste in my mouth, dizziness and a strange toxic feeling. I googled my symptoms and came up with mercury poisoning. It went away after not taking this product for 3 days. Apparently you have to buy ultra refined fish oil in order to avoid mercury buildup in your body. This is clearly NOT ultra refined fish oil. I hope this helps someone..."
5,Satisfactory and almost extraordinary,"I purchased this CD with high expectations, but was only left simply satisfied. The drama, character, color, and musicianship is all there, but I found the new theme to be very single-phrased and lacking forward drive or longing. Is has much longing, but it seems that all Williams was left to do with it was to repeat it in different colors, schemes, and moods, which he does brilliantly. It's not like many of his previous dominant themes from the earlier Star Wars films, where the themes were allowed to develop. This particular melody seemed too static.So, I give this five stars not so much for the emotionally charged, romantic, all be it static, love theme, but Williams' usual genius for creation and color."
2,Mostly a disappointment,"In many ways, Williams became famous for Star Wars.But ""Attack of the Clones"" (AOTC) is perhaps the weakest of all Star Wars scores.In simple terms, this score reminded me of Jurrasic Park to the point where I believed I WAS listening to Jurrasic.The only definitive theme in the score was the love theme. But I must painfully state that it sounded too inspired and un-original, not to mention that it was repeated to bloody death throughout the CD.The constant violence and randomness of the music during action sequences is very disappointing. I felt I was listening to either the orchestra warming up or an amateur composer. The bashing and poor attempts at innovation do nothing except bore the listener with endless noise.I do not hate Williams. I love 90% of his other work. But this is clearly not his best. Nowhere near it."
5,A beautiful soundtrack,"Although I have loved John Williams work, this soundtrack for Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones, has got to be the best.There is action in such tracks as Jango's escape and the Bounty Hunters Pursuit and mixes of lovely melodies and hot action.There is romance in tracks such as Across the Stars and The Meadow Picnic. The effects that John Williams has put into these songs is intensifying. For all you instrumental individuals out there...... John Williams put great cresendos in the music and loud effects and has a different variety of instruments playing."
4,Great Soundtrack,"This is really a great soundtrack. The only thing missing is the rest of the movie. With the other movies (Episodes I, IV, V, and VI), you could get the ""full"" soundtrack. I am hoping that they will release one for not only Episode II, but for the upcoming release of Episode III as well.As for the copyright protection, not only does this CD play on your computer, you can make copies (for your MP3 player or whatever), it also comes with a screen-saver program (although it is not as good as the one available from starwars.com)."
3,"Maybe unfair, but...","OK, so reviewing a soundtrack without seeing the movie is unfair, so with your salt-shakers in hand... the album is so-so. It may be the abridgement, which I also think hurt the first release of the Phantom Menace soundtrack. But, with the exception of the finale track, there does not seem to be much interplay between the motifs on this album. The love theme is beautiful, but there is not much other new material that stands out on this album.It may be that the score is perfectly adapted to the film, which I expect to be somewhat brooding and romantic, from the sound of it. But then again, so was ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" which I consider to be the richest of the Star Wars scores. The only soundtrack release which I would say was worse than the ATC soundtrack was the original release of Return of the Jedi."
3,2 and a half stars,"I actually want to ratew this 2 1\2 stars beacuse its a little better than the Episode 1 soundtrack, but its still not very good.This track has a little more action than 1. It still completely pales in comparison, however, to episode 3."
5,Another Williams Masterpiece,"All of the tracks on this soundtrack take some theme from The Phantom Menace, but Williams manages to add that dark element with the addition of the familiar Imperial March and the new dark theme for the seperatists. Across the Stars was a wonderful theme that captured the love story of Anakin and Padme with the non flowing melody that almost sounds like Han and Leia's theme from The Empire Strikes Back. The chase music from Coruscant as well as the battle music from Geonosis was superb. The addition of the Force theme with the twin suns of Tatooine was a nice touch from A New Hope. This soundtrack really set up the dark tones that will surely previal in Episode 3. This soundtrack not only is a great soundtrack for fans to add to their collections, but it is a great soundtrack to listen to for the music lover. Well done John."
4,Waiting for more...,"Whenever a Star Wars film hits the screen, we, as a musical audience, are taunted with a mere 10-16 tracks that seem to be plucked from the movie. Often times these are concert pieces of the best themes in the film or actual pieces from the film mixed & mashed together. Either way, they are wonderful, but sadly lacking. With the original trilogy, we had to wait almost 20 years for the full scores. Fortunately, with ""The Phantom Menace"" we only waited a year or so until The Ultimate Edition.Where I enjoyed the scant selections from ""Attack of the Clones"", I'm waiting for the full score from the film. The 13 tracks are nice & have a few FUN surprises in them, but they're really just a tease. The only real gripe I have (aside from the CD being too short) is the same I had with Phantom... not enough use of the Star Wars theme. In the Clones soundtrack, it's present in the Main & End titles & that's about it.So, if you like Star Wars, buy the score. It's short, but sweet."
3,Great Music pity the CD is defective!,"I tried the CD at home in my DVD player and my CD system and it worked perfect.I have now tried it on two different PCs and different software playersand all do the same thing,Track 13 plays fine for about half way to 2/3s then starts breaking up real bad.And track 8 isn't even listed.I read on another message borad that it is copy protected.No warning on the CD anywhere. Sence I play most of my albums on a PCthis is no good. I am going to return the CD.Has anyone come accross this ?Deasun"
1,Lucas should quit the cut and pasting,"It was tragic watching 'Attack of the Clones' in the theaters, listening to passage after passage of re-used 'Phantom Menace' tracks. Shame on Lucas and crew, and shame on the studio execs who released this LIMITED collection of tracks on CD. The music is beautiful but over too soon. What other music was there in the film? What music got scrapped?Lucas created the original Star Wars 20+ years ago, and without Williams score his film would have been another 'Logans Run.' Williams is THE star of the Star Wars films, and his music was [not treated well] in 'Attack of the Clones'. Lucas and crew should know better.Think about it: what music could we have heard as Anakin and Padme arrive on Geonosis, or in the arena battle, or in the clone battle? Certainly new music, and not 'cut and paste' music from Phantom Menace. The treatment of Williams music in 'Clones' was SHAMEFUL and sad. Lucas and company should be ashamed."
3,Not brilliant.,"All of the pieces in the first movies' soundtracks are great even without the accompanying action, esp ANH and ESB. ROTJ started a trend (but not much) of the pieces being more dependent on the movie's events, and The Phantom Menace continued this track. TPM still had some great themes, like Anakin's theme, and Duel of the Fates, but other parts sounded more like a ""soundtrack."" AOTC has one GREAT theme, the love theme, but not much else to offer. The Chase Through Coruscant is mostly just orchestral hits that while effective IN the movie is kind of weak on its own. Most of the other pieces are similar. The Finale and Credits is good, but it relies on the only good piece, the love theme, a bit too much. Buy the album if you're a big SW fan, but don't go out of your way."
2,"Rather unimpressive, but typical of Star Wars today.","I've only listened to the CD a couple times, but not only do I find this the weakest of all the Star Wars soundtracks, but probably one of Williams' blandest. I can hardly compare this to the stellar achievement of the Empire soundtrack, or the musical beauty of the Star Wars soundtrack. It even fell below the Episode 1 soundtrack, and this kind of relegates it for me. It was like he did it in a rush and had to borrow a lot. If it grows on me I will modify my review, but I found nothing on this CD to cheer about.Now two years later, I give it an extra star, to three. I actually have ended up listened to it more than the Episode 1 soundtrack, often quietly as background music."
4,"Lacks Variety, Still Great Songs","As a fan of Star Wars since the first one arrived at theaters in 1977, I have also loved the music. Can you think of any other movies that have such great scores? Well, maybe, but perhaps you are counting the other scores for the Star Wars epic.The CD opens with the traditional/original theme. A lot of this CD had lighter songs from scenes with Anakin and Amidala. And then I was surprised to hear some of the notes weaved into other songs. But it was done wonderfully. One thing this soundtrack was lacking was an emotionally charged song such as Duel of the Fates from Episode I. However, listening to this CD will make you want to see the movie over and over. (Probably what marketing planned!)"
4,What I expected,"The correct Williams soundtrack. Everything here is like a clock, and he's so graphic that sometimes he may be telling us the movie. It's 50% the story, you know."
5,very good. very moving.,"This soundtrack has arrived and it is better than The Phantom Menace score, although a bit mellower. The presence of Star Wars is fuller and themes of old raise it to an almost instant classic level. Very majestic, especially the love theme. If you care about Star Wars, buy it."
5,First in Class,"This is an absolutely great ""Star Wars"" soundtrack for what promises to be a great ""Star Wars"" film. ""Across the Stars"" is a true display of John William's genius and is one of his best pieces yet. ""Star Wars"" films are all heavily entwined with their music, they go hand in hand. If the film measures up to this wonderful soundtrack, I can tell you right now, it's a winner!"
3,"Good, but John sells out","MOST of this CD is music in the classic John Williams mold, but what is extremely disappointing is his use of electric, Eddie Van Halen-style guitar in track 3 (Zam the Assassin). When I first heard it, I thought there was some problem. I was thinking ""no, that couldn't be an electric guitar in that song"", but I listened to it some more and sure enough it is! I hold John Williams in such high regard I couldn't believe he stooped to that level and sold out. I mean, I like Eddie Van Halen as much as the next guy, but that style of guitar has no place in a Star Wars movie soundtrack.Other than that, it's great John Williams-Star Wars music, but I was just so appalled that Williams would actually put that in his music. Good CD, though. Not as good as Empire Strikes Back in my opinion, but worth purchasing."
2,eh not as good as I expected,"It's very typical John Williams music. This CD is mostly background-soundeffect music. Not a whole lot of actual music. The best music is the love theme -- track 2, but this melody is repeated often through the other tracks. There are some short repeats of music from the previous starwars movies. The CD is ok but not great. Maybe I'll like it better after I see the movie"
2,This Is Not Star Wars,"Every once in a while a score comes along that transcends the media for which it was created, either stage, screen, or television. John Williams accomplished this with his original Star Wars score and to a lesser extent with Episode I and ""Duel of the Fates."" Unfortunately the music for Attack of the Clones falls far short of the standard we've come to expect from Hollywood's premier composer.Listen to ""Across the Stars"" and DON'T think of Hook, I dare you. Uninspired and largely thematically irrelevant, the entire score rambles like a sentence without punctuation, and leaves the listener wanting much more.Perhaps the movie will make up for it by being able to carry the music for a change, but I'm already sorely disappointed."
5,Soundtrack from the Star Wars movie Attack of the Clones.,"This is a truly remarkable soundtrack. John William's ""Love Across the Stars"" is absolutely beautiful and makes one actually feel the love that Anakin felt for Padme. I highly recommend this soundtrack for all Star Wars fans."
1,extremism-r-us,"This review is meant to reinforce R.W. Rasband's: unless you're a member of the extreme right-wing of the Roman Catholic Church, this book's not for you (and not what it appears to be)."
3,A bit disappointing after chapter one,"The best part of the book is the profound insight and critique of the Enlightenment philosophy. Much of this is found in the first chapter. I have three concerns over the book with the last being my most significant: a nave view of Roman Catholicism as a stabilizing institution, Jones traffics in too much speculation by saying the ""monster"" really represents repressed guilt, and the amount of graphic sexual and/or violent material. I found this absolutely unnecessary for making the points the author wanted to make.Notwithstanding my main three concerns, the book was a valuable read."
5,Under the Sun of Satan,"Slowly and by degrees the world is inching towards an understanding that the ""Enlightenment"" was at best cleverly orchestrated agit-prop, at worst a self-indulgent, wanton grab for power.This is a wonderful book. Jones confidently, wittily and effortlessly dissects the manners and morals of the likes of Shelly and Godwin. My only wish is that Jones in the future would broaden his canvas to convey the horror that has been the legacy of the Enlightenment not just in the realm of sex but in the entire culture.That said, this is cultural criticism at its best. A treat! It reminded me of Dostoyevsky's ""The Devils."" It demands a place on your shelf along side the likes of Eric Voegelin, Marion Montgomery, Jean Brun and Thomas Molnar."
1,Never use Amazon again.,"I was totally disgusted with the product that was sent to me. It was dirty,, scratched and four song s couldn't be played whatsoever. I won't be purchasing any more products via Amazon."
4,funky fun Jazz at Christmas,"Good CD, fun to listen to, with some terrific musicians and vocalists. Not a generic bunch of music."
1,Does NOT light up,"I ordered this item in October 2010, and the toy I received does NOT light up, it just plays music. It is also somewhat different from the picture shown. There is no ring at the top, just a strap with a velcro closure to hang it by. And the pull cord is not at the top of the star but attached at the bottom middle of the star (just under the baby's chin). Also, the butterfly is hanging from the pull cord at the bottom middle and there is no snail (so there are only 3 items hanging from it instead of 4).I wonder if there are two different versions of this toy, one that lights up and one that doesn't?.... But even the manufacturer's tag attached right to it says it's supposed to light up, so I doubt it's a case of them mistakenly shipping the wrong item. Very disappointed, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and requested a replacement. If the replacement does not light up either I will return the item."
3,Its okay,I really liked it but it isn't anything my daugther goes after. If I hand it to her she will play with it a bit then go to something else. I got it for her when she was 5.5 mths and she is 8.5 mths now.
5,A treat for the ears,"I received this as a gift and threw it in the cd player not knowing anything about the band. I am into progressive rock (porcupine tree, spock's beard, etc.) and jazz. This album was very impressive. I ended up listening to it about 5 times the first week. Each time a different layer of music seemed to come out. I was really impressed by the rhythm section and how they made the songs flow and move. The album just gets into your skull and stays with you. I have bought the rest of the albums just because I was so impressed with this one. I will be looking forward to what they turn out next."
4,i'd buy it for the bonus cd alone,"so this album is pretty great alone. If you like their previous albums, this one shouldn't disappoint. key tracks for me are #8 When we escape, #4 White Mystery and #3 Knights... which brings me to the explanation for the title of this review. I love, love, love the remix for Knights on the bonus disk. At first listen to the album, honestly, I did not like the song... I'm so far over the cd skip technique sometimes used in songs. I don't see how it adds anything creative to it, and frankly... it annoys me. but the song remixed... is amazing."
5,Step in the right direction,"Planet of Ice is the perfect progression for Minus The Bear. The album is truly amazing in that it has a certain feeling throughout the whole album so no songs don't belong there. This album is truly experimental. It is obvious with all of the strange sounds and effects used in each song. The album gives a much more dark and complex vibe but that is what they were going for. This is really just a mature album. Yeah, I know everyone was expecting ridiculous song titles but with each album the band has progressed. Menos El Oso's song titles weren't that crazy, so their creativity is still there in full force within the musical context. I really love the songs White Mystery and Double Vision Quest. The reggae-esque part toward the end of Double Vision Quest is simply awesome. Anyway, I think anyone could really like this album no matter what else you listen to."
2,Keeping in mind I am a huge MTB fan. Revised,"Im not sure what is going on, maybe I am just not listening to it correctly but this is the first ever release by mtb that I didnt instantly love. I have tried listening to it on several occasions and have yet to be brought in at all. Maybe in 2 years from now I will find it under my desk, throw it in and be like ""Ohhhh, ok, now I get it."" For now I would say its a pass.Ok a few months later and after learning to skip the first two songs I get it. This is a great album and the last song is spectacular, I still maintain that it is not as good as the other releases but they set the bar pretty dam high."
3,What a shocker!,"Well, I have been a fan of Minus the Bear for about 4 years. This album was a shock. Bands are allowed to sound different from album to album and progress, but this is a regress. Minus the Bear took a simple and melodic indie rock sound and added some nice touches too come up with an original sound on their first few albums. Menos El Oso was a more direct rock approach, but still had qualities and a sound you do not hear in other bands.Enter Planet of Ice. After the first 3 tracks it is all down hill. They just went with the classic rock sound. Boring. I am 32 and think classic rock is overrated, but you don't need to bring that sound back. It makes you less original. The album is well produced and mixed, but the songs themselves do not sound like the band has progressed or even like their past efforts. Sorry, but Minus the Bear is turning into Minus the Exciting."
5,Great New Album,This album is amazing. never gets boring. if you liked Minus The Bear's other albums you will LOVE this one. even if you only liked some songs of Minus The Bear you will learn to like this album.
5,Touching,"My son and I read this together and cried through the last couple of chapters. It's so sad, but beautiful, moving and compelling!"
3,Disappointed,"This priest's story was a good one, I am sure. But why insert a love triangle when there wasn't one in reality? Italy is the same as Hollywood it seems. And this true story took place during World War II. Well, the ones who made the movie were probably not Catholic or were born after Vatican II when the novus ordo Mass started. When this priest was actually a priest, the Mass was in LATIN and totally different from the way the director/producer portrayed it. The vestments were correct, but the words were not. This is not a truly Catholic movie. Somebody truly orthodox should remake this movie please! It was terrible. Also, the story was sappy to begin with. Not realistic. Shame on Ignatius Press for putting forth such a bad movie. Too long, too."
5,Don Carlo Gnocchi DVD,"This is the story about a very good and unselfish man, a peron dedicated to a good cause and I like stories like this. He has also founded an excellent establishment or series of establishments as I have viewed these for the disabled in Italian, in Italy. If only we had such gracious clinics here in the USA!!"
4,Pretty good,Pretty good film. Liked the acting and the depth with which it portrayed the characters. Inspiring in this secular world and the message is important.
5,Better than others,"We've broadly sampled kids' devotional books--many that are sold and recommended by Focus on the Family and FamilyLife, but many have been disappointing--just too elementary or redundant for our kids. THIS BOOK IS EXCEPTIONAL. It has moving stories that powerfully illustrate biblical principles. There's just some talent that British authors have for telling a really moving story... Our children (ages 8-12) even have a few favorite chapters/stories that they've asked us to re-read. A couple of the stories may move you to tears. Great kids' devotional if you're tired of the usual fare."
4,Excellent but pales in comparison with Mazur,"I enjoyed these poems but the ""authenticity"" was lacking in my opinion. Liszt is one of those composers beloved by the public but scorned bt the ""experts"" - another case of being so smart you don't know anything. The Symphonic Poems are one of those ultra-Romantic creations that seemed to spring fully-grown from the pen. Each one is related to a story or mood, although with the level of knowledge from today's education few would recognize let alone understand the connection.How many people could even tell you who Prometheus or Goethe or Schiller was much less how the piece related to them? Les Prelude was good (not great) as was Orpheus. Mazeppa, the most dramatic of the set, came off sultry rather than scintillating.Then again, I am comparing everything to the incredible recording by Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Those two sets are the apex of Liszt recordings (MHS only)."
4,"Good, but...","While the recordings on this CD are nothing to complain about, the quality on several of the songs is slightly staticky, and sounds mildly muffled (not as much ambience and echoing as needed to make these songs have full effect, especially on Mazeppa). Unless you really want the Symphonic Poem No. 1, you'd do better to stick with other recordings. The first of the poems is very hard to find and this is the reason I bought this CD. Unfortunately, it falls under the staticky song category."
5,I'm so glad I can finally wear earrings!,"My ears were red for a couple of hours after putting these in because they weren't use to wearing earrings. I was actually surprised I could get these earrings in because it had been so long since I wore any due to a reaction to every pair I ever tried. These are nice, subtle, sparkly ear decorations and they don't make my ears ooze, swell or glow red. Love them. Love that I can wear earrings."
1,Non-Existent Customer Service,"Who knows if these Mini Crystal Silver Titanium Earrings won't lose their finish? I bought some silver hoop earrings from Simply Whispers, and the hoops turned black very quickly--I'd only worn them a few times. When I emailed Simply Whispers' so-called ""customer service"" about the problem, I got no response, even though I attached pictures that showed the defect. After several weeks, I mailed the earrings back to them, with an explanatory letter. I thought if they saw the defect for themselves, they would respond. Again, ZERO response. Once they have your money, you can expect NO response from Simply Whispers if the product proves defective."
1,MISLEADING TITLE ......DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS ITEM IS SOLD PER PIECE.... SELLER SHOULD CHANGE ITEM TITLE/ DESCRIPTION TO READ "" item sold per piece"""
3,"Effective, but not convenient","Simply put - the ""marker"" part works fine. The ""peel-off"" part does not. The perforations are not thorough, so the paper doesn't tear where it's supposed to. This leaves you with a five-minute job of trying to get the thing peeled back, as well as a handful of paper shreds to dispose of."
4,Good and helpful product for glove break-in,"Good product -- works well in forming the glove around the ball during initial break in. Much easier than fussing with ropes or rubber bands or straps, plus the stretchiness applies pressure evenly."
5,Best glove wrap around...,"After spending close to $300 dollars for Rawling HOH for my sons, I was determined to find a way to preserve is AND break them in. This product was great. We also bought the Rawlings break in kit, but I think this one is a little more user friendly. We still use the oil and the big plastic ball from the Rawlings kit, but the Markwort is much better as a glove wrap. The Rawlings glove band/wrap was a little difficult for my little guys to get on their gloves, but this one is user friendly for adults AND kids. They keep their gloves wrapped when they're not using them, and we love the little pocket that lets you keep a ball in the glove while it's wrapped. I highly recommend this product..."
5,GREAT glove protector,"This is a much better product than the similar Rawlings product I bought in-store (and I LOVE Rawlings gloves and am a HUGE Rawlings glove user). So my advice is, buy the Rawlings glove, but buy the Markwort Glove Locker. The velco attachment is what makes this so good. It can be stretched to accommodate the size of your glove. Great product."
3,not the same as in the picture,"The book I received had red on half the cover. If I was trying to match it and give the set away as a gift, I would have been more upset. It does not match the others. I guess it's the same content because the author is the same, but it definitely stands out as NOT a part of the original set."
1,Calls himself a christian yet blatantly lies,I don't understand how Duane Schmidt can write such a horrendous piece or literary work and act like its true. He argues that evolution is not real even though it's a known fact now. Just because something is still a theory doesn't mean it is not a fact. He obviously doesn't understand how science works. I don't understand how this man calls himself a Christian with the amount of lies he conjures up in this book.
1,Anti-evolution Distortion,"The author tries to debunk Darwin's theory of evolution. He states that he has a sweeping case against Darwin, and will show the flaws of his arguments and the lack of supporting evidence. Amazingly he not only fails, but in all 13 error-ridden chapters makes a fool of himself by showing his ignorance about science and evolution. The other amazing thing is that Phillip Johnson, the ID guru, endorsed it. It clearly raises the issue of whether Johnson is really interested in the truth. This is the worst book I've ever read. People like this should not be allow to write such time wasting drivel."
4,These are great!,Bought these because I made my own shuffleboard game. They work great! They roll about 95% straight and that margin of error adds to the game in a great way.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I was disappointed that after my first use they started to rust, and then rolling them was impossible. After using them I would recommend trying to clean them with alcohol and storing them in a jar of oil or something. Stainless steel balls would be worth the extra money."
2,Very small,Love the quality of the shuffleboard pucks; however they were very small - about 3/4 inch in diameter. I wish the vendor would have put the dimensions or a picture showing perspective of these pucks then I wouldn't have bought them.
1,"software has a trojan in it, and not fuctional","after installing it I had to right click the programs properties and set it up for windows 95 compatibility settings because it wouldn't respond in windows xp then it worked however everytime I looked up any article or word with the encyclopedia it would produce no results.. (font wasn't showing up) no information on the subject so tell me.. what good is the encyclopedia if all it shows are pictures.. I might add some topics do have information and tells u about it like ""canals"" for instance but in the dictionary it produces nothing so far. some only show pictures but no info.. I am still playing around with it but so far not impressed at all.-------just now discovered the software had a TROJAN embedded in it!!!! very upset about this! And worst of all there is no way to uninstall the program. do NOT I repeat do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! product cost me very little so rather than hassling with a return I have to take a loss on it!"
2,I'll never buy again,These would be great if they didn't run like pantyhose so easily. I'll go for a quality brand next time.
2,The jury is still out,"I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday in January, it stopped working in less than a month. Amazon sent out a replacement straight away which we received yesterday. It is a beautiful looking watch for the price, but not very sturdy. If this one stays working, then my next review will be closer to five stars I hope."
3,Invicta silvertone pocket watch,"Invicta always has great products, just wish I knew it was going to be such a small watch."
5,Artist Information,I do know that Norene Foin was not 50 when she did this CD. How do I know? I am 42 and a I am a classmate of her's. She was and still is a very good singer. You will not be disappointed.
2,Reality Check,"Some people go skydiving, travel to exotic lands, or make some other life long dream of adventure a ""reality"". I guess for her 50th birthday Norene Foin decided to make a CD. No doubt, HER lifelong dream. More power to her. She has a lovely voice, but in this age of American Idol, the bar has been raised, and I for one expect a lot for my musical dollar."
5,Extrabreit is wunderbar!,"Annamarie stands out as one of my all-time favorite tunes of the German post-punk era. I have it on vinyl, but I'll probably get it on CD know that I know it exists!If you like Extrabreit, then you'll also like Die X Agenten."
3,"Lovely music, but that's not all you hear . . .","These are beautiful and uplifting pieces. The sound is wonderful, but on the third track of the first CD (Symphony 82, Menuet), one can hear someone audibly keeping time (""and five"" or something like that). Aside from this, a good buy."
2,Here's a Tip-- Don't Buy this Book,"Although highly touted by Amazon.com and written in a warm, chatty style, this book doesn't answer the most important question-- How much SHOULD I tip? Many pages are devoted to how to slip the money into the service-provider's hand, but unfortunately few words are devoted to how much is actually appropriate. Wanting to reward and to not be cheap, many people wonder how much to give. If this book would have even given a little table in the back (e.g. Bellhops- $2 per bag ($5 in New York)) then this book would have indeed provided a service."
3,tipping for success what you know already!!!,"although interesting, this book told me nothing saavy travelers and smart business people do not already know, be nice... be firm... addresss people by name and respect their title and of course...a little grease($$) always goes a long way"
4,Kit doesn't mean Bits,"I am very pleased with the quality of the drill. I was disappointed when I opened the box, because I had assumed that a kit would also include the bits. A short walk to home depot, and $18 fixed my problem, and it's still a great bargain even when you add the price for the bits."
1,If there was a rating less than 1 star I'd give it that !,Didnt work when it arrived.......BROKEN........DEAD....USELESS...I guess the quality control was out to lunch the day this item went down the belt.
5,reliable drill,"I am a weekend handyman and I use to own a rechargeable Porter Cable drill (magnaquench). The battery finally failed to take a charge and I was stuck with an obsolete $200 drill set. I decided to get a corded backup drill while I consider the cordless options (li-on batteries , etc...) This reconditioned drill had a lot of power and was more effective than my old Porter Cable drill (not being fair... corded vs. cordless). This drill does arrive with a little smudge and there is a distinct burnt electrical smell. I was a little concerned with this until I used it to drill out a rusted toilet seat bolt. It was powerful and withstood a long drilling session (2 rusted bolts). By the way... if you are use to the cordless models... it is more noisy and it is quick to grab the drill bits. Be careful with your fingers."
3,great drill for the price,"this is a good, basic 3/8"" electric drill, I use it a lot around the house when I just don't feel like lugging around my big 1/2"" Makita. The only real complaint about it that I have is the keyless chuck, I don't trust them, but it hasn't given me any problems yet. Easy enough to replace with a Jacobs keyed chuck when it dies. If you are just looking for a cheap drill for basic stuff around the house you could do a lot worse than this one - the price is low but it's actually a decent quality tool that should last a good while."
2,Be careful of the reconditioned drill,"I bought this drill last April, and used it few times, and then it stopped working last week. I was a bit surprise it broke so soon. Took it to the DeWalt service center for repair. After it was examined, I was asked where I bought. I told them it was from Amazon. And then I was told they have found inside parts that were broken and cheap, and not genuine DeWalt parts. They suspected someone just simply rebuilt the drill with cheap parts. Anyway, they fixed the drill for me. So be warned."
1,Waste of money and time,"I bought this software at a local store to burn some disks for a friend's birthday gift. In the end the cds never worked, wasted dvds and time, the box is now in a heap of useless computer junk from years past. Don't let the price fool you or better yet let it be a warning. Piece of crap."
1,too complicated,"Too complicated -Can't use. I just want to copy some cds that I have previously made. Can't do it. I once had a previous edition of Rozxio that would copy ""anything"" in almost one step. Wish I had it back."
1,Doesn't function!,"This product is not the real thing. It doesn't function at all. In all categories, I receive a message stating ""your free trial period is completed."" I paid for this item and it is totally useless to me! I didn't ask for a free trial period period! I tried the Roxio website for FAQ--no help! I wrote to the company and also--no help! I truly expected to receive a fully functioning product when I purchased it from Amazon. I uninstalled and reinstalled the product. Nothing but frustration through the process. It doesn't work!"
1,Money Wasted,"I wish I hadn't purchased this product. Once installed I was never able to get any of the features to run because of one error after another and finally my computer froze or hungup, and I had to run my computer in ""safe mode"" to get to the program and delete it, and then run a rebuild to get my computer back to where it was before the installation, and since this, my computer boots much slower than it did before I installed this program. I've since purchased Nero and it works much better for me, it is a bit complicated. I've also purchased a program from Avantrix, which I appreciate as a senior citizen because the language is not lofty of complicated it is the simplest program I've ever used, for instance if you point to a disc format that it doesn't support, it simply fades out. Most of the ""thinking"" is automatic."
2,wont burn a dvd,I havent used this progam a lot but from my experience so far it is not impressive in the least bit... I tried to create a dvd from home video and for some reason it will not burn it to dvd...The programs have a lot of whistles and bells but if you cant burn your project to dvd or cd it really doesnt do any good unless you just want to store it on your computer. Considering this software is for cd and dvd burning that is what one person would expect it to do.. No bang for your buck here it is a good thing that it didnt cost much!!!
1,Don't buy this product.,"This product is not even named in the drop down menu on the Roxio website so you can't register it. If you can't register it, you can't contact customer service or get updates. It's a catch-22. You can't fix the problem about being unable to register it, because you are unable to register it. Because you can't register it, you can't get any online help about it. Since Roxio's website does not recognize that this program exists, you can't even get information in frequently asked questions. If Roxio does not recognize that this program exists, then why should you buy it? Save yourself the grief."
1,Not what Roxio used to be,"Corel has done to Roxio CD burning programs exactly what it did to Jasc Paint Shop Pro, which is to say ruined the whole shebang.Just as I went back to Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7 after having tried Corel's horrible Paint Shop Pro X, I'm going back to Roxio Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, which does work with Windows XP and reliably turns out a quality CD.This new waste of time and money is NOT backward compatible -- you can't even read open CDs created in REAL Roxio programs. The system requirements for authoring DVDs are much higher than those listed for merely installing the program. (I'll go back to Nero Essentials for DVDs.) I would not have purchased the program at all had I known that in advance. Although Corel claims it works under Windows XP, it is slow to install, balky in use, and not particularly capable when it does work.Roxio easy CD & DVD burning is a huge disappointment, and in my opinion, not worth the money."
2,Basic help needed,"Is it quite beyond the capacities of modern programmers to include written INSTRUCTIONS with their products? I am tired of trying to use products which offer me a series of on-screen icons, and assume that I know their purposes, and how to use them. Worse, some of them depend on previous steps having been taken --links between sound sources and the recording process, for example--without any indication that these steps are necessary, let alone guidance on how to take them. THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS ALIVE AND WELL--FOR GOD'S SAKE USE IT!!!"
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money on this crap. First it is not user friendly in any way, shape, or form. Second it will burn files and folders for backup but there is no option for creating a system image (ghosting). I will switch to real player professional, at least they know how to create intuitive software. Too many programmers today create what they want and don't have the customer in mind when creating layouts, Roxio is obviously one of them. Unfortunately, opened software cannot be returned, so I guess I will just toss it in my fire pit and learn from my mistake. If you feel the need to waste your money, feel free to purchase this junk."
1,ROXIO PROFESSIONAL 5 AND 10,"I FIND THAT NEITHER OF THE TWO DISCS WHICH I PURCHASED DOES THE JOB AS WELL AS MY OLD ROXIO BASIC, WHICH WAS LOST IN A COMPUTER CLEANUP SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. HAVING MISPLACED THE DISC, I ORDERED VERSION 10 WHICH DOES NOT WORK WITH MY COOL EDIT PRO, SO ORDERED THE ROXIO VERSION 5 AND GOT THE #5 PRO (NOT BASIC) WHICH LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND DOES NOT WORK AS EASY AS THE OLD BASIC VERSIION. AFTER MANY HOURS OF TRYING TO DRAG MUSIC INTO THE BURNER FROM MY COOL EDIT PRO, AND TRYING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, I HAVE GIVEN UP, BUT HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANOTHER BURNER YET. BUT I HAVE MUCH MUSIC WAITING TO BURN FOR MY WEBSITE MUSIC LINE (YOSEMITERADIO.COM) IAM ONLY INTERESTED IN MUSIC, NOT VIDEOS. THE MUSIC WAITING IS FROM OLDER VINYL WHICH I CLEAN UP AND USE ON THE WEB SHOW. THIS IS NOT A FAULT OF AMAZON. I AM JUST LOOKING FOR THE ROXIO BASIC 5."
2,Not satisfied,"I happen to have a computer that is running windows 2000 pro as an OS and this product is suppose to work with that system but it does not! I'm still working on the problem but no resolve as of yet. If anyone has any suggestions let me know, Roger"
2,"Not great, Pathetic support","I purchased this program for a mere [...] dollars, but it came with a twenty dollar store rebate (which I have not received yet) All told it should only cost me ten dollars. That is a good thing since that is all it's worth.The good news for me:1. It is simple to use and provides an easy way to burn and copy CD's2. It does have a simple sound editor3. It does provide an easy to use way to convert old LP's to digital filesThe bad news:The label portion of the program is almost totally useless! I have not found a way to import song titles. You can't change the font color. When you try to print out a CD jacket, it prints it way to big to fit in a CD case. Combine this with an awkward interface and it's junk.NOW FOR THE REALLY BAD NEWS: ROXIO SUPPORT IS DREADFUL! NOT SURE I'D WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON THE EXPENSIVE PROGRAM BASED ON MY EXPERIENCES."
1,CD DVD burner,"This program looks good at the outset. It does, however, not load until one has cleared out any other CD DVD burner program. So far it has been worthless, for my purposes."
3,Roxio Easy CD & DVD Burning,"The program is ok thought the ""old"" Easy CD Creator was easier in use, especially in making jewelcasecovers, but i'm not a wizzkid so i might be wrong about this. Anyway, i don't like the program very much and rather work with Easy CD Creator 6, though i lost my code, so ......."
2,Did not solve problem.,"No fault of the product, my computer did not have software for DVD. This product is for formatting computers that does."
1,"Did not work, does not work","I had to install the software atleast three times, contacted the tech support, and nothing helped, the software did not work with window XP, had to uninstalle and and keep with it with other junks that I have."
1,negative evolution,"I used to be able to ""convert"" a song from a commercial CD to a WAV file in the computer with the older version. Newer versions only allow you ""rip"" to MP3. This is going backwards.Also I am not allowed to burn a DVD with WAV files. Not much use to me.Miguel Melgar"
1,DOESN'T LIKE VISTA!!!!,"Although Amazon has this item listed as Vista compatible, please be aware that it is not a happy couple! If you have Vista/7, or plan upgrading soon (Support for XP ends spring of 2014) Then I would suggest spending just a little more and buying at least the 2011 version which works like butter."
1,Roxio: Not all it's cracked up to be,"I find this Roxio burning program to be very time consuming and expensive to use [wasteful]. It seems every other time I use it, it complains about ""something wrong with this disc"" half way through the burn or failing to perform simple disc erases. I quit counting how many CD-R and DVD-R discs I've thrown away because of Roxio's nonsense.I finally quit using it. Now I simply fire up my old, FREE, ""CD BurnerXP"" program and it pops out perfect discs every time.It's just live and learn. The Roxio hype turned out to be a joke.MR"
1,Sometimes it works.....Sometimes it doesn't,"When I first installed this software, it worked just fine for coping music CD's and copying data to DVDs.Then I noticed after having it for a few weeks, that my computer wouldn't recognize my CD/DVD burner. I uninstalled this software and the computer still wouldn't recgonize the drive. I eventually had to restore my HDD to a week before and then my DVD drive came back to life.I reinstalled Roxio Easy CD & DVD Burning once more and the same thing happened.I wouldn't recommend this particular software for anyone."
1,Roxio CD & DVD Burning Software,"I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times. No response. I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio. Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software.I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive."
1,Won't work on E-Machines and no tech support,I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works.
4,Good software at a great price.,"I've been using this budget program for over a year to backup client data to DVD when restoring corrupted drives, etc., as it will span multiple DVDs for you automatically, and install it's own agent on that burn so you don't have to install the product on the target PC. It's very good, and disc-disc copying works flawlessly. Users with problems should check out the Discussion Forums on the Roxio website, they are very helpful. Try to at least know what versions of firmware, OS, and software you're using, and be sure you're running SP2 on XP. Good product, at a very good price."
1,Buyer Alert!!!... don't buy this predator software!!!,"This trash worth less than a penny!!. It comes with no uninstall program. After two weeks a message of ""Trial version expired"" appears on the screen?????? . It cost me about $30.00!. This software write a lot of unauthorized registry entries. It also installed the (unwanted) Net framework! and made the PC slow."
1,Forget it!,"I bought this Roxio software and installed it on my XP system and up came a Corrupted Error report. When I went to get the details this is what came up next: ""Unfortunately, the error report you submitted is corrupted and cannot be analyzed. Corrupted error reports are rare. They can be caused by hardware or software problems, and they usually indicate a serious problem with your computer.""Before I installed this software I created a Restore Point. I unstalled this program and returned to the Restore Point and the message came up ""System fully recovered."" Whew! Stay away from this loser Roxio product. Oh yes, I tried getting in touch with Roxio without success, but that is another story."
1,Really Bad,"Gives message ""Trial version has expired"" shortly after installation. The only proposed solution Roxio gives is to go on a safari through your computer's registry to fix the problem. Don't waste your money on this trash."
5,Great Purchase!,"This was a great ""investment"". I've enjoyed it since it's been installed on my computer.It works perfectly!"
1,Most incompetent and frustrating piece of software ever created,"First of all, this software performs like someones term project. Why havent these guys been sued yet?Pros:Nice retail packagingCons:Not testedDoesn't burn all your filesNO supportOverall a waste of money"
1,"""It doesn't work"" is the kindest thing I can say about this.....","Roxio Easy CD & DVD is anything but easy. That's because it causes my PC to freeze and turns blank disks into trash. Even after I use the Task Manager to close frozen windows, the CD drive is locked shut until I reboot.This PC is less than six months old, and it doesn't have any hard drive or registry issues - at least it didn't before I loaded this software.I'm really kicking myself for not taking a look at these reviews before I purchased this. The Windows Media Center software that came with my PC does it all better anyway.Live and learn.NOT recommended,"
1,"If I could, I would give it a Zero!!","This software has crashed my system so many times, I actually bought a new computer thinking it was my system, and of course their tech support strongly suggested it was a system issue. And that supports costs me $25 dollars, per issue. Some issuse I think were related, such as my system crashing and their software failing writes, were charged seperately. Add the new computer and you have $1,075 wasted.And even when it did work, I would have 4 out of 10 writes fail on me. They kept pointing to the recorder.Well, after months of this BS, I did a fresh install from the recovery disk on my new computer and installed another software program. Nero 6.6, and since then I have not had a single system crash, 60 out of 60 succesful writes, and a program that is full feature and WORKS as they advertise.No more crap for me, and no more wasted calls to Support. Or should I say Lack-Of-Support!!"
1,support really sucks,"i suppose this will create a dvd easy enough but i got it to burn video_ts files and it just does not do so, even tho it claims it will. the directions have you choosing a menu option that doesnt exist and when i contacted suppport i got back a list of online sourses that i was instructed to plow through looking for a solution, my actual question was simply where was the menu option i was supposed to have because it sure isnt where it is stated to be"
1,Avoid at all costs,"caused my CD drive to stop working completely. When I tried to update it I got the black screen of death ""windows could not start normally"". Thank god I had a roxio removal tool (cant even uninstall it without a special tool)AVOID"
1,random read-only,"While it will allow you to save and edit what you saved for two or three times, it abruptly switches to read-only without asking you if you want it that way or prefer the ability to add to or edit what you saved on cd-rw, or add on to cd-r."
1,Roxio / Mad Dog package - destroyed my pc,"I bought that combo package and the software crashed my pc's.Got the free upgrade to Version 9 from Roxio since Version 8 was so awful.Version 9 worked some...at least I could copy a cd/dvd once in awhile if I were lucky, before it hung or blue screened (on xp).Even after that, it interfered with my wireless network card and slowed my entire pc down.I didn't know about the slowing down of the whole pc til today. I bought my wife a new computer because the one I installed Roxio crap-ware on was nearly unusable.Today for the heck of it, I removed all the roxio from that computer and it's once again a fast, usable pc as soon as the roxio stuff was removed. Full virus scan reported no viruses either. Just Roxio - which destoys everything."
2,It should be called Not Easy CD Burning,"The title of this product is a joke. It should be called ""Not Easy CD burning"". Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is. It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this software bundle for one reason: to make copies of DVDs that I had already recorded. It doesn't even do this basic function, it is pretty worthless. After buying it I upgraded to the full Roxio suite and haven't had a problem since. Instead of spending this $25 on this software bundle spend the $65 and get the full setup."
4,Works fine.,"I purchased this after I had no luck with 123 Copy DVD (do not purchase that at all, BUYER BEWARE!). I had Roxio in the past and it is a great and fun software for making cd's. I never used this software to make DVD's until now. It will not copy DVD's with encryption on it, but that isn't a problem once you download Anydvd, which is an ecryption remover. It works great now and I recommend it very much."
1,Problematic with XP Pro,"I got this bundled when I bought a DVD burner. Running a Norton diagnostic after installation revealed a missing file. I had no problems burning a DVD data disc. When I tried burning a CD I couldn't figure out how to use XP's built in burner, Roxio took over. But the CD burned, would not play back. I ended up using Roxio for DVD burning and when I accumulated enough CDs that needed to be burned I uninstalled Roxio to burn them with XP, then I reinstall Roxio when I need to burn DVDs again."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"My first Roxio product was EZ CD creator 6.0. It's been downhill from there. Every version has been more buggy than the last. I have many custom CD covers that I made so I have to upgrade or else lose my collections. This newest version is NOT supported by Roxio and will stop working any time you do a registry clean, (i.e. ""one button checkup""). You must then uninstall the program and re-install it. Roxio has a LONG HISTORY of not caring for their customers. I expect NO FIX will be in the future for this product. YOU ARE WARNED!!!"
1,"ROXIO IS BIG IN THEIR NAME , BUT IS SHAMEFUL IN SUPPORT","HELLO FELLOW DVD FRIENDS, all of us dvd lovers are left in the cold w/ roxio. do not purchase a roxio product. the statement by P. PARKERthe computer grandma says it all. roxio is a big and well known name. but they HAVE NO SUPPORT TEAM. i hate to say it, but if you just got a roxio product and it's not refundable, my opinion is to take the product outside and slaughter it w/ an axe like lizzy borden , then burn it or throw it out or send it back as anonoymous, but leave it in the condtition the way you killed it. NO SUPPORT , NO EMAILS ANSWERED AND IWOULD TAKE A BET THAT THERE IS NO HUMAN BEINGS IN THEIR BUILDINGS. WHATA WASTE AND ASHAME. BUY IT ? YOU ASKING FOR TROUBLE. DON B., ARIZONA."
1,NEGATIVE,I was not satisfied with it because the disc was scratched that is why I returned it asking for another one.After 3 months I have never got new disc and have never got money back.Seller not responds.Seller stole my money.
1,Does NOTHING,this product does nothing. i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied. easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn. everything is copy protected...and i hear that over and over again. there is a reason why this product is so cheap...BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL! u CANT burn dvds. you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player. thats it. dont waste you money on this. its worthless...
2,biography:bill cosby,"after watching this biography of bill cosby,my family and i,who like bill cosby not only as an actor but as a comedian were very disappointed in the video.we expected a biography telling us about mr.cosby's whole life story.the reason why we were disappointed was the fact at least to us was that it spent to much time talking about the original cosby show.grant you it explained other aspects of his life and career but in our opinion it spent to much time on the cosby show that aired on t.v.in the 80's.anyone who has watched the cosby show already know how wonderful and funny the show was.they don't need to be constantly reminded of it while watching the biography.sincerly the miller family."
1,"Very expensive, and not worth it","I had to purchase this as it is required for a class, but even our teacher admits that the book is not that great. It's a very boring read, indeed."
4,It's Great!,"This book explains a great deal about medical billing. It is written in an easy-to-read style, and organizes the information in logical steps."
2,information overload,"This book does show you how to fill in the insurance form for the main insurance plans step-by-step. The negative aspect of this book is the information overload such as the historical background of the insurance industry thoughout the book; it was not necessary, and I'm sure drove up the price of the book."
1,Understanding Health Insurance: A Guide to Professional Billing,"I did not received the book, I order, still waiting to get the book."
3,inked,the book i received was in acceptable condition but all the practice pages were completed in ink and i was not notified of this condition of the book. other than that i am satisfied with my purchase.
3,Very misleading,"I purchased this book with the accompanying workbook. Although it may contain good information, the answers are not provided to the exercises--in either the book or workbook. Apparently, a separate instructor's manual needs to be purchased. When spending [the money] for both books, I didn't even think that answers would not be provided, much less that I'd have to spend [more money] to get them. I'd recommend the book, workbook, and instructor's manual, unless you're taking a class that allows you to check to make sure you understand the concepts.I'm not sure why I don't have voting buttons--I read every review here before I submitted mine."
1,find something better to learn from,"I took a night course which used this textbook. The instructor who is a certified coder and is an instructor at other institutions found MANY misleading instructions. You can be told to do something one way in the book but in real life at a billing job, you would have to do it another way. Also, we found many contradicting statements. They say one thing but do something totally different in their examples. It's really not worth the money."
2,you will need more than just this book to benefit,"The book is made to sound as if it would be all you need to become a Medical Billing/Health Insurance specialist. Not a chance. You will need the most current coding manuals to even attempt to complete this course. And even then without the answers you have no way to check your progress. There must be better books, Keep Searching"
1,Proof that things are worth what you pay for them,"What a disappointment. I really wasn't interested in reading a book about teen angst and the evils of gambling. That's what I got, though. Don't let this turn you off to Silverberg, though — his later books are much better."
1,This is a PIRATED book,"Please respect the author's wishes and don't have anything to do with this version of the book, which has been officially condemned by the author as being pirated. The one star in this review is for the piracy, not the book itself. Robert Silverberg is one of my favorite authors, and he is definitely not a one-star writer."
1,Author Condemns This Pirated Edition,"This is a pirated edition of a very early book of mine that I allowed to go into public domain, long ago, because I was replacing it with a revised edition. Back then, it did not seem worthwhile to renew the copyright, because I did not intend to allow a new edition of the original text to appear. Even though as a science-fiction writer I'm supposed to predict the future, I had no idea in 1969 that the Internet would arise and many years later so-called ""publishers"" would find this book and distribute it against my wishes for their own profit. It may be ""classic' science fiction now but it's also the work of a beginning writer who, in later years, did not choose to offer it to readers, Someone else chose to do so anyway. You buy it at your own risk and with the knowledge that the author did not wish this version of the text, which he wrote when he was in college, to appear again.Robert Silverberg"
2,An excellent book for young teens,"Silverberg is a master of science fiction. This early work is of course no where near as good as his mature work, but it is clean and readable. A good story for a young teen."
3,1 star for pirating 5 for the story,"the 3 stars i gave this is an average. the story itself is a good classic pulp sci-fi book. well worth 5 stars. however, i have to give this a single star for the fact that it's a pirated edition of the story condemmed by the author. i normally wouldn't deal with a pirate copy but times are tough and i couldn't afford a real copy. i recommend this book. just try to get the authorized version."
1,Hell hath no fury like a biographer scorned,"This is simply the strangest biography that I have ever had the misfortune to read. Rather than describe Burgess's life in any useful or even thoughtful way, it is instead a sustained exercise in hatefulness. All biographers either like or dislike their subjects, but good ones know them well enough to feel that they cannot be classified as wholly likeable or or detestable. This author has an axe to grind, though we are not told what it is about. He allows himself to use his book as a spiteful tirade against Burgess, a selfish exhibition of childishness and I am surprised that a publisher agreed to see it into print. It reads as if written by a spurned lover, rather than an intelligent observer of another's life. If you have any respect for Burgess's work, don't waste your time on this misbegotten temper tantrum.Christopher Moss"
1,Nasty garbage,"I can only echo the other reviewers. How on earth can one be driven to write almost five hundred pages on a subject you despise. AB was no angel, but nothing he did was ever deserving of this vile calumny."
1,Bitchy Bio,"It is completely baffling to me why anyone should spend time writing a biography about someone who's work and personality they detest.I stuck at it till the end. My problem now is should I bin it or burn it, lest some poor innocent reader wastes his time as I've just done."
4,Women in the news,This is a mcuh needed area of focus. Information of the contribution of women is difficult to find in history. Hopefully this book will provide ideas in future research at national or local levels.
3,Forever Young,"This is a good product. I was using Just For Men but on my last go around I had a severe allergic reaction. Outside of a mild tingle, Natural Instincts works and I like the color."
2,It's no party,"All I can say about ""TV Party"" is that it isn't. It's not ""your father's trivia book"", is a correct statement made by someone here. But then again, neither is this book entertaining nor informative.Some would argue that they like the inane and esoteric in this book. However, this is a poor excuse for a book that misses the mark in promising it's readers ""inside"" stories. Much of it is drivel. I had high hopes for this book. Maybe the next book will be better. If the author is reading this review, please, please do not rip people off by enticing your customers with a CD that promises so much but has so little to offer."
2,High expectations - low delivery,"When a book is read, you either like it or don't. The high energy rate of people fighting over the issue of whether this book is ""AWESOME"", ""THE BEST"" or other hyperbole is besides the point. Obviously, some people feel that if they like it, then YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT too. On the flip side, those who didn't like the book should take note likewise...to each his/her own.All I can say about TV Party is that I didn't like it one bit. It promises so much but delivers so little. I suppose that people who are desperate for nostalgia will like TV Party even if it was poorly done, which it is. The book has nothing to do with my personal tastes of how the book should have been written. My major complaint is what it promises and how it fails to deliver. The stories in the book are rubbish and are tabloid in nature. It ISN'T fun reading. Personally, I don't care how glowingly this book is reviewed here. I can only say that after reading TV Party, that it was no party at all."
2,Not very good,"This book has some good nostalgia but it isn't that good of a book. There are a few good stories about some of the old tv shows and characters, but most of it is fluff. Too much info on too many inane topics such as children's programing and Tallulah Bankhead?!! The CD is terrible and lackluster as well.If you really want information dealing with the old style tv programs, you would do better in just logging on to tvpary.com for free."
3,"For a Specific Audience, I Think--Good, in What it Covers","There's a lot of disagreement in the reviews on this book, and here's my guess as to why. This book seems to be generally focused on pop-culture TV of the 50s and 60s, and I think that has to have been your era (or at least your passion) for this book to be worthwhile. For me, it's not, but I think that's more a function of me growing up in the seventies and early eighties than anything else--if this book were focused on those eras of TV, I think I'd love this book as much as some of the other reviewers.My only real complaint, aside from my era-deficiencies, is the marketing of this book. If they specified what it covered, they might not have disappointed the folks they did.I'm glad I have this as part of my TV library, though, and I'm glad, too, that they might be releasing another one that might cover shows more in my TV timeline."
1,Well...,TVparty is a bottomless pit of understatement and frivolous detail. Horrible. Simply horrible.
1,Are we living in Iraq?,"Folks, at the risk of being tagged as some phantom reviewer, the truth is that I did not like the book. I think that conspiracy theories are interesting, but in an open forum like this, you have to take the good with the bad. Last time I looked, I was living in America where you could express your opinions without being accused of this or that.Some people think that this book is Sacred. Fine. Some people think that the book is toilet paper. Fine. But don't step on my blue suede shoes and try to take the validity of expressing my opinion here by dregging up some ridiculous theory about people writing bogus reviews. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen, for goodness sake. I've never seen such immature reviews (pro and con) in all my life. Is it that hard for you people to accept contrary opinions? Sheesh!!"
2,Some nice articles on old tv shows,"Nostalgia usually hits people with warm fuzzy feelings and this book has its share of them. All in all, I don't think the book quite hit its mark. I was entertained by a few stories but I was expecting much more since many of the reviews here had such high praise. I think the warm fuzzies that some people get by reading about their childhood memories overshadows the point that the book really isn't all that great. This is a great topic for a book and hopefully a better one will come along later."
1,What happened?,"Did you ever see the hype some movies generate and go expecting a blockbuster but end up leaving the theater disappointed and let down? That's pretty much how I felt after reading TVparty. I really wanted to like the book and tried my best to see the silver lining in the cloud, but the more I read and looked, the darker the cloud became. The book is a gigantic joke filled with tidbits of old stories unrelated to the topic at hand...television. If you are looking for a genuine book regarding television, try Joe Garner's ""Stay Tuned"". Not only is his book heads and shoulders above TVparty, it has an excellent DVD/CD combo with excerpts of landmark television episodes which is a far cry from the cheap and scant content of the TVparty CD, which is, in a word, a scam. It's very rare that I buy a book so terrible, but TVparty suckered me. My fault. I should have believed the other reviews. Oh, well. I can always use the book as a doorstop."
2,Could have been better,It's a fun look at the past and the book has a few interesting moments as well. I just felt that it needed some more polish and depth.
2,Didn't like it as much as I thought I would,"As a person who grew up during the baby boomer generation, I must say that I was very excited to receive my copy of TV Party. I've finished the book and it was lackluster at best, and boring at worst.I was not impressed with the quality and selection of ""untold stories"" with the exception of the article on Superman and a few of the early children's programs from the 1950's. I wish there were more to the book except the weak stories that were included in this volume."
2,Five stars? No way.,"There are a lot of misinformed individuals here. Either that, or the marketing department for TV Party is posting all the 5 star reviews on this site. :)Basically, this book could have been so much better if the author had been more determined in adding real value by adding more stories that were centered upon the old tv shows and characters. I found the book particularly lacking in this."
3,Fair but no cigar,"It is interesting to note the wide canyon of opinion here about this book. I guess it is a love it or leave it sort of book.Regardless, TV Party does not deliver as promised. It is a fair book, but it in no way is a fantastic book about the golden/silver era of television. The author hangs most of the weight of the book on several key stories revolving around certain tv personalities while the rest of the book is just filler. I would have to agree that there is a lot of info here that is not mainstream. However, this is not a strength of the book as much as it shows that the author used these items to just fill a book that was already weak in nature. I would rate this book a 2 1/2 star book mainly because the book and CD are not as entertaining as it could have been."
2,Where's the beef?,"There used to be an old tv commercial where an elderly lady would look into a hamburger bun and exclaim ""Where's the beef!"" The commercial was funny in that it was trying to demonstrate how certain burger companies overstated their claims of big and juicy burgers. As for TV Party, I would like to say ""Where's the Party?!"".TV Party is a valiant attempt to bring to the general public, some ""insider"" stories, but for the most part fails in execution and style. The stories are ok but not very well written. Much of the book was boring for me because a lot of the stories have to do with programming that I never saw or knew about when I was growing up as a kid. That is very odd, since I was pretty much a tv baby watching lots of television when I was growing up during the era this book is covering."
2,Looking forward to the next edition,I give tvparty a two star only because I think it is a work-in-progress. I really think that the idea of digging behind the scenes of old tv shows is a great idea. Just needs more work.
5,Fantastic!,"TVPARTY! brings together many of the best written and most interesting articles originally published on Billy Ingram's phenomenally popular TVPARTY website. What a fun book this is! I love it, and everyone I've shared it with gets a huge kick out of it. TVPARTY!: The Book is everything from a ""Whatever Happened to..."" guide to a ""Hollywodd Babylon"" of vintage television. If you love baby-boomer pop culture, you will adore TVPARTY!."
5,This is great!,"As someone with a particular interest in Women in television, this book caught my eye. With mini-bios and stories about Bette Davis, Ida Lupino, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Gertrude Berg and others, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think anyone in the industry will enjoy it as well. Very funny and informative!"
2,A little below average,"As a youngster, I remember sitting in front of the television set and watching all the classics such as I Love Lucy, Wagon Train, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best, and many others. Purchasing TV Party was my hope in re-entering the memories of my childhood. While the book presents a good treatment of certain subjects such as television shows for kids in the fifties, it is lacking in information regarding many of the really big hits of that era. This is where the book TV Party falls short. It is still an interesting look at the past, but there is a gigantic hole of untold stories regarding the major shows of the past. I might have given the book a three star rating just for effort, but the CD that was included with the book was very low in quality and content."
2,TVparty: Unfulfilled Tales,"I don't know, even at half price, I still feel it is not worth the money. The reviews here differ so widely that the truth has to lie somewhere in the middle. In the case of this book, most people are reacting on a emotional level than an objective level. The people who love this book gush about the warm memories etc, while the people who hate this book talk about how TVparty didn't meet expectations. I think I will fall on the side of not meeting my expectations. If you really look at this book objectively, it doesn't do what it says or advertises.The price of admission was not worth it because much of the info is pretty much common knowledge. Since I didn't get any warm fuzzies from the stories, I can only rate it in an objective manner. The book fails to deliver."
5,Blast from the past,"It's fitting that this book covers the Time Tunnel in it's pages. This book is a tunnel through my TV past and I loved every minute of it. From Andy's Gang to PLayboy After Dark to Lucy and Robert Blake, TVPARTY really lives up to its name.Especially entertaining are the pieces on Romper Rooom, Captain Kangaroo and the weird details surrounding the death of Alfalfa. Wildly pleasing and fun to boot, it's like being a fly on the wall of TV history!"
2,Leftovers for the book?,"I am a big fan of Billy's internet website, TV Party. I purchased the book because of the reputation and quality of his website. To make a long story short, the book seems to have articles and stories that are second rate. I think this is because there would be a conflict of interest if all the goodies found on the website were transfered to the book. As a result, the book contains much of the lower quality articles. People have to pay a fee to see the entire website, so if much of the good web-content were in the book, that would have brought down the subscriptions to his website. At least that is my theory. The book wasn't terrible, but neither did it meet my expectations. I think that with all the feedback that is here about how the book could be improved, I am hoping that the second edition, if there is to be one, will be much better."
1,Over rated book,"I am a big fan of nostalgia and the early televison shows of the 50's and the 60's and love to gobble up books and information related to these great eras of tv. I purchased this book and found that there was very little to like about it, even for a fan like myself. I found the book boring and shallow. Very little of the book covers the popular tv shows. What happened?!"
2,Disappointing,"An odd book that presents an interesting idea which the author tries to develop without success. Most of the book is spent exploring the characters' personal lives but without in any way relating them to the plot or subject matter of the book, so that we're left feeling that the author just let his mind wander. Unfortunately, the characters are flat and uninteresting, so their prolonged contemplations of their sexual and family problems, which have no bearing whatsoever on the subject or plot of the book, leave the reader bored and baffled. The mystery with which we're initially presented, involving Native American beliefs, the desecration of sacred sites, etc., is interesting and engaging but soon lost amid these meanderings and comes to seem a mere aside. The denoument of this mystery has no relation to anything that preceeds it and leaves the reader even more deflated. This book needed a sharp-witted editor to lead the author back to his subject matter. Disappointing."
5,Great new way to look at the tribulation,"I have read all of the left behind series and am very impressed with this new ""spin"" on how things may actually occur. Jerry Jenkins does an excellent job on a new insight into what life can become in a world of removal of church from state. I can not wait for the next book, this book leaves the reader knowing the things happening to the characters is of God. It is an excellent expression of man's struggle with faith and that God let's us know He is real. It is an excellent read."
4,Silenced... the second book of the Underground Zealot series.,"An excellent book and follow up to the first book 'Soon'. I wouldn't recomend this book if you haven't read Soon. Soon was amazing and this is following suit. I can't wait to read 'Shadowed', the third book in the Underground Zealot series..."
3,Awesome but really short,"There is a lot of text in the game, but you can skip through it very quickly if you want too. Amazingly fun and original with beautiful graphics. Cons are it is a very repetitive button masher, and it is wicked short. It took me two hours to beat the game on normal and I'm just an okay gamer. Each level was ridiculously short and flew byin a minute. The boss levels were cool by even the hardest ones were really easy to figure out how to beat. You pretty much only use one button when attacking."
4,I would give it a perfect but,"A nice a little game, but it's to short I still don't know how to fight that pegasus guy and I beat it twice on easy the story changed, but he still wasn't playable. Anyways it's probably the best side scroller I ever played for GBA he has seven special abilitys which you probably already know I might as will name them. Theres the arm cannon,sensors,fingerlaser,jets,he shoots bullets from his (...),his life, turbo attack. Also sometimes it temporarily slows down."
2,a bit boring,"We bought this toy for our 6 month old because we liked how tall it was. Unfortunately after a few minutes of poking and tasting, she gets bored of it. The head and feet are too difficult for her to pull out and there just isn't much to keep her stimulated. She has more interest in a ball or rattle."
2,don't waste your money,"We bought this for our son when he was 6 mts old. He seemed to like it in the store, or maybe my husband really liked it, anyway he hardly ever plays with it. He is now 9 mts and still has no intrest in it. I wouldn't waste your money on it."
2,tap bug,"I love Tiny Love products.But this item is totally a disappointment.The tap feature does not work.There's a seperate small cheap Chinese device in the middle of the product. I've plugged it out and tried to figure out how it works. But in order to make it work you have to hit it hard (I mean very hard). And It does not work when you put that device into the toy.In order to make it operate, you have to bang it very hard to the ground.."
3,Fine but not Fabulous,"There are some things that would interest a baby such as rings to slide, a crinkle flower, and a magnetic hand. The ball also has a cute face that vibrates when you pull it out. It does have some flaws unfortunately. The ball is supposed to make sounds, but it only does so when it is thrown or hit very hard. It isn't very sensitive to touch I guess. The head is also very hard to pull out."
2,Inaccurate,"I bought this in anticipation of a liver transplant. I knew I would have to take my temp several times a day in the weeks after the surgery. Unfortunately, this thermometer was horribly inaccurate. I could take my temperature one time and I would show that I was running a fever. I could reset it and take the temperature again and it would show that it was below normal. The fluctuation could be as much as 2 to 3 degrees at time. I even checked it against the thermometers used in the hospital and it was always off by at least 1 degree.Very inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Don't waste your money on this one - go with BD or another tried and true medical brand. Timex needs to stick to watches."
3,Not built to last,"When it works, it does work quickly and is reasonably accurate. However, I have been through 4 of these. Once, the display showed an error. The other 3 times the button stopped pushing in. It is like the red dot became flat and there is no longer a button to push. I have purchased 2 of these and the last 2 times I contacted the company and they did replace it for free. Of course, my 4th one now is not working so I need to find a more durable thermometer."
2,It Worked Once,"We actually bought this when I came down with the flu and no longer had the patience for a regular glass oral thermometer. It worked once, taking about 15 seconds to come up with a fairly accurate temperature. Then it sat for about four months and the next time we tried to use it, it would not register anything but ""Low."" If the battery is only going to last a couple of months, then although it isn't terribly expensive, it isn't worth what little we paid. Probably would be better if it took a AAA battery and had to be held for 12 seconds."
1,Might as well just guess your temperature.,"This thermometer is not accurate at all. I get a temperature variation of 5 degrees when doing successive readings. It will go from 101 degrees to 96 degrees, and just jumps all around, it is totally useless as a thermometer. Yes it is fast, but by fast all they did was program it to stop reading the temperature after 3 seconds or so, which means the reading is always still fluctuating; the stupid machine will not wait long enough for the temperature to normalize so that it can get an accurate reading.You are better off just guessing what your temperature is, that will be more accurate than this piece of garbage. The lesson perhaps is: don't buy medical equipment that is made in China.If you are sick or your temperature is important to know for health reasons, this thermometer could kill you. No joke."
2,"Fast, but not so accurate","The plus side of this thermometer is that it is amazingly fast at giving you your temperature. The downside, is its accuracy does not seem to match its speed. While I don't have a good way to calibrate the thermometer, I have tried taking my temperature a couple times in succession and gotten readings that vary by more than a degree. It also, on a couple of occasions, told me that my temperature is about 120F, which is unlikely as 105-6F will kill you."
4,Works Good,"It's fast, convenient, and fairly accurate. It gives a reading in under 10 seconds. I would have given it 5 stars but it isn't 100% accurate. I took different readings only seconds apart it and it gave me three different temperatures, although they were only .2 degrees away. A mercury thermometer always gives the same reading if taken at the same time.Fast - grade AConvenience - grade AAccuracey - grade B"
3,It broke the first day I used it,I bought 5 thermometers. The first day I used one it broke. The tip came completely off and the wires inside came out. I hope the other ones I ordered are not that cheap. I spent a lot of money on these because I thought they would last a long time.
3,This CD Rocks,"this CD appears to be a BEST OF, It has some really Good songs like ""True Colors"" check it out"
1,More about the Author then St. Hedwigs,"Book was very disappointing... there was almost a whole chapter of how the author stole his first bottle of whiskey...I was looking to hear more about the total operations of the orphanage system, not about the author."
5,WHAT A TUNE!,This has to be the best Italian dance tune eva. Heard it in the night clubs while on holiday there. All time classic cheezy tune! Buy it now! Prezioso and Marvin? - GEEEEEZA`S
3,ehhh,Not sure what I can say about a package of markers. They arrived on time and worked okay. wish they were cheaper
4,Good,Just bought these. Same size tip as regular size markers so I suppose the ink is what makes is King size. Don't write as well as the regular markers.
3,Dance of Death,"This is the kind of movie you watch in a cold, dark basement at three in the morning, perferably when raining.Its just that kind of movie.The last half hour make the movie worth while, the beginning is a bit slow, but has a build-up. The killer toys are creepy and create a great effect in the old mansion.ays black and white on the box, but it is color."
1,bogus info from supplier,This power supply did not fit the computer the supplier said it would. On the plus side they did allow me to return it.
4,A perfect gift,It took me time but I found this gem that I read from grade school library and know I am glade to have it in my personal library.
4,A fine pictorial future-history of spacecraft:,"""Spacecraft 2000-2100 A.D."" is a fine art/science fiction work in the form of a future history. The book is comprised of the work of some of the best science fiction artists of the day, tied together by fictional historical entries."
3,Future history of the World Trade authority 1999-2000,"Good short stories based around great graphic artwork great collectors item, if your into Chris Foss style Artwork."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This book as it suggests gives some technical detail on various diffrent classes of spaceship used in this future history, with some small amounts of background to go with it, as well as plenty of illustrations."
3,Pictures make this book of possible future spacecraft.,"It is my understanding that this book along with two others by Stewart Cowley, make a series which is worth $1000's.The reason, is the pictures. These books contain a very detailed collection of color drawings of possible, and mostly plausible, spacecrafts from our not too distant future.If you like spaceships, space related art, or just nice colorful pictures of a possible future, then this is a book to get."
2,Disappointed,"Based on everyone else's positive ratings of this book, I ordered A Garden in Paris hoping it would live up to those reviews. Sadly, it didn't. I found the character of Elizabeth extremely annoying- too petty, judgemental, and confrontational with her mother. The author relied too much on ""telling"" the story instead of ""showing""- through more dialogue and action. Despite the good premise, I couldn't make myself keep reading. I'd recommend Kissing Adrien or Chateau of Echoes by Siri Mitchell if you want some wonderful, French fiction."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this Christian Book that focuses on redemption, forgiveness and new starts. I am very interested in finding out what happens in the sequel ue out in 2006....left me wondering. Pick it up, it's a good one!"
2,Bland,"There is nothing special about this side dish. There is a hint of tomato, a hint of some other spices and a very vague ting of heat.The dish is VERY easy to prepare but there is nothing special about it nor anything terribly wrong either. There are no ""off-tastes"" - really there is not much taste - period.I'm afraid bland says it all. To call this dish ""Mexican"" seems terribly wrong. Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.At the right price I'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes. They are extremely easy to prepare, have no off tastes -- yet they are not stellar.My favorites in the Lipton/Knorr family are the Teriyaki Rice and the Stroganoff and Alfredo noodles."
5,Masses for the Convents and Parishes - Couperin,"A definitive recording of these Masses is a rarity and for the serious student of French classical liturgical interpretation, this is quite fine. I plan to consult other serious organists for their opinions."
4,5 star reviews are a mystery to me...,"While the read was enjoyable and well paced, I'm confused as to the abundance of 5-star ratings for this book. I felt the plot and identity of the Falcon was far too easy to pick out from very early on. Had I been younger and less apt to figure it out, I might have enjoyed it better. I give it a four-star rating though because Stefano was pure deliciousness. I do agree that this book would be excellent as a movie, and will nurse an unlikely hope that a talented filmaker will take it up as his next project."
3,A little cliche,An interesting read but too easy to figure out the plot. I actually thought it was a take off on Zorro. Nice writing.
3,"Entertaining novel, fast read",I like historic and romantic novels and this one fit the bill. Fairly well written and a fast read. Didn't take me long to finish it.
5,"Mystery, Italy and romance -- this book has it all!!","For anyone who has read and enjoyed a Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters novel,you will love this book. After her father's death, Francesca travels to Italy to live with a family she has never met. While there, Francesca learns about a mysterious rider called the Falcon who is trying to raise a rebellion against the aristocracy and papal ruling. Frencesca finds herself enthralled by the Falcon and even aids him in his cause but his identity remains a mystery even to her. This book has mysery, adventure, romance, and humor all rolled into one."
5,Loved It!!!,"As a new reader of Barbara Michaels, I must say this is my favorite of the three novels I've read so far (Wings of the Falcon, Stitches in Time, The Dancing Floor). I couldn't put this one down. It has romance, suspense, and vividly drawn characters that you come to care about. The twin brothers, Andrea and Stefano, are fascinating, as is the beautiful heroine, Francesca. The descriptions of Italy and the ""castello"" in 1860 are so good, you can easily picture yourself there. 5 stars!"
2,Norpro Cast Iron Corn Mold Pan,Poor quality....the slightest moisture quickly causes oxidation and it is very difficult to remove once that starts. The initial oiling and priming instructions were follwed to a tee so this should not have happened.
3,Does what it's supposed to do,"It does exactly what it's supposed to do... bake cornbread sticks. I give it a 3 because after a couple of months, some rust has started to collect in the cornstick molds-- and I always dry my cast iron thoroughly. It did not come pre-seasoned and I'm not sure if this product was USA made, probably not. I'm going to try the Lodge and see if it lasts longer."
2,MEGASHIFT,"This book completely held my attention as I said, ""Yes! Yes!"", to everything I read. The author put words around so many things I have thought and felt for many years. Truth rings out on every page as the author points out the Biblical way, without being condemning nor judgmental."
5,Great read!,"A must for anyone concerned with the ""how's"" & ""why's"" of our current state of affairs as Chirstians. Great examples of belief! I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Fun Read,"I could not put this book down and was sorry when I finished it! I wanted more!! Perhaps Bagshawe can write a sequel? I'd love to know what happens to Lilly & Henry, Janet & Ed, Charles & ??, and of course Anna & Mark. I had so much fun reading this. The put-upon Anna finally finds the courage to go after what she wants in her career and in love, and proves that you don't have to be selfish, manipulative or mean to win.Sounds like other books, but these characters are British and the story takes place in London with all the requisite cultural references and local flavor (or is it 'flavour'?).You can depend on Bagshawe for a fun read. I don't think I've read anything of hers that I did not enjoy. Great for long flights, commuting on subway/bus, or a beach read."
2,Neither a pro nor a rookie,"If you are an advanced/interm. player you will certainly want to pass on this one. It does not have any advanced material that I have found would be worth watching.For beginners, I am afraid it is not simple or detailed enough. You would think bignners program would show in more DETAIL and CLOSEUP the position of the foot when kicking the ball which is not the case. This is the most CRUCIAL part about kicking/shooting. Position of feet, the point of contact with the ball!If you are a BIGNNER and need a DETAILED program on how to kick the ball then I'd recommend ""Just Kickin' It"". It is made for beginners and very simple and easy to learn."
1,Beware ¡¡¡¡¡¡,"Are a very bad quality balls, with the minimum strong hit the ball has problems, in a small time you will have damages. It's not a good idea to buy this item."
2,Poor battery and non working charger,Got it instead of getting net book. I had to buy another battery for 30$ as the battery does not hold charging also I had to buy another charger as the charger does not fit well for another 12$. The laptop itself works well and in moderate condition
5,my new mac,it's my first mac and i just love it it's fast it's cheep and there are so many ways to use it. i love this mac and i all ways will
3,Not for me,I was thaking this after it was recommended for my rhinitis. Took a while to connect back to it but over the course of the next several months my periods became extremely irregular. My doc even got approval for me to see a specialist. Than I was diddling around on the Internet and found a reference that bromelain can do this. I stopped the supplements and everything went back to normal.
1,Product makes me ill,"I don't have Hashimoto's, and relatively few allergies, but this product makes me nauseous and upsets my regularity. It made me feel funky all day. I tried it three different times, with different foods, different times of the day, and once without food. All three times had the same effect. I threw the rest away. It might have been a bad batch?"
3,Not sure if it worked for me or not..,I looked into a lot of reviews before buying this and was very optimistic about it. But I am really not sure if this thing has worked for me or not.
2,product info,What is the breakdown of the content of quercetin and bromelian ?The information page does not state this ?
3,Decent Product,"I ordered this due to a sinus infection and soar throat that wouldn't quit for 6 weeks or more. I had been to the doctors and finished my course of anti-biotics and was still suffering. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and bought this and Nature Biotic Grapefruit Seed Extract. I started taking the Quercetin w/ Bromelain first for several days w/ no effect in and of itself but when I added the GSE, within 24 hours my soar throat was gone. I have been continuing to take this product every day and while we are still in the spring season here in Phoenix, I have not add any further sinus discomfort."
1,Not For Me,"Unfortunately, I could not tolerate this product, probably due to a hypothyroid condition - Hashimoto's disease - so I would caution against taking this product in this case."
5,seems to be helping,I started taking this along with freeze dried stinging nettles and have been definitely seen improvement with my sinus pain and allergy symptoms.
5,illegal...illegal..illegal,"This is it the best album from Grobschnitt. I have the original disco 12"", this CD is very good."
1,I don't recommend this book,"I do not find the idea of tormenting cats, which is basically what the author suggests, funny, even if the cats are not physically harmed. The humor of this escapes me. Therefore, I do not recommend this book. The author gives his e-mail address in the book and I also sent him an e-mail about this."
1,Not for cat lovers,"Does Mr. Katz have cats? I doubt it - they've probably run away. Even though the suggestions are made in fun (I hope) they are potentially harmful. In the hands of a wrong person this book may transform into a book of horrors for a good-natured friendly cat. Mr. Katz may want to ask himself if he would like to have these suggested tricks played on him by someone 6 times taller and perhaps 12 times heavier. As suggested in the last pages of this book, don't let the SPCA see you doing any of these things to your cat. My copy of this book is in the city garbage dump where it will not give anyone ideas of torture. This one would never be donated to the library."
4,Gonin,"An odd and unusual film to say the least... But a good one nonetheless. Some people will likely be turned off by this film due to the violence, and the surreal & gloomy feel which rarely lets up. I happen to like that sort of thing, so it worked out pretty well for me. This film actually reminded me a lot of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (vise versa actually), with their great film noir like feel. Reading some of the other reviews, I saw that a few people said they were turned off by the 'homoerotic nature' of the film. The movie has a few 'not-so-straight' (Amazon won't let me use the G-word :) characters (including Takeshi, who is excellent!), but it's nothing I would label as 'homoerotic'. I'm as straight as they get and the film didn't bother me any... It's nothing anyone hasn't seen before in Pulp Fiction or The Crying Game. Anyway, Gonin is a great film which I do recommend... Though some of you may want to rent it first :)."
2,This IS REALLY GAY!!,"This movie is perfect for all you bisexual guys out there. If you get turned on by homerotic films, this is for you. But me, like most people am not bisexual. I do not recomend this to most people. I bought this crap in chinatown, thinking WOW! A Beat Takeshi movie $5. I am a fan so I had to buy it. Little did I know it turned out to be a little bit too far out for me. My advice don't get it. I have since, given this movie to a bisexual guy next door. Instead get Violent Cop or Fireworks."
2,"A little boring for kids, but pretty good for coach","I bought this DVD to show to my U10 boys team when our practice is rained out. I watched it myself first and it was a bit boring. It's like watching a regular practice session of a high school team. There isn't a whole lot of pizaz that would get boys excited and hardly any real game footage showing passing. Machanics I can teach myself, but having the boys see how and when passing is done in a real, high level game is something I can't easily do and that's what I was looking for."
5,Lo mejor de Sabina,"Estoy un poco confundido con respecto a este CD, porque ya aparece otro mas caro y con las mismas canciones. Si mi teoria es correcte, este debe de ser la version argentina del disco, la unica difernacia que tiene es que agrega la cancion ""la biblia y el calefon"" que es una de rutina para Sabina y cambia ""Cerrado por derribo"" por ""nos sobran los motivos"" que es una version de la misma cancion pero con diferentes versos y mas ritmica. Es mas para lo que hallan ido a algun concierto de él recientemente, esta es la vercion que canta y tiene versos maravillosos ""...este trailer de mudanzas con los muebles del amor..... este perro andaluz sin domesticas"". Vale la pena y mucho mas por ese precio"
5,Best Ever!,This is my favorite vanilla perfume ever! My husband and co-workers also love it. They are always saying I smell like a big sugar cookie when I wear it! :)
1,"I agree, waste of money","I agree with the other two reviewers who said that this two-year service plan is unnecessary. The camera already comes with a warranty to begin with so you are overlapping things if you buy the two year plan because it begins on the day you buy it. The part about credit cards offering extended warranties is true, also. And, normally most problems and defects are going to make themselves known earlier on rather than later, so it would most likely happen during the camera warranty period anyway. Repairs that happen outside of the warranty period are often due to user error or damage so this wouldn't be covered anyway.The prior reviewer who seened to think this was a good idea only gave the two year warranty 3 stars. If it is such a good idea, why only three stars?"
4,7-Keto,"So far, so good! I didn't start taking them right off the bat, but I can tell a difference in how I am looking in just a few weeks. I am of coarse, still exercising, but the difference is noticeable to me. I also feel like I have a little more energy without needing as much caffeine during the day. I will be buying more."
2,Was disappointed that I didn't see any results,After seeing this product on Dr. Oz I was excited to try it but I saw no results at all.
3,"Maybe it works, I am not sure.","I take several suppliments to help me with Fibromyalgia which causes pain and sleep. This stuff seems to help me be more wakeful. I know Benfotiamine, the only fat soluble B worked the first day I took it and unlike a niacin flush I knew the vitamn worked everyday following.I am testing and will let you know."
1,Not working yet,I started taking this 30 days ago at the same time I started taking Relora. I have not lost any weight or noticed any difference. I am going to give it one more month and will post again at that time.
1,WASTE. OF. MONEY.,"I've used this product for the past 2 months and I lost a grand total of (wait for it...) ZERO pounds. It does not do anything! At all. Just a waste of money. I run several times a week and eat mostly healthy. I've hit a plateau and thought this might jumpstart my weightloss again, but NOPE. Learn from my mistake and don't buy it."
2,Not worth it!,So not worth it. Do not waste your money. Didn't do a thing for me. I used the whole bottle just like it said & couldn't even tell that I had taken it. Didn't make me feel any different either.
5,Boost of Energy,"Delivered as promised. This product is good for people who need a natural boost of energy. Taken twice daily, I don't have worry about having energy for my evening activities."
4,7-keto,"7-keto seems to be pretty good. I haven't taken it for long, but I feel it is making a difference in my waiste line. Thnak you amazon."
1,Bait and switch,"I ordered the NOW brand that was advertised and recieved an entirely different and cheaper brand. Have gotten my money back and was told,""to keep it,"" in his reponse. No other explanation. I am sure that he thought at the price of 11.98 no one would take the time to complain like I did and just be lazy enough to accept it without complaint. Beware of this seller."
1,Waste of money.,"This product is a waste of money. I did not notice one ounce of difference in my energy, weight, skin, etc. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,great item,My throid Dr told me to purchase this product to enhance my prescription thyroid medication. I have problems with my thyroid overall and then with my T3 and T4 so I purchased this item to help. In the past few months I feel 100% better!
3,Could tell no difference,"I have taken this product for almost a month now and compared to other brands, this on falls behind. i usually can tell that i am taking 7Keto Dhea but can't with this brand so i will not be buying it again. I know for sure that Integrative therapeutics works at a much lower dose (25mg) even though it is a bit pricy"
2,Not for me,"Initial weight loss of 6 lbs first week, then side effects became noticeable. These are irritability, increased body and facial hair and skin breakouts. Just not the solution for me."
3,lookout for side efects,"saves muscle mass ,feel a little tighter in some areas but the migraines that come with it are not worth it.if you are using this take a low dose."
2,No noticable difference,"I've had these around three months. Took them daily for about two weeks and didn't change my eating habits or exercise routine. I saw no noticeable difference and did not lose any weight nor did I feel I had more energy. I've recently started taking them daily for almost three weeks. I've lost 15lbs BUT I also significantly changed by eating habits and have been working out (sweating) daily so I would guess the results could have been obtained the old-fashioned way (diet and exercise), without the pills. I won't be refilling.On the positive side, they did ship quickly and the pills didn't do any harm but I am disappointed that the reviews from the Dr. Oz were so high when the actual results (at least for me) were pretty non-existent."
2,No Noticable Difference,"I purchased this product based on information that suggested it would help reduce body fat. I have taken it as directed for 30 days and have seen no change in weight, etc."
1,Not working,I have been using this product for three months now and have not noticed any changes. I was hopeful after hearing about it on Dr. Oz but feel that I wasted my money.
1,Nothing,"Again, this was recommended by Dr. Oz. This was another disappointment. It did absolutely nothing. I'm starting to question Dr. Oz's recommendations now."
5,Great Product - Great Company,"Another great product from a reliable company. Delivery is swift and I have been taking this for about 5 months. I swim 2 to 3 miles daily, and the combination of Forskolin, 5-HTP, Iron with B VItamins and 7-Keto seem to keep up my energy levels. Thank you, Dr. Oz for your recommendations."
3,Made me hot and jittery,"I would definitely be very careful when taking this supplement. I did experience a boost of energy with this, but at the cost of serious sweaty hot flashes and kind of a hyper state. Not what i was going for but since i can't have caffeine, i might take this in a pinch if i'm really tired but not as a regular supplement."
2,Sadly didn't work,"After taking this product I did not notice any change in how I felt. For me, this product did not work."
2,No Results,"I heard about 7-Keto on the Dr. Oz show. I've been trying to lose 10 pounds by doing cardio exercise 3-4 times per week, and I was hoping this product would speed up my metabolism to help me lose 10 pounds. I took 7-Keto for 60 days and did not lose even 1 pound. I would not recommend this product."
3,7-Keto,"Expected the product to help with my losing pounds; but it has been slow, even with exercise and proper diet."
1,7-Keto,"If you are looking for something to help burn body fat, look someplace else.This product does not work as advertised.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Worthless,"I started taking this product after seeing Dr. Oz praise its healthful benefits on his TV show. So I ordered it, took the precise dosage Dr. Oz suggested - and after one month, the only change I noticed in my body was that this 7-Keto stuff negatively affected my sleep. NO leaning out, NO feeling better (and I even keep a very healthy diet, and work out regularly!). Maybe this supplement will work for you, but I think it's pretty worthless, and I will think twice before listening to Dr. Oz again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I heard about this from Dr. Oz and while I'm not saying that 7-Keto does not work, this particular brand does not. You certainly get what you pay for -- it was cheap and didn't do a thing."
2,Doesn't help,"I've been taking this for the past month with no change in my weight. I, like many, heard about it from Dr. Oz and ordered after his show. Don't waste your money, just diet and exercise."
2,No Results,"These will be a no-no for me, gave no results neg or positive, was disappointed! didn't use the full bottle"
3,Who needs T supplements? oops! longer term use: no effect,"Update: Apparently the effects I felt were psychosomatic. The longer I used the more i felt the way I had before acquiring the product. I think probably it would be best for short term use during dieting or initial exercise program, rather than to expect longer term benies.Previous review:This product gives me energy, seems to help with solving the problem of slightly low thyroid function and seems to help control appetite. I think it also gives me better energy for my weight workouts. Whether this is psychological or pharmaceutical I cannot say, but it works for me, a 62 year old man. I recommend you try it if your issues reflect these. The suggested dosage is 2 times a day; I seem to do fine with one a day and two only occasionally.Delivery was fantastic and the price was better than I had seen anywhere else."
4,Keto-great,This is my second bottle of 7-Keto and I love it. I got the idea from Dr. Oz and it really works!
2,Forget the pills. Exercise and write down everything you eat.,"This is Joe's wife: I turned 50 yrs old, quit smoking in May & started walking while punching & then I jog until I need to stop & then I walk/punch, jog, etc... I didn't gain weight, but wasn't losing any so I started taking 7-KETO in June. Took it for 2 mths. It didn't do anything for me. It's a waste of money. End of August I amped up my walking/jogging to 40 to 45 minutes. I also swim 4 to 5 laps after walking. This is my cool down & stretch time. I started writing down everything I eat. I hung this on the fridge so I would be sure to do it & I see what I've eaten before I eat. I've lost 8 pounds in 4 weeks.If you want to lose weight - you have to Get Up & MOVE. Eat fruits & veggies. A little lean meat. Avoid processed foods. There's no quick fix. Anything good takes time. AND I feel great! I have energy. I'm glad I changed my life style."
1,Wasted my Money,I purchased this product because it was touted to help with energy and weight loss. It was recommended on the Dr. OZ show and I was hopeful it would work. But for me in had absolutely no impact--can't tell a difference whether I take it or not. Save your money before buying this one.
2,terrible diarrhea!,"After 2 weeks of two tablets a day with meals, noticed my bowels getting looser & looser. After 3 weeks, total liquid bowel movements, not always able to control! Have stopped taking but considering one tablet everyother day.I have, however, lost 10 pounds on the Dukan Diet & 7-KETO."
2,Not the results I had hoped for....,"That is about all I can say...some people say it works, some don't. I don't. I was disappointed in the product."
2,Don't waste your money.,"After taking the raspberry ketone supplement, the only thing lighter was my wallet. Weight loss does not come in a bottle. Stick with healthy eating and exercise!"
1,"again, save your money","Just another supplement that our dear Dr. Oz recommended,so I had to try it. When will I ever learn? Did nothing for me!"
1,substitutes without permission,"I ordered the NOW brand of 7-Keto-60 cap bottles(which I had used in the past)....which is NOT what I received....I received a substitute brand in 30 day supplies....while I received the order quickly, I was not happy about the substition-but decided to try it...I am not liking the side effects from the replacement which has enhancements...I will be contacting the seller to return unopened portions of this order."
1,NO CHANGE,"7-keto Weight Management capsules did not increase my metabolism to lose weight. I will use up what I have, But will not continue to purchase."
1,Don't Buy,This stuff doesn't work and you can trust my review. I am not on here posting fake reviews on placebos.
2,waste of money.........,"waste of money.........NOW Foods 7-Keto Lean 100mg, 60 Vcaps....may work for others not for me...I could not recommend these maybe they will work for others I just gave up on them!`"
2,Whatever ...,"I am not overweight by much . . but I could stand to lose 10 lbs or so. I thought I'd try this after seeing it on the Dr. Oz Show. I measured my waist, hips and thighs before taking this product. It's been a month and haven't noticed much difference. Maybe taking it longer will produce the results I was looking for. I may reorder since it's so easy to use and see how I feel about this product then."
3,7-KETO 100mg,"I have been faithfully taking the product since June, approximately a month, and I can't really say that I have seen much change. In order to lose weight, I have also had to exercise regularly, eat more fruit and vegetables and almost give up carbs. I found that whenever I added carbs, or sweets to my diet for a few days,any weigth that I did lose, came right back. This is quite frustrating to me. The product is ok, but I am not sure that I would purchase it again. The truth is, for me, I have to give up the foods that I love to keep the 2-5 lbs that I lost, because the day that I add carbs, or sweets to my diet, whatever I lost comes right back. I think that this product will help people, but not without a low fat, low carb, low sugar, and regular exercise. We really have to stop fooling ourselves about believing anything else."
2,still the same,"cant tell any difference. took it for a month and still feel the same as i did before. i also take other pills so i dont want to stop taking all of them, to find out. i eat very healthy food so maybe that is all i need."
2,7-Keto Hype,"This product did not deliver. I used it for almost a month but no changes to my weight. Dr. Oz said this product has no side effect is not correct, at least in my case. 30 minutes after taking the capsule, I get sooo sluggish and could barely focus. My eyes just want to close like my brain is not getting enough oxygen and I noticed I've been eating more than normal. I ordered 3 bottles because it was endorsed by Dr. Oz but, I realized not to get so excited of the product that you haven't tested. I gave one bottle to my co-worker and she too and did not noticed any changes on her weight but she also noticed and increase appettite. Maybe it works on others but, certainly not for me and my co-worker. ML-Cocoa"
2,Bought to assist in Weight Loss,Did nothing for me. I took the whole thing exactly as I was told. Taste was ok. No side affects. A bit expensive. But I may need another bottle. Saw on Dr Oz show so I thought I'd try it.
1,Don't Waste your Money,Does not work! I am losing faith in Dr. Oz. I have purchased several of his recommendations and nothing as seemed to work
5,Energy,"I started taking 7Keto after I watching Dr. Oz talk about it on his TV show. After I turned 50 a few years ago, I began putting on belly weight gain & have had low energy levels. After taking 7Keto for just over a month, I can honestly say, my energy has increased substantially and instead having to lay down for a power nap midway through the day to make it to bedtime, I no longer need to..I've added workouts to my schedule as well, plus I have the energy to other activities in the evenings that I enjoy. It does not make me jittery like too much caffeine would. If fact, I do not even need that extra caffeine boast in the afternoon like I did in the past. It certainly is working for me!"
5,works great,THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT. REALLY GETS YOUR ENERGY BACK UP AND GOING. I WILL BE REORDERING THIS WEEK I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE OVER 45 YEARS OLD WITH LOW ENERGY LEVELS.
1,Did not work for me,I was really hoping this would give me some extra energy. I didn't notice any difference taking this supplement.
3,This does what?,"After finishing my first bottle, I'm still not sure what this is supposed to do for me. A couple of times I got a little bit of a hot flash sensation--not unpleasant but noticeable. But other than that, nothing to speak of. Individual body chemistries vary quite a bit, so if you have a couple $$ to spend, you might have a different experience."
1,No effect,"I don't believe the positive reviews about this product because I've been taking it for the last month with ZERO changes in my energy, weight, or anything else."
1,Dr. Oz Recommendation,"This product was supposed to help with alertness and weight loss however, that was not the case on my end. I heard to buy this from DR. OZ he highly recommended it but, I did have been taking it for about a month and it really is not effective for me I have not lost any wait or don't see any changes in my appetite it actually gets me more hungry so, this is not what I'm looking for. I don't know if it takes like 6 months to see results or if it just does not work on my body."
1,A Waste of your Money,"We heard about this product on Dr. OZ (a different brand BUT STILL 7-KETO) and how it really helped stimulate weight loss. We followed the directions exactly and in three weeks NOTHING - even with more exercise and less food - NOTHING. Our opinion, a WASTE of your MONEY!"
1,Not Yet,"Just about finished with second bottle. See no significant change. I do use the treadmill six days a week for exercise. Will take the third bottle and if no significant change occurs, I was duped again."
4,7-Keto Works For Me,"I have been using this brand of 7-Keto for a few months now and definitely works for me. It helps me with energy level and with that been able to drop about 15 pounds in the last 2 months. My sister, brother-in-law and husband and I are all using this product. We all recommend it if you're desire is to increase your metabolism."
1,Hard to tell...,"It's hard to tell if this product actually works. The description claims that it ""aids the body in its ability to burn fat and naturally supports the production of lean muscle mass"". well, if you're already working out (weight training and cardio) and eating a healthy diet, this will happen anyway, so I personally think this is a waste of money."
1,7-keto,I tried this with forskolin for 2 months and didn't see any results. I love Dr. Oz but this didn't work for me.
2,Didn't work for me!,I tried this but saw no difference in my appetite. I took this with saffron as directed by Dr. Oz for weight loss. It did not affect my appetite at all.
3,ok,"i felt like i had more energy, but didn't lose much weight, maybe i needed to take it after i was done"
2,Didn't notice any difference,I took the product as directed and nothing. No difference. I worked out 5 days a week as usual and still nothing.
2,Diet pills,"Curved my appetite a little but did not lose the weight. I was disappointed. Won't try them again. Unless you just want to curve appetite and not lose weight, then this would be the product."
3,Hmm,Well I haven't purchased this product again for myself and again I'm not too sure how many days you are suppose to take the product before seeing and feeling the results.
2,Adverse reaction - I couldn't take this.,"Something contained in the capsules resulted in an adverse reaction for me. I have eczema and sensitive allergic reactions to certain products, and this was one of them."
3,NO WEIGHT LOST!,"I took 7-Keto 100 Mg for two months after watching The DR OZ Show and thought of giving it a Try, and after Two Months I lost no weight at all, I only took 1 capsule every day instead of two as the bottle indicates, However, I still thought I would have lost some weight...but Nothing. I think this is pretty much like Raspberry Ketones, I had no success with that either. I did not go on a Strict Diet or Exercise Program and I think that makes a lot of difference because 7-Keto by itself does Nothing on Me! and since it works well on some other people that's why the three stars rating. Thank You"
4,Timothy of the Cay Review,"This is the amazing prequel-sequel to The Cay. This is the great book that explains Timothy's life before The Cay and Phillip's life after. It also explains about little Stew Cat. I like this book because it has a little bit of every genre(not fantasy). I would rate this with 5 stars, but it does have a confusing part. Please read Timothy of the Cay and you will love it!"
4,Timothy of the Cay T.O.T.C.,"This book is about a man named Timothy and a boy named Phillp.It starts when Phillp boat is bomb by Nazies an hes stuke on the island with a blck man named Timothy and they'er both on the same island named the cay.so then Timothy and Phillp became best friends Timothy took good care of Phillp becuase he was blind.Then a big hurrican came on the cay and only Philp was alive cause Timothy saved him.so Phillp is on the island for three mounths but then a rescue ship came to get Phillp.Then the book goes back to when Timothy was a little boy growing up then to Phillps life now.Phillp character was strong,brave,and a surviver.Then Timothy the same.Someone my age should read this book cause its real and educational for kids my age."
4,Ashley's Book review,"Dear Reader,Timothy of the Cay is a good book for children to read. My story was about a blind boy he got stuck on a island. Two strong men came to get him and took him home were he blong with his mother and father.Your pal,Lanay Pelswack"
1,Timothy of the cay,"Timothy of the CayTimothy of the cay is like the sequal and precual. I didnt like the book at all because the organization of the book is very boring and horrible book and because like one chapter is Timothy life and an other life is Phillip. Some parts are interesting but other part are very boring. The book has surving and conflict. I think the author needs to have first a book explaining the life of Timothy then ""the Cay"" and then the life of Phillip after being rescued from the deserted cay. I would recomend this book at the people that like books that in one chapter tell something and in another one is different."
1,Not nearly as god as the first book,"I really enjoyed the first book. So, I thought I would read the second book, which was suprisingly a lot worse. The first book had adventure, drama, and a main topic. The second book lacks every one of those things. I thought the parts about Timothy were very boring and didn't interest me one bit. I understand it was important to talk about Timothy as a young boy, growing up with racism, but, the author made it very boring. The parts about Phillip were a little more interesting, simply because it is from the point of view of a blind person. Personally, I would just suggest reading The Cay again, instead of reading a very boring book."
4,Delicate favorite...,One of my grandaughter's absolute favorite items. Adorable plush and very nice video story. The only drawback is that it is a bit delicate for the active play of the preschool child and has a tendency to tear at the seams. We've sewed hers back together more than once and she still loves playing with it.
5,"Old Stuff, New Sound","These are familiar pieces but right from the beginning the Labeques prove a novelty, not only in more lively quicker tempos, but in articulation, sound & frazing. The recorded sound is excellent. Very highly recommended."
5,"I wasn't shocked, I was in love","This, for me, was not a shockumentary. Maybe it would have been in its time, but all I felt from seeing this film was great love for these people, in all their splendour and beauty.This is the film you'll watch if you're looking to see people living traditionally. It is one of a few documentations we have today that shows us something that will possibly be extinct in later times. These people's lives are changing today and maybe one day we won't see them like this any more. That is why I liked this documentary - because I was seeing something that is rare to see in this time."
1,pants ripped from crotch to feet after first use,"its been 3 weeks since I bought this suit, the pants ripped the first use from the crotch all the way down to the feet after running. I still wear the top half every day, and the pants I put on over long johns and wear sweats over the top of everything. Was coming here to buy another cause I'm just gonna throw these away but after reading all these reviews, it seems this is a common thing with this particular brand. I would think Valeo would have taken these off the market by now if this is whats gonna happen. Do not purchase."
1,One time use,I used it one time and the pants ripped. Really?? It could be made better. It worked for a good 10 minutes.
1,waste of money,"After the first workout the crotch had two quarter size holes... out came the duct tape. After the third workout both legs were split along with the crotch, which exhibited an artistic waistband to rear pattern... and I thought duct tape was undefeated! The problem with this suit is/ are the poor seams. The vinyl is heavier than most suits. For what you pay, it will run you about $4.00 a workout if everything goes well before it hits the bottom of the trash can. Buyer beware!"
4,Good quality,"I've used it a few times. Apparenty being 5'4"" and 140lbs is too small for this suit. I don't get the full sauna-like benefits since the suit is too loose around my wrists and ankles, but if I wear boots and weights on my limbs I can get the full effect. Damn, I have to wear this outside."
2,THE PANT WERE BROKE,"INMEDIATELY WE USE IT, IT BROKE IN MIDDLE OF THE LEGS, I DO NOT KNOW HOW REPAIR ITTHANKS YOU"
4,Customer Service request,"Customer service dept.Dear Sir/Madame: I have recently purchased a Valeo Sauna Suit. I wish to advised that I have been totally satisfy with the results and the product, and share it with the people in the office, in fact they were planning to order when they saw mine, in other words I was a proud customer, I regret to say however and to my dissapointment the product did not last more tha 8 uses each time 1 hour, please be advised that on each occasion thights were use under the Valeo Sauna Suit. To my dismay while i was walking the inner seam came apart about 12 inches on the right and the left side about 4 inches, needless to say I was quite embarrased, I felt a great degree of dissapointment with the product. I'm hoping that through this complain you will seriously consideer a replacement or reimbursement for the cost and shipping.regardsSandra Fonseca"
4,Great Item,"This item has proven to be an absolute blessing. Since working out in it, I have lost 10 lbs.Thanks."
5,Sauna suit,These are the best sauna suites to work out with P90X my other ones always ripped after a month. I bought two so I will have a backup when I wear one out.
2,Valeo Sauna Suit,"First off its just a plastic suite. The price does not match up with the product, but since I needed and all the Walmarts and targets were out, I decide to buy it online. It took nearly 2 weeks for me to receive it."
1,they forgot to tell u this item causes cancer in the description...,I opened the package and there was a tiny note hidden in the box that said THIS PRODUCT MATERIALS CAUSE CANCER AND REPRODUCTION PROBLEMS....really? Maybe u should have listed a warning about that....not maybe cause cancer but DOES! !!! I'm horrified that this can be sold and I'm sending it back!
1,Buy something else,Materials are not durable at all. Pants ripped in the first workout. Definitely stay away from this product.
1,"Well, Mine ripped too!","So, I read the reviews and I had used Valeo before with no issues. I dont know what they changed, but sure enough the suit ripped within 15 min. This product really sucks now and I could not possibly suggest this to anyone. TO those who have had it and it is fine, congrats. But honestly, why take the chance when there are others."
2,suit tore on 1st workout,I wore this suit one time and it did not out last my workout. Luckly I had on black tights under my suit or everything would have been showing. I did give them a 2star rating because i did sweat a lot b4 it tore and I am currently serving in Iraq and this company does ship to APO address and many do not.
2,Ripped,"The suit is not bad, but the pants was quite cheap, because it ripped already. The upper part seems to be fine, but the pants ripped in the seams and other parts."
3,Not a cold winter option,"I'm sure that this will work when things warm up, right now it has been too darn cold to really appreciate any effect."
3,A bit dissapointed :(((,"Sorry to say but I was disappointed with this DVD. The quality itself was really bad. MAybe I just got a bad copy of a DVD but also the way the material was presented did not appeal to me. Not the fitness and instructional value(really good) but the overall presentation (looks very low budget). Shawn covers a lot of spins and pole dancing moves in comparison to other stuff out there. She moves very well and I am sure she is a great dancer. I wish the DVD would have a bonus material where you could actually see her freestyle. There is always something you may find useful for your practice but I find it too expensive for what is has to offer. If the DVD was for like $15, even $20 then I would not mind but it cost over 30!!!"
2,Disappointed,"Have to say I was a little disappointed in this dvd. The quality was not very good, almost looked like a homemade video. And I was surprised that the 3 routines at the end were so short. I had taken a class and was expecting longer routines. She does go over safety very well, as well as showing you each move. But I don't think it was worth the price."
5,Portrait of a gambler and the mob,"Eugene Izzi's style is as fresh today as it was when he first wrote this novel. His characters are believable, authentic, and interesting. A great read!"
4,"Well, OF COURSE IT'S GOOD!!!!","First off, I am a girl...but the show still rocks!!! Secondly, I do not own this DVD, but I have seen all five of the episodes on it. I have the complete first season of Yu-Gi-Oh 6-disc box set, and I love it, so I say it's better to wait (who knows how long) until the entire second season is out in the same context.Besides those circumstances, the five episodes that are on this DVD are some good ones, especially Mime Control. This is one of those duels that are really annoying to watch on TV cuz you just want to see it all at once just cuz it's so good!!!Anyway, hope this review is helpful....."
4,Great episodes but labeled wrong,"This is a great volume to make sure you have in your collection. Seeing Yami/Yugi duel against Marik is always fun.But, the episodes seem to be labeled wrong here on Amazon.com.It is 5 episodes, like it says. The box has 2 episodes listed as ""bonus."" To make you feel special, I'm sure.But as I was saying, Amazon lists is as Weevil's Web for the first 2, then Mime Control parts 1-3. That's not what I got. This volume is Mime Control parts 1-3, and then Legendary Fisherman parts 1 & 2.So, I don't know why they're listed that way. I even saw someone else's review that said the same episodes Amazon did, but it didn't seem to make sense as I tried to complete my collection of Yu-Gi-Oh!So, yeah, the Mime Control are great episodes and well worth adding to the collection. Legendary Fisherman, eh, not the best, but I'm glad I've got them. :)"
5,MUST read EVERY night to my son!!!,"Lyrical, magical, sweet and lilting, this book is a pleasure to read every single night to an almost 2 year old boy. (...)."
3,reasonable,This product is reasonable priced for what you get. My turtle seems to eat it though not as much as if it were fresh food. The best feature is that it doesn't spoil like other canned turtle foods that I've tried. You can give the turtle as much or little as you need without worrying about wasting your money.
2,"5* Shipper, But Food Disappointing","I ordered this food for turtles in a manmade pond next to my house. The food looked the same as the ones I had purchased before, with one BIG difference: The food SINKS like a STONE. You toss and the turtles think you're trying to harm them! It sinks to the bottom, they stare at you as if to say, where's the food? Then swim away. The food turns to mush at the bottom, ignored by the turtles. Very disappointing as I enjoy watching the turtles eat the food that floats on top.One bright spot: The shipper her shipped EXTREMELY fast! Received in a few days after ordering."
1,Not what I was expecting,This watch isn't what I was expecting. The face is extremely hard to read at all times. The only viewing angle that works is to tilt it toward or away from you. The light is the same way. The size of the watch is also decieving. It is very thick and donut like. I would not recommend this watch and am sorry I bought it.
5,Loved this story,"I enjoyed reading this story and the only thing I would recommend is the author go back in to the Kindle version and clean up the misspelled ""torn"" is showing as tom and also ""corner"" is showing as ""comer"" also there are class notes above some of the chapters."
4,good read,"Dominique is a bit clueless that her evil brother could possibly really be causing all the trouble he is accused of, but generally I did like the plotline and the character development of the twin brothers who would be Lord and the one woman who would be the lord's wife. There are some typos that need to be cleaned up."
4,Too many $50.00 Words,"This book so far is a good book, but I've spent a lot of time looking up words that were used, that appear to be excessive. Most of us read these types of books for enjoyment, not an education. I stopped about half way through the book to write this review. I love the mid evil romance novels and have spent the time looking up words that really pertain to the time period, the stories and give you the essence of the time period."
2,Mediocre at best,"Definitely NOT one of my favorites! Boring in too many places to count and very long winded at times. After some of the reviews I was excited to read this one, but all I got was disappointment. Poor character development and an overall feeling of a deflated hot air balloon."
5,Teachers love these markers,I'm a teacher and I use these markers to create my anchor charts. The colors are really vivid and usually don't bleed through the paper. I like how the markers write so smoothly. I buy a new pack every year and they last me the whole school year.
2,It DOES bleed through,I typically love all Sharpie products. Purchased these for my preschool teachers to use on eco friendly paper. The markers bleed right through whether the paper is flat or on a chart stand. SO disappointed!! The colors are great - but doesn't do the job it promises.
3,Not What I Expected,Disappointed...I love Leslie Linsley's newspaper columns and thought there would be many great holiday decorating tips in the book. There were some ideas but far more 'history' than I expected.
2,Clip Breaks Faster than Expected,The velcro closing adds bulk and doesn't last long. The clip will break after couple months of daily use. On the upside it does protect the phone.
5,Great Album,I have found Andrina's album to be a well crafted and pleasuarble journey back to the time of great vocalists and wonderful music.
4,An often immitated story line.,"Boris is a quack prestidigitator whose premonitions suddenly begin to come true. One of the first of these kinds of stories possibly, but often immitated since. Reminicent of a One Step Beyond story. Worth a look though."
5,Perfect over the counter solution for quick anxiety relief,I can take two of these and it helps me stop thinking about the crazy day I just had and then just go to sleep. I can wake up normally without feeling groggy. Calms are also great for long plane trips where sleeping is difficult and especially for adjusting to time differences and having to try to fall asleep earlier than usual.
2,Sometimes wierd side effects,I took this one night and woke up with a hangover type headache. Product on a good day seems less useful than just mouth melt Melatonins.
4,Restful sleep; no morning dullness,"I use Calms Forte almost nightly. Get to sleep & stay that way thru-out night. Without some sort of sleep aid, I have trouble sleeping soundly. Cannot fall asleep easily & wake during the night not being able to fall back to sleep for any where from 3/4 to 1 1/2 hours. With Calms Forte I sleep well & unlike other sleep aids I wake up ready to go & not feeling ""drugged"" sluggish for a few after."
2,Great Game! Poorly made...,As an interactive DJ I am constantly in search of fun and easy games to entertain with at my events. This looked to be a pefect picnic/pool party game. The first time I used it the rings broke out of two of the holes! If you are going to make a game where you will be throwing things at it as part of the activity it needs to be made well. This was not what I would consider to be an inexpensive game either. The workmanship and overall quality of the game is poorly designed for the manner in which it is to be used. I now have to repair the game and make some modifications so that it can once again be useful to me. It is essentially a good game but it needed to be designed better.
3,The Dark Side of Tourism,"The book's main argument is that tourism transforms destinations into undifferentiated and unpoliticized spaces in which hordes of `barbarians' purchase and consume physical and emotional pleasure. For the authors, mass tourism brings valuable foreign exchange that can add to local income in peripherical countries, but there is a high price to be paid: the systematic destruction of the landscape and the corruption of the local culture."
1,Disappointed,I have always used Belkin products but these wireless notebook cards are a great disappointment. I ordered 2 of them just to be on the safe side and I have tried to load both of them into my laptop and neither of them will work. So I will be sending them back and checking out other wireless notebook cards.
1,Doesn't do what it's supposed to,"The installation was a snap. But when I was done, the adapter would connect to an existing N network at only the slower 54 Mbps Wireless G speed.There is some confusion as to what model I have as well. One sticker says N, one says N1. I tried the drivers for both, neither got me up to the speed my Linksys WUSB300N gets.I had wanted something smaller which fit the express slot, but this is not the one. I have received an RMA to return it.BTW, customer support is pathetic, they just didn't get it when I called"
2,"Has potential, but lousy customer service","I purchased two of these to go with my new Belkin N1 router. I installed the cards in my IBM and Compaq laptops. Installation and setup were very simple, kudos to Belkin for that. The IBM instantly connected and showed a speed of 300Mbps, the Compaq also connected, but only showed a speed of 54Mbps. No matter where I placed the two laptops the IBM always showed 300 and the Compaq showed 54. In addition, the Belkin Network Utility would only work on the IBM not on the Compaq. After several calls to Belkin support and two escallations to higher level techs (by the way, none of whom speak English as their primary language), I have given up and am returning all the Belkin products and going back to my Buffalo system until the ""N"" thing is figured out some more."
2,Doesn't seem to work to well,"Well, first off, I'm not sure if it's the card, or the N1 router itself, but ever since I installed the new N1 serious wireless in my home, I have had nothing but problems and poor connectivity. They clam that the N1 has extended range, I went back to my Pre N wireless and got twice the range and way better reliebility then with the N1. The concept seems good and the descriptions are great, but i can't say I feel the product is what they say it is."
1,"No ""Blue Screen""; Instead No Signal","I have Windows XP Home edition and I installed the wireless adapter software with no problems. However, after buying both the new Belkin N router and adapter at the same time, I was unable to connect the adapter to my wireless connection - the adapter wouldn't even recognize my connection. The few times it miraculously found the connection and connected the service would last seconds, at best.I called tech support and after spending 30 minutes on the phone, they were unable to help establish a connection and I eventually returned the adapter.However, as the other reviewers have mentioned, the Belkin N Router works perfectly - I have had no problems connecting it to my other, older wireless adapter."
1,Unsatisfied,This product is unstable. I have spent numerous hours on the phone with Belkin tech Support to no avail. One time they left me on the phone on hold for over three (3) hours. I need to pack these items up and mail them back or to Belkin.Gladwin Bailey
5,Highlights Beginning of A Style,"The authors bring to light the beginning of a style of singing made possible by the introduction of radio and the electric microphone. Separate from the shouting style of singing required by the acoustic horn phonograph and theatres with no amplification, the microphone allowed a more intimate soft style of singing. The book highlights the better known performers Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee as well as informs on the forgotten performers Art Gillham, Jack Smith, Little Jack Little and others instrumental in developing the intimate crooning style."
5,A impressive story of a loner in a high security prison.,"We have been to Alcatraz in July 1994. We have met Jim Quillen as an aged man, very sympatic. We where touched by his autobiography of the hard 10 years, doing time at Alcatraz. Visiting Alcatraz is impressive, even more when you know more about the background of some inmates. It gives you another perspective view on deliquents. It is good to see that corrections via imprisonment can achive creating a hard criminal into a nice person, father and grandfather."
5,Great programs,"Superb acting and writing. Most of today's TV programs are not worth watching once, As Time Goes By is enjoyable watching many times. Buy the entire series and enjoy,"
1,Blue eyes ...,=P This book is just one big sob story from cover to cover. I hate it. Its one of the worst books i have ever read.I would give it a 0 out of 100. Its a bunch of ....Its all about a little shezzling who loses her brother big woop-dee-doo-da-day.=P
2,Beautiful Bible but Binding problems,"This is a very beautiful bible. I love the Life Application version. However, the first one I received got a bad crease where the two leathers meet in the front. I thougth it was just a problem with that one. Maybe they had missed stitching it. Amazon was great about sending me a replacement. However, it looks like the same thing is happening with this one. So while it is pretty, it doesn't look like it will hold up."
1,"Costs more, but the quality was less","Bought this one and the TuTone Black made by the same company. I figured since this one was more expensive, then it would have a higher quality. Boy was I wrong. The other, cheaper (by about $20) one had better binding material, and overall just felt better in my hand. I was very, very disappointed in this bible. In fact, the pages within were of a poor quality, even though both bibles should have the exact same material of paper on the inside. I sent this one back and kept the TuTone Black... Still love it!"
4,Illustrated?,I almost bought this. I want to look inside to see what I am paying almost thirty extra dollars for. I passed up the purchase beause I could not see inside.
4,The NIV-LASB is great BUT get the one with thumb tabs - see the link in this review ...,"The NIV Life Application Study Bible is great BUT I've definitely appreciated upgrading to get the BEST one, which is the exact same on the inside as this product but has a genuine leather cover (rather than bonded leather) AND indexed thumb tabs to make finding the books of the Bible easier. This 'best' one is available here on Amazon for just a few dollars more -- find it, and my full review, at:NIV Life Application Study Bible (New International Version)."
1,Easy for new reader,For new readers who wish to enjoy and understand the bible better this is just the right one to buy. Its very simple and has day to day practical examples which talks to you about life today. Well explained and I just cannot put it down whenever I pick it up.
5,Amazing Bible,This is an amazing Bible. I have wanted a Life Application Bible for years and this is the perfect one. The leather is absolutely phenomenal. This will be one for a life time!
5,beautiful soft leather bible,"I bought this bible as a graduation gift for my nephew who graduated from West Point Military Academy. The life application bible is terrific! It explains the text in a way that you can understand and apply to your life. I have a life application study bible but not one with such a beautiful leather binding as this one. The leather was soft, supple, and luxurious. My husband liked it so much he told me he would like me to buy him one as well. I highly recommend this beautiful bible."
2,Great book - just don't read the last 3 pages!,"I almost gave this book a rating of 9 however the absolute stupidity of the last few pages dropped my liking of this book 5 whole points!The book is another great piece of work by P&N but they ran out of steam and just wrapped it up. I suggest reading the end of this ""Alien Invasion - So humanity must save the eath"" book alone, As I was unhappy that there were people around when I flung the book clear across the room. There was no need for me to scare people like that over a REALLY bad ending."
2,"This is a very shallow book, seems like written in a hurry","Can't say it is a good book, when it isn't. Lucifer's Hammer was MUCH BETTER, like if written by some other author. This one is pushing slowly, nothing really happens, you know it all ahead, only perhaps the end is a little fun, but it is not unexpected. It is all so very unfinished, a lot of stuff happens, but is left open, perhaps they tried to do too much in too little space. It could be twice as long but who the hell would read it then. With one word: BORING !"
5,Speculative Goodness,"I have not completely read this novel yet, but so far it is excellent, and it arrived in the condition that I expected and in a timely manner."
3,Blast From the Past,"They don't write `em like this anymore! Admittedly, some would say with good reason.... but it brought back memories of all the fat paperbacks I sat up nights reading in the 80s. Cold War... teletypes... cassette tapes... Betamax machines... the Space Shuttle Challenger plays a key role in the final battle scene. I thought this book was a real hoot, likeThe War of the Worldswritten by Tom Clancy. (My copy had a blurb from Clancy on the cover!)OK, OK, it *is* almost impossible to keep track of the hundreds of characters (there is a list inside the front of the book - always a sure sign of trouble)... there are plot holes you could drive a truck through... the aliens, well, to be honest most of the characters are not particularly believable, ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN!.... the science is somewhat laughable nowadays... and the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying."
2,"Not the worst book I ever read, but in the top 20.","While it wasn't a TOTAL waste, overall this book was pretty awful. I concur with previous critical reviewers that it had...*An absolutely horrid ending - I too thought my copy must be missing at least 10 to 20 pages.*Far too many characters - Many of whose appearance is inexplicable and who have absolutely no bearing on the plot (whatever the plot is).*An annoying amount of Alien 'babble' which left me scratching my head - Look, I want to read a book, not learn a new non-existent language.*Too much ambiguity regarding background details.*Extremely slow pacing through much of the book....Unfortunately, I bought this along with 'The Mote In God's Eye'. I am hoping that one is far better."
2,Read it becuase of other people's 5-star ratings here!BOOH!,Good Stuff1. Aliens are unique2. Nulear wars3. Cataclysmic weaponsBad1. Thin Plot2. Too many characters3. Very Very Slow beginning and middle4. Story gets better around page 4005. Bad ending
4,"Great Book, Why Never a Movie?","I read this book years ago. The story is great and still interesting and believable.My only complaint is that to me some of the imagery is anti-republican(Maybe just me???), but don't let that get in your way of enjoying this."
5,Footfall,"Larry Niven is one of my favorite Authors. This is a very riveting book. Hard to put down. I believe if we had malignant aliens land here in such a way, We would do as much the same as the heros in this book."
2,"Good mindless fun story, but Heroes were irritating","If you just want to read a pretty good story, then read this. The book made me stop reading Niven & Pournelle collaborations for a while though. I found the Heroic SF Writers to be way to irritating. They knew everything, more than scientists and more than the military. Basically, they knew more about anything than anyone else. There instant knowledge of all things, and their seeming ability to read each others thoughts made the protagonists too unbelievable. I thought it was very self indulgent. I liked the premise though and everything else was good. I just wished that they could have kept the gratuitous SF Writers as Omniscient Beings theme down."
2,I will never look at elephants the same again,"Another story line with so much potential that simply fell flat. An invasion of earth conjures up War of the Worlds or Independence Day but not ""Mars Attacks"". Making the aliens resemble elephants does not add to the story. The way in which the aliens would try to force a person into subservience, foot on chest, seemed far fetched. The space battle towards the end of the book was okay but I was left wondering how we could have developed the technology so quickly. I guess invading elephants on Para gliders will motivate you to create almost anything and quickly. The ending was anti climatic and silly but that actually fits in perfect with the overall theme of the book. Lucifer's Hammer by these two authors was an excellent read I totally enjoyed. Sadly FootFall is no Lucifer's Hammer"
2,ultimately a let down,"I love the 'alien invasion' genre. I read this book waiting for all the threads and story-lines to wrap up in a nice satisfying package. I was dissapointed. As other reviewers have said, there are a lot of extraneous characters. And how the hell does Harry Red get himself insterted throughout the entire storyline? The book could have been reduced by 20 to 30% by eliminating some of the unneccessary characters and sub-plots.And then you have the elephantine aliens. The book I had included a page of art depicting the aliens. They weren't elephant-like, they were elephants! I was waiting for some point in the story for the reason or 'link' between the aliens and earth elephants. Why were they so similar in appearance? What was their link? How are they related? I waited patiently for this part of the plot to evolve. It never did. We never find out. You cannot explain this by parallel evolution, but the authors never bother to explain their relationship.And the ending just sucked!"
1,"NOT, Lucifer's Hammer","I tried to like it, but it just did not do it for me. I read it after enjoying Lucifer's Hammer. I was hoping for the same quality, but it was not any where close.Most of the reviews cover my feelings. The biggest problem I had was the body type of the Invaders. The people that read it know what I am saying.It's best to stay away from this one. I really feel bad saying that after loving Lucifer's Hammer, but it is what it is!"
2,airport reading..maybe..,"Well, I have to agree with many of the critiques about the use (or misuse) of the cast of characters. Overall I really wasnt very impressed. One amusing bit is that the book is also a not so subtle anti-liberal screed. Characters mutter about the liberals every 50 pages or so and then of the two characters described as liberal: One ends badly (cowardice apparently) and the last we see of the other he's lamenting his opposition to industry and nuclear power as that might have saved everyone from the aliens (midway through, not giving anything away here).I was curious about the right-wing slant so I did some googling and found that Jerry Pournelle is apparently well known for this kind of material. Liberals and eco-terrorists figure prominently as villains in his work. Its just an amusing, if slightly nutty, undercurrent. My real problems with the book were the jumble of characters and the somewhat abrupt ending."
1,Self-serving silliness,"A book in which Science Fiction writers save the world. Somehow, they know more about military technology than the military. Yeah, right. Every single thing the writers thought of turned out to be true and nobody but the writers understood what's going on. What an unbelievably self-important and self-indulgent premise for a book. Authors should make some effort to stay out of their own fiction unless they promise to maintain their objectivity. Well written, but deeply dissatisfying."
4,Story was intersting but ending was lacking.,"I though the story would be another version of Independence Day, but I was wrong. The story telling was very engrossing. The authors should have added at least another chapter. Can we say denouement?"
4,War of the Worlds Meets Dumbo! (NOT!),"If someone were to describe this book to you in just a few words, you might think it absurd. The ""Snouts"" invade earth? But don't be fooled for a minute! The Niven/Pournelle team is famous for imaginative insights into the alien perspective and fabulous character development. This novel could have been about giant slugs invading earth and you'd be interested in learning what they were thinking and what the human characters were going to do about it. Niven/Pournelle do what Stephen King does so well, - create characters that reflect so many aspects of human nature, and plunges them into a crisis so that we can watch regular guys and gals become heroes. Interesting, inspiring, and different."
2,IT FELL A LITTLE FLAT,"Footfall is another ambitious attempt by the team of Niven and Pournelle. The formula, previously used in Lucifer's Hammer, is an apocalyptic event with a huge cast of characters drawn on a relatively limited canvas. While Lucifer's Hammer mostly succeeded, Footfall mostly fails. While I admire the conceptions of this novel, the execution left too much to be desired. Only a handful of the dozens of characters are even somewhat compelling. The invaders mindset is brilliant, but the communication of the aliens motivations and goals is tedious and difficult to understand. Harry Red is fun up to a point but he turns into Uncle Joe from Petticoat Junction showing up in the cast of Alien. Everything in this book is either too much or not enough. Too many characters, not enough information revealed. Too much action, not enough payoff. There were several chapters where I just felt lost.In fact, after a while, I just didn't give a Fithp!"
3,Good but not their best work,"Footfall is a good read but it is not Niven and Pournelle at their best.Don't get me wrong. Footfall is a page turner but given the authors' reputations, I was expecting more.The aliens were interesting. I've never seen the idea of evolved pack animals expanded upon but it makes sense. Understanding their psychology was as important as weapons used.I give Footfall a solid C+. It moves fast and there's plenty of action and suspense.If you like it, try out ""Ringworld"" and ""the Man Kzinti Wars"" by the same authors."
4,SPOILER!!,"Ok, it's dated, blahblah, but it's a good solid hard sf story, along the lines of Hogan.....and it has the best description of design, construction, and flight of an Orion drive ship that I've ever seen. Worth it for that alone"
4,"Unique, A True Original Classic","FootfallWhat the writers took away from the human characters, they poured into their aliens. Cruel, dignified, clueless and cunning, utterly communal creatures changing from their exposure to the human race. I have to admit that I cringed when the aliens first make their appearance -- basically elephants using low-tech bullet rifles. But they end up becoming the best part of the book, their final decision attesting to their dignified commitment to the ""herd.""I'm not a sci-fi regular, and you don't need to be one either to be moved by this outstanding study of a truly alien society."
3,"It's okay, but.....","Footfall is an ambitious novel that succeeds in some areas but falls flat in as many others. There are probably 7 or 8 character threads, and 3 of them are interesting. By halfway through the book you learn which characters are worth reading about and which you can safely skim over. There's nothing wrong with the story, but I kept finding myself putting it down and picking up something else to read.One conceit of Niven and Pournelle I found amusing was the importance of Science Fiction writers. Something's gone wrong? Ask the sci fi writers. President needs advice? Ask the sci fi writers. It doesn't hurt the story, but it did make me smile at the prominence of writers as portrayed in the book."
2,"if you get past the middle, you might like it","However, the challenge is to get that far. Yes, the beginning is very BORING and very hard to read - the plot jumps between 10 different characters every 2-3 pages! As a literary work, this book is a disappoitment. However, most of the SCI-FI aspect is decent (except the part where the sci-fi writers are made top advisors to the government). I wouldn't recomment it, instead read the Ringworld series, it's much better."
2,It's not quite how I remembered it,"I read this book as a teenager and thought it was pretty cool. 20 years have passed and I thought I'd give it another read. And I have to say, that I really didn't like it all that much. The book doesn't really seem to be focused on an event or a character. Instead the author introduces a slew of characters that you neither care about nor are they really tracked through the story. And the few characters that recur enough to remember them, are really cardboard constructs rather than something you'd relate to.As far as the main plot goes, it got off to a very slow start. It tries to pick up a little bit in the middle and will leave you with a half-finished feeling. I'm a fan of the aliens invading earth premise but this was just a disappointment. Either that or it's been done better in the last 20 years."
4,Baby elephants?!!?,"Someone asked me on the Metro the other day what I was reading and what the story was about. I replied ""Imagine Independence Day on steroids"". This a fun book!! I've read a couple of reviews that indicated the readers thought the begining is too slow. Maybe so, what with all of the characters and different plot lines that only come together as the book progresses, but it is well worth getting past the first couple of chapters. This is a very imaginitive book, having lots of background on the aliens and explaining their strengths and weaknesses. The book reminds me of several of Tom Clancy's novels, especially Red Storm Rising. My only complaints with the book are 1) its too short (although I have no complaint with the ending) and 2) like the Clancy novels, too many of the characters are somehow related to one another or know one another when it really isn't that small of a world! This is a book that is well worth the purchase price."
3,A decent adventure story ...,"... but I liked the Legacy of Herot better. This is a good, solid adventure story but it doesn't get going until almost halfway through the (very long) book. The first half introduces a *lot* of characters and most of them don't get fleshed out very well and don't seem to serve much purpose other than filling space. As usual, the detail that they put into providing a choherent background for how and why the aliens act as they do is fasinating. This has always been the strong point for this writing team. All in all it is a fairly good read but not something that I will ever pick up again."
4,"A good book,.. not a great one.","I just finished reading this book, it was my second Niven novel to read so far. After skimming through the reviews of the book, especally the negitive ones I felt like writing my own review. First off, yes, the book does have it's quirks for a Sci-Fi novel - Such as the Scifi writers working as presidential advisors who spent most of book admiring the effectivness of the alien invasion and also having the earth invaded by ""commie elephants"" (snicker..). However, the book was still a excellent read and I felt the ending was more than worth waiting for. Without giving away anything, I felt it showed that tide of a battle can turn in any given moment and you can end up with a slightly unpexected result."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had never heard of Bamboo Cutting Boards and was impressed by the pictures and advertisements posted on Amazon.com. In addition, in person the wood grain and various interlaying colors of this item are truly beautiful. However, I was very disappointed in the quality of the craftsmanship. Some of the various seams between the wooden pieces in the cutting board had large open gaps while others exposed wood glue that had leaked out and dried. It also appeared as though during manufacturing some gaps in the wood were filled with glue or sealant, creating an unsightly blemish on the item. Even more noticeable were 1/2-inch areas located in various spots around both sides of the cutting block that appeared to be rough or un-sanded/unfinished exposed wood. I do not recommend purchasing this item through the internet."
2,Video,"Not what I wanted, but it does have some helpful drills. It seems to focus on the same part of the foot drills just going in different directions."
2,Product itself is probably fine,Product was a rewrap and the batteries were installed/shipped in the product so that they arrived dead. Had to go out and buy new batteries but now I don't know if there was something wrong with the product or not. Supposed to get 300 hours out of the batteries will have wait and see.
5,Best Acoustic Pickup,"Awesome. One of the best pickups you can find on the market and at a great price. If I had to do it over again, I would still purchase the Fishman Rare Earth."
1,kitchen design for dummies,"I'm an interior designer trying to get ideas for my first kitchen renovation project. This book was extremely basic-- took me an hour to read and I didn't see any lasting merit. Some of the designs pictured are not in the best of taste either. This book is for first time home-buyers wondering whether or not to take on a kitchen renovation. It's the kind of book that should begin, ""What is a kitchen?"""
2,Kitchen Designs Boring,"Kitchen design is really technical and overwelmhing for me so I need someone to do the explaining in person.It has some OK information and kitchen designs but with three uninspiring kitchen books, I've decided, kitchen books are not my thing.I enjoy the Interior Design books much more."
2,Very Basic,"We are working on our 2nd kitchen remodel and found this book just too basic which means it might be right as a basic book for a first timer. Just a few kitchens were used to illustrate principles and I would have liked to see a larger portfolio represented. ""Great Kitchens, At Home with America's Top Chefs"" had the ideas that I was looking for."
3,Chamber Jazz History Lesson,"I didn't care for this disc but I'm not panning it altogether because the playing is first rate and the ideas are innovative and ahead of their time. I just don't care for the music - it's more a matter of personal taste. These 18 tracks, recorded in 1946 by the Dave Brubeck Octet, feature a good deal of experimental (for the period) ""chamber jazz"" based on some standards as well as original compositions. On one track, an announcer actually narrates as the group goes through a series of variations on How High The Moon, from early jazz form to bop. Interesting stuff, intellectually stimulating but not very fun to listen to. I'm just a traditionalist...it's gotta swing! Recommended for serious students of jazz and history buffs only. If you're looking for some swinging jazz octet, check out Dave Pell or Don Fagerquist."
2,Very Pre-Quartet,"Too many instruments, too many notes. Dave's famous groove has not developed in the octet but, hey, this was 60+ years ago and it sounds like it."
4,terrific music from a first rate orchestra,"I was lucky enough to have listen to the CPE Bach kammerorchester in the Concerthall of amsterdam on the 12th of july 1999, and this made such a deep impression that since then I have become a great admirer of Hartmut Haenchen and his ""team"". They most absolutely bring this music alive. And seldom have I enjoyed classical music as much as then, so I can certainly recommend it to everyone."
2,David Cross is usually funnier.,"David Cross, star of stage and screen, is normally hilarious. And with a title like that, I was sure that 'Munging' was some hilarious indie slang for something disturbing. Alas, page after page I turned hoping for a witty anecdote, but none came. I never even figured out who the main character 'Perl' was supposed to be. Was she some sort of computer / robot? Why does everyone want to Mung her? Sloppy writing David, you really phoned it in here. Stick to Arrested Development."
4,class assignment,"Joanie and Teddy have a cat, a dog, and a parrot. The house is just the right size for all of them. One day, they bring a baby home. The pets are confused at what type of pet this is. They finally figure out it is a baby, but they still feel left out. They try anything to get attention. Read this and find out what finally gets it.I reall enjoyed this book. When my younger siblings were born, I felt left out and just wanted attention. This book made me feel like I could relate to the animals. If your child is feeling left out, I would suggest this book."
5,Great stuff!,This DVD is a best-of all of Peach DVD's Ultra Vixens series and the scenes are smoking hot. The girls are absolutely gorgeous.
1,Management Information Systems,"I would like to know if there are any books that beside this book so that I can review about how to prepare for job interview. In particularly, for major in ""Management Information Systems."" That's right, so I can learn and understand more about the topic and get well prepared for job interview in computer field.I am wondering if this is possible, I'd like to have this book for review ASAP.Thank you very much for your time and help. I really appreciate if you can return mine message ASAP when you found a kind of the book that I am looking for as above message.Sincerely Your,Joseph Nguyen"
4,Their Last CD,"I really enjoyed this cd by the Winans Brothers. I really loved Count it all Joy and I Need You, this album is a must own. God bless the Winans family."
2,Christian quiet storm...,"My, how time tends to take the edge off. I gave this LP 2 stars because I expected some of the music to have energy and enthusiasm. Boy, was I wrong. This record ventures down the 'quiet storm' corridor without turning left or right, and without going up or down. Fans of smooth jazz will dig this, fans of the early Winans records may not. From 'Paradise' to 'Prone to Wander' the mood rarely peaks above mellow. Their remake of 'The Question Is', for lack of a nicer word, is just plain disappointing. Maybe the Winans were simply and reluctantly trying to fulfill a contractual obligation to their record company. Time definitely has brought about a change...and then its gone away(Finders Keepers)."
3,Gun case,"Good enough for running back and forth to the range. Solid materials used but case is nit much of a hybrid! It's mostly a soft case in spite of thin plastic qualifying it as a hybrid. Inside foam could be thicker to minimize gun movement too. OK product, but would not rush my friends out to purchase their own."
3,OK but ..,"Well I expected a bit more. Don't judge the DVD by its cover because you won't see youth national team players. During the drills we can hear the baseball team nearby practising. We can't hear the players asking questions to the coach. At one point we can hear the coach shouting ""How many tape have you left?"".Although the drills are interesting but could have added more and cut some game simulation drills. It's not a bad DVD but it's not worth the price."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Not really what I had expected for the money. I have to agree with the other reviewer about the production being interrupted by distracting sound, wind etc... The video quality was spotty at best and I notised frames where it appears that the digital picture is pixelating into dark colors in multiple segments of this DVD.There appears to be some good coaching going on but I do not think this DVD really gets that point across as the production seems to be totally adlib with little thought to planning a thoughtful learning lesson. It is more like watching a local high school team practice and less of a finished product than I would care to purchase."
4,Not as advertised,"This particular item is not a smoke detector model, but rather is a motion detector look-a-like. Equally as descrete, but not as advertised. The picture does not match the product delivered."
2,Abnormal psych and it's roots,This is about 3 young people and how the forces that surround them mold them into the warped personalities they become. The ensuing crimes they commit flow from their fractures psyches. To me this read almost like an abnormal psych textbook.
3,The twisted ones,Not a bad read at all just expected the ending to have more to it. Overall I enjoyed the book.
3,Great effort,"This book is short, the story is simple, and the characters are predictable... but it is a ""fun"" read. Can't beat the price (at the time I purchased it anyway) and you can't expect too much from a free book."
1,twisted ones,this is an interesting story.everyone can learn something from this book.the firdt time i went yo montauk i knew i have end up writing about it.
3,Ummmm....,"Well, not much of a page turner, this one. It certainly isn't a bad book, it's well written and slightly interesting. It just doesn't really go any where. There's no climax, no real denouement, it just sort of....is. And it certainly isn't ""revealing"" into the ""psyche"" of youth.Strange. That's the feeling I'm left with. Just, strange."
4,The not so innocent fifties,"Those of us who had our childhood in the fifties know that it was really no Leave It To Beaver life. The small town life in this small book conceals so much festering dysfunction; what's really sad here is that in each case of these psycho kids, there is so much mis-understanding. Each character has a persona perceived by others, but inside, they are totally something else. (But isn't that the way it is with all of us?) It took me a few pages to get my bearings in this book; I believe it's a vintage one from the 1950's, and the writing style reflects this. Once I got into the story, I had to keep reading to find out the connection between the characters. My conclusions: Life is all happenstance."
5,Nice paper,"I prefer using unbleached paper, and this one works nicely. The box has a good cutter, which makes it more convenient"
3,Good but...,"These are lovely pens. The color is very bright and writing is very smooth. I use them to write notes and highlight the study material. They are not like regular highlight marker, they feel very delicate and appealing. I would give it 5-star if the caps are not cracking. It's been over 4 month now. Most pens still have plenty of ink, and will last at least a couple of month. However, 5 of 8 the caps are broken and the pens are dying fast. I would hope Paper Mate can use different material to prevent cracking of the caps."
3,Flair pens?,These are not at all the Flair pens I have had in the past. I am very disappointed in them. I would call them fine point and I would not call them Flair pens.
5,Flair pens,These were shipped SUPER FAST and were perfect! I still can't find these in most stores. Will probably get another set!
3,Liquid Flair Pens,"Nice! Like the design, but if you apply lots of pressure when you write, these aren't the pens for you because the tips get ruined :("
3,Short on Ink,"I really like the way the pens write and I like the vivid colors, but the ink ran out extremely fast. The pens are greatly over priced for the amount of use they provide."
4,almost perfect,"I thought the product was great. The pens worked very well and have a stylish casing. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes felt tip pens. My only problem was that the seal on the package seemed to have been broken when the package arrived to me. However, the product was fully intact and has been working marvelously."
1,Dissappointed,"I was expecting more from this cd. It is all keyboard piano sound and not very good sound at that. If one wanted to make music based on the piano, why would anyone bother with a pathetic keyboard. I suppose if one knows nothing of music this might be fairly interesting. I was more annoyed than relaxed when listening to the cd. I was hoping to find something soothing that I could listen to when I go into labor. I am glad I heard it before that time comes. I may have taken it and thrown it accross the room!"
5,great,"My son loves the game, I am not familiar with video games, but he is happy so thats all that matters."
2,Okay game but BAD graphics,"Honestly, I haven't gotten very far in the game. The graphics are very disappointing though. I bought this game off of Ebay for $16 and I'm glad I didn't buy it new at the store for $50. Basically, the game is a glorified gameboy game. The graphics are EXACTLY the same. The story line is also a little hard to follow because of this. You go from level to level doing something different. It kind of reminds me of a Yoshi game for Gameboy. If you were considering buying this game new DON'T. I would buy it used for under $25 off of Ebay or at EB Games or another used game store."
4,Great Game,"I was very excited to add this in my collection. The game came in a video store rental case, no cover, but it's okay, because I was able to print one up. Everything arrived just fine and in a timely manner.Thanks."
4,Video game madness,"This game is very fun. Some tough puzzles were offered. Bosses were beaten. Overall, just a great game."
5,"Great Fun, Loved it","This game is not like Wind-Waker at all. It is more like the Legend of Zelda for the NES, which I thought was great. The graphics are not super great, but if you love playing Zelda on the NES you will love this game. We didn't play with the Game Boy Advance, but just played the one player game. It's very addicting and fun for everyone. Don't bother with the book, go online to find out clues for some of the more complicated puzzles.Don't pass this one up, especially now that it's on sale."
5,A Very Rich and Vibrant score !!!,"I've always been interested in this Opera/Oratorio and finally purchased it. Firstly, I'm a great lover of Jessye Norman and I'm automatically drawn towards anything she's recorded. I didn't realize that Bryn Terfel was on the cast, so that was a plus for me, GREAT VOICE.Mr Ozawa is great with the ochestra and like most reviewers, the chorus is simply GORGEOUS. One of the most richest sounds a corp of male voices has ever created.I love this rare work and look forward to discovering the world of Stravinsky."
2,not what they seem,"I bought these for my in-laws for x-mas. They love them. I personally didn't like them. The picture of them is not what I got. I recieved the egg rings with the fold down handles. Not what I wanted. As you can see the picture is of rings with solid stand-up handles, the ones I thought I was ordering. The fold down ones are harder to clean. I researched to find the right ones, and I didn't get them."
2,So so product,When the product came in I couldn't move the handle on one of them luckily I thought to spray some cooking oil on it and then the handle open and closed great. However when I went to use the product I noticed the eggs run under it I had to hold the spatula on top of it with some force so it wouldn't run as much. Overall the product is ok but not great would def just buy it at the store and save myself the shipping and handling cost.
4,Good Product,Works well when sprayed with cooking oil. Is heavy enough to keep the egg inside the ring if the skillet bottom if really flat and not scared. Nice size for English muffin sandwiches. Also good for making round hash brown patties. I gave this a 4 because I don't think any of these are perfect. I've tried several different kinds and these are the best.
1,Heard It Once... Don't Need To Hear It Again,"I was highly disappointed in Ben Bledsoe's debut CD. Not to mention the lengthy cd title, it was also a very dull cd. None of the songs were really worth listening to twice. It seems Mr. Bledsoe has steered too far from his popbeginnings and has let fame go to his head... You can't get far with just good looks."
2,So so DVD,This is not the best PELE DVD you will find. I recommend the latest with all his goals: PELE ETERNO.
3,Soccer - Pele- the Master & His Method,"I did not realize that I had seen this DVD on film around 1971 when Pepsi Cola used to loan it out. It is still interesting for youth to see,"
2,a confusing book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read, thankfully it is very short. The author keeps making referrences to chapters and ideas that have not yet even been discussed, so basically you have to read the book twice before anything even begins to make sense. The british spellings of several words (centre instead of center) gets rather annoying, unless you happen to be British."
1,Piece of Junk,Worst piece of junk I've ever bought. The inflatable piece wouldn't blow up like it was supposed to and the legs were very wobaly. Returned it immediately.
1,Not for newborns,"We bought this tub for grandma's house and were really disappointed with it. The plus is that it folds up nicely. However, the legs kept folding under when moved after each use and needed to be fixed before using it again. Our son is 4 months old and kept sliding down the tub. I would not recommend this for a young baby, as it took two people to give a bath - one person to hold the baby in place, the other to do the bathing. I felt as though my baby was unsafe in this tub."
3,Good for travel,It is good for travel but not on a daily basis. My baby slides on it.It is not balanced. Too deep.
1,This tub blows.,"I must say, this was-without a doubt- the biggest waste of money. We haven't been able to inflate the tub, and it's not for lack of trying. The legs are not sturdy, our baby slides around in this tub, and it does not exactly fold easily to compact dimensions. If you're cramped for space and live say, in a box, then this tub is for you. If you have enough room to walk around in your bathroom, then just invest in a regular tub and save yourself the backache of trying to figure out where to stow this widget."
1,Don't buy this tub!,"Why you shouldn't buy this tub:1. The legs on this tub supposedly fold out and lock into place. But they don't lock well, so there's a chance the tub can collapse with your baby in it.2. The area where the baby lays is supposedly inflatable (with multiple nozzles you have to blow into to inflate it). But you have to pinch the nozzle so tightly to get air into it, it's almost impossible to inflate.3. Even if you get past the chance of it collapsing and the fact that you have to re-inflate it every time you want to use it, the tub doesn't fold away easily.Don't buy this tub."
1,Worst Baby Tub Ever,"This bath tub is the absolute worst. It is hard to fold, unfold, blow up, and bathe a child in! What is it good for? Nothing! My baby slid all over the place in the tub. The ""incline"" for the seat is not an incline at all. It's almost the same as laying it down fully. I would not reccommend this product to anyone. I am returning it immediatly."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TUB,I bought this thinking that it would be helpful since we don't have much room in our bathroom. My daughter slides all around in it and it is very dangerous. The legs are wobbly and dangerous. The valve that is made to drain the water leaks constantly. This is the worst baby tub I have ever seen or used!
1,Not for newborns,I was looking for something that I could use from newborn to toddler and only found disappointment. The legs do not lock into place and a newborn (or any child) can accidentally knock the drain plug out with ease. Perhaps the legs will stay in place when you fill the basin up for a toddler or small child. Definitely not for everyday use. Considering recycling into something better rather than donating it.
2,Okay when they are little,"I received this bath as a gift and was excited. However there are a few problems with it that would make me not want to purchase it. 1st, it is very slick and he is constantly sliding down the inclined side of the tub. Which just means you have to hold him the whole time, which can be very awkward because of where the sides are. 2nd, as he has gotten bigger (almost 4 months) he is too long for the tub (about 24 inches) he can no longer splash around and looks very uncomfortable. I would imagine when he masters sitting the tub will work okay again, but by then we can just use the big tub. It will help when traveling though. So to conclude it works, but I think there are better buys out there."
4,good tub,"good fold away bath tub. easy to store in homes with limited space. baby is now 6 months old and still using this tub and loves it! inflatable plastic makes it very cushy for baby. some others complained that it is of poor quality and very unstable. i did not find this to be true at all. my baby can be very wiggly and is not at all a small baby by an means, and i feel that he is perfectly safe in tub.he does tend to slide while lying on his back. i simply out a hand towel underneath him and it keeps him in place."
1,Not stable - not recommended,"Both my daughter and I have tried to use this a couple of times to bathe her newborn. We are both uncomfortable with the instability of it. The legs do not lock in well and I feel like it's going to collapse under the baby. If baby would be perfectly still and I would not bump the sides at all, it would probably work - so it's useless. I am going to return it."
1,Not safe,"I bought this to use with my 2 month old. I tried it the first night with one side inclined but he was slipping around in it. The second night I tried it with both sides inclined, thinking maybe this would help him to stay in place, but no such luck. Not only would he slip down into the water as there is little to no support, it also tends to push him off to the side. I'll be returning this today. I have to say that I am rather disappointed."
1,Traumatizing for baby,We tried this tub once and immediately returned it. The foldaway idea is great but the product itself was terrible.- the legs don't easily snap in and out of place.- the inflatable inside would not stay level. It tilted to one side and tried to dump my baby on his face.- the plastic is cold. We poured hot water over it to warm it up but it immediately cooled down again. It was a huge shock against the baby's skin and resulted in a shrieking baby.The whole experience was a nightmare and I would not recommend this to anybody.
1,Very unsafe tub for a newborn,"I do not recommend this product for a newborn. It is unsafe, as it is too large and slippery for a newborn. If you are not holding your infant with both hands, they will slip around in the tub too much, and potentially have their head slip into the water in the water in the tub. There is no way you could safely bathe a newborn without two people on the job using this bathtub. If you're looking for a bathtub that you can easily and safely use for newborns, I recommend one with an infant sling. The sling cradles the baby and prevents them from slipping, keeping one or both of your hands free for washing the baby. This product will be returned, and I highly caution any parents against purchasing this product, given the safety issues."
1,Unsafe product,This bath was very unsafe for my newborn. It is very difficult to wash them in this tub. You almost have to hold them with 2 hands which makes it difficult to wash them. I liked the idea that you could fold it away when you were done but it was too difficult to fold so I didn't do it. There are two clips at each end in the center of the tub and it made the are where the baby lays uneven and if you don't hold them they can roll to the side. There is no support like in other tubs I have seen to keep them from slipping down either. I plan on returning this item.
1,Horrible,After one use a seam broke on the liner creating a large imbalance. The plug also easily pops out spilling water.
3,"Beautiful artwork, beautiful reproductions","I thought the artwork in this book was stunning, and the reproduction quality and colors were lovely. I did have one major problem with the book, two of the main designs on the cover (topmost horizontal design and the center horizontal design) are NOT IN THE BOOK! These are two of the main patterns I planned to use from the book, and now if I want to, I need to get them from the cover, where they are covered by text. I found this to be unacceptable! Please keep this fact in mind if the cover is what won you over."
5,Good designs,"If you are into art nouveau, you will enjoy this Dover book. Again many variations on floral themes."
5,The Excitement never Ends!,"I loved how this book all started and I couldn't put it down! Ben and Jillian really get to know each other under the harshest of circumstances. Ben, being a ruffian, usually doesn't see anything special in prim and proper types, but he can't seem to help the pull that Jillian has at him. Great book to curl up to and get pulled away to a different land."
3,Annoying Hero,"What finally did it for me with this book was the annoying hero. Every time he called Jillian ""sweetcakes"" I just wanted to punch him. I put it down when he was towelling himself off and asininely asks her, ""Want to dry my back?"" Yeah, with sandpaper!I also thought the descriptive scenes were lacking. It just sounded like Howard read one (1) encyclopedia, and did no research to enliven or spice anything up with further detail. Another thing -- why didn't Ben just tell Kates ""No, Dutra can't come with us""? Once he found out what a sleaze Kates planned on bringing, I don't see why he couldn't have done that.I didn't find the purse scene humorous at all. I couldn't understand why she was assaulting her own guide, the guy she was paying money for. Maybe it just sounded like a cute idea on paper.But now I see all these other glowing positive reviews! so maybe I will give it a second chance. The heroine is admirable and her motivation is sound and believable."
3,A Bit Iffy On This One!,"I just don't feel that this was one of Linda Howard's best works. It was a bit too predictable for me. Dutra was described as what one would perceive a villain to be described, especially with his spiky teeth. Rick, Jillian's brother was also a predictable character. He acted too much like a spoiled brat and obviously jillian didn't feel too bad about his death because she slept with Ben right on the same day that he died. Also, if Kates was such a shady character why didn't Jillian question him in the beginning regarding his reasons for funding the search. I just found myself questioning too many things with this book. I hope her other books are better."
2,Average at Best,"One of Howards earlier books ('97) this is not in the same league as her more current titles such as Now You See Her ('99).I thought both the story-line and the characters where weak, the only thing compensating the story where the infrequent references to the myths of the Amazon.This book will be heading to the second-hand store."
5,One of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors,"Full of humor, adventure, and sizzling passion, ""Heart of Fire"" is one of Linda Howard's best (and that's saying a lot!). Gillian Sherwood is an archeologist on a quest for a legendary red diamond and proof of the Amazons' exsistence. Ben Lewis is a ruffian, scoundral, and the best river guide in Brazil. When they team up to lead an expedition deep into the heart of the Amazon's rainforest, they must face the perils of the jungle, out-manuver murderous thugs, and then find their way back to civilization again.Wonderful characters, snappy dialogue, exotic locations, this book has it all. This is a multi-read, pass-along book, a definite keeper. Enjoy.Nina M."
5,Suspense in the Amazon,"Linda Howard hits another homerun with her Heart of Fire. The plot is suspenseful,adventurous, and intriquing as her characters search for the lost Stone City in the Amazon. Linda Howard develops her characters so fully that you understand and know their motives and personalities. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys adventure and suspense topped with romantic interludes."
4,Great Book,"I am new to Linda Howard's books, and I loved this one. Lot's of details without being flooded with useless information. Descriptive, you can almost feel the heat. They only thing I could say that needed improvement would be the love scenes. I was very anti-climatic (excuse the pun). She built the anticipation up between the two main characters but the when it came to the act, it was bland and boring. But I would definitely buy another book from Linda Howard."
5,Heart of Fire,"This Linda Howard book was the best of the best. If you don't read another book this year, read this one. Great adventure and riveting romance."
5,One of Linda's Best!!!,"Archeologist Jillian Sherwood believed the lost Amazon city, once inhabited by women warriors and containing a rare red diamond, did exist and she was determined to find it. Hiring Ben Lewis, number one river guide in Brazil, was a necessity she was willing to put up with since Ben appeared to be nothing more than a ruffian with an ego to match. Their journey into the jungle is filled with danger, excitement and adventure.If you enjoyed Midnight Rainbow, you will love this longer, more indepth version of a trip through the jungle. At no time during this story was I bored. And yes, Linda's sexy love scenes are present in this book. You won't be disappointed with this one. Enjoy!!"
5,Perfect,A must-have movie for every household and church. We watched it with a 6-year old clear through to a senior citizens. All enjoyed it. All learned from it. I grew leaps and bounds by watching this film.
4,I Believe in Christ in Christmas!,I enjoyed the movie - the plot is typical in this form of show. Good overcomes bad with Christ's love. This is a message we need to get out much more often. Christ's love and forgiveness - we need to follow His example. Good job!
1,Worst Christmas DVD ever!,"First of all the DVD didn't play right it was all scrambled up, then when we did get a clear picture it had sub-titles, so I knew what they were going to say before they said it! What little I did watch of this movie I did NOT see what the other people who reviewed it saw. The main reason I purchased it was because the reviews were so good. Sorry but for me it was the worst christmas movie I've seen yet and I would NOT recommend it. The one good thing is amazon was great when I wanted to return it, so glad I purchased it from them! Thanks again amazon!!"
4,asome movie!!!!,"great movie, everyone should see this movie!i made my kids sit down and watch this movie,they loved it too.i will tell others to get this movie!!the only bad thing was that the case was broken when it arrived,the movie was ok ,just the case was broken,but no big deal!!!!"
1,Otterbox1000,OTTERBOX 1000 SERIES CLEAR WATERPROOF CASEI was very unhappy with this product. It was extremely hard for me to open and when I finally did get it open I was never able to close it. Returning it would be spending more money than the product was worth. I just went to Dicks Sporting Goods and got what I wanted and headed off to the beach. Now the open Otter box is just sitting here reminding me never to order online again. Sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but its the way it is.
4,Good but a little bit challenging to open,"Received the product prompt. Works well, waterproof but a little tricky to open. Fastens really tight but I guess that's why it waterproof. Overall, good product."
5,great product,Not much to say other than it works great no water gets in and holds perfect amount of stuff..only downside would be the latch is tough but obviously is a requirement for water tightness
3,Osse Opera presents Il Pirata,"Bellini's Il Pirata is an opera that is performed rare. That's unbelievable, because of the the beautiful music and interesting plot. The Osse Opera, a Dutch opera company, has the intention to perform rather unknown and rarely performed operas to ask the public's attention and offer the opportunity to enjoy them.Last month the Osse Opera was succesfull with its performance of Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco, which is rarely performed as well.Now we consider performing Il Pirata for the same reasons. We are looking for information about other recent performances of this Bellini opera and wish to communicate with performing companies that have recently played Il Pirata.Please contact us and add some information about your view on Il Pirata. ...Yours sincerely,Pierre Spierings"
2,Great Sound but a Disappointing Soprano,"I found Ms. Aliberti's voice thin and her interpretation of the role fairly inexpressive-little Bellinean passion. Caballe is still the choice for this opera- a great artist and a big beautiful voice. Callas, with mediocre sound on her CD, gives the most dramatic performance."
4,Lincoln City dog lover,"This is a very informative book with great illustrations. Just one thing missing, CANCER. Many of us with dogs, especially with older dogs, need all the information we can get on cancer. I'm still looking for the perfect dog health book."
4,Burn baby burn,"I've only done this once, and man did I feel the pain for 3 days. Simple moves and the time goes by quickly. I enjoy Jeanette Jenkins as a trainer. Glad I added this to my collection."
5,I love it..feel the burn,This DVD is great..I can really feel it no matter if it is my 1st or my 10th time!
5,REALLY WORKS THE BOOTY!,I LOVE JEANETTE AND I THINK I HAVE ALMOST ALL OF HER VIDEOS AND SHE'S A GREAT INSTRUCTOR...THE MOVES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND SHE MAKES THE WORKOUT FUN AND YOU FEEL THE BURN BUT IN A GOOD WAY!
4,Excellent mixer,"This is my first mixer, ever. I can't compare it to anything, but I can say that it blends my powders well.I had some confusion with the cleaning(no instructions), and when it stopped working I got the top portion open and there lay the instructions! I got it working again and it does a good job of blending smaller portions(~20 oz.) If you fill it all the way or almost, the plastic stirrers will have a hard time of mixing it."
3,Caps break and no longer manufactured,"Looks like Papermate doesn't make these anymore so you're probably getting old stock. I found the lids on mine cracked fairly easily and then wouldn't stay on the pen. Pretty much like a fineliner in terms of writing with. Great shade of purple too. Love these types of pens, more than gel pens, but the darned cap won't stay on once it cracks and that happens every time."
2,Not much of anything.,This DVD didn't have much of anything besides clips of Brad Pitt going around with paparazzis following him everywhere. Not much of infor. you couldn't get it from any of his biography. Badly done.
1,No Dimensions,It would be nice if amazon listed the dimensions of this stool so one would know what one is buying. One star only for no info.
4,A Learning Experience,"The book provided in-depth information about the program. It included all of the various aspects of running a real business, which gives some valuable experience for the real world. The program needed to be more user-friendly and provide more detail about the products being manufactured. Overall, it was a valuable lesson in working in a business environment."
4,Great video,"I got this video used and we really liked it. It has ""Radar"", from Mash, (can't think of name), reciting poetry about different animals, great classical music, with the musicians shown playing their instruments and great footage of animals in the zoo, dinosaur bones in a museum, etc. Lots of real footage of kids and adults and animals. I'd recommend this."
4,CrossFit Ready!,"My CrossFit trainer recommended this for me after about 6 months of training with the ones at our gym. I am a 5' 3"" woman and it works great for me. I had to trim off about 8 inches to make it work so it's more then long enough, however the trimming is a bit of a pain. This is a nice alternative to save a few bucks over the adult version."
3,Something isn't right...,"Tracks 12 and 13 seem to be switched around. Other than that, it plays. I guess that's all that matters."
3,Doesn't Do DVI-Digital,"I wanted to mirror the DVI output of my desktop computer to my monitor (which has a DVI connection) and my television (which only has VGA). This looks like it would work, but when I got it, it would only power one device at a time. I contacted the seller, and we worked out that DVI has two modes - analog and digital, while VGA only does analog. If my television had DVI-analog input, then it would have worked.Three stars because that really ought to be labeled somewhere.K"
2,only VGA works,"Great price and shipped really fast. But only the VGA signal works, the DVI end is bunk. Its cheaper to just buy a different brand than to pay shipping to send it back."
1,Horrible,"I purchased this item and received the wrong item. Ok, no big deal, Ill just exchange it. They sent me the ""real"" item and it was the wrong one again. DO NOT BUY FROM EFORCITY. their customer service is horrendous. They still haven't replied to my email wanting a refund."
3,analog and digital,"the covertor is pretty nice. the problem i had is not the convertor but with my set up. if you are trying to hook up digital and an analog source, like the X-box, you may run into problems. some TV's have a choice between digital and analog. so if you want your xbox to play you should make sure the other source being connected is analog too."
2,"Decent build quality, but it doesn't work....",I am pretty good with computers and electronics and this thing doesn't work on 2 differnt computers. I am using an MSI N9600GT OC.
4,"Great plot, awful politics","I read this book in middle school and loved it to pieces. I recently reread it as someone with a PhD in political science. The pronounced ethnocentrism and black-helicopter UN-phobia is jarring to me now, but the story is still compelling. In the end, the best character in the book is an inanimate probe. The book sets up nicely for a sequel, but is also a self-contained, intriguing story about a cry for help from a doomed race."
1,"""Story and Characters Plod Along""","Seventy pages into it and I put it down. I admit, the scenes with the probe and its thoughts were pretty neat. But when it came to the human characters and their efforts to move the story forward it fell flat. The probe shows up as a mysterious glow in space. While the UN launches an investigation, that seems to take a back seat to other subplots that failed to grab my interest."
5,THE Ultimate album,"What can I say? I've been following the Kwede's career since I saw him in a little bar in Philly 10 years ago, ever since I've been one of the many ""kwede groupies"". What's not to like about this album or any of his albums for that matter? Everything he touches turns to pure gold. I hope to God the Kwede never goes away, because that would be a sad, sad, day in music history. Buy this album and you will be hooked from the first song. You will love his delivery and his pure, raw talent that you rarely find in this day and age. I give this album a 3 thumbs up!!!"
3,Interesting book but one-sided,"I'm a big Kraftwerk fan. The band is famous for being very tight with personal info. So I was very curious to read the ""tell-all"" by ex-drummer Wolfgang Flur. First you have to accept that everything in the book is from his own point of view. That said it has some facinating insights to what goes on inside Kling Klang studios. It also has some hilarious backstage pics. Wolfgang definitely feels like Ralph Hutter screwed him over and that the rest of the band defers (maybe cowers) to his authority. Wolfgang definitely comes off a little bit like a drama queen but I think most of what he writes is true. I recommend this book to any Kraftwerk fans looking inside info. There certainly isn't much else like this book available."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS YOU MIGHT THINK...,"I have already placed a review of this book at brit site www.amazon.co.uk but in brief: maybe just one third of the book is interesting, the rest consists of page after page of advertising for Time pie album, Herr Flür's barroque writting style and quite ill feelings against Kraftwerk's founding members because he never felt like ""one of the pack"" in his own non-objective view. If you are interested, check the english site for the reviews, there are not too many, but they are poignant."
4,"WHY, RODOLFO??? Why???","The RAIMUNDOS was the most famous band from the rock scene on Brazil in the 90's...They recorded masterpieces like their debut and LAVO TÁ NOVO and LAPADAS DO POVO...SO NO FOREVIS is the last album with Rodolfo on the vocals...He was a truly gifted vocalist by the Brazilian parameter of a rock singer... But then he went nuts and go to the church to became some religious freak!!!! Why, Rodolfo??? THEY BRAINWASHED YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!"
4,Art Deco Miami,"This book is full of lovely, vintage black & white photos of Miami by one of the most well-known photographers of his time. It touches all bases from fashion, to architecture, to commercial advertising, as well as personal photos of individuals and the social life of the time. I found it to be very interesting and nostalgic."
1,Didn't work,"I already had a set which were a christmas tree and a snowflake. I wanted different ones so I ordered these. Needless to say we made them for christmas and we still only had a tree and snowflake. I followed all the directions and I am familiar with how to make them, so it wasn't me. They didn't hold the batter and they made a mess. I do not recommend them at all."
2,These are NOT cast iron,"I bought these because the description says they are cast iron. They are NOT cast iron. They are aluminum. I even had my materials scientist husband look at them and he confirmed they were not cast iron. The reason why it is better to have cast iron is because the iron holds the heat better when you are heating the irons in the oil and when you dip them in the batter the batter will cook onto the iron because it is so hot. Because these were aluminum when dipping the iron into the batter, the batter didn't stick as well because it was not as hot. Hence, very thin pretzels.I tried these anyway. They were ok, but cast iron ones are better."
4,Memories,"I liked the iron. We used to make these cookies when we were kids. But I thought they were a handed down family thing until I saw the iron on-line. At that time I had to buy the set to relive old memories. This one worked as I remember the old one we used when I was a kid, except it holds two irons at once making it twice as fast as the single iron we had back in the day. It worked well, little sticking, easy cleanup, the rest of the kitchen, not so much."
4,Good quality and price,"I was impressed with the quality and number of irons in this set. It makes really delicious cookies and fun to make. It was difficult to get the irons onto the handle as the prongs needed to be pulled apart. Once you separate them as the instructions say, it works perfectly. I'd reccomend this iron. Can't wait to get new designs for all the holidays :)) It came within the specified timeframe and in perfect condition."
5,LOVE IT,"Delivery was prompt, packaging was secure and Product is AMAZING! I had not one problem with this Rosette Iron. You must separate the prongs to 3"" or more when you first get it because it is compact in the box and it even tells you to do so in the instructions. Rosettes came off the iron without a problem. The design irons screw on easy to the base and STAY without loosening up. PERFECT Cookies and a great childhood memory brought back to me. I highly recommend them!"
5,"great product,great service","I received my brands in the mail so quickly! I am now forced to finish my work week salivating to try them out. These brands are excellent quality and construction! Thank you for a new Holiday Tradition!Update: These brands work amazing. The arms are a little difficult to get seperated far enough apart, but keep pulling and they will go. This set includes the brands to make cookies or cups. Fantastic! A VERY good buy!"
5,Hats off to the fine people at Sharpie,"I bought a pack of these Sharpies awhile back, and they really do the trick. Before I bought this indispensable product, I was relegated to the mundane world of the ball point, and lead based writing apparati. Now that I have my four pack of Sharpies, I am writing like I've never written before. Don't hesitate to spend your hard earn dollar on these fine writing utensils."
4,A wonderful and fun book!,"Winter can be a cold, lonely and dangerous time for a bird that didn't fly south. But in The Bird in Santa's Beard, help comes from Santa Claus himself. Santa invites the cold and hungry bird to nest in the warm safety of his beard. During the long winter Santa and the bird develop a deep friendship. They solve problems and share the secret of Santa's helpers. And when Christmas morning arrives, Santa receives a grand gift just for him.The Bird in Santa's Beard is the story of an unlikely friendship between Santa and a bird and how a simple kindness makes a difference.I so enjoyed learning how Santa came to have all of his helpers. Children will enjoy this book with a subtle and important message. The photographs are wonderful and a nice change of pace from other illustrated books. The cover is exactly the way I have always pictured jolly old Santa.Armchair Interviews says: This is a splendid addition to a child's Christmas library."
5,Bird in Santa's Beard,"Gorgeous photography, and good explanation for all of ""Santa's Helpers"". Story is kind of choppy, but it's as good as any other Christmas book about Santa out there."
2,11 out of 12 ain't bad?,"Sharpies are great, no question about it. But my pack of 12 only came with 11 markers. Very disappointing. Sure, it's only a marker, but how can that get screwed up?"
4,Best price I could fjnd,"Needed for work, we use a lot if them labeling packages. I haven't used yet but aam happy with purchase. Would buy again."
1,Soft and mushy. Writes like a paint brush.,"These are described as 'sharp with a fine point'. They are the opposite. The points are soft and mushy!! I need something to write on a plastic freezer bag for storage. They don't work, period, despite these reviews. The point is so soft & mushy you can't write any letter that is articulate. I suppose if you write on something big, like a poster, they might work, but NOT for ordinary sizes. Even on letter size they are worthless because the points are so soft that when you try to write each individual letter its like trying to write with a paint brush! (If you want to paint something black then you might consider these lol) There should be a way to give stuff like this a minus star for junk. I'm grateful for Amazon's 5-star return policy that allows me to send these back without paying for shipping."
1,very disappointed,Every single marker in the box was defective! It seems as if the ink was dried up...I had to have a scrap sheet of paper handy before using these pens so that I could get them started by scribbling on the scrap paper first. A real pain!
1,Ruined my whiteboards,Bought a 12 pack for my building and ended up with 12 ruined whiteboards (these are expensive whiteboards). Will not come off.
5,The standard in black permanent markers,Great price...Prime shipping. The standard in permanent black (or any color for that matter) markers. Definitely a go to writing implement at both home and work. I use them to label anything and everything. Two of my most frequent uses are labeling CDs I burn and laundry items. The ink stays on these items forever and continues to look crisp after years of use and washes (for the clothes only of course).
5,What a bargain!!!,"At the store, 2 Sharpie markers cost $3.00. Here I got 12 Sharpie markers for $4.00! Tried out all the markers when I got them and they all work. Not a single dry one in the bunch! And not some cheap copycat, they really are Sharpies! So glad I didn't buy from the store... it would have cost me $18.00 for the same dozen!"
5,Sharpies Do The Job,"The dozen Black fine point Sharpies arrived very promptly, and as sharpies are, good right out of the box. Things need marking and writing on, and Sharpies are the leader in the field. I recently ordered a variety color assortments for a friend of mine who is going to college. She is eager to start marking in multiple colors. Sharpies are fun! You probably shouldn't give them to little kids."
5,Great value,I love these markers and the way they write. 12 in a box is a good value here on Amazon.com.Press the yes button if you agree
2,perplexed and disappointed,"Gee, tried one out of the box immediately after they arrived. It acted as though it had been laying around without the cap on for one or two days. Tried another with the same result. This is not what I was expecting based on the great preponderance of glowing reviews. I have given 6 of the pens to my school teacher daughter without sharing my results. I will update this review when I get feedback from her"
4,Sweet but predictable,I really enjoy this author's new series about the 500 kingdoms and absolutely loved the Fairy Godmother (the first book in the hopefully long series) which is why I grabbed the second book. I was somewhat disappointed only because the story turned out to be somewhat predictable. The loop hole involving George was definitely to run of the mill and seems to be the pervading theme in these books. Which isn't bad I just wish there was a little more surprise going on. Also the romance between the main character and her honey definitely seemed like an afterthought to me. Like the author thought it was a requirement for the story and so decided to throw it in sometime while the story was wrapping up.That being said; the writing and humor was entertaining and the story was interesting. A very nice book for light reading. I'll definitely be picking up whatever comes next.
4,A solid addition to the Five Hundred Kingdoms.,"""One Good Knight"" was a great story. It was somewhat different than I'd expected, coming into the book; the first Five Hundred Kingdoms book, ""The Fairy Godmother,"" involved high-level manipulation of the Tradition and and the story archetypes that comprise it. I really enjoyed those elements. ""One Good Knight"" was more tightly focused, following the events in a single Kingdom and a girl caught up in the forces of the Tradition, and how she is able to deal with the situation. This made for an engaging story, but a story of a different type. Perhaps it was just my take, but I also found the romantic subplot a little... abrupt? I just had a hard time getting emotionally involved in it. I did, however, love the political machinations of the antagonists, and the creative ways that the protagonists found to solve their problems. All in all, I thought it was a good, solid story, even if it wasn't everything I'd imagined. Definitely worth a read."
5,Mercedes Lackey Does a great job,Very well written. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing. Mercedes Lackey has definitely not lost her touch. If you enjoy fantasy this is well worth thee read.
3,I Happen to Agree,"With most of the other reviews here. This is not a great book, and falls drastically short of the Fairy Godmother book, which was a quick, interesting read. This one repeats things too often, seems rushed with characters that are not fleshed out enough. The ending is also a happy one, but cliched, a little silly, rushed and miserably done. There just was not enough leading up to it to warrant that sort of an ending. The love story portion could have used alot more work as well. This is one awkward romance that is only lightly touched upon. All in all, a decent read, but nothing too memorable. I hope the series continues because this world is one that is just asking for a great book to come out of it. The possibilities are so endless, but Lackey does not explore them in this rehash fantasy. A shame..."
5,One Good night,"Fairy tale, fantasty, a touch of romance and very good story line wraped up in one book. Mercedes Lackey has once again shown us what a great writer she is. My teenage grandaugter loved it too!"
2,Well...,Although I'm not a Mercedes Lackey fan and didn't actually like this book...It's a bestiality romance novel! That's worth a few bucks just for the s**** and giggles factor.
5,a good tale,"Since Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite authors, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series. It was a really great read."
3,A little young...,"I loved The Fairy Godmother, I adore the entire 500 kingdoms premise, and this one fits in, but its for a much younger audience. In One Good Knight, friendship takes the place of any hint of romance. ie., no kissing, no fondling, no sexual tension, only strong companionship and platonic hugs for emotional support. A great basis for love, granted, but a friendship ring at the end would have been just as acceptable as wedding bells.The writing is the usual crisp and witty Lackey style and for that alone I recommend reading One Good Knight, but not if you're looking for romantic chemistry, a complex plot, truly evil villians or dazzling magic. Everything is toned down for a YA or female Harry Potter audience.FYI: Do NOT read the synopsis on the fly cover of the book, it gives away the one and only mild surprise in the story."
2,"Okay, but her other books much better","I love many of this author's books, especially Fairy Godmother, and the concept of Tradition. However, in this book she seems to use the Tradition as a crutch. The story is entirely predictable and formulaic, which most readers would find annoying, at the very least, in any other novel, but it seems that because she acknowledges that weakness, it's okay. The book is well written, but essentially boring. I felt very disappointed by this novel. If you really want to know what it's about, read the inside cover. That's pretty much all you need to know about this book."
3,Good beginner's book,"This is a good book for beginners with close-up photographs, not drawings. It is pocket size and great for getting children interested in wildlife. However, it covers too broad an area to be comprehensive. We regularly see snakes, frogs and skinks in our yard that are not included here- whereas we don't need to be able to readily identify snakes that do not live in this area. If you need more complete coverage, I recommend the Peterson field guide for your specific area."
5,Should Be Required Reading,"If I had sufficient funds at my disposal, I would send a copy of this book to every legislator, policymaker, prosecutor, judge, and mental health and drub rehabilitation provider. Lonny Shavelson has written a well-researched, compelling, and exquisitely human book about people tortured both by their psychological and drug afflictions and by the systems charged with helping them. After reading this book, I cannot imagine that anyone could successfully argue against the obvious: 1) that we must shift the majority of the ""war on drugs"" money from enforcement to treatment, 2) that we must reform and integrate the drug treatment and mental health systems, 3) that we must reorganize social service systems (housing, medical care, children's services, etc.) to deliver coordinated services, and 4) given the precursors to most drug addiction (child abuse and mental health issues), rethink where we spend drug prevention dollars."
4,our rehab process,drug rehab right between the eyes that pulls no pun ches and shows us where we need to go next
3,Hooked,This book came in good condition and in good timing but it is not what is shown in the picture/description -- a little disappointed.
3,Wordy but insightful...,"If you are in the addictions field, this book is good for opening your eyes to the other side of the issue. It has in depth encounters with other treatment facilities and shows where they go wrong and what they do right. This book does show the flaws in the system. Worth a read, even if it does go on and on about certain things that really aren't necessary."
2,Not so great!,"Bought it, tried it and returned it. It's a good idea, but it's just not such a great product. I heard the newer version is better. The one I got is kind of cute (it's pink ) and could be a toy for older kids, but as a child locator, it just doesn't work that well. I am not sure if the battery is old or something else is wrong."
1,"Great idea, very disappointing product","I thought this was a clever idea for helping me find my toddler in a department store. It was $20 wasted. First it took 4 1/2 months to get because of backorders getting pushed back. Second, it isn't loud enough in most stores because the beep can not be heard most of the time over the music. Works fine if the store is fairly empty and playes subdued music. Third, after a month it stopped beeping. It buzzed and vibrated for hours. I took the battery out hoping to reset the bug. This didn't work. The buzzing continued after replacing the battery with a new one. I don't know if I just got a dud but it's overpriced and failed me miserably."
1,I can't hear you,Good idea but does not work. The bug's siren is so quiet there is no way I would trust the safty of my child with this thing. I thought it was going to be loud like the person alarms that make that high pitch sound.
1,little value,I bought this for my son when he turned 2 as he is a runner. He thought it was cute but there was no way we keep him from removing it from his clothes as it just clips on. We tried butting it in a pocket of his clothes but could not get it to work. We were better served by the backpack monkey harness. I couls have sold 20 of those in the airport during out trip.
3,Not loud enough in a crowded place,"This product is good in a department store if it's relatively quiet, but not good where there's a lot of people like in the food court or a lot of background noise. When you test it at home it sounds very loud, but when there's a lot of noise like when we went to the rodeo carnival, it wasn't loud enough."
2,Giggle bug tracker not loud enough,I took the Giggle bug with us to a stock show. It was inside a large building with lots of people and you could not hear the beep with the child right next to you unless you listened really carefully. The beep is not loud enough.
3,Disappointing find on much-loved breed,"The book seems readily available and has quite good information on Scotties, however the style is outdated and very anecdotal. Well-priced with ample picture of the breed although not superb quality print. Too small a section devoted to the breed, more than half the book is general dog information. Compared to books available on other breeds this book is a dissappointing find."
5,Wonderful!,This book is truly wonderful! The author captures the spirit of the Norse times perfectly. He keeps the myths true to the originals and manages to make it an exciting read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Norse mythology and to whoever enjoys a good book.
1,Poor choice,"This is an erudite and scholarly treatment of the anthropology of the Norse myths. It is advertised as a book for youth, and it is not."
3,An easy read,"I liked this book, especially since the author drew from sources beyond Snorri. However, at the same time the author took liberties with the stories by adding conversations between characters that didn't take place in the original versions. That's fine for story telling, but to discuss the text with others you have to be able to recognize the difference between what the author added to the stories and what was in the originals. I was also disappointed that he did not include the complete text of Havamal or Voluspa. Otherwise this was an enjoyable introduction to Norse mythology."
4,Must-have reference.,"Finally I've found it: the book of tales of Odin, and Thor, and Bifrost, and Ragnarok! What a pleasure to read the tales that inspired so much of the world's fantasy literature! Here you'll find the background stories behind and the likes of Beowulf, the Nibelungenlied or the Volsungs' Saga, and obviously the roots of Professor Tolkien's own Middle-Earth mythology, so numerous are the similarities.Not only are the thirty-two myths comprised in this translation very well told and captivating, but the introduction and notes are very complete and interesting, not to mention the very practical glossary and index. I haven't read Snorri Sturluson's Edda so I can't compare, but I'm pretty sure Kevin Crossley-Holland's is one of the best reference books on the subject, a must-have on one's shelf."
5,The best intro to the Norse Mythos,"This book is the best intro to the Norse Myths. The authors retelling of the tales is accurate, entertaining and educational. If you are interested in Asatru, Odinism or just the mythos get this book!"
4,Good book,"I didn't get the cover I was hoping for, but the book is good quality and I do enjoy the myths inside."
5,Great Book,"I have changed jobs and havent had time to finish reading it, but it is really awesome. It came highly recommended by my husband."
5,JAMES F. WRIGHT RISING STAR!,"WAITING FOR MY WIFE WHILE IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE SHE SUGGESTED THAT I LISTEN TO THIS NEW CD CALLED ""THE CAPTAIN"". IT WAS LIKE READING A BEST SELLER FOR THE FISRT TIME. ONE YOU JUST CAN'T PUT DOWN. I LISTENED TO EVERY SONG FROM BEGINING TO END AND WAS TOUCHED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF MR. WRIGHT'S VOICE. WITH A POLISHED AND MATURE VOICE HE MADE EACH SONG UNIQUELY HIS OWN. HE IS AN EXTREME TALENT BEING GIFTED NOT ONLY IN VOICE BUT ARTISTICLY IN LYRIC AND INSTUMENTAL. THE SONGS WERE NOT ONLY PERFORMED BY HIM BUT MOST WERE WRITTEN BY HIM IN SCORE AND LYRIC.EACH SONG WAS INSPIRING AND PERSONALLY UPLIFTING SO I CAN'T GIVE A PERSONAL FAVORITE, I LIKED THEM ALL. ""THE CAPTAIN"" IS A CD THAT I WILL ENJOY LISTENING TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN.IT IS ONE THAT WILL BE ENJOYED BY LISTENING GROUPS OF ALL AGES. WE ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE NEXT CD BY JAMES F. WRIGHT."
5,A sequel worth waiting for.....,"Part 2 of A Garden In Paris continues the story of Mary Davis and her daughter Liz. It is also the story of the incredible men who cross their paths. Mary is a widow who, though dedicated to her husband while alive, searches for a future in remnants of the past. Leaving Omaha, she finds herself in Paris.Liz roots herself in Omaha and all the illusions it holds. When her fiancé asks for more than just continuing her past, to shape their future, Liz balks.The characters are well developed. I found myself strongly disliking one character, but this person grew as a person to the point I found understanding, acceptance and forgiveness.This book is a tribute to the author's versatility in moving from historical to contemporary fiction. Thanks for the gift of story!"
5,Families and Future,"A Hilltop in Tuscany is the second of a two book series. Ms. Whitson continued with her insights into family, personal growth and the importance of faith in their lives. We came to know the characters in her first book, A Garden in Paris. Her characters are real, not perfect and at times quite unloveable. A mother learns to challenge herself and think beyond her self identity as a wife and mother. How quickly she learns that life is not all black, nor is it all white. A daughter must learn to look at her motivations and believe she can still retain her sense of self by looking to her heart; to put others before her. Ms. Whitson shares the importance of faith without cramming it down the reader's throat. I was impressed and have now starting reading some of her other books."
5,Lost & Found,"...Kweder has done us all a great favor with the release of Kwederology Vols. I and II. ALL the great stuff is there, with plenty to spare. This collection does more than span the entire spectrum of human experience - it simply takes aim and blows the spectrum to smithereens with a sawed-off 12 guage, in much the way Johnny Cash did with his American Recordings about ten years ago.Folks, this is a rare opportunity to own a great collection of uncompromising music with intelligence, humor, and the knowledge of what we all really think about when we're on the edge. From the manic to the depressive, from the silly to the deeply insightful, this is what the music business has been missing...Buy two or three copies. You'll wear 'em all out. And if you don't, I'LL buy 'em, because I'm already wearing out my first copy and will need to replace it soon."
4,Quiet interior pump,"We use this pump to power an indoor fountain. It needs to raise the water about 7 feet, so this has sufficient head for this. We needed it quiet enough so that it didn't distract from the sound of the water flowing. It is the quietest pump I have found and fairly power efficient. This is the 4th one we have had and they seem to have a lifetime of about 2 years. We run it 24/7."
1,This film SUCKED!!!,Stormy Nights is another pointless film coming from some cheap production company in some little warehouse. i thought this film sucked. It had no plot and you can not follow the story well. It was ignerent.
4,Some Good Points,"This book is good for beginners, it has a few good ideas in it. The Behavioral vs. RTL versions of the code is pretty useless, but the RTL vs. Simulation versions are useful. Getting a quick and dirty unit test bench up and running is a good idea. But DO NOT USE THE ASYNCHRONOUS FIFO. It does not work. If you are crossing clock boundaries, this is not the way to do it!"
2,"Should be renamed to ""Verilog Beginner's Library""","I am a power user of Verilog. I have ""all"" the books on Verilog. I bought this book just to make sure that my library is complete. Atleast 1/3rd of this book is complete waste. Who writes behavioral code for counters and adders? Behavioral code section for all the modules is unnecessary. Author should remove them and save paper (save trees too). Behavioral code is used in real life to simulate parts of design which can not be described in RTL like memories or some processor macros and not to describe simple designs.A real life designer will never keep such simple models in his library. Most models are suitable as a starting guide for a beginner. I think book should be renamed as ""Verilog Beginner's Library""BTW I will surely congratulate author for collecting many different kinds of models in one place. I give 2 stars for this effort."
5,Die Goldene Hitparade Des Herzens (Max Greger),His best cd ever done. All tracks (13/14) are genious. Max's sound is unique on that cd. Very very good cd to listen by the fire. It is very romantic.
4,Study Guide to Accompany Medical-Surgical Nursing Care,"good book, received in a timely manner and the price was good."
4,I am glad about this purchase,The first thing am happy about is it came by fast (with in 4 days) and it was in a better condition than I expected to be. Thankyou
1,Very limited usefulness,First half basic passing drills. Second half covers basic and limited information on formations.
5,Useless Japanese Inventions,This book is absolutely hilarious! We gave it out as a Christmas gift to friends and they all got a great kick out of it. Each page is funnier than the previous. Definitely a great gift for a hard to buy for person.
4,Get this for the inventor in your life.,"Almost everyone thinks of these type of things, just part of being human. These guys really make them! LOL There are other books like this, I think I have three.-63 years young."
2,Another free downloader....,"I give this cd two stars for two decent tracks, and that is being generous. These guys should have stuck to releasing the occasional single. ... Why buy this retro rehash when you can still find the originals they are trying so hard to emulate? Please check out L.F.O.'s ""Frequencies"", or 808 States' ""Utd. State 90"" before spending your hard earned cash on this one."
1,BUYERBEWARE!,This cd commits the single sin for which there is no forgiveness in music. . . it's BORING!
1,B-25 One helluva bomber,"Although the reviews say that this DVD can be played in all regions, this one does'nt play in Australia on a DVD player, it only plays on a computer.I hope this does not turn out to be a common problem. Otherwise the DVD was very good to watch on the computer, with some exellent old footage."
5,A gem,"This is one fabulous kickboxing dvd - always my go to when I only have 45 minutes or so to spare and need to feel revitatlised. Jeannette Jenkins is a terrific instructor - she explains and cues well, and is cheerful without being annoyingly upbeat. There are no time for breaks here, but the two strength intervals let you catch your breath even though your limbs might be initially screaming... all in a good way -this is a truly effective workout and you won't believe how good you feel after you've done it. I've previously done the 10 minute solutions kickbox dvds (with Jessica Smith and Keli Roberts) : this one is much more intense.Agree that the music is could be much better, as could the production values and set, but once you get kicking, punching and doing all those repeater knees under Jeannette's excellent instruction, it won't really matter."
4,Easy and delicious dishes every time!,What a great book this is. The recipes are written clearly and concisely. Some of my children's favorite chicken dishes - I discovered in this book.Any cookbook that can accomplish that is tops with me. It wasn't until a friend of mine borrowed the book from me that I realized how much I depended on it. I've gone to grab the book 3 or 4 times in the two weeks she's had it - now I'm buying a copy for her as a gift.
4,Good book,"I like the book, the recipes are fairly simple and don't use too many ingredients that aren't readily available. My only wish is that the book had more pictures."
4,An excellent and easy to use reference for preparing chicken,"I have purchased many cookbooks and downloaded a large amount of recipes in my life, yet when it comes to chicken, this is one of my primary sources to turn to for ideas.The book is organized into well thought out groupings, such as Chicken Lite, International, grilling, oven meals, etc. with easy to read recipes. One of my all time favorites coes from this book and many of my ""mainstays"" originated from here as well.With 365 recipes to choose from, you can eat chicken every day of the year and not repeat a dish once!"
5,My very first cookbook ...,As many can attest (at my voluminous list of chicken dishes - from salads to pies) where the last thing the chicken is -- is 'boring') this was my very first cookbook when I graduated from high school. Some of my 'secret recipes' were found first in what I learned from this wonderful author.
5,One of the best cookbooks I own,"I bought this cookbook 20 years ago when I was first married and overall it has the best chicken recipies out there. 20 years later, this book is still my staple for many of my favorite recipies and I have copied many of the recipies for my family and friends at their request. Now my daughter makes many of the dishes featured in the book.Make sure you try the chicken marsala and the honey bbq wings but all of the recipies are terrific."
4,Puller Biography,"This is a pretty good addition to the information available about Lewis Burwell Puller, the beloved, legendary Chesty of The United States Marine Corps. While not terribly ""deep"" -- it is, after all, a one-hour TV show -- it does give some insight into the man behind the myth.For more detailed background, DO NOT rely on the Burke Davis book (written in conjunction with Chesty, and, therefore, suspect in slant and detail). Instead, rely on Colonel Jon T. Hoffman's ""Chesty"", a well-written, impartial examination of the life of this extraordinary man."
3,it's ok.,"I've tried the shaker on several protein mixes and numerous fruit mixes. It does an average job. Period. My blender is much better (and yes, a lot more to clean up). I even lowered my expecations to about zero when I tried the shaker....sigh. Still didn't excel. If you get it for under two bucks then get it, otherwise I'm sorry to say it is just average and not worth 5 or higher."
3,does its job,"Does its job for the price. It could be a little better designed, not sure it's completely spill proof either, but seems okay so far. Shipping was more than itshould have been."
5,Works great for everything and anything!,"This product is truly amazing. I've never seen anything like this before, and for the price, it's practically a steal.The label says you can mix anything with it, and it's 100% true. You can mix powdered shakes, lemonade, Crystal Light, coffee, smoothies ANYTHING! This thing is really great and incredibly durable. It's easy to wash out, too.You will be very surprised at how leak-proof it is. You won't spill a single drop--not even one!Definitely worth the buy--and so inexpensive, too!"
1,Rubber lining sucks,"Rubber lining came out and now it leaks so I threw it away, waste of time and money in my experience."
3,No title,"This brand was a little cheaper made than the one I was trying to duplicate. One of the two I bought, had a crack in it, so it leaked everywhere, had to throw away."
2,I absolutely **HATE** this shaker.......,"I have numerous shaker glasses in my cabinets to mix my protein drinks and supplements. This is my absolute least favorite and I'm tempted to toss it in the garbage each time I use it. It doesn't seal well, no matter how tightly you twist it closed. You always end up with sticky hands and dribbles running down the side of the glass during your workout. Any supplement that fizzes/foams when mixed, like N.O. Explode, etc. absolutely is a no-no with this shaker.If you're looking for a good shaker, don't frustrate yourself and settle for this one.... keep looking."
4,Shaker Cup,Works well. The only problem I've had is sometimes a little powder gets stuck in the spout and doesn't mix in.
4,"A good shaker, with only slight problems.","This shaker is a good size, and is shaped well so that you can get your fingers into the grooves on the side while shaking it (preventing accidentally throwing the thing across the room). I also like how it has a separate air hole opposite the drinking cap so that you can consume the mixed drink right from the shaker w/out having to dirty another cup.The only problem with it, which was annoying, is that the rubber O-ring in the cap comes off occasionally, and is very difficult to put back into the groove in the cap. You almost have to press down on the top while unscrewing the lid of the cup for fear that the thing will come off."
2,Ultimate??? don't think so,I bought two of these and they both leak. If you are not very careful about putting the lid back on it leaks while shaking and drinking. It does a good job in breaking up the powder. Over all I would look for something else next time.
2,Does not brake down protein powder,"I purchased this item about a month ago exclusively to prepare and drink my post-workout protein shakes (soy milk + soy or whey protein powder).I was very disappointed to find out it actually does not break up the protein powder and it leaves lumps behind, making it very unpleasant to drink. I am not impressed by this product at all, and don't understand why other people gave it 5 stars. If you are thinking on buying this shaker to have protein shakes please do not do so, it will not break out the protein no matter how hard you try to mix it."
2,The cover comes off too easily,"This product could have been better if the flip-cover didn't break so easily. Even when it wasn't ""broken"" the annoying flip-cover kept on coming off too easily. I personally did not like this product because of that. If they make a better cover it would have worked great."
1,Better products on the market,Don't waste your money. Doesn't hold very much and the lid always leaks. Mine started falling apart after half a dozen times in the dishwasher.
3,Mix feelings.,"bought two at the same time. One of them,the rubber lining on the cap of the bottle fell out and can not be put back in after about using if for three month. The second one is still good."
2,"So-so for some things, completely unacceptable for others","If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like ""Ionic Fizz"" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid. Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it.I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't waste your money on it."
1,Junk,Not worth 5 cents! It leaks and the small cap broke with a few weeks of use. If you put the cap on too tight or too loose liquid flies out everywhere and sometimes the threads are hard to match up making it a real PITA to use.I use a bicycle water bottle or even a mason jar with lid over this piece of junk.
5,Power Shaker,"For the price, I was very pleased with this product. It mixes my powered shakes very well, goes straight into the top shelf of my dishwasher and is ready for the next use! This is a nice product and if the ones I have wear out, I'll buy more!"
2,"Cheap price, cheaply made","At first, this seems like a pretty good drink shaker. The body and lid are fairly sturdy. However, there's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid... And if that pops out, which it's prone to do with mine, you're left with a leaky (and therefore useless) shaker. The seal can be replaced with a bit of effort, but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle?"
1,Ultimate Shaker Bottle STINKS!!,This plastic bottle had a rotten odor that I couldn't get out even with bleach. All I used it for was to make protein shakes. I threw it in the trash!
3,You get what you pay for.,"I've had this shaker for about a year and have to note a few things...- Overall, I liked this shaker. it lasted about about a year before breaking.- Never had a problem with leaking as some other reviewers stated.- After 7 months, the latch cap broke, but the cap still workedWould I buy this product again?There's better out there."
2,You get what you pay for,"These are cheap protein shake bottles. They look cheap. They feel cheap. That is all ok. The problem is that the lid doesn't make a good seal so they also leak. I still use them because I didn't want to pay for the GNC brand ones, I only use this after a work out when I'm already sweaty. If I'm making a shake in the morning before work I use something else because I've had this drip onto my hands and shirt way too many times."
1,had major dents right out of the box,"Length:: 1:02 Minskegerator itself is nice, but it had severe dents on the top edges(corners)that are very ugly. I don't know if it was due to shipping or if it was already dented before it went out. Either way I am ok with keeping it, since I don't want to go thru the hassle of returning it. I thought that I should be compensated a percentage of my money back though. I have submitted pictures to Amazon about this and nobody has bothered to contact me at all about this. I guess when you buy something here on Amazon you are rolling the dice. The customer service is definitely lacking."
3,Too Small for some kegs,"Only the straight vertical 1/2 barrel metal kegs will fit.Any plastic 1/2 barrel keg or those with a rounded center can not fit into the cooler.Otherwise, the unit operates efficiently and quietly.The first pull always foams a little."
5,works great,"Easy to assemble hoses/fittings/tower. Plenty of spare parts. Beer stays cold The regulator is sensitive to increase/decrease pressure. It is cold-wall construction, the copper tubes for freon extend around the sides. The CO2 bottle that it comes with is good for approx 3 kegs. Be sure to get a second one for backup so the beer doesn't go flat. Great addition for football season!"
4,Great Kegerator!,"I bought this Kegerator earlier this year, and it has been great for the price. I am a homebrewer, and have converted it to use Ball Lock kegs.PROS:Great Price (I bought it for $350)Comes with a mini CO2 tank, and regulator, so if you want to keg homebrew you can convert it for $20 or so.Fits 2 ball lock kegs and a full size CO2 tank if you want to buy oneTemperature can be controlled from the backThe front door is rounded so you can fit extra!The wheels on the bottom are great because you can move it around as neededCONS:Loud... it has a loud hum to itTakes a lot of power, which is noticeable in my apartment (the lights flicker when it switches on)The tap gets gummed up if you don't use it every day.The CO2 tank started leaking after 6 monthsOverall though, this has a high recommendation from me. Especially for the price!"
4,Bought it because of the good reviews.,"A couple of days after placing my order, Amazon stopped carrying it. I got it for 350 shipped using Amazon prime. The rubber gasket for the tower made it real difficult to assemble, but I filed down the plastic tabs to increase the clearance. I took about .25mm off each one and brute forced the sucker on. You need the rubber gasket or else cold air will leak from the top. The gasket was attached to the hole plug in the packaging. I do not recommend the casters. I put them on and it did not roll smoothly. But since you puncture part of the Styrofoam insulation installing the casters, I feel like its not a reversible decision. The unit is as loud as an old dishwasher when placed on an linoleum floor. Currently, the temp inside the empty fridge is 32 degrees with the dial set halfway between min and max. I hope to pick up my first keg today and I'll let you know how it goes.It cost me $5.99 to fill the CO2 canisters at the local liquor supply.edit: spelling"
5,Great Product,The Nostalgia KRS-2100 is great! Keeps beer nice and cold and you can't beat the price. Set up took a bit of time because we couldn't find the instruction manual but once we did it wasn't too difficult to assemble. We've had it for over a month now and haven't had any problems. Great buy.
2,Buy the More Expensive Model,Cheap parts. The regulator failed immediately - I had to spend $70 on a replacement from Micromatic. The tower and faucet are poor quality. I should have bought the higher quality kegerator.
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"I purchased this product in January 2011. Shipment was delayed because of the weather, which is completely understandable. The package was delivered to my satisfaction, but the product itself is total crap. Set up was fairly easy, but the regulator sent with this machine was a complete waste of money. We went through 2 bottles of CO2 within a week (should have lasted up to 4 kegs). So I took the regulator to a local welding supply and they tested it. Multiple leaks and failure to maintain constant pressure - which basically means it wont work. We had the option of either buying another regulator that retails anywhere from 50-200 bucks or give up. After all the hassle I was VERY ready to give up, even with a half full keg of beer to return.... ugh!!"
1,"bad instructions, missing parts","after building as per included instructions, all i get is foam. after watching the youtube video mentioned in some of the other complaints, i realized that the gentleman in the video has parts that were not included with my kegerator."
4,Mancave!!!,This Kegerator is perfect minor adjustments made but very happy i would recommend this great for the price! Man cave!!
1,Poor Product,"Poor product. Had to return. Beer doesn't get cold, directions are horrible, and i'm pretty sure the product complete broke within 48 hours. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you like warm beer."
2,Don't do it,"Arrived damaged. Twice. First one didn't even reach 40 degrees. Second one got cold enough but was also damaged. Cheap workmanship = cheaper $ than others. Get what you pay for. Amazon good about returns, perhaps UPS is to blame for damage. Bought a real fridge for garage. Will make a kegerator out of it instead."
1,piece of krap,Day 3 with my FOAMALATER set rgulater to 10 foam adjusted the temp foam turned everything off reinstalled everything now all i get is the co2 blowing out the release valve junk sending back.
3,Not too shabby,"This entry level kegerator is much better than I thought it would be.Pros-C02 tankDual gauge regulatorCastersQuietKept beer to about 34-36 degreesNice Standard and self closing tapGreat drip trayNice priceExtra O-rings etcCons-Too small inside (will not accommodate ""A System"" coupler kegs (primarily german)Small CO2 tankUnable to purchase spare parts (try their website)In the end, the small size was a no-go for me. Returned it."
1,Low price but very low quality kegerator,"I got this kegerator in December 2011 and I've been happy with how cold it keeps the beer. However, there are a lot of problems with this kegerator:1. Really poor quality casters. This isn't a huge deal but because they have a ridge down the center and no give, they left lines in our floor when rolled.2. Moderately loud burbling noise when on. Kind of annoying, but not a dealbreaker.3. The compressor has steadily gotten louder and louder and is now *extremely* annoying. This is the reason for the 1-star review. About 4 months after we started using this kegerator, the compressor started to get a lot more noticeable when it clicks on. This is in an adjacent room from our living room, so it was a little annoying. Now it's really loud. You can hear it throughout the first floor of our house.Unless you're keeping this thing in a garage or basement, this unit is probably too loud. I'm looking into spending more money on a higher quality kegerator now."
4,Great Buy,"There should be no negative reviews for this product. Works great, easy install, and gets plenty cold. I ordered on a Monday and received an a Wednesday. Free shipping for something over 100lbs is awesome. I seen other kegoraters that run $500 - $1000 for the same damn thing. Not sure what they do that this one won't? This is definitely the one to get, can't beat the price. I didn't give if 5 stars because I do have 1 complaint. When the refrigerator turns on, it is a bit noisy. Most newer mini frigs are silence. This one does have a noticeable buzzing sound when it kick on."
2,Regulator doesn't work/Warm beer,"The regulator/gauges that come with it absolutely do not work at all. The default setting allowed for so much pressure to come off of the CO2 tank once I opened it, it shot out of the relief valve and would not stop. Once I turned down the red knob on the front, it sent CO2 to the keg without losing any. However, the gauges still do not work correctly. When it's all the way off, it reads ""20 pounds"". So I never truly know how much pressure is being applied. I'm not sure how much CO2/beer was wasted from having to GUESS where the gauges were at as I tweaked it. I had to order another regulator off of a keg website at a substantial cost that eliminated the ""savings"" I thought I was getting by purchasing this. Also, the beer isn't room temperature by any means but it could be a lot, lot colder. It's certainly not bar quality.It's better than not having a kegerator I suppose but I'm not thrilled with the performance so far."
4,For homebrew,"Converted this to a dual tap system for my homebrew with no problem, would not get cold enough so I added a small computer fan and was able to turn the thermostat down a few notches. Besides that Ive had no problems."
4,very nice kegerator,"I bought this kegerator for my husband as a Father's Day present after reading many reviews on many different kegerators. I decided to go with this one since it had the most reviews with more good than bad. It was shipped and arrived extremely fast and surprisingly my husband got it running even quicker. After reading all the reviews I though it would take him awhile to get it going, but he got it up and running in a couple hours. He is the ""handyman"" type though, and can pretty much put anything together. He actually read all the instructions and watched the you tube instructional video. He said he had to make a few minor tweaks. We didn't end up using the 2.5 lb co2 tank, instead a friend have us his extra 20lb tank which fits in there with a pony keg. So far so good. The beer is pouring good and cold. Its extremely quiet also, I have to check sometimes to make sure its still running because its so quiet. Overall I think this is one of the best appliance purchases I've made."
3,didn't work at all,"I received my kegorator and it was broken right out of the box. It never cooled down. I am impressed with Amazon.com though because they sent me another one without having to argue with them and they even shipped the new one overnight delivery for me. I hate that the first one was broken, but I have no hard feelings thanks to Amazon's incredible customer service. I love the kegorator! Looks great and I can't wait to get the new one that will hopefully work properly. Sounds crazy to write a review about a broken product and say nothing but good things, but that's how well they took care of me. Order with confidence!"
2,VERY POOR DESIGN,Very poor design. Why does it have a shelf in it. A 1/4 barrrel of coors light does not fit. I had so prop it up in the unit so it fits. So how is a 1/2 barrel going to fit. IT WILL NOT. So why advertise it can fit ALL kegs shapes and sizes. Why does no one answer the phone at the companies headquarters. Maybe AMAZON should really review items before they let false advertising go out. I been around and worked in bars all my life and this unit is really a waste of money. Save it and buy a name brand. As well I have to keep the pressure for the co2 at 20 pounds--WOW a minimun 6-10 pounds is the standard. Some of the screw holes to put the unit together dont match up. Again why a shelf which only holds the co2 tank. I am just going to keep it instead of repacking it and going through amazons and the companies return standards. So I quess I will buy 1/4 barrels from now on and what for name brand unit to go on sale and sell this thing.
2,overheated,"Recently purchased this item recieved on 3/8/12, been running for 5 days now, it is louder than my washing machine, only cools to 40 degrees, and compressor gets extremely hot, worried about it starting a fire! I could deal with the noise of this unit if it would cool my beverage. I guess you get what you pay for, I would not recommend this product."
5,Where Have You Been All My LIfe?,"I'm 17 years old and rarely find beauty books that TALk to me. I love Mr. Roppatte's book and I tried almost everything (which worked, incidentally). I also loved hearing the little gossipy stuff about the stars he ""does."" This is a wonderful and original beauty book--now, when I travel, I'll know how to change my hair!!!!! What fun!"
3,Useful for Someone Who Travels...,"Big City Look is somewhat limited in for those who don't live in or regularly visit any any of the big cities mentioned. However, it does give some interesting insights into social life here, there, and everywhere, making it a pleasant and informative read for someone who enjoys paging through fashion magazines."
1,Don't Enroll in Stripper Academy,"This is a terrible movie, neither sexy nor funny. They spent their entire $5 budget on a slick looking DVD cover. The star/writer/director (Vincent Foster) resembles the offspring of a union between Bruce Campbell and Will Farrell, but he has none of their wit and charm. The strippers have no moves or sex appeal, but considering they only have a stage as big as a kitchen table to work with - and a pole that occasionally shifts due to not being anchored in any way - you can't entirely blame them. To add to the complete lack of laughs or sensuality, constant recurring gags include a 400 pound flatulent female stripper and an inexplicable pair of male crossdressers. Don't get me wrong, I love dumb B-movies, but this is absolutely horrible. It couldn't arouse anyone if it came with free Viagra."
3,Funny,"In my personal opinion, I don't think that this movie would be the best, but it made me laugh. I know that there are better movies out there that you can pick from, but this one also acomplish it goal, to make you laugh. It has sexy, funny, and hot scenes."
5,Great inspiration,"Wonderful book! A must have for all artists and craftsmen, this book features colorful ornaments throughout history, covering most major periods and styles. As an artist I found it very inspiring and handy. All the designs are easily copied and can be reused in any project you choose. My own copy, which I own for a few years, still looks new and fresh thanks to the quality of the paper and printing. If you buy this book and find it useful, you can also get 'The grammar of ornament' by Owen Jones, which is very similar in concept, content and quality. However, Racinet's book is higher on my list."
1,"Yikes, what a film","I love Scifi.From reading Jules Verne from when I was 10 till today. I am a total scifi fan. I have read a lot of scifi, and I have seen most scifi films, but his one was.... beyond description.Imagine filming you family in your basement to make a scifi movie with cardboard sets.....Sorry, I could not sit and watch the whole thing. It was a huge disappointment."
4,Excellent!,I've been an Omen fan for quite awhile - I am pleased to have this Cd. I wasn't at all disappointed. I've listened to The Omen I and then this Cd so far. (I haven't listened to The Omen 3 as of yet) This one is my favorite of the two that I've listened to so far. I am very pleased.
5,Amazing.. works fast!,"This product came at the just the right time for my baby. You know how hard it is to watch your child in pain and nothing would soothe her. She didn't have colic by the traditional definitions, but she certainly was having a hard time with gas building in her stomach, no matter how much she was burped. She was born fairly little and so hard a very hard time digesting the formula (even Similac Sensitive and/or Soy). When we could find no other relief for her gas, I started looking online for more than the traditional Mylicon and found these. I have to admit that I was very skeptical at first, but this worked wonderfully. It was easy for her to dissolve on her naturally drooly tongue and after 2 doses, she was fast asleep with sweet relief. Now she has learned to push them out with her tongue, so I make sure to have some formula/water handy just to help wash it down and it will be all good. Besides, when she gets good sleep, I get better sleep, so it works for us both!"
3,When your baby is crying you'll want to try anything!,"Although I would not label my child as having colic, she did get fussy most evenings for the first couple of months after we brought her home. I bought this product, along with a tummy heating pad, along with gripe water and gave them all a try. I can't tell you if any of these products made a huge difference, where I was able to say YES! This product did it! But when you are a first time parent and your kid is uncomfortable you are willing to try anything, so I say, please go ahead and buy this item, it is not expensive, and it may help your baby. If anything, it will make you feel that at least you are trying to find a solution. Good luck!"
2,Too Much work no result,I bought this product based on the review and I have to say Gripe water is the best comparing to this. I mean come on you have to give your baby 2 pills every 15 minutes. give me a break! I don't have time and it didn't work after all that work. plus it's scary because it says it will dissolve but it's not as fast as you think. I have to add water and give it to the baby. plus the baby hates the taste.
5,Great for colicy children or fussy children,I am a first time mother and my son was very fussy at night. I had tried a number of thing that didn't work. I read a review for this product on another sight and figured I would try anything at this point. I love it! I give my son two tabs in his bottle right before bedtime and he sleeps soundly until his next feeding. This product is wonderful!
5,Relief from nightly colic,"This is the only thing that helps our 10 week old with her nightly colic. The colic started when she was 2 weeks old -every night for 2-3 hours begining around 7pm. She loves the Gripe Water but it doesn't help break up her tummy problems as well as the Colic Tablets. We start giving her 2 tablets disolved in about a tsp of water every 15 minutes starting at 6pm (1 hour before she usually starts her freak out). Then we give it to her as needed until she falls asleep -normally around 9:30pm. She still needs to help get the burps up -bouncing, burping, and the bicycle move helps. So far so good. I highly recommend this product. Wish we had tried it sooner! Check w/ your dr first."
4,helps sometimes,"The first time I used this, I wetted one tablet (I just don't feel comfortable sticking a pill in a two-week old's mouth, even if it says it dissolves instantly) to make it squishy and smeared it in his mouth...and he stopped crying instantly and fell fast asleep! It never worked THAT well again, but I do believe it helps- and it's worth a try. Can't hurt! I still use them sometimes when he's very gassy now that he's out of the colic age."
3,Can't really tell,"I can't really tell if it helps his gassiness but it does make my baby tired everytime I use it. So I use it mostly at night. However it does work for teething and it's great to travel with, no extra measuring cups or dropper."
2,Did not work for us,"I have purchased Gripe Water, And other products for our baby and her Colic issues and i never saw any improvements with that so i figure i would give this a shot. No noticeable difference at all with these Colic tabs. Normally i love Hylands products, but these did not work for us at all."
4,25 Things that Nurses Do to Self Destruct,"This is a very good book. I love Laura Gasparis Vonfrolio. She is very sharp, witty and in nurses face about the things that they do to belittle themselves and look less than professional to others and among themselves. This is a reality check for nurses. God knows that we need one. Every Nursing 101 student needs this book. I wish that Laura would revise and reprint this book."
3,Excellent read... BUT...,"I agree with a previous reviewer- it does list many obvious problems within the nursing profession, however, doesn't give many suggestions as to how one should deal with such problems.The facility I work for has a nasty reputation of ""nudging out"" those who don't fall into the company line, and have an open mind. Management is cliquish and those who aren't liked have their jobs made nigh-impossible so they decide to quit rather than reform a broken system- much like the situations described in the book. Gasparis and company take pride in pointing out the dysfunction of the nursing profession, but don't offer much in the way of fixing it, or how one keeps morale up when roadblocks and landmines muddle the field."
5,"I'm Spanish and before Amazon, I had to bring it from home","Well, the title says it all. I grew up eating this kind of tuna and here in the US, the tuna tastes very different. My wife (an American) could not understand why I insisted on home tuna until she had it. Now, there is no going back for her either. The flavor is rich and the meat is not just shreds. Enjoy..."
1,Really bad.,"We got a costume that is looking different to the offered one. The costume we got was a bad joke, very bad quality. Te only good thing to say, was the good communication with the selling company and the giving back. I chose not to get another one."
3,It Works,"I use this for barbell hip thrusts. It does the job and hasn't smooshed down or deformed at all. Nice nylon material, strong stitching.It does not stay closed over a standard-issue barbell. The velco is too weak, and the pad is a bit tight. It gets instantly pulled open when it makes contact with your body. But all you need to do is make sure the area with the pad closure is rotated away from where the bar contacts your body. It's a bit of a nuisance, but it was worth it to me to save money."
3,Too loose,"As the title says this thing is too loose on my 2"" 45# olympic bar. But I guess its better than a wrapped up towel or something."
3,doesn't fit all the way around the bar,"I use a very standard size bar, and the pad isn't wide enough to wrap all the way around the bar and close. It ends up being okay because I just put the ""open"" part opposite my shoulders. It is padded enough to be comfortable- just wish it fit!!"
5,Works better than a downy soaked towel...,"Alright I would moving up in weight with my squats, working with about 250lbs and really a towel was not cutting it anymore. I used to fold a towel up and lay it across my shoulders to keep the bar from digging in too much and at lower weights it worked fine. Once I got to around 180 or so it really started to lose the relief it used to give, at a little over 200 it was almost worse than doing it without any padding. So I was debating between the gel foam bad and the ""manta ray"" shoulder rack which cost quite a bit more. I went with this barbell pad and am really happy with my choice. As I stated I've had 250lbs on my shoulders with this pad and very little discomfort at all. For the money this is definately worth the price, I don't really know how much this pad can hold before it tears, but I'm hoping I never find out."
1,"Does not fit CAP brand Olympic sized bar, item misrepresented","This item does not fit CAP brand olympic sized bars. I have a CAP brand Olympic sized bar and it's not possible for this pad to connect, falls right off. Item description needs to be revised to indicate the brands this fits, obviously not intended for all Olympic bars."
3,Pussy pad,Back when i was in high school my coach would call these pussy pads and only allow the girls to use them. If u got balls man up and use ur shoulder meat.
2,Doesn't fit Olympic barbells,"We were very disappointed that although this pad was advertised as fitting both Olympic and standard barbells, it does not go fully around our Olympic barbell at all. We didn't have the time to return it, and instead are hoping that we can flatten it out a bit to make it go around properly. Otherwise, we'll give it to friends who have a standard barbell. The pad itself is very good quality."
3,A little small,Shipped quickly and product was as advertised. BARELY fits around my olympic bar and doesn't fit at all around the ever-so-slightly larger bar in my smith machine. I guess I wish it was 1-2cm bigger :(
2,Review From a Future Critic,"This book uses a used plot. So you know the story already, which is a disappointment if you were expecing something new.But nevertheless, it's a good book because it's about the Justice League, specificcally the Martian Manhunter (one of my two favorites: Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern)who has the powers of Martian Strength, Martian Vision (similar to Superman's heat vision), Telepathy (the ability to read minds), The power to phase (pass through solid objects) and morph (change his body to disguise himself as anyone or even a monster) If your a collector like I am it doesn't mean that you can get by without this book just because it's old material, though."
3,Big Pills,"This product seemed to works as planned, but the gel caps were awfully big to swallow, yet never got stuck like hard pills can."
5,Always Good,"Everything I have purchased from NOW has been a good. They do not have a lot of fillers, like many brands.I have not tried anything from them that I would not recommend.They are what they say they are."
4,Good product,It was a good price and the product appears to be working. I didn't have any issues but I do not have any side effects
3,nothing amazing happened to me,"i was hoping to see some benefit from these capsules. the capsules are well made and have no odor. they are slightly larger than most other capsules. they look very much like vitamin E capsules, only larger. but after taking a bottle-full of them, i have not seen any changes at all. so for me, borage oil does not seem to be helpful. your mileage may vary, and the only way to know for certain if a product will help you is to try it."
4,Definitely a worthwhile buy,"I concur in large part with the other reviewers: The women featured here are amazing (it doesn't get much better than former Penthouse Pet of the Year Jamie Lynn, and Jelena Jensen's ample bosom is must-see TV) and they reveal all of themselves to you. Rita G. is particularly hospitable.The format also is fun, as there is interactivity throughout. You, the viewer, are the bachelor, and you get to choose who you want to see and when. The game element also isn't at all difficult, so you won't become frustrated with it as is the case with some other interactive DVDs in my library.The only thing that keeps it from getting five stars for me is that there is some monotony to the vignettes. I'd like to have seen more camera angles and close-ups."
4,Sundman Spins Craft of Intrigue,"John Sundman takes fiction to a new level in this novel. Spinning his love for character development into the loom of conspiracy and the shadowy side of biotechnology, the result is a rich tapestry of intrigue and suspense. While not overly technical, John has done his homework here and the result is a novel that will leave you thinking long after you've put it down. In short, this may be the best novel you never heard of. It has all the classic elements of any good fiction story, but takes it to the next level with topical relevance and wit that will take you from a mirthful smirk to a jaw dropping ""wow!"" in a matter of pages. Anyone interested in what ""really"" happened in the Gulf War would do well to pick this book up."
3,Sundman tries very hard....,"Sundman's work suffers from overpacked details in every sentence to make it a smasher, cyber-thriller-techno-geek book. Be prepared for some tough slugging. Clue: the book is all about Sun's Jini and Java, and how Blue-Tooth will be used to invade our lives, enabling linking of biological-genetic data to electronic. It could happen. Sundman's namesake Bill Joy just warned us all. But it would make a good story without all the blood and bad Swiss-german in Sundman's The Acts of the Apostles."
3,okay book,"As far as techno-thrillers go, this book definitely deserves some praise:1) The author attempted to weave a complicated net with many characters all coming together at some point.2) The book's premise is interesting and somewhat credible (for a science fiction book that is).Now the criticism:1) Spelling and grammatic errors everywhere. I lost count of how many times he wrote ""therefor"" instead of ""therefore,"" for example.2) The ending looks like it was put together without much consideration and is unbelievably artificial. It looks as if Mr. Sundman originially intended to write a Greek tragedy, but one week before the deadline changed his mind to write a Hollywood happy-ending - hoping for a sequel and a movie perhaps? :-)"
3,Techno-geek thriller,"This is one of those books whose interesting ideas manage to overpower the sometime weak plotting and some occassional bad dialogue. That being said, I did enjoy it, and it is a page turner. I read all but the last 50 pages on a Saturday, and got up early on Sunday and finished the rest.The ideas: mix equal parts of nanotechnology, java, Bluetooth, ideas from alt.conspiracy, and biotech gene manipulation and stir.Plot weakness: Nick and Paul's relationship and their relationshiip to their common love object (seems to be some breast size obsession here).The jumping around from Silicon Valley to Switzerland...sometimes you weren't sure where you were.The part about AIDS being a government experiment gone arwy...yawn.Basically this book needed a better editor. I hoep Mr. Sundman's book is published by Random House (or some other transnational media corporation) who can afford to polish this diamond in the rough."
4,Techno thriller,"The opening chapter captured the thrill of software/hardware debugging. When a murder intruded on that opening I was captured. The author has a feel for the fast pace of the techno world and catches human emotions. The characters are developed, themes of evil and good are explored, flights of science fiction abound. Mostly though I enjoyed the interplay and tension around the brothers, the spouse and the chase. The book is well worth your time and investment."
5,Techno-thriller for the techno-illiterate.,"This book encompassed many of the advances, problems, and conspiracies within our advancing existance. The ever struggle between freedom and technology, portrayed by highly developed characters that come across so real that you can live in their wolrd. Sundman is obviously very wise when it comes to technology, but he puts the story in plain english so that you can follow even if operating a microwave is the extent of your mechanical inclination."
5,Amazing techno-thriller,"Technology is always moving at an ever faster pace. What seemed like science fiction just a few years ago, now is reality. Which makes this book not only an exciting read, but rather scary and disturbing as well.It is all too easy to see the events in Acts of the Apostles actually happening somewhere.The fast paced action keeps you riveted to the story and John Sundman makes the techno parts easy to follow and keep up with."
5,Exciting and absorbing,"I found Acts of the Apostles hard to put down once I started reading it. It was great fun, especially for a Bay Area resident, as the author does a nice job of capturing many of the issues surrounding the hi-tech world, its community and personalities. The author clearly has a strong personal understanding and passion for the characters and context of ""Acts of the Apostles"", and that depth comes out in the fast-paced, dreamlike qualities of the story as its various layers unfold."
5,Superb science fiction thriller,"Acts of the Apostles is abundant in its neuroscience and computer science, and even for a reader like me -- not greatly knowledgeable in either subject -- it was an engrossing read that I could only put down for naps. The narrative hurtles around the world at alarming speed, pausing at real places where I've drunk beer and at virtual places where I shopped for Walt Kelly collectibles, and every character is sharp-witted enough to keep up with each other, while the author stays one step ahead of the reader, compelling us to turn pages as fast as we can. It is the tensest type of thriller in that its foul plot might not be so foul if we think about it, and it is plausible enough so that we must."
4,scientifically accurate (mostly) nanotech thriller,"Ever hear of John Gilmore, Ken Olsen and Christine Peterson? ThenJohn Sundman's ""nanoscopically famous technoparanoid thriller"" is wellworth your attention. Acts is a plot-driven, well-paced novel thatstill manages to get most of its electrical engineering and biotechdetails right. Unlike Tom Clancy, Sundman features realisticwell-rounded characters (including many female ones) that you willstill be able to tell apart after a few hundred pages. The realism ofthe characters stems from the fact that they are almost all based onactual people, many of whom you may recognize if you've been hangingabout in Cambridge and Palo Alto for a few years. A portion of Actsis available on-line for free, but you should really be old-fashionedand buy the hardcopy. That way you'll be able to take the story withyou to the bathroom when you get to the exciting part."
2,Not for German Schuko it seems,"I thought ""UK/EU"" would include the Schuko design common throughout the EU and specifically Germany. I can fit Schuko on there, but it's not grounded in that case."
4,A reassuring book for 20 somethings,"This is the classic book on the subject, and for good reason. The author has done his research -- he is the defining figure on the subject -- and his insights and findings prove pretty accurate. As the typical, upper-middle class 20 something, it is valuable to read about the 20 something experience from multiple perspectives and backgrounds, including race, income, education. The reader will realize that despite society's tendency to segment the population into these stereotypical buckets, at the end of the day, we 20 somethings are all undergoing the same themes and challenges, at different paces and places moving toward our 30s and beyond. Strongly recommended."
3,Indulgent,Another excuse for teenage laziness. Arnett does not back up his argument strongly enough. Could be a stage that adults go in and out of multiple times over the life course rather than restricted to after adolescence.
3,Orange Sharpies,There were stickers on each pen that left a sticky mess on them once you removed them......That is all
4,1 less star because seem to dry out too fast,"Maybe it's all Sharpies? Don't seem to get a lot of use from each. Oh well. I'll keep looking for pen with bold, easy-read ink & fair price. Have seen some bio-degradeables. May try those next, especially clicker thingys. Hate losing tops...Good ($6.50/doz) price for Sharpies. Other colors slightly higher. Free SuperSaver shipping."
5,Long-lasting markers,I use sharpies in my work everyday. I am very pleased with the blue color as it is bold and the color seems to last longer than the other colored sharpies I have tried. Highly recommend these.
1,ORDERED A BOX OF 12 GR. SHARPIES GOT JUST 1,Do 60% of my shopping on line. This was one of the worst! Ordered 12 got 1 .
5,A Beautiful Collaboration,"Captivating songs, a seductively stylish soprano and an unobtrusive genius on piano. But what makes this recording so great is the collaboration. They each complement the other and the results are stunning. Karl Haas used ""All The Things You Are"" as an illustration of the collaborative art and deservedly so. Cudos to bassist David Finck too!"
3,Too Much Previn,"McNair has a magnificent, delicate voice. and her delivery is superb. She deserves a piano accompaniment that underlines her talent and, in short, plays second fiddle to her work. (I have in mind Barbara Cook backed up by Wally Harper. He's there but never gets in the way)Unfortunately, McNair goes head-to-head with Previn, a fine pianist who should stick to Chopin. His piano work is at times so ornate and overworked he all but drowns out McNair. Worse, the sound mix is even, that is, piano and voice at equal recording levels. Do I listen to her or him? I prefer her."
5,Beautiful and delicious- excellent gift for she who has it all.,"I bought this for my boyfriend's godmother. She is one of those impossibly stylish NY women who has everything she needs and is impossible to shop for. I thought getting her something consumable would be better than getting her some knick-knack to dust and take up space. She loved it! She said not only was it delicious, but she loves that it was beautiful and unusual. She has told me several times that she brings the tea out when serving company and it never fails to get a response. This is my new go-to for all the women in my life who already have it all, and for a few guys who are into botanicals and would appreciate it. I paired it with the glass teapot to make sure the full effect was gotten, and threw a box of biscuits in with it all. It's like giving someone a box of contemplative time, and I would (and will) do it again."
2,Not good unless you're in a class,"This is not a good intro engineering book unless you are using it in a high school class or something. It's not the type of book I wanted, maybe someone else might like it, but I found that it is not good for learning on your own and not good for reference either. I have a background in physics, so perhaps not the best for this stuff, nonetheless I feel like Wikipedia is better for learning some of this stuff."
2,Poorly written and annoying,"As with many books on this sort of subject, this book starts out with the assumption everyone reading it has had calculus or higher. Not necessarily a bad assumption, but it's a poor starting place (math heavy).Most books start out with talk about resistors, Ohm's law, KCL, etc etc. which I'm sure turns off many students to the subject. Instead they should get into the functional and literal uses for each component they will encounter, describing how it works, describing how the electrons would flow in each, etc. That kind of description is lost almost everywhere (and does not even appear in this book at all)."
4,Caulk Caps,"These red caulk caps are a GREAT thing to have and use. My only complaint with this order is the all-covering white label that was plastered over the entire package and this-referenced white label told me nothing. If I buy an item on Amazon, I expect it to be really close to the pictured item and really close to the manufacturers' original finished product. This wasn't. May be a petty complaint to some buyers but not to me. If I buy a shirt at Penney's, I don't expect it to have some label covering the Penney's label.I must say though, I am glad to have more of these caps."
5,GREAT Product!!,"I use these caps all the time, and they are amazing! They prevent the contents of the caulk tube from drying out, are easy to use, and are priced were you can throw them away after each use. It's not very often a product comes along that is better than you hoped it would be. This one definitely is!"
5,Very happy with my Little Red Nozzle Caps,"Great product, good for many uses. I would recommend this item to my friends. I just wish I had them years ago."
3,Smells like a saddle,"I've been wearing this for years. As an international professional stall-mucker, it's important that I don't scare the horses. This is of particular import when working in England. (Actually, when I'm over there they call it 'wourking', those crazy Brits.)Anyhow, I generally use a full bottle before wourking on a large barn. It sets the hourses at ease while I'm in their stalls with my shouvel and broum. The hourses get a whiff of me and think I'm a saddle. Makes it much easier to mount up, if you know what I mean.English Leather: It's kind of like Old Spice mixed with Brut, but more English-er. And Leathery."
5,Better of two collections of songs in Italian.,"'The Impatient Lover' sung by Cecilia Bartoli is a collection of 18th and 19th century songs in Italian which were written by the predominantly German composers, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, and Hayden. Oddly, this is very seriously a better, or at least a more enjoyable collection, to my ear, than the 'If you Love Me' collection of Italian songs written by Italians, including Scarlatti, Caldera, and Vivaldi. And, neither collection of Italian songs is as interesting as Mme. Bartoli's collection of French love songs, 'Chant D'Amore'. All are done on London, but with three different accompaniests. I think the French material is just better than the Italian."
1,GC Memory Card 1019 Corruption,Bought old Zelda game and tried to play but the Wii corrupted the card. Called Nintendo support who told me to mail the Wii in. No warranty: $70. Not worth it.
2,False Advertising,This card is listed as the Nintendo Gamecube 1019 Memory Card. Instead I received some off-brand knockoff.Do not buy memory cards from here if you want the real-deal.
1,I got cheated!,"My gamecube card was supposed to be 1,019 blocks, but all I got was 59. My seller cheated me, not sure if I will shop amazon again."
2,Love/Hate Memory Card,"I loved this memory card. I had all my information saved on it. This is now the reason I hate it. This memory card corrupted for me. I lost EVERYTHING for Gamecube as far as saved information goes. I am an extreme gamer, and the information lost was cumulative WEEKS of time of my life lost. The 1019 blocks is a lot and I would have 5-starred it until now. Now it gets 2 stars. It would have gotten one star if I didn't love it while it worked. The fact of the matter is: there are too many blocks in this memory card to provide stability. The more information you save on to it, the more like Jenga it becomes until it finally topples and corrupts. You would be better off buying four 251 block memory cards."
3,"It's a good card, but do NOT use it on the wii!","I've used this card for years and years, right up until the release of the Wii. Well yes this card is great! It has a lot of memory and it's great if you like to play sports games. However, there is a small error in the card its self.Like I said in the title, do NOT use this card in the Wii. Even though the Wii can read it, load saves from it, and even save, things will not work as they should. The card actually has a glitch in it which causes parts of it to become corrupt when being used in the Wii. There is no way to stop this from happening, and it WILL happen no matter what.As an ex Nsider member, and an active member of the new Nintendo Tech forums I've seen this happen a lot. It's a very common problem and the only thing you can do is just use it on the gamecube, and never put it in your Wii. If you only have a Wii, it's best to go with a few 250 block cards. If you're using the GCN, go for this one!"
1,"Large amount of space, but might not always work","This Gamecube Memory Card appears to have everything: Decent price, huge storage space, Nintendo branded. However, many people are having issues with the Nintendo Wii correctly reading it. That's not to say it doesn't work for everyone, I'm sure there are cases out there where it does. The internet seems filled with cases like mine, however. When you go to save a game on it, Gamecube games on the Wii do not recognize the card."
1,terrible memory card,"The memory card I got from here looked like it was very good. First, it was not packaged well. Second, it did not work on my video game. Last, I tried fixing it but it still did not work. So my dad is going to return it."
4,Gamecube memory stick,should have gotten a bigger one even though 1 gig is good! came very fast and price was very good!
4,Good card,Its expensive but holds a whopping 64 megabytes. That's more than all the third party cards and is the most reliable. Buy it for sports games.
4,Finally! The perfect card for your large Gamecube saves,"It's about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information. Before now, one had to rely off-brand cards (such as the Nyko 8 MB) for large saves, and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves. A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best. (Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted). Nintendo-brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability. If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games, this is perfect."
4,Beyond Memory,"It always seems to be what Nintendo finally did, other smaller companies did for Nintendo's Gamecube awhile ago. With Nintendo's Memory card 1019, it carries much more memory than it previous 251 memory block card. This device seems to be more crucial than imaginative, especially for die hard gamers of the Nintendo Gamecube. The memory works very well, and the trust that Nintendo carries on this card is great. Although with all different kinds of memory cards available for the Gamecube at all different prices, many will stick with cheaper memory cards that aren't always safe for Gamecube owners. Try to stick with Nintendo and this memory card, or the cheaper 251 block memory card. You really won't be sorry.Overall: B+Value: B"
1,Do Not Insert Into Your Wii!!!,"As far as using this memory card on your Gamecube it's great! When used on the Wii system it corrupts and you lose years of hard earned save data, I found out the hard way! Only use memory card 251 on your Wii. This memory card gets a 5 out of 5 rating when used on Gamecube but a negative 1 million rating when used on the Wii. Hope this helps someone to not have the same misfortune I had."
3,What is there to say,"What is there to say, its a memory ccard from Nintendo, you know what it does and what to expect i just wish they were bigger"
1,"Not Celia, Not a Princess","La India has gone on record several times as saying that she is the heir to the salsa throne, second only to Celia Cruz, better than any salsa singer now living. Here in Mexico, a very offensive promotional poster for a La India concert, held a very short time after the death of Celia, said something to the effect of, ""Now that the Queen is gone, La India is ready to fill her shoes.""A fellow musician once said, La India doesn't sing, she screams. I would put it like this: La India has little control over her voice and simply can not subtly phrase anything. Worse, her voice has no depth, no soul, nothing to latch onto. She's the unshining example of everything that's wrong with salsa and commercial Latin music in general today.Listen to her side by side with Omara Portuondo. Then consider La India's claim that La India is best.La India nos insulta el gusto no solo musical, sino moral. Un poco mas humilde y silenciosa por favor, chamaca."
5,Beautiful book!,"I have always been fascinated by Egypt and fairytales, so when I saw this book I had to get it for my collection. I'm very glad I did! The story is fun to read even for adults and the pictures are wonderfully drawn. The attention to detail is amazing! I fell in love with this book the moment I opened it, and I think you will too. I am now looking at getting some of the other multicultural Cinderella stories as well."
3,"Problematic, with potential","It is a racist story. It also minimizes slavery- framing the master as kind and generous. It promotes the Aryan ideal of a desirable princess- ""for her her eyes are as green as the Nile, her hair as feathery as papyrus and her skin the pink of a lotus flower"".It can be used to compare cultural perspectives- but analysis and criticism should include a look at the slavery issue, the race ideal and the the euro-American identity/perspective of the author.There are references to Egyptian geography, ancient mythology, social structure and cultural artifacts."
4,a great childrens book,this book is great if you have children. the story is not like the original cinderella but it is still a good book. ruth heller did a great job on the illustrations. if you have children you will want to buy this book.
3,good and bad,"The good news. ALlen was spectacular in her delivery of jokes. They rolled off her tongue as if she really believed it herself.It is said to be digitally remastered. The clarity is very good quality considering it is 1950. The sound, well that part they forgot to remaster, it has to be high to hear what they are saying sometimes.As for Burns, his lines were about half good jokes and the delivery of his was not that great. Good thing he was an excellent writer.For the bad news... this particular one, there are only two episodes. The third didn't make it on the disk and the first episode was copied twice. So the first and third episode are the same. Oh well, they are good anyway."
4,Hot!,"It was hot to watch. but, for some reason I liked it better the first time I saw it a few years ago!"
1,DISGRACEFUL!!!!,"This is disgraceful! I have not watched the video, but the cover has a GLARING and GRADE-LEVEL grammatical error. The PLURAL of puppy is PUPPIES (NOT PUPPY'S). Even my second-grader knows this. No matter how good the video, I would NEVER buy this!!!! If you are publishing videos for children, USE CORRECT GRAMMAR!"
3,IF they could have put two more songs on the other disc ...,"I bought this CD for basically two songs, the ""Merry Men"" song and the ""Welcome to Duloc"" song. They are both fun and in total about a minute and 30 seconds. They could easily fit on the first soundtrack CD. The instrumentals which are the other parts of the movie are ok to, but they work better when there is a picture to go with them :-).They could have also done the cuts better, for example Merry men cuts with Fiona's cry but she doesn't say ""That's so annoying!"" which would have been a better place to cut it.You're probably better off recording these of the original DVD."
2,more shrek not enough,The music that is played during the credits is great but can't seem to find it on any of the soundtracks. On this CD it says the end but that is not the music played while showing the credits.
4,Good but did not live up to expectations,"Well, after waiting for months, the Shrek score finally came out. While it's definitely a great listen, I was disappointed by the length of the cues. Most are less than two minutes and barely long enough to enjoy.Nevertheless, I am thoroughly enjoying my continued listening of the cd. The best track is #14: ""Escape From the Dragon."" It's a kind of rock/techno track with the main theme worked in."
3,Instrumental Series???,"This CD is something of a mixed bag. I liked Pete Rock's installment in this series, and someday I'm gonna get around to picking up Jazzy Jeff's. I like the musical aspects of this album but the vocals definitely leave something to be desired. Though Will.I.Am tries very hard to be avant-garde and something different than commercial West Coast rap, most of the vocal tracks still have that sound. He'll take a bangin' beat and throw simplistic, over-repetitive vocals on them, and so the results are not satisfying. The track with Madd Dogg is just plain awful. Most of the instrumental tracks are great, but my other main complaint about this CD is that many of the good instrumentals are very short, and end just when you're getting into them. This is a decent CD, but in my opinion it would have been much better if some of the vocal tracks were removed and the short instrumentals were expanded. Too much posturing and not enough creativity do not add up to a great album."
2,Could be a whole lot better....Nothing to Brag About,"This album only gets 2 stars for track number 2 & 3. Track number 2 ""Lay me Down"" with Terry Dexter will cause you to break your neck. The rest of the songs on this are filler, lackluster attempts at trying to be avant-garde."
4,REFRESHING,"I had a galley of ""When Chickenheads..."" and I absolutely loved it. I had to pull out my highlighter because Joan Morgan said the things that triggered reactions in me based on feelings I always had but never verbalized in regards to being a woman growing up in a generation of women where ""thugism"" is the new ""manhood"" and ""chickenheadism"" is the new ""wife of the manhood."" WHUH? Yeah, it's deep like that. I want to applaud Sister Morgan and the only reason I'm giving her 4 stars is because I WANTED MORE! I'm a new supporter."
4,Great disk - but one poor edit,"A magnificent cd. For those who find Te Kanawa a bit lifeless, this will change your view. It is a gracious performance.There is a small, but annoying technical flaw in the track of Sanctus - which ends as if it was clipped off prematurely to avoid a cough or someone dropping a music stand. First Philips Classical CD I have bought that has exhibited a technical flaw."
2,Poor quality.,"I ordered the Denali Two-Piece Lopper and Shear Set with Wood Handles.They arrived today.The handles of the shears are covered with some kind of plastic resin -- sort of like dried glue. It's impossible to get off. It doesn't make the shears unusable, but it is annoying.These are certainly cheap, but there's a reason. These are clearly quality control rejects. Still usable, but certainly not high quality."
1,2 Loppers,"I ordered this product thinking that I was going to get one shear and one lopper and I received two loppers, no shear. I have looked for a way to contact the seller/amazon about this and I have had no luck. The loppers dont look like bad quality, I just wish that it came with a shear. So if you are willing to take the chance on getting one or two loopers the choice is all yours."
4,Expresso Pens by Paper Mate(R),I do a lot of writing / drawing... and this pen suits both purposes very well.
4,Good action movie,"Great action movie. I think that the drama is really good, it keeps you in suspense all the time. I really recommend this movie.*Sponsored Post"
3,Solid Fare With an Atypical McQueen Performance,"This theatrical version of Ibsen's play ""An Enemy of the People"" is faithful to the Arthur Miller adaptation, and features a solid starring performance by Steve McQueen. Characteristic to McQueen, his Dr. Stockmann is underplayed but still convincing. Charles Durning is excellent as town mayor and Dr. Stockmann's elder brother. Only wrong note is Bibi Anderson's shrill Mrs. Stockmann (Dr. Stockmann's wife). Film has a claustrophobic feel, perhaps intentionally? On the expensive side but at least it is available on DVD. Recommended to Steve McQueen fans."
5,Excellent Research Source,"If you are researching the Civil War, especially the practice of medicine and surgery during the Civil War, this is an invaluable source. This is a personal journal of a Civil War surgeon. As such it is told in his own words. The reader is regaled with day to day details of the surgeon's life."
3,triple play,This product is attractive and serves it's purpose. The teak oil only lasted about 2 weeks and already needs to be re-oiled. Rubber anti-slip knobs that you can order seperately really don't help with the problem of sliding or slipping tiles.
3,they look nice but,"I bought a lot of these and laid them down to make a patio and they looked nice at first, but after 6 months in the sun they did not hold up at all. they warped and the plastic that holds them together all broke up. They are ok if you only want them for a summer look."
3,Krustonia,"This was an okay book, with nothing exceptional. Starting the book off with ""Krustonia"" was a big mistake, as it's easily the worst Simpsons comic ever. Once you start reading it, it gets boring, so take my advice, read everything else first, then come back to this one, since I lost enthusiasm after struggling to complete Krustonia for several days. That said, Homer's wresting days are really funny, the Smithers clones are strange, but somehow very entertaining. (Mr. Burns better watch out :) and Homer as Radioactive Man was great, especially to see Leon ""Michael Jackson"" Komposki back. I also liked the mini-Ned Flanders mystery, and the guide to comic book conventions. If it weren't for Krustonia, this book would be the perfect buy."
1,Didn't work,"Maybe since my kid doesn't understand what it is, the placebo affect didn't work, I don't know. But these aren't for us. I'll stick to half a melatonin."
5,Bayrisch oda woass,"I first heard Haindling when I was living in Germany looking for bands that sounded uniquely German. In this very diverse land, it turns out that the Bavarians are the ones who have really made an effort to preserve their traditions including music. Haidling is not really trad folk but his music has that as a big influence. He also includes pop, rock reggae, and other world music in his bag of tricks. Meuterei is a live album on which Haindling seems to be having a ball. The music is Bavarian and lots of other stuff but still manages to sound Bavarian. The songs are sung in the Bavarian dialect which even native German speakers find difficult to navigate. Nonetheless the music is enjoyable on its own. World music fans looking for a modern take on tradition who believe that Europe is also part of the world should check this out. Another excellent, more traditional and political band from Bavaria is Biermoesl Blosn."
4,Well-written,"This is a well-written novel, spreading out the clues, not so short you can read it in an afternoon, and not so long you're wondering why it isn't a series.According to previous reviews and the little I know independently, it accurately portrays the world of insurance and gene technology. HOWEVER, will authors _ever_ realize that when someone dies there is no ""reading of the will"" ?"
2,"Interesting plot, but no page turner.","The plot is believable and I think someday this could happen. But the plot to me took a long time to develop and the author didn't disclose enough clues early on to keep me interested. For example, I knew the Medan Diagnostics corporation was tied to the ProLif corporation The only link I had was through Michael Eliot. The other clues linking these two corporations together were too abstract to decipher so I was lost. I thought Alex was making leaps in logic by making sense out of these incoherent clues. The insurance policy envelops and the letter openers were big clues along with the printouts. However, there wasn't enough information disclosed by the author to link them together. I am not feeble minded and I like mystery novels, but this novel is only interesting toward the end because I wanted it to be over."
2,pretty awful until 2/3 through,"I guess it was worth it, to read thru this book. I stuck with it because, being employed in the health care field, I'm interested in insurance scams (the ones the insurnce companies themselves commit). The first half of the book was ""deadly"" (the writing and plot, not the murders) though it did pick up towards the end, with the switched data, ""accidents"", the envelope thing, etc. Still, not sure the book was worth it..."
5,Another excellent insurance scam thriller from Lynch,"I bought this book after reading Omega, and was pleased to find it better than the last novel by Patrick Lynch! I found it much harder to put this one down, and raced through to the finale which includes all the twists and turns that one could hope for. I have no hesitation in suggesting that those headed off on long journeys would like to while away the hours with this one. Insurance companies make an interesting target of attention, and in an age of cloning and disease profiling I would be surprised if what is written about is not already a fact."
1,dissapointing for $29.99,The DVD for a coaching resource is very short and the exercises not shown for long enough to support coaches in developing their inderstanding of what the pertinent points are. The DVD is very dated also so some of the the tactical elements are obselete.
2,hello i am a french student....,"hello, i am on my 3rd year of french(texas) i have to say that i have had the hardest time this year because of this text book. it lacks in grammer and i feel i dont learn very much. with the exception of cultural information...which is interesting, but i am interested in pursuing french as a possible career option, and i feel that this book is not preparing me for a future in fluent french speaking."
5,If you love Agnes...,"This is more of what I love most about this group.The music, the lyrics, the harmonies and the fun! A must have! I will next work on getting the solo works of these incredibly talented artists. On stage they have a vibrant energy combining their classical training, with humor,occasional political comment, and love."
2,Grobschnitt - 'Volle Molle' (Brain),"Unless you're an absolute Grobschnitt completist, you might want to pass on this disc altogether. I liked their 'Solar Music Live' effort so much better (see my review). 'Volle Molle' was first put out in 1980 and in my opinion, the record label SHOULD'VE kept it in the can. ""Snowflake"" is the only decent track on this CD, and the cut ""Coke-Train-Show"" is a poorly done TV commercial spoof. Not good at all. At least it didn't do much for me."
5,"From my childhood home, to my own home - 18yrs strong!","I still have a few of my Mr. Sketch markers 18 years later and they work! They're my favorite non-permanent markers. I highly recommend these because the tips are great to write with, the scents are fun to smell, the colors are brilliant, and the markers last! They've lasted me many years, around 18 years now. When I was a kid I used to smell these pens and the drawings I made with them. ;)Today I bought a set on Amazon for my friend's five year old son, he loves to draw and I think Mr. Sketch markers will be his favorites too."
3,not bad for what they were,not a bad item performed as expected dried up kind of quick though my son did use them a lot
1,Do not buy from this seller!,"This product was damaged upon receipt. The box (the actual box that the markers are in) is bent, ripped, and taped. There is also a missing cap from the black marker. This appears to be a very used set and sold as new. Gee thanks....this is a gift. Horribly disappointing."
2,Already drying out.,"I am disappointed with the product, because all the markers are drying out after one use. I guess they were old, maybe sitting on the shelf for too long before I bought them."
5,These Markers are AMAZING. I love Mr. Sketch.,"I have had my Mr. Sketch markers for four years and they still have not dried out. While I have lost some of the doubles to the colors like black... having used them heartily and not been easy on them for FOUR freaking years.. when they finally did begin to dry out I said ""I'm looking for that specific brand again"" by then Mr. Sketch had become like a friend to me. He has been with me through thick and thin and everything inbetween... he made most of my projects when I was a Junior in High school in California. I'll never forget the chocolate smelling snake I drew on poster board to review ""Bless Me Ultima"" Mr. Sketch's friendly face was there. These markers are FUN. They smell great. The case they come in is teal, a lovely sheeney teal. My favorite shade of teal in fact. They lasted for four years. I kid you not. These markers are worth much more than the asking price and I was tickled to find it on amazon.com. Buy Mr. Sketch! He is Mr. Awesome!"
5,through thick and thin,"I love these markers. I remember using them in elementary school, and am now once again using them in my teaching methods classes in my fifth year of University. They last forever and are something that both kids and adults can have fun with. If you have projects for either yourself or kids in your life that require markers, buy these! You won't regret it. :)"
3,very nice,"nice, but cut for a bust that isn't mine. I love this dress, and with some tailoring i think i can get it to look as good on me as it does on the dummy!"
4,markers,Great colors...the yellow and dark green were dried out when we got them...but my kids have enjoyed them with their art papers.
4,Good Price,I got this at a much better price than the office stationery stores. To my surprise they had included a couple extra markers in the back (new product promo or something like that).
2,What i get for being lazy,3 of the markers were dried out. but i really dont blame the company. i could've just gone to staples and got them myself. But for the ones that did work- long lasting vibrant colors. I usually dont expect less when it comes to sharpie
5,I LUV IT,I love this marker brand sharpie is the best and the color are amazing thanx sharpie and amazon for more great items:)
5,Colors!,Who doesn't know what a sharpie is? If your an artist then definitely snag a couple of these and create your own masterpiece!
3,Helpful?,"I agree with previous comments that the price for the CD is a bit high for what it has to offer. Additionally, a lot of the worksheets and lesson plans are very ""right there"" and don't offer a broad range for content expectations in my opinion. Additionally, there are not any grammar activities, which is what I am in need of most."
4,Best I found for To Kill a Mockingbird,"I don't understand the low ratings. The LitPlan contains 148 pages. Bound as a book that is a lot of pages for a literature plan! I literally searched for hours before deciding on this one. There are so many for this title available. The determining factor was the 3 essays assigned. For my 9th grade homeschooled son, that made the difference. Too many lesson plans and literature guides rely to heavily on vocabulary and chapter recaps. I didn't want that same old thing, it is boring!"
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,The product arrived within the time frame indicated. It was in excellent condition and packaged nicely :) Thank you!!
4,a mellower side of Serge,"Ok after all the talk these days of the legendary weirdness of Serge Gainsbourg it's nice to kick back and listen to this great little record... This is definatly Serge's most mellow and laid back offering... the sound is a very pleasant mixture of mellow guitars , electric pianos and simple (but funky) beats... over which the always sauve and soothing Serge drops his smooth lyrical flow. The band is the legendary crack Brittish Dewolfe studio group of Alan Hawkshaw and Alan Parker (who also worked on L'homme a Tette de Chou) so everything is impecably played and with the requisite amount of tweaked funkiness... just on a more mellow style... needless to say its still a very very satisfying and diggable spin..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BASED ON PHOTO! PRODUCT IS ONLY 2 INCHES BIG!!,"Wow. That's all I can say...I was in a hurry ordering Xmas presents on Amazon. My daughter was asking for Backyardigan toys and I saw the photo of this item and thought it would be perfect. Should have checked the specs on this item... Due to the price (almost $35.00) and the photo of item it looked like I was purchasing a large, pull around toy for my child. Ha! The toy is only 2 inches big!!! It shouldn't be listed for more than $5.00!!!!! Not kidding here! Just printed out my return labels for this item. My fault for not checking out the item better before I bought it & I believe it is the seller's fault for using such a large photo & charging so much! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS ITEM CAN FIT IN THE PALM OF MY HAND AND IT COST $35.00!"
2,Tiny Ship!,"Guess I didn't read carefully about the size of the pirate ship! It is actually very small. I'm ok with that, however, charging 29.99 for a metal ship seems a bit ridiculous. I bought these die cast toys when my son was a fan of Thomas the Tank Engine. We never paid that much for a train EVER!!! I will be returning the toy simply for the outrageous cost."
1,VERY small,"I wished they would have included dimensions. The picture was very deceiving and the ""take along vehicle"" is very misleading. The product is SO small, the size of a match box car. NOT worth the $15.77 I spent!"
1,Check prices elsewhere first,"I am so glad that you all included this reviews, I am big fun of amazon and can't understand why all the backyardigans toys are so overprices, most of the toys here are double the price that you will see in the stores retail prices.I also check the reatil price at fisher price and the prices listed here are just way out of hand.."
3,Backyardigans toy pirate ship,This is a very small toy which I bought as a sock present for my grandchild. I hope it won't break easily since it's so small. I hope it lasts awhile because it is cute. I didn't appreciate how small it is until I received it.
5,worth every penny,"easy to install. amazing sound, much better than the under saddle piezo that it replaced.its not cheap but it is one of those purchases that you wont regret"
4,Fishman Rare Earth Humbucking Shoudhole Pickup,Very pleased and it worked out fine for me. If you like what you play this will make a great addition.
5,"A rich, unusual delight","Since there are many classical music lovers who have yet to take the plunge with the many wonderful recordings of the Scarlatti harpsichord pieces, it could be doubly hard to lure them to this recording. But if you have been wanting depth in music from this period, and already know all the first drawer works by the big names in Baroque music, you need to hear this. These are absorbing, at times dark works with a kind of burnished elegance you would find most enticing. There are no distractions here. No drum thwacks, shrill reeds or blasting trumpets. Just a wonderful string orchestra (how could it be otherwise with this splendid group and conductor?)totally committed to the music. This is out-of-the way repertoire, but a treasure for discerning collectors. Very likely you will find you have made an astonishing new discovery."
1,These are NOT green,These pucks are NOT green. I received them and they were black. They said they do not even carry the green ones anymore.
5,Wonderful Ethnography on Hindustani Musicians,"This surely is a fascinating read. The thing that sets it apart from 'other books about Hindustani music' is (in plain English) that while most focus on the technicalities of the music itself, this book focuses more on the people MAKING the music. It explores relationships between the gurus and their students, details the complex issues that define becoming a musician both today and historically, and looks at the lives OF the musicians. Definitely a ""must-read"" for anyone (1) looking into studying North Indian music, (2) studying musicians across cultures, or (3) looking for more insight into another oft-ignored subset of Indian culture: the musicians themselves."
5,Topnotch in every aspect.,"Finally! An American choir that can rival the greats from Britain. This CD is amazing. Not only is the artistry and singing topnotch, the production values are impeccable. Plus, it's not the standard choral repertoire we've all grown bored with. I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who loves fine singing. I hope this is just one of many CDs to come."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED IT AFTER WAITING NEARLY A MONTH,"After writing two letters inquiring as to when I could expect to receive the CD, and receiving only one answer, I was notified by Amazon that this seller was no longer selling through Amazon. One star is even too much for the extremely disappointing response."
3,It starts well,"The book starts well, promissing a lot. However, it looses a lot of power after a few pages. You keep waiting characters to become more ""deep"" and ""complex"", but you end up with a soap opera - a good one, of course - but that lacks depth for a novel by Paul Auster."
3,Not Your Typical Auster,"This novel is certainly a departure for Paul Auster. Though I enjoyed it, it did not seem to measure up to the seriousness I expect from him. There were also moments when I felt he was giving me a cheap history lesson. However, having said that, it seems we readers should be a little tolerant of an author's experiments. I have read others of Auster's that err on the other side of caution--that is, ones that are serious but hard to decipher. I also took those to be experiments in bending forms."
1,Hidden Agenda,"Although written well, this is less about Brooklyn than it is about Austen's political agenda. How cowardly to hide behind fictional characters when spewing nonsense. I challenge Auster to write a non-fiction book about his views. Perhaps in the next book, he will disparage Jews or Muslims...but that is not as popular today. It's open season on Christians. Don't bother."
3,It was ok but...not a great read.,"This was my first Paul Auster novel. The cover notes had me intrigued. I was expecting a page turner and was eager to get sucked in to a great story of Philip Rothian proportions. Instead, I had to force myself to keep going. About 100 pages in I settled into the rhythm and although I never truly identified with any of the characters, it became a pleasant enough story.Nathan returns to Brooklyn not sure if he has survived cancer (he has). He reunites with his nephew Tom who works in a bookstore owned by Harry Brightman, a rather sinister, yet we are expected to believe, somewhat benevolent [...] character. Much of the story's twists and turns center around these guys. But there are many others who come and go, and come again.Read it on a plane, read it at the beach. Just don't read it expecting the next great American novel."
4,most accessible Auster novel,If you're looking for an Auster novel that plays with literary conventions then read The New York Trilogy. If you want a poignant rumination on fate and chance then read Moon Palace. If however you want to read something by a literary master on the beach then this book is perfect.
4,Slow to start but persevere,"At the beginning of the book I decided that I really wasn't going to like the main character. But it turns out that at the beginning of the book, the main character doesn't like himself. As the book progressed we both changed our opinions.This story was touching, funny and I found the narrative style clever and absorbing. The main character is writing a collection of his own 'follies'. Little snapshots of silly things he has done in his life. He doesn't share many of these with the reader but he does share the bigger follies of the people around him. In engrossing but sympathetic details.This book gives you plenty of sub plots, excellent characterisation and manges to tie it all into an uplifting story of humanity, it's flaws and it's beauties."
4,Dying with grace,"The randomness of the events in this novel threatens to pull apart the narrative thread of the story, but in the hands of Auster, they convey a realistic portrayal of one man who accidentally finds redemption in the renewal of bonds with members of his extended family.All Nathan Glass wanted was to die quietly in his old childhood neighborhood in Brooklyn, but instead he finds new life when he reaches out to care for other people and their sufferings."
3,Good Read,"This is not a book I would keep in my library, but it is an enjoyable book to read. The writing style is comfortable, the story line is mainstream and the messages are timeless. Very worthwhile."
5,Serendipitous Read!,"Not expecting what I found in this delightful bookhaving read previous works of Auster (dark and mysterious),this was a splendid holiday read! Wonderful character development,examples of personal triumphs and redemption - treatyourself to this most enjoyable book."
3,Feel good novel which isn't very good,"This is just not a very well written book, certainly not of the caliber you would expect from an author like Auster. It is not that it is dull. It is just that Auster's main purpose is to make a feel good story, and rather than do this through good writing, he accomplishes it by plot and by populating the novel with characters very obviously designed primarily to be likeable.I think Auster did make credible the marriage of Tom's sister, providing insight into such unequal relationships. I much enjoyed the literary conversations between Tom and Nathan. On the other hand, I was confused by the totally different way Nathan characterizes his marriage and his ex-wife on p.3 (cared for her, divorce wasn't his idea) and p. 235 (marriage all went bad, wanted to kill her at times, etc.). Yes people change their views, and Edith was nasty in a phone call, but I think both characterizations were what were convenient at the time."
2,"Pleasant read, but way too sugary","This book is a nice read; I read it in one day. My only problem with it is that it is very ""sugary""; the last quater of the book is basically devoted to the happy end."
2,Follies Disappoint,"I agree with the N.Y. Times reviewer who said this book was amateurish. I felt that every part of it was in a book I had read before. The originality factor just wasn't there! I did, however enjoy the references to Brooklyn and its inhabitants. Those really rang true!"
4,Detrás de la cortina,"El libro no cuenta nada del otro mundo. Todo es cotidiano y hasta casi aburrido. No obstante, las pequeñas cosas que suceden terminan por conformar un pequeño universo de relaciones en las cuales dicho sea de paso tampoco se profundiza demasiado. No sé cómo... pero la novela termina por funcionar. Es como si Paul Auster, te invitara a meterte detrás de la cortina y observar lo que le pasa a ese personaje. Me gustó bastante y recomiendo su lectura."
3,Very confusing.,"After having heard so much about Mr. Auster's novels, I finally got around to reading one. And as much as I'd like to agree with some of the other reviewers here as to the stellar qualities of ''The Brooklyn Follies', I can't.The novel is narrated in the first-person. This is a partial explanation as to why it comes across as...well...the efforts of a not-very-good writer. At least in the delivery. The narrator's 'true voice'. But it doesn't account for the fact that much of the dialogue is horrible (in fact, unbelievable), and that many of the story aspects are simply laughable.Hence, my confusion; this is the work of one of America's best writers.As I completed the book, I was trying to imagine how this story could have been told so that justice would have been done to the various plotlines and characters. But my confusion was a little too overwhelming, so I wasn't able to see a way where this might have been possible.I've given it three stars, but I still wouldn't recommend it."
1,I get more excited reading the Times editorial page...,"After enjoying Auster's quirky and moderately satisfying Oracle Night, I was looking forward to The Brooklyn Follies. The novel has a promising beginning with interesting characters and the hint of a good story. But a little beyond the halfway point it begins to degenerate into a prototypical liberal rant against George Bush (and all other hated republicans), and that naturally flows into, of course, a condemnation of the religious reactionaries who populate the southern half of the country. If Auster had expressed his political positions in a fresh, interesting approach I may have been more receptive to them, but to rehash worn cliches really makes me question his intellectual integrity."
2,An unsatisfying read,"The characters are basically boring people just muddling, and not very successfully, through life. I found it hard to get into this book. The writing is excellent, but the story was neither captivating nor exciting."
2,Some things don't go together,"I love 70's music and I love this type of instrumentals... but not together! Just does not sound right. In my opinion, this instrumentation should be for ""bluegrass, old-timey"" tunes."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"After hearing what a dud this was for years, I never bothered to buy the original recording. But after buying this newer version I was surprised how much I liked this! While it doesnt rank as the best of Rodgers or Sondheim, its much better than I was expecting. I even went ahead and bought the original cast recording after buying this one. If I had to choose, I would recommend this one as the better choice. It has an overture, the original lyrics to Its Gonna Be Allright and the song Everybody Loves Leona which isnt in the original. The lead ins and voice overs also help to establish character. But if you can swing it, get the original cast too (its cheap!) for Elizabeth Allen and Sergio Franchi"
5,Considerably better than it's reputation!,"To me, Sondheim's occationally cynical lyrics are just what is needed to bring the somewhat lighthearted sound of Rodgers tunes down to earth. The result is a strong and fascinating contrast between the elements of the musical, which is absolutely right for this ambivalent piece of theatre.In DIHAW one may recognise themes and issues explored in other, all-Sondheim musicals like Anyone Can Whistle, Company and A Little Night Music."
1,Tepid...,"""Made to be Broken"" and ""While Your Were Out"" were great hillbilly post-punk...loud and sweet and crunchy. Their shows were all hair, sweat and volume. I saw em open for Husker Du on the ""Made to be Broken"" tour and, much as I love Husker Du, they swept the floor with em. ""Hang Time"" and ""...and the Horse They Rode In On"" had enough amphetamine Cheap Trick moments to make em keepers, and even ""Grave Dancer's Union"", slick as it was, had some great tunes.Look, I'd love to love 2006 Soul Asylum. Dave Pirner's ""Faces and Names"" was a great disk. I like Golden Smog. Heck, I even bought and enjoyed the live Soul Asylum album. But the fact is...I can't be a Soul Asylum apologist anymore. The new Bon Jovi album has more fire and less cliche than ""The Silver Lining"". I really did want to like it..."
2,"Strong start, but...","""Stand Up and Be Strong"" is a really good pop song. I also liked the next three tracks, ""Lately,"" ""Crazy Mixed Up World,"" and All is Well."" However, the rest of the disc was pretty weak, with several songs actually being tough to listen to all the way through."
5,This album is soooo Soul Asylum!!,"Instead of writing a ""book"" like the last person, I will just say that I love the CD and this album means alot to the guys of Soul Asylum. They recorded it with there ever so talented bassist Karl before he passed away. If you do not like this album, you know nothing about Soul Asylum. One can ramble on and nit pick every song, but give me a break...Relax and enjoy the music. I recently saw them live and as always they are a great live band. I loved their new material and couldn't wait to get the album. I highly recommend it to all ""real"" Soul Asylum fans and all those music lovers who actually have a clue!!(and a life!!)"
4,Disappointed,The clock must not be made very well. My wife was trying to set it so it would chime the correct hour and couldn't get it set right following the instructions. She kept trying until the chimming mechanism busted so we have a clock with a swinging pendulum but no chime.
5,Golf: The Mind Game,Great book even if you don't play golf. I bought it for my son and now I am enjoying it
1,Doesn't sound like Merle Haggard.,"If you're thinking about buying this CD, look it up on Amazon and listen to the samples of the songs. No one who listens to the songs first will buy the CD. ""Okie from Muskogee"" is the title, the songs listed were Merle's hits, and Merle's picture is on it. All of that is deceiving! Nothing printed on the CD indicates that it's anything except Merle singing some of his best songs; however, the voice doesn't sound like Merle Haggard, and none of the songs are sung with the right tune. I bought it on eBay at a low price, but it's not worth even the few dollars I paid for it. I should have listened to it on Amazon. This CD doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it, but that's the lowest it's possible to rate it."
4,Good price for the product,shopping at the local staples store showed the same product for triple the price. glad i checked amazon. great price for good product
4,A look at first contact from the other side,"This is a very creative first contact story. Told from the alien point-of-view, it illustrates the dangers that prejudice and fear create when alien species first meet.Foster does a good job of describing a insectoid civilization, and provides great insight into the traits of such a species. It is especially interesting to note the relative relationship of mammals on this world, and the attitudes towards them. This sets the stage for the potential conflict when contact with Earth's humans.This book holds a mirror up to our own prejudices and attitudes and serves as a cautionary tale about making quick judgements when encountering new cultures. It is all too easy for misunderstandings to create enemies, when patience might lead to understanding and friendship."
4,Nicely done first contact novel.,"A very nice science fiction novel which explores first contact between two very different alien races and does it from the point of view of both species. The novel is compact and efficient, managing to capture the major political reactions without needing to make them overly byzantine or complex. Conspicuous villains are not on offer. Rather, Foster tackles the origins of prejudice and offers a possible model of moving forward. The book points out that contact between unlike peoples can also offer important opportunities for change within both affected cultures.The resolution, like the rest of the book, is very gentle. At this point in science fiction and world history it may feel slightly dated or overly hopeful. On the other hand, perhaps a healthy dose of resolvable conflict is a welcome and necessary thing. You decide."
3,"Good history lesson, bad story","Nor Crystal Tears is a prequel to the extensive Humanx Commonwealth books by Foster. Tears chronicles the first meeting between human and Thranx, as it follows the exploits of an odd Thranx named Ryo. The first half is kinda dull, there is not anything too interesting about the Thranx, actually. The second half, after the humans are introduced (captured really), is marginally better, although a bit inconsistent and far-fetched. Actually, it is pretty easy to believe the alien settings, physiology and even psychology, but the humans were downright unbelievable. A childish (literally) little aside about how wonderful American Indians were and how evil ""Cowboys"" were, was a bit too much to stomach also."
1,"No TAB, not an instructional DVD",There's no TAB book with this DVD.The camera angles are not good enough to see what BB is playing.This is not a Instructional DVD.It's just an interview with BB playing a few licks.Don't waste your money.
5,Best inexpensive Jumprope on the Market,"Let's put it this way. I am a decent jumprope practitioner. I can go for probably 5 minutes super fast, 10 minutes at a nice pace.I can perform the occasional crossover.Well, with this rope? I can immediately perform crossover after crossover etc, etc, etc, as easy as turning the rope normally.If I wear this one out completely, next time I may go for Buddy Lee's own upgrades in one of these:[...]But for now, this magic rope destroys every fabric, beaded or leather rope I have ever used, and I love it. I am sure to get better and better than ever, with the Buddy Lee Magic Rope."
1,Don't buy this product if you want it for more than one day,"I ordered this product on April 23rd. My first thought when I opened the package was that this jump rope looked cheaply made. I gave it to my 11 year old daughter on April 25th and the actual plastic rope portion broke her first time using it. She was jumping with it on the driveway one minute, the next minute, she was asking for duct tape. She wasn't mishandling it, or using it for anything other than its intented purpose. I am highly disappointed, a waste of money. I will not be getting this brand again."
3,Has shortcomings.,"The main drawback with this player is that the beginning of each song is cut off by an annoying fade-in effect. Also, the buttons are too easily pressed. Everything else seems to work."
3,A disappointment,"The promise of wackiness just doesn't materialize. Instead of genuine weirdness, as one expects and gets from, say, Jamie Saft, or the A. D. D. Trio, or the Claudia Quintet, or even Hollywood Diaspora, what we've got here is souped-up Klezmer with vague metal overlays. I don't know. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood.But I don't think so. Just as you can't conjure res, you can't conjure weirdness. You just gotta have that weird mojo thang happenin', an' if you aint, you nowhere."
4,Good CD,"Haven't listened to this CD for ten years since it was lost while traveling. Brings back memories. Very much like this disk. Yes, I would recommend it."
1,Poor coordination,It was very difficult to follow along in the book while listening to the CDs. The activities often times did not match what was shown in the book at all. This was very frustrating! The book could have done a much better job at explaining what you were hearing on the CD.
4,Mozart is great!,"Mozart is surely one of the greatest composers ever, and the performances of his works were well done. I plan to get some more of his works in the future, but I will pay more attention as to who is performing the work."
