5,Love it,"GREAT grater. Sharp, well designed for easy use, easy to clean. And did I mention SHARP? I accidentally added a slice of protein to the potatoes I was grating the other day."
5,"This totally shreds, bro",The professional extra coarse grater is just as sharp as their original series of graters. The rasp is a bit rounded on this particular coarseness/model but it's still easy to clean without shredding a sponge. I'm hoping the metal frame holds up better than the plastic ones from the not professional series did; I had a couple of those crack over a three year period. I will try to update if this one does/does not break. Have had for 1mo so far and working great!
3,Conspire for a while,"OK, we've heard from the people who love Yes and will give this a chance, and the people who love 90125, and the prog rock elite who believe only an album that sells less than 100 copies has any artistic integrity, but let's let Chris and Billy do the talking. The best part is that we get to hear Chris Squire singing lead for the first time in 20 years! The lyrics are not awe inspiring but they are positive and uplifting. These guys are not afraid to make a catchy song, and so what? Granted, like most true Yes fans, I don't feel the need for pop hits, but remember, if Yes hadn't been somewhat catchy, none of us would have listened. This is basically an album for fans of Squire and Sherwood and the distinctive sound they create whenever they make music together. Thank goodness it is different, thank goodness it goes in a new direction. It is a breath of fresh air."
1,There's just no excuse for this,"I will not listen to this record a second time. It was hard enough getting through it once. I am a longtime fan of Chris and classic Yes, and considering that both Chris and Billy were in such fine form on the recent Ladder tour, I cannot begin to fathom how two guys so talented could produce this drivel. La-la pop at it's least compelling. C'mon, guys, you can do better, and your fans deserve a little substance for their ( ). Let's hope the momentum from The Ladder (Excellent!) is not dissipated by this disappointment."
2,Fish out of time,"If you were expecting FOOW II - think again! This one's got guitar on it - great gobs of it. In fact, it sounds like mid-eighties corporate rock. To be fair, that's probably when much of it was conceived since this has been on the shelf for years. On the plus side, its got Chris' distinctive vocals on a few of the tracks. Steve Stevens puts in some tasty guitar on one energetic track (at time sounding like Howe and Holdsworth). Overall though, it doesn't come close to FOOW. That trio format was in many ways quite audacious but this suffers from Billy Sherwood's dated and insipid musical view. Is there much bass on it? No more than standard rock fayre. Gone are the triumphant bass pirouettes of 'Hold out your hand'. Chris, if you're going to abandon one of the most distinctive bass styles in music and leech of a youngster, pick a credible one next time."
4,This ladder climbs higher,"Add a little bit of Rabin and you've got the best Yes album since 90125. You can notice it if you listen to the Yesyears version of ""Love Conquers All"". Steve Howe... sorry I really don't miss you at all. You can keep playing The Clap forever... Way to go Billy & Dr. Chris!"
4,Great Prog Rock,"O.k. I usually don't chime in on a review unless I disagree strongly with peoples' opinions, But . . . . .Granted, it's hard not to compare any Yes related project to Yes. The songs and performances are really strong here. Does it sound more like 80s or 90s era prog than 70s yes. That said, if you liked Tormato era Squire and 90125 era keyboard sounds then you'll like this. Unexpected nice vocal harmony layering, unexpected good guitar work. This is among the strongest Yes side projects to come alone in a long time."
4,3 SUPERB songs and some so-so's,"Billy and Chris are a great performing team. They do just OK at songwriting together. So, what do you say? Hmmm. Get Chris Squire's ""Fish Out Of Water"", Billy's ""The Big Peace"", and YES's ""The Ladder"" to see what I mean. Great individual songwriters and great performers together in YES.But this album is just alright. They have written some great stuff together, but it's mostly been with other members of YES and ended up on YES albums. The first 3 songs on this album, though, are SUPERB:1. Days Of Wonder - powerhouse2. Light In My Life - just a cool, funky love song. Great vocals3. Violet Purple Rose - Billy's lyrics here are probably in the top 5 best ever lyrics by anyone in any era. (Oh, and Chris's bass line is one of the best bass riffs you'll ever hear, too)So, I would recommend this album just for those 3 songs and then you might find your own favorites amongst the others."
2,quite outdated,"OK intro for technical readers, but there is a lot here that is completely out of date since the book was written in 1997. Lots of new and revised standards have been published since then."
2,The book is full of explaination about headers,"The book really lacks in illustrative examples. An endless list of headers & explaination for the same is given. As the old adage goes ""A picture is worth a 1000 words"", I really could not find a single proper example, nor a comparitive example relating it to IPv4."
4,Please buy direct and get the same thing,"This is a nice collection of songs that don't need to be imported from Japan to enjoy. Just go to www.benfolds.com and you'll be able to get the goods at a fraction of this cost. It is nice that Amazon allows us to purchase imports, but this time it isn't a necessity."
3,CAT 6 Patch Cable,It's a cable & it works. Nicely molded connector and secure latch clip. Well made and a good value. What else to say?
5,Eminently helpful,"This is one of the best books I've ever read on hypertension. Dr. Mann's style is gentle and knowing, and he makes the concepts easy to understand. And whether your high blood pressure is linked to your repressing your emotions or not, the latter part of the book offers an excellent overview of treatment options."
5,Effective and gentle,"I bought this curry comb as part of the oster 7-piece package. It works really well for getting mud and fine dirt out of coats. I like it because I don't need to use a lot of force to get good results (pressing very gently and going in a circular pattern brings up just as much dirt as a traditional rubber curry), making it great for thin-skinned horses. Provides a nice massage too."
3,A little too rough,"Well, I have not really used this one alot because it seems a bit too rough for my gelding. The times I have tried using it he has not like it much. I have to be very careful to not press down at all as I curry his back. He will usually ""squinch"" his back and move away from me if it starts to become painful. I think it would have been better to make it a bit softer."
4,A very enjoyable Colonial Era Movie,"This is an enjoyable movie about American colonial exploration before the Revolutionary War. About a group of explorers and colonial pioneers in the service of King George II of England making their presence known in French and Indian territory around the upper regions of present day New England.Although made in 1940, this is a movie that has great settings and technicolor as well as a good plot. Spencer Tracy does an excellent job as the leader of these Rangers and Robert Young is suprisingly effective as an observer/artist who goes along this expedition. It does get a tad bit long at times but overall it is a very interesting and enjoyable movie."
4,A great adventure film--one of the finest in this genre..,A splendid adventure film shot in beautiful color and on location. Spencer Tracy never had a better role as the dauntless Major Rogers who brings his rangers home after long peril-laden trek through the wilderness after their boats had been destroyed. They had previously and successfully destroyed an indian village. The indians in this film are shown to be cruel and blood-thirsty and this may offend devotees of political correctness but nevertheless the film is very realistic. The film never does deal with the northwest passage and one could only hope that they would have made a sequel as stirring and as exciting as this one.
3,"It's OK, but....","I expected the film to be historicially correct, and perhaps it was but many of the actors over played their rolls.I know, it is an old film and thats how some actors did it back then."
4,survival book !,Ill make short and sweet. The book has alot of new things i did not now. And some that i would never use. But if your into survival you could pick up a thing or two from this book. Overall good book fast delivery
2,Less useful than I thought,"Ultimately, this wasn't the reference guide its' advertised as. While it's fun to read and think about, most people who want to learn more about wilderness survival would probably be better served by other resources."
3,The Ultimate Survival Guide,"The Ultimate Survival Guide is a useful, inexpensive, compact cargo size pocket book that contains a great deal of useful survival information.This is a handy guide to carry if you are camping, hiking, hunting, or fishing. This is also a handy guide for someone in the military.I would assume that many of the tips and instructions probably won't be needed for the average reader, but it is good to know info just in case.I recommend purchasing this item."
5,An Important Tool in Treating The Post-Abortion Syndrome,"A vary important modality in treating Post- Abortion Syndrome, a devastating result to millions of women who have had an abortion, is intense prayer. Not only Roman and Eastern Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as other Christians pray this very special Rosary for all who are involved in an abortion. This meditation, though intensely spiritual, is easily prayed and covers well all who suffer from this horrible situation. It gives an assurance that God will forgive and forget the abortion and welcome the penitent back into the state of His grace."
4,a good tradeoff,"As promised, they work better with magnetic pickups than traditional acoustic strings. Unamplified, they lack the warmth and volume of traditional acoustic strings, but they sound better unamplified than GHS White Bronze (another great acoustic/electric string), though the White bronze sounds even better with a pickup than the Zebras do. So, there's a tradeoff. The better the suited the string is for a magnetic pickup, the more its unamplified sound is sacrificed. The Zebras find a pretty good middle-ground."
3,Not a big hit-yet.,"We purchased this for our son, but it is a little big frustrating for him. It hinges in the center making it nearly impossible to push along, which is what he loves to do with trucks. I think the time will come though when he will use it in the dirt and manipulate it the way it is intended. Just be aware that if your little guy likes to push trucks, this one does not work like that. It takes a bit of coordination, but I am confident that this will be a hit in the future."
5,"""Mighty"" ? It's not.......!",My 3 yr old grand-daughter got this truck for Christmas. Within the first 2 weeks the plastic loader was always falling off due the childs tendency to pick up this heavy toy by grabbing the loader. She still plays with it minus the loader part. Unfortunatly they(TONKA) has a design problem to fix.
2,Too Much Plastic Too little metal,The front loader has too much plastic on it. 10 years ago it would have been made mainly of metal and very little plastic used. Of course today it is all about maximizing profits at the sake of durability. Steer Clear. There are still products like this made from metal on the market and I would rather pay a little extra for the quality. Obviously Tonka has lost touch with its customer base.
5,Tonka Toys are Tough!,"This is a GREAT toy for a rough little boy which is exactly what we have here! My son received this for Christmas a year ago & it still looks great & works great! That is saying lots!! He can destroy a lot of toys quickly b/c he is all boy!! For example, he received a truck for his birthday a month ago which was supposed to be a good rugged truck well it has been pronounced dead & retired to the trash already after just a month, but not his Tonka toys! But then we always buy the metal ones for him! I dont think you can go wrong with this toy! We are actly buying him a few more in this same line for this Christmas b/c they are so rugged!"
2,Tonka - Not as good as it used to be.,"Cheap plastic paired with super thin sheet metal. But quite simply, the worst part of this toy is the plastic hinge used for the bucket lever. It was broken within a day, rendering the entire toy quite useless. Even prior to breaking, the bucket wouldn't stay elevated even under it's own weight. I can't imagine what a full load of dirt would do.I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone, period."
4,Just like the good old days,"I used to have these when I was a child, and they are still as fun, and durable as they were 18 years ago.My son hs all the medal trucks, and plays for hours on end. In the house we use beans to pick up and use instead of gravels. I cannot say enough, and with the lifetime warrenty,who cares if it falls down the steps. Only complaint is if left out in rain, it may rust."
3,Did not like plastic,"Controls for the front bucket are plastic, not sure how long they will last with my 3 year old grandson?"
2,Mighty Tonka - Buyer BEWARE,"I purchased this vehicle for my 2/year old grandson. After investing in the Might Tonka dump truck I foolishly assumed this toy would be of equal durability and value - especially in light of the investment of over $50. It arrived in a crushed box, NOT in original packaging, and without an original receipt. A photocopy of a 'lifetime guarantee' was tossed inside the box and the loader was sliding around along with some crumpled paper. The wheels are plastic, the decals are crooked and wrinkled, and I do not feel this at all lives up to the TONKA reputation. I am terribly disappointed and will NEVER buy this type of toy on line again as it is NOT at all what I expected. Buyer BEWARE !!!"
3,A little disappointed,"I was under the assumption that this was a sturdy metal truck - it is not all metal. It seems to be pretty sturdy but I notice that when my son leans on the loader handle move the truck around he has to be mindful of his balance - the truck tips over easily when moving it from this angle. The scoop and handles are all plastic, but the bucket, arm, and body/frame are all made of metal. The wheels are plastic too, not rubber like I had imagined. If you are looking for one of those 'good ole' metal Tonka trucks - then you might be disappointed with Tonka's newer version of this classic toy. They just don't make them like they used to! :( Good news - my son (4 yrs old) does not seem to care - he has been loading and dumping legos and Matchbox cars since Christmas."
2,what?,"There has already been alot of discussion about J5 going mainstream with Dave Matthews Band on ""Work it Out"", but thats not the worst song on the CD. ""Brown Girl"" plain sucks. ""Baby Please"" is not far behind. Besides that most of the beats are a step down (""Radio"" would be a major example of this). Basically, it does have some decent songs but they are a step down from the average Jurassic 5 song. On the other hand, ""Canto De Ossanha"" is a pretty good instrumental. Other than that though this CD feels like a big letdown from the previous CD's which were so great."
2,No New Tricks,"I am a huge a Jurassic 5 fan, in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why I started to like hip hop. On this album nothing catches your attention. The use the same formula that they have used in the past, but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced. A lot of that has to do with Cut Chemist not being there. Nu-Mark is a good producer, but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference. ""Back 4 you"" and ""Red Hot"" are really the only two good songs on the album. There are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head. Also the song with Dave Matthews Band is AWFUL, but J5 wanted to try something new, and I think that is an interesting artistic decision, it just does not work very well between these two styles. This is by far the worst J5 album, if you want classic J5 pick up Quality Control, or their EP, each of these are defining hip hop."
4,Damn good,"Call me old, call me female, but I can dismiss that in-your-face rap with a quickness. When I stumbled across Jurassic 5 on a rock station and then the next day the cd playing at a photography studio, I had to pay 'em some mind. They're good in that laid-back I-ain't-got-to-preach-at-'cha kinda way. While working I listened to Feedback in its entirety. I loved it. If they're searching for new fans by doing a mainstream crossover (as some previous reviews have accused them of), they've found a fan in me. I understand the cache of being scarse and keeping true to what it is you are...but break a sistah off some and make the good rap palpable to me too."
3,J5- Feedback,"First off, this is a review written from a fan of J5, a big fan. They are my favorite rap group, and i am seeing them in concert, but this album was a bit of a disappointment. No single track really stands out as being AMAZING. My favorite was Red Hot, but that may not even be in my top 10 for them. Power in numbers was beyond fantastic, not a bad song so when I purchased this i had large expectatations, after all they had 5 years to do it. but i was let down. I would still purchase it, but dont expect a classic....sorry"
2,Sounds like j5 with safety gear,"Now...This record seems to have the shell of what j5 is about without the core. I have allways wished for these guys to make a definitive statement. To actually create the lyrical atmosphere they wish for. Instead they just complain about what isn't. It seemed as if 'power in numbers' was their attempt to make that change. Some of the most beautiful, thoughtful, empowering songs went into that. It seems now that the crew have made the decision to be so safe that the music just kind of sits there in easy listening territory. It is kinda like the smooth jazz of hip-hop. If you are a fan of where j5 was going with Cut Chemist, you will only find small flashes of that here. Cut Chemist may have taken j5's innovation with him when he left in 04. I personally prefer j5's old stuff and Cuts 'Audience's Listening' album to this. Hip-Hop fans beware. Soccer-Moms rejoice."
4,aahhhh,"It would be strongly advised to listen to the original ""Satta Massagana"" recordings before hearing these dub remakes to better bask in all of the beauty the Abyssinians have to offer, especially those beautiful voices and harmonies......BUT even if you don't, you can not help but be amazed by what this album has to offer. You still have the music pretty much intact, and tasty pieces of the roots reggae vocals that made Abyssinians songs what they were, on there to whet your appetite for more of this great trio.For me, however, as much as I love dub albums, the Abyssinians are best heard in their full vocal glory, and dub, by definition, will only give you small glimpses into what was really going on in any session, song, etc. Enjoy this album for the dub it offers- its straight forward and has great moments on it- but also get the original ""Satta Massagana"" lp to fully understand the Abyssinians experience."
4,Nice looking shoe,"This is nice looking,comfortable and true shoe size as mentioned. I am happy with this purchase."
3,not satisfied completely,"Good things first Shoe size is true, quick delivery, good price.But the shoe is heavy, for a sporty type shoe it has very little arch support and lastly the top material does not feel like leather feels more like vinyl."
3,"Nice shoes, great holiday price","I love these shoes. They look sporty, yet sophisticated and are in cool black.When I saw them online over Christmas, they were selling for $29.99 ea., then went down to $24.99 ea. and with the super saver discount plus free shipping and no tax, I was set! I even got $30 back after signing up for the Amazon Visa card."
4,very good,"great looking tought shoes, not quiet as good looking in the flesh as they are in photos, but good none the less."
3,Same concerns about quality as others,"I had some of the same concerns about quality as other reviewers. They're perfect for casual to business casual, as was said, but I had an unfortunate incident with a door that scraped against one of the Skechers, marring it. With most leather shoes, moderately frequent polishing would have resolved this, but it seems that the shoe will never recover due to the ultra-thin layer of leather.Still, I give these shoes 3 stars because they are comfortable and fine to wear for most situations."
1,cheap IS CHEAP!!,sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe. this case is a classic - you get what you pay for. cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe.2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick.3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe. feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST. 3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute. this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair)
5,Pure Excellence,"This CD is excellent. I bought it in France a couple of weeks ago because of the song ""You Are My High"" (although I don't see that song on this version of the CD) and I just cannot get enough of the CD! If you are into smooth dance music, you MUST get this one. The song ""Now That I Have You"" is very sexy and sensual. Each song has a very unique aspect to it. It is my new favorite CD. European dance music is just superb anyway- and this is a true testament to that fact. I wish that they would come out with more CDs."
4,A good book for gymnasts,I read this book when I was younger (though already a gymnast) and enjoyed the rather realistic portrayl of the sacrifices and dedication that being a serious gymnast requires. I recommend to young gymnasts.
3,"Not necessarily their best work, but worthy.","Some notably good tracks (""Backbeat"" and ""Beatback"" are two halves of a fun whole), but lacks the catchiness of the remixes (""Paranoimia"" lacks any of the Max Headroom voiceovers), and some are too dissonant to be really ear-friendly in the way that classic like ""Close (To The Edit)"" were (especially ""Eye ..."", etc.) Still, good music to have in the background, and a definite for any AON fan."
5,Takes you well away from where you are!,"Foal Cloud is adorable! The music is a treat. Bought this for childrens entertainment, but someone is going to have to explain the mating scenes to them....."
2,I found these on the Home Depot site,Magic Chef 0.7 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave in WhiteAssembled Depth (in.) : 12.4 inAssembled Height (in.) : 10.6 inAssembled Width (in.) : 17.6 in
1,Wish the description had dimensions.,"I agree that it's an oversight not to provide dimensions. How do I know this will fit the space I need it for? It looks exactly like what I want, but I wouldn't buy it without knowing the measurements."
1,Frustration,"It looks nice it sounds to be small enough, it's a shame that there are no dimensions mentioned. Having very limited space available I will need acurate dimensions- this was very frustrating"
3,lukewarm 80's collection,"As an avid 80's fan, I thought there was some great stuff on this cd and other stuff that wasn't so great. ""Maniac"", ""The Look of Love"", ""Cruel Summer"" and ""Into the Night"" are vintage 80's and makes up for the weaker songs such as ""Desire"" by Andy Gibb which sounds more like 70's disco era music and ""Pilot of the Airwaves"" which I was not familiar with. This song sounds more like a tune from the country genre. I remember the song by Bruce Willis from the 80's and find this cd unique for including it. I have never seen it on any other compilation. The better songs on this cd however, can be found on other 80's cd compilations that would include other good 80's material that would be more worth the money."
2,Répétitf,"Bien que cet album soit dans le pur ""roots"", il n'en demeure pas moins qu'il manque de mélodie et de créativité. Excusivement porté à l'attention de Sly et Robbie (que je trouve à tout coup décevant), je conseille cet album aux amateurs des twins brothers exclusivement."
2,Look elsewhere,"I bought this toy because my 5 year old son really wanted it. We purchased this for Christmas and we were all looking forward to playing it. We were very disappointed in the product. You have to use an arm to flip the flies into the frog's mouth which sounded easy enough. We found out that is was anything but easy. You had to push the arm just right in order to get a fly in the mouth. Too much, and it would go right over the mouth. You had to recognize how much is how much, and after 5 minutes my son (and myself) were fed up with trying to get 10 flies in the mouth. The 4 arms that attach to the mouth are not secure, you can't really move the game without everything falling off.I would definitly not recommend this game to anyone. After buying this product and re-reading the reviews, almost all of them say that the flies are hard to get in the mouth, I just didn't know HOW hard it was. Look elsewhere for a better game."
4,very fun,"I would not recommend this toy for anyone under 5, as it is quite difficult for a young child to get the flies in the frog's mouth. It took my 7 year old 10 minutes or so, before she got the hang of it. She started to lose hope, but finally got it. Now we all love to play it as a family!"
4,Great!!,This game is alot of fun. I have many games but I play with Mr. Mouth the most. The only bad thing is that you have to take his head off to store it in the box and it is difficult to get the head back on each time you want to play it.
1,never recieved mr mouth,"Item ordered dec 6. Item claimed to be shipped on Dec 9. Item charged to my account and shipping for item charged to my account. Item was actually not in stock and never shipped. Now I have to wait 2 billing cycles to recieve my refund. I pay my credit card at the end of the month, so this item was paid in full, by me, and I never recieved it. Now I have to play the waiting game while this company took my money for an item they did not have in stock"
4,great game for young kids!,"I just bought this game for my son after he played it at nursery school and fell in love with it. Yes, it is a LITTLE hard to get the flies into the frog's mouth, but that's the challenge of the game - and my son is 4 and doing fine with it. I just cannot believe how nitpicky some people are about toys like this."
1,Didn't work,"Our son was very excited when this came but because it was older, the batteries had corroded and didn't work. Sure wish he hadn't ripped the ox or we would have returned it. Waste of money."
2,Simple but fun,"While this toy doesn't offer much educational value, it is just plain, simple, old-fashioned fun and that's why I purchased it. That's what we're missing in kid's toys these days."
3,ok,"Make sure you like most of these tracks, because there's some filler (Frankie Valli??), the sound quality is variable (Van McCoy and George McRae sound like they were transferred from an old cassette), and there are no extended club versions. Earlier volumes in the Disco Nights series are better value."
3,"Good material, mediocre presentation..needs a rewrite.","Vincent Peale has written some 42 books...and his message is good. But given this book was first written in the 1970's, it is sometimes difficult to digest. What is said in 320 pages could have been said in 30 (quite wordy), the examples are far outdated (see below) and far too much attention is paid to supressing your emotions (therapists will tell you this is not good, feelings have to be dealt with). Example: Peale upholds Henry Ford as a shining beacon of a good person....Henry Ford was a great business leader but he was also a strong anit-semantic and was against employing people of color. The reader should also beware that Peale is a Christian minister.The book could use a re-write.The overall message however is still valuable today..Peale was one of the first to point out the Mind-Body connection and the Self-Prophesy theory..what you expect is what you get. You dont have to read the whole book to get the point though."
3,my thoughts.,what a person gets from this audio cd is the same thing you can get from any thing else you learn throughout life - you have to apply what you learn and make it work for you. nothing really new here. worth a listen.
4,I found this book to be very helpful esp. for people who need a push in their confidence,I found this book to be very helpful esp. for people who need a push in their confidence and an extension in managing self-doubt.
5,stomp box,You have to have this part of the box if you want the rest of the effect to work. I believe they do not sell them separate any longer and you have to have it if your going to get the module to work. The cool thing is that any of the modules will work in the box part so if you can find the modules separate from the box at a low price then get them because the price will go way up when line6 sells them as one unit.
5,Really nice knives,"I doubted the idea of buying Cuisinart knives, figured it was worth a shot at least until I could save up for better knives. I found myself pleasantly surprised, these are truly nice knives, good heft and balance. Sharp and easy to care for. Cannot speak for longevity, but I don't mind having to sharpen a knife now and then, I think this set will last a lot longer than I had planned."
4,Good everyday knife set,"I'm by no means a professional chef. I like to cook, and I know how to use a knife. These knives are good quality. I've used them daily for two months. I give em a few passes with the included sharpening stick about every other week and they are still razor sharp. Even my girlfriend, who abuses knives, hasn't done much damage. The knives are a good weight and a solid construction, fairly well balanced."
3,ok for the price,If you are looking for knives that are well weighted these are not the knives for you. They cut ok. They feel ok in your hand. They are nothing impressive but will get the job done.
2,Too many knifes for the holder,"Its great that they throw in an extra knife, however the wood block does not have enough slots. Now I have a razor sharp knife in the junk kitchen drawer. Poor planning by cuisinart."
4,Good knives for what they are,"These knives are not meant to compete with Wustof, Henkels, and Furi knives. What do you expect for $100?However, as a set of everyday knives I have found them to be very nice. They keep an edge after I gave them a proper sharpening, they look nice, and they get the job done without messing up your nice knives. I have a few pieces of professional cutlery and of course these don't compare, but I'm not going to throw $1000 down to get that type of set, either.Pros:Attractive set with a nice block.Clean up easily.Hold an edge for a good amount of time.Inexpensive.Cons:Not balanced (nothing is for this price)Handles are a tad small for someone like me with large hands.No slot in block for Santoku."
2,Referbished?????,"Won't by anything refurbished again. These knives were all extremely dull, and one the sm paring knife had a crack in the blade near the back. Also two of the knives had small knicks, including the bread knife . They should have never been on the market. I did not send them back, too much hassle. I did sharpen them, and are now usable. Spend the extra and get Trident, there is no comparison."
2,Rust spots,These knives are already showing spots of rust despite washing by hand & drying. Very disappointed in quality of finish.
3,A finishing touch to a collection rather than the beginning,"Heartbeat has a consistently good collection of essential studio one masters. This is a part of it. But its not the most consistent of them all. Easily, Hit Bound, the Revolutionary Sound of Channel One on Heartbeat is the best, followed by The Best of Studio One, v.1, are the two most accessible. Also look for Studio One masters of your favorite artists on Heartbeat, such as Johnny Osbourne and Sugar Minott, and you wont be disappointed."
4,A little easy,"Could just be because I'm a child of the era, but I find this version a little bit too un-challenging for my tastes. Still fun though."
5,A great party game!,"A regular Genus IV player, I highly reccommend it as a way to liven up small gatherings, particularly if you pit women against men! Compared with the original, the questions seem easier and less meaty. Additionally, the Sports and Leisure category seems to be more leisure and less sports. In general, I think that fans of the first edition will find the update enjoyable but far from challenging."
3,Genus IV is for genius,"This is one of the last great editions of Trivial Pursuit, before it was taken over by Hasbro.One downside: even though several reviews suggest that this edition contains questions that are reasonably easy, I believe those people have been baseball and NFL fans for over 20 years. A lot of questions are way too detail-oriented.Otherwise, entertaining, educational and fun!"
3,Should not have removed literature!,"This still has some of the same fun as the older versions, but it was very disappointing that they removed the literature category in favor of more TV based questions. Also, the questions seemed far more ""trivial"" and far less educational than with the older models."
1,Too Easy to Be Entertaining,"I wish they would make a Trivial Pursuit for teenagers, and one for adults. I really like the format and the idea behind the game. As a teenager, I really enjoyed the questions, but with this edition I find that the questions are way too easy. The attraction of a trivia game is being able to impress your friends with what you know or be wowed by what they know. If the questions are so easy it is just not competitive. Some of the questions even contained lame hints to the answer! I tried to salvage my ... investment by buying the Know-It-All cards, but I was disappointed with those, too. I am not a PhD, there should be at least a few questions in a trivia game that do not insult me with their obviousness. You Don't Know Jack has much better questions, and is a lot more fun overall."
2,Maybe only for hard-core film noir fans,"I ssupect that if you are a real fan of the genre then this might be a very good film, but for me it simply dragged on and on to no purpose. I can't complain about the performances (I thought Angie was great, as was Dean Wormer), but the direction seemed like it was trying to hard be too daring and artsy (some of the lingering shots just seemed tedious)."
3,Most accidents happen within three miles of home,"I dunno, I sense an approach at ""style"", but it's still early in this director's career...and it just hasn't jelled yet. Compared to ""Bullitt"", released a year later, this film is kinda thin. A viewer can allow himself to be drawn in, but for me the whole thing is not fully realised. You want it to work, but it doesn't reach cruising altitude. Mr Marvin was born for this role, but his stoic silence doesn't create any kind of character beyond the revenge angle. Perhaps that's the point. That's his ""Point"", and he is ""Blank"" (!) I will admit there is a consistant feeling of unreality, that fits in with the theory that it is all a dying man's fever dream. Actually, this might be a ""ghost"" film, predating ""The Sixth Sense"". It's worth watching, and repeat viewings may reward."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Frankly overrated, Point Blank largely consists of Lee Marvin drudging his his way up the San Francisco criminal food chain to find out who set him up, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake; if you've seen any sort of revenge thriller you'll have a good idea what's going to happen, and you'll probably long for a more interesting or expressive actor in the lead."
4,Innovative noir,"Double-crossed by his best friend (John Vernon) and his wife (Sharon Acker), a tough guy (Lee Marvin) works his way up the hierarchy of a criminal syndicate in a quest for revenge and his money.Director John Boorman adds interest to his straightforward narrative with techniques that are occasionally disorienting and always illustrative of his protagonist's bleak state of mind. Marvin is at his best as a man who sublimates his humanity in service of his objective. The possibility some reviewers cite that the whole film might be the fantasy of a dying man slipped by me, so I may watch it again some day."
3,Point Blank Blank,"The movie arrived quickly, but there was no chapter list and the copy was a tad dark."
3,"Hard to follow film, but worthwile for fine acting","This period piece starts out fuzzy. How did Marvin's character escape Alcatraz after being shot, and where did he recooperate? Who is the shadowy character that helps him bring down ""The Organization?"" What the hell is this ""Organization?""Anyway, the film then turns into a revenge film, and Lee Marvin's ferocious performance erupts often enough to keep your interest."
1,OVERBLOWN OVERRATED IDIOCY,"INCREDIBLY OVERRATED UNBELIEVABLE NONSENSE--BLOATED SELF IMPORTANT DRIVEL--- BAD DIALOGUE-- NOTHING REMOTELY BELIEVABLE OR INTERESTING HAPPENS BOORMAN THINKS HES BEING HIP OR CUTTING EDGE W THIS NOIR MISFIRE--- ITS VERY ANNOYING GRATING AND JUST PLAIN MISGUIDED--LOTS OF FIGHTS ,SHOOTING THINGS UP-- CHASES--ALL BADLY DONE--- HOLLYWOOD AT ITS WORST AND MOST OUT OF TOUCH---- DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE---- A WASTE OF TIME MONEY ETC----I FOUND IT EMBARASSINGLY INSIPID AND UNWATCHABLE !!!!"
5,Point Blank,"John Boorman's peerless crime drama is one of the great films of the 1960's. Marvin is a walking, talking time bomb as the obsessed Walker, and Lloyd Bochner looks and acts the part of chief betrayer Frederick Carter. Angie Dickinson is her sexiest as femme fatale Chris, who hops between men (and beds) with ease. And just wait for a pre-Archie Bunker Carroll O'Connor in a pivotal role as Brewster, the big boss. One of my personal favorites, with a palpable sixties look and feel. Pounce, action fans."
3,Point Blank: A Parker Movie?,"Let us see. Lee Marvin is tall and lanky; Parker isn't. Lee has light hair; Parker doesn't. In my opinion, Lee does a lot of stuff looking like he doesn't know what stuff he is supposed to be doing. The movie is alright I suppose but I had a hard time tracking it with the book (The Hunter). I like Richard Stark's voyage into this type of books and I understand why he would not let them use Parker's name in the movies."
4,Somewhere between beat and hippie,"What a wild portrayal of this period. FUN! I get where is shows the transition from beatnik to hippie. Something you might see at a Beatnik Coffee House. Cool man, cool!"
3,Lack of in-depth characterisation and dramatic action,"Kureishi aims at writing a story in which the characters confuse each other with sexual desire and also, most importantly, the true nature of love. And, honestly speaking, it is quite a hard plot to deal with, especially in drama. Owing to the limitation on not writing everything explicitly in words, the story depends on dialogues to tell the readers the chaotic romance within the story. The book I have read so far, which can successfully deal with such a difficult plot is however, a gay novel - Larry Kramer's Faggots. Sleep with me has a potentially good and intriguing plot; however, there are not enough actions to dramatise the chaos. In other words, the chaos are not chaotic enough. The story is there. It happens by itself. It fails to pull the readers into the core of the drama. Finally, when you close the book, you will realise that something has happened, but nothing's changed."
3,Not as good as the first book...,"I loved the stories and materials from the first book. This second one is alright, the stories are fine but the patterns are horrible. I ended up having to re-draw most of the patterns because they have ""drop shadows"" on them, which makes transferring and cutting them out of wood a pain. The stories are not as in-depth as the first book either, but that's probably due to their scope being more focussed- instead of trying to tell the ""big"" story and combine lots of the different ways it's told in the bible these just tell the one story from John or Acts..."
1,MEL GIBSON THEOLOGY,"She asks Sunday school teachers to discuss to discuss The Crucification with 3- 5 year olds. She asks teachers to tell 3-5 year olds that many people wanted Jesus killed and that he was""nailed"" to the cross. This is not age appropriate for 3-5 year olds. It is also the type of theology that Mel Gibson follows - a very literal telling of events. There is a more intelligent way to teach Chritianity to pre-schoolers. This is the kind of book I would expect from someone who has memorized most of the passages in the Bible and sadly understands very few of them."
4,... like if Jellyfish were a lot less clever ...,"Upside of Down is a solid pop release which is thoroughly enjoyable in it's own right. Why people feel the need to compare it to Jellyfish is beyond me. I have not experienced The Tories' first release (Wonderful Life, which I am told it is considerably better), but this album seems quite increadibly bland when contrasted to the magnificent Spilt Milk. So - Jellyfish lovers beware: this may not be the album you've been craving! If you are a fan of good pop generally, then Upside of Down is no dud. The guitars are rich and the vocal harmonies are impressive, but in no way are they as complex, intelligent or quite as beautiful as anything from the Sturmer/Manning catalogue. Perhaps you shoud try The Sun Sawed In 1/2 'Fizzy Lift' if this album leaves you a little bit cold."
3,buy it,"not as good as the first cd(wonderfull life) Still a must buy, for their great sound, vocals, and guitar work."
5,My favorite CD,"I consider this CD the most perfect quintessence of power pop experience.(The voices, the lyrics, the arrangements and the tunes).My secret will is that this CD had been released by me!The songs vary from slow ballads to upbeats rocks. Beautiful and inspired voices chorus.They didn't intend to create a new musical style but I don't care, because Tories was a great Californian band that has released just two CDs.Tories and many other great power pop bands (Big Star, Badfinger, Fountains of Wayne, Teenage Fanclub) or great indie rock bands (Tonic, Phantom Planet) or until good and happy teenager bands (Busted, McFly) are very grateful that Beatles have existed!This CD is a little bit more mature than ""Wonderful Life"".Two songs are very special for me: ""All The World's For Sale"" and ""The Upside of Down"""
5,very good,I totally love this CD. This are great stars. I can't beleive you don't hear them on the radio.
1,Dakota WPA-3000 Wireless Probe Driveway Alert Kit - POOR!,"Poor range for transmitter, it says it has a range of 600', I could not get it to reliably function at less than half that range. Product was installed on flat ground and ""line of sight"" to receiver. Even at close range probe would not reliably detect a vehicle. Strongly recommend you pass on this device. The only reason I rated it at one star is because there was not a lower rating. I have worked in the electrical/electronic industry for over 30 years and feel qualified to describe this device as an inferior product that will not function as described.Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."
4,Driveway alert,"This kit was easy to install. It doesn't always catch vehicles coming up our drive. Not sure why. But I'd say it catches 95% of them, which is way more than what we dealt with before. Since I have to plow the drive in the Winter, I chose the buried transponder. It also doesn't give us false positives when deer, dogs, et al pass through. Like it a lot!"
4,Driveway Alert Kit,"I am very pleased with my Driveway Alert Kit. I looked at other devices and read all of the reviews. This one was highly rated, and I am not disappointed. Our long driveway is hidden from our living room. I wanted something to warn me of a car approaching my house. I laid the device beside the driveway, and placed the wireless box on a nearby tree. I have had to move it a couple of times, and to raise and lower the sensitivity, but now it works very well. I recommend this product."
5,Great Driveway Alert!,After much research my husband and I settled on the WPA 3000 wireless probe. We have had other driveway alert products that have not functioned as advertised and this time we wanted one that just worked! The WPA 3000 didn't take long to install and worked perfectly! It is just great to know when a car comes up the driveway! It does not register animals just vehicles which is also nice as we live in the country with lots of animals around. My husband put the control in a birdhouse that you can purchase for the 3000. Now you only see the birdhouse and it protects the control.I highly recommend the WPA 3000 Wireless Probe Driveway Alert!
1,Junk,"Had it only a few weeks when I had to send in the transmitter for repair. It still worked only intermittently. Moved the probe to several different locations, it didn't help. The distance was only about 400 feet. I move it to about 200 feet with the transmitter in direct line to house. Still works intermittently. Probe is in driveway. This wouldn't even pick up UPS truck. If you want something reliable, this is not it."
1,Dakota Alert WPA-3000,Worthless junk. Out of the box it was clearly cheaply constructed. I started at one end of my driveway and kept moving towards the house until it managed to chime. By then I was within 150ft and it needed a completely clear line of sight. Later that night it rained and the thing went haywire. It never recovered. Don't waste your money.
2,Works Sometimes,Not a reliable notification. I have it right in the center of my driveway. It is in a slot protecting it from damage but there is nothing to shield it from the vehicle overhead. It will recognize large trucks like 3/4 ton but will not pickup the small pickups many people drive. Sometimes it pickups my car and sometimes it does not.
2,Max 600 Range is over estimated by far.,I had the transmitter set at 300 feet from the receiver and could not get WPA 3000 to work. The area that the transmitter was located was clear trees and no hills. I had to move the transmitter 150 feet before it would work properly. After that it worked fine. The speaker on the receiver is distorted and crackles. I suggest that if you plan to go further than 150 feet. Get the model that is 2500 feet maybe you can get 300 feet.
1,It doesn't work. Ripped off by ANTOnline.,I bought one of these for my parents. I purchased it from Amazon merchant ANTOnline. It does not work. ANTOnline has my money and shipped me a complete piece of junk.I took what money I had left after I foolishly blew around $250 on this piece of junk that doesn't work and adopted a dog to alert my parents when a car is coming up the driveway. He was a lot cheaper and works a lot better than the wireless probe kit.I guess we all live and learn.
1,WPA-3000 Wireless Probe,Got no more than 115 feet line-of-sight with no obstruction. Called manufacturer; they wanted to fix. It was new out of the box; returned it to Amazon for refund.
2,Owner user,"Works poorly, does not work consistently beyond 400 feet and stops working at one whim or another. I have used this product with three transmitters and none worked as advertised, 3000 feet is a dream. Make sure of the companies return policy before ordering this product."
1,3000 foot range? The manual says 600 feet!,"What a rip off!I bought this piece of junk because the amazon ad said 3000' range. When I got it, the manual says 600' and that doesn't even work. I have it about 300 feet, and that doesn't work.It's a completely useless piece of you-know-what.Save your money! Buy anything else, or just set your money on fire, since that will save you a lot of time."
1,Unreliable Junk!,"This product is very unreliable and the support of Absolute Automation AKA Quick Alarms -- the Ontario, Canada dealer -- has been very poor. I will never buy another Dakota Alert product, nor will I recommend their products or dealers to anyone. Stay away from this product; it's junk."
1,Did not work for me,"I really wanted this to work for me. I was so disappointed, even with clear line of sight it was 75' MAX, never mind the 500' through the woods I was hoping for. At any rate, Amazon refunded me 100%, this is why I shop here on Amazon with confidence that if I am not happy with a product Amazon will pay the shipping back to them and give me a 100% product refund. I shop more & more here every year. I have been looking into the wired ones to fit the bill."
2,Good if the price were $20 - $40,"It is not reliable. Works 90% of the time which sounds good but 1 out of 10 times we have looked out in the parking lot and there are customers and the unit did not work. VERY BAD. We have replaced the cr123's which are not cheap and it did not help.If it is just a casual concern if you ""want"" to know if a vehicle has come in, then the unit is for you. If you MUST know everytime, don't buy it.A reasonable price for this unit should be in the $20-$40."
2,Very disappointed - don't buy this,"Thank God for Amazon's return policy. My Dakota was defective out of the box.Even after following all the instructions I could not get it to work properly. Only when I had the transmitter and receiver 150 feet apart could I get a reliable signal. Something in either the transmitter or receiver is not working properly. I tested the batteries. My brother and I with walkie-talkies tried every conceivable combinations of sensitivity, distance and placement. Still no signal or erratic. Couldn't wait to pack it up and get rid of it."
1,"Brutal, BUT the new 2500 version is awesome!","I bought the WPA-3000 and it just didn't work for me. Intermittent and nowhere near the advertised wireless range. However, I called the company I had bought the product from (Absolute Automation - [..]) and they took the WPA-3000 back letting me purchased the DCPA-2500 from them. Still made by Dakota, but the thing has worked flawlessly for me since I've had it. If you're considering the Dakota Alert 3000 products take a look at the 2500's instead. You will be much happier! Also, can't say enough good things about Absolute Automation. They really helped me out, I thought I was stuck with a no good alarm."
5,Loyalties,"It's 1945. A stranger comes to town. The stranger is Spencer Tracy and the town is like something from Wild West lore. In fact Tracy's MacCreedy is the only link to the mid 20th Century. It's obvious from the beginning that the small conglomeration of townsfolk are hiding a dark secret. MacCreedy has come to town to give a resident farmer, Komoko, the medal his son earned saving MacCreedy's life in World War II. There is a real feeling of menace from the beginning and the tension doesn't let up as the crossed alliances unfold. This is a well acted, understated action film that really packs a punch."
4,The First of the Karate Movies!,"Before 'Enter the Dragon' and 'Billy Jack' there was 'Bad Day at Black Rock'. Alledgedly, this movie started the first karate craze in the U.S. This is a taut, tense thriller about bigotry, fear, and wasted lives. There are five actors in this movie who won Oscars at one time or another (Spenser Tracy, Walter Brennan, Ernest Borgnie, Lee Marvin and Dean Jagger). And then there is Robert Ryan who is at his vulpine best. 'Bad Day at Black Rock' is a figure of speech that has entered the vernacular that signifies that one is having a bad day. See this movie and you'll know why the phrase caught on."
3,Good PLAY At Black Rock,"This movie looks and sounds like a play. The ""town"" looks like nine or ten buildings total and I to be honest looks like it was placed in the middle of a California desert i.e. not to believeable as a ""real"" town. Also, what do the people of this town do? Why does the train stop every four or five years? From the moment the train first stops EVERY (and I do mean every) eye is placed on this ""stranger"". Are they that guilt-ridden to sit around day after day with nothing to do until the train stops, and then follow Tracy around like a puppy dog? Is this a town without pity? Tracy does a fine job as the stranger. The stunning Anne Francis looks as beautiful as ever, however would a woman who looks like her REALLY hang around this town? Glad to see the issue of racism addressed in this film however and glad it was the point of this film. From that standpoint alone it was worth watching. I do think ""Bad Day"" would make an even better play."
2,Not as good as advertised,"I saw this movie years ago and remembered it had a few really good scenes. Then I bought the soundtrack and was shocked to hear such a big, powerful, dynamic score. It didn't fit the movie I remembered at all. So I rented it from NetFlix to see it again.I was disappointed. When you know the secret the town is hiding and why Tracy has come to visit (which I remembered), the movie loses much of it's punch. And that score! It's great but it overpowers the small plot of the film and doesn't fit at all. There's a tremendous cast, but none of them has enough of a role to get their teeth into except maybe Ernest Borgnine.The plot is slim, and the behavior of the townspeople doesn't seem right. Maybe they updated the script from 1870 to 1945 or something. It's just not right.And those few scenes I remembered? They're still there and they're still good! But the rest of the movie is not up to the same standard."
3,1950s paranoia just misses the mark,"an interesting take on small-town paranoia, as an entire community is subsumed by the attempt to cover up an old murder in the mistaken belief that they are about to be found out. spencer tracy plays the unwitting investigator, with robert ryan his principal antagonist and dean jagger, walter brennan, lee marvin, and ernest borgnine among a cast of familiar faces either proactively or tacitly hiding the truth. sad to say, director john sturges (whose work on films like ""great escape"" or ""gunfight at the ok corral"" i admire) was not up to the themes involved here, and what could have been a great political thriller instead is merely a good adventure pic -- but hey, thats not bad either ..."
3,Audio track for french language - discusting,"The english audio track is good, but as far as the french track it's not worth a penny, noise on the track are so loud; My French friends we're so disappointed.I think WB is producing full sh.. DVD and have no respect for customer. They don't do quality testing on DVD products...It's an excellent movie, but not the right compagny to produce a DVD..."
5,im satisfyed but............,"hi thanks for your best services i recived my dvd cd of BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK within time in mumbai india, but sir the money is didected from my 2 credit cards for 2 dvd cds. and i got only 1 dvd cd. so plz try to send another dvd cd of the same as soon as possibleim happy with your services and thinking to place some more ordersthanks SUBHASH JADHAV"
5,A great movie to relax and watch,"I loved this movie and had waited for the dvd to finally come available. It is clear and a wonderful copy of the first reel that ran in the movie houses. The action is strong and never dull and ofcourse the actors are some of the greatest in Hollywood at that time. I don't believe the movie is based on a true life fact , however it could have happened and that is what I liked about it. It is easy to put yourself in Macreedy's {Spencer Tracy} position and then ask yourself ""what would I do"". It is a class A movie in every detail. I watch it offen . Hope you enjoy it as well. Wiley"
4,Great Great Classic!!,"I wish they would still make films like this!! Filmed throughout the rugged hills in Lone Pine Ca locations off the 395!! Story is ok, but the scenery and characters are amazing!! Somewhat an underground type film for the great Spencer Tracy! I can watch it over and over!!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A modern western, Bad Day at Black Rock is a slight but enjoyable tale of a stranger coming into town and arousing suspicion; notable as one of the first (if not the first) film to mention the Japanese internment during WWII, BDaBR is a decent film that has been somewhat overrated but is still worth a look."
5,Bad day at Black Rock. What is everyone in this town trying to hide?,"There is something sinister going on at Black Rock, What is it with this little town? what is happening or what happened? why are the locals so mistrusting of outsiders?(more than the norm) that all changes of course when Our Main Protagonist arrives on the scene, and although it is a long movie, I think it is a work of art.I rented it at my local library and it is very Good.(its also in COLOR)"
1,PASS on this... you'll be glad you did,"Buying this book is like buying a generic tampon: the next day you wonder what in the heck were you thinking. In 40 years of reading this is the only book I've never finished. After 50 pages I threw my hands up in the air. By 200 pages I dropped this in the lake and said good riddens to so much bad baggage. I've never read a book that was as poorly written. The whole thing stinks of a ""vanity"" printing, suffice to say I'll never buy another book by this author ever again."
1,A classic? Hardly.,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. I started reading it expecting something great, but by page 100 I realized that nothing significant would happen within the text. There may be some underlying themes in the novel but frankly, the book is so terrible that I don't wish to explore them."
5,Travels in Alaska,I am enjoying reading all I can about Alaska lately and this one is just one to add to that list!
3,A very educational read.,A educational read for anyone curious or dealing with the issue of how to completely disagree in your partner in your marriage with complete respect and without losing your own.
4,"A brief, poetic glimpse into leprosy","Rebeccasreads recommends THE PEARL DIVER as a sad, strange, exquisitely written if disjointed glimpse into the Japanese treatment of people infected with leprosy in a time when the medical community did not understand the disease & was filled with shame & prejudice. The only redemption & humanity in this tale is found in the compassion of the internees in the colony.Could not put it down!"
2,Difficult,This was very hard to read and follow. Just didn't care for it at all. Know of others who read it also and found it hard to follow.
2,"Quiet, slow sad story",The premise was interesting about a young pearl diver that gets leprosy and goes to live on an island for lepers. I liked the main character but didn't really connect to the sad story. I read it to the end thinking that there would be something rewarding but I didn't experience it. Maybe if I was doing some research on leprosy in Japan it would have been more worth my time to read.
4,an insight into a time of the past,"this is the courageous story of a young girl who was a pearl diver and found to be afflitcted with leprosous. It follows her life on to adulthood and how she tries to make a normal life for herself. I found it ver interesting and well written. It is a triumph over a dreadful disease. thank heavens theyhave found something to slow the progress, and some can lead a life in public."
4,"Haunting, interesting, vaguely annoying","Like everyone else, I ordered this book because I thought leprosy would be an interesting theme in a novel.What I wasn't expecting was the exotic feeling from reading the book. The book feels very Japanese in tone, not just setting. The story itself hints and puzzles--doesn't answer all your questions about either characters or the leprosy colony. It's a book that leaves you hungry for more--a frustrating and yet intriguing technique that you rarely get in a novel. I liked this feeling until I turned the page and the book was over. Then I wished for just a little more..."
3,Moving voice for so many that suffered,"This book leaves me feeling heavy with sadness, Miss Fuji who seemed to have lived a whole lifetime without getting to really live one day. Disease is powerful, human fear is more so. I am glad I read the Pearl Diver, being one of those books that makes you happy for the life you have and maybe appreciate it just a little bit more than you did before."
5,An Insightful Exploration of Illness and Self-Discovery,"This novel explores the life of a young woman afflicted with leprosy in 1940's Japan. The story follows her throughout her life and treatment of her disease. The author gives you sketches of the different periods of her life, her treatment and her circumstances.Talarigo uses prose, poetry, historical artifacts and narrative to share the story of Miss Fuji. He asks the questions that people afflicted with chronic illnesses ask - things like ""Am I cursed?"" ""Why have I been isolated from those I love?"" ""Who am I with this illness?"" He explores identity, crisis and meaning within the framework of this wonderful novel.The Pearl Diver is a novel that you will read in one sitting. Take it to the beach, take it to your favorite chair, take it with you everywhere until the story is done!"
4,Gold Mining in Interior Alaska-what it's REALLY like!,"I live in interior Alaska and have lived at a gold mine myself, and the story told here is not only interesting, but very true to life. I found it an easy read, an enjoyable story, and a book I know I will keep on my shelf and read again. Otis shares his first-hand view of the life of a miner, and tells his story with all the ups and downs he encounters with a sense of humor. Buy two copies, you'll want to share this one with a friend."
1,Very disappointed that articles are ancient history,"I usually enjoy Dan Tapscott's books, but this one disappointed me because only 2 of the 12 articles in the book were written in 1998. The remainder date back to as early as 1993-- ancient history in the Internet world."
4,a cheaper way to get 12 essential HBR reprints + intro,"Despite the publication dates 1993-1998, the issues addressed in these articles are not those with short shelf life: trust as an asset, virtual organization management versus traditional 'command and control' styles, etc.Much of what is said here is obvious in 1999, sure, to you who already buy books on Amazon.com... but to your neolithic bosses and managers?I read most of these articles when they came out, but even so I found Don Tapscott's introduction summarized them very well and added some real value. So don't be put off by the reprint status."
4,A Great Video For Chartering,My fiance purchased this video to give us an idea what to expect in the British Virgin Islands before we went chartering with the Moorings.The video not only helped us to see what the BVI's were like but also what we could find on shore at the various destinations. The approaches to the anchorages were right on and the video was better than we could have taken ourselves.This was our first time chartering in the BVI's and the video along with the cruising guides and charts really helped.If you plan on chartering in the BVI's I would highly recommend this video.
1,What the Hell?,Is there no english on this DVD or what? I clicked on all of the chinese options and not one has english subtitles.
4,Nicee ....,"Good movie , I didn't kno this history of china before get united , very good legends of patriots there"
4,good movie,"Always enjoy international movies, we have quite a collection. This was delivered in a timely manner and we have not had the time to sit down and watch it yet."
3,Its ok,"The international version of Chi Bi (Red Cliff) is much better then this movie, but this is ok. I got it for really cheep, and it was an entertaining movie, but thats about it. Andy Lau and Samo are good in this, but with two great actors, good is a bit disappointing."
2,Three Kingdoms,This is not one of Andy Lau's better movies.There's nothing engaging in this movie.The battle scenes are not that great.The characters needed to be developed more and whatever happend to Andy Lau's girlfriend/love intrest that said she would wait for him until the war was over?Maybe I missed it because the story is kinda hard to follow too.I didn't like the ending either.
3,Shallow,"(1.) See ""Red Cliff"" series - well, you probably already have so you are aware of the comparison (fair or unfair as it may be).(2.) Great acting and good photography and setting although how a desert water worn gully should figure into this bit of China's history is beyond me.(3.) The isolated small temple with dirt ramp was a bit theatrical and cheap.(4.) The swords and spears and other techy weapons look cutesy-decorative but don't instill much historical confidence in the viewer.(5.) The fighting, blood etc. was pretty typical ho-hum.There's not much more to the movie as it was not meant to be an historically accurate recreation but an interpretation.Overall: Shallow, disjointed and forgettable."
1,Bad DVD Quality - Looks like pirating from Theater,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon. Paid over $20 more dollar. The quality of the DVD BOX and DVD Disk print are blurt that it actually looks like pirate DVD. When I look at the DVD movie, there are frame that has some strange object on the screen. It made me think that this DVD was duplicated by filming the movie in the theater."
2,Bad repersentation of a great story.,"This is a poorly written, and directed take on ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", which is a historical novel that is considered one of China's most important novel. The story follows a warrior named Zhao ""Zilong"" Yun. The fist half of the movie is decent at best, the action scenes are poorly directed because it's difficult to tell what is going on. The second half of the movie, which completely abandons its historical source and follows some completely made up story where Zhao Zilong fights a fictional female general. The story jumps around from year to years and lacks any real emotional impact. Overall this movie was a horrible experience and a shame to the Three Kingdoms story itself.You should get ""Red Cliffs"" which is a movie that is also based on the Three Kingdoms, that came out around the same time as this one, is much, much better, and actually historical."
4,Acceptable!,I'm in the military and purchased this watch mainly for Land Navigation. When switched to MGRS this watch performed above my expectations. While in the desert the watch performed outstanding and outfited my squad with a ten digit grid. I love this watch mainly for military use the only downfall to me is the battery life.
4,Suunto x9i,"Well, I paid a lot for this watch as my fiance is an Army Scout and he really wanted the better watch of the selections he had to pick from. He had it for 2 days and the rubber covering on the side buttons came OFF. Was NOT happy to hear that. Not the sellers problem, Suunto's problem. Can you imagine if he had went to the field or I sent it to him on deployment!? I am concerned that the rubber covering being gone that particles will get into the buttons and mess it up. Will be sending it in to Suunto.The watch came in the box in perfect condition and very quickly. Was happy with the seller."
1,I feel deep regret for buying this watch,"I tried to like this watch, I really did. The GPS can take up to 5 minutes to get a lock. Everytime. The GPS isn't accurate. The watch is fragile. After I gave up trying to use the GPS, I just wore it as an everyday watch. Then the casing for the face broke. I had to mail the watch to Suunto to get it fixed. Now if I try to use the GPS the log file aborts immediately. This watch is worthless."
3,ok... but expensive,"Should have ordered a Garmin etrex and a sunto vector. Amazon shipped me the wrong color watch...but I was in Iraq and needed a watch and didn't want to wait another 4 weeks to get one. Then it broke (the cover/bezel/frame) the third time I used it.Pros:1. Small (compared to other GPS watches)2. Accurate (compared to military maps and GPS)3. has MGRS4. good quality charger/acessories/softwear5. battery lasts a long time (w/o using GPS) before needing to be rechargedCons:1. because it's small, it has hard to use button combos2. does not appear sturdy and it broke easily (but still works)3. if I am moving at all, I can't get a fix.4. Need a computer to take full advantage of features"
1,give it a pass,"I bought this watch from REI. The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC. On the second two the plastic housing started separating. That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading. Too bad, the watch sounded so good..."
1,struggle to operate,"I bought this for a 10 day trek across africa, followed up by a North Pole trek. What a challenge to get to operate, and when it did start to operate it would stop recording mid day. Also battery life is weak, didn't make it across africa. PS I'm a computer geek, so it may be user error but doubtful."
2,"Small, all in one device BUT lacking in user friendliness","If what you want is a very small interface loaded w/ features and you're willing to sacrifice 'user friendliness' and graphic display, then this watch is for you. Navigating the various functions can be tricky and GPS, Compass and Altitude functions will need to calibrated regularly in order to be usably accurate. Also note that the GPS function quickly drains the rechargeable battery so for long outings you will need to use this function sparingly. Another factoid: although the watch is water proof to >50m (not sure exactly) the manual warns of pressing ANY button while the watch is submerged at any depth as this could short out the electronics. I returned this watch and decided to go with a hand held GPS device that has the same functions."
2,"Old and useful, but get something else","Even though the fifth edition of this book was published in 1961, this book still gives a useful and brief introduction to probability. However, if you're going to buy a book to learn statistics or probability, I would suggest a more recent book. They may not be as brief and concise as this, but newer books would be more up to date. One interesting thing about the Gnedenko/Khinchin book is their examples and problems, which involve things such as the production of artillery shells, or hitting targets with cannons. It is a very welcome change from the traditional, but obvious examples that use decks of cards or dice. Also, it says things about the audience for whom this book was originally meant, and the relevant topics of the time of the cold war. Still, I suggest a more recent text."
2,It could have been great,"One really dumb idea was to record her sequence while she was standing in tall grass. I know, it's romantic and beautiful and at one with nature etc., but we need to see the feet. Duh.My second gripe is about the lost opportunity. To do this right, you need two, maybe three views. One view would be with her back to the camera, so we can follow without transposing our left and right. Another would be a moving camera that is always facing her back, so that, as the movement revolves, we can maintain orientation.I do like the organization and the idea, here."
1,Do not waste your money,"I tried the Scott Cole beginning Tai-Chi(excellent) and figured this was more instruction and all 24 poses. Yes, she does the poses but it is impossible to follow. The camera angles do not allow for the study of the hand or feet positions and she offers no explaination., This is a complete waste of money. I am returning it to Amazon for my 50% loss."
1,Therapeutic excreta,"My medical dictionary defines uropathy as ""any pathologic change in the urinary tract."" Lara describes his method as a ""Holistic Therapy."" This gives us a strong clue as to its origin. My own Rx (for him) would be an extended course of autocacophagia."
4,bad postal service,the game arrived in fair used condition which was expected. unfortunately the U.S.Postal service put a huge hole through the entire package!! a whole over 4 inches wide now resides in the bottom of the game.would reccomend better shipping packaging next time (bubble wrap??) or use a different carrier!!
3,"Fine movie, but the quality isn't really good","The film was OK, but the quality of the VHS was kind of buzzy at times. It also turned out to be recorded to the tape, as if it wasn't a genuine copy. I'll try to look for a more genuine version next time."
4,Fine,"The movie is great, I had seen it before buying it but watching it in blu-ray was a great experience."
5,A few Good Men is a classic,"I absolutely love A Few Good Men. I have watched it at least 30 times. It was Tom Cruise at his most wonderful! And who can forget the incredible exchange between Tom and Jack Nicholson that erupts into ""You can't handle the truth!!!"" absolutely wonderful!!"
5,My son loves this movie,My son love's this movie. every time it comes on cable he has to watch it lol So I got it for him so he can watch it any time he wants. Thanks for the speedy shipping and it came in great condition. will buy again! :)
4,Good classic! You can't handle the truth!,This is one from the 90's an oldie but goodie for you people that may have missed out on it. Bluray transfer is good nice and crispy!
5,Excellent,"A few good men is a court room drama successfully showcasing a controversial case of right and wrong. The plot is not one hundred percent perfect, but short of that, everything else about the movie is par excellence. This is one of those movies where an ordinary story is turned into outstanding screenplay, delivered to perfection by the director and the cast. I rank this as Tom Cruise's best, closely followed by The Firm and Rainman.A timeless classic and a collectors item."
5,"The most gripping, thought-provoking film of the decade.","This film captures the classic dichotomy of the military: our need for protection and security versus the abuse of power of the protectors. The film also captures the essence of being a professional: when it comes right down to it, there is no one but the professional (in this case Kaffey) to make the call and take the credit--or the blame. The actors playing the major characters all gave peak performances."
5,A Few Good Men,"This engrossing military-legal thriller from director Rob Reiner soars thanks to Aaron Sorkin's gripping, expertly paced script (based on his hit Broadway play) and a brawny, high-wattage cast: Cruise and Moore make a winning pair of legal eagles, Bacon is commanding as Kaffee's courtroom nemesis, and Jack Nicholson delivers one of his most indelible performances as arrogant, tough-as-nails Col. Nathan Jessup, who may or may not know more than he claims. Dealing with illegal hazing, government cover-ups, and the outer limits of military honor, ""Men"" packs a double-barreled wallop. Can you handle the truth?"
5,classic and superb blu ray release,"This movie is a classic. Top notch production, script, directing, and acting. The final court scene with Jack Nicholson was breath-taking. A serious movie for a serious movie buff. This double-layer bluray looks and sounds FANTASTIC. Video is encoded in MPEG2 but it is stunning. PCM audio makes the sound effects come alive. If you love this movie like I did, you must indulge yourself with this bluray release. I do not think it will get any better for a long long time."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A courtroom drama more intelligent than most, A Few Good Men zips through its 135-minute running length with the help of crisp editing and good performance all around; while the movie probably wasn't worthy of a Best Picture nomination, it most assuredly is worthy of your time."
4,Can you handle the truth? Cracker(JACK) cast & script with Reiner at the top of his game,"Absorbing and crowd-pleasing adaptation of Aaron Sorkin's hit Broadway play from director Rob Reiner about two Marines charged with the murder of a fellow GI at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with a tangled web of power and a green defense lawyer (excellently played by Cruise) assigned to follow the motions without a trial. Superb performances all around especially Nicholson in rare form as a colonel with one hell of a Napoleon complex. Trivial note: Bodison was a production assistant to Reiner from previous films; this is his acting debut."
2,Nothing new here,"Let's see. Tom Cruise plays the diamond-in-the rough maverick with a checkered past who uses his free-wheeling spirit and natural brilliance to overcome the odds. What an original idea! Don't people ever get sick of seeing the same script written in different settings?Jack Nicholson plays a condescending, egotistical mysoginist (another big shocker). Demi Moore was horrible (suprise suprise) but some of the supporting cast were ok. I was hoping for more than a vehicle to show Cruise look cool and Nicholson go off on some intimidating tirade. Disappointing. I expected more from Rob Reiner."
3,"Overwrought, predictable, but decent","Does anyone ever tire of Tom Cruise's swagger? Well, here it is again. This time he's a JAG officer who has the perfect hair and the civilian clothes -- sound like ""Top Gun""? He's our break the rules and get acclaim for doing so hero! God, don't we just love him! I want to be just like Tom Cruise.The plot and script are predictable. There's lots of intense shouting and name calling perfectly orchestrated to raise the blood pressure, but this has been done before and it has been done better.Nicholson is actually better than I thought he would be. Some of the other supporting performances were good too. But the script lacks originality and falls back on some pretty standard devices.If you are looking for either a good court-room drama or a good military drama, you could find far better movies on both counts. ""A Soldier's Story"" and ""Twelve Angry Men"" are two that come to mind."
2,Over rated!,"1992 was a bad year for movies. For that reason, perhaps it is somewhat justifiable that a movie as poorly written as ""A Few Good Men"" would be nominated for best original screenplay. This movie misses it's target of ""honor over moral judgment"" at every turn. This movie could have been good but it trades intelligence for Hollywood predictability.Did anybody buy that scene where Jack Nicholson bursts out that he gave the order?This movie even actually has the audacity to cast Jack Nicholson in a movie with Kevin Pollack, (The gretest Nicholson impressionist I have ever seen.), and then allow Tom Cruise to do the movie's only Nicholson impersonation."
4,A very good movie,"I gave this movie 4 stars.I'm writing this in response to the editorial review of the movie;and all who read this.The person murdered in this movie was a marine;not a soldier.USMC=Marine,US Army=Soldier,USAF=Airman,US Navy=Sailor.Carry on."
5,Many Great Actors in a wonderful film,"Director Rob Reiner took Aaron (Sport Night, West Wing) Sorkin's play and made it a taut courtroom drama.The cast is a whos who are the great talent working today. Other than Nicholson, Cruise and Demi Moore who top line this film. You also have the acting talents of Oscar winner Cuba Gooding jr, Emmy Winner Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, ER's Noah Wyle, Best in Show writer/director Christopher Guest, J.T. Walsh, X-Men James Marshall and Kevin Pollack...A few good men indeed!Reiner put these pieces of acting talents together and makes this work in this action/adventure.You can handle the truth!~ IT IS CLASSICBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,Another 5 star movie within my movie collection,"A Few Good Men is another 5 star movie within my movie collection, reason being first off the actors in the movie, second the visuals of the camera amazing shots. Third being the script amazing lines within the movie done by all the actors the main one being Jack Nicholson the scenes being at Cuba while having lunch with the people around him and talking about ""eatting breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans trainned to kill him."" The second scene being the courtroom where he admits to ordering the code red. Not everyone will like this movie but as for myself personally it shall forever be one of my favorites in my collection because like I stated before the actors, the script, the camera visuals, and last the director not being afraid to do a movie that became one of the best movies ever drama wise in film history and still to this day stands tall among other Military Drama movies."
5,A gripping military drama,"""A Few Good Men"" is an enthralling U.S. Marines courtroom drama film. It is one of the most memorable courtroom genre pictures from the 1990s, which is attributable to Colonel Jessep's (Jack Nicholson) response to cross-examination questioning, ""You can't handle the truth!"", and the high quality of acting by Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, and Kiefer Sutherland. The narrative of the movie allows the viewer to be presented with convincing perspectives from all protagonists, and whilst it is clear who is innocent and who is guilty well before the ending, it is the substantiation of these assertions, and breaking solid testimony that keeps the viewer captivated with interest.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
1,"A courtroom drama with no causal evidence, (...)","This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I can't see any appeal about a movie where the villain admits he did it, because there really is no evidence or build up. He just says, ""I did it,"" and the movie ends. This cast may have fireworks, but the material is pure fizzle.Rob Reiner and Aaron Sorkin seem to be making a jab against those who hold truth to be on their side. But this movie doesn't really argue against anything substantive and the performances and delivery is pure stereotype.This is one of the last courtroom dramas, a genre which flourished in the 80s. I would put this film below Suspect, a Cher movie (...). LAME LAME LAME."
5,One of the Best!,"This is one of the best drama court room films I've ever seen. The actors were great and convincing, and the story well written.Along with Inherit the Wind, and Trial at Nuremberg this is up their with the best Trials I've ever seen. Very impressed."
5,Great Movie,Tom Cruse and cast do a wonderful job in this movie. When family movie night comes around this is one that will always get pulled.
4,A Few Good Men,"This film is one the more recent ""Classics"" with all actors providing stellar performances, particularly the court room action. Jack Nicholson at his very best."
3,"Good, Bad, and Yuck","Most people, in today's America, won't get what's wrong with this film. That's born out by the ratings here. Aside from the Hollywood/politically-correct/juvenille-preachiness of this film, there is some fantastic acting in scenes. I purchased this film just to watch those scenes. That's one of the great things about DVDs, you can jump over the ridiculous and go straight to the more artistic work."
1,A Few Good Men,"There was no notation on the listing of the movie prior to me purchasing the video that it would not work on this side of the country. When i put the video into the player, all i received was a error code stating that the DVD was not formatted for this area. Unfortunately, the movie is useless to us and to send it back is too much of a hassel to deal with. In all of the years that we have purchased any movies through Amazon, this has been the only time that we have experience this problem. For future purchases, it would be a wise idea to somehow list the areas of the U.S. in which the video works and areas it does not."
2,"You are entitled to your opinion, even when you are wrong.","Those are the words of my 8th grade history teacher and they fit this movie. This movie would have been rivetting if Marines were all skinheaded morons and all officers were arrogant and vicious.Sadly for Sorkin (whose hatred of reality is apparent every time he picks up a pen) and Reiner (I agree with Archie, he is a meathead) Marines aren't like that. For someone who has served, this movie was just sad. I didn't find enough legitimate reality in this movie to make me angry. I just sat and sighed. Except, of course, for the colonel, with whom I heartily agreed at pretty much every turn.I won't bother with descriptions of things that I saw or ""how it really is"". This movie is psychological drama for psych majors and bleary-eyed pacifist ninnies. If you like America or enjoyed the Marine Corps, this movie is not for you."
5,Best Court/ Military Movie of All Time!,"This movie is one of my all time favorites, and the acting is done so well in this movie that it makes the viewer feel very involved. This movie is longer than average, but it doesn't feel like because the viewer does not get lost. It based on true story, and who does not like these kind of movies? Our favorite bad guy (Jack Nicholson) is in it, Tome Cruise gives us one his greatest performances ever as a lawyer, and Kevin Bacon and Demi Moore give some fine performances as well. This movie is a better deal on DVD because you get the Widescreen and Full screen version on one disc. If you like Crimson Tide, The Firm, or Rainmaker, you will love this movie on DVD!"
3,Good Movie but not to be taken seriously,"Hollywood's ""military"" is quite different from the real deal. I served with the Marines and even though they are fanatical, we are taught to obey LAWFUL orders. Beating the crap out of a fellow Marine is hazing and is taken very seriously. When I first joined the military 18 years ago, there was some hazing and sometimes people got hurt but I never heard of any dying from it. That is a failure of leadership.The movie is entertaining but the unprofessional, cavalier attitudes of the Navy ""officers"" is not very indicative of today's Navy.Anyone who watches this and believes this is like the real Navy/Marine Corps is naive. A better depiction of old school Navy is ""Men of Honor""... but the dive community is another animal altogether!"
2,Who wrote the ending?,"This movie is pretty good until the end. The cast is excellent and Cruise and Nicholson bring a lot of charisma to the movie. But the idea that Jack Nicholson would admit that he ordered the code red is so far-fetched and absurd, this effectively destroys the movie. What the #$%$^$% were the screenwriters thinking? I'm shocked that no one in the writer's room spoke up (or maybe they did to no avail). The idea is that Cruise is such an outstanding lawyer that he gets Nicholson to essentially melt down. Puh-leeze. Surely, they could've come up with something more creative here."
5,you gotta ask me nicely,"A few Good Men and a woman, that's right you have Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, Kevin bacon & Pollak,Kiefer Sutherland,Cuba and Demi Moore,a brilliant cast WOW!Jack is riveting,Tom shines the acting is outstanding,phonomenal you don't want to miss one second of this one. A rememberably courtroom drama that will stick in your mind for years to come. Enjoy"
4,Awesome movie,I bought it as a gift for my dad. It is one of our favorite movies.. It is a great film for everyone.
4,Pretty well made,"I've used the tool a few times now, and it seems to be sturdy enough. Should last a number of years without having to be too fussy. The tool is sometimes difficult to push into the ground.I bought it to pull dandelions, and this tool probably won't do the job very well. I've read that if even a small portion of the root of the dandelion is left in the ground, it will grow back. About the only way you can get the whole root of the dandelion with this tool is if the dandelion is fairly young with a short root. Roots more than 5 inches are hard to get, though sometimes I get a root 8 inches. But that isn't often. Best to do after a rain when the ground is soft.Maybe with practice I will learn how to get more of the root, but I don't really think this is the tool to do a good job on dandelions.I've been told the only way to handle dandelions is with weed killer."
4,Satisfactory but Unimpressive,"The color is nice - you will never lose it or mistake it with someone else's. However, the seller, 1D4US, did not send me the pictured cable. The rubber part that pushes down the release is not that small bar, but rather a dome that is tough to push down. The connection is fine, however, and that's the most important part."
2,Life's a beech in Philadelphia,"Maybe it is because the opening scene seems to be making light of domestic violence ... somehow I never could warm up to this film. The dialogue is too wordy, with too many arguments between too many characters. The worst speech is when the father blames philandering on daughters. What a crock! I had to leave the room on that one. This film is nowhere near the lightheartedness of ""Bringing Up Baby."" Yuck, yuck, yuck! Get drunk, argue, have an affair. The next day everything is okay again. Surely, they can come up with better stories than that in Philadelphia (or anywhere else)."
3,Vintage Chick Flick,"The liner notes for ""The Philadelphia Story"" describes it as a sophisticated romantic comedy. Automatically my hackles go up and say ""Oh, No! Chick Flick!"" To the film's credit, it is uniformly well acted. Though Jimmy Stewart received the Oscar for his work here I thought the best performance here was delivered by Ruth Hussey as Elizabeth Embree, Stewart's no-nonsense photographer. The script is intelligently written. That said, the film at 1 hour, 52 minutes drags. There's not enough substance here to warrant that length. Translated from a stage play and it shows. The film suffers from staginess and director George Cukor didn't seem able to open the film up from it's origins. Not a complete waste of time but not the classic that it's been billed as."
5,A Bad Review????????Someone has got some problems!,"I think that The Philadelphia Story is one of the best movies EVER made. I just read a review that someone wrote, a bad review. I don't understand how someone can give this movie a bad review. What is not to love about it? Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, Ruth Hussey, Roland Young, Virgina Weilder, Mary Nash....The Perfect Cast. Some great memorable lines ""I don't want to be worshipped, I want to be loved.""WOW. The music, now this person that gave philly story a bad review said there was no music sure there was not alot but i liked what there was does anyone know what the name of the tune was that kate and jimmy was dancing to at the pond? and I loved Lydia, the tattoed lady...So Cute"
2,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"That's my main impression of ""The Philadelphia Story"", the movie that inspired ""High Society"", about a headstrong young heiress and her planned second marriage being complicated by a new suitor and an old ex-husband. I'd heard about this for years, and only ever seen that opening shot of Katharine Hepburn breaking Cary Grant's golf club. Gotta admit, it's a great shot--but it's the only good scene in the whole movie! Wow, did that ever surprise me. I thought Cary was doing a very bad job, almost like the ""Wink Cary"" I described in my review of ""That Touch of Mink"", serious autopilot. Slow-moving movie about a lot of people who think they're clever."
5,My She Was Yar,"Originally a broadway play, this film is one of my favorites. Hepburn, Grant, and Stewart are powerful triumvirate in this romantic comedy. Hepburn plays the emotionally stunted socialite while Grant is effortless in his portrayal of the easy going playboy and it's topped off with Stewart as the witty, sarcastic writer. The plot and the actors work in tandem to make this one of the most memorable films in my collection. If you want a feel-good movie then look no further than this one. There are a few bumps along the way, but what film would be complete with them?"
2,much ado about nothing.,"I love those 3 stars. Wow, what a cast.All they needed was a plot. My wife and I watched loyally for almost an hour, waiting for some substance or anything actually funny. It never happened. We walked out (turned it off).Perhaps films like this had more cultural context in their own time. But I am old enough to appreciate value in a classic setting. I just didn't see it.Very disappointed...not serious and not funny. I couldn't have cared less about those characters, beautiful though the stars certainly were. All 3 of them were badly miscast in those fluff roles."
5,Philadelphia Story with Katherine Hepburn-All time Favorite!,"Katherine Hepburn is one of my all time favorite actresses and this movie was fun, romantic and just the perfect cast of characters! ""High Society"" lacked the chemistry and humor of this version. Absolutely the best!!"
4,the philedelphia story,"this is a classic movie. Still comes on tv every now and then, but will always be worth purchasing. Katherine plays a great role, which by itself is worth the price."
5,The Philadelphia Story,"After I saw The Philadelphia Story at our local Civic Theater, I had to see the original film. It's a wonderful good old fashioned romance story and great to watch. It will completely take your mind off the cares of or present everyday living and take you back to a time when you could watch a movie and not be embarrassed by the language, content or dress. Although this is an ""oldie"", it's worth every minute of the time you spend watching it...and, of course, the acting is great! I'm glad I decided to purchase it to add to my DVD library."
5,Brillance!,You cannot say enough good things about this movie!! Cary Grant was I think snubbed for the Oscar but Jimmy Stewart well deserved it too!! Dinah (the litttle sister) is hilarious! Katharine Hepburn of course shines and her presence is what makes the movie so fantastic!
1,Picture quality horrible,"That's all I can say, just as my review headline. I was shocked at the poor quality..had I known this I would never have purchased this or the other two old flicks I purchased. I have an older set of these movies with same poor quality and thought for sure they must have upgraded the quality. Nope, terrible."
5,Star Studded Film Nails the Mark,"With a cast that includes megastars Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn a movie can do little wrong. But it isn't just using big names to draw, the film actually comes through with it's promise to be a delightful romantic/comedy. Stewart plays a snoopy reporter (ala Rear Window) who is looking for a story. Hepburn is one of Philadelphia's elite who is about to wed another of the upper-class. Stewarts only problem is that he can't get near the closed ranks of Hepburns wedding. This is where Grant comes in. Grant (playing that same ol sly, witty role he always plays but never gets tired) is Hepburns ex-husband who decides to help Stewart get into the clique. The chemistry between the three potential huge egos couldn't be better. This one is a perfect one to snuggle up and pop in for a romantic night."
5,Classic,Ther is one problem with this movie- which of the three stars outperforms the others? Cary Grant is simply Grant and the story is full of wit that draws many laughs even if you have seen this movie a dozen times.
5,Excellent movie with great acting and writing,"This is a classic and one of the best movies, with great cast and great writing. I strongly recommend it."
4,"Five-star cast, three-star script, four-star final product...","This is still a lot of fun, but it is also showing its age, nearly 70 years after it began life as a Broadway play. But Hepburn and Grant and Stewart in a romantic triangle (or a square, considering Kate's got a stuffy fiancee as well) is going to be worth seeing, even now. Many fine moments here, my favorite ones all belonging to Cary Grant. If you are a fan of any of these three legends of Hollywood, you would consider this movie a must-see."
5,Gets better with repeated viewing,"I watch this and enjoy it more now watching the interaction between Stewart and Grant. THe dialogue is brilliant - some lines rival Shakespeare, Hepburn is at her best, the jokes are fast and furious like ""Hellzapoppin,"" the supporting cast is superb, as are the clothes and decorating. Some gems ""There are rules"" - Stewart the gentleman, Hepburn's interaction with Stewart and his girlfriend, How tender everyone is with each other, the Quaker librarian, the scandal with the father and how they handle it.. the double meanings to almost every phrase. You get more each time you watch it - clearly the actors relished working with each other. This is humor at its driest."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I am not quite sure what about this story did not jibe for me. I may have to give it another go, or at least another in this series. I think it may possibly be that I never was, or never will be, a Steven Baxter fan. I suspect it is something about his style or how he writes that does not gel for me personally. Otherwise, I can't pin down what is wrong with it, but I have tried it twice and didn't finish."
1,Stephens Baxter or Stephen King,Loose ends abound in this novel. I doubt this is deliberate. It looks to this reader that the publishers have cut out a lot of what made this book make any sense. What's left is a kind of Frank Herbert (particularly nasty British horror writer) sci-fi story. What's worse is that it gets really boring towards the middle of the book and never recovers. I have read most of Stephen Baxters books and this is an extremely poor example.
2,Boring and Painful,"One of these days, I'm going to learn to never buy a book before reading the reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I was in a used book store, saw this, and bought it on the spot. What a mistake. I'm currently on page 382 of 518 and that's as far as I'm going. I'm not going to read through yet another rape, yet another child eating, yet another set of torment/torture, yet another scene of how rotten Stephen Baxter thinks mankind (and all it's various ancestral lines) is. Also, I'm tired of reading through all that stuff without any progress in the plot. Basically, I'm 74% of the way through the book, and nothing's happened to 1) re-unite the main man with the main woman, or 2) tell us who, why, or how the moon is flying through the multiverse picking up and dumping off hominids. Unless you're into being alternately bored and disgusted all while being confused, don't bother with this book."
1,No a pleasant nor enjoyable read...,"Having read many of Stephen Baxter's books I was again looking forward to this one. However it was such that I did not even bother to finish the book. Not only did the jumpiness of what existed of the plot make it difficult to read, many parts of it were just ugly - with what seemed to be no purpose.Some books may have unpleasant components in the reading, that serve a purpose to support the plot, as in The Sparrow and Children of God, where ideas served a purpose. I could not find a purpose here.Ok, so life on the red moon may be ugly... however I would have preferred to have had a foundation or reason for reading that ugliness.With over 1000 books in my collection this is not one I would recommend.John"
1,Pass...,I loved many of Baxter's other books. Waded through the first two in this series which I thought were pretty ok.Unfortunately he drops a big turd on the pages of this one. Pretty horrible stuff. I actually want to write him and ask what happened.
1,Disgusting,The story is imaginative and well written. There are too many unnecessarily disgusting and violent scenes. After the third graphic and explicit baby-murder I just couldn't read any more.
3,MUCH less than expected,"After having read several of SB's books, including both Manifold books before this (absolutely loved Time Ships and Manifold: Time/Space), I was very disappointed in this ""conclusion"" to the series. I felt it spent much too much time droning on about the various hominid species on the Red Moon with no clear improvements to the story or plot. I felt like it was more of a sequal to Longtusk.It rehashed most of the same themes...Old Ones reaching back in time to fix the universe...etc, without adding any new ideas of note. Overall, not a book I'd recommend for someone looking to read one of the best new SF writers around, Stephen Baxter!"
1,Not worth the money or time,"The first two books in this ""series"" (its really not a trilogy) are decent. Solid science, solid plot, solid storyline. However, this one is horrible and I highly recommend you spend your time doing something else.The plot is incredibly dull, and the concept is strangly familiar (can you say Planet of the Apes)?Its a shame really. Like I said, I really like his other two books in this set."
3,Tedious,Well written story of alternate universes but a slow read. I'm going to have to read some space opera now to get the taste of this out of my mind.
2,Caveman health problems,"I enjoyed the first two books of the Manifold trilogy, but this one was horrid. There is more talk about various primate digestive problems than deep sci-fi or philosophical issues. Absolutely pointless."
4,Awesome player for the price.,This is a great little mp3 player if you want to save yourself some money over the ipod or zune. It holds more than you would ever need and the battery lasts forever. Its a little hard to navigate at times but has a full fm radio and voice recorder. I use it every day for a little over and hour on my way to and home from work. I only need to charge it once a month at that rate of usage.The creative software is also very useful and has some great tools for keeping your music library sorted. The only down side in my opinion is it is confusing to navigate when you first get it and sometimes can take a while to charge to full (hour or so). But if you want to save yourself a buck and only need an mp3 player for working out or driving this is the way to go.
5,very nice!!!,"I purchased 11 of these knobs to change out the hardware in my bathroom. I love the way they look, and they seem to be a quality product."
4,A unique book on the subject,"The book was written before the internet era. Nevertheless, it was the first tentative to produce a comprehensive catalog of the genealogical resources available in Israel. Much of it is still very relevant (although not complete) ten years after its publication. It is written very clearly and is a very valuable asset for all researchers. Unfortunately, it lacks an index of towns and of names. A companion update of the addresses and phone numbers can be found online at www.isragen.org.il/BIB/JGR/jgrMain.htm"
5,My favorite story,"This is a great story. It's got something for everyone - a true who-done-it. I've listened to this cd so many times that I know which CD and which tracks to play so I can hear the incredible descriptions of the snake river and terrain of the west... Joyce Bean is awesome and easy to listed to and I just love her interpretation of Linda-Gail, you can actually picture her bouncing around in her new red hair!enjoy!"
5,Ms. Roberts Is In Her Element,"Since there have been plenty of other reviews outlining the story line in ANGELS FALL, let me just say this: when Ms. Roberts writes romantic suspense, she is truly in her element. With touches of dialogue and character development that remind me of Eve Dallas in theJ.D. Robb Box Set (In Death)series written as J.D. Robb, ANGELS FALL is a great example of a thrilling, exciting, yet romantic story that puts you right in the middle of what is going on. If you like romantic suspense, if you like action-adventure, if you like a good thriller mixed in with an engaging ""who dun it?"" mystery, you'll truly enjoy ANGELS FALL!!"
4,"Great characters, great suspense","A typically fantastic novel from Nora Roberts. The heroine is strong, but realistic. The romance is actually believable - two people who aren't entirely sure that getting together is what they want to be doing, but find themselves drawn to each other anyway. The suspense is first-rate, and I didn't figure out whodunit until the end (always a pleasant surprise).The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is because it felt strangely familiar - almost like a fourth book in the ""In The Garden"" trilogy. Slightly damaged young woman arrives in new home, where she gets support and encouragement from a strong older woman. Quirky locals are met, friends are made, not-quite-normal goings on and romance ensue. I'd like to see Nora move away from this mold a bit further; from the descriptions I've read of the upcoming ""Morrigan's Cross"", that series will hopefully be more of a departure."
1,This Angel Fell Flat,"Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition. Set as a kind of ""Rockies Rear Window,"" this is one slow story. Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through. Finally skipped ahead to finish the book. I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :( If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend. Not worth the price."
4,Angels Fall,"Another one of Nora Roberts' suspense books, with a bit of humor, that was difficult to put down. As usual, very well written and a page turner. I figured out ""who dun it"" before the end, but had to read on to find out how this person was finally caught."
2,Predictable,"This story was very lame and very predictable. Come on Nora, can't you come up with something new? The man is always handsome in a rugged sort of way, the woman is always beautiful, but maybe a bit thin. They usually hate each other at the beginning, or try to one-up each other in being the biggest smartass. Puleeze. And the sex scenes are always the same. The characters were totally unappealing. Particularly Reece. She certainly thinks the world revolves around herself. I would love for once, for a character such as Reece to be wrong, at least about one thing or another, or that the story's ""couple"" would go their separate ways at the end."
2,Memory lapse,"How good was this book???? I don't even remember the story line. I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable. Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me."
5,Nora Roberts does it again.,"I really enjoyed this novel from Nora Roberts...she rarely disappoints me. I liked the main characters, althought I will admit I didn't like Brody in the beginning of the book but came of enjoy him by the end.I also liked Reece's character becasue she was trying so hard to get past her trauma but just couldn't get a handle on it.Now I will admit I guessed the killer in the beginning of the book but it didn't take away from the story at all because I enjoyed the characters. Nora has a way of making you want to know more about all of her characters."
3,I wish I would have just waited until it came out in paperback...,"Ok, I must admit that I am more of a reader of suspense novels than I am romance. This possibly could have effected my opinion of this book. However, I feel like Nora can do a lot better than this. The whole issue with no one in the town believing the main character about the murder she saw got REALLY old. The perfect Nora Roberts book has just the right balance of romance and suspense. I feel that this one had too much romance and not enough suspenseful action to keep the pages turning."
3,I was engaged,"I don't remember the last time I was engaged by Nora Roberts, so it is remarkable enough. But the book was good, too. And since I won't spoil anything that is about all I'm going to say.Still, she offered us tactile, believable, respectful representations of people, men and women alike.I recommend it."
3,Get a new research assistant...,"NewBERRY Street in Boston? Where's that? Though thousands get it wrong (I did Google search and got 485,000 hits for Newberry St Boston) so why should Nora get it right?As far as the book goes, well, I skipped to the end to see who bad guy was before I could continue reading it. Some days I just don't need the suspense. It would have been nice if this had come out in paperback and not hardcover. Mass killings too. Enough of that in the world too. Could have been worse though - could have had a fairy in it or a witch. I did finish it though so I'll give it three stars.I think the point of the seemingly nasty hero with a heart of gold was that the heroine had enough well meaning people in her life that she needed ultra strong dose of the opposite. It helped her stay grounded in the real world."
3,From a Christian,"Angel Falls is a page-turner; a well-spun romantic mystery that had me spellbound. Nora Roberts is a gifted author who could have written this same book without the illicit sex between Reece and Brody. They were in bed together before their second date. How much more meaningful and sweeter the story had Miss Roberts left out the writhing and lust between two unmarried people.Call me old-fashioned, but I gave away the only other Nora Roberts book I had (unread as yet) because I was pretty sure I would find more ""if it feels good, do it"" fare. Such a shame that such a talented author feels she needs the crutch of unmarried sex to sell a book.....I would have enjoyed this book twice as much without that element. In fact, I feel guilty for having finished it..."
4,Nora Creates another Marvelous Tale,"Nora Roberts' books have always got my attention and Angel Falls is another marvelous tale by this author. There are numerous reviews that detail the story so I'll be brief. The story follows Reece Gilmore's journey to escape reality from the east coast by settling in a far away town of Angel's Fist, Wyoming. While hiking in Montana she witnesses a murder and has a hard time convincing people that she actually did witness this crime. Then she finds a believer: his name is Brody and the pace and suspense begins in the story.Although the story line is rather predictable, it was still a wonderful story. Also, Ms. Roberts writing of the descriptive scenes of Wyoming and Montana was wonderful and almost made me want to take a trip there to see these beautiful states. Maybe some day."
5,Just like the old days! TERRIFIC!,"I am so pleased to report that the old Nora Roberts is back!! This book was a delight with great characters and great suspense. And nothing too terrifying/creepy like some of her books. Honestly, I have not really enjoyed her releases over the past 2-3 years, but I got hopeful when I saw good ratings on Amazon.Reece is traveling the country, trying to redefine herself after witnessing a terrible crime. She ends up in a small town in Wyoming with a resident good-looking, reclusive author (of course). There are a lot of charming characters, and the story keeps you guessing until the end. The romance is great... like the old days. You really find yourself caring about Reece and Brody.Great Job, Nora!!!! I look forward to more like this!"
4,One of her better books,"In Angel Falls Nora Roberts does what she does best, creating a world of believeable characters and making you care about them. The balance between mystery and romance is just about perfect, and one of the things that I especially liked is that her hero seemed real, he wasn't gushing over the heroine but was more of a typical guy. The mystery and restaurant world was also very well done and engaging. This is the type of Nora story I enjoy most, not the ones with paranormal elements that she has done so many of lately. I look forward to more stories like this."
4,Roberts in top form,"This is Nora Roberts in top form--she spends enough time on the central characters and the plot isn't bogged down by two many romances. The central mystery--rarely her best point outside of the J.D. Robb books anymore--is decent enough to keep you turning the pages. But here, without the mysticism I have found so annoying in her recent trilogies, she tells the story of a woman coming back from a trauma in a believable way. Her dialogue and characterization is the best there is in the romantic suspense genre. I'm not disappointed that I bought this one in hardback."
2,"Repetition, repetition, repetition","Is it really just me? does anyone else notice that Nora Roberts books seem to follow a pattern. i bought this book and crossed my fingers hoping that it would be different from the other series i have read by her, but .....i was disappointed. this was a different story, different plot, different characters, with different names, but the story line was the same. the main characters were essential the same as other characters she has written in her other series. i feel that Roberts has been operating from a formula to write her last few books and im just waiting for some originality."
3,pretty slow,"First time reading a Nora Roberts book and I have to say, I'm not real impressed. People tell me that she writes great books, well not this one."
4,Good Pacing and Plot,"I liked this much better than Blue Smoke. I am getting tired of all the violence in her stories, but this one was not as graphic and disturbing as some of her other stories.The book kept me fairly engaged. It was a pretty easy read, I read it in under 20 hours but there were some memorable characters. I could see some of her previous characters in the current ones. (Reece reminded me a lot of Nell in Dance Upon the Air etc) but all in all I was fairly entertained. The development between Reece and Brody was good and believable. I will probably buy this when it comes out in paperback."
4,Great Except for the Love Interest,"This was a great mystery and had a likable leading lady. I felt the leading man was not what she deserved. That took a little bit from the story for me, however, after saying that, I have to admit this story was a very enjoyable read with a thrilling plot. I enjoy mysteries so I enjoyed this book. And while I'm at it a few others that I enjoyed also this year are Enchanted from Nancy Madore and Can't Wait To Get To Heaven from Fannie Flag."
3,Angels Fall was just ok...,"I have to say I was disappointed in Angels Fall. I've read other Nora Roberts (and J.D. Robb) books and in comparison, this one really dragged; I had to fight my way through to finish it. The suspense picked up when they found who the murdered woman was and started to put the pieces together. Overall, rather predictable and not so exciting. I'm glad to be finished with this one..."
4,"A GREAT STORY, SLOWER PACED THAN USUAL","As always, the character development and scenery descriptions were done to perfection. Reece's mental state beautifully detailed. My intention was to read the book before the end of January's Lifetime movie premiere. Wonderful casting Heather Locklear as Reece."
5,A terrific book,"Nora Roberts does it better than anyone! Her books have a proven theme. A central character who starts a new life, and just finds the right person. There is suspense here, and she keeps you guessing."
3,"An okay read, but pretty predictable","I've enjoyed a great deal of novels with NR's name on the cover, but it's getting to the point now where when I pick up the latest published book for this author, that I feel like Forest Gump with that box of chocolates. You just never know what you're going to get. This book will give the reader a great deal of knowledge about food, that's for sure. It's not one of the better novels that has come out with NR's spectacular and eye-catching book cover, but it was an okay read. For certain, I've claimed to be a reader that could recognize NR's style of writing about anywhere, but I won't claim to be able to do that any more. After all the reviews written before mine, I see no reason to go into describing the characters or plot of this novel. I bought the book, I'll add it to my library which contains many of NR's novels, but I won't read it again because I'll remember it as being just what I thought it to be, an ""okay read""."
5,perfect,"great book. heavy and light, solid and sensual all at the same time. the characters were flawed, which made them perfect, and the storyline and ending is perfect for those looking to curl up by the fire with a cup of tea and allow the night to slip from beneath them."
2,Could it have been worse??? MAYBE...,"I forced myself to finish reading it becasue I wanted to see where it would go and if it got better. It started good and I started thinking ..... ""Chalk another up for Nora"" but then is drug on and on and on. What should have been a 300 page story -MAX turned into 430+. I did not like Brody, his sarcasm annoyed me. Reese was okay but I didn't close the book liking her much. I think that the most interesting part of the book was the mind games that were being played on her."
4,a pretty good read....,not really sure about this book...its an overall pretty good read.....it was the first book of hers i had read......more than likely i will purchase another......overall a good read
5,I didn't want the book to end...,"I'm a great fan of NR and I was not disappointed. I've liked everything about this book, and wanted to remain as long as possible with Reece, Brody, Joanie, Linda-gail et co. Sorry to see it end, since I've spent so many pleasurable hours reading it."
2,Poor reading.,"I must say, this novel intrigued me. I could tell instantly there was going to be so many bright colors in the objects and surroundings of the storyline. Nora Roberts always seems to detail her stories with tons of rivetting color. The beginning of the book almost reminded me of the other nature-tastic book she wrote, Rivers End.The plot is poor I found as I continued reading. The fear and mystery is poor. The romance is debateable. The only thing that seems real are the feelings of paranoia the main character deals with, and the wanting to escape. She wants to get away. Keep moving and get away from the past.I think the novel could have been better had Nora added some elements of deeper relationships instead of moving the plot around so much. It seemed confusing, and eventually uninteresting. Sadly, I will be getting rid of this one. It is not worth holding onto for my keeper shelf."
3,Not sure yet,I haven't had time to read the book yet but I loved the movie with LeAnn Rimes so I figured I would enjoy reading the book as well.
3,Wait For The Paperback,"Too long, too predictable and I'm getting tired of shelling out bucks for a hardcover that should have been better. The villain is readily apparent, the romance is so-so and the weather sucks! If you must read it, wait until it comes out in paperback."
3,Angels Fall,I was disappointed with this book. It is honestly the first time I've ever been disappointed in a Nora Roberts book. It was slow and the heroine was not particulary personable even though they story tried to make her special. I can't say I want to go to Angel Falls.
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this book. There is no soul in the characters, plot and location. It was flat. I expected something better from Nora Roberts than this boring, flat storyline. In fact, I would give this book 1/2 star it was so boring. The next time, I will not be racing out to buy a new Nora Roberts hard cover book. This book is as flat and boring as Blue Smoke was. Save your money and wait for the paperback."
4,Angel Falls,"The movie was good, but the book was better. Not Nora's best work but definitely worth the read."
5,1st 5 star,"""Angels Fall"" was my first Fiction read by Nora Roberts. I would call it captivating; I couldn't put it down. I was able to watch the movie as well and felt that it was a great performance all around."
5,One of the best Nora Roberts yet!,"After discovering Nora Roberts and reading a few of her hardbacks and trying to make it through one very bad mass market paperback that I ended up returning to the library, this one was the best. I did not want to put it down. I had no idea who the villain was until the next to the last chapter, just before it was revealed in the book. This was excellent and had me wondering if she just had a bad spell when she wrote Blithe Images. I'm looking forward to reading more of her novels."
3,NOT worth your $$$,"Nora Roberts was really phoning-it-in on this novel! The main characters are incredibly annoying, the dialogue is stilted and exactly the same for every character, the mystery was improbable, and the villain made no sense.So...you have been warned."
2,Flat,I couldn't get past page 60. This book could've been suspenseful. It should've begun on the day that her happy culinary career was shattered by an armed robbery. For additional drama we could have been with the heroine when she decides to chuck her past life and take off across country in her old car. Instead the book begins when she has been drifting around for quite some time and her car breaks down at Angels Fist. We are shown how paranoid and jittery she is- which is more irritating than anything. The dramatic events that made her this way are related in an offhand background narrative. The story is too flat without hooks to pull in the reader. This is the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it may be the last. I like more suspense in my suspense.
4,Nice,"Loved the suspense, mystery and love story. Would recommend this book. Wish I was at that location. Love the mountains."
5,Great psychological thriller and romance,"I loved it. The leading male character, Brody, was my absolute favorite; simply very attractive. I enjoyed the interactions and romance between Reese and Brody and how their relationship grew. The suspense plot was a little predictable, but the psycho-thriller elements, involving Reese's past incident, her trauma, the current murder mystery, her psychological victimization, and her struggle, were fantastic."
2,sorry,"bram stoker is most famous for dracula. not hard to believe. some of the stories here have even a dull plot. but mostly the problem is that stoker dwells at completely irrelevant things, like melodramatic dialogues going on and on, the building of friendship, etc. he could have done better, he is a good enough writer. but he has a melodramatic string, which destroys. the judge's house is the only story really worth reading."
3,I can continue my B-24 build,"I bought this for stabilizer servos. I am building a 1/12 scale B-24 Liberator and need about 3' servo extensions. With this, I can make extensions any length."
2,Not Worth It for Cold Coffee,"This coffee maker only makes decent ""To Go"" coffee. For home use, its not practical. You might as well get a regular coffee maker and pour what you want into a travel mug. The coffee is never quite hot enough and makes bland coffee. I've tried it with several types of coffee grind and still same blandness. It might be due to the amount of coffee grind you put into the machine since its only for brewing 1-2 servings."
1,Smelly Coffee!!,I bought this unit as a Christmas present and have been using it since 12-30-2005. Followed the manufacturer's recommend. on first time cleaning/etc. First cup of brewed coffee tasted and smelled like plastic ;-( Cleaned unit again with white vinegar and smell lessened a bit. Coninued to use unit with hopes that smell would go away completely but just the other day it came back worse! Wrote Hamilton Beach to see what they can do for me.
2,Shouldn't be this hard to brew coffee!,"I bought this coffee maker for my newly retired father, thinking he could enjoy his morning coffee all morning. He's an expert with all things electronic, so when he told me he was having problems with the coffee coming out all over the counter, I knew I'd be returning this item. I did a ton of research, trying to find a thermal coffee maker that works properly...this one got the best ratings. My father tried to use this machine for at least a week, and no matter what he did, the coffee went all over the counter. He's a smart guy, so ""operator error"" wasn't the problem.Suggestion: Make it easy on yourself, buy a Black & Decker coffee maker with a regular pot, and buy a nice thermal carafe to pour it in when it's done brewing. It's an extra step, but much less complicated. Hope this helps someone."
1,HORRIBLE taste!!!,"We were so excited to get this coffee maker. The whole concept with the to go mugs thrilled us. We got home, cleaned it out and started brewing and WHOA! Talk about horrible...it tasted bitter, rancid, undrinkable. We thought maybe it was the coffee so we bought more..twice we bought more and the same bad taste.Finally went online to see tons of people had the same problem. Something with the rubber tubing inside. When you open up the compartment where you put the water and smell down inside it you can smell the bad taste that is brewed into your coffee.Needless to say it went back to the store. So disapointed...it really was what we wanted but it didn't work out."
2,Looks Good .... and that's about it.,"1. Coffee does not stay hot for very long ... 2 hours tops ...stays warm for a while!2. Glass lined Thermal Carafe .... exploded after 1 month.3. No pause and serve .... if cups are not placed EXACTLY in the right spot, coffee pours EVERYWHERE!4. Very user UN-friendly water reserve. Have to look into the reservior from above (wife is too short ... always miss measures!).ONLY positive .... makes good tasting coffee ... but how hard is that!That's about enough!"
3,Nothing Special,"Looks great. Works with no problem, BUT.... I have to use much more coffee to get the same strength as my previous coffee maker, AND... The thermal pot does not keep the coffee hot for very long. After an hour and a half it needs to be heated up, which kind of defeats the purpose of the thermal caraf.My biggest disappointment was to check Consumer Reports (consumerreports.org) on their ratings of this type of product, and this is their top choice.Anyhow, both my wife and I are disappointed with the performance of the product."
4,I like it!,"Great coffee maker. The coffee is VERY hot, hotter than other coffee makers I have had. I don't find that I need to fill the carafe with hot water first as the instructions recommend. After the first pot the plastic/rubber taste others have noted dissappeared and now the coffee tastes great. My only issue is the design of the to go cups is not the best. The wide lip at the top is a bit unusual and a bit difficult to drink from but not overly difficult. All in all I really like the coffee maker."
1,Completely junk after 10 months & bad customer service to boot!,"We received this ""lemon"" of a coffee maker as a Christmas gift last year. It leaks all over the place, the lines clog up very easily and, after 10 months, the timer unit has filled with condensation so that the automatic funtion does not work at all. When I called their customer service, they wouldn't honor the warranty because we don't have a receipt (it was a Christmas Gift!) even though they can tell from the manufacture date that it went into the stores as Christmas merchandise. Their response is that we drive it to their service center an hour away or we can send it to them to be looked at-which will take at least 6-8 weeks. What horrible customer service and a coffee maker of this price point should certainly last more than ten months!Bottom line: this product is junk!"
1,Horrible taste,"After following the manufacturer's directions for cleaning as well as using a generic cleaning solution, the coffee STILL has a plastic rubbery taste. You can smell the terrible taste in the water reservoir. Even the travel cups have the same smell to them.Don't buy this unit!!"
1,No longer works,"I also have the problem where the machine shuts off after 3 seconds. It's essentially useless now and the warranty period has ended.Even when the machine worked, it wasn't that great."
2,not a good buy,"I bought this coffee maker for the thermal carafe and the two mugs. I didn't do enough reading about it, and I now regret that. I have washed the mugs several times, SOAKED them in vinegar, and they STILL taste horrible! The coffee does taste fine to me in any other mugs I own(I filter all my water so I didn't use their filter).I was a bit skeptical when I went to brew a single cup of coffee, and I put the mug under the filter basket. First, I thought the coffee would certainly come out of the filter basket and miss the mug entirely. It did not however, but that is when I realized that you cannot remove the carafe while the coffee is brewing to pour a cup, there is not stopper and it will keep on dripping out of the machine onto your counter.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
1,Great idea--poor implementation,I received this coffee maker as a Christmas gift and was very excited thinking it would be very convenient. I've been very disappointed however. The very first time I used it I thought it was broken because all I could see in the time display was 8888. Finally I realized you have to bend down and get on eye level with the display before you can read the numbers--is that bad design or what? Didn't they ever try using this coffee maker after they designed it? Then I made my first pot of coffee and it was very weak. I finally realized that I need to use nearly double the amount of coffee to make the same strength coffee as I did in my old Mr. Coffee coffee maker. Instead of being very convenient this coffee maker has been very annoying.
1,Poor Quality,"The carafe fits very tight onto the maker. When removing the carafe, you must hold onto the unit to get it out. It takes two hands to remove the carafe! The commuter mugs have large opening that readily spill the coffee with any movement. For a quality product, these mugs should have the slide closures to prevent the coffee from spilling."
1,The designer of the pot itself - needs to be fired.,"I can't believe this would pass R&D.; If I could give it a 0 star rating - I would.EVERY time you pour a cup of coffee, (no matter how hard you try) coffee drips down the front of the pot and all over what ever you are pouring over.You seriously have to pour your coffee over the sink everytime you pour a cup.Horrible, horrible design."
1,Junk not worth buying,"I'll make this brief...first time washing the travel mugs, the cups separated into two pieces. The Carafe as others ave mentioned drips, which is so bad you have to pour over the sink to catch the mess. Now after a month of use, the display is failing. Life is too short to put up with an annoying machine like this."
2,Cumbersome,"Caraffe is big and unweildy. Coffee doesn't stay any warmer than my old coffee maker. Really liked the way it looked on the counter, but good looks don't carry the coffee drinking experience."
2,WARNING: carafe is very temperature sensitive!!,"My husband and I bought this coffee maker because we had recently broken 4 glass coffee carafes while washing them--by accidentally banging them into the faucet or the side of the sink. So when we saw the stainless steel carafe we thought we were set--this would be the last coffee maker we would have to buy. Little did we know that inside the stainless steel outer layer of the carafe is a very thin glass container (it looks like metal when you look inside the carafe--but trust me--it is glass). Since the glass liner of the carafe is very thin it is also very sensitive to heat changes, so when we rinsed it out after brewing coffee (I guess the water was too cool and the pot was too hot) the inside of the carafe exploded. At least the coffee maker came with 2 mugs that it can brew into, so it is not totally useless."
1,YUCK!,"This makes the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. As mentioned in another review, the coffee tastes like burnt rubber - and funny enough, if you look inside the reservoir, you will see that the intake hose is made out of pink raw rubber! The inside of the resevoir smells very strongly of raw rubber as well. And that is the taste that goes into the coffee - YUCK!!!! We are returning ours today."
1,Hamilton Beach Thermal Carafe coffee tastes bad,"I recently purchased a Hamilton Beach Thermal Carafe coffee maker. The coffee has a chemical aftertaste-it tastes like new plastic. In addition, the coffee is very weak- as it brews, it pours through the filter at one speed (rapid). I have seen other models make stronger coffee with a setting- made by the user - to control the rate of water flow through the filter."
3,Be Careful,"I have owned this unit for 2 months with none of the problems that I have seen in other reviews, until today. While cleaning the caraffe the bottom blew out of it and it exploded, sending tiny glass shards all over the place. I was very disappointed as it has been a great unit overall and you can not get replacement caraffes for it. I would be leary of buying the same model because of this...what if there had been hot coffee in it?"
1,Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Coffee Maker with Thermal Carafe and Two Travel Mugs,"Would not advise purchase of this product. This Coffee Maker model DID NOT brew ""HOT"" Coffee. Carafe DID NOT keep (""WARM"") Coffee brewed warm for more than a half hour. I called Coffee Maker, Hamilton Beach Customer Service and was asked to ship Coffee Maker to them for service/replacement. I did send Coffee Maker just before Labor Day Holiday, have not been contacted or received serviced/replacement yet. Although Hamilton Beach assured me a Coffee Maker that brewed ""HOT"" Coffee would be mailed back within 24 to 36 hours, I have not yet received a serviced/replacement Coffee Maker. I like my coffee brewed ""HOT"" and want the coffee to stay hot longer than a half hour in the thermal carafe after brewing, so I purchased a Coffee Maker with a Thermal Carafe from another maker."
4,Great value.,"I've been using mine for almost three months. Preheating the carafe with tap water, it coffee stays quite hot for a couple hours, and drinkably hot for three or four hours. Yes, it does drip when one takes the lid off and tries for that last half a mug of coffee, but so what? (By the time it gets down to that point, the coffee is lukewarm anyway.)It goes without saying that the coffee is not boiling hot, like a French press/plung pot, but that is the price one pays with any drip.I mostly purchased this unit because of the versatility in brewing options, and they have proved quite useful. When one considers that the Thermos mugs alone cost $20 each, the price point isn't bad at all.I was surprised to learn the Hamilton Beach and Proctor Silex are essentially the same company; had I know that, I probably wouldn't have bought this pot, but I'm glad I did. The only thing that probably does better in the thermal carafe market is a Capresso, which doesn't have the travel mugs."
2,You can have mine!,"This is the most disappointing coffeemaker I have ever owned! First off, I like my coffee a bit stronger, and it can barely accomodate the extra grounds.Second,it spits and sprews and steams like it's working for all it's worth. Third, the coffee never tastes good. It always has a bitter quality to it. The water runs in too fast I think. I called Hamilton Beach because all it did was steam one month after I bought it. They sent me a chemical to run through it; said it was probably clogged. This BTW was even after I ran the vinegar treatment through it 3 times in the first month. I have since retired this unit that cost me $45.00 new. I am using a little 4 cup Black & Decker that cost $12.00 and I am much happier. Anyone want my Hamilton Beach? I'll sell it cheap!"
5,Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Coffee maker,I love my Hamilton Beach coffee maker. I have had it for about one trouble free year. It brews good coffee on time and fast!The price is half of what I would expect to pay for a auto coffee maker. It has been one of the best coffee makers I have had. I just ordered another one for a gift.
3,broken in less than one month,"Absolutely loved this machine for the first few weeks, but then it just stopped brewing coffee. It will brew for about three seconds and then shut off, and it will not restart. I am going to try one more since it may just be defective. It did a good job otherwise. Coffee brews very hot and stays that way for quite a long time. It's convenient to be able to brew into one or two mugs, or the carafe. I do agree with the other review about the inconvenient opening for the water, but it wasn't a really big issue."
4,It's a great coffee maker,"I got this coffee maker for Christmas and I love it. After brewing 40 pots of coffee, the coffee still tastes great. The coffee stays fresh and hot for a couple hours. With proper cleaning and maintance, the coffee will always be fresh. I run white vinegar through the coffee maker once a month and i rinse the pot with hot water and baking soda at least once a week.A few criticisms...I wish the coffee pot had a higher capacity and the the opening was bigger so it would be easier to clean. The travel mugs that are included are okay. Once you get towards the bottom of the cup, the coffee comes through the top irregularly when trying to drink and overflows easily"
4,NOT SO HOT,"THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS THE TEMPERATURE. THE CARAFE,EVEN WITH HOT WATER PREHEATING, DOES NOT KEEP COFFEE WARM FOR MORE THAN A HALF HOUR. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO AVOID THE 'BURNT' COFFEE TASTE OF REGULAR COFFEE MAKERS BUT FIND MYSELF HAVING TO 'ZAP' THE LAST CUP IN MICROWAVE OR THROW IT OUT."
2,Coffee Maker totally sux!,"1.Its hard to pour the water into the unit, without making a mess. (always have to clean up mess)2. It Drips, and it drips badly, especially while pouring your coffee (mess #2 to clean up)3. It doesn't have the pause feature.I am throwin mine in the trash where it belongs, and goin back to black and deckers coffee maker."
2,not for the regular coffee drinker,"First of all this coffee maker was expensive, then you cannot leave the lid on & use it for it's primary function as a carafe because it does not run into the hole on the lid as indicated in the instructions but overflows. Then at least 1 time a week the coffee maker over flows (dont know why, I make coffee the same way every day) leaving boiling hot grounds and coffee with grounds in it, not salvagable even until the next pot is ready. No matter what I tried I hate this coffee maker, although it is working I am getting a new one."
2,No built for the long haul,"After two years, this product stopped warming the water to the appropriate temperature and does not force the water through the ground at the proper speed, resulting in crappy coffee. We liked the package and the price and it made good coffee in the past but after two years, we are looking elsewhere from Hamilton-Beach products."
1,Horrible Plastic Taste & Smell,"Giancarlo is dead-on with his complaint of rubbery smell & taste of the coffee. I thought we had a bad carafe and returned it to the manufacturer. They were great - sent me a new one right away - but still same horrible taste & smell. I'm wondering if his new hose fixed the problem - if not, I'll be shelling out $100 for a new coffee maker - this stuff is undrinkable and I'm no coffee connoisseur."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"Hot Coffee - yesFast - yesPain - yesHeavy - yesHard to put carafe in - yesDoes not hold enough coffee - yesCant put carafe back if lid not screwed back - yesYou have to turn carafe completely over to get coffee out - yesHoles in cup to close to center so when you go to drink coffee builds up so when it hits the holes it is the good morning hot as hell coffee shower - yesDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUY THE SAME THING FROM MR.COFFEE FOR $20 AND TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THE MOVIES!"
3,Christo/Jeanne Claude Art,This item is a gift. I have not opened and examined it fully.It appears to be as advertised but I can't give you definitive review now.
5,Excellent,This Tee is comfortable and durable. The tee-shirt feel is better than the more slick sateen feel of previous shirts and is more durable as well. I'm ordering more of these very soon!
5,Great Read for All!,"""The Simple Touch of Fate"" is a winner. I fell in love with this book. It is reality in a new light. People look at their own lives a little differently after reading this. It gives hope and inspiration a new twist. From Desert Storm to 9-11 and beyond, you will read real life drama at its best.Now listen up all you guys, before you go thinking, ahh, another girly book, I want you to know there are many male contributors to this book, war heroes even, so please don't blow it off.Judy Bridges, Columnist for; "" The Stump"" Literary Magazine"
5,Fate or Coincidence,"Tingles down my back at every story told me this was an inspiring book. Fate and how it plays a part in everyone's life, both young and old, is what makes this book fascinating reading. From the nurse who stayed late to meet a special patient to the train not taken, many wonderful awe-filled stories show us we are not alone in the world, but maybe part of a bigger design. Enjoy your journey down Fate's unending road. I applaud the author's efforts and can't wait for the next in the series. Susan Schwartz, Writer & Book Reviewer"
3,cute! nice everyday ring,"Very simple design. Extremely light and thin-feeling, but there's no high risk of breaking it since there's no parts extending off this ring."
2,Too hard to keep clean!,"This chair certainly has some great features - comfort, adjustable heights, recline, folding, etc. However, it's so hard to keep clean! Cloth is simply a bad idea for a high chair - it literally has to be washed daily. For a particularly messy meal, you're out of luck for the next meal. But, even worse are the straps! the lower strap cannot be removed and since it's in the lap area gets FILTHY. there is virtually no way to clean it. the upper straps can be removed if you have a ton of time and patience. Overall, not a great design for something that gets used so often in such a messy context!"
3,Mixed emotions,"Love the highchair for its ease of use, but I have to agree with the negative comments about keeping the seat clean. I would like to buy the Healthy care Aquarium high chair, but for now I am just searching for a vinyl high chair cover to replace the cloth one."
2,Tray too high,"I registered for this because of the great reviews both here and in the baby bargains book, but my daughter barely cleared the tray while sitting in the seat- so I had to use an inexpensive booster seat. She is now one, and still, the tray is very high for her and she is constantly needing a boost up."
2,Pros and Cons,"We registered for this chair because it seemed to have great features. We like the looks, the removable tray insert, the wheels and the reclining seat.However, there are a couple of big negatives. The tray comes up too high. Also, the way the seat is designed, it allows and even encourages slouching! It also does not bring my son close enough to the tray. I would not recommend this seat!"
3,I really hate this highchair,"We bought this chair because it had a great color scheme and seemed like a really nice chair in the store. The tray sits way to high and my 9 month old has figured out how to remove the removable tray. It says ""machine washable"" but it starts to fall apart after the second wash. It is not easily wiped down and the cover is a pain to remove. Also,the tray does not slide on and off very easily. I wish I would have picked the aquarium high chair instead."
3,"Cute, but not as practical as I had hoped.","We purchased this chair when my daughter was five months old. She seems quite comfortable in it, however we have 3 major problems with it:1.) The tray is much to high for her to be able to eat off of it. (It's in the closet for now until she grows).2.) The five point harness is way to big for her and it literally hangs off of her and she ends up grabbing the straps and biting and sucking on them like a teether (Gross and really unsafe). The harness's lack of support causes a slouching issue as well.3.) Finally, the cleaning issue is a hassle as others have written. I haven't had it long enough for it to clump up, but I can tell already that it will be a challenge to keep clean.Overall, I think my daughter is more comfortable in this chair than other models, but I'm not sure that I would have bought it had I known all of the practicality drawbacks."
2,Great until your baby actually starts to eat food...,"I really loved this chair for the first few months. Because it reclines and has straps, we were able to put our daughter in the chair to join us at the table starting at three months. I was very happy she could be a part of the family dinner time, she could observe all that was going on and be at our level which I feel was important. However, she was not eating food then, so I had no real clean up. Now at 12 months, we both dread this chair. I have to agree with others, the chair cushion clumped after washing and it's no longer comfortable. There are so many nooks and crannies, I literally wheel the chair outside after every meal and hose it down. Especially in the foot rest area. The straps are caked with food. I don't think a Mom was consulted when designing this chair. Thirty dollars plus shipping for a second cover, that will probably also bunch up after washing. When it's time for baby to eat, this chair just doesn't perform."
2,Wouldn't buy this again,"I agree with alot of the reviews- the seat bunches up after one wash (and hung dry). It's so frustrating. The stitching has also started coming undone after maybe 5 washes. I emailed the company who said they would send me a replacement ""this time"" (like it was my fault it's bunching up). When I asked about how to prevent this, the customer service rep said to not put it in the washing machine. My daughter can cover the seat with baby food in one sitting. I bought it specifically so I could put it in the washing machine. I am very disappointed in this highchair. I would definitely NOT recommend this chair for anybody who wants to wash the cover."
4,I love it!,"This high chair is amazing! First of all, everything is machine washable or dishwasher safe (except for the frame, of course). It reclines almost all the way, to a very relaxed position, which makes it comfortable for her to hang out in, or helps the food stay in the mouth better (especially during the 'learning to eat' period). The height adjusts so that they can accompany you at your dining table, or a picnic (or Asian style meal). The tray slides off and on very easily, but it honestly doesn't fit in my dishwasher, which happens to be pretty large. It is very padded and has a 5 point harness, and it easily folds up if you want to store it against a wall! So not only is it comfortable, it is extremely safe, practical, and functional. Plus, it is has very neutral tones that go with most decor, but has a nice pattern that hides stains well. If the tray would fit in my dishwasher I think it would be, by far, the best high chair on the market!"
3,A little big for baby,"I haven't had the same complaints other reviewers mentioned, but I do agree the thing is huge. My daughter is 14 lbs, and the chair swallows her up! Plus, the safety harness-- which is a great idea-- is set on it's smallest adjustment, and it is still to big. I mean, I know it isn't supposed to be snug like the car seat, but the straps are falling off her. And it took me forever to figure out how to get the tray on and off-- I know that was just me, but for whatever reason I just couldn't figure it out."
2,Below Average,"I agree with all the comments about the chair tilting, lack of customer service and the chair pad wadding up. Our chair leans to one side but we can't figure out how to fix it (assuming it's fixable). Also, I have tried to order a replacement cushion through Babytrend. Their website shows most of the seat covers as out of stock except 2, one vinyl and one cloth. When I tried to buy the only cloth one, nothing would add to my cart. So, I called them and was told that they were out of stock and I could try back in a month or two! Huh???? How is any reputable business out of stock for that long? And what am I supposed to do until then? All in all, this chair is not worth it -- I'll buy a new chair and tell everyone I know about my experience. There are too many other goods ones out there to choose from."
3,Good highchair but tray tough to move one-handed,This is a very nice highchair with many features of the more expensive models. It also has a neutral design to go with any decor. I have not used it yet with my 3 month old but had my sisters 15 month old here for a week and she used the chair. I was a little worried that the seat cover might stain since it is a cloth-like material or have to be machine washed to be cleaned. It did clean up strawberry stains fine with scrubbing with a wet rag. The only issue is that the tray is hard to slide in and out with one hand. My sister and brother-in-law both also commented about that. It seems to stick some. I'm not sure yet if that will improve over time.
2,Great comfy highchair but not practicle for messy baby,"After reading all the reviews, I immediately put this highchair on my baby registry. It looks great, has all the wonderful features everyone says and is very comfortable. The tray and the cloth padding are easy to wash BUT not the seatbelt. The safety bar that goes between the legs can't be removed easily. When my baby got older, she got messier and there was always food stuck on the belts or in the creases. When she was 15 months old, we bought a plastic one for under $18. I wash that all the time. I will get another plastic one for my second baby."
3,A Low High Chair,"We just ordered this item from on-line and I am discouraged to see how low it sits at the highest setting. It is not convenient for us because we usually eat at a high table in the kitchen. I assumed it would be high enough. I am only 5'4'' and the tray comes about 5-6 inches below my hip. Why is it so low? Great for the dining room table, but not comfortable for the kitchen table. It also is a bit of a stretch to feed her if I am standing (as I often do). I called ToysRus to attmept to exchange it, but was told I will have to do it on line since Toys and BabiesRus are now seperate - what a pain in the neck!"
1,Baby sits way too low for this chair,"We tried this with two kids and it didn't work out for either. Even though our kids are tall for their age - very tall - they sat so low that the tray was up to their armpits. It's easy to clean and store, and quite sturdy, but useless given the fit."
3,Do not recommend,"The size of the chair is very odd. Our 8 month old is swimming in it. He sits very low and far back. We had to ""add"" padding by putting towels under the cover. Its an odd work around, but we didn't feel like taking it back. Our friends purchased a FisherPrice - Easy Fold and that seems to be more appropriately sized. Also, the cover says not to machine wash... obviously a stupid restriction for a baby high chair cover."
2,Not as good as Graco Contempo,"I'm disappointed in this chair because I think Baby Trend usually makes good products. While it is easy to use, it seems geared toward bigger kids. My 10-month old always falls to the side of the chair and the tray is too high on her chest (she's average height and has been sitting up for months).I have been able to get food stains out of the fabric by washing the entire cover on Delicate cycle and then air-drying. However, the cushion on the bottom has bunched up inside the fabric and I have not been able to flatten it out.My nephew has a Graco Contempo, which my daughter has used, and I like it much better because she sits up higher and the tray comes right to her at the appropriate height. When my daughter is done with this chair, I think I'll sell it in a garage sale and get a Graco for the next kid."
5,One word - PERFECT!,"I love the fabric, cushioned seat and so does my 7 month old daughter. I was a little worried about getting it soiled, so we put a fabric protector on it. I haven't even had to wash it yet. I've just wiped off any little drop that has gotten on it. I can't say enough about the ability to roll it around. I wheel her from room to room if I need to. The removable tray is a big plus too. Setup took about 5 minutes. The fabric is very neutral and isn't too babyish, but it does have the adorable and tasteful palm tree logo on it. The chair my son used was difficult to tilt without him in the chair. This one, I can tilt up and down with her in it. The price was exceptional too. What can I say, except PERFECT!!"
2,Think twice about this one!,"I got this as a shower gift, and also loved all its features. But after owning it for almost a year now and many many washes the padding fell apart, and the batting fell out. Baby Trend was not all that plesent to deal with, and after waiting almost 6 weeks for a replacement pad i was very upset to recieve it with the seams torn and the batting again coming out.All Baby Trend offered to do was to again replace the pad...but this should be recalled before someones child chokes on it loose materials."
3,Some good news and some bad,"The good news:- Chair is easy to assemble- Rolls nicely- Tray slides on and off easilyThe bad news:- The cover is impossible to keep clean, I have to wash it at least once a week- Batting inside the cover bunched up after two washes on delicate cycle with line-dry- The chair only came with one tray (additional trays would be a nice time saver)- Tray is too big for our standard sized dishwasher"
2,hate this chair!,I cannot stand this highchair! It was way to difficult to clean. The tray sits up to high for baby! I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!
3,Just okay...,"This chair does its job in that my son is safe and gets to eat. I would highly recommend a vinyl seat that can be easily wiped down between meals because once my son started on finger foods the fabric cushion was just ridiculous to keep clean. The cushion does stand up to washing pretty well, but once you remove the straps to wash them(and you do want to wash the straps once your child has mashed a meal or two into them) you need to be a rocket scientist to get them back in. Although the fisher price high chair is not as pretty to look at, I wish I had just sucked it up because the convenience of vinyl would far outweigh aestheticas at this point. Also, we barely use this seat since my son is just as happy in the Fisher Price Booster seat for $25. It is a breeze to clean and also keeps him strapped in very well."
2,Too big for baby; too bulky for kitchen,"I thought my research uncovered the perfect chair, but my gal is almost a year old, and this thing still makes her look like Lily Tomlin in the giant rocker. Yes, it's assembled and flexible, and yes, the navy blue plaid we chose wasn't too obnoxious, but my $16 booster is the bomb. (When we're not traveling, it lives in our daughter's kitchen chair.) Oh, and the removable top tray is a nice idea, but it was too big for our standard-size dishwasher. I'm selling this thing. On a bright note, line-drying the cushion isn't a big deal and shouldn't hinder you from purchasing this if your heart is set on a rolling plastic monstrosity clad with ruffle."
1,Tray To High,"We got this because we liked the pattern. The tray is way to high for our son. I don't think it was designed correctly. Also it is a pain to wash. Food, etc. gets into every part of the highchair that you didn't even know was there. We ended up taking it back and are now using a feeding chair that straps to our kitchen chair."
3,you must be kidding,"This book is more inflated than Mario Batali. Its an absolute sin that I foulishly just paid way too much for a book that doesn't make it for me at all. I read the reviews on amazon, which are always somewhat useful, and looked forward to my new read. Incredibly dissappointing. Don't get me wrong its a nice book with nice photographs, it just wasn't the find I was hoping for. If I hadn't of known better I'd thought I was reading Vongs cookbook. We've got plenty more talented chefs here. Anyway I hope someone finds this review helpful,and by no means did I mean to offend anyone. Good book but no Wild Food From Land And Sea or Jean Louis Cooking With The Seasons."
5,Couldn't put the book down!,"Excellent story of a Jewish family who fled Czechoslovakia during WW II. They ended up in Italy for nine years. It tells of their struggles in a new country, and how helpful the Italian people were. I have read numerous books about how Jews were treated in Germany and other European Country, but have next read about what life was like in Italy during this time. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about what life was like for different people is differnt times."
5,Great variety of mixes of the same song!,"If you love this song, then you'll love the different mixes they've done! It's an awesome CD for working out to...very high energy!"
4,Cascada has Beautiful Music! BUY IT!,"Wow, this is such a great CD! Cascada's music is wonderful! Such a pretty voice! It's worth buying....but only if you can take the same dance beat in every single song. The lyrics are fantastic but it can kind of drive you nuts aftering hearing the same dance beat in every song on the CD besides one of them. My favorite songs are 'Bad Boy', 'How Do You Do', 'Miracle' and 'Can't Stop the Rain from Falling'."
1,worst case scenario,This case would not fit on my Walt Johnson AND the cutout for the handle was in the wrong place! Don't waste your money
5,Lothagam,An excellent volume with plenty of information and excellent illustrations. A must have for any paleontology collector.
4,Watered down version of the Transactional COM+ Book,"This book is a somewhat condensed version of Transactional COM+ by Tim Ewald. However, this book is much better in summarizing (and reinforcing) the important issues when developing VB/COM+/IIS applications as compared to Transactional COM+ which does indulge in gratuitous details too often. Effective Visual Basic is definitely not for beginners, rather, it makes sense only if you've repeatedly wondered why COM+ works the way it does. Rule 3-4 also gives a good understanding of why stateless objects aren't always good. If you ever wondered why Singletons are not good in the COM+ world (or why you cannot stick COM object references into the ASP Session Object) then Rule 3-2 explains it all. This book is a must for anyone designs and implements scaleable COM+ applications. Many of the generic COM+ concepts apply whether you plan to use C++ or VB."
3,for the $$ it's fine,I needed something inexpensive and easy to put up to keep cats out of a room intil I could have a door made. It is a breeze to put up. It really doesn't keep the cats out but if a hook and eye were added at bottom I believe that would take care of the problem. I have had it up maybe a month and it is splitting at one of the folds. It is a fine temporary solution and if I could find one in wood I would install it permanently. I like it because I have a small house and because it folds I have no doors in the way.
3,Plastic,"This was easy to install, it does work well for our needs and the price is perfect but you have to know this plastic. From far away it gives a wood illusion but up close you see that it is flimsy. It does suit our needs but if you wanted something that would hold up to kids this would not be the product."
2,36 Inch is kind of stretching it,"No way would the magnet latch hold if fully extended. I used an old ski pole propped against the handle and dug into the rug to seal the door closed. My opening is 36"" and the door stretched to about 34 1/2 "". So I covered the box it came in with fabric and screwed it to the wall to fill the gap. I thought the price was reasonable until I started working with the door. A plastic shower curtain would do as good a job. It's made in Vietnam, but I don't blame them, just an observation. It is just too expensive for something that a plastic curtain could do for 1/3 the price. Also it doesn't look like it will last very long. So if your door is less than 36"" wide and you want some place to play with duct tape in the near future, then this is your item."
2,Not encouraging,"The accordion door came with the plastic around the magnet split and discolored. It seems that the vertical plastic part was intended to house a smaller magnet and that they ran out of the right sized ones and tried to make do by forcing a bigger magnet into too small a space. We hope they stopped doing that before they got any more reactions like ours. We are so disappointed with such a thing that we don't want to bother to install it or even return it. Money lost...we gave it 2 stars for the benefit of doubt. The similar door that we wanted to replace lasted over 20 years; this one looks okay but if the splitting plastic is a clue as to how the rest would hold up: it's not worth installing! If we had known, we would have written to find out if the problem had been corrected... which is what we suggest you do. Moreover, it is why we are writing this review (in order to give the manufacturer a chance to fix the defect for future customers)."
4,Functional but that's about all,"This door is extremely functional, but labelling it flimsy is an understatement. Installation is relatively easy but durability I'm not so sure about, time will tell."
2,"Cheap, but motivational",This door is pretty cheap in cost and function. It looks pretty bad (fake) when it is set up. The magnet latch it pretty week especially since my 6lb cat is still able to make her way through it. I got it as a test though so I can't complain too much. If you are just trying to create a strictly visual barrier between rooms then it works well.
5,Pratchett Takes on Politics,"Terry Pratchett made it clear about a dozen books ago that when he is writing - no one is safe. Jingo focuses on the government control, or lack thereof, of Leshp - an island that has mysteriously surfaced between Ankh-Morpork (which is, of course, nothing like Britain) and Klatch (which is, of course, nothing like Northern Africa or the Middle East).Making fun of politics both modern and medieval, Jingo showcases the City Watch from such books as Men At Arms and Feet of Clay. Commander Vimes, a constant adversary of the nobility, faces the daunting task of averting a war when the hilariously clueless noblemen of the city attempt to raise an army to fight the vastly superior forces of Klatch for control of Leshp.This is one of the standout books of the series, especially if you have a disdain for politics in general. Pratchett is dead-on on his satirical commentary and even manages to squeeze in a plot among all the irony. Top notch!"
4,Like Maxwell Coffee...Good to the Last Drop,"Excellent book. It's bursting at the seams with laughter, but the puns don't jump up and try to snare you, you find them yourself. If you like the discworld novels, you might try Piers Anthony's Xanth novels. The two are similar and yet totally different"
2,What the heck does Jingo mean?,"There were some fun bits in this one, but I couldn't really get into it. 'Jingo' seemed to appear on only one page, and only as a meaningless curse. The story didn't have a lot to it, and the laughs were sparse. I was also disappointed by the disoragnizer and it's journey down the wrong leg of the trousers of time. There could have been a great deal of fun and chaos as a result (remember the madness in Mort?) but Pratchett missed out. Worth reading, still, but not in hardcover. It is Pratchett's worst discworld novel, but that means it is better than almost every other fun-fantasy writer ever!"
3,Another Discworld Novel,"While the main hero of the novel is Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, the story jumps from character to character, and from sub-plot to sub-plot, leaving the story somewhat fragmented. Ankh-Morpork and Klatch become involved in a dispute over ownership of the desolate island of Leshp which has risen from the sea. It is a typical story of countries spending vast amounts of their resources in a dispute over a relatively worthless piece of real estate, with various people pursuing their own agendas and feathering their own nests as they appeal to patriotism. With sailing ships, camels, a stolen (somewhat threadbare) flying carpet, and a submarine, the plot gets interesting. The story is humorous, but various dead bodies are left about the landscape."
2,A bit lame...,"... but as a true Discworld-fan I guess you just have to have the whole collection. Don't waste your money on the hardcover edition, though. Better buy the paperback!"
3,Good Fun But . . .,"I recently read Terry Pratchett for the first time through an advanced reader's copy of ""The Fifth Element."" I greatly enyoyed that book and immediately went out and purchased""Jingo."" While to a large degree similar--though I felt the former to be better plotted and more tightly written--I found the similarities here beginning to wear thin midway through the book. It wasn't that I was bored, or found Pratchett's writing lacking in inventiveness, but that his use of plot devices were already becoming familiar. Not a good sign, if a reflection upon the other 23 Discworld titles. I think I'll give Pratchett a rest; perhaps after a few months the next title I read will appear fresher."
5,Passivists wanted!! Apply at the Dragon Hatchery!!!,"Terry Pratchet is brilliant...as always. Having read the Discworld series, I never fail to be impressed with how he keeps all his characters in character. A funny and brilliant portrayal of war-mongering for all the wrong reasons. (And are there really any right reasons?) Read it, you won't be sorry. And if you are, I can hardly be held responsible for the fact that you have NO sense of humor."
5,"You don't like war? You'll like, and learn from, this book.","Copper Samuel Vimes is a peace officer in Ankh-Morpork and his job is to keep the peace. Even when the criminals happen to be two armies.This book examines, in a remarkably funny way, the mechanisms that leads to war and how rulers manipulates its subjects so they're fit for fight.I envy those who havn't read this book yet. You've got a good time ahead of you. You might want to read the other City Watch books by Pratchett first. They're just as good and you'll learn ""Howe to Summone Dragons"" ."
5,A Thought-Provoking Yet Side-Splitting Adventure,"How to summarize it? I have always been a Terry Pratchett fan since I first started reading his stuff, and this one really continues the tradition. This is one of the best books about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch to date. It is also an insightful look at the reasons we as humans react to people different from us. I cracked up when Colon and Nobby were forced into joining the secret mission. I was thrilled when Vimes arrested his superiors. I also saw the clever commentary on the cold war. Veni, vidi, vici!"
3,Like reading a very mediocre play,"I really hoped to enjoy ""Jingo,"" and did like its lampoon of seemingly needless conflicts over religion and territory. Nevertheless, Pratchett is not much of a prose stylist. He focuses so much on dialogue that reading this is like reading a play. There is virtually no description of events, places, or people, and the characters talking is endless and becomes taxing. I was ultimately disappointed by this novel because of its style (or lack there of), which is unfortunate because it could have been a very good satirical novel."
4,A standard outing,"This is by no means the best of the Watch novels ... but even an average Pratchett novel is a thing of beauty. By turns deadly serious and laugh-out-loud funny, the book has only three weaknesses (which other reviewers have touched upon).First, most of the Watch characters get barely anything to do. Second, the Patrician is way out of character. And finally, the ending is pretty weak.Nevertheless, this is a still a great and very entertaining read. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point, though, as Guards! Guards! is a better introduction, Men at Arms is funnier, and Feet of Clay is a better mystery."
3,An OK book,"I have to confess that I find this one of Pratchett's weaker efforts, although it is still a good read. Although he always has some fairly deep and philosophical messages in his writing, they are usually so well hidden by the humour that you don't realise they are there. In ""Jingo"", I found there to be a bit less humour than normal and, as a result, the political undertones to the book rather stood out sometimes.Don't get me wrong -- Pratchett's message (at its most basic level, without spoiling any of the plot, that war is silly) is quite profound, but it is rather jarring when it appears, uncovered, in parts of a book that is ostensibly a comedy. I usually love the Guards series of books the most (""Guards, Guards"" is possibly one of his best books), but I feel that this is probably the weakest of them. It is most like ""Feet of Clay"" but does not have as much suspense.Still, a worthwhile read and a good book for a rainy day."
4,The Discworld at War - that only leads to disaster,"In a great way Terry describes the futility of war and racism - a truly remarkable achievement. Hopefully, all those fanatics out there with guns who are fighting one or other holy war for reasons of...well, maybe a recently emerged island in the pacific or something, will also read this book, and think again. Back to the book: it's the Nightwatch again, growing ever bigger in number and stature. And our friend Leonard da Quirm shows us what we have been missing in modern day inventors - truly stupid ideas to make your life easier but more complicated at the same time. A great laugh, and it keeps you longing for the next volume."
1,I didn't like it,"I bought this because of all of the rave reviews, but I didn't like it. I was very disappointed. I like this sort of music which I call ""trance music"" and I have many of them; most don't live up to the expectations I thought it had, and this is CD doesn't as well.I listened to it one time. I thought it plain ordinary droll new age dribble."
4,Sylvia's Lovers (Penguin Classics),"After discovering the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, I've been collecting as many of her books as possible. I look forward to reading this book."
5,Paybacks Are Forever,"Unfortunately, all too often we learn from our mistakes after it's too late. Seldom is one fortunate enough to use others' mistakes as a way of preventing unnecessary and often irreversible heartache. It's stories like this that make me see the value of religion and rules or commandments. And if suffering leads to growth, sometimes immaturity is not such a bad thing.Basically, this is a tragically sad story. The title is Sylvia's Lovers but in my opinion it should have been Philip's Folly. He made a self-serving decision that affected several people's lives and most of all destroyed him and the object of his obsessive love, Sylvia. We all know people whose trajectory of their life was interfered with by others' dishonesty or desire for control with catastrophic results. Betrayal is very difficult to forgive and often establishes lifelong pain."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I was given this knife as a present and am very surprised with it's overall quality. The balance seems to be a bit off, but it takes and holds an edge rather well. For those who prefer a heavier knife, this will suit your needs. I'm not sure what it is about this knife, but vegetables seem to cling to the blade. The only thing I can compare it to is trying to pull a suction cup off of a window. If you need a budget chef's knife for day-to-day tasks, Cuisinart has your back. If you want solid craftsmanship, save up $100 for a Wustof or Global."
1,Damaged. Not replaced,I own another Cuisinart knife that I love. Thought I'd buy the chef's knife as a compliment but when it arrived the blade was damaged; bent and the edge was very wavy. I was told by Amazon that they would send a replacement and that I should wait. I have. Nothing has shown up and this knife is unusable unless I want to chop something.Not happy.Vincent
3,"Good, but dangerous","Like all Microplane graters, this one is great. In my experience, it produces about the same results as the coarse model, so I'm not sure about the ""medium"" label, but it works quite well.You have to be extra-careful when using this one, though. Because the blades are so sharp, it grates so fast, and you are applying pressure in both directions, it is easy to hurt yourself. I inadvertently trimmed a fingernail the first time I used it. I was impressed that the sharp blades went through my fingernail like butter, but it wasn't really a good thing. Had the angle been a little different, it would have been the tip of my finger and a some blood mixed in with my grated cheese.Since the results are so similar, I would recommend using the safer ""coarse"" model instead."
5,The best ( ) you can spend,"This book contains hundreds of ideas to make sure that you buyor build a good house. From design to advice about material selectionto building tips, it has it all. The only shortfall is that it does not have specific brand recommendations. I guess this ensures an unbiased opinion.For every dollar you pay for the book, you will get sigificant savings, more enjoyment of your house and less aggravations and distress with future problems. One advice: If you buy this book, read it and take notes. Nothing will make you mad at yourself when you find a problem with a new house more than having good information and not reading it. END"
5,"unique, valuable resource","About half a million people a year buy a new home from a builder, and many of them would be a lot more satisfied with the results if they were to use this book. It provides you with the ""inside knowledge"" of a building engineer. It tells readers how to apply that knowledge when working with a builder. I have been sent many books to review for our homefair.com web site. Most of them just state the obvious. This is the one that offers the most valuable information to the consumer."
5,Probably the single best investment a home buyer can make.,"This book is an essential investment for new or experienced home buyers. Architects, home desigers and contractors can also learn from it. Having inspected thousands of buildings in 12 states, over 33 years as an Architect, I feel well qualifed to comment on this book. Myron has done an excellent presentaion of every element in home construction and what a buyer should be looking for to get the most benefits from their home purchase. If I were designing houses I would give every potential client a copy of this book so they could take advantage of the books wealth of home design information before we planned their house. It would make design communication more effective. A more informed home owner makes choices which fits their needs best. J.E. Jones, NCARB Accredited Architect"
2,Fine if you're building a tract home out West!,"The author clearly comes from the West Coast -- a lot of the examples (such as roof type) apply out there and no where else. Many of the examples dealt with tract homes -- not custom homes from more upscale builders.The book also needs to be updated a bit more and take more of a PROACTIVE rather than reactive approach. There are alot of choices out there today, it would be great to have guidance on all the choices step by step."
5,Old cartoon still has new thrills.,"Lensman! Endowed with the power of the almighty lens, Kimble Kennison, has to defeat the Boskone empire and save human kind. The Boskone have developed a new DNA weapon which has no defense. At least that is what the Boskone think. Stored in the Lens on Kim's left hand is the formula that will neutralize the weapon. Now the only thing left to do is return it to Admiral Haines. That is where the fun begins. The Boskone destroy an entire planet hoping to obliterate the lensman and the lens. When that fails they pursue him across the galaxy in the Brittania. After meeting Warzal , Buzzkirk, Kris, and Kim attempt to free Radalex and then destroy the overlord of Delgon. Talk about your nonstop action. Lensman delivers on all counts. Definately a must see for all fantasy lovers."
3,My Second Review (Wiser),"Alright, its been quite a while since I reviewed this movie the first time. I admit I was a bit immature, but it was only because I was so biased to like this movie. I grew up watching this, so this is my ""power ranger"". Never the less, I have to admit the voice acting is very dated. The animation is likewise. However, it is a very unique anime, with old computer graphic styles mixed into it. Think of it as a mix of Star Wars and Titan AE. Its still a good movie. However, I have a question. For FANS of this anime, they will know that there was a series that used to be on tv. However, it is near impossible to find this. I would be most grateful is someone could write me at ndg1231@verizon.net to tell me where I could find or purchase the tv series. Thank you."
2,Goodwill can only do so much.,"'Before Stonewall' was not just a celebratory film documenting the underground gay resistance to [...] America before the historic moment of Stonewall in 1969. As the frightening utterances of then-President Reagan reveal, this was very much an urgent political gesture, a protest against 80s conservative retrenchment.This is an illuminating and endearing documentary, full of wonderful anecdotes (e.g. Eisenhower's failure to sack the lesbian element of the WAC because it was all lesbian!), a moving reunion of elderly patrons of a notorious gay bar, and an inspiringly un-bitter outlook. The talking-heads-with-stills formalt becomes monotonous, and self-congratulation sometimes creeps in."
2,"Excellent Book , if you are already organized!","I agree with an earlier review of this book. Nothing new here! Although the layout of this ""Dummies"" book, follows in the basic outline of all in this series, that is about the extent of the helpful content. It is obvious that the author is organized - as she practically refers back to her own talent in that area frequently. She must not have anyone in her life close to her that is of a different thought process. Namely - the unorganized. I don't believe that she undersands our mindset one bit.If you want real help, keep looking!"
2,Produce defective - vendor has excellent customer service.,"Unfortunately, the bw & color printer cartridges - refurbished and priced right - only lasted one day, even though they did print the first day just fine. Vendor offered full refund and sent postage-free return envelope - prompt and excellent customer service! Maybe this was a fluke, but I was disappointed."
5,Making Bright Print Copies!,MIPO proves to be an excellent supplier for HP 96 and 97 Black and Tri-color Ink! We received the order in a timely manner. Will order again and soon! Excellent....Very Pleased! Hope this successful order repeats itself in the future.
1,Crap,"Very flimsy, and it arrived broken. I do not recommend this product at all. Packaging was extremely poor, it came unprotected in a plain envelope."
2,obsolete?,"I got this book to learn Mac OS X programming and was very disappointed. There's way too much info on Mac OS 8 and 9, which is great for people who are migrating old applications; but if you're writing new applications like I am, it just gets in the way. Many screenshots are old and do not look like OS X windows. It talks about CDEF resources, which do not work in OS X; it does not talk about the updated way custom controls are done. Code samples use WaitNextEvent(), which is deprecated. There's nothing on quartz, but lots of info on quickdraw, which is deprecated. Nothing on HIView, OpenGL, etc. It appears that this was a great book in its day, but now, it'll probably just confuse you."
4,"Ottawa Citizen review of ""Wieners""","Wieners Rating 3 out of 4 starsWhile the idea of three men taking a road trip in a Wienermobile may not sound all that appealing, there's more than rubber meeting the road and mustard meeting the meat in this surprisingly funny effort featuring Fran Kranz, Kenan Thompson and Zachary Levi.After being humiliated by a Dr. Phil-styled TV shrink, Joel (Kranz) decides he's going to get even. With his buddies by his side, they venture off with a quest for justice, but find it's not easy to make people listen when there's a giant wiener in the picture. Definitely stupid, but thanks to some sweet buddy moments, this movie steers away from the typically silly genre moments and finds some original flavour.DVD features are sadly lacking on this disc, but there is a Thai dub -- in addition to Spanish, French and Portuguese ones."
2,"WIENERS IS STUPID FUN, BUT RUNS OUT OF GAS IN THE LAST ACT! 2 1/2 STARS!","I like stupid movies and I like the stars of this film. 'Wieners is just stupid enough to keep those who enjoy these mindless crude humor films interested, but it is ultimately forgettable. If you like fast food fun films try Kenan Thompson's 'Good Burger' instead. It's funnier that this film and I'll take a burger over a ""wiener"" any day of the week! ;-b"
4,male strippers,The best thing about this silly-but-fun movie is ZACHARY LEVI--this actor is so likeable and full of GoodCheer; he brightens whatever film he's in. This one was made before he did the memorable TV series CHUCK.
4,Fascinating read,Those who hold on to the belief of a God-inspired bibilical text won't have their minds changed -- but those who seek rational answers to all the brouhaha over the old fairy tales of the Bible will find real food for clear thought and understanding.
4,intense,"This was my first Gershwin purchase. The magnificent female voices captured his feelings. I was moved the first time I listened and am still moved the 3,000th time I listen to it. It sets a romantic, still mood. You'll know what I mean when you listen."
4,The Ladies Sing with Class,"These are classic renditions of classic Gershwin from Verve Records. The only disappointment is The Dinah Washington rendition of Summertime is an instrumental, no Dinah singing, unless she's humming in the background. The trumpet solo is marvelous. She does sing ""I've got a crush on you."" No liner notes are provided. All you get is the singer, the title and the original album."
4,The classics...,"Gotta love the classics...this is a great CD. I love to hear the old recordings of Shirley Horn, Dinah Washington and Ella Fitzgerald. They songs they sing are great too. I listen to them at work and people are always amazed that this type of music is still around. I'm always happy to remind them that these are the classics that won't ever go away."
5,Love it,"Ordered it and they said it was on back order, So when it come on Christmas eve. I cant tell you how happy I was since I bought it to go with the Mane and braids book, Our horse lover was very happy to find this under the tree."
4,Oster Brush,"This mane and tail brush is excellent. Easy to hold on to, and combs through manes and tails of horses almost effortlessly."
4,Very Good Brush!,"This brush is wonderful for using on horses with long, thick manes and tails. I use it in combination with a grooma swivel-teeth comb and have great results!One thing I've noticed is that, within 2 months of regular use, the end-caps on some of the brush bristles have begun to come off. This leaves a bristle with a rather sharp point on the end.This brush has been my favorite to use and, despite some of the end-caps coming off, I would recommend it to others!"
5,Best horse brush there is!,"This is honestly the BEST mane and tail brush there is! It works far better than combs, because it has more surface area. The handle is great. It's like a big round comb. It's great for shows, or just lessons when I'm in a hurry and want to untangle manes and tails quickly without pulling out a bunch of hair. I once accidently left mine out at my trainer's farm, and the next week when I came back to get it it was full of horse hair! There is no doubt that horses and people will think this is the greatest mane and tale brush there is.Buy this product, your horse will thank you! =)"
5,Easy to hold,"This mane and tail brush works great. Especially, on my mare's tail. It's handle is easy to hold and it gets the tangles out faster and easier the the old style combs."
3,Oscar Shumsky was a violinist... even when he played viola. But a great violinist!,Shumsky was a violinist... even when he played viola. He was really a great violinist! However violin and viola are distinct instruments which diference is not a question of size or just because there isn't a C string in the violin and an E in the viola. The matter is tone. And this means that one must know how to play a different role in performance.
3,Florida Architecture of Addison Mizner,"A thoughtful, and general overview of the work of this eclectic and influential resort architect. While the text is well written, the total lack of any siteplans, floorplans, and elevations cause this book to provide only a partial understanding of Mizner's work. All photos are black and white, and while this serves to keep the book modestly priced, it also severely limits the reader's enjoyment. Still, for the cost a worthwhile bargain."
3,"Ashish Mishra, Mishra Architecture PLLC","This is a good, historic representation of the life and work of Addison Mizner. The Author has made an excellent attempt to capture the style of the Designer. The book lacks any color photographs, drawings or elevations that is expected in a book dealing with Architecture. I imagine that there is a dearth of information on the Mizner available and some of his buildings no longer exist. It is a good book if you are really interested to learn about the beginnings of contemporary Florida architecture."
3,"Not without a couple good ones, but mostly a cash-in on ""Word Up""","A towering presence in the world of funk, this long-lasting group has had many memorable hits. Their last album before this, 1986's ""Word Up"" was one of their best efforts, spawning smash hits with the title track and ""Candy."" The problem with this album isn't so much that it's all that bad, because it really isn't, but more the fact that it seems to be a deliberate carbon copy of its predecessor in some ways. The track ""Pretty Girls"" sounds almost exactly like the title track from ""Word Up,"" and ""Honey"" is practically nothing more than ""Candy"" with the word ""honey"" in place of the word ""candy."" The slow groove ""In The Night,"" featuring the legendary Miles Davis playing trumpet, is very good. However, if you want to experience Cameo's later works, go for their 1990 album ""Real Men Wear Black"" instead. It has more originality and generally makes better use of the new-jack swing formula than this."
3,Really big stuff.,"this ring, to me, looked a little more dainty than it turned out to be. It's almost too chunky. The lettering isn't engraved into the silver as it looks either, it's more like the ring is hollow and the letters are holes.ehhh... it's ok. Don't love it, don't hate it."
2,Broke during assembly,"While reading the directions I also, as a few reviewer stated, put them aside and looked at photo on box to assemble. When I got to the part where part A goes in the loop, the stitching came apart with very little force to get the loop over the end of part A. Other loop was OK. I returned the product and asked for a refund. It appeared to me that it would not hold up in the back of the Subaru wagon with dogs , even if closed up. Will look for something that will hold up."
4,Fits the need,"Kind of a pain to put together, but it does work pretty good at keeping stuff from rolling around the back of the SUV. Not bad for the price. I would recommend it to others, in fact I already have."
3,Its alright,"So a lot of people said the directions are confusing. They were not to me...if you look at the picture. It took me about 25 min to put together. The size is decent and goes well in my car to keep things organize. The only downside of this the material look cheap. It kinda reminded me of an onion basket. I would not put anything that will slip threw holes (like tools) because the material looks like it can easily rip. Also its not very lengthy. I was expecting a bit more space inside the pockets. Each pocket is about the size and with of an Official NBA ball. I know cause that's what I put in there. For the price its ok, I think I could have lived with out it. Yet since I have it now, I keep my basic stuff in there that wont role around. ie baskeball jumper cables and other things that move around in the trunk."
4,Not too thick on the sides but very good,"Its a little flimsy but its supported by the trunk of your car so thats really not a problem however you really dont want to drop anythin on top of it i feel like the plastic sides would break, but its definitly worth the 30 i paid not only can i put things in it but behind it due to the low metal bar in the back and its adjustable so it can relly get a tight fit. The assembly instructions are useless i didnt even look at them but its very simple so they arent neccesary and a really nice feature is it will fold up into itself if you need the space for somthing bigger, overall im pleased with the purchase and recomend it"
4,Fine for the price.,"The Hopkins Storagemaster is exactly the product I needed, and is working-out very well indeed. A little bit tough toassemble, as one particular instruction isn't very clearly explained, but once I figured it out, all was fine. I don't knowhow long it will last, as it doesn't seem particularly robust, but unless you plan to use it for heavy objects, I'm sure itwill be fine for most purposes.(Groceries, spare shoes, umbrellas, etc.)"
4,Keeps my stuff in place,"I put this into my hatch back car-it is great! Now I don't have stuff sliding all around the back of my car. It stays put, doesn't slide around. It was a little interesting to put together, just follow the directions and it isn't too bad. It does adjust if your car is a little less wide than average. The assembly is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars-but I'm not too good at that kind of thing!"
1,Save your money,"This item is a cheap piece of junk.Also, I get the impression that a team of people that do not speak English were assigned the task of putting together the instruction manual. It is impossible to comprehend.I threw this thing in the trash."
2,"Easy to put together, easy to come apart","I used this cargo organizer in the back of a Yukon that I have sold. I attempted to use it for about 6 monts before removing it. The gear I stored (boots, tool belt, mountain bike cleats, rope, chains) in the bins may have been the cause of the unit disassembling in the back of my vehicle, but I would probably not purchases this product again if given the option. If you ownly intend to use this for shopping or groceries, then you may find some use, otherwise steer clear.I eventually opted for the Rola 59001 M.O.V.E. Rigid-Base Interior Organizer (38"" x 15"") which was a much better product!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E81VN8/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i00"
1,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this item but it turned out to be very disappointing. Not sturdy at all and kept coming apart at the ends. As others have said, the assembly directions were not helpful at all. You kind of had to figure it out on your own. I think adding another bar would help to stabilize it and would greatly improve the durability. Although the netting is not great, I think it would still work with the improved stability. I had to return the item for a refund which Amazon processed without any problem."
5,Good blend of composition and technique,"Dan Lambert seems to me to be one of those unknown, major players on the acoustic guitar scene - if that contradiction makes any sense. He can rip, startle you, play nice and pretty, and his compositions are as unique as they get...check out the first tune on here, at times it doesn't even sound like a guitar."
2,"Okay, but...","I am a guitar student of Dan's, and have been for 4 or 5 years. He has incredible talent and potential, but he simply does not make music that most people can enjoy. He plays a very strange combination of folk and jazz, with unexpected and often annoying twists and turns in between. He gets his influence from a bunch of unknown Latin and South American players, and they lead him to paths that nobody can understand. Dan is an unhappy artist: he is passionate about everything he records, but nobody else is. Unfortunately for him, he will never be anything more than a solo guitarist that performs in smoky bar rooms and quiet restaurants."
3,SOSO,"Thought DVD would have been better as I like Eddie Griffin, but talking about church beliefs the way he did turned me off. Plus way, way too many 'F' bombs...took away from the context. Had I watched it somewhere before, I would not have bought it."
2,outdated stlye with updated names and events,"Don't get me wrong the dvd did have some laughs. Before you buy be advised this standup is mostly white jokes and ni**a every 18 seconds.I understand that this is his style but it has me asking myself if this dvd was really made in 2010,i feel like im watching stand up from 2001.He does make some valid points,some good jokes and even takes a stab at religion but the rest of it feels recycled."
4,Better than Expected!,"I had seen this dvd when I was visiting some family out of town. I would've never even thought of looking at Eddie Griffin Standup before because I didn't think that he would be funny ... I was wrong, FUNNY DVD!"
5,Eddie Griffin and Comady Central Great Show and DVD,"I was at this show!And it was such a JOY asking Eddie to tell my mom HAPPY BIRTHDAY!Get the DVD and you can hear me asking him, and he was sooo quick witted to do a SAMMY DAVIS act while singing Happy Birthday to my mom! Thank You Eddie Griffin and Comedy Central for making this show a DVD! I now have a memory of my mother for ever!"
5,Off the chain!!!!,Eddie Griffin has been a long time favorite for me...He has his usual routine but he is so versatyle with his style and you've never knew of or seen any of his stand ups...you would'nt know but I like how he kicks just a little knowledge to make you think...A true master of turning thoughts into comedy...Educate your minds yunginz...THINK it aint illegal yet....
5,Hilarious and Candid,If you get offended easily go find a Robin Williams or other mild comedian. EG speaks his mind and entertains at the same time. Wonderful comedian.
4,Very funny material,"Very funny comedy material with only a few slow parts near end of the show. For those who bad mouth his preformance because of the Christian part, I am Catholic and I found that part of the show very humorous. People as a whole have to have a sense of humor or they will never get threw life as a whole. I just let myself go and enjoy life when I can enjoy it when not working, so if your looking to unwind with another good comedian pick this comedian up and listen and watch this preformance with an open mind and might be amazed just like I was with this preformance. So don't listen to the bad reviews just make up your own mind about the preformance."
5,drum 'n bass guru,"bukem has surprised me once again... i already have progression sessions 3 and 4, logical progressions (a and b), earth volumns 1 and 2... and now journeys has been added... i highly recommend this cd to any techno, rock, or even jazz fams... i only wish mc conrad was in this cd..."
5,The most prolific yet accessible album of the decade.,"Bottom line: if you don't acknowledge this album as spectacular, you have no appreciation for music. Go back to your N'Sync albums. Ltj Bukem has been amazing audiences for a decade with his funk and jazz tinged drum and bass. I was an assistant manager of an upscale restaurant and played this regularly. At least 3-4 times a night customers would ask what the music was.The album has several highlights but the one that sticks out the most is Watercolours. This is the second track on disc 1. It is a driving breakbeat with a sneaky bass line highlighted with suble saxophone riffs. The rest of the album is great, notably Sunrain, track 1 disc 2. Sultry female vocals. Also check out his Earth series."
1,he's had his 15 minutes of fame,"don't waste your money on this. it's boring, repetitive ambience that goes nowhere. and the best tracks on it all sound familiar, i.e. they're rip-offs of other people's tunes. you'd be better off spending your money on some of the 70s fusion records that bukem cheekily, inexplicably displays on the cd sleeve (leroy hutson, lonnie liston smith etc.)"
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I am a pretty big fan of LTJ Bukem, the Good Looking Records crew, and especially the Logical Progression series, and I was thrilled at the prospect of a new solo Bukem LP. Unfortunately, this album is one of the biggest let-downs I have purchased in years. It seems that on Journey Inwards LTJ has turned to Yanni and John Tesh for inspiration, as I could hardly differentiate this music from the lite-jazz sludge that my father listens to.Bukem does a fantastic job of mixing other artists' tracks... perhaps he should stick to that instead of turning drum 'n bass into music for our parents."
1,new level my ass,"this cd sucks. i bought it thinking that it was going to be the greatest dnb album ever, but found out quitte the opposite. all the people that say this album is taking jazz and dnb to a new level obviously know nothing aabout either. don't buy this crap."
3,Might not be what you expect from LTJ Bukem,"This album is quality through and through. LTJ, however, seems to have taken a bit of a turn, making this album more of a tribute to jazzed out hip hop and even a taste of R&B styles, than to his traditional flavour. If your enticed by the likes of Paris's DJ Cam or Tokyo's DJ Meiso, then you'll love love love this album. Personally, I'm waiting for his reversion back to the haunting sounds of Logical Progression that unroll emotional landscapes in your mind - so so smooth."
4,Stellar force on the Ambient Drum and Bass Scene,"I bought this 2-disc set on a whim, and I am glad I did. The set is a dreamy escape into the world of ambient Drum and Base. I like how Bukem has blended the nifty hooks of jazz-fusion with a softer version of Drum and Bass beats.This is music definitely for relaxing and enjoying its nuances. I really didn't listen to both discs all the way through until I went on a long flight. This CD set should be listened to all the way through at least once. Each song stands on its on, but together, this is a tour de force in the modern electronica genre."
5,Jazzy Downtempo & Melodic Ambient Drum & Bass,"I must point out that this CD is NOT hard core drum and bass. In fact, anyone expecting pure D & B will probably be disappointed with this CD. A significant portion of it is not D & B at all. But all of music is exceptional. LTJ manages to create music that is mellow without sounding bland or boring. Much of the music seems to either sample or be heavily influenced by 1970's jazz fusion."
5,"The Tender Years (A Prairie Legacy, Book 1)","I enjoyed this book as much if not more than her previous series with the Davis clan. This book has language that is easier to read. It involves a young girl and her desire to fit in with her friends, the things she does to belong, and what happens to the friendship when she says no. It also involves young love,and the challenge of friendship when a boy becomes part of the picture. Great for any age."
3,Got bored,"I got bored with this book. There was nothing that really made it different from other books in it's genre. Very predictable. An easy read, but nothing new."
5,Beautifully Written!!,"""The Tender Years"" is a wonderful book. I read it this past fall, and absolutely loved it! I had already read the Love Comes Softly series and was wondering what had happened to everybody! When I heard Janette Oke was coming out with the Prairie Legacy books, I couldn't believe it! I was very surprised at how young Virginia was (13), but also very happy. I'm a teenager too, so I could relate to alot of things in the book. I loved the way she learned to trust God (as we all need to.) All I can really say is... READ IT!! Thank you, Janette Oke! Happy Reading!!"
4,Cool Toy,"This is a great toy for a girl or boy. I bought this for my 10 month old Nephew but my 18 month old daughter loved playing with it before we gave it to him. It has a lot of different features, everything on the toy moves or makes some kind of noise. The noise could possibly get annoying."
2,Steering Wheels,"This toy is not as great as i thought, my son loves playing with steering wheels, I bought this one cause the one that he had was broken, but he rather play with the broken one than with this toy."
2,Decent Framework - Needing Substance,"This book is definitely a good read for the general reference or framework to use as a resource. This was a required book for a course I was taking in IT Budget and Financial Management and it was more of a reading assignment than a good book to reference. The chapters are short which keeps the attention span in tact, however, there isn't much substance that provided the guidance or real world examples that is normally expected.I would recommend this book to keep as a reference to reach back to, but if you are looking for depth and breadth this is one to pass on."
4,Great book for the enthusiast,"A highly interesting book on the topic of huge aeroplane engines. Just the right amount of techical language, but very readable as well. He is just a bit cheap on info of the most famous piston engine of all, the Merlin and Rolls-Royce as a company in this field. All in all, however, an entertaining book."
3,History of the technique of aero engines,"A nice book, wich give technical courses without beeing too heavy.It helps to understand the genesis of every family of engines, radial or in line. All the points of physics are introduced : thermodynamics, mechanics.Lots of drawing are helping to understand how an engines works.Hours of reading pleasure, in action."
4,As titled: Good Intro,"All in all, a very good introduction to aircraft piston engines. Provides a basic technical description of basic design and operation of piston engines, then moves into the history and development. While there is little detail on most engines discussed, it does cover most of the different designs manufactured over the years. It has some mention and coverage of non US/Brit/German engines (i.e. Russian), which is not something you see too much of else where. Throughout the book, there should be enough technical details to make any but a hard core engineer happy, but it is very readable for those who would define themselves as ""interested novice"". It does get slightly wordy and dry at some points, but not much. My only real critisism would be that it's shorter than I'd like, and really should go into more detail on some of the engineering aspects of some of the designs."
5,Buy this book before your next dentist appointment,"This book is an excellent reference tool. Before you let a dentist talk you into expensive, maybe unnecessary dental work that may create even more problems down the road, sit down with this book. You'll find clear explanations of dental problems and procedures and this book can give you additional information and assurance when you suspect your dentist's recommendations may not always be in your best interests."
5,Very upbeat progressive house with a scary twist!,"If you are a fan of progressive house music with intense buildups and scary,slammin' peaks, then this is the CD for you. I am one of those people who is always searching for ""That song"", and will gladly pay fifteen dollars for a cd with just one such song. I Was amazed, as you will be also, that this CD contains nine incredible tracks. Each track on this album could easily by released alone as a single and would sell well. The beats are intense, and each of the songs is very different sonding from the last. This would be a great purchase for the trance lover who would like to add a progressive house cd to his collection. So if you love music that makes you want to party 'til 11 in the morning... then this is the perfect CD for you."
1,Do Not Purchase Many Flaws,"Do not Purchase this kettle. The kettle started leaking in the first three months. My observations show that this kettle leaks at the seal between the water level indicator and the kettle body (a penetration into the body). Do your research and you will see that there is really a inability among manufacturers to design a kettle that does work without leaking. Purchase you next kettle without the water level or any other penetration into the main body of the kettle. I have a stainless steel stove kettle that is 22 years old and still works without leaking. Unfortunately it takes some time to reach a boil(a major advantage of electric kettles). I am sure that an electric kettle could be made that does not leak.To Kettle Designers and Manufacturers: Read this review and create your kettle around real world conditions, be quality driven not price driven. Why have I owned several kettles, all of which have failed. Take pride in your products....."
1,Dangerous,"I used this at work (in the winter only maybe once or twice a day) for about 3-4 years and when it worked, it was good. But many times the contacts in the base that connect to the kettle to heat the water had to be pried up with a paper clip (while unplugged of course) as they were down too far for the kettle to make contact. Now today it stopped working again so I adjusted the contacts again and it wouldn't work... I finally decided to open the base (also, while unplugged)to see what was going on and found that one of the wires was completely broken and another one was corroded, there was a bit of melted plastic around the wires as well.This is dangerous and should not be used. There was absolutely no evidence that there was a problem with corrosion or split wires in the base until I took it apart, which most people won't do, so they will either think it just stopped working or it may start a fire or something."
1,Great for a while -- then leaks like a sieve,"This kettle seemed like a good deal and worked well at first. Heck, it still heats water like a champ. The problem is that it leaks like crazy and does it into the electric element underneath. I figure that can't be good! It is definitely messy. It seemed so solid too. Oh well."
2,"Good kettle, pity it didn't last longer.","This kettle was fine for the first 18 months. It boiled water quickly, was convenient to fill and worked as advertised. The only flaw I found was the fact that it had no thermal insulation for the body of the jug, which got extremely hot.After 18 months, it stopped working. When I replaced it onto the cordless base, it wouldn't turn on. I unscrewed the base to find melted plastic and some significant burn residue where the power cord connects to the base. I'm glad this thing didn't burn my house down."
1,DON'T BUY THIS KETTLE: no replacement parts if you fry the bottom part,"Bottom part got fried by my oven vent. I called the company and they have no replacement parts whatsoever for the kettle. So I have the expensive top part and they will not send me, even for some money, the bottom part. It's nothing but a $40 piece of landfill now! I CONSIDER NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE REALLY REALLY BAD SERVICE AND A DISSERVICE TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. HAMILTON BEACH WILL NOT BE GETTING ANYMORE OF MY MONEY. And I hope they don't get any of yours either!"
5,Stainless steel electric cordless kettle,I absolutely love. It is light. Very fast to boil water. Exactly what I wanted.
2,Lasted 2 years,"Great kettle while it lasted, but then the base went puff, and the smoke signaled its demise after 2 years.This is a large chunk of steel to put in landfill. It's a shame these things are designed to fail so quickly. These a'holes should be forced to take back all the carcasses."
2,didn't last long,"Liked the look of this kettle compared to other stainless steel types, but it only lasted about 3 months!"
5,Love IT!,"We absolutely love this cordless, between the two of us we must turn it on 6-8 times a day - we like different teas and it's great for adding hot water to a recipe or making hot chocolate or french press coffee- have had it for over 3 years without any problems - when it does bite the dust I hope we can find one as reliable."
2,Leaks after two years,Has a serious leak after two years. It it attractive but should last longer. I also have a Hamilton Beach toaster that looks good but is poorly designed. Am going to avoid HB products in the future. Its a hassle and expensive to be replacing small appliances every two years.
1,"Keep Looking, this one won't last.","I am surprised to see this model is still being sold. I bought this in Canada ealier this year, and it worked only a few months before the base switch stopped working. Because I was now in the states, its was a minor hassle to get a warranty replacement through Hamilton Beach, but one was obtained and cost me $8 in misc shipping costs. That one worked only a few months longer, then died the same way as its predecessor. Fool me twice, shame on me, huh? There seems to be a fundamental engineering flaw with the base switch on the model. Hamilton Beach should take it off the market and re-think the switch. I really wanted this kettle to work for me, loved everything else about it."
1,Was good while it lasted,"Bought the kettle at target. Lasted 4 months after which the kettle no longer turns off automatically. Judging by other reviews, this appear to be a generic engineering problem. If I have to be next to kettle to turn it off manually, I might as well use a regular kettle."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't be tempted by the price--this is just junk in a fancy package. It broke on me after less than a year. Judging by the other comments on this site, I was lucky. Before this, I had a Braun which heated up quickly and worked for ten years without a hitch. This kettle took long to boil, the surface became dangerously hot, and both the on/off switch and the water level indicator stuck. Avoid."
3,Roomy But Noisy,"I bought this Hamilton Beach electric kettle to replace one that died. It's big and holds lots of water for multiple servings--good. It's noisy and because of the narrow bottom, kinda slow to heat--bad. So far it's been reliable but it's just more of the same cheap made-in-China stuff we can't seem to get away from anymore--very thin metal, cheap stainless veneer, low quality plastic base. I predict this kettle will last a couple years, like the last one. At least it looks pretty sitting on the countertop."
1,Leaking tea kettle,"We are on our third tea kettle by Hamilton Beach. Have liked the fact it is cordless. Nice stainless steel. Like the fact lid is removable. Poor quality though. Each one has leaked like a sieve. One was within the first month. They have always replaced them, free of charge. Sometimes it doesn't leak, most of the time it does. One even had the switch issue others talk about. When we call we have asked each customer rep if this has been an on going issue? You got it.....the answer is always no. Will not own another one and will not recommend that anybody buy it."
1,Broken within a year,I had the same experience as the other reviewers. The kettle looks great but started to leak when filled over the half way mark. After a few weeks of mopping up the element burned out. Nice design but poor quality.
1,Kettle will not switch off,This kettle worked well every morning for around three months to heat up water for coffee. The other morning I noticed the plastic handle was scalding hot to the touch and that most water had boiled off. The auto shut off has failed. I can only hope that if it were not caught it is smart enough to turn off before it melts or catches fire when all the water is gone.
4,Stylish kettle,"Very nice kettle, the on/off switch is now not switching off after 4 years of daily use.I used it maybe 3 times a day, so not like I didn't get moneys worth.I will be buying another one as I liked it.I think 4 years life is pretty good."
2,weird flavor,"Unlike many reviewers here, I've been using this kettle almost daily for a year with no leaks and no malfunctions. However, I've noticed that the water I boil in this kettle has a strange flavor. It tastes slightly sweet and it's strong enough to add noticeable flavor to the tea I drink. I'm certain that the water I use is not responsible for the flavor. I've put up with it for a while, but I'm getting concerned that whatever is causing this off-flavor may be toxic (not to mention that it affects the taste of whatever I use it for), so I'll be replacing the kettle shortly."
1,Stay Away from this HamiltonBeach 40886 Stainless Kettle!,"Save your time and save your money. We received this a Christmas present and the base will melt and burn. Not only is it dangerous and a fire hazard, but it is just another cheap appliance that must be replaced every 1-2 years. Heat your water a different way."
1,Sad User,"The Plastic Lever for turning on is flimsey and weak, therefore easily damaged as was ours. We reported to customer service and no response? Once a sucker buys the product forget about service. Buyer beware!"
1,Lid design is a problem.,"I liked this kettle but after a few months, the plastic knob on the lid came off. The treads were not reinforced with metal. Since the lid fits on the kettle very tightly, pulling up on it to fill the kettle required strong pull. The threads stripped and the knob came off."
1,This tea kettle leaks,"Within a month, this tea kettle was leaking. I had it replaced and the second one leaked too. I have now moved to a DeLonghi, and I'm surprised to find it also leaks. My first DeLonghi lasted five years and was still going strong but looked a little corroded, so I got a new one. I'm sorry I threw the old one out, because it looks like the new ones with the water level guages have seal problems and leak. If anyone knows of one that doesn't have this problem, I would sure like to know. This appliance is a necessity in our house. A whistling stove top tea kettle doesn't work for hearing-impaired people and we depend on the auto shut off feature for safety."
1,Don't do it,I purchsed this kettle about half a year ago and it's already broken. The switch kept turning off automatically before boiling. On top of that the outside is not insulated and i got burned by it.
4,Boiling great for a year and half!,"We have had ours for a year and a half, and we love ours, using it at least once a day for tea or the french press. I am surprised to read so many bad reviews! That is a shame... We bought ours for under $28, and I guess if it lasts another year we won't be too dissipointed. I love the design, and being full stainless steel is important to us. I like that I can wrap the cord around the bottom to shorten the length. My biggest pet-peeve is the little black plastic marks it leaves on my counter, but they clean up easy...The next one we would buy would have to be insulated, but I will look for one with a similar design."
5,Love to draw with Colorase pencils!,"I purchased these pencils upon the recommendation of Matt Archambault, a School of Visual Arts teacher who runs videos of his students sketchbooks on youtube. One student recommended the pencils to him, he tried them, liked them, after all you can erase your lines and start over! And it adds a bit of colour to your sketch book. I like them too!"
5,perfect fit!!!,"I saw the warnings about the sizing and went by the size chart (since leather doesn't stretch....) and when i put them on after getting them, they were a perfect fit! could not be happier!!!!"
4,Very good value for the price,"I ordered the Extra Large for myself and the XXL for my husband. My husband's fit perfectly. Mine were a bit large, but they are still workable. We measured as per the instructions given too. The quality of the chaps is very good, especially for the price. I am a little disappointed that the grommets on the belt are already falling off, but perhaps that is because I had to cinch them down so tight. They kept us comfortable on our late spring ride through southern Idaho and Oregon. We are looking forward to getting lots of good use out of them."
5,Heavy Duty,These are fantastic leather chaps.You will hardly find a better deal on quality chaps.Order 2 sizes larger. They look much better than the pictures show.
2,Sizing is inacurate,"Good quality and construction but the sizing is incorrect. You have to have chicken legs for these to fit. After not paying attention to the size chart on the mfg web site I ordered the wrong size. Normally you should order one size larger than your normal clothes, after all this is another layer you are putting on. The company is very easy to work with on size exchanges and offers a fast turn around. But even after exchanging for a pair 4 sizes larger than my normal clothes size they still do not fit. I like my normal clothes to fit loose so a couple sizes larger should be hanging off me but in order to get into these chaps i'm going to need some butter and forget about sitting down or bending my knees... then again if i can't get on my bike, i don't have to worry about protection."
4,Chaps,I really like the chaps. Good quality for the price. I didn't give them a 5 because they were a bit long.
3,Auntie Mayhem,"Ms. Fyfield is an intelligent and talented writer indeed (though perhaps a bit too clever, since her plots tend to get bogged down in abstruse cleverness), but I would like to read one of her books in which a sympathetic female character is not tortured, beaten up, or mutilated in a particularly graphic way. This one is no exception, involving nasty, bloody, unanesthetized torture in a dentist's chair. What she puts her women through! And why, one wonders? Is this our punishment for just wanting a good read and taking her away from her law practice? Give us a break!"
1,It doesn't work for me,"Even with the telephone assitance of a Microsoft Word expert, I have been unable to upgrade my Word 98 1 version to the 2004 Version, so the product has been no good for me."
1,Microsoft Arrogance,"I was unable to use the product because of Microsoft's inflexible policy on upgrades. For the upgrade to work, they require you to have the old disk, period. I had the old manual and my owner's ID no. but they would not accept this as adequate proof of ownership. When I pointed out to their customer support rep that the other major software companies all accepted this proof, she made an insulting remark and cut me off."
3,"Warped, warts and all.","Jordan R. Young returns to a subject he originally covered in the 1984 ""Spike Jones and His City Slickers"", in a somewhat expanded format. His revised version is far and away the definitive work on an incredibly complex entertainer. Jones comes across in the work as a man for whom show-business was truly a business, and a ruthless one at that. His habit of stealing credit for all manner of innovations developed by his band members makes him appear the Tom Edison of Corn, in more ways than one. While the book is highly informative -- particularly in the biographical appendix of the band members -- it suffers from atrocious editing."
1,failed before grass was even wet,"Very good past experience with Gilmour, a impulse sprinkler I've been using for years and great customer service including sending replacement parts for something I fully admitted to ""weedeating.""Upon dropping and breaking my previous Gilmour I decided to get another and picked out this more accessorized version over the simpler, all-metal one. The plastic hose connector collar split, blowing the hose off the sprinkler before I could even get it to the grass. I was even using the quick connector that came with the sprinkler. Took this back and p/u the all-metal which is presently watering my yard.Quite concerned that this may be a move toward ""price-point"" products for Gilmour which would be a sad, sad development."
2,Almost useful...,"Maybe if this sprinkler had a spike so you could keep it in the same place it would be useful.It took forever to get it set close to what I wanted (I have a huge and strangely-shaped oak in the middle of my yard, so I can't place the sprinkler there)and the second you move it, you really have to reset it all over again. The adjustments weren't fine enough for me either.And it's not obvious how to adjust it. You raise and lower the red track, and the track *behind* the nozzle determines how far the water shoots in the opposite direction. The higher the track - the shorter the stream. Really *not* intuitive."
2,Great idea with a serious flaw,"I had high hopes for this sprinkler based on the reviews here, and it seemed great at first. The sprinkler is well designed, and the adjustable pattern really works well to fit any shaped yard. Unfortunately, the sprinkler has a serious flaw. Grass that is close to the sprinkler gets a much heavier amount of water than the grass on the perimeter. Using this sprinkler for several weeks in the hot summer left me with a circle of lush green lawn surrounded by brown and burned grass. I wouldn't recommend this sprinkler."
2,My LAst Sprinkler,"After the gradener breaking the first three of these sprinklers over the past two years., this one quit working all on it own about a week after receiving it. The sprinkler head will not rotate when the water is turned on, when its off it turns freely, but as soon as the water is turned on it quits rotating. I think I find a less expensive more durable sprinkler to replace this last one."
3,"Works well, but not durable","I bought one of these last year, but the red ring (which functions as a height adjustable cam) broke within a few weeks of use. Might have been a manufacturing defect, but still, it didn't impress me..."
5,Great watering tool for lazy people!,"We are now the envy of the neighborhood! Our lawn is evenly watered all over now that we have this sprinkler. We never were very good at setting our watches to drag a sprinkler all over the yard to ensure we got every spot. Now we just set it out in its designated spot, turn the water on and watch our neighbors drag their sprinklers all over the place!It's extremely simple to use too. With one hand you can either pop up or down sections of the middle ring to adjust the distance of the spray. I now curve around my landscaping, but also make an extra shot out to the mailbox to water the petunias without having to water the entire sidewalk.So simple, yet brilliant! And I don't have any fears of this sprinkler breaking or wearing out like I have with other sprinklers."
4,Works As Advertised,I've had one of these for three years. It really works as advertised. The sprinkler pattern can be adjusted to keep the water on the grass not on sidewalks and fences. I would give it 5 stars but the hose connection is plastic and prone to stripping.
1,Mine stopped turning after a short while,I have bought several of these sprinklers and after a while they stopped turning round. I want to know what to do about this situation.[[Turbine Rotor Sprinkler With Metal Spike Base 200MMS]]Gilmour 999ZS Extra Large Coverage Sprinkler
5,Watchwolf,"Got to tell you this is the best sprinkler I have ever purchased. My husband bought 2 of these 17 yrs ago. I'm not kidding. To this day I have one unit left which just died on me. Looked last year and could not find replacements. Well, today I was lucky enough to find them. I have very different areas in my yard to water. These guys work great. I just hope these last as long as my others. Little silicone spray on the plastic and it works like bran new. Thanks Gilmour! No one else can compare to this sprinkler."
4,What's with the sand ?,"Very nice product ,my wife loved it but...The pockets and linning had sand, yes sand. and not even a little sand ,we're talking a handfull of it.other than that ."
5,"great product, well worth the money!","I have a 2002 GMC Sierra which had the factory stereo system. I wanted to upgrade my system to handle the new Pioneer bluetooth head unit. I just wired this connector to the pioneer head unit's wiring harness. Colors match and everything. Plug it in to the factory harness on 1 end, and into the new head unit on the other end! That simple, and most importantly, no need to cut the factory plug off and splice the wires in the car!"
1,Wrong connector - doesn't work for 93 Old's,When I put my 1993 Oldsmobile into the drop down menu to check for which wiring harness connector I would need this is the one that comes up. You would think that would be correct since the description says for 1988 and up GM. However this connector will not work at all.The correct connector is the Metra 70-1677-1 ; 12 pin and that is what I ordered the second time. If Scosche can't get their descriptions right I'll switch to Metra.I wouldn't trust the Amazon menu of what works and doesn't work as it says the above mentioned Metra will not work. Just don't place your order until you have examined all the wiring to know what you actually are going to need.
5,awesome,"Unit works well, was easy to hook up. the wire colors matched the radio making it easy. Had no problems"
3,It's alright.,"It would help if it had directions, so that you know what clips from the wiring harnesses fit into it. But it fits in a 94 silverado perfectly."
5,1997 C1500 wiring harness,"Great product...easy install, you dont have to be a professional car stereo installer to put a new radio in your vehicle..just follow instructions took me about 20 minutes to install..."
1,HORRID!,Supposed to fit 1988 and up GM vehicles and according to specs would definately fit my 1991 Astro Van.......... NOT EVEN CLOSE! Waste of my money even it it was not a lot
5,Saves your vehicle harness!,"I used this GM Connector in my 1999 Chevy Tahoe and I was leery at first, because it claims GM from 1986 and up, but as advertised, it worked like a dream. If you've never used the vehicle connectors, they are awesome because you don't have to cut your vehicle harness out. The other great thing about using them is you don't have to be in the car, in a cramped space when you are using them. You can splice the wires from the connector to your stereo in your garage or anywhere else you have space. These are always the way to go when you put a new stereo in. Lastly, the wires were really easy to figure out. They ship it with a diagram, but it's also written right on the wire where it goes."
5,Quality Product,This product worked very well in hooking up an aftermarket radio in a GMC 1500 series pickup. The wires are colored in the standard colors so matching them up was a ease. Even if the colors do not match the manufacturer labeled the wires and put the color coding on the package as a backup. I have been installing audio equipment for over a decade and I enjoy when the task is made easier with quality parts.
5,Foundation is right!,"The title fits. This was the birth of reggae with Jamaica's Jazz and R&B; supergroup the Skatalites in the 1960s. Hear them back up Bob Marley dn the Wailer's first record ""Smmer Down"" and you will do just the opposite. Enjoy ""Exodis,"" Cool Smoke,"" and their lovely rendition of ""I Should Have Known Better"" (aka Independent Anniversary Ska).But the real bonus here is the late great genius Don Drummond's wailing trombone in ""Eastern Standard Time."" Why more people in the uSA aren't familiar with this is a mystery. But in either case, this is one of those happy Cds that is recommended listening after a hard day."
2,Great while it lasted...,"This pizza pan made truly great, extraordinary pizzas with perfect crust. However, after I used it about 5 times, the baking surface started ""delaminating."" That is, the baked-on porcelain coating started coming off in spots. I returned it and got a Lodge cast-iron 14"" pizza pan in its place. I hope it will produce as good a pizza without coming apart."
3,great pan with a poor handle.,"After reading reviews about the fragile handle..i still ordered believing not all customers get poorly packed stuff. But i got the same chipped sides and broken handle one. The pan was heavy and perfect to bake pizza and also for south indian dosa. But if u dont mind a pan without a handle ...u can go ahead and order it...I dont know if anyone from amazon reads the reviews about this product...if they have done so, i might have got a cool product. I have already returned it."
5,pizza pan,"This is a wonderful pizza pan. Makes great pizza and is easy to clean, although, it's a little heavy."
1,Horrible package,"We never did get this item for keeps. It was shippped and sent back twice. We gave up and got our money back. The packaging was horrible. Worst I've ever seen. I've seen hard-back books shipped better than this item.The pans' handles are delicate. Each time it arrived, a handle was broken due to poor packing. The product seemed great. They just need to pack it, to hold up to the shipping."
3,pizza pan,Arrived on time as advertised. I think the pan would be better if it were flat - without the lip around the edge.
1,How many times are they going to ship this item!,"This pan arrived in its original box packed in a large box with very little packaging. The original box was wrapped with so much tape that I am convinced it has been sent to more than 20 people. More so, I am convinced that it has been sent BROKEN - both handles sheared off - to more than 20 people. Please pull this item from your stock Warehouse personnel. The pan is CHEAP. Don't buy it new or otherwise."
4,Batali Pizza Pan,"The Batali pan is a lot heavier than expected but the handles make it easy to manage. I've only tried using the pan to bake pizza so far and, using my favorite pizza crust recipe, the pan proved to be a very worthwhile investment. I like that it baked the crust quickly at a lower oven temperature than was required with baking stones. It also does an excellent job of drying out the crust to make a nice crunchy feel. That's the way we like our pizza. I'm looking forward to trying it on a few other items - pancakes, roasted vegetables, etc. The pan is definitely worth the price."
3,Bad Package,"I want to give it a good review but because the pan arrived with a broken handle, I can't say I actually used it.The packaging from Amazon's Warehouse Deals subsidiary was terrible."
2,Origami,"Origami may be an ancient oriental art, but Mr. Nakamura has turned it into something very complicated. Quick & Easy Flying Origami is quite contrary to the title. The instructions are difficult to follow so there is nothing quick and easy about the book. To make any of the airplanes in the book fly, Mr. Nakamura needs to have a few lessons in engineering and avionics because many of the models in the book do not fly. I spent a lot of money on this and it is impossible to use. If you are interested in paper airplanes, I suggest designing your own. Yours will probably be easier to make and will to-say-the-least, fly."
2,Smaller but weaker,"We've had a model KX-TG2216FV for years and loved it, but I thought a smaller unit would be easier for the living room so tried this one. Plus, the blinking antenna to indicate voice mail sounded like a nice feature.That feature, however, isn't turned on by default. Neither are several others. Unlike other phones, cameras, MP3 players, and many other devices, you'll probably want to actually use the manual and consider each setting, as the menu defaults are in some instances odd.The sound quality is initially what you would (and we did) expect from a Panasonic, but the battery drain is poor and the volume drops off in long calls (within ten minutes). And while we've had no problems with DSL, as reported by another reviewer, we do agree with the concerns raised about keypad lighting.On balance, I'd recommend the KX-TG2216FV instead. This one isn't that much smaller, and the weaker features make it a weaker choice."
2,Poor Recption,"The phone has many features but experiences a variety of distortion within close range, additional disnance is even more difficult. The unit does not work well with DSL.Panasonic phones are genrally superior with regard to sound quality but this procudt clearly missed the mark."
5,Another great Pern book!,"Continuing in time after Dragonflight, Dragonquest is just asgood and we learn more about some of the other charactersfrom Dragonflight. (i.e. F'nor"
3,It's okay.,"I must say, the book was okay. But not exactly what I expected from my favorite author. No offense intended. I just feel, as some others, that Lessa's role IS diminished in this book, whereas she was my favorite character in DRAGON FLIGHT. I do like F'nor's role, though. Quotes my friend: ""F'nor is cool""! I have been a sci-fi buff since my mother let me read DRAGON SONG for the first time. I like most of Anne McCaffrey's books, but this one surprised me. I must say that I don't really like the way this book is plotted.Thank you."
3,e-book request,there a those of use who would like this book in e-book form. the only reason i bought it in audio book form was that it is the only book in the series that isn't in e-book form for my kindle. I don't like audio books.
5,Read it in a matter of days,I can't believe that this is one of the last books I read in this series!!! It really answered a lot of questions
5,Amazing,"Love this book series! Read it as a kid an going back and reading it again, it's so much better!!"
3,"Kindle, 3/4 of the way through, love the book but typos abound","So I'm reading the Kindle edition. The editing of this was absolutely atrocious. I'm 3/4 of the way through it, I love it so far, but I'm just fed up with typos. I just got to page that's missing most of the end of a sentence. There's just a large space where an entire line should be. In some places it's barely intelligible. I kept wondering what some of these strange words were, I like to think I have a pretty decent vocabulary but when the kindle's dictionary has no idea what a word is, I can guess it's a typo (I had to assume ""acerbating"" was ""exacerbating"").I mean really, come on. I should probably have tried the 3 book trilogy edition but I can't complain too much since I got it from the library. If I had actually paid for it, I'd be pretty pissed."
1,A Warning to Kindle Purchasers,"If you buy this book in the Kindle edition, be prepared for numerous typos, missing or spurious punctuation marks, and bizarre word substitutions (i.e., ""disable"" instead of ""dissemble""). It appears that the Kindle edition was rushed into publication by hiring an extremely sloppy typist to transcribe the printed edition into an electronic file, and no proofreading was done. If you don't care about such things, the story is decent, but really this is a terrible job of production."
2,Many Errors.,"I have read all of Anne McCaffery's wonderful Pern books. They are five star books. I checked out this Kindle edition from the Public Library. It contains so many typos, grammatical errors, and incorrect words, that reading it was definitely less enjoyable than reading the hprinted book. For example, one sentence said that a dragonrider ""mourned"" his dragon when it should have said he ""mounted"" his dragon. I had been considering purchasing Kindle books, but given the shoddy proofreading of this and other kindle books I've read, I think I'll stick with printed books or see if Nook books are better."
5,Another smash!!,"This second entry in the Pern series is yet another great attachment to my bookshelves. In this we are introduced to the fire lizards, flying lizards that can breathe fire/attach themselves to Pernesians just as the dragons do/annoyances in some cases, and we begin to see the downfall of the ""united"" feeling among Dragonriders. Greed and tradition take over for some of the oldtimers, and then things begin to heat up for a controling figure.Only one complaint... the names. At some times (like at 3am) its somewhat hard to differentiate F'lar and F'nor and such... but that complaint isn't worth taking away anything from the well deserved rating!"
5,Odd situation arose with this CD,"The CD was delivered quickly, but required professional help (the Apple Genius Bar) to transfer it to my computer. Frustrating. Still don't know what that was about."
5,Anne McCaffreys Dragon Pern Stories,"I love the style of Anne McCaffrey's books. Holding my interest while intertaining.I have read everyone of her books even reread them. I have also gave some as Christmas gifts to my grandchildren, who loved them also.You can never go wrong with these books!!!"
4,Wonderful book- but Kindle Ed. has too many errors,"The multitude of typos in the Kindle edition is extremely annoying. If I wasn't already familiar with the book, and re-reading it, I might not be so willing to keep reading. Four stars for Dragonquest, negative stars for whomever botched the Kindle edition."
4,A Good Reason to Keep Reading,"Dragonquest is the only book in the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey that I would not give five stars, but in this case, that isn't a bad thing.This book is a continuation of the story begun in Dragonflight (I request you read Dragonflight before Dragonquest to save yourself endless trouble). Lessa, F'lar, F'nor, and the others have returned to continue in their endless quest to guard Pern from the deadly Thread. This time, new, interesting characters are introduced, and many surprising events occur. Dragonquest also brings the return of the legendary firelizards, 'miniature dragons' that the dragons of Pern were supposedly evolved from. The firelizards lead our Pernese friends on even more adventures that are thrilling, romantic, and suspenseful.As I said, I did not give this book a five for a good reason. The ending of Dragonquest leaves much suspense, taking it a point down, but gives you an excellent reason to read the next book, The White Dragon."
5,One of the Best,From all of the Fantasy and Sci-Fiction books I have read this one book of the trilogy is just outstanding. The characters are very likable and the story line reads well. After finishing reading this one I couldn't wait to get to the rest of them.
4,THE book!,"Anne McCaffrey is the best author! This book is definatley one of her best! You absolutely fall in love with all of the characters, especially Brekke. It's kinda sad at the end, but it's still a great book!!!!"
5,MUST HAVE!,"I don't give out compliments easily, much less take the time to review CD's(unless i'm paid for it). This is where the exception to the rule applies. This CD is a MUST HAVE for any serious blues fan. Very few entertainers have what is referred to as ""IT"". I can't define ""IT"". whatever""IT"" is, Billy Marquis has enough of ""IT"" for three or four people! I'd play it on my radio station everyday"
4,Great regional sound of the Delta,"Billy can knock out Delta Blues with the best of them. The Blues and Beyond is well performed, the music is tight and together, and clearly heartfelt. His voice is just rough enough to make this guy sound like he's lived through the rough times that are so well reflected through the blues. Billy makes you believe he lives the blues every day, yet you know he's enjoying every minute he plays. The selections on this disc are varied, some traditionally filled with gloom, some even mellow. A good first album."
4,Good range of music,"I like a lot of music by the Battlefield Band, and this collection was, not surprisingly, quite good. It had a good range of songs and showed the talent of the musicians. Very enjoyable."
5,Great Event w/ one of the all time best matches ever....,"This was the first wrestling ppv I ever bought back in 1992. Yes a WCW ppv...and its still stands as a great show with one of the best Main Event and/or Cage Matches of all Time. War Games 1992 was downright amazing. all the hype in the reviews on this board...its all true. And if you havent seen it...find a way to see it. Its got everything, wrestling, hardcore, old school high flying, blood, even a couple weapons and they break down the ropes...just years ahead of its time. I personally believe this is the best War Games ever. Even better then the first 2. The undercard was also pretty good for the time, Steiners vs Fujinami/Iizuka was very stiff, Pillman vs Zenk was a great old school highflying/wrestling match. The Opening Freebirds vs Taylor/Valentine was exciting especially with the fans who were great the entire show. Very loud (almost NWA style) Check it out, its sadly, a forgotten classic."
5,Showtime will never be the same,If you like james brown then this collection is for you. If you love old nasty funk then go out and get.
5,Swing is his thing,"This rare recording of Benny Goodman shows the expansive side of this great clarinet player. Some of the tunes - most of which are old standbyes - truly ""rock,"" if such a word can be used. The recording and sound quality is also very good for the time period. I would highly recommend this CD to all Goodman aficionados and clarinet lovers as well as general listeners who like swinging big-band jazz with some gusto."
4,Very good item,Its working very good. Comply or exeed my expectation. It need to manufacture more carefuly because betwen two of the top volumes buton has a litle break.
2,Meah,Not a great book and my wife made fun of me for reading it. You wont get any daddy points by showing this one off.
2,A bit heavy on the 'facts',"I don't think I've ever worked so long and hard to get through a fiction book. It's not that it was a bad storyline; in fact, towards the end it was really quite engrossing. But to start off with it was very convoluted and slow. There was a lot of mythology and history, which would have been interesting if you weren't also trying to keep track of the plot at the same time. And it's considered a juvenile book! After all was said and done it was worth it, though, because it was an interesting story. I just don't know - if this is indicative of all of his work - that I want to slog my way through another one of his books."
2,Unfinished and undisciplined,"If you think that Card's quality has declined since Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, then stay away from this book as well. Card's editors just don't demand enough from him. Enchantment feels unfinished and unedited, overly long with surprises popping out of nowhere. Characters are not up to Card's standards. It's also consciously gender-roled (only women have magic at all), and the end dodges all the cultural conflicts set up in the beginning for a suddenly smooth ""happily ever after."""
4,Unique and Powerful,"A great stand-alone piece of fiction. Very well researched russian fairy-tale structure. A magical world like none other you have ever experienced. The magic feels so believable, you might just find yourself looking around the woods for a sleeping maiden."
4,Fun Merging of Reality and Fantasy,"Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors, while I feel he has had some hits and misses for me this one I truly enjoyed.This story tells the tale of a merging of worlds, the world of the many gods and the worshippers of them with todays modern society. By mixing old world mythology (not greek) and hiding it within todays society you get a tale that, while it has been seen before, carries the reader through a fun adventure."
4,"Good book, but far from my favorite OSC","Modern scholar Ivan Smetski returns to his native land of the Ukraine to work on his Phd dissertation on Proto-slavic fairy tales. But instead of studying the old stories, he ends up living one when he stumbles upon an ensorcelled, beautiful woman lying on a pedestal in the woods.But the story really is about what happens AFTER he kisses sleeping beauty and is then end up back in her time (9th Century). OSC did a good job of portraying how a time traveler would struggle with the change and also how the native people would view him.And of course, as part of the story the times are switched and Ivan takes his princess back to his time - I had a harder time seeing this as realistic.Either way, this was a good read. OSC always does a great job with the underlying themes. This book seemed to be about marriage - in particular how men and women think and view the world differently"
5,wonderful fantasy,"In ""Enchantment"" Orson Scott Card skillfully blends fantasy, science fiction, adventure and romance. It is a true showcase of the author's talent. The story is based around the idea of ""What if fairy tales were true?"" The plot hinges around time travel between 9th Century Russia and the 1990's. The key plot device is used well and never seems too unbelievable.The author has obviously carefully researched the history of 9th century Russia and creates a wonderful picture of life in that world. What makes this book so enjoyable though is not just the combination of literary genres, but the fact that the main characters are well developed and can carry the story. A lot of science fiction and fantasy contains one dimensional characters. Here you can truly empathise with and understand the motives of all the main characters.I enjoyed reading Orson Scott Card's Ender series. This book is even more enjoyable. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
3,"""modern day fairy tale""","I like OSC's style a lot and have enjoyed much of his stuff. This book, however, seems like it was a pet project of his. I didn't really come away from it with anything. It was fun to read, but not too satisfying. I lump it in the same category as Harry Potter, except the plot of Enchantment is just simple twists on old fairy tales."
5,love it!,"I have never heard of the author, but regardless I don't really take note of any authors of all the books I read. But this book, the cover and the title stands out. Yes, i judge a book before i read it. I truly didnt think i would enjoy reading it, but i did. Since the first time i borrow from the public library to read it, i went out to purchase the book and read it three more times. The story, with a mixed of fairy tale and mystery was enough to lead me to finish the book in one sitting (well actually one day). its really a wonderful book if one likes to read a modern day version of fairy tales. A little romance, a little magic, a little mystery that keep you guessing until the end."
5,Awesome.,"This book is one of my favorite books. As a big fantasy fan, this was different than Card's usual work. I was expecting it to be more science fiction.The hero was portrayed so beautifully and the plot, though familiar (sleeping beauty), was clever and intriguing. I have read this book over 10 times and still am not sick of it!"
5,Delightful exploration of very unique perspectives,"This is one of Card's best. I read it at about the same time as Ender's Shadow. Enchantment is MUCH better (and I liked Ender's Shadow).This is a must-read for anybody who is even vaguely interested in Ukrainian history, Jewish folk tales, or modern neo-Paganism. The story is compelling and captivating, but one thing I especially enjoyed was the rationalization of Germanic paganism and magic. I doubt any other book has combined such things into a very Jewish-Christain romance tale."
2,pretty bad,"Here's a very easy test to tell whether you'll like this book or not. Do you A) like sophisticated, at least somewhat intellectually stimulating fantasy literature or do you B) like silly, sappy harlequin romances with a dash of uninventive fantasy? If you answered B) this book is for you. As for myself, I found myself cringing through what I read (3/4 of it) before I finally gave up in disgust and just skimmed the rest. It started off good, but there was just too much cheesy romance to appreciate the fantasy.*however* I will say this. I think a younger audience would probably like it. I know that if I were considerably younger (12 or so), I probably would have really liked it.... though, come to think of it, I've read a lot of YA material and rarely is it this cheesy... Waste your time with this book at your own risk"
1,It's no Ender's Game,"This book was a big disappointment. Not Card at his best. Some mildly funny anachronism jokes didn't make up for the overworked, overworked and overworked insipid fairy tale theme."
3,"Good book, but some parts were just silly.","True, you need to suspend reality in order to believe in the magic and story of the world, but when you have things like building a hang glider AND being able to fly decently without any training whatsoever, it gets sort of silly for me. It was a good story, don't get me wrong, but some of the writing and ideas, just seemed so adolescent. Still, the book kept me gripped with the character development."
1,Disappointing,"After Ender's Game I find it hard to believe that OSC wrote something so trite, so unimaginative. It starts off OK, but then gets terrible once you realize where he's going with it. Nothing creative, totally predictable. Don't waste your time."
3,A sleepy beaut,"Enchantment is a spring fancy. A book that is pleasant to read in a warm sunbeam, contemplating nothing, just simply enjoying the pages as they flip by. There is nothing deep to Enchantment. It is a cute and modern reworking of Sleeping Beauty.The book contains some twists and turns. Card readers will recognize some of his usual characterization quirks. The plot is a bit loose, the dialog is great and the description is fast and free. Which makes Enchantment very much like what readers have come to expect from Card in the past decade. Enjoyable but not world changing. Enjoy."
5,"Card at his best, creating moral dilemmas & keeping us happy","Great fantasy, not an elf, dwarf or quest in sight. Leave it to Card to create an alien moral dilemma in ninth century Carpathia that makes you examine your own life.And you thought Capathia was where the bad guy from Ghostbusters II came from! Get some culture. Read this book."
5,Awesome.,"This is an awesome story. The characters are well developed, the story is captivating, the writing is (as is always true with OSC) superb!"
2,"Really wanted to like this, love 'Ender's Game,' but I didn't like this story at all...","After reading and loving (and re-reading)Ender's Game: Battle School, I really wanted to love this book by Orson Scott Card. I didn't. I found the dialogue tedious and awkward. Sadly, I liked this book less thanMagic Street, which I recently read on myKindle Paperwhite, 6"" High Resolution Display with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers(which I *LOVE*) and didn't even like all that much. That book I managed to finish, this one I couldn't even get into chapter two. Other readers have written glowing reviews, so don't take my word for the caliber of this book. The beauty and power of the written word, like other forms of art, is entirely subjective. Avail yourself of Amazon's terrific ""look inside"" the book feature or request a sample for your Kindle eReader. You may really like or love this story. Happy Reading~*"
4,A 4 Star Read,A classic story. Hero falls for a girl while embarking on a magnificent quest. A great romance for the literary set.
2,just o.k.,This book is just okay. The basic story is interesting but contains too much about bodily functions and parts for my taste.
1,Overblown attempt at a modern-day fairytale,"People, get a grip. Mr. Card's a fine writer, but this book's just not all that good. It's a fairy tale, true, but the Good characters are SO good and the Bad characters are SO bad that there is virtually no tension in this story. Will Good triumph over Evil? DUH. Will Fathers be wise and sons obedient (so they can become wise fathers)? DITTO. Will there be the usual OSC lectures on Christian morality and family values along the way? You betcha. Card's characters have never inhabited a morally complex universe where doubt plagues people to the end of their days and the outcomes of stories--like those in life--are unforeseeable. For me, I fell off the Orson Scott Card bandwagon when he sold the Book of Mormon to Tor as a five-part science fiction series, his Homecoming ""epic"". I thought I'd give him another chance with this book. Silly me."
3,Dissapointing and Lack of Development,"I've been an Orson Scott Card reader for many years and this book was quite disappointing. The dialogue was stilted, unnatural and the characters poorly developed. I don't know when Card wrote this book, but it reads like it was written by someone writing for the first time.The basic story is good but the plot could have had better development and flow. The ending was a bit of a let down and a little to obvious. So unlike the Card I've come used to reading.I don't say you shouldn't read this book -- but if you're seeking Card's usual excellence you won't find it here. Read it much like a child's tale -- along with the underdeveloped grammar and 5th grade reading level."
2,Not up to the standards Card has had in the past,Having read many of Card's books I was very disappointed with the quality of this new offering. It seems that over the years he has become more enamored with the carnal side of writing. What could once be considered a small part of the text has now become so pervasive as to dilute any story or plot line he is trying to tell. It seems that Mr. Card is drifting to the side of the sensational and abandoning the real art of story-telling. I was so disappointed with this book that I couldn't finish... a first for me.
3,Too Long,"Well this book was just too long, it drug for me. It was so violent and even had some nudity. Not what I was expecting. The love story was sweet and the whole story idea was good, but I like a nice sweet fairy tale without all the violence."
2,Hard to get through,"All types of holes in the plot and in the characters. I found myself skipping through huge sections of the book. Human dynamics a bit unrealistic as are the relationships. I had high hope, but this was a disappointment. This is definitely tedious and the melding of the past/future plus the inclusion of gods/magic was overreaching. Combat depictions were very contrived."
5,This will stay with you for a very long time..,"I originally read this book in high school. I was just flipping through the shelves at my school library and came a across it. It looked interesting, so I picked it up and checked it out, the rest is history.I could not put this book down. I read it within 24 hours and was sad when it ended. I have never been so enthralled in a book such as this. I reluctantly brought it back the next day to check out something else.That was nearly 8 years ago and no matter how much time passes, I still remember this book and keep on coming back to it. Buy it! You won't regret it. -- no matter how old I get, I will still pick this novel off the shelf and read it as many times as I can.Orson Scott Card is a genius in and of himself. This Book in my opinion is a masterpiece -- a hidden gem that is relatively unknown to the masses, but should be."
2,Disappointing,"I love much of Card's work. Ender's Game was wonderful. Alvin Maker is one of my favorites. I've read almost everything Card wrote and until the last two books, I didn't think he could write something I wouldn't like. Enchantment was cheesy and I didn't finish it. The book I read just before this one, Magic Street, was also a rehash of other tales. It was like he ran out of his own ideas and had to use someone else's. But he took the magic out of other worlds and tried to put it into this one and for me, it just didn't work. I might have to re-read something else he wrote just to remember why I liked his writing so much."
5,Enchantment is nothing short of extraordinary!,Enchantment is the best thing Card has put out since Ender's Game. It is much more accessible than some of his science fiction (which I also love). What a wonderful way to retell a fairy tale. Card has a way of pulling the reader inside the story-the characters become as real as any person you have ever known. Anyone who loves the story of Sleeping Beauty will love this book.
5,Learn the unspeakable truth hidden in Russian folklore,"Not a typical Card book, but then, what exactly is a ""typical Card book""?It starts with a beautiful portrayal of a Jewish Boy growing up in Russia, moves to some gritty ""it-sounded-good-in-theory"" fantasy, which in turns alternates with fairy-tale fantasy. The fairy-tales are appropriately Russian, and along the way the truth behind many classical Russian folklore stories is revealed.Yes, it's as funny as it sounds.Add to that great Orson Card characters, and the strength his moral believes often lend to his books, and you get what would have been considered a masterpiece if written by anyone else. I haven't read his biblical series, but it compares well to his terrific ""Hart's Hope"" fantasy, blows his horror books out of the water, and is at least on par with his SF.I can't believe no one noticed this book, maybe because it's mostly fantasy. Highly recommended, even to those who think they only like Card for his SF."
3,A Good Book!!!,"This is one of the best books with a twisted fairy tale story I have ever read. Who ever knew that Disney had not perfected the story of Cinderella. Try this book, it's good."
5,Can there be anyone better than Orson Scott Card?,"I almost didn't buy this book because the title and the cover art seemed a little feminine. But then I said to myself, ""Hey, this guy has never written ANYTHING I didn't love. So I bought the book and realized something: Orson Scott Card could probably write a grocery list that would be more interesting than most of what's on the shelf today! Buy the book. Don't be stupid. (Like I nearly was.) Card, you da'MAN!"
4,simply enchanting,"When I first bought this book i thought it was going to be boring, not for me i'm a teen i don't read fairy tales. Then I thought Card wrote it there must be something to it... I found out that card really is a story teller. Card has made more then a ancient tale with a modern twist but it also has something that can excite the reader and it makes u cheer with all your heart for the charachters hoping that this prayer would make the charachters win the battle. If you are the person that likes aliens and spaceships this probably isn't the book for you but it also has a great battle scene. Don't b caught up in the begining where there is a little too much description."
5,Couldn't put it down!,One of the best books I had read in a long time. I was craving something different than what I normally read and this was certainly it. Very romantic!! I'm a librarian and I will recommend it to everyone who wants to read something different!
5,Awesome Book! Card just keeps getting better!,"This book is fantastic! It's unlike any other I've read. I reccomend it to any one that likes Sci-Fi, fantasy, action, romance, or just wants a good book."
4,Good Card is better than great from most other authors,"I agree with some of the nitpicking stuff, but the bottom line is this is just a really good, engaging story. It's not something you'll make all your friends read like Ender's Game, but it is something you will suggest to them."
4,Creativity!,This book is creativity at its finest. Orson Scott Card continues to do what I have grown to love. He can create a world from seemingly nothing. I have never read anything bad from him.
2,interesting premise but ends up flat and ordinary,"I listened to Enchantment by Orson Scott Card (of Ender's Game fame - still one of my favourite books) on audiobook, because I had some long trips coming up. It wasn't a book I had been wanting to read (random pick from the library), but it filled the time quite easily, and I found out that I like to listen to audiobooks while running - yay for multitasking!Enchantment had a promising premise - a modern retelling of the Sleeping Beauty saga. However, it quickly becomes an ordinary but well researched, structured, and paced story about magic and witches in an otherwise muggle world.I will never forget the deep forest with its leaf-filled chasm in the Ukraine where our runner scholar hero, Ivan, finds his 9th century princess Katerina. For that gorgeous magical place alone, I'm grateful. Otherwise, the characters were flat and often stereotypical, and the story not as inventive as I had hoped."
4,Delightful. The perfect mix of fantasy and romance.,"I loved to watch the love evolve between Ivan and Katerina. I felt that throughout the book, Card knew exactly which parts I'd want to hear more of and less of - and he met my needs. I never got bored with this novel. It was my first Card novel and I will return to his writings again."
3,Better Chewed Than Swallowed Whole,"Peacefull Canada. A very cold socialist semi-utopia that most see as crime free.While that narrow view may be true, this book reveals the seedy underbelly and noble brow of Candian justice.This book is a tome. And if you like knowledge at the expense of buckets of gore then read this book. It is graphic enough to rivit your attention (if you skim a little), and very comprehensive.In short - it is a critical criminology reference that isn't a total snoozer."
3,I Love James,"I love James Brown but I mut give this a lower rating only because there are only 3 songs that are excellent on this CD.His other CD's have more of his classic songs all one one Cd.This particular cd music copied most of his more famous songs,I am a musician and I know artist tend to ""sound alike"" on their records. I am not sure if these songs came first but""there it is"", ""Ants in the pants"""", and ""Bodyheat"" are the best songs on this CD(great to dance to)Regina"
5,Awesome Carseat,"We bought this carseat for our son when he was [...] , he is now [...]. We love this carseat. It was easy to install and I love how the straps NEVER twist. EXCELLENT QUALITY!!!"
5,Excellent Car Seat,So many convertibles car seat to choose from but the Britax Marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum.I was very pleased that the Marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness. No other seat that I reviewed offered this feature. I also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap.My son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his Peg Perego Primo Viaggio.(...)They offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color I wanted in stock.I believe I made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments.
5,Chicano History 101,This is great for any student who is studying Chicano History for the first time. Also great for anyone who calls himself Chicano but has no idea of thier past history.
4,"It doesn't claim to be a balanced, unbiased view; only real.","Do not view this film if you are looking for mainstream research style objectivity. Do view this film if you would like to hear the words and see the point of view of an oppressed people. One does not view the writings of the victims of the Holocaust, Slave Trade, or the Native American Genocide as being unbiased, balanced, or academic. These writings and films are the voices of the losers. We live in a time where their voices can help us make winners of all who fall prey to future conflicts. View this film as though it were YOUR ancestors that were oppressed and let the college professors enjoy their self-indulgent auto intellectualism."
2,Time Warp Correct Politics,"This video takes the viewer back to the radical politics of the Sixties. It is utterly biased and unredeemed by any balanced viewpoint and I found it suitable mainly for college courses in political rhetoric, radical communications history, and radical sociology and anthropology."
3,Not Charlie's Best,"Charlie Haden's ""Nocturne"" is one of my all time favorite CDs but this effort falls a little short."
3,Halfway heavenly,"3 1/2Haden adds just enough personalized touch to transcend the slinky confines so many in his genre fall prey to, providing a moody stimulant that neither overwhelms with complexity nor drowns out in melodramatic tension-less playing."
3,"Great product, not great packing.","I have used the Dermalogica special cleansing gel for the past year and have LOVED it. I ordered it from here because of the great price! I received the item in great time, the only complaint I have is that the packaging was awful. The special cleansing gel had leaked and got all over the box because the cap had come loose. It was not a fun package to open at all.Derm Special Cleansing Gel 16.9 oz"
4,Happy with Product,This is a great cleanser to use for the first cleanse of the face. I plan on purchasing this product again.
5,Derrmalogica special cleansing gel,"This is the first time I use this product. I like it, however, I received it without seal and it bothers me until now. When I buy beauty products, this will be very important to me. It is only thing I don't like it."
2,Not worth it,"Pros: Rinses off beautifully; gentle, non-irritating; did not strip my skin or dry it out; natural, unobtrusive fragranceCons: The cleansing action is not very powerful or effective -- left what little makeup I had on my face more or less intact; did not leave my face feeling squeaky clean; although the bottle is rather large, I found that it only lasted for two months; hefty pricetagThere are better, cheaper cleansers out there. In fact, every aesthetician I've known has expressed lukewarm feelings toward the Special Cleansing Gel, offering many more effective alternatives. The search for the perfect cleanser certainly does not end with Dermalogica."
5,Best Face Cleansing Formula,I have been using Dermalogica products for over a decade and I don't know what it is about the Special Cleansing Gel but it smells delicious and seems to work with all skin types. I always feel refreshed and polished after using this nice sudsing cleanser
5,Great for sensitive skin!,Love Dermalogica and have been using this product for a couple of years now with great results. The lack of scent also is a great selling point for me.
1,Total Fraud,I have been using this cleanser for 2 years. So I know the product. The 2 bottles I purchased are fakes. Total Fraud. Will definitely reconsider purchasing from amazon.
1,bad choice,"I bought this item with active tone and active moist, this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types. I never had any acne problem, I never had any skin problem before, I was using Babe until now and my skin was perfect even when I was at 17s I never had any acne problem. But since I started using this product my skin became awful, it is unbelievable, I paid a lot of money and I can not use it, if I attempt to use it, in 1-2 days I start having at least 4-5 strange acnes all over my face. I strongly not recommend anyone to buy it."
5,Love It!!!,I have used this product for almost two years. I love Dermalogica! I started using it at the recommendation of my Dermatologist. I never have break outs and my skin feel so soft since I have been using this cleanser.
5,Love this!,I have been using Dermalogica products for 15 years! They are the best. And Special Cleansing Gel is the only product that makes my face feel clean - it removes all my makeup but is not too drying. The prices at Amazon were the best I found!
2,Dermalogica cleansing gel and microfoiliant,"The first time I bought Dermalogica from Amazon the product was not a ""knock off"".I believe (for sure) this time the microfoliant and cleansing gel are acounterfeit product. I would not purchase this again from Amazon."
2,Wrong product sent,"Omni solutions sent us "" Essesntial Cleansing Solution"" instead of "" Special Cleansing gel"" and then they sent the replacement via regular First Class mail and it reached us after like 3 weeks because of postal delays. I would have thought they would send it through a faster service sinc eit was their fault. I would avoid them in the future."
5,Simple and clean,A basic non scented cleansing gel that does it's everyday job. Does not dry my skin out and works well with my dermalogica skin smoothing cream.
4,"Very gentle facial cleanser, worth the extra cost","I must say that I was not entirely excited when a friend gave this face wash to me as a gift. Perhaps I should have taken offense? In any case, I looked past that as soon as I tried this wash because it is just so great--just a straightforward, gentle cleanser that does exactly what it's supposed to. With all the face washes available out there, you'd think it'd be fairly easy to pick one up that is no-frills and doesn't hurt your skin but it's been a lot harder for me than it should be. So I'm so grateful that this was given to me, just a great overall cleanser!"
5,BEST CLEANSER I HAVE EVER USED!,"I have super sensitive normal to dry skin with red blotchy patches on my cheeks all year round (not sure what it is from but in Winter my skin gets very red with eczema). I thought I had just about tried every cleanser recommended with no big relief. Someone suggested this brand of cleanser & of course I ""thought"" another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out, WOW what a super pleasant surprise! First off it's quite concentrated so you don't need much (bonus there!) & after washing my face (& I REALLY mean this) for the absolute 1st time my skin felt clean, refreshed, & not all tight & dry as usual! This cleanser is liquid gold to my skin! I love it & would recommend it to anybody. If you think it's maybe to expensive do a search & see if you can find a free sample as I did first but I am certainly ordering a bottle of this! I just can't say anything bad about it & I do speak my mind! Highly recommended:)"
4,A Cleanser without the artificial coloring,This is a clear face wash that I enjoy using. It gently cleans the face without stripping the skin. I would have rated this product a 5 but it contains parabens.Made in the USA
5,Not just for kids!,"The other day, I bought two CDs for my 1 year old. The first was by the Wiggles. The second one was this CD (Folk Playground). Thank goodness I bought the second one. Now I can play accessible and fun music for my daughter and stay sane at the same time! The lyrics are playful and witty, with some artists adding some twists to some old favorites (Victor Johnson - ""This Old Man"", Laurie Berkner - ""Froggie Went a-Courtin'""). The music is mature, pleasant, and of course, folksy. The Zoe Lewis tune, ""Sheep"" is worthy of special mention...a pure delight. But there's not a single clunker on this CD...for the kids or the parents. Are there any more like this out there?"
5,really awesome,This is our absolute favorite kids music CD. All the songs are first rate and lots of fun! This is an absolute must-have for any kids music collection. LOVE it!!
2,"Exactly what we didn't need- ""Tom Joad II""","Springsteen needs to get off his lazy butt and write the novel he so obviously has in him, rather than subjecting us to these self-indulgent, somnolent, tuneless, efforts. Stories are great, but songs need MELODIES! Don't believe me? Well lets do a test--hum a Springsteen song with a great melody, ""Born To Run"" right now. See how easy that was? Now try to hum ""The Hitter"". Need I say more? Now you may say that the title track has a memorable tune, but the thing you may not realize is that Sprinsgteen, in an astonishing display of unoriginality, is has used the same melody in ""Dead Man Walking"" and ""Blood Brothers"". Where are you Jon Landau? Somone needs to give the poor guy some honest criticism. Start with this sentence ""Bruce, that damn twang that you developed about the time of ""Tunnel of Love"" has steadily grown ridiculous."""
3,It's Not the Bruce - you'd Expect,This new cd by Bruce leaves me with a SO-SO feeling. I do like but after a while of listening = at some point I'd wish that he'd suck on a losenger or something.
1,Bruce Is Dead,"He takes lifeless tunes and then cranks it down a notch.If he wants to tell stories, he should write a book."
1,Insipid,Just about unlistenable....talk about an overhyped CD! I have loved Bruce for years - saw him at a college campus back in 1978! But...this is just drivel and hopeless pandering to the passive and left wing. The lyrics are a huge step down from his high standards..
1,Just Shut Up And Sing!!,"The Hype is all that. HYPE! I bought the bossman's album after 9/11 and thought it was ok, but a little over dramatic. This last effore is no more than a political tool from someone that has their head in the sand. If I want the latest on Washington philosophical dribble, I will listen to talk radio, as I do alot. Bruce, Baby, JUST SHUT UP AND SING ALREADY! You sound like a liberal poetic college professor from an Ivy League school! Lame, Lame, Lame!"
1,Dual Disc?,"I am not going to address the content of the disc as I have not been able to hear it yet! I spent over an hour trying to play this disc on my computer. The DVD just skipped around and sounded like static and froze my system several times. The audio CD was not recognized by my computer at all! Since my computer can't recognize the CD, I can't put it on my IPOD. Do they want us to buy the CD and download the album too thereby paying twice? I have not tried it in the car yet, but I fear the results will be the same as others have said. I am a HUGE Boss fan, but this is the most frustrating experience!"
3,music,"Music is each one of us's ""personal taste""- we all make our own decisions-I've foung it best to ""listen & learn! (& I'm a ssslllooowww learner now too!) Enjoy!"
3,My copy is already corrupted and won't play any more.....,"I love the CD, but for some reason, it will no longer play. I don't know if it's because it's a DualDisc, or if it's a leaker. Whatever the reason, I'm miffed, since I now have to buy another one. I wish they would release this on a single ""music"" CD. I may have to break down and buy it directly on MP-3 from Amazon! Shoot!"
5,The Greatest Icon in Rock History,"I was almost floored to see this album receive such a low overall ranking. Oh don't get me wrong, it does not bother me, because I know that it is a brilliant album and anybody that voted for less than four stars is a total idiot. Springsteen amazes me. Thirty years in and he is getting better and better and fresher and fresher. There is nothing dated here, the Boss has evolved. ""Maria's Bed"" and ""Long Time Coming"" are just two of the brilliant songs on this album, an album that sounds many ways like a modern Nebraska. Just brilliant!"
5,Poetic Philosophy,"I am astounded by the number of negative reviews of this album. I think I'm even more astounded that one reviewer cited ""Born in the USA"" as Bruce's only ""good"" album. Somebody's confused! I barely know where to begin...I've been a Bruce fan almost since birth, and each of his albums represents a portion of my childhood, adolescence, etc.When Bruce is at his best (as he is on this album) he invites the listener on a journey...sometimes it's complicated, harsh, dark or challenging...but so is life! Bruce is a poet who offers his philosophies on the world in which we live. Sure, ""Born in the USA"" might have been more ""fun"", but the majority of it wasn't exactly substantial and thought-provoking. He himself has said this. If all you want is synthesized music featuring excessively cheerful teenagers ""singing"" about things they don't understand, go listen to Britney and company. If you actually want to think about the world around you, you can't do any better than this album."
2,"Doesn't this album have that ""DRM Rootkit Virus Vulnerability"" on it?","I think why the iPod-owning reviewers are having problems transferring this ""Dual Disc"" to their iPods is that it may be Copy Protected with that sneaky DRM thing Sony and some other record labels are using.David Byrne (known from the music group ""Talking Heads"") cautions against buying this and a list of about 20 other CD's/Dual Discs which he says can all wreak havoc on your computer if you try to play them. Mr. Byrne is telling his friends not to buy any CD's made after the Foo Fighter's ""In Your Honor"" was released, unless they will never put them in a computer. ""In Your Honor"" was released almost a year ago."
3,Northern Twang?,"I haven't heard anyone else bring this up, but am I the only one confused when I hear a guy from Freehold, N.J. tear through songs with a twang that sounds like he's from Southern Georgia?I starting noticing this a while back and now he's gone all-out with it. Think back to any of his early work and he sings in what I would imagine to be his actual accent & voice. Now he sounds like Steve Earle's uncle or something. Is the Boss disappointed he's not from south of the Mason-Dixon, or what? I don't get it."
2,I like this album but IT WON'T PLAY IN MY CD PLAYER,"This is a good album, no doubt...but word of warning: the record will not play in my home CD player nor will it play in my car's CD player, which leads me to ask: what's the point? I'd rather have a regular CD that plays on any CD player than this dual disc junk that doesn't work right."
4,Give it a chance. It'll grow on you.,"I'm a big Springsteen fan. Favorite album - Tunnel of Love. You'll read reviews that call it a quiet, somber album. That's only upon first impression. I must admit I didn't care for this album upon the first listen. I tucked it away and didn't pick it up for a week. Then I gave it a couple more serious listens and became hooked. While there are no loud, rockin' numbers like on the Rising, there are a number of tunes that quietly groove along very nicely. If you're at all a fan, definitely give the album a few good listening sessions. You'll fall for it!"
2,The rest home album,"I read quite a few comments and no one seems to notice how Bruce has no voice left. Especially noticeable on ""All I'm Thinkin' 'bout."" He gets away with this b/c he's the Boss. anyone else would flop due to a cracking/lost voice."
3,Once again heading down Woody's path...,"DEVILS & DUST continues Springsteen's occasional forays into the land of Woody Guthrie; Bare bones musical settings and telling stories that touch on the human condition. This one is more successful than the painful TOM JOAD, but it still suffers from a sense of ennui.The title cut with line s like ""Fear's a powerful thing It can turn your heart black you can trust,"" is a memorable opener and the bitter taste of ""Reno"" lasts for a long time, but the overall effect is still one of Bruce reaching back for what he found on NEBRASKA and coming up a bit short."
2,I worry about Bruce...,"This is a grim CD. I adore Bruce, but this one is pretty difficult to listen to. The lyrics sound like someone who is dying. I wonder if Bruce is really so horribly disillusioned with life. I think that would be very sad, and that's why I worry about him. I still love to listen to him sing though."
3,"If he's the Boss, I quit","Let's get a few things straight:1. Springsteen never could sing (and the falsetto is even worse than the normal voice);2. Unlike some other vocally-challenged elder statesmen of popular music (Dylan, Neil Young), he has not had an original songwriting idea in more than two decades;3. He is just not very smart, but has been faking it for many years, in part because anyone seems smart to the average Rolling Stone reader (or editor, for that matter).Suffice it to say, I do not particularly like this disc. Worse, I cannot even give it to my wife or 9 year old son (both huge fans of the equally-overrated ""Rising""), thanks to the uncharacteristically vulgar lyrics. I think I should have just listened to Nebraska again instead of buying this disc."
1,TERRIBLE,"There have only been a few CD's that I have thought about asking for my money back and this is one. Yeah ""Devils and Dust"" is a great song, a really great song but that is where anything good about this album ends. The only other B.S. (heh thats funny) album I have owned is Born in the U.S.A. so I admit I'm not a big B.S. fan but man, this thing sucks! The lyrics are stupid and to cover this he MUMBLES his way though them but it doesn't help. The music is dull low-fi crap. My advice is listen to some samples, download the single of Devils and Dust and use the $15 you saved to buy a good CD. I'm sure B.S. has some better ones...."
1,a weak CD,"The marketing is good but, sad to say, the music on this CD is very weak, the guy is an average musician in my opinion."
1,"long time fan, very mad.","bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says ""audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc."" WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES!"
4,Bruce Springsteen Devils and Dust,"This item was delivered in excellent condition. While not one of Bruce's best cd's, it is a very good one. Plus the dvd gives you insite to Bruce's thought process behind several songs creation."
1,I'm DEEPLY OFFENDED,"As a great fan, I have purchased all Springsteen releases (including singles, etc) without complaint. I've had my preferances, of course, but the fact that this CD DOES NOT PLAY on my PC, stereo, or boombox is nothing short of infuriating!As a blue-collar Springsteen devotee, I'm so upset that I need to listen to D&D; on my television.Having listened a dozen times, the songs are decent but nothing like the rawness of Nebraska or the simplicity of Tom Joad. (BTW: I liked both records because I thought they represented new directions...)HOWEVER!The fact that we get TWO songs with RETREAD LYRICS!!! And at least another couple with similar melodies doesn't seem worth the price of hearing Bruce's falsetto.Additionally, those expecting better lyrics here will disappointed.It is -- and I've been buying this guy's records for thirty years and never thought I'd say this-- nothing short of A DISASTER!"
3,Over Produced,"Springsteen needs to get rid of Brenden O'Brien. He did an OK job on the Rising, but then tried his best to bring this album down. Most of the songs on Devils and Dust are good songs which were ruined by horns and strings. I can understand that Springsteen didn't want to make an album too closely resembling Nebraska, but sometimes simplicity is just better. It certainly would have been in this case. I am a huge Sprinsteen fan who really wanted to love this album. But it is merely good, not great."
3,Won't play on my car CD player,"I have only listened to the CD once so won't give it a rating (disregard the 3, Amazon made me choose a rating to proceed), but wanted to issue a heads up about the DualDisc format. The CD side will not play on the CD player in my car. From what I have found online, this is not unusual with DualDiscs. I don't like it when something sold as a CD won't play in a CD player!One comment on the music: I am astonished by the lyrics of ""Reno"". Not offended, astonished. The best way I can think to describe it is poetic pornography. In another sense, it can be viewed as an upraised finger from Bruce to the far right."
4,Another welcome return,"This is Bruce's finest record in a long time. While The Rising was a fine album as well this just beats it by being more concise, better put together, and stronger song for song. In Brendon O'Brien Bruce seems to have found the perfect producer to work with at this stage of his career. As is often the case with Bruce this takes a few spins to get into at first, but once the lyrics and feeling of the album set in then it reveals more and more after each play. I enjoy this record much more than any of his 90's work (there are somber numbers but also some light and up beat songs to help move things along), but can only give it four stars as I wouldn't put it in the same class as ""The Wild the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle"", ""Born to Run"", or ""Nebraska"" say."
3,"I like the album, but...","...you can put me down as not being a fan of the DualDisc format. If you want to give me a CD and include a bonus DVD, that's fine. I like that type of premium packaging. But by sticking the CD and the DVD on the same disc, you're limiting my access to the material. If I happen to leave my DualDisc at work (I listen to CDs at work all day), and then I want to watch the DVD at home that night (or play the enhanced audio version), I'm out of luck. Or if my wife takes the CD in the car grocery shopping, and I want to play the DVD at home, I'm out of luck. I can't believe the cost of including an extra disc would be that much more. Sometimes I think the industry is just trying too hard. Give me a CD and a bonus DVD. You can keep your DualDisc (and the goofy new jewel case it comes in). The album gets 5 stars. The format/packaging gets 1 star. Overall, 3 stars."
1,no thank you,"Thanks to all the reviews already posted I will not buy this cd. If it won't play in my car or in my ipod then why would I even buy it. Those are the only 2 ways that I listen to music. Also, can anybody tell me where you CAN play it? Do you need a new CD player? I'm not being saracastic, I just would like to know if there is some new gadget that is supposed to replace common CD players and common ipods because there has to be SOME WAY to play this CD. I really would like to hear it because I like the Boss, but I think I will wait until a year or two when they re-release it on a better quality CD. They usually do that in situations like this. What a shame. I really really love Nebraska, and from what I am reading from the people who can actually get their CD to work this sounds like Nebraska."
3,Not his best by far,likke my title say's not his best but kudo's for the double side more artists should deliver there music in 5.1 suround sound.
2,"very,very average at best","for all the hype this Album is getting there isn't alot going on here that Bruce springsteen hasn't covered&done much better in the past.this album isn't on par with ""Nebraska"" or the tom Joad project. he is basiclaly doing his same rants about politics. He is alright for some acoustic moments but after a while it starts to bog things down. vocally He is about the same as He has ever been."
3,i got the wrong disc in the case...,"The craziest thing happened. I opened this disc up, popped it in, and somehow someone had stuck in a disc of old Steve Earle demos! Crazy!"
4,Better than most,At this point in Bruce's career - after giving his listeners thousands of hours of fantastic entertainment - Bruce can put out any type of album he wants!
3,"Some great songs, but Reno just beat out Real Man","What're ya thinking, Bruce?Real Man (from ""Human Touch"") was unfortunate 'cos of insipid melody and unfortunate lyrical content. That one was on the top of many lists. Bad lists, that is.We have a new list topper.Reno. Irrelevant and offensive. Most ""adult"" songs come from naive young performers that have no way of knowing better.Yes, you could be relevant and offensive. Then I may call it provocative.One song bespoils the punch bowl.Why 3 stars? There are some great songs on this CD. After making a Reno-less copy, though, the disc goes back on the shelf."
3,Not bad except for the Tiny Tim appearance,The album is starting to grow on me with every listen. The Tiny tim imitation though has to go.When I hear Bruce sing falsetto I can't help but think of Bruce in a dress and a wig singing - it's way too funny.I wonder if his kids are embarressed by the Reno song????I can't even play the Cd in front of my 3 year old.Overall the songs are very good and classic Bruce or what has Bruce has become are expected to produce.
3,Not his best...,"I am an avid fan of Springsteen but I think this may rank as one of his weakest albums. In my opinion, these songs are almost too similar to differentiate, it is hard to make out the lyrics and in my opinion the songs seem out of touch. Perhaps I just missed the point, or need to listen to it again, but to me it was well below the expectations I have of the Boss. With that said, his music still surpasses anyone else out there now, with the possible exception of J. Mellencamp. I hope he puts in a call to the E Street Band for his next project!"
1,Not singing but droning,This is a very dull and boring CD. He doesn't sing but just drones and mumbles. Its a long way down from his other albums. I have them all and like them all but this is awful.
1,Ripped off,"The content is fine, but won't run on my Dell computer. Therefore, can't be loaded to my MP3 player. Send enough complaints to Sony at 1-800-255-7514 so that they will cease this abuse of the public. Also, Bruce could stop this if he wished. He is supposed to represent the common man, which is us, not Sony."
1,I'm going to keep it simple.......,"A comparison of Springsteen's acoustic (or similar) albums:Nebraska-excellent, one of his bestGhost of Tom Joad-pretty boring, has a couple of good songsDevils & Dust-absolute drivel"
1,This album is just plain BAD,"I dont even care about how wacked out his politics are, there is not 1 good song on here. All you who try to find such deep meaning and read into every song like you know the heart and soul of Bruce crack me up. 99.99% of us have never met the man let alone know what makes him tick.Stay away from this, it is just bad...PS: Jeb 08!"
3,Bruces & Springsteen,"I heard he originally got his nickname ""the Boss,"" because of the damage he could do in the can. Kind of like, ""OH MAN - What is that SMELL - did somebody just DIE?!?"" ""The boss was just in there.""Anyhoo, this album rocks. It rocks hard. It rocks with conviction. Its straightforward, high-octane rock and roll. Bruce gets back to his roots on this baby. His rock roots.Spend the ""Dollars & Sense"" and pick up a copy of ""Devils $ Dust"" - just hope you never have to use the bathroom after ""The Boss"" has been in there."
2,Will not play on comuputer or I-pod,"RIP-OFF ALERT! This CD will not load on a PC hard-drive, no matter if it has the latest operating system. Thus, you will not be able to put the songs into I-tunes or play them on your I-pod. Some other reviewers report that it will not play on Mac either, though I have no experience with that. I do consider it unfair, indeed dishonest, to market the product without some sort of label warning consumers of this. The music earns a B+, the technology an F."
1,Buyer beware the DualDisc!,"Since I eagerly bought this album without reading the reviews (hey, who needs to read the reviews, it's the Boss!), I can only hope someone else sees this caution: great music, but BEWARE the dreaded DUALDISC. I cannot play it as a cd at all! I will try to get the European version, as another reviewer suggested, and guess I am out the money I spent on this annoying format (unless someone else wants to buy it!). Obviously, if you've tried DualDiscs and know you can play them--hey, get it & enjoy. But someone needs to let Bruce Springsteen and his label know that they've disappointed and frustrated a lot of fans with this release. Anyone know how to do that??!"
1,Buyer Beware,*from the back cover:The audio portion of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc.
1,Low Point for Springsteen,"I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down."
1,Advertised to fit my vehicle ... but sadly it didnt...,"As promised this product arrived quickly, It was described as fitting a Chevy Silverado, and advertised as fitting the same year GMC Sierra, which is why I bought it. I was unable to use it and when I tried to contact the company they were not helpful in getting me the proper product. Disapponted in this retailer."
5,Easy install!,"I can't believe how easy this was! I found a video on line that went through the process. After watching it a couple of times to make sure I understood every step I went to work. Had the door panel off in a flash, the old regulator out in nothing flat and the new one back in with no trouble. The toughest part was getting the plastic door liner to stay in place and popping the door panel back on - and that wasn't very tough, either!"
1,"Very good seller, Very Poor Quality Part","Very good seller, very poor quality part.First shipment was wrong part, and seller immediately responded via e-mail, shipped new part w/ in a few days. Very good customer service.Problem is, part--specifically the motor-- is just very low quality. Motor gets extremely hot after a just a few cycles, and is almost as slow as the original OEM regulator, which was dying. Motor gets hot just cycling a few cycles w/out being attached to the glass. This is not a problem w/ glass or track, nothing is binding, motor is just undersized or underpowered compared to the OEMs on the truck.I don't know if OEM replacement from Chevy is any better, but I'm going to have to find out."
1,bad replacement,"item was shipped and delivered on time, but item has only lasted a month now I have to replace it due to cables fraying and jamming window when rolling down."
5,Good Calculator for a Small Desks,"I don't have room for a large or medium size calculator on my desk. The numbers on the Sharp are large enough to read without glasses, it is about the size of a paper back fiction book which is great for small desk spaces."
4,Everything that's great about hard rock,"This album by TNT is a gathering of all that was great in hard rock before grunge came. This band has great melodies with a excellent guitar player and one of the best (and underrated)singers there is in rock.I encourage anyone who likes hard rock to buy this cd, as you will come to hear that it will become a favorite of yours, and you'll wonder where you were when this came out in '89!!!"
4,intuition,"record was sent immediately and in great shape.couldnt ask for much more.totally satisfied!thanx for the old school record.TNT has 10 albums but everyone trys to take u to the bank and your price was reasonable unlike alot of retailers who are greedy n try to make like they dont make their records anymore.some dont understand that if you have reasonable and good prices buyers will come back to you even if its a buck or two more.but if you charge unreasonable then they might buy once but never visit your site.let that be a lesson to one of the seven deadly sins GREED. take care,KB"
5,"Excellent, excellent book!","If you're a student of the Course, or not, but especially if you are, I believe this would be considered required reading for a lot of reasons that I won't go into here. But let me just say that this is as important a work as is ACIM. Because Ken had such a close and intimate relationship with Helen, he beautifully shares Helen with by using the Course and it's examples to tell her story.It's intense reading, so if you're looking for easy this isn't it. But it's gripping and enriching, so it's worth every second of it. Helen also wrote some incredible poetry in her later years and Ken highlights many of those in the same Course related fashion as well.You'll love yourself for reading this book!"
5,If you love the Course and only read one book about it.....,"This book gives A Course in Miracles much needed context, i.e. Helen and Bill's relationship, and makes large parts of it more easily understandable. The story of how the Course came about is a truly amazing one, and it's fascinating to read about the personal help given to Helen and Bill by Jesus, printed here, which didn't make it into the Course itself. This book really comes to life once the Course dictation starts, seeming a little laboured up to that point, but there are numerous treasures for every Course student from then on. Buy it, and then buy it for your friends too !"
3,Good topic but . . .,This is a great story. Too bad it is not written well. I found it to be slow going. The topic is fascinating to me and the writing is boring and heavy. I felt like I was wading through a beautiful river stuck in thick mud.
2,Great Expectations,"I found this book very dissapointing. However, it is the only source, as far as I know, of Helen Schuckman's Autobiography, pages of which are presented in the book. Unfortunately they are embedded in and surrounded by pages upon pages of explanation, which you may or may not find helpful.I found it anoying. Schuckman's words themselves are full of wonderful clarity. I'm sure the story of her life as she tells it is indeed an illuminating experience, you won't find much of it here. But perhaps what is here is worth plowing through the rest of the book and I should thank the author for giving us at least this much? If you're a Schuckman fan you will have to decide for yourself."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial. It looks like it would be a blast. Don't bother. It's just not fun. It's hard for kids to get the ice cubes in right & the little hammers are junk. With very little use, a couple of ours actually broke.I either put this away permanently or I threw it away. I can't remember which.This is junky garbage.Don't buy this."
4,very cute and entertaining,"This is easy enough to put back together, a consideration since the intent of the game is to break it apart. We have played it probably 50 times, each time building to the ""thrill"" of someone breaking the ice. Good for 3 year old with adults to put back together."
2,Tedious set up for short game time.,"Fitting in all of the blocks of ice for less than a minute of actual game time quickly becomes tiresome for the person putting it together. Also, if any of the blocks of 'ice' get lost the game would be useless. Not a good idea for a toy being used by a 3 year old. The kids thought pounding on the cubes was fun, especially when several blocks fell at once but I fail to see what educational value the toy has for the 5 and under set when all they want to do is see the bear fall through. This is one I'd like to hide on a high shelf."
3,Needs Parents Involvement,"The kids (2 & 4 years old) do enjoy playing the game, but they think it is really funny when the ice breaks, so they see who can make the bear fall the fastest. I timed them and it takes 15 - 20 seconds for them to break the ice. As a parent I get tired putting all the ice back in the frame."
5,Easy Fun Toy,"I bought this toy for my son and niece. They love it. They can put it together themselves and when the polar bear falls watch out because everyone laughs, even the one who made the polar bear fall. It teaches children how to take turns and to accept a loss if they actually do knock the polar bear down. I even play to get in on the fun."
2,Kids Tire Quickly,"This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.It's a classic and they're still excited to play when we bring it out, but they tire within two rounds, which only last about 30 seconds each. Left to their own, they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible, but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup, it's not really fun for anyone. There's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall, so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game. On our set, the plastic is poorly finished, so the bear doesn't stand/skate in the slot he's meant to. Perhaps it's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk. For now, PopUp Pirate is the family favorite. If you have other suggestions, please leave a comment."
4,Simple and Fun,"Do the games last all of five minutes? Yes. Is this game a pain to set up? Yes. Did my three year old understand that the goal is NOT to make the man fall? No. Do we all laugh and tell her she wins when she makes the man fall? Yes! This game is definitely not a set it and forget it game, parents have to at least be around to set it back up. But it's simple and the kids love it. These classics go for next to nothing around the holidays, so stock up then!"
4,good for turn taking,I use this game as a reinforcer during group speech therapy. It takes a little bit of time to set up but is fun and the kids can take turns popping out cubes of ice. Not my favorite game but the kids like it enough.
4,Great fun - play alone or together,"A cute, simple preschool toy that I like because I can play with my child or she can play with it alone. It can be challenging for the littler ones to learn how to set it up at first, but it'll come with practice. A nice, safe way to bang away."
5,don't break the ice,"Kids love it.....I love it too, this game has been around for a long time and continues to please the children"
5,Simple fun,"This toy is great fun to play, though a bit annoying to reset. Smaller children may need help in setting it up. My first grader can do it but it took her a few times to get how to pull the pieces and make them fit. We all enjoy the game."
4,Childhood memories,"This version is just like the one I had when I was a kid. My 5-year-old and I have a great time playing it. It was difficult for her to put the ice in -- at first. But, now she has the hang of it and does it all by herself. She still needs help inserting the skater. Good game for rainy day fun."
3,Don't Break the Ice,"I found this game to be somewhat fun, but not so durable. While putting the game together they got stuck and were unable to fix. We were still able to play but on an unstable board. But we did have a lot of fun and learned a lot in the long run. It helped with my younger brother's motor skills."
3,A little fun with a little help,"The kids love to bang away at the ""ice"" until the little guy falls through... about two times. Then the novelty wears off and they're ready to move onto something else. A fun classic for short term entertainment. Requires adult/older child to put ice together... too difficult for young children."
2,Not like it use to be,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson. The ""ice"" doesn't stay put when you turn it right side up. He gets really frustrated after spending all that time putting each ice cube in then they just fall out. Pretty disapointing."
1,More work than fun,"I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that aren't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us. My kids, ages 6 and 3, were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing. It's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids. Then, all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls. My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell. They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that's really only fun once or twice. I think we played it about four times in the past year. I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer, but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play."
4,Just like I remember,This game brings me back to when I was a little chap! It is perfect in every way and my kids love to play with it just like I did when I was their age.
3,Hagen Exo Terra Termite Hill,The idea behind the product is nice but it doesn't fit with the bottom of the rock. The crickets get out of the rock when you flip it over. Its a good idea just the product is flawed. Maybe if both side fitted perfectly it would have 5 star rating.
2,Classic Accessories ATV Cover,"It looked nice when I removed it from the box. A few problems...first, the lateral straps worked fine and had ample length to secure the cover. The strap that was supposed to stretch from front to back was too short by about 18 inches. Next, this ""trailerable"" cover did not survive the first trip at highway speeds. When I arrived on the other side, I found my brand new cover in tatters from the wind. I would not recommend this cover."
2,Dissapointment,"This is a good game and can be fun but it dissapoints in many aspects.Here are some-1-The voice acting sucks and only vaguely relate to what the characters say in the series.2-Multiplayer mode isn't that good because the attacks (like Heero's double beam cannon) aren't that spectacularP.S. I wish they made a game based on Gundam Wing and Endless Waltz because, in comparison to Gundam SEED, Gundam Wing although older and not as shiny has a much better storyline and much more game material than Seed. (plus the gundams look a'lot more flashy.(especially ZERO, EPYON, ans TALLGEESE 2."
1,Like a TV show,"Strictly for poker fans, this glorified TV movie has a big star cast, but what happened? It's deadly dull. The poker scenes are like watching paint dry. Long shots of cards on a table, while no one speaks. ZZzzz. How did Robert Duvall get mixed up in this thing? It's agonizing."
3,Poker Pro's,"The movie was saved by some FLEETING captures of my fellow Poker players!(Outside of Duvall, Berrymore shined brightest.)"
3,lucky you.....,An well acted movie with an okay script. The story line lacked umph enough for it to be a break out movie.It was a nice movie for entertainment purpose though. A little bit of language but nothing too bad! (that's probably why it didn't make it in hollywood!)A man obsessed with beating his father in poker is introduced to a woman who makes him THINK about the life he is living and how he is living it.
3,good poker movie,"Romance is barely present in this movie as poker takes over 80% of the movie. Aficionados of poker should enjoy this, as it present many aspects of playing the game.As for the romance, it's pathetically predictable.The acting is so-so, the directing is okay, there's nothing really worth mentioning.It's just a clean movie without any violence or guns.Enjoyable."
5,Pretty Good!,"Drew Barrymore is a delight to watch, she reminds me a little of her character in Never Been Kissed, the part where she was kindah popular. She wears sexy dresses in this and sings! (I didn't know Drew sings)And Eric Bana is so handsome! He's a bit of a sleezeball at first (lies and steals) but by the end, he's changed some. Eric Bana is also such a hunk! Someone should really put him in more projects we can watch, I mean I like he's acting work too--so subtle yet powerful.Drew should do more romantic comedies!"
1,"Oh Drew, what were you thinking?","If you enjoy watching people play poker, you might like this movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time. The characters and story are boring. I didn't care what happened to any of them, which turned out fine, since nothing really happened to any of them . . ."
4,"CURTIS HANSON, OPUS 12",***1/2 2007. Co-written and directed by Curtis Hanson. Eric Bana plays his father Robert Duvall in poker tournaments in Las Vegas. Good father/son relations movie.
2,Below average...,"It was an OK movie. I am a poker fan, so it was cool to see alot of the big names get cameo appearances..."
3,"Lucky you, Lucky me",Nice film to watch on dvd.... I would say it is the middle of the road average in terms of movies out there on the market today.The acting and storyline are good and very solid throughout... Eric Bana's character is a professional poker player in Las Vegas struggling with some issues like a difficult time making a commitment in the romantic department. His character also has issues with his professional poker playing father who placed poker far and above his family. These issues seem to be resolved by the end of the movie in an understated kind of way.
2,Weirdly somnolent,"High stakes Las Vegas gambling and Drew Barrymore- what could be more exciting? Right? Wrong. Drew sleepwalks through this movie in a trance (hopefully not chemically induced), there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Bana (how could there be chemistry between two rocks?), and the tone of this movie and its actors is so low-key that it quickly descends into a monotone drone. With its relative dearth of music and surprisingly fuzzy film quality, I would have thought that I was watching a low-budget Bulgarian movie from the 1980s, were it not for the familiar faces and American details. It's not a disaster, but it's not very good either. Unless you're a big time fan of professional poker, skip it."
2,This movie was so boring!!!,"This movie is about a poker player that has had a strained relationship with his father who meets a girl. And that's about it. There is no depth or chemistry between the couple, you certainly don't root for them to be together. The father and son do repair their strained relationship at the end of the movie.There are several poker matches shown so if you like poker, you might like this movie otherwise you probably won't."
2,Rounders Wannabee?,"Drew Barrymore was too cute and innocent, but not bad. Eric Bana playing the obsessed poker-playing pro was boring and somewhat of a veiled ripoff of Matt Damon's excellent character in the superior movie ""Rounders.""Even though you get to see some ""Real World poker players"" such as Phil Helmut, Daniel Negreanu, Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson,"" it didn't help the awful plot of pitting father (Robert Duvall) against son (Eric Bana)."
2,bleh,I wanted a deoderant without any harsh chemicals... so i opted to go with this. The only problem is it does NOT WORK at all.
5,"Herbal Clear: Clear Aloe Fresh Natural Deodorant, 2.65 oz by Wes",This product is the best Deodorant I have ever used. I have used it for the past 5 years and it has caused no rash under my arms like other deodorants I have used that contain toxic chemicals to the body
3,It's ok but I don't prefer it,"I bought this because I wanted to find a non anti perspirant deodorant (it doesn't seem like a good idea to add these chemicals to your body every single day). I have used both the aloe and the lavender. Both of the scents didn't really impress me. They worked well enough (I didn't have BO), but I found Degree Women's Nature Effects Solid Deodorant Stick-Honeysuckle-2.2 oz (Pack of 5) which is a mainstream deodorant without anti-perspirant. I think it's pretty ridiculous that there are about 100 different anti perspirants available for women, but hardly any deodorants without anti perspirants. Hopefully in the future the market will grow for this type of item."
1,this SUCKS,yes of course this works very well and i like that its gel but it says its all natural and stuff....the like 3rd of something ingredient has sum icky ingredient.....i wouldnt buy it again!
5,Excellent for sensitive or allergic skin,"Recently, my skin developed a rash when appying deodorants with aluminum (basically all the standard ones). I tried this deodorant and it works very well. As an active male, I sweat a lot but this product gives me more than 12 hours of protection against body odors and my skin is now perfect."
2,"12 hours, TOPS.","I put a ton of this on at about 8 pm right after a shower. It smelled nice and didn't irritate my pits, which is good. However, by 10 am the next morning I had a nice funk going on and I'm not a particularly smelly person, nor did I do anything strenuous that night, if you know what I mean. I can see detecting a slight, ""Oh I better reapply"" kinda smell the next morning but it was full on ""I need to shower"" b.o. I went ahead and reapplied because I wasn't quite ready for a shower and an hour or two later I was smelling again. Needless to say, didn't work for me. I'm 28, maybe I'm still too hormonal, who knows."
5,Herbal Clear Deoderant,"I absolutely LOVE this product, but find it hard to find. I found it on Amazon, and am VERY PLEASED. Was shipped right away, and I felt that the prices was great. Awesome value. THANK YOU!!"
1,1 cent,"Let's just say there's a reason this book goes for only one cent in the used book portion of this site. Here's my ""2sense"": save the penny."
5,hard to find but worth it,Love the music on this CD took me literally years to find. Highly recomend though only after you brush up on your japanese or look up the lyric translations for the songs.
3,The night the Fitz went down,"Overall, the book was not too bad. I do nearly agree with the theory presented regarding the reason the ship sank, as it is certainley more believable than the Coast Guard's reasoning. The one thing I did not care for is the ""arrogance"" I felt was displayed by Capt. Parquette. Although I did not mind reading about his experiences, he talked (wrote?) like he was all knowing, and could never do wrong. I sailed on the Great Lakes for a bit as an engineer, and I still get up there once a year to do work in March, so I have met some Captains here and there, and most seem pretty reasonable. However, I do not think much of this guy. Nonetheless, a good book regarding the ship itself, and it does present some interesting facts. So, in closing, I would recommend it if you are into the history of this ship, and would like to know as I why it went down."
3,A Captain with a ego so large no lake boat could carry!!!,"I have read this book and found it very informative. The book is mostly about a ego driven Captain who has never made a mistake. Once you get to page 80 or so, the book is very well written and actually talks about the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Up until this part of the book the Captain tell endless storys about how great he was as a Captain. He does have great evidence on what happened to the Edmund Fitzgerald."
2,Everything but,I was disappointed that the reader has to wade through many chapters that had little to do with the Edmund Fitzgerald. Instead the book had great detail on Capt. Paquette's experiences and other ships on the Great Lakes. There are many other books which expound on the Fitzgerald much better. In addition the type style/size is difficult and eye straining to read. The book Gales of November is much better.
4,when you're right ...,"I understand the immediate response to the read mentioned. In some ways, I agree. The good captain is a bit arrogant, but I found it refreshing and forthright. His style is to the point. Did anyone else notice the photos of the good captain in uniform? In that line of work, such professionalism was rare. here's a man who took pride in his job, did it well, and if he were in command of the Fitz that night, I doubt we'd be having this debate. Arrogance is good, pride is good, because when you're right, you're right. This man mastered his chosen profession. How many people can say that?"
5,May be his best cd.,"There are one or two good songs on each Otis Clay's cd - on his Hi albums, his live albums, or his cds for Bullseye -, but this one is mighty good from the first to the last song.Recorded in 1989, this album shows Otis Clay teaming up again with Hi producer Willie Mitchell - the man behind Al Green or O.V Wright best records. But instead of looking back into the 70's, the team goes further into the modern southern soul. And so, with Otis at his top, great producing, powerful bass guitar, and some funny lyrics, they do even better than 20 years earlier, especially with songs like ""Two wrongs"", ""Soap opera blues"", ""I know I'm over you"", ""You are my life"" or ""Nobody's on the phone""IF YOU ALREADY KNOW AND LIKE OTIS CLAY, THIS CD IS A MUST ; IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIM, CHECK UPON THIS CD."
2,Very disappointed!,"We purchased this clock expressly for our motor home travels. The criteria was to have a clock that is small, can be read in the dark, has numbers large enough to see without aid of glasses, and, most importantly, has a battery back up that will return to the correct time after an extended period without shore power. We have tested the clock at home and found it does not return to the correct time. In fact, it is at least 20 minutes fast each time we plug it in after an extended time without power. So we are very disappointed in this purchase."
5,we want lyle on vhs,"The Lyle story has given us much to sing about...from the local library. We want to have Lyle in our ome as well, as I am sure any youngster (and any adult who appreciates a good musical!) will also! Please bring back Lyle's adventure on East 88th St. back to VHS!"
2,if you try to please everyone...,"What should have been a no-brainer return to form after her tepid foray into singer/songwriter territory on The Girl In The Other Room, Diana Krall's new album of tried-and-true jazz standards backed by a big band never really gets off the ground. While her previous collaboration with the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, Christmas Songs, was a charmer, From This Moment On has too much polish and not enough sparkle and swing, and the tunes just kind of sit there. If you try to please everyone..."
2,phoning it in,"I'm a jazz fan. I like Diana Krall - the jazz pianist who can sing. I have a few of her earlier cds (""Stepping Out"", ""All For You"") when she was playing the piano more. I sort of ""checked out"" of her later 'big hits' and then most definitely got back in synch with her ""The Girl In The Other Room"" project - somewhat of a collaboration with her husband (and one of my personal favorites) Elvis Costello. So when ""This Moment On"" came out, I was looking forward to more of the personal feel of ""The Girl..."" - but no. Not even close. It sounds like Diana was just fulfilling her contractual requirements with her record company on this one. Feels like she just phoned it in."
4,From this moment on,It's good to see Diana recovering from the dark recording she did with her husband.
4,Bodene's Review,"Diana accomplishes a great task of expanding her range both in depth and in maturity to attain a very pleasurable experience in ""This moment On"" of modern Jazz - Voice."
5,her best yet,"it has been amazing to listen to diana krall mature as an artist. on ""From This Moment On"" she really showcases her amazing ability to take a standard and make it her own. Those who love her earlier efforts and were disappointed a bit by the original songs on ""The Girl In The Other Room"" will be psyched to hear her return. truly an amazing effort and likely to be a classic for the ages!! a million stars"
2,Diana Crawls from this moment on,"To establish my credentials as a long-time Diana Krall fan, My wife and I bought airline tickets and hotel room to see her in Washington, D.C. I have all her CDS, and have seen her live twice. Her last three outings - Room, Christmas, and this CD have been huge disappointments. Diana seems to lack the sparkle she had as Trio and Live in Paris. The band revs up, but she doesn't come along. She is bending her notes like a bad carnival ride at most every turn. Her range is compressed. All in all, a very dissapointing CD with few thrills and a lot of mediocrity. My earlier reviews had compared DK with Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn. I see now those comparisions were grossly premature and I wish to apologize to these late greats. I truely hope Diana finds her form again, but it all seems down hill from after Live in Paris. I wish her well with her new family and miss her earlier outstanding output."
3,Not quite what I had hoped for,"I'm with the reviewers who have expressed a longing for Diana's smaller band days. Only Trust Your Heart and Love Scenes are my favorites, as well as Live From Paris. Even on When I Look In Your Eyes, in the midst of all of those orchestral arrangements, there was still a sense of soulfulness to her songs. The Big Band sound on this CD really undercut what I love most about Diana's voice-- the sultry intimacy of it.I pre-ordered this CD because Diana's name alone is good enough for me to invest in her projects, but this one felt stunningly empty, like a shell without a core. But I understand that artists must try any and all things to grow. Some things will resonate with a lot a people, while others won't. It's all a matter of personal taste. I will continue to buy Diana's music, but this one was lukewarm for me."
2,I think this will be it...,"I doubt I will be buying another Diana Krall album anytime soon. Though I really love her older records such as All for You, Live in Paris, the past few albums have left me cold. This one sounds just too contrived and commercial. I would just love to hear her with her trio again, but I wonder if that will ever happen."
2,Get back to the Trio,"I was disappointed with this CD. I feel that Diana Krall is not compatable with a large orchestra, and that she exceeds her vocal range with missed pitch and odd manerisms in expressing the lyrics. I feel that she is at her best with a small combo and her piano. It is the intimate Diana Krall that I long for. Will she come back??Warren Schrick"
2,Zzzzzzzz,"A `Great American Songbook' sojourner for years, but signifying just exactly what? Tedium? By choosing predominantly 'happy' songs, Krall treads dangerous ground by eschewing her forte - usually slow-paced dirges, sung in a husky monotone. By juicing up the ante, she could bear responsibility for a backlash. But her fan base need not worry. While she's discovered reasons to be joyful these past few years [e.g. marriage to Elvis Costello, pregnancy] Krall couldn't sound more blasé; while her piano skills remain plucky and skillful, her gloomy phrasing continues to mope until her droopy delivery cures your aching insomnia. My grade: B- [although it should be Zzzzzzzzz]."
2,just ok,"Diana Krall has always been a Artist that I respected Her talent,but I never quite got the full buzz over,but over her past two albums I'm really lost now,because Her voice doesn't work well in a bigger band enviroment. She is better suited in a smaller unit that allows her instrument of voice to be heard&given that feel she is known for doing in her material. there is way too much going on in the overall sounds&they don't blend with her vocally enough. She doesn't have enough in her Chops to keep up with what she is trying to pull off here. I applaud the effort,but she has to get back to what best compliments her stylings."
4,Nice.,Good cd. It just had a scratch on it when I got it so I don't listen to it very often.Pamela in Arkansas
3,What went on with Ms. Krall?,"Repertoire consists of rather expected standards. All broadly covered brilliantly by so many vocalists in the past. Ms. Krall and her arrangers adds nothing at all.Singing offers no surprise than a mainstream singer would do.Orchestra is currently the darling big band of the time being. Good players, rare good ideas, nothing impelling.There is an original and beautiful arrangement here: for the track 'How Insensitive'.And that's all. Let's wait for the next Krall album."
4,Not her best,"In my opinion, a so-so effort. Well produced, but I don't think the material. or arrangements, are particulary well suited to Diana's strengths."
5,Great as always!,"Diana Krall is simply the best contemporary singer to interpret this collection of great standards. From her throaty, torchy renditions to her supurb piano playing she represents a much welcome return to the way it should have always be done.It is getting difficult to find good jazz in the classic mode. For the purists, this is your disc."
3,"Good voice, nothing special in music",It's quite plain vocal jazz. Instruments are so-so for there's no big parts for them. I'd consider this as nice background music.
4,Diana Krall a bit off lately,"I loved every one of Diana Krall's releases until ""The Girl in the Other Room."" It was a departure from her usual kind of songs, and though I tried to like it, I could not. ""From This Moment On"" is far better, in my opinion, but I still don't think it comes up to the standard set by her earlier releases. See if you agree, but to me it seems to feature her piano playing much less. That was a big disappointment to me. She is a great singer, but I like to hear her play too. I really missed that on this CD."
5,Diana Krall Hits Another Home Run,"Diana Krall is for real. Not just another pretty face. This is one talented woman. This album is awesome in 2 ways...First an excellent quality recording for us audiophiles mastered by the MASTER himself Doug Sax...Signature Doug Sax...smooth, perfectly balanced in every way. Second a wonderful performance with again John Clayton doing magic with that standup bass...This guy is the greatest bass player since James Jamerson. Diana sounds smooth and her delivery is never overblown and overdone. The piano playing is spot on and things really come together nicely . First class CD and thank you Diana for the music."
2,Sorry,I own all the CD'd that Diana Krall has made. Sorry to say that her last 2 have not been her best. Love it when she records with just a very small 'back-up' group. This way she Shines at her best. Good luck Diana in the future.Jean H.
3,Krall down to a Krall,"I'm a former professional jazz musician and really appreciate what Diana did in her early years -- her best albums for me are ""All for You"" and ""Live in Paris."" To my ears, the energy is not there anymore -- I think that killer non-stop touring for all those years has used up a lot of energy. The pressure's off now -- she's married and has children on the way -- that's going to have its effect. She's just not ""into it"" as we used to say. Anyhow... great talent and has given us some of the best jazz performances I've heard in my time as a jazz player and listener."
1,disappointing,"I consider myself a Diana Krall fan...and I'm a huge Elvis Costello fan - somehow I was hoping that this union would produce some incredible music...a merging of their styles...maybe some terrific covers... I don't know - something exciting, fun, inspired. Instead I must say I find this cd pretty boring - where was Elvis? Who picked the song selection? I was hoping for so much more!"
2,Weak effort - sadly...,"I have all Krall's recordings - my favorites being ""Love Scenes, the Look of Love,"" and the album which preceeded this one (the title eludes me at the moment)- but this album is sad. The vocals aren't up to par and the songs chosen have trite lyrics. The musicianship isn't bad - but there is a formulatic approach that leaves the songs cold and uninspired. There is no life in this album. A dud... Disappointing - I was excited to here more Krall. Shamefully, I couldn't even find one song (save maybe ""how insensitive"") that I really liked..."
3,Disappointing,"Maybe I just can't get into the ""big"" Diana Krall sound. When she was playing with her trio on her early albums, I absolutely loved her. Now, with all the horns and strings...not so much. Or maybe I'm just subconciously mad at her for marrying Elvis Costello instead of me. And having his twins instead of mine. In any case...Stepping Out and her tribute to Nat ""King"" Cole remain my favorite albums of hers. Ms. Krall: Less = More."
5,D. Fowler,"Thankfully, Diana has returned to what she does best and that is ""the standards."" This album is wonderful! To me, it's another testament to her distinct sound as a jazz singer. I hope she never ventures into the pop field......... she does jazz and standards so well."
4,Diana is back,"After a brief excursion (in The Girl in the Other Room) away from the American songbook which she does so well, Diana Krall has recorded another winner. Great, smooth vocals, backed with combo sounds that have been her trademark."
1,Used to Love Diana Krall,"Her new CD is not representative of her previous ones. She tries to swing by using a word and changing notes on it. It doesn't work. She should go back to her old ""jazz"" singing."
4,Well Done Diana,If you like brass and jazz..if you like Ella and Louie and the Count...this will soon be a favorite. She plays off the horns (listen to the tension playing behind her in how insensitive) she holds her own and takes it her way. Can't stop playing it!
5,Amazing,How could you compare this awesome band to a band like Trivium? Trivium blows. The guitar solos in this album are so much more amazing than anything Trivium has ever done.
5,Basing this off live performance,"I just saw Silent Civilian at the Ill Nino/God Forbid show. And while I was mostly there for God Forbid, once I heard Santos had a new band I got excited. This band sounded AMAZING live. The energy in the place could be felt all over. All in all, buy this album based off the live performance alone."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I don't understand why this album is so well-liked. I bought it after seeing it on a ""Top 50 Reggae Albums"" list in Relix magazine. It really is disappointing. It's the same old Studio One riddims that have been used over and over again, which in some cases have been brought alive (for example, on Michigan & Smiley's ""Rub-a-Dub Style"" and ""Sugar Daddy"" albums). But here, the combination of these overused tracks and Williams' boring vocals make for a seriously boring album."
2,not great,too large a head for all but the largest dogs...just puts out ions fr small hole....[poorly designed on/off button that easily gets turned off while using and also turned on when not....have accidently used up several 9v batteries when somethig touched it in the drawer and turned it on...........would buy one of the other models if had it to do over.
3,"solid, professional and really good","This is one of those records that is tough to rate on a scale of 1-5 stars. It's not as good a project as One of the Fortunate Few, Never Been Rocked Enough or Nothing Personal. So you can't give it four or five stars, but it's better than three stars which seems to be an journeyman perfomance.Perhaps the most valuable service Delbert provides to us (other than making some of the best music available) is showing how fine the line is between r&B; and country.Unfortunately as a result he only gets played when he shows up on IMUS in the Morning.Definately one to own-but make sure you have ""Fortunate Few"" and ""Never Been Rocked Enough"" too."
3,Huh?,"The previous review was correct about a Grammy (at least nominee), but the category of the award for ""contemporary blues"" has me baffled. This definitely is more like country than blues. Has the definition of the blues changed?I've heard better, and I hope Etta James wins the Grammy for this category -- she deserves it for ""Burnin' Down the House."""
1,Neuro waste of time,"THis video should not even be on amazon, its a waste of time, the guy hardly knows what he is talking about, he is only speaking to 3 people and has no structure. If you are looking for NLP this is NOT IT, stay away"
3,la regadera,It is a sort of song in which one mixes in metaphor form the sex subjects taboos at that time with an impeccable game of language
2,"Nothing Special, It's Suppose to be FREE!","I ordered and am now returning this set if utensils. My wife has a set of Analon Professional cookware, so I thought these would be a nice accessory. When the box arrived, it says FREE with any purchase of Analon over $150, so it looks really cheesy as a gift. The tools themselves look to be low quality and are rather small. After receiving this set, I did a more thorough search for Ananlon utensils and found their ""Sure Grip"" line at Linens N Things. They are $10 per piece, so about double the price, but at least triple the quality. I think she'll love the new ones!"
1,Better Deal Available Elsewhere,"#1 This is supposed to be free with $150 purchase#2 I went to Walmart, bought Farberware (also made by Meyer ... like Analon) ... the nicer utinsels were $2.82 each and NICE and the ok (not as nice but still quality) were about $1.80 each.I've seen Calphalon, Analon, KitchenAid, etc. ... don't waste your time or money ... go see for yourself and buy Farberware (they also had some decent, like for extra's, utinsels for $.50 each to expand you selection of tools).And I have Anolon Professional Cookware Set, and a variety of other Calphalon, and other high quality cookware."
1,save your money,"i was really shocked to get my utensils. couldn't believe these were intended as a free promotional gift and i paid $30.00 for them. wished i read the other reviews i never would have ordered them. now i have to take the time and send them back, i'm not happy at all."
2,ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL TO SELL A 'FREE GIFT W/ PURCHASE'?,"How lame for Amazon.com to sell a free gift that one would get if you bought a set of Anolon cookware. I was so excited to get these utensils to give as a gift to my mother in law, but when I recieved it, the box had, in HUGE LETTERS, the following: ""OUR GIFT TO YOU with a purchase of $150 or more in Anolong Classic or Anolon Professional cookware"". I think it is a cheap shot for Amazon to sell this. I feel like I just was at a swap meet! I wonder if it is illegal to sell something that wasn't intended for individual sale? I paid 9.99 for these and if I had paid one penny more, I would have filed a complaint with somebody involved with Amazon and interstate commerce! The utensils are flimsy at best and I am embarrassed to give them to my mother in law!"
5,Solomon's Touch Touched My Heart...,"What an absolutely inspiring book. Solomon's Touch touched my heart. For one with or without medical problems,this book is a must read. I look forward to one day meeting Solomon or one of his trained ""disciples"". He is blessed with the gift of healing and shares his gift without expecting anything in return. What a delight in this materialistic day and age."
5,Solomon's Touch,This book was fabulous. I would recommend it to anyone to read. Very interesting ready.
1,It's too good to be true,"I purchased the pet boundary indoor barrier system as a gift for my parents to help control their dogs. The system requires a tag to be worn and it only comes with one tag, which isn't desirable for multiple dog households. Their weenie dog loves to grab the main unit and play with it as if it were one of his toys. He is completely unaffected by it. It was a total waste of money. This product does not work so please don't waste your money on it."
1,Doesn't Work,"My timid cat walked up to it, looked surprised, then sat down next to it and groomed herself. I e-mailed Lentek to see if I was doing something wrong and got NO RESPONSE. I called and got a rather lazy-sounding guy who knew nothing and seemed to think his job was to get me off the phone as quickly as possible. Some customer service! I'll never buy Lentek anything again."
1,Worthless,"I purchased two of these units. First of all, the range between the transmitter and receiver is more like ten inches; not six to ten feet as advertised. And, our dog walked back and forth right next to the unit with no response. She finally trained herself to stay out of the room being ""protected"".I wrote and phoned Lentek with no return contact from them. I have purchased their products before, but this will be the last time."
3,Larger radius than described,"I got this product hoping to train my dog to stay downstairs and out of the bedroom when we are not home as he had been urinating on the corner of the bed :( Unfortunately the signal radius was more like 15-20ft (maybe more) instead of 6-10 and it was able to go through walls and floors so that my poor dog sat nervously in the back corner of the house downstairs while the base unit was upstairs in the front of the house and placed above the window sill (as far as the cord could reach from the outlet). We live in a townhouse and it was sadly just a little too large a barrier for our needs. Had we had a bigger house it probably would have been fine. Would not recommend for people in apartments or small houses, although we may try affixing the base unit to the ceiling upstairs and see if that's far enough away to let my dog rome downstairs. The only downfall to that is we would either need to keep batteries in it or run an extension cord to the nearest outlet."
1,Sonic Pet Boundary,"This will be very short, either both units were defective or these area very poor design. Both my cats would lay in front of them, I couldnot see any reaction from any of my cats. I returned them promptly andI'm not using the scat mat with some success."
3,Lentek PB01C,Good item but collar part not tough enough. Now broken and no battery. Lasted a few weeks.
2,useless,"I had one of these things for a while. I loved it. Now they ""improved"" it. They made it more sensitive. What a nightmare! It used to have a 6'-10' range, now it sences eveything with in a 30' range. I was using it to keep one of my cats out of a corner that she liked to pee in. If I set up the new one, she can't even walk through the room.They should have put a control on this to adjust the distance that it picks up the collar's signal.I really wish the old one had not broken. :("
5,Blues Band? Who cares! It's great music!,"As per usual, Repertoire's mastering job is great. The music is is diverse - ranging from straight-out blues to the pop smash, COULDN'T GET IT RIGHT. STILL, all of this music sounds at home on the same disc. If you want a single disc compilation of tight, bluesy, British rock, LOOK NO FURTHER. Snap this up."
3,Couldn't Get Right --Climax Blues Band,This is not the Climax Blues Band I remember.? All the tracks here are remastered or reworked in some way & in doing so have been altered from the original. The only song here that sounds good is Couldn't Get it Right. The cuts from a Lot of Bottle & Tightly Knit are badly redone.If you want to hear the real CBB get the original CDs A Lot of Bottle or Tightly Knit.
4,Huh?,"Can anybody explain these previous reviews. Anyway a good album, except missing 'together and free', 'using the power' and the version of 'reaching out' is horrendous compared to the album release."
4,"Lewd, Rewd, and Crew'd","A great natural cast having a ball playing the types of characters we all secretly like to snicker at (behind their backs, of course).Wait for Dan Haber in the final reel to knock you off your A$$ with laughs as he plays (by far) the craziest dude you've ever seen on screen.See it with friends."
3,TO MONSTER OR NOT TO MONSTER. THAT IS THE QUESTION,"As movies go, this one is good with the expected reliable sophistication of a quality Hammer film, but for me it just wasn't Frankenstein Monstery enough."
4,A Hammer Classic,"If you're a fan of Hammer films then this is an excellent one - especially of the Frankenstein and Dracula series. I've been a fan of these movies since I first saw them as a teen. I remember being enthralled by them and so I have wanted to collect them. Looking at them now as an adult, they do seem somewhat quaint, cliched and the plots are sparse and full of holes, but Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee will always be my favorite Dr. Frankenstein, Van helsing & Dracula(among other roles) and are still a joy to watch(especially with my kids who get to see the gothic fright and get to avoid the modern gore). Revenge Of Frankenstein is one of the best made and plotted of the series and a excellent one to get from the Hammer Films era."
5,Dr. Stein,"We pick up at the end of The Curse of Frankenstein where Dr. Frankenstein had been sentenced to death and is being led to the guillotine. He escapes with the aid of a cripple, Carl, which he has promise a new body for helping him escape. Later a Dr. Stein has opened a clinic where he treats the poor. He continues his experiments in a secret lab where he has assembled a body for Carl.As Dr. Stein practice flourishes, the local medical council is offended that he will not join their ""group."" The council visits Dr. Stein and tries to persuade him to join but he refuses. One of the council members Hans recognizes him at Dr. Frankenstein and decides to assist him. Dr. Stein and Hans give Carl a new body but when his brain becomes damage in a brawl, he turns into a cannibalistic monster.We have another wonderful performance by Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein/Stein.The transfer to DVD is excellent."
1,"It arrived in bad condtion, damaged","This is another movie that arrived damaged, unfortunately. I did return it, received the refund, but would like to have it again, but it seems that all the copies are damaged. Please, if you want to sell it to me again, make sure that it is working first, you can open it up, test it out in your dvd, or computer and then, after you do this, you can send it to me. Please write me and let me know.Thank you,Jacqueline"
5,golden age hammer,"Superb film from Hammer.Peter Cushing is, as usual on top form as the notorious baron.The transfer looks amazing with the old,vibrant colours really glowing.If you want to see Hammer at their very best this is one that shows exactly why no one else could touch them.Brilliant."
4,One of Hammer's often overlooked classics,"When thinking about Hammer Films' cheap gore & nudity films of the 1970's, it is often difficult to remember the day when they could produce something as perfect as this! The original sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein"" is a beautifully mounted, directed and acted minor masterpiece of the horror film. Jimmy Sangster's thoughtful and restrained screenplay illustrates the reason why he was Hammer's best screenwriter, rivalled only by Terence Fisher's masterful direction. Good old Peter Cushing is back, as a slightly more mellow, humane Baron Frankenstein. Cushing is a joy to watch and listen to as he smoothly maneuvers his way through and insinuates himself into the politics and society of an elegant Swiss burg in the 1860's. The only thing missing is a James Bernard score! If you like your horror films with a dose of 'realism' and good old fashioned drama over just plain screams and action, then this is for you!"
3,The revenge of Hammer productions,"In this addition to the series Dr. Victor Fankenstein (Peter Cushing) escapes hanging and is soon back to his old tricks. While walking through a graveyard the supposedly deceased Frankenstein comes across a grave robber and greets him ""Good evening, I am Frankenstein"" resulting in the robber having a heart attack and falling into the open grave!Frankenstein soon gets back to practising medicine under the alias Dr. Stein; but a medical student soon discovers his true identity and threatens to expose Frankenstein unless he takes him on as his protege. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees and the pair soon embark on their first experiment- transplanting the brain of a partially paralysed man into a healthy new corpse (that doesn't sound right). Peter Cushing is good, the production atmospheric and the script above average. Not a classic, but recommended to horror fans nevertheless."
1,I wouldn't buy it!,"It has a samsung logo, but it looks fake after I bought it. The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason."
5,Good Geek Book,"Although slightly dated, this book is an excellent resource for wireless communcations with Linux. It also covers a lot of information about wireless computer communications in general. Want to build your own access point? The info is in this book! There are lots of ideas to build from in here!"
2,Melodrama,"The first hour had me wondering if I'd even finish the movie. When the girl's mother appears about an hour or so into it and tells him to get out of the way, interest picks up (a bit). At least, we only have to suffer through one more groping the air and flailing around ""passion"" scene. Ha! Actually, I like Jeremy Irons as an actor, and could appreciate some of the moments he brings to the movie (minus the sex scenes), but not enough to suggest buying this movie - or even watching it!If you make it halfway through, you'll probably stick it out until the end. It piques the curiousity by the time it climaxes. But even after everything starts tumbling down, there's always that feeling of bad eighties cheese in it (actually it's from 1992). My gut instinct is that this movie is pretty lame; it makes you wonder about the places passion can (or could) take you and the movie tries to be art, but mostly it's melodrama."
2,He Reminds Me of the Fonz,"An endless panalopy of soft-core fornication embodied in a plot that is somewhat muddled. That is, the motivation of the young female protagonist is murky at best. And since the entire story is contingent on really understanding this woman's motivation, the outcome to a viewer is unsatisfying. And why does the male protagonist keep physically reminding me of Henry Winkler (aka ""The Fonz"")"
4,This is a well-done movie about a man who cannot control himself,"This is a well-done movie about a man who cannot control himself, has an affair with a young woman even though he knows she is his son's fiancé, and it ruins him and his family totally. Irons is good, although I find that he seems to play every part the same way (as does Ralph Fiennes and Jon Malovich in their films...). Binoche is great, and hot, and overall the cast does a great job. The story is believable, and compelling, even though the viewer knows full well that the relationship between Irons character and that of Binoche is heading for a train wreck. The largest fault in the film is that we don't really get much answer to why Binoche's character wants to sleep with Irons and yet she still wants to marry his son. That is not really explained. Also-the brief scene at the end where Miranda Richardson shows her boobs is totally inappropriate."
4,"Moody, quiet, and dangerous","After I finished watching this film, I realized that there wasn't much dialog, character development, or conflict. Rather it is a mood piece, with carefully chosen shots, music, and expressions that relay a situation to the viewer more effectively than standard film devices. It wasn't boring at all, and felt like watching the private space of a handful of people. Very European in feel, but standard enough to keep the interest of those who generally don't like that sort of thing."
3,"Strange movie, very dramatic","I love Jeremy Irons, but this movie was different than I thought it would be. A little too dark for my taste. But still it was well acted."
3,a damaged film,"I like Jeremy Irons, but I was pretty disappointed in this film.I think that Binoche comes off as somewhat wooden, and the sex scenes are comedic. They look like a couple of marionette puppets going at it. I don't need to go into detail with the storyline; others have done that.I give it 3 stars because it's okay, I suppose. This is the sort of film that you may consider renting, or better yet, wait for it to air on TV someplace. I took the chance buying it because it was on a good sale.A lot of people seem to want to over-analyze and interpret the meta-messages, etc., and tell you what it REALLY means, lol. But at the end of the day, it's not that great of a film overall."
3,.,"An interesting but overrated film. I thought Irons did a fine job. The story is interesting, although the motives and emotions that are driving the two main characters are left in an ambiguous haze. Binoche bugged me, though; I suppose her character and her performance are meant to be evocative and mysterious, but I just found her dull and irritating. The sex scenes struck me as highly pretentious, and the very end of the movie is inexplicably silly. It's not that the movie doesn't have anything going for it -- it does. But there are qualms to be had at the same time."
3,Everyone has that Someone That Just Turns them On!,"There isn't any depth to this movie. It is simply a movie about obcession. Some people have physical attractions others are just attracted to quirky or evil individuals. This is basically a film about a man that is obcessed with a woman that is mysterious and very sick. He is obcessed with the mystery and the nonchalant character of this woman. Also she has a very sick deep dark distrurbing past that turns him on. Everyone has Morbid attraction to someone. I have and I am pretty sure you have as well. If you have been so obcessed with someone that everytime you look at them you want to ravish them? This is the film for you. If you have been so obcessed with someone so much that you sniff there cloths this one is for you. If you have a fetish for sick or weird individuals then this is the film for you. Jeremey Irons has a knack for potraying unlikeable, and being perverse characters check for ""Lolita""!"
1,i want my money back,"I want my money back. Not from Amazon, but from Jeremey Irons for a stunningly bad performance and from Roger Ebert for giving this movie four stars. HE'S LYING. Jeremey Irons has an affair with his son's fiance'. Hmmmmm. Something new. An idea with possibilities. But it ends there folks. No attempt is made to explain why these two are attracted to one another, they just are. They are driven enough to sacrifice themselves and those they supposedly care about. The movie makes no attempt to make us care about their in-law incestuous relationship or their respective families. Where is that Mac truck when you need it. One final comment-""Dead Ringers"""
3,Everyone has that Someone That Just Turns them On!,"There isn't any depth to this movie. It is simply a movie about obcession.

4,"HOT, HOT, HOT!","Hot, steaming erotic and intelligent psychologically intense film about a British politician who gets into a searing love affair with his son's fiancee. Pop it in, be prepared to be rocked, and get ready to take a cold shower afterwards!"
1,A Huge Disappointment from Irons and Malle,"After hearing about this film for many years, I finally saw it this evening. It was a major disappointment, from the lack of subtlety (did Malle tell Irons and Binoche to look at one another on first glance as if they were starving island-dwellers who have stumbled upon a buffet supper?), to the energetic but clumsily-choreographed sex scenes, to the constant little ""uh-ohs"" that permeated the film (does Irons' secretary suspect? does the hotel clerk? does his son?), to poor Miranda Richardson's utterly gratuitous topless scene... The dialogue rarely rang true, characters would conveniently be given the space to suddenly go off on a ""revealing"" monologue, and the background music was yet another New Age-y, echo-chambered piece of froth. I'll happily remember Malle from such films as ""Elevator to the Gallows"", ""Au Revoir les Enfants"" and ""Atlantic City""...but ""Damage"", I'll try to forget."
2,"bad movies are dangerous, they just go on & on & on","how strong an impression did this movie make on me? having watched it 2 or 3 weeks back, i had to just now go look it up on imdb to recollect who was in it or what it was about! a quartet of actors i like (jeremy irons, juliette binoche, miranda richardson, rupert graves) wriggle their ways thru a pretentious tale riddled with pseudo-incestuous overtones, set against a numbingly corrupt government. louis malle directed ""au revoir les enfants"" and ""atlantic city"", both among my favorite films ever; this yawn fest does not join them."
5,Jeremy Irons is perfectly casted as a sexually obsessed man.,"I was very moved by this movie. Jeremy Irons portrayed accurately what obsession can do to one's life, how it can overtake all other priorities, and how it can be all-consuming, to the point of everything else is nothing."
5,I can't stop watching this movie!,I'm as obsessed with this movie as the characters are with each other! Jeremy Irons is Jeremy Irons on steroids and this performance is spectacular! I want to devour him! That's just the beginning though--everyone performs their role magnificently to create a jaw-dropping movie!
2,difficult to depict passion,"Having been blown away by the book, I was receptive to several friends' recommendation to view the film. With an all-star cast directed by Louis Malle, how bad could it be? Pretty terrible. Perhaps it's not possible to visually portray the dark urges explored so vividly in the novel. Not to disparage the performances, but I didn't understand who the characters were in relation to themselves, much less to one another. Competently crafted with excellent sets and costumes, the film was sometimes almost laughable in its determined attempt to capture the ineffable. BTW, I watched the unrated version and the interview with Louis Malle."
3,What I thought of The Dragon Of Lonley Island,This book is mainly about a group of kids that found a dragon and every time they went to see the dragon they got told a stroy. Well I thought thats somehow the writer should have put more action in. The plot was OK but kinda boring. But what happenes in the story is three stories and there is no main story line. I dunno just my opinion is that i don't really like it.
5,Tell No One,"I was browsing the book section in the grocery store today, hoping to find another true crime story. The title of this book caught my eye(I just watched 'Don't Say a Word' on DVD) and when I read the back cover, I thought, okay [that price]for a book isn't bad and the story sounds interesting. I started reading at 2:30 this afternoon and I just finished it(6:15 PM - I would have read it faster but I had to keep putting it down to make dinner and check on my kids - believe me it was hard to put this book down). I thought I had figured out what was going on about halfway through the book and I was completely wrong. When I read the last page and a half all I could say OUTLOUD was WOW, no way, WOW as the chills went up and down my spine. Excellent read, you won't put this book down until the end! Bravo to the author!!! Harlan Coben has now been put on my list of most favorite authors."
5,A Terrific Thriller,"With TELL NO ONE, Harlan Coben demonstrates in a big way that he can be terrifying and terrific even away from Myron Bolitar. The plot twists and turns as the reader learns -- or thinks he learns -- whether Elizabeth Beck was really murdered 8 years ago. And why the events of that night have come back to haunt her husband David . . . and can cause death again and again. I had to take my blood pressure when I read this one, to make sure it didn't get too high from excitement. And unlike many well-plotted but weakly written thrillers, Coben's writing here is superb. TELL NO ONE is a gem."
4,Great until the end,"I loved it--couldn't put it down but was disappointed by the final plot twist. It negated the premise of the entire story of David's (the main character) not having a clue into why someone might want his wife dead. Let's see--something like this happens and then a couple months later your wife is killed, and you just think it's a coincidence? The last plot twist just does not make sense. But it is a great mystery--just do not read the ending."
3,Could have been great,"This was my first read of a Coben novel. A fine writer and one I'll go back to, hoping for something better in his other books. For a less accomplished writer I'd ... him. For any piece of fiction the reader has to believe in the characters, in every line. The ending of this novel reveals a secret that makes all of the actions of the good doctor suspect. He never questions the disappearance and death of his wife Elisabeth, even after she's been beaten up, after he's done what he's done (I won't give away the ending); attributing it all to a serial killer. He makes all of these logical deductions (the ones involving the emails) which are actually endearing. But he's had 8 years to think about all of this and hasn't considered any other possibilities? Sorry, but his editor and first readers were asleep at the wheel. For a writer as good as this, it's the waste of an otherwise wonderful piece of writing."
2,Good start; terrible finish.,"The plot goes from intriguing to unbelievable, with lots of artificial constructs and holes in the story. It was a fun read but only up to a point, about half-way through. Then it went rapidly downhill. In the end, I felt it was shallow and manipulative of its readers.Like bad science fiction...."
5,"Exciting, fast paced read","I really enjoyed this book, I found that I could not put it down. It is a great story, something exciting going on chapter to chapter. I have never read any of Mr.Coben's books before, but this one had such great reviews, I thought I would try it. Well, I loved it. I have spent all afternoon reading it,ignoring my housework, the phone and the doorbell.(Thank goodness for caller I.D.!)Anyway, if you want an exciting thrill ride, read this book, although I do have one small complaint. At the end there is something that I think needed a little more explanation. But it doesn't really take anything away from the book as a whole, so enjoy!"
2,Great page turner marred by dumb ending,"I won't give away the end of this gripping story, but...for those who have not read it, my problem is that the 'killer' just makes the lead character more of an important part of the mystery than one ( as the storyline goes ) who is clueless and is trying to find the truth. Very disappointing conclusion that almost makes the first 99/100ths of the story meaningless."
3,Great Brain Candy!,"I first heard about this book through BookSense ( a great publication put out by independent bookstores). I had a great time reading it. The plot is simple: a man who thought his wife was murdered by a serial killer finds himself accused of that same murder eight years later. There is lots of suspense here and Harlan Coben knows how to move pages -- but for seasoned mystery readers there is nothing new. I found I enjoyed the author's running social commentary throughout the story best: Medicaid, drugs, welfare, violence. Also, Harlan Coben's over-the-top characters are plain fun to read about: Shauna (the hugely famous, plus-size, lesbian model) and Eric Wu (the shell-shocked, war-ravaged, terrifying goombah) were two of my favorites in this story.This is the first book I have read by this author and I plan on checking out his earlier work. If you are looking for a quick, easy read you cannot go wrong with this book!"
5,Find a comfortable place-- once you start you can't stop,"I decided to start reading again, so I go to the book store and pick up a best seller hoping it'll keep me reading. Keep me reading, what an underestimation-- I was hooked. I had to bring it everywhere with me! I even tried reading while I was driving."
2,wish no one would've told me,"all the unorignal characters you never wanted to meet again are here in this story. the well meaning doctor, the crooked cops, the over-bearing and plus sized lesbian, the self-important defense attorney, the gangsta drug dealer who has a really good heart. don't waste your time on this waste of time."
5,Best Book Of 2001,"Harlan Coben has done it again. Hot off the Myron Bolitar mystery series, which I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone, Coben introduces us to Dr. David Beck. Eight years after his wife is identified as a murder victim of a serial killer, he receives an e-mail that has to be from her. Throw in a crooked aristocrat with some heavy muscle, a lesbian love affair, out-of-sync police officers, and a trying-to-do-right-by-his-son drug dealer, and you have an amazing read. TELL NO ONE is the best book that I have read in the last five years. Get this book, and you will not put it down until the surprise ending. Another solid effort from Harlan Coben."
3,Why write a middle of the road review?,"David Beck's wife, Elizabeth, is inexplicably kidnapped and murdered. Eight years later David, still reeling from the loss receives an email and hyperlink showing a very quick moment of what looks to be his wife, alive!Why write a middle of the road review? Because I like Harlan Coben's stories very much. I listened to this one (audiobook), I liked it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. This story has a great premise, and it is well written and entertaining. But it had one glaring flaw for me that was like the proverbial elephant in the room; the reasoning behind Elizabeth's long disappearance rang so shallow to me. Usually, I am able to overlook something like like this, but not in a story entitled ""Tell No One"" with a premise promise like this one. If that wasn't your view then I'd say a four star is about right."
4,Great Summer Intrigue,"Dr. David Beck has managed to put his life back together in the 8 years since an attack by a serial killer which claimed the life of his wife, Elizabeth. And then one day he gets a cryptic e-mail message hinting that the sender is his dead wife - with a warning to tell no one.As he attempts to find out the source of the continuing messages, Beck finds himself not only swept up in a world of power brokers with hired assasins and witnesses who know more than they're telling, but accused by the FBI of murdering Elizabeth.This is an elegantly wrought novel of high suspense which keeps you guessing and ties up all the loose ends at just the right time. This is a perfect beach take-along for the mystery aficionado."
2,Tell Everyone It's Not That Good,"What!!!! Five stars from almost everyone....this book is just o.k., not great, not riveting, tho the ending was a surprise. Easy summer read. Why did I stick with it...who knows."
3,Not bad,"I liked this book well enough, but I can't say it is one of my favorites. This story has a lot of action and it is not a boring book, but for some reason, I just didn't really care about these characters as much as I have in other books. If you can, pick this one up at a used bookstore."
5,Tell everyone who enjoys a thriller to read this book,"Dr. David Beck is married to Elizabeth, his soulmate and childhood sweetheart. Through a senseless act of violence the love of his life is taken from him. He now is contacted, eight years later, over the internet with information that may lead Dr. Beck to believe that Elizabeth may still be alive. The clues given could only be known by Elizabeth. How can this be possible? Thus starts a roller coaster ride of a thriller. Nothing is as it seems. The twists and turns of this book are great. It is a real page turner.As I said tell everyone to read this book if you enjoy a good suspense novel."
4,Great book,"This was my first Coben book and I thought it was great! I knew nothing of his previous books but the pages flew by and I became a fan. In a previous review someone mentioned the 'horrific' dust jacket. Personally, the cover is what first caught my eye as it sat on a shelf with 300 other books. Sometimes less is more!"
5,excellent !,"I just finished this on a library loan. Really good plot, kept my attention, kept me up at night reading."
2,Save your eysight,"The story has an interesting beginning which draws the reader in, but itbecomes overly contrived and the characters are hardly more than cardboard.I like a story with some attachment to reality, but ths isn't it."
5,My New Favorite!,"I recently read this book cover to cover one night while I was babysitting. I'm not known to read in that way, so that speaks volumes about how great it was (for me, anyway). Prior to reading the novel I had never heard of Harlan Coben, so I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and cannot wait to see the movie and read more of his books. I would highly recommend the book to anyone. It is an easy read with a story line that is unlike others that I have read before."
5,The ultimate suspenseful,Caution: This book is addicting. I couldn't put it down from the moment I picked it up. If I did put it down for even a brief moment I couldn't stop thinking about it.After you think that you've solved a mystery another one is thrown at. There were many twists and I almost couldn't keep up. There was a rare mix of characters in this book. This book was incredible and literally had me at the edge of my seat. I highly recommend this book!
5,One of My Favorites!,"This book made its way into my book club. It was a suggested movie to watch, but I decided to read the book first. Amazing. I couldn't put it down. I read it within a day or two. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I understood the book the whole way through and didn't have to go back and reread anything to fully understand. I love this book. I saw the movie, which is in French. I liked it, but would have never really understood the storyline if I hadn't read the book. Great author!"
2,TELL NO ONE ABOUT THIS BOOK,"Having read and loved all of this authors ""Myron Boloitar"" series (some more than others) I was extremely disappointed in his latest attemt into the mainstream thriller genre. Characters were not developed or likable. If you can stand to wait until the last 80 pages for things to pick up, this book may be for you."
3,Tell No One....to buy this book,"It's not that the book is bad, it's just not good. It's fast-paced and you can get through it in a couple of sittings, but you come out of it feeling like you just ate fast food. I have a feeling that all of Corbin's books are predictable and cliched like this.Here are a few specific points:- Why doesn't Elizabeth ever contact David all those years? The reason of ""constant danger"" doesn't hold up to me...not for a deep love, there would be SOME way around it.- Why didn't Elizabeth's father tell his own wife? Sitting there, grieving all of those years...it doesn't make any SENSE.- Totally lame ending for Eric Wu. A hugely built up character with no payoff.- The guy in the woods. Too convenient and feels like a plot device.- Throughout the book David repeats over and over a true, honest statement, and then follows up with a ""Ridiculous, I know"" or some variant. This drove me crazy.Overall a mediocre book. Bleh."
5,an absolute stunner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I love thrillers because they never allow you to put them down and say ""Ok, I'll continue tomorrow"" and this qualifies as one of the best thrillers ever written. This book has a lot of plot twists but Coben never loses his aim: terrifying tension!!!Thriller fans and Christopher Pike fans will like this."
2,Stick with Myron Bolitar!,"I'm an open-minded chap, but this novel just doesn't cut it (and it's a real decline from just about any of Coben's Myron Bolitar novels). Its premise is thin, the plot is predictable and Coben's attempts to build suspense and throw in twists at the end fall far short.Stick with Myron Bolitar!"
2,Tell No One,The book was listed as GOOD. Actually the pages were yellow and the spine was broken. Very surprising because I have ordered GOOD books and this is way below the average of past GOOD
2,Avoid,"I am not a book reviewer but feel compelled to add a note or two about what I consider one of the worse written books I have ever read. Now, I have been a big fan of Halan Coben and have read most, if not all, of his prior novels. Therefore, I was very anxious to read this novel. But disappointed I was! What happened? Has Coben stooped to having college students write the novels for him? If this novel left out a single sophomoric clique, I would like to know what it is. Suffice to say, don't waste you money or time on this novel."
3,Book Club Express!,"The excellent pacing of Tell No One keeps you reading so quickly that you don't notice the superficial characters, the politically correct attitude, or the flawed logic of the story until you have finished the novel, at which point you cock your head to the side and say, ""huh?"" This was a selection of my book club and we finished the discussion in record time; we started at 7:30 and finished at 8:00. I was in my car at 8:15. After saying it was a ""fun"" read, this nonliterary book provided little to discuss since we did not care to spend the evening simply bashing it. Book Club drive through express!"
2,Very ingenuous and superficial plot...,"I bought this book out of curiosity, since Coben is a bestseller and I like crime fiction. But this book was a disappointment. I won't spoil it for you, but the plot is very superficial and ingenuous. The protagonist lost his wife years ago and, suddenly, starts receiving misterious messages that may cast some light into her death. The idea looks interesting, but the result is not. My impression is that the autor started to wtite from the ending, and made up a story just to fill the pages. And the ending itself, supposedly conceived to amaze, in fact dos not add up with the protagonist's personality, as it is build throughout the book. If you are not experienced in crime fiction, you may find it entertaining. If you like more mature writing, try somewhere else."
5,Tell No One? TELL EVERYONE!!!,"WAIT...I've told EVERYONE. I read this book years ago and it continues to be the best mystery I've ever read. I became a huge Harlan Coben fan and went back and read every book he's written and continue to do so (I love his Myron Bolitar series as well with a hint of comic relief while unlocking the clues of murder). I bought ""Tell No One"" because I continue to tell people about it but never had my own copy. This one is NOT going in my lending library - Tell No One is all mine. So seriously, tell no one because I don't want them stealing my copy. Seriously."
2,Convoluted and disappointing,"Tell No One by Harlan Coben is about a man that believes his wife may still be alive 8 years after being supposedly murdered by a serial killer. This is the first novel by Mr. Coben and I was really impressed for most of the book. However, I felt there were too many twists to the story, and the narrative was too mixed up to tie all the events together. Even after finishing the book, I'm confused as to what exactly happened and why. The book alternates between first and third person, with the first person holding back information until the end. It just felt weird to me. On the plus side, it was an engaging story that kept me reading, but I felt like I needed to take notes for a test at the end."
4,Good holiday reading,"This book is good holiday reading, but is not as sophisticated as I had expected. Enjoyable but not 'Big Literature'."
1,A good reminder of what litterature should be,"In the long categorizing of things, there's for example books to read on the beach, and there's books to read on the toilet.This one is a perfect companion for the latter category (if you're done with Marc Levy's complete works).One of the worst texts I've put my eyes on the past few years - at least it reminded me that I should celebrate diversity more often."
3,not a COMPLETE waste of time,"After reading the first few chapters of this book it was pretty easy to see what the outcome of the book was going to be. However it was not easy at all to see how the author was going to get there. There are many twists and turns to the story and while I enjoyed the ""connections"" that the main character uses to get out of trouble, I was not entirely satisfied when I finished the book. Coben does a decent job of grabbing your hand and pulling you along Beck's life, and I REALLY wanted to see how we got to the end. The final pages were a bit far-fetched and involving characters that were not fully developed (re:Beck's father-in-law and Scope,Sr.). Final note: I'll pass the book on to someone instead of donating it."
3,a fun ride that ultimately crashes ..,"'Tell No One' by Harlan Coben starts of very nicely. Mysterious murders, nice guy leading man trying to find the truth, sinister baddies appear continuously, and the story becomes more and more complex and interesting. Coben also writes is a very lucid style, with all the characters being well drawn. So it is shame that he goes wild in the last 20% of the book in trying to pull together all the loose ends and instead twists the entire plot from barely believable to utterly preposterous. It seems that the author got too fanciful and caught up in the narrative. In the end I feel that all the reading enjoyment was snuffed out.Bottom line: author creates an interesting story before hitting the self-destruct button. Missable."
5,Edge of my seat,"It's clique I know, but Coban's novels always have me on the edge of my seat. Well, at least this one and Gone for Good. I think I've found one of my new favorite suspense writers. This guy is great!I loved this book because one- it's fast paced. You're not bored to death at the unimportant details of this guy's life. Two- the characters are likable. I love how at certain parts he's talking to you. Three- you don't have any idea how it will end up. But he feeds you enough along the way, so that you, like the character are figuring somethings out in the process.This book was a fun read, it went by very quickly. If you're looking for a new author to try and you like authors like James Patterson, Michael Connelly or John Grisham, I'd recommend this book."
2,"Too stuip, fun for the simple minded......","I don't know how this got as many good stars as it did. I'll keep this short since there are so many long reviews that tell you everything but the dedication. Overall the plot had a good premise. But, the characters aren't well developed. Toward the end of the book it pretends to be a thriller. It is a easy read, and yes somewhat enjoyable. Nothing that I would EVER recommend to someone."
2,Five stars? Four Stars? Three Stars? No way!,"Great premise...a good read but only up to a point, about half-way through. Then, Mr.Coben spoiled it with his politically correct speech, cardboard characters and predictable plot twists.It's a pity!"
3,Standard Thriller Fare,"This book is entertaining and will keep you engaged, but the characters are the typical flat, somewhat over the top characters you find in most thrillers these days. I didn't see anything remarkable about this writer, he is pretty typical of the genre these days: the book is plot-driven and about as deep as a two-year-old's wading pool. That said, it delivers what most people want, which is a fast pace and enought plot twists to keep you going. I had it figured out about a third of the way through, though."
3,An author worth following,"This is the third Coben novel I've read. All were enjoyable, but each is dragged down by Coben's penchant for complex plots that often veer into the unbelievable. He also has an unfortunate tendency to carry some characters from one novel to another. This is particularly grueling because Coben's characters aren't well developed to begin with.All that said and done, Coben is a thoroughly enjoyable read.His plots, as stretched as they become, have a glow of craftsmanship to them. They definitely do propel you through the story. The characters, flat as they often are, still have enough heft to keep your interest.In short, Coben and in this case ""Tell No One"" are just plain fun reads. They will keep your interest. I intend to pursue all of Coben's novels, not only because they are fun reading, but because this writer has a future and could indeed turn out to be one of the best suspense novelists of all time. It's kind of fun to watch his growth.Jerry"
2,what is all the fuss about?,"This book is certainly an easy read and a page-turner, and yes, it has a neat little twist at the end. But I didn't believe in a single one of the characters; they were nothing but cardboard cut-outs. Of course, the hero (and all of his friends) are extremely clever, and the police are all extremely stupid (and malicious). The story regarding the disappearance of the wife is laughable in its implausability. I really wanted to like this book, but just can't give it a good rating."
3,Eh...,"This got a pretty good review in the Washington Post Book World so I decided to read it. I don't know...the narrator being best buddies with a drug dealer who's always there to watch his back...? I just didn't buy that AT ALL. That kind of thing was done better and much more believably in ""Marathon Man"" years ago. And the ending -- where the heck did that come from? I also found it ludicrous that the rich guy-baddie would break into a house all alone to do his own ""wet work."" Don't guys like that hire thugs to do that FOR them? Like I said, eh...."
5,Strap yourself in!!,"I read this novel some time ago, but i still feel compelled to contradict Mr Coben's request and TELL EVERYONE!It is undoubtedly the best novel i have ever read, due mainly to its ability to take a tired genre (the love story) and inject a new lease of life effortlessly into it. Coben takes you to a chapters apex only to drag your attention away to another scene, this would be annoying if the subsequent scene wasn't just as excellent.I could discuss the plot & the characters, but some things can not be described through words...so how come Coben does it with such ease?This book runs on rocket fuel, by the time you have finished it feels like you have just started, indeed, by the time you have finished you will wish you have just started!"
1,Put me off reading another Coben,"This was my first, and last, Coben novel. It was recommended by someone who's read every book the guy's written, and shares a love of a few authors I really enjoy. Mr Coben will not be one of them.The writing is the most juvenile I've ever read by a popular writer. Those who call the plot contrite are being overly generous. I had to actually FORCE myself to finish it. Never again."
5,I didn't see it coming!,"This is the first book of Harlan Coben's I have come across, which is surprising since I am an avid mystery fan. It seemed to be plodding along predictably for me...Right up to the last two or three chapters. Then it twisted off and I never saw it coming.Looking up more of Mr. Coben's books right now! It was great!"
5,THIS BOOK HAD EVERYTHING!!!,"This was one fantastic book! It was the first book I read by Harlan Coben, but what a place to start! It had mystery, suspense and it never failed to make me keep turning pages, no matter how tired I got at night!! I couldn't put it down! If you're a fan of mysteries with great character development, this book is for you!"
1,Skip This and Go To The Next Myron Bolitar,"Coben is way out of his league here in his attempt to concoct a serious thriller. The plot makes no sense with numerous inconsistencies, and the characters are equally implausible. His Myron Bolitar novels are also implausible, but light and funny, with comic book characters so over the top I laugh out loud. This is a different and much more difficult genre for him altogether, and I couldn't wait for this experiment to end."
2,What You Don't Know Can Hurt You-Unsolved Mystery,"Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads ""Tell No One."" Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end."
5,An Excellent Book,"I think that this may be one of the most exciting books that I have ever read! It is a real page turner with twists and turns at every corner. Some may have thought that it was a tad unbelieveable but so are soap operas yet millions still watch them, to me thats the point of a good novel to get wraped up in a non-reality so to speak. I've given this book to my entire family and they all LOVE it and continue to pass it on. I give it 5 Stars!!!!!!"
3,A little too sappy at times,"A good story with a compelling plot, but a little too sappy for my tastes. Overall I enjoyed the book. It's an easy read and Eric Wu was a fearful bad guy. But Beck is just not a strong enough lead character. Bring back Myron and Win."
4,Surprises At Every Turn,I recently joined a neighborhood book club and this is the second book we have read. I am almost disappointed that it read it so fast... now I have to wait weeks before we meet to discuss. It is a fast read and full of surprises. I enjoyed it very much. I think it would make a great movie! The book is action packed and I was very surprised at many of the plot twists and I could never guess what was happening next. I recommend it.
2,Ordinary People,"After several people told me this was great fun, I plunked down my [money] and looked forward to a fast paced, thrill ride. Unfortunately, it reads more like a how -to -write- a -mystery -and -hope- the -movie -people -buy -it -book. I finished it but only to see just how dull it could be...I wasn't disappointed."
2,Thanks for the warning,If this is better than his other books I won't bother with reading them. So many twists and turns it was totally unbelievable. I know its fiction but give me a break.........
1,Easy to shrug off this story,"The book starts out with a catchy premise but rapidly goes downhill (or is it nowhere?). The characters are cardboard (or styrofoam) and the plot just too outlandish. Honestly, it reads like it was written by a ninth-grader with a great imagination but little knowledge of the writing craft. I can't believe this book was a bestseller or that so many people recommended this author to me. I'm certainly not tempted to try any of his other works."
3,Mixed Feelings,The writing style is choppy and overly dramatic. It seemed like a parody or a movie script in parts. The characters seemed like somewhat changed retreads from the Bolitar series. But the plot was fun and full of surprises.
4,Keeps You On The Edge Of Your Seat!!!,"For Dr. David Beck, the loss was shattering. The peircing screams. The night his wife was taken. The last night he saw her alive. Now eight years later, Dr. David Beck recieves an message on his computer, a phrase that only he and his dead wife know. Beck is now taunted with the impossible... his dead wife, Elizabeth, may be alive... or is it all a hoax.Tell No One is a suspense. You won't be able to put it done. It's full of twists and plots. Things that are unexpected, happen. A book this size usually would take me a few days to finish, but I finished it in one day. I couldn't put it done."
2,Interesting plot twists,"The first time I started reading this book, I put it aside due to its violence. If you're used to graphic violence in books, it won't bother you at all, but if most of your experience with thrillers comes from Agatha Christie instead of Stephen King, it might bother you.After a week or so, though, I came back to the book, because I absolutely had to see how it ended. The plot twists were, in hindsight, not very original, but while you're following them, they do indeed keep you on your toes. The suspense finally got to me -- I had to figure out who was sending David these e-mails.The deletion of the two hit-men would make this book a much more pleasant read, and detract from the plot and suspense very little."
4,Excellent plot with surprising twists!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this new offering from Mr. Coben. It had everything needed for an enjoyable read. If the main character, Dr. David Beck was flawed, then it only made him more human and believable a character. I was surprised by the ending, but maybe the dog days of summer have fried my brain. This was a fun read, which I did not find predictible. The other characters were interesting as well - it becomes boring and trite reading about perfect, beautiful characters living in their perfect worlds."
2,It wasn't what I thought!,"I was very disappointed in the writing style of the author. The plot of the mystery was fairly interesting, yet the style of writing distracted me from it. I thought the writing was juvenile and phrasing of dialogue very conversational. I had read a few excellent reviews about it. I also notice the reviews from the Amazon readers- so maybe it is just my taste!"
5,lived up to hype,"i truly enjoyed this book--not necessarily because it was incredibly well-written, but because it told a great story and kept me guessing until the end!!!"
2,Tell No One Who Reads Good Books,"A decent junk food read, I suppose, although most of it was half-baked. The ending annoyed me, as did most of the characterizations and the implausibility of major parts of the plot. Regarding the characters and the author's mini-dissertations throughout: Was the author trying to be PC and instructive rather than horribly condescending? My ambivalence toward the book was there from start to finish--I did turn the pages to see what happened, and then I felt manipulated and disappointed."
5,Babble to Everyone!,"David Beck believes his wife, Elizabeth, is dead and so do her parents as well as her friends. So, when Beck sees what he believes to be proof that Elizabeth is not only alive but wants contact with him, he doesn't have to be told to ""Tell No One"" since he doubts anyone would believe him anyway. This book definitely deserves to be filed under the can't-put-it-down category. ""Tell No One"" is the first Harlan Coben book I've read, and based on the writing alone, I'll be checking out other books he's done. Coben's characters are well defined, and his plotting is excellent. Eric Wu is a character to make your toes curl at the mere mention of his name, and Tyrese makes it very difficult to look at men in his line of work the same way ever again. I'm definitely telling all my friends about this book, and my guess is that they'll do exactly the same thing. It's that good."
3,Entertaining but with no surprises,"This was a quick, entertaining read without a lot of substance. Given the reviews I read prior to purchasing the book, I was surprised to find that the plot was so predictable. The characters were interesting, but there is nothing new here. I broke my policy about buying only paperbacks when I bought this book, and boy do I regret it."
5,Coben delivers the goods again,"I'll admit, I was looking forward to a new Myron Bolitar novel, and although I still am, Tell No One was an excellent book in the interim. The plot is very engrossing, is Elisabeth really alive or is someone playing games with Dr. Beck? The book moves at a lightning pace with plenty of twists and no dull spots. The ending is also great with a very suprising revelation. This is a must read for mystery and thriller fans. I look forward to Harlans next book, whatever it is about, but as good as this was, I do hope that there will be more Myron in the future."
4,Really a fun ride!,"I listened to this marvelous book on tape and truly enjoyed it. This is only the 2nd book I've read by Coben...he was suggested by another woman in the doctor's office. (Ask someone who they're reading and you're liable to find some great authors!) Everyone else has given an overview of the story in their reviews and I'd have to agree with all of them...it's the tale of true loss and grief and a really twisted mystery that carries you urgently to the last page. There are several great mystery authors out there, Vince Flynn whose books are the scenario for the popular 24 series, Jonathan Kellerman, Stephen White, James Patterson, Robin Cook, Susan Isaacs, Linda Howard,Stephen King, and countless others, but now I've added to my list of favorites, Harlan Coben!"
4,Exciting Ride!!,"This was my first book by Harlan Coben, and I was not disapointed in the least! Usually in books there are parts that are slow but not with this author. Every moment was excitement around the corner and I couldn't wait to turn the next page to see what was going to happen next. Great book, now I'm reading 'Just One Look"" by him also."
2,Tell Everyone It's Not That Good,"What!!! Five stars from almost everyone....I feel quite alone in my opinion but that's o.k. This book is just so-so, not great, not riveting, though the book improved toward the end. An easy summer read if you don't have to concentrate too hard."
1,I Will Tell No One to Buy This Book!,"A little half-way thru the book, I kept wondering ""where is the story?' I very rarely put a book in the ""trade"" pile without reading it, but this one went there quickly. I didn't care about any of the characters, I didn't care what really happened to anyone in the book. Gone For Good was pretty good, No Second Chance was very good - - what happened, Harlan???"
1,Poor Beyond Belief,"Here are some tips from your humble reviewer.1. Never buy a book by an author you do not know where the onlyblurb on the book is from other authors.2. Never buy a book where the blurb from the ""author-reviewers""includes cliches like ""gut wrenching suspense"".3. Never buy a ""Scooby Doo"" novel. That is one with so fewcharacters that either (a) the bad guy is obvious or (b) yourealise they all could have done it and you are just waiting forthe author to pick the guilty party.4. ""Scooby Doo"" never had ( cliche alert ) a ""slam bang surpriseending"" - and neither does this book, despite what one of theearnest ""author-reviewers"" says.This book is incredibly poor. AND it is going to be a movie ????My recommendation is.........Avoid."
4,"I challenge you to ""TELL NO ONE!""","Has anyone ever told you a secret, and asked you not tell anyone? If did tell someone, you could risk their and yours. In this story, someone has burried a secret in the past, and they will do anything to keep it there. Who can Beck trust? He's not sure he can even trust himself. Maybe it's some kind of sick joke. Or maybe he's just dreaming. I'm not telling! You'll have to read it to find out. I think you'll be suprised, as I was. Ok, I will tell you this, the truth comes out in the end. If you love mystery/suspence stories with a lot of action, I highly recommend, Harlan Coben's, Tell No One!"
4,"I challenge you to ""TELL NO ONE!""","Has someone ever told you a secret, and asked you not to tell anyone? In this story, someone has dug up a secret from the past, that others want to keep burried. The main character is told, to ""tell no one."" He finds out, if he tells anyone, it could be deadly. Can he trust anyone? Is this some kind of sick joke, or is he just dreaming? Read it and find out. I think you'll be suprised! I will ""tell you this,"" the truth comes out in the end. If you love mystery/suspence stories, I highly recommend, Harlan Coben's, Tell No One!"
4,Tell No One,"Harlan Coben's book: TELL NO ONE is very much better than the French Movie version...even though it was a good movie...it left out 3/4 of theexciting book, that's what happens when you have to squeez things down toa shorter screen time! Too bad!"
4,Tell No One Review,"The storyline is Dr. David Beck receives an email from his supposedly dead wife, which sets in motion a boatload of events that uncover the circumstances of her death 8 years ago.This book, as well as other Coben works, really reads quickly and always keeps you guessing. It loses a star only because too much is unloaded at the end of the story...I think it might have worked out better if there had been one or two less twists. Still, a great story that is gripping from beginning to end.Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys a good mystery."
5,"Suspensful Summer Read-First Coben book I've read, but not the last!","One cannot help feel for Dr Beck,losing the love of his life when they have known each other since childhood. He is dealing, or at least trying to deal, understand and cope with the loss over these past 8 years.The mystery starts when he is teased with the thought his beloved wife might still be alive. His sister-in-law,Shanua,tells him this is more than likely clever computer trickery, but Dr Beck..has hope and that is what it takes for him to ask more about the facts around her death. The FBI also what to now more, and soon belive its Dr Beck that killed his wife. I read this book in one day on vacation. Excellent, easy to read with rich characters."
5,WOW!,"This was the first time i have ever read anything by Harlan Coben, cause i'm more of a romance, horror/fantasy kinda of a reader. But a friend told me i had to read this book and once i started reading it i could not stop until i was done! I literally inhaled this book. It was awesome, where some books it takes a while to get into, this book grabs you from the get go! I would recommend this book to everyone!"
4,Great entertainment!,"This is the second book by Harlan Coben I read (first is 'Gone For Good'). Both are exceptionally well written and have everything: great plot that keeps you guessing till the end, good characters development, etc. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book five stars is that somehow it reminds me the first his book I read (I am not sure which one was printed first). The theme of missing woman, which is actually hiding, is just too similar. Other than that great mistery novel."
4,Entertaining and Quick,"Usually I read history and biographies but every once in a while I like to read a mystery or thriller. Something that I can read quickly and not have to invest too much of myself in. This book fits that qualification well. The main characters were well thought out and very interesting. They have more dimensions that most books of this genre usually endow their characters with. The story is very fast paced and carefully plotted. A young doctors loses his wife and while not adjusting well, has come to accept the fact that she is gone. The without warning, he receives e-mail messages which leads him to believe she is still alive. This sets off an interesting search. Other characters, such as the lesbian lover of the husband's sister and the friends who try to help him in his quest, are also very well captured.I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking for a bit of a diversion. This is the perfect summertime ""beach book""."
3,Not brilliant; but not bad either,"Unfortunately this is a very average thriller. The plot is great; David Beck is attacked and left for dead when his wife is kidnapped and brutally murdered. Eight years later, he receives a mysterious email which suggests that his wife may not have died after all... what a great hook for a reader! The novel, however, is rambling and by the end, I was desperate to finish and skim-read the book not because I cared about the characters, but so that I could find out whether Elizabeth Beck was, in fact, dead or not. The characterisation was pretty average too. In summary, a good story but not a book that is going to keep you gripped on the edge of your seat."
3,"This was a pretty fun, but sort of cheesy, mystery novel.","This book came highly recommended to me, and I must admit, I was not as impressed as I expected to be. Despite the fast pacing, I found the plot itself to be easy to predict. There were a lot of exciting scenes that felt very cinematic in scope - and after learning about the French version, I definitely plan on renting it. I read it in one sitting though, and I would read another book by this author, though I may not rush out to go get one. The characters were a little stiff, but what surprised me the most was the level of pure sappy romance in the book. It spoiled the tone for me, a bit, but overall, this was a fast and fun read."
4,"Good, but maybe one twist too many","I found this book to be a real page turner. And, after all, isn't that what you want in a mystery? So, maybe I should give it the fifth star. But, there were so many improbable twists and turns that I kind of felt betrayed by the final one. Almost like the author was showing off so I'd know how clever he could be.Still, the writing is good enough that I plan to read another Coben book. And, if you like crime mysteries at all, you might be pleased if you read this book or another of his works. He clearly has big league writing talent."
5,"Harlan, where have you been all my life??","Actually, I was looking up customer reviews for another mystery book, and someone suggested Harlan Coben. Well, I wish to thank that person, as well as Amazon for having this review section. What an incredible ""page turner"". My mom and I are hooked. She went on to read two more Coben books and she raves about them. Keep writing, Mr. Coben!!"
4,fast paced,"This book was my second Harlen Coben. It is a fast paced , suspense novel, with lots of twist's and turn's .It revolves around Dr. David Beck , who's wife was killed 8 year's earlier. An e-mail from beyond the grave is what starts the good Dr. on a thrill ride that you will enjoy."
3,Not bad,"When you lose someone you love, time eventually closes the wound a bit and you hurt a little less. Not so for Dr. David Beck, who's wife was abducted and killed 8 years ago. He's still wrapped up in Elizabeth's death, as if it just happened yesterday. Beck receives a strange email containing references to things only he and his deceased wife would know. Someone wants him to think Elizabeth is still alive. Beck ""tells no one,"" as instructed, but searches for the truth and uncovers many unexpected truths along the way.Good mystery that answers all questions asked during the read. Something about the writing style bothered me - I just can't place it. Mostly in descriptions, I found myself missing what was just read and having to constantly go back. I thought I was just tired, but it happened all through the book. I'll try another Coben book and see what's up."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read!,"TELL NO ONE kept me busy. This isn't my usual book choice, but a friend gave it to me, so I decided to give it a go. I was hooked from the beginning.David Beck is the ultimate sweetheart-his loyal, he's honest (mostly!), and he cares deeply for the ones he loves. I kept with him throughout his awful seasrch for his ""dead"" wife...all the while getting thrown by awesome twists and turns.. There are surprises until the very last page! Couldn't put it down! I can't wait to try some of his other books!"
2,Why switch narrators???,"I was wowed up until chapter 5, very Hitchcockian. BUT!! Suddenly he switches narrators, from 1st to third, then every other chapter the narrator switches back and forth, even within the chapters themselves. Most annoying. Harlan is clearly a good writer but this book would have been so much better if it were all in the third person or he wrote a slightly different story with the 1st person point of view."
2,Huh?,"Too tricky for its own good, this story never grabs hold of your emotion or wills you to suspend your disbelief. If you need a page turner to pass the time,this will do, but don't expect more."
4,Nice Book,"This one was interesting to say the least, kept me reading, although parts of it were a little predictable, I would recommend the book."
3,"What was not ""proven"" by Prof Tyler,could not make sense......","As prof Tyler is not alive anymore and as I don't know what changed in the new edition, I would suggest the book only for those who would like to have a ""honest insight"" in the herbs that Prof Tyler seems to have studied.Indeed we should not forget that Tyler had a huge knowledge and was highly respected in his field as I understood.To write that a herb is ""useless"" just because nothing special was discovered in the laboratory [until now] is just American short sightness [myopia], as has so often be the case in all areas of medicine in the U.S.A.I think things are rapidly changing to the good."
2,Not a good Herbal Book!!!,"Tylers books seem to try to keep people from trusting in herbs, God's intended healers..... He considers such mild herbs, such as catnip, toxic. He uses a stupid example for it, to. Fermented catnip tea and raisins.... Stay away from this book, unless you are against herbs...."
1,Rubbish,"This man hates the use of herbs for health reason and this book is nothing but rubbish. If you are actually interested in the use of herbs then I would suggest you look into another book. If you are interested in spreading hate about herbalists then this is the book for you.The title is definately false advertising. Honest and ""anti"" opinionated is not the same thing."
1,Insulting,"People really need to investigate other herbal sources before holding this one in high regard. It seems like Tyler is more determined to be anti-herb than anything else, shunning even herbs that have been shown to be safe in numerous studies and years of use. He even goes as far as to be smugly insulting toward modern herbalists with some of his comments. Countless errors decorate the pages - or should I say soil them? - and there's really nothing I can say about this book that would get this taste out of my mouth. [...]It's true we need to get the word out about this book, but not as a recommended read."
3,Early Hezekiah,This collection of songs is nice. My mother came across a tapedversion of it and I listened to it. If you like the old gospelstyle with the new age twist then this is for you.You can't go wrong with this one because Hezekiah @ LFCCare lifting up the NAME OF THE LORD in song.
3,NOT BAD BUT NOT GOOD AN OK CD,"THIS CD WAS WHEN HEZEKIAH FIRST CAME OUT AND HAD A FEW CD OUT. THIS CD IS NOT BAD, IT'S NOT GODD BUT ITS OK. SOME SONGS JUST DONT DO ANYTHING FOR ME. MAYBE I NEED TO LISTEN TO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECUASE I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT. HEZEKIAH WALKER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GOSPEL SINGER. I GUESS THAT ALL ARTIST HAVE THIER WEAKNESS AND THIS IS ONE OF HIS. IF YOU LIKE OLD SCHOOL THEN THIS WILL DO IT. BUT IF YOU LIKE NEW SCHOOL THEN THIS WOULDNT BE FOR YOU I JUST REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS CD."
3,"a good story, worth checking out...","Despite a few typos, this story features well rounded characters in a complete fictionized world. The story takes a few interesting turns and goes in some directions I hadn't expected. This is a good first attempt from this author and I recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi/Fantasy stories."
3,ok...puts her to sleep,Neat story... if I had it to do over again...I would not have purchased it. Not one of my favorites...at all!
5,A positive classic for young children,"My parents read this to me when I was a child and now I've bought it for my two year old. It's a great, quick read for a bedtime story and has boats, water and other themes that seem to work with kids. This is a story of adventure that ends with the tugboat getting back to his family."
5,Wonderful for children,"My son loves this story. It's a very heartwarming, original story that little boys and girls will enjoy. We love Little Golden Books."
3,reliving my childhood,"While some of my childhood favorites have proved timeless, Scuffy the tugboat is not one of them. Oh well, you can't have everything."
5,"""This is the life for me.""","Scuffy the Tugboat and His Adventures Down the River has remained a favorite bedtime read for my 2-year-old and 5-year-old sons. I also remember it well from my own childhood, and my mother read it to me because she had enjoyed it when she was a little girl. The way in which the stream gradually grows into a large river and the river finally opens into the vast sea makes for an amazing journey. Along the way, we meet cows and owls and loggers, and we watch as armies of men battle springtime floods. Tibor Gergely's illustrations are detailed and distinct as always, and they evoke a time now long gone, filled with such things as streetcars and polka dot ties.I also recommend Tibor Gergely and Margaret Wise Brown's The Seven Little Postmen."
5,Great story and CD,"My 3-year-old got to know the picture book at his grandma's, and when we tried the CD, he listened to it over and over. He continues to enjoy it months later. The narrator has an engaging voice, and the sound effects really add a lot to the story's appeal."
5,A PEERLESS VOICE SINGS HIS COUNTRY.,"KRAUS HAD NO PEER WHEN IT CAME TO ZARZUELA TENOR ROLES, AS THIS VERY EARLY RECORDING DEMONSTRATES. IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND IT AND WHEN YOU DO, THE PRICE TENDS TO BE STEEP, SO LOOK AROUND BEFORE YOU BUY. . . . BY THE WAY, THE VILLAZON RECORD IS A BLOW BY BLOW REPRODUCTION OF AN EARLY KRAUS RECORDING, AND HE IS SO WELL COACHED BY DOMINGO HIS SOUND IS ALMOST IDENTICAL!"
2,Great product..if you like to sew!,"UPDATED: after a year of ownership, I've had to had the legs, crotch, and back of knee's sewn. Thread used is substandard.PROS: Pants go on easy due to liner, feel substantial, has CE armor in knees.CONS: Leather is coming apart right below the bottom of the crotch zipper after only a month. For 200$, you shouldn't have to sew your pants together! Would have rated product a 5 star otherwise. Save your reciept! READ Extrememoto Returns & Refunds!"
2,Not so great,"After the astounding Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 from Burning Spear, I expected that this would be just as great. To my dissapointment, the rhythms were too sweet and watered down to cmpare with the heavy dub sounds on Vol. 1 and 2. Go for those, save this for later."
2,Poor quality but what would you expect for the price?,"Pros:Plenty of games to choose fromColor screenLooks coolCons:Games are horrible, may find a couple you likeSound is horribleThe player will freeze or restart often while your playing"
5,Burning Spear *Appointment W/His Majesty,"I cannot say enough about Burning Spear, he just takes me to a whole different level whenever I listen to him. He brings my spiritual side up to the top level. He is such an inspiration!"
5,Spear is the Bomb!,"I've followed 'Spear' for about 7 years now. A very dear friend of mines is the lead trumpet player of the group, James Smith aka 'Supe'. A very fine gentleman from down south. Say, could you possibly tell me how I could find out when 'Spear' will be playing in North Carolina again? And ask James to give Dee a call in Charlotte, NC on my toll free number. Thanks! Loving Spear in the South"
5,Science in Poetry,"This anthology covers several areas of science, but breaks them into catagories: Subject is Science; Observations of the Natural World; Science as Metaphor; and Satire and Criticism of Science. It is prefaced by an interesting dialogue and includes biolgraphical notes of all the authors. Sciences include: astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, physics. Poets include Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson to Annie Dillard and many contemporary American poets. Recommended."
2,Autism,"I read a review of this book in the Telegraph and was under the impression the book was about autism. As my husband is autistic I thought I would gain a new insight into this illness. Unfortunately the book describes post-war Britain, which in itself is very depressing, as well as the author's marriage to a man who is criminally insane. I did not find any references to autism (as I know it) in the book, except perhaps the fact that he lives in himself and is unable communicate. The violent physical attacks on the author I can not associate with autism. Also the ending is a bit strange, in as far as her daughter stays in contact and has a good relationship with him. Her sadness at his death is bewildering. All in all I can say I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for help in dealing with autism."
4,great daytime walk around lens,"I bought this lens when i bought my Canon XSi back in May. Its a great ""walk around"" lens. it covers a huge spectrum of range. For daylight photography and with a flash it works very well. My only real complaint is that its heavy and a little big... but this is expected with the 18 to 200 range.IS works very well. At the 150 to 200mm range there is a noticeable difference between IS turned on and Off.pared with the canon 50mm f 1.4 i think i have all the glass i'll need for a while. now its just a matter of learning how to use it well."
3,Autofocus is not accurate,"I bought the lens. Most of the reviewers in this series are right. I just want to emphasize one thing. It's hard to get the autofocus right with this lens. The autofocused point is near than the desired distance. I'm using a Canon 40D. Most of the shots with autofocus are soft. Otherwise, it's pretty good except with some chromatic aberration occasionally. I don't what I should do now. Anybody has any suggestion?"
4,Tough & still takes great shots!,"I do amature rodeo photography & purchased this exact lens last year about this time. Since that time I've taken over 8000 photos & for the most part they're all great (some blurry due to operator error!)! I recently purchased a new camera, but am keeping my old camera as a back up so decided to put the old lens with the old camera & I'm purchasing a new one for my new camera. These lens are tough...mine gets banged around quite a bit...but they still take awesome photos. In dust, mud, humidity & extreme heat they do an awesome job. I can take close up shots (have done some portrait shots) or shots at a distance...they all look great! This lens is a great lens for a 'beginner' photographer like myself! Inexpensive but still produces shots that people are willing to purchase! All in all I'd say a great lens for the price!!!"
4,OS is very useful!,"For the price, this is a very good lens. My hands are a bit shaky, so the OS is very helpful. It's noisy, but mostly I do nature photos, so who cares! I like the wide field of view at the front end also. It's now my everyday lens."
3,Great lens for the money,"Picked this lens up as the first one to go with my Canon T2i. I'm no expert by any stretch but so far so good. Pictures come out great, zoom range is good and the stabilization really helps with the tight zoom situations. My only criticism so far is the auto-focus has trouble in low light situations or dark subjects (black dog at dusk, forget about it). Worst case I've had it spend 7 or 8 seconds hunting around for focus. Other than that the build quality is pretty solid and it is well priced."
5,"So far, I'm totally in love!","I just got this lens in the mail a few days ago. Yes I probably should wait a little longer before writing a review...so I may do an update later.But so far, I am absolutely in love!I am a professional photographer in Virginia and have been slowly building up my camera equipment. I am also a minimalist so I don't always believe you have to have the fanciest camera to get those amazing shots. All you need is a sturdy body and a good lens.This lens was exactly what I wanted. I needed something to go from wide to zoom without me having to change lenses. When I'm doing a wedding I don't always have time to do that.(So far) The photos I've taken are crisp and bright. I've barely had to do any editing with contrast or color or anything. I'm really thrilled with the quality.The motor is a little loud. I do agree with that. The focus is a tiny bit slow... but honestly those things aren't that big of a deal for me."
5,excellent,"The lens works very well creating sharp images in challenging situations. The fact that it starts at 18mm as opposed to 28mm as many the OS zooms do and extends to 200mm give me the flexibility to truly have a ""one lens solution."""
3,Thinking twice about this purchase,"Keeping things short and sweet, I purchased this lens because I wanted a lens to cover the two lenses I once owned. The focal length capabilities of this lens is great, really gets the job done. However, using auto-focus is out with this lens while attached to my D5000. It will eventually get there and you can get the shot, but to shorten the wait time, use the manual focus because it will be ever so much faster."
4,heavy,"I tried this lens briefly and returned it, not because of any quality issue, but because of how heavy it is. 22oz vs. 12 oz. for my old Tamron non-stabilized lens. Depends on what your priorities are. Mine was weight."
4,wonderful lens,I received the len which was packed carfully. The len itself is very beautiful and the picture is beautiful too.
4,NEED HELP with better QUALITY,"HELP ME TO PLACE LENSES IN ORDER OF YOUR PRIORITY for Quality pics.(What goes first,second etc.)Sigma 18-250 f3.5Sigma 18-200 f3.5Sigma 28-200Tokina 24-200 (it's OK for Canon?)Canon 28-135 f3.5Canon 18-200 f3.5Thank you"
4,Great all around lens!,"I've had this lens for a long time now and it has been my most used lens. It was recomended to me by a friend and I'm glad I took his advice and bought it. It has a great range that will suit your needs. Although it is not the fastest lens, with enough light (or flash), it does the trick.Pros:- Great all around lens.- The focal range is what makes it my most used lens.- The weight is okay but it can get tiring around the neck. One way to alleviate that is if you carry a backpack with all your gear, attach your camera strap to the backpack (top art). This will relieve the pressure from your neck and the backpack will counter-weight the lens/camera.- Price is right for what you get.Cons:- The focus is a little slow.- Sometimes the the autofocus is not too accurate but if your doing still shots, just use manual focus.Overall, I was happy with the lens. This is a great starting lens for beginners."
3,Fantastic until it broke,"The zoom range for this lens makes it a great all purpose ""non-pro"" lens. Perfect for travel as it goes from nominal wide-angle to telephoto. That's the good news.The bad news is after two years of not-too-frequent use, I turned the zoom ring and something snapped inside. The lens is toast -- I can physically move the lens barrel in and out for zoom, but the focus doesn't seem to work -- auto or manual. It's headed back to Sigma for repair."
4,Good value for my general purposes,"Added to my new Rebel T2i for general, non pro, picture taking. 18 to 200 very nice range. Zoom stiffens a little mid range but seems to be smoothing out with use. For the $$$ a no brainer and due to my inexperience with dslr (my pro gear all video) any lens shortcomings vs a more expensive version, do not bother me."
2,OS jitters very bad,"I purchased this as a lower cost alternative to the Sigma 18-250 for use on my Canon Xsi. Construction quality and optics seemed to be fine. The optical stabilization was something else completely. At anywhere past 1/2 zoom to full zoom, the OS caused the image in the viewfinder to jump very noticeably. I was using the lens for a lot of sports photography, so the zoom was very important. The jitters of the image at mid to high zoom were so bad I could not use the lens. Maybe I just got a defective lens asI had not seen any reviews noting this kind of issue previously. I have returned it and am rethinking whether to try the 18-250 as I had originally planned."
4,Sigma all-around lense,"So far images are very good, functionality is very good also. This is a good ""can take only one lense"" on a trip, etc. I will be using this at Disney World after Thanksgiving..."
5,Perfect walk around lens,"I love the performance. Best fits wedding shoots. As an amatuer, with one body, it lessen the time of changing lensen, unless very neccessary. for me i love it."
3,Good range but a little softer for my liking,"I had to return this. This lens was a little softer for my liking. Got some very good shots thou. At full zoom, the pictures are not as sharp as i would want them to be, but again, great for teh price!"
3,Very Disappointed,"I read review after review, did my research and was very excited to receive my Sigma 18-200 in the mail, but was very disappointed in the overall crispness of the images I took with my Canon EOS 40D.The lens feels solid and well made. I love the fact it has OS and a barrel lock. But as a a professional photographer who does a lot of indoor events, this lens did not work for me. This lens is slow. I specialize in candids and would lose many shots waiting for the AF to clue in. The image quality was sporadic and mostly soft.I have a Sigma wide angle 10-20 that I absolutely love, so this is nothing against Sigma. This lens may work great for someone who does a lot of outdoor photography, but it did not fit my needs."
4,A bargain superzoom lens,"Compared to Canon's superooms this a very inexpensive lens. The optical quality is really excellent, just a shade below the pair of Canon lenses it replaces. My only negative comments are minor: the zoom contols feels a little ""sticky"" in mid-range; the focus ring is too prominent and could lead to damaging the autofocusing motor. For a walk-around lens this is ideal -- not overly heavy, great zoom range, reasonably fast autofocus and effective image stabilization."
2,pointless with cats,"I tried this on our two cats, since neither one likes to be brushed with a normal brush. One bolted under the bed as soon as I turned on the Ionic Brush, the other one fidgeted but endured it with a little help from my wife.Problem: most cats don't actually stink, so the main purpose of this brush---deodorizing without a wet bath---is kind of lost on them. As far as detangling, reducing shedding and dander, it's not much better than a normal brush. Seems like just another person getting rich off of some clever advertising.Might be worth it on a stinky sweaty dog, though..."
1,Useless,"This brush is useless. The amount of air (ionized) it blows is minimal at best. Worse yet, the bristles are thin, short, and and easily breakable plastic. Save you money, and time. I can brush ""with the grain"" on my dog's coat, as a sign of affection with this brush, but there's no way I can actually even gently groom her with this product."
1,Don't buy this book,"...ok ...I've revised my review to not be so vehement...leave it at this... set aside the glamour and romantisism of ""the Japanese sword"" for a minute and really take a look at the guys in these pictures... do they really look competent? You decide... Other than that, there's no secrets being revealed here... it's not the Tokugawa period anymore... and you can't learn kenjutsu (or kendo, or boxing, or a foriegn language)a book..."
3,A book fit for swordsman and little else,"Well if you are familar with Yagyu Shinkage ryu already, and want a refesher, or detailed notes, this is the book for you. If you want to learn swordsmanship and have a limited background in Koryu style swordsmanship (im not talking about kendo background, or even Iaido) you will find this book with its lack of explantion, a difficult way to learn anything other than Shinkage ryu has a lot of forms.... This is not to say this is a bad book. Many in the ""world of koryu"" balk at even the idea of these forms being displayed let alone printed with any kind of detail. Not wishing to be harsh on this book's lack of user ""friendliness"" I will simply state that like the other books by this publisher (namely THE DIETY AND THE SWORD [KATORI SHINTO RYU]) they are good first efforts that hopefully will lead to more detailed, and hopefully better written instructional books in the future. -Vic"
1,Pretty good while it lasts....,"I purchased this model from a retail outlet about 8 months ago. In fact, I purchased two - one for myself and one as a gift. It really does a very good job of keeping beverages cold, and because of its small size, it's really handy. The bad news is that after the first 6 months, the motor got really loud... REALLY loud... and then died. I thought perhaps it was just mine, but the one I gave as a gift went through the same process and is now gone, as well. At these prices, I guess they're a disposable item, but they should really have lasted a bit longer than they did."
3,I thought this would be good for my office...,The features of this fridge are all good. Keeps food cold but can also warm things up! Only $80 thats a pretty good deal. But don't be fooled all; all that fits is a lunch bag and a bottle of pop. Anymore stuff and your out of luck. I always like to keep at least 3 kinds of soda on hand and maybe some cheese... you know a bunch stuff to nibble on throghout the day. If your like me. Look at the size of the fride before you buy it!
3,The book falls short of the claims made by the publisher...,"I bought this book mostly out of curiosity - what a Principle Consultant and DBA with Oracle Corporation may have to offer. While the book is decent in terms of technical contents, it falls way short of the BIG claims made by the publisher. Many scripts are just too simple to be production-strength utilities. New DBAs may find the book helpful in getting started, though."
3,NOT A WESTERN!!!,"Don't really know why this is sold as a western. Must be the town where it took place. It is a mystery through and through. People are being killed in the town of Clantick, Montana. All different kinds of people. So old, some young, a soldier, both men and women. There has to be a connection. Sheriff Ben Stillman and his deputy, Leon McMannigle try to figure it all out. It is left up to a woman to make the connection, then Ben knows who the killer is. Not bad for a mystery, real bad for a western. I was surprised at the end result. For a western writer Beandvold has done a flip flop."
4,Worked for a while,"This device worked for a while to keep my cat off of the car. After a while, I just got tired of putting it on the car every night."
4,What Do You Love?,"Ask a preschooler to plan a perfect summer day with mom. Jonathan London has created just such a day in, What Do You Love? Here a mother dog and her young puppy are personified as they hike out from their country home on a bright sunny morning to share the day together. The author's question, ""What do you love? is repeated throughout the text. Responses, given in both rhyme and rhythm, include ""park slides, and piggyback rides, mud pies and Mommy's eyes"". The bright watercolor illustrations are just as endearing as the text and they complement the story perfectly. Both young children and adults will enjoy reminiscing favorite childhood memories with loved ones as What Do You Love? is shared. M.J.L."
2,Bad quality.,"I had this knife for a short time. Within a few months, it completely disintegrated. It fell apart. All the screws came loose. I was left with a blade and the 2 pieces that made up the handle"
3,A Good Start,I am a great fan of Lucinda Williams. This collection shows her blues roots influence but it is also a very sophomoric effort. The music lacks depth not withstanding the good intentions. To see her perform these tunes now shows the miles she has traveled to bring this music alive in the deep old ways.
4,Customer Care,This is my first time and I am amaze about your services.I appreciate it and hope you will keep it up even improve it.
2,Too dense in a too small package,Some of the hardest and most complex circuits and schematics are not explained at all. Only the simplest things seem easy to understand. The author never demonstrates the equations or where they come from. The author assumes that the reader is a working engineer of technician that needs this book to remember the basics of communication electronics. Definitely not a recommended book to support an introductory course to communications.
4,Thanks Mr. Scoops!,"Taboo subjects aren't cutting it in comedy any more. They're slowly being eroded away by overuse and mere shock value. What truly shocks us any more? While Patton Oswalt deals with a number of taboos, he does it with an incomparable imagination and a faculty of language. This is what comedy needs in order to evolve.I bought this CD, returned it because it skipped like crazy, replaced it with a new one and it skips like crazy. That's why I'll only give it 4 stars."
4,"Great, just not as good as 222","This is a great album, but you're better off getting222 Live % Uncut. They're both from the same performance, but 222 is uncut so it has all the same bits plus soooooo much more."
1,Do NOT Read Positive Reviews,"This CD is the worst ""comedy"" CD I have ever heard. Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD. You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh. And it continues throughout the entire CD. There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all. It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.Don't believe me? Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews. Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem. Then make your decision to buy or not buy."
1,Ridiculous staging!,"The staging of this opera is ridiculous. The story is set in a party where the guests wear modern suits and dresses and drink prosecco... In the middle of it, an elevator brings Jochanaan, who is dressed like a beggar. Embarrassing, to say the least. When the staging is so bad, it is pointless to discuss the music. A CD would have been much better.People say that modern stagings are important to bring new audiences to the opera... I think that such a garbage can scare people off. Modern stagings should be creative, not just make fun of the opera."
1,A travesty to Strauss,The director must be joking. How can you take a biblical story and transport in to the 1930's? Herod in a three piece suit is ludicrous. And Salome is no young sex kitten and was an embarrassment she was so miscast and her dancing makes you laugh. Sorry could not finish this mess it was so disturbing. Looking forward to reviewing other versions.
3,Excess censorship,"This is an excellent DVD, but I feel a bit cheated.In the production at the Met. Salome strippedcompletely, if only momentarily, naked. The DVDhas seen fit to eliminate this short view of hernakedness.Dirty old man."
2,ok but the 2004 performance was better,"Mattila is showing her age and anyone who raves about this performance must not have heard many performances or recordings. It's ok but leaves something to be desired - aside from a decent staging. If you REALLY want to hear the power of this score, search out the 1949 Met broadcast with Welitsch under Reiner (on several labels but you may have to search Amazon.co.uk)."
4,Mattila shines in this role!,"Karita Mattila is the star in this production! Joseph Kaiser,also, sings and acts well-wish his role was a little larger. Good production."
5,the daughter of JEPHTE,"The word Oratorio might sound a preface to a 2-3 hours (often boring) saga.Well, not here.The two oratories in this CD, Jephte and Jonas by the wonderful Carissimi,are a nobly short works with an intelligent text and so lovely and charming music.Simply a honey to the heart.What makes this music to sound so beautiful and involving is the superb performance by the Consortium Carissimi under the direction of Vittorio Zanon.This is an excellent Italian ensemble, which concentrates on... Carissimi and his contemporaries - and indeed it's very hard to beat them in this field.The Soprano Nadia Caristi, as the daughter of Jephte, have one of the most beautiful and exciting voices i have ever heard,and her interpretation is a feast to the winds of the breast.The recording is top class,The linear notes are sufficiently informative,and the price is Naxos.MOST RECOMENDED."
5,its great!,"Like I said, its great. I put 20lbs in the vittle vault and its perfect, mind you I ordered the 30 pound soft store filled it with small chunks for toy dogs. You can't put much more than a 20lb bag in it . But I really like it being soft and portable with a handle."
5,MUST-HAVE for pet owners!,This product is FABULOUS! It keeps our dog food fresh for as long as it takes our 5lb. dog to go through her food (at least 6 month usually). And it collapses down as the food gets lower. I am an organization near-expert and this product is on my list of must-haves with a pet! It allows for great storage of dog food in a small space without attracting unwanted moisture or critters....and it looks nice! I'm buying one for my mom and brother now! :)
3,DOES NOT HOLD 30 POUNDS,"It is a very nice container, however, it does not hold 30 pounds of dry dog food. I use Nutro Natural Lite which is not a very big kibble & it only held about 2/3 of the 30lb bag."
2,Heist is a waste of time and money,My husband and I hadn't been to a movie in ages and decided this movie looked interesting. Wrong. The twists were confusing and the plot and the charactors were poorly written. We left in the middle of the movie. We thought the scene where the pilots were abducted was in poor taste after what happened Sept. 11. Gene Hackman looked too old to be playing a con man.
1,Severely lacking,"The Heist has a slow moving storyline that keeps the audience wondering when it's going to end. The characters for the most part are poorly developed and lack the cohesion necessary for a good film. The one aspect of this movie that could have pulled it out was the twists and turns when trying to figure out where the gold is, but unfortunately it's not quite enough to hold things together. Wait for the T.V. premier for this one."
1,For the David Mamet devotee only,I had forgotten that this was a Mamet work until the stilted dialogue and theatrical staging reminded me of other films by him. The viewer can see everyone acting. Hackman is better than his material here. Implausible triple crosses.
1,just not good,this movie sucks. ending is predictable. the line about being as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton was ALMOST good. Reservoir Dogs--now there's a heist film!
1,Not Good At All,"This movie was not good at all. It was completly boring.I went into the theater thinking i would love it because i really like Gene Hackman, and Danny Devito, but the cast did not help.It was so boring, that i fell asleep, and i have never fallen asleep during a movie ever in my life.I cant remember one second during that movie, that I was being entertained.If you want to be entertained, go rent Memento.Dont waste your time with this movie."
5,Gene Hackman at his best in a,"taught, clever and never dull thriller about a series of robberies staged brilliantly by David Mamet. Aces all the way. Hang on till the last 10 seconds or you won't understand the entire film. Who's good, who's bad and who's on who's side?"
5,top notch behind the scenes,when you look at this movie some of the best work is off camera with great camera shots writing and premises. i wish to have seen more a de vito in teh movies but all around great diaglouge and acting hackman gave a great performance with his old school style all around great flick
4,One Turn After Another,"A very good movie with many big names that presented one twist after another. By the end of it, you know another twist os coming, you just don't know where from. You can sense it and you have ideas but you don't know for sure. It only gets 4 stars since you can sense the twists, not totally unexpected. But still very good.It is a movie about a heist (obviously) and bad guys and badder guys, no good guys here. Double crossing and triple crossing and double crossing again. Other reviews have layed out the names and plot so I have narrowed my review to a very general view. But this movie should be watched, it is very entertaining. Lots of violence and swearing but no bed scenes. Not as good as the movie Heat, about the same type of ""crew"" but still very good."
3,Dialogue as Lame as a Bucketful of Ants,"Mamet's movies are usually pretty dialogue-heavy, full of twists and turns, and fairly macho. Heist was all of that, but I still came away disappointed.The dialogue was awkward and contrived at times, with klunkers like ""quiet as an ant pissing on cotton"" and ""cute as a bucket full of kittens."" All right already with the lame similes. The relationships were almost believable, until the end. I'm afraid the end was not believable, nor was it satisfying.I guess I thought this would be an Ocean's 11 sort of caper, but it was a little grittier than that, with all of the plot contortions, but none of the charm. It is not the sort of movie you would walk out on, but Mamet has done better. Try State and Main instead."
3,2 1/2 stars really,"this movie is full of twists. that can be a good thing, but in this film, its just one twist, back and forth.the good guys dupe the bad guys.. then the bad guys have the upper hand.. then, wow.. the good guys are back on top.. but wait.. what's that? the bad guys pull ahead in a surprising move.. but the good guys still have an ace up their sleeve..this back and forth leaves the ""surprise"" ending little more than something you're simply waiting on the movie to reveal.anyway.. this film does have some good things going for it. the first scene is a very tight and solid scene. the action sequences are very realistic.. and the directing is just right, and resists the urge to go to over the top. (if only Mamet had that sensibility when writing the script).. the acting is great.. especially from Hackman, Lindo, and Pidgeon.i suggest you rent this movie.. its definately worth a look.. just don't expect anything too terribly challenging."
1,Just Another Heist Movie,"""Heist"" is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a ""who fools who?"" picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid."
3,And the winner is ... not Mamet!,"Mamet pieces seem invariably static, talky; working overly hard to be clever and pithy and spinning in tight little circles. None of this makes for good film-making. However, when you introduce Gene Hackman into any mix (but especially this one) and add Delroy Lindo, you've got something very watchable--if not plot-holed and implausible. This is the Hackman-Lindo show and worth watching if only two see two consummate actors breathe life into what, in any other hands, would have been a major yawn.Hackman's been in some bad movies but he never, ever turns in a bad performance. And Delroy Lindo is (like Morgan Freeman, among others) an actor who deserves more credit than he gets. He, too, invariably invests his characters with considerable weight--rendering them entirely believable.So ignore the story-line in this one. It'll drive you nuts. But see it for the two fine actors who bring life to an otherwise listless and unbelievable script."
1,I WISH THERE WAS A ZERO STAR,"Ill start out by saying im a hackman fan, but wow he must have owed someone a favor for this movie. I think a chimp could have wrote a better screenplay. I've never heard so many cheesy cliches in my life. ""She's as cute as a chinese baby"" what the hell is that!!!! This movie is bad from beginning to finish....TOP 10 worst movie ever made!!!!"
1,Superfluous racial epithets ruin any movie.,"As a suspense movie, I guess it was mildly entertaining: it had the criminals we applaud and the plot turns we hope for, sort of, but I can't understand, especially in today's culture, how Mamet (who knows a little something about racism) would think it witty to incorporate lines like ""as long as a chinaman's name"" or ""cute as a Chinese baby"" (when referring to something clearly NOT cute) into the already flimsy script. If you have to resort to lines like that, perhaps it's time to hang it up."
1,Dreck,Rebecca Pidgeon? Involved with a project like this disgusting movie? Her father used to teach at MIT. I feel sorry for his disappointment.
4,Gene Hackman is so awesome!,"This is just another typical ""Heist"" film. but Hackman really shines in it. He brought my review up with his acting! He is just such a great actor.Plus, it's a Mamet project, and I am weary of his films. I've been disappointed in the past. ""spanish prisoner"" was just so awful! i remember hating that movie. Mamet has hit and misses, and heist is more of a hit. certainly one of the better films of 2001.There were some great lines in the film and the acting was decent. The ending was a surprise."
4,The Heist,"I chose this rating because I have been looking for this movie for a while. I couldn't remember how it ended and I finally found the video and got to see the movie. If you like some suspence, rent or buy The Heist. Gene Hackman does a good job. Mom would enjoy this movie."
3,Typical Heist Genre.,"While some of the plots twists were predictable, the flow kept my interest, and I did not fall asleep, which is my most important parameter when watching a DVD late at night."
3,You'll Like It If You Like Gene Hackman,"It's a classic heist and con plot, but I didn't care for it. The intricacies of the heist and all the double-crossing are too complicated. Gene Hackman never impressed me. He can't act to save his life, and he has no film presence; even though, I know this flies in the face of the opinions of about 100 million other people."
4,Intriguing movie about thieves,"Heist is a movie about old-time stealers. It's about guys who perform high-level thefts. At the beginning of the movie, we witness a heist that involves jewelry. It's all very complicated and the thieves must be very ingenious.The leader of the thieves is Joe, who gets a great job with a short man played by Danny DeVito. What happens next is a great storyline with many spins and changes. You never know what's going to happen next, and the ending is quite dramatic. This movie also has very clever dialogue."
1,Awful,"I'm told (and some of the reviews below would seem to confirm it) that David Mamet is highly rated as a scriptwriter. Strange, as the dialogue throughout this terrible movie is some of the worst I can remember. These are the most flacid 'tough guy' scenes to come out of the supposed home of this stuff in a long time, and humourous it is not. The acting is ordinary, the plot convoluted and cliched, and Mamet's much-vaunted 'style', in this film at any rate, adds up to a long string of shots that reminded me, eerily, of The A-team and Knight-rider..."
1,Sorry David - Its one of the worst....,"Without going into an unnecessarily verbose explanation, this is quite simply one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The plot is twisted to the point of silliness, the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic and the casting is questionable (people kept laughing at Danny De Vito's character - and he wasn't being funny!). The action packed shootem-up climax at the harbour had the whole cinema laughing it was so ridiculous and the ending brought applause for the fact we could all go home. Enough said."
2,The real HEIST was when they got my 5.25 for the matinee,"Maybe I expected too much from this movie when I saw the list of stars (who I thought did a good job overall - I really liked Pinky), but I thought this movie just drug on and on and wouldn't stop. The story was just not that interesting or innovative. There's millions of movies out just like it with some old experienced thief - blah blah blah. I think they could have made this movie about half as long. It probably would have been better, and my knees wouldn't have gotten stiff.I'd say if you have to see it, wait for it on video (if you have spare change). Or even better, cable."
2,Big Disappointment,Gene Hackman + Danny DeVito + Delroy Lindo - What more could you ask for?? I guess a bit more - Very limited action - too many plots and changes which were not needed - talked about the reason Hackman was doing one more score but never really used it as part of the plot - ending was not even close to being a surprise - should have ended with the boat cruise and never stopped at the dock. All attempts at using DeVito's comedy style just did not fit the movie.
1,David Mamet's worst film,"I'm a huge David Mamet fan, but this film is unwatchable. Mostly because of Gene Hackman's god awful performance."
1,Pants,"It is always disappointing to see good actors in poor films, you would think by now Gene Hackman could be more selective of his scripts.The Heist has a mandatory 'twist' every 10 minutes most of which have no bearing on the film and are rarely clever, they just end up making the writer look silly. The final twist is a joke, I found myslef laughing out loud at this film and having to remind myself that it is intended to be a straight crime thriller not a comedy."
1,Movie [was bad],This is a good movie if you like slow movies. The action does not really get intense and enjoyable until almost the end. The beginning is boring and not entertaining.My best advice - Rent it before you buy it and if you like it buy it.
2,Disappointing,"If you think, like me, that David Mamet is a brilliant writer, you're bound to be disappointed by Heist. This is a decidedly minor work in the screenwriter/director's career. It has some good lines (""Everyone needs money. That's why they call it money"") and a fine cast, but it seems contrived and even fake. Mamet can certainly do better than this."
3,Decent film; not one of Mamet's best,"Gene Hackman plays an old thief who is coerced by another crook (played by Danny DeVito) to take on a high-risk heist. The plot cannot be captured in a few lines; it's got a lot of twists... a lot of people double-crossing each other.It's great to see Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito get in each other's faces. However, the movie is not far above the average heist film. It's got some great moments of dialogue (""Don't you want to hear my last words?"" ""I just did.""), and it's got a lot of attitude and intense performances. But the flashy dialogue can also be forced, and you as the viewer feel pointlessly led around by a rope rather than really absorbed in the film. I also managed to predict what the next twist would be nearly every time.The movie's worth watching if you're a fan of Mamet, Hackman and/or DeVito. You could find worst films out there; it's o.k., not great."
3,A Few Good Scenes And Dialogue...,"...But overall this is a clunker mainly due to Mamet's slow pacing. Hackman gives one of his best performances and Delroy Lindo is excellent in a supporting role. I also enjoyed Ricky Jay a whole lot but he is always good (i.e. Boogie Nights, narrator of Magnolia). The major problem with this film is that the pacing is much too slow for a film of this type. A ""heist"" flick should not simply plod along from scene to scene. I was also surprised at how boringly photographed the film was considering it was shot by PTA's DP Robert Elswit who I think also shot one of the recent Bond films so there is absolutely no excuse for this film to feel slow at any time."
2,I was robbed!,"I expected a Mamet film with Gene Hackman to be at least entertaining, but NO! Lots of strained dialogue, bad casting in several roles, and an overly complex plot that lost my interest halfway through resulted in a waste of money. Maybe on pay-per-view but not worth a DVD."
3,Heist,"Heist is an O.K. movie but a bit boring and long and too many double-crosses that makes it seem to unbelievable even for a movie, but hey I rented it and watched it and it's okay. Rent it first."
2,just okay,"Hackman's acting is just not good. I know Hackman fans will hate me for this, but I don't like it at all. The plot is alright and the other actors are good, but I don't recommend it as a movie to run out and see. The method of the robbery itself was good, and original, but that's all there was besides the sexy Rebecca Pidgeon, I thought."
2,Could have been so much better,"With the cast this movie had I was expecting much more. The acting isn't bad, it's the story that I didn't like. The movie seemed to drag on slowly forever and then never seemed to end. See ...it is much better in my opinion."
2,"They weren't kidding when they said ""for dummies""","I didn't find this book helpful at all. It just barely skims the surface, and usually concludes with ""make sure you talk to your accountant/attorney/estate planner."" If I intended to talk to all those folks, I wouldn't waste my time reading this book in the first place. Most of what this book covers could be learned by snooping around the web - and in many cases you can learn more that way. It defines the terminology, but even that is often inadequate. I suggest you check this book out from the local library, and then if you find it to be a useful resource go ahead and buy it. I wish I had done that - I don't feel this book has enough information to really qualify as a reference book."
3,Pretty Good,Pretty good reference on types of pumps made but little info or detail about them. Not much help for restoration work but does help when buying pumps by phone. Pictures of restored pumps would have been a big plus.
5,Just What He Wanted,"I ordered this for my DH since he has an antique gas pump that he is restoring. This book is just what he wanted and he is using it for reference. Good price, and it shipped quickly. I love easy ordering from Amazon."
5,An Illustrated Guide to Gas Pumps: Identification and Price Guide,The book was done very well. It was a great help to me in getting started in the collecting of Gas Pumps.
3,Kindle not good for reffrence books,Although the information is good I find it close to useless on the Kindle format.I find it close to impossible to search or scan. I should have gotten a hard copy.
4,It is a good way to start teaching time,"As soon as my boy told me that he wanted to have his own alarm clock, since he saw that I have one, and it wakes us up everyday. I went looking for one over the internet. I got this one because it had a radio, and a night light with it. And for the price it was better than other ones that I was looking at. The night light has just an on/off button, so there is no way of adjusting the brightness. The radio reception is good but not great. I guess I can't complain too much about that since wanted a clock not a radio. The radio is nice but just not all that clear. All in all it is making my child exited to wake up in the morning, he can tell time much more better than before."
4,Nice first clock radio,"I bought this product because of its combination clock, radio, and nightlight. It is very easy to use for young children and seems to be a good product. We are happy with our purchase!"
5,A full exposition on Heidegger,"This book contains a detailed study on Heidegger's works, the different stages of his thought. The philosopher himself wrote the introduction to this very complete treatise."
4,This book helped during a very difficult time,"I read this book during the recent hospitalization and subsequent passing of my wife. In the course of dealing with death and dying, I experienced what I would call a spiritual awakening. This book helped provide a context for some of what I was experiencing and was actually a source of incredible comfort. I'm in the process of re-reading this book now & again find it helpful and affirming for the spiritual path I now find myself to be on."
4,Meditation,Insightful book which does an excellent job of teaching spiritual optimism. I particularly enjoyed the chaper on meditation and the mind. Book also contains an excellent resource list as well.
4,Imperfect but still useful spiritual guide.,"Much of what J. Borysenko writes is, for me, too ""out there"" to be accessible (e.g., her chapter on past lives). However, much of what is written here is also extraordinarily helpful to those of us seeking practical steps toward creating a more compassionate relationship with ourselves and with others. If you can read this book with a view to skipping over the more fantastic claims and discussions, then I suspect you will find some profoundly excellent guidance."
5,An important book for any spiritual counselor,"Fire in the Soul reveals how the hardest thing you have ever experienced can actually be a doorway for your soul to step into its greatness. It is an eye opener showing us how the bad choices we make actually influence us to make future bad choices by setting up a chemical imbalance in our brains. We actually become addicted to the chemical high of that bad choice, thereby, repeating the behavior over and over again. The wonderful thing about this book is it reveals that the misunderstandings we have come to accept with past erroneous choices can be corrected through transpersonal psychology and spiritual awareness of ""the Self"". The negative events that shape us from childhood can be challenged and transformed in adulthood through an innate desire to improve one's outlook on life. This is the literal interpretation of that old saying, ""change your thoughts and change your reality"" but with instructions you can actually use in your day to day life."
3,"Good looking, comfy jeans...run big!",I think these are very good jeans...but they run big! The size six fits more like an eight. I would exchange for a four but paying for shipping returns...I will just wear them baggy!
2,"Good, but short","I like these jeans, but they are short. I have the same jeans bought 1 year ago, and they are longer, If you are an ""almost tall"" these would not be the pair for you.The fit around the waist is good and the color is good."
3,panned but well planned,"Wire's IBTABA album was panned by the critics, but it's worth a listen.These songs were recorded at concerts in Chicago and Portugal, then taken into the studio and reworked. Some of the tunes, such as ""Finest Drops,"" can be found on earlier WIRE albums. Finest Drops, for example, is MUCH better on the IBTABA album than it was on ""A Bell is a Cup Until it is Struck.""Only the track ""Illuminated"" is a poor cut, and it's so bad that it's embarrassing. Other than that, ""Finest Drops"" and the excellent ""German Shepherds"" stand out as fine work."
2,Lacking dissonance for want of what??,"A strange concept - to release an album of previously released material that is 'based on' live shows. Although their cloak of mystery and craft seems apparent, the songs suffer from relative mediocrity. Most versions are better in other incarnations, but you can get the single version of ""Eardrum Buzz"" here, which is mandatory. ""In Vivo"" should have been a hit single worldwide and ""Illuminated"" is years ahead of its time. The version of ""Over Theirs"" is quite inferior to the one on ""The Ideal Copy"" (in fact, I think I'll have to play that one now) and overall this album is a showcase of their knack for reworking the same song into other realms (which has been done better on ep's and live bonus cuts) but not very convincing. A bland attempt at being palatable for an audience that turned a deaf ear. I'll stick with the ambitious stuff, thank you."
5,Amazing,"This CD is great even if you are not a Wire fan. This was the 2nd Wire recording I ever purchased, although now I own a lot, and it is just really interesting, especially with earphones. Get it."
2,Deadened weight,"Rustic Canterbury with some decently arranged ideas but little compelling chemistry to keep it all in motion, instead emanating artsy, flat folk."
3,"Interesting, light reading","This book is not authoritative but rather anecdotal in presentation. The author does not present herself as an avian expert, but does provide some good, ""readable"" information in a easy going format. It is comprehensive, and DOES cover a wide range of species. True, the author's Grey, Sinbad, is mentioned and shown throughout the book, but other species do recieve her attention. She recommends nuts and bolts for toys, but fails to mention that they must be free of zinc. (Stainless steel for example). I would not rely upon this book as my primary source of information, but rather as supplemental to other more authoritative texts written by avian experts."
5,One of the Best Parrot Books Available!,"Julie covers everything a bird owner needs to know in this book, from behavior of the bird in the wild, to behavior as a pet. As a bird breeder of many years, this is the book I recommend to most bird owners, or potential bird owners, as one they need to read. BUY IT! You won't be sorry!"
5,Why does my bird do that,This is a great book that gives a lot of information as to why birds act and do what they do. It helps you to understand your bird and birds behavior in depth. I would recommend this book to anyone who has birds or who is thinking about getting a bird!
2,Disappointing,"Although my son thought he wanted this, he was quite bored with it and sits on the shelf and he never watches it. It's just as well, since it is more adult that we thought and not appropriate."
1,What????,"I guess most people buying the DVD love the show but I had never seen the show and bought the first season for curiosity. Out of all the adult swim shows I have seen (robot chicken, aqua teen, metalocalypse, boondocks) this one was undeniably boring and uninteresting. Most of the time Harvey represents cartoon characters that are from the 70s, to whom I have no clue who they are. You might like it if your an older person."
5,too good to be true.,"Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law is one of the funniest and most refreshing shows to come out of the incredible line-up of Adult Swim shows. The show's creators, Ouweleen and Richter, obviously have connections with Hanna-Barbera and have access to all of the characters from the shows of the 60's and 70's. They mix these characters with crude, witty, sarcastic, and debaucherous humor. What you get is pure hilarity, brought to you by such great voices as Gary Cole, Stephen Colbert, and John Michael Higgins.Throughout each episode the show seem to become more refined and more hilarious. One of the best cartoon shows I have ever seen in my life. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the incredibly eccentric and radiant shows that are constantly on Adult Swim, this show being my personal favorite.The DVD has plenty of enjoyable extras that will keep you entertained, and will give you a burning desire for Volume 2 to come out as soon as possible. I know I'll be waiting."
3,"Good, not great","Harvey Birdman is funny, sometimes its hilarious, sometimes its barely a giggle. most of the funnier episodes dont happen until late into the 2nd disk, but its still worth the purchase to get your Birdman fix until Adult Swim gets their own network"
5,Excellent Cartoon - Required for Hanna Barbera Fans,"Great cartoons, and the perfect parodies of the old Hanna Barbera cartoonsIf you're an old cartoon fan, you're gonna love these updated parodies ----- especially the integration of so many funny innuendoes, that we have all reflected upon at one point in our lives..."
5,Excellent and funny,"Anyone who is over 30 and remembers Hanna Barbera cartoons from our youth will love this. Basically, it is the absurd: 70's b-list cartoon characters in a law firm. Two genius episodes stand out: the Unaboo (boob boo bear as the unabomer) and the Flintstones as the Sopranos. Brilliant! Watching the 15 minute long episodes back to back on DVD is the way to go."
5,Excellent service for a hard-to-find item,"Product arrived on time and in specified condition. I purchased this product as part of a free shipping deal that Amazon was running during the 2009 holiday season. I can never seem to find this series in stores when I'm looking for it, but Amazon always has plently in stock! This was a Christmas gift that really made the recipient's day."
5,Poetic mastery,"Gitanjali, the author of this collection of poems never revealed her writings to public view. It was only after her death at the age of 18 that these peoms were ""discovered"". Close friends and relatives knew about her poetic soft nature but never came to know that she actually was writing poems.These poems stunned entire literary world and everyone who reads this book will agree that nature has taken away from our midst what could have become a legendary poet."
2,Waterless bath?,this brush doesn't make too much for my dog. it has two little holes where a very soft hair (which smells like plastic) comes from. In the box says i should brush him every day for 5 minutes but yesterday i found a flea on his coat and he still smells.... The only good thing is that my dog likes the massage.
4,Addictive,"I began listening to Bollywood music after becoming addicted to Bollywood movies. I am now addicted to the music. I don't know if it's good or bad and have no sophisticated judgments to offer, but I can't stop listening to this CD."
2,Waiting for First Who,"I have waited a long time for the first Album by The Who to be released and given the full treatment the rest of thier catalog was given. This addition of thier first album has been remixed for stereo and in most cases sounds poor. Roger's voice on a couple of tracks sounds muffled. The albums classic title track was remixed so much that it bares little resemblance to the version we all know and love (which can be found on the bonus disc). I have been a Who fan for the past 23 years and can recognise some subtle differences in some of the past remasters, but even a Who novice could tell in one listen that there's something wrong with this edition. The only bonus to this CD is some unreleased material and the the wonderful liner notes. Buy this as an interesting addition, but don't consider this as the definitive addition of this first album."
5,"WHO FANS,THIS IS THE MONO VERSION!","All the past reviews are of others editions,THIS CD import of My Generation 2012 IS the original and beatiful 1965 MONO MASTER, the sound is perfect and the presentation good, so who fans and audiophiles, BUY IT! highly recommended!"
3,standard album with cool sleeve,"This is just the standard version of my Generation with the japanese sleeve. Always a good album with the Who occaisonly trying to find their feet. Check out ""the ""ox"", surely one of the most powerful things the the Who ever recorded."
3,Not Quite Prime Time,"Whereas this expanded version of the Who's debut release has several interesting songs, the overall effort falls short of prime time material by this band. I've always like The Kids Are Allright and A Legal Matter and My Generation are cool tunes. Some other stand out album tracks include Instant Party Mix, Daddy Rolling Stone, Anywhere I Choose, and The Good's Gone.However, many of these songs are a bit underdeveloped melodywise. Good drumming yes, but mixed feelings towards the guitar parts. Oh the rhythm toucehs are very good. However, the solos are pretty forgettable for the most part. And Roger Daltrey's voice has not fully developed. His voice has not reached full power. Can anyone say Who's Next or Quadrophenia.Nonetheless, this is a good but not great collection."
1,"Bad mix, bad edit on LA-LA-LA LIES","For MCA to charge this much money for two (under 50 minutes each)cds that contain an HORRIBLE SPLICING job on the LA-LA-LA LIES on disc 1, and you can barely hear the guitar on the ""stereo"" version of title song is why people rather borrow cds from friends that waste hard earned money on scams like this cd."
2,Contains a few good songs....,"I didn't mind the remastering too much but even including the bonus disc of extra stuff, this album still only has like 3 good songs and the rest are just....ok. Great single from this album but nothing worth it."
4,BASIC ROCK ENERGY,"At last, hearing the Who's first long player is a real treat. Myviny album was mono, heavily scratched, and barely listenableafter all these years. the music here is wonderful, at least, most of it is...my only gripe is, they could've fit all the goodtunes onto one disc, instead of stretching the material out totwo discs. there's definitely some filler here. the first discis great, and there are a couple tunes from the second which areworth having, but not all. good booklet, too."
2,not great 2/5,"i must say i'm a huge who fan my favorite albums are ""who by numbers"" and""who's next"" but this ""my generation"" i bought the re-issue of the vinyl for 20 and it's my first time i've listened too this album and if fact i'm sorely disapointed it's a throwaway album at best..the only highlights are ""my generation"" ""kids are alright"" ""legal matter"" ""the ox""they hadn't mastered the makings of a great album yet give them till ""a quick one"" now that's a masterpiece this and i'm ashamed to say it is a poor excuse of an album..not the who i love..a band getting it together with only a couple high..."
1,We Won't Get Fooled Again,"Here's yet another incomplete, rehash of The Who's back catalog in the guise of the new ""Deluxe Edition"" series. The fact is that there is nothing new here at all except alternate version of a few tracks. As others have stated, the dynamic range has been expanded but the mixes are incomplete. Gone are Daltrey's vocal and various instrumental overdubs. Also missing are the other songs recorded at the same time like ""Just You And Me Darling"".Still gone from the current catalog are: ""Goin' Down"", ""Dogs"", ""Dogs, Part 2"", ""Waspman"", ""Here 'Tis"", ""Here For More"", ""Zoot Suit"", ""Under My Thumb"", ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"", ""When I Was A Boy"", etc. After waiting so long for this reissue, this is a big letdown.MCA should stop procrastinating and release a complete boxed set of The Who's studio recordings. They should also release entire concerts from 1973 (Quadrophenia tour) and 1982 (It's Hard tour).[DW]"
3,"Deluxe edition, but not DEFINITIVE","To call this the ORIGINAL ALBUM, as Disc One is titled, is misleading. How can it be when the guitar solo for ""My Generation"" is missing? Or the French Horn on ""Circles""? This is an ALTERNATE version (kind of like the alternate version on the Deluxe Edition of Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On""). It's something interesting to hear once, but not over and over.What's really a crime is that both discs total just over 91 minutes, which means there was PLENTY of extra time to put the ORIGINAL mono version in a nice, clean, remastered form.On the plus side, no one has mentioned how good ""I Can't Explain"" sounds. Without the annoying tambourine overdub, Keith Moon's drums sound like bullets being fired from a machine gun.I compare this to the Beatles Anthologys or other rarities collections: nice for a fresh look at old songs. But, if I want to hear ""My Generation"", I'll go back to my old unremastered original version."
2,Vacuum sealer container,"Not too good. The containers seem to develop cracks along the bottom and then leak. The manufacturer has been OK about replacing them, but this is a real defect!!!"
1,not durable,"I have had three of the 3.25-quart canisters. All have developed cracks in the bottom, losing the ability to seal. They were infinitely useful before the cracks developed. I have the medium sized and smaller sized canisters as well. They are holding up much better.Save your money. Buy the smaller canisters. They don't hold as much, but seem to last longer."
1,Cracked!,"I was storing some left over cereal in this and as I turned on the machine to remove the air, the bottom of the canister cracked. Ugh!"
1,"Definitely, not what it is cracked up to be","Basically, the FOODSAVER system is sound and well designed EXCEPT for the canisters which often crack. Many of us have urged Tilia to upgrade the plastic canisters, and so far they have refused. I do not put the canisters in the dishwasher, or even use harsh chemicals. One canister cracked, pressurized, on the shelf after a few weeks without being moved. When you call Tilia they will let you know that there is NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on their canisters, which tells volumes about how they view their own product.Tilia blames their customers for the cracks. I am honestly sorry I did not heed the warnings I read by Amazon consumers before I purchased. I usually depend on Amazon customer recommendations for all my purchases. I have spent much money on Tilia accessories, and am now considering looking for another brand. Hope this helps, Ron"
4,Love Food Saver,"Food Saver is a terrific product. Keeping things fresh is easy. I always keep my coffee in one, as well as items like rice and cereal."
2,Great until it starting cracking,Very disappointed in Food Saver's Canisters. I've had this canister for just over 5 months and stress cracks are appearing in the bottom.
1,foodsaver canister,twice I have recieved canisters that after the first vacume have cracked along the bottom center seal and would not hold a vacume. I have repaired this leak with glue but feel the canister is not well made.
1,not cracked up to be as good as they say,"did not even make it one month, dec 2006 bought by jan 3 one cracked , went to get out second one it was cracked a week later , bought them for my coffee beans. what a waste , sad thing they know they have the problem they told me when i called.maybe they should have a recall ,call and complain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Product,"3.5 canister is most usful. Can combine several items, in separate plastic bags, in the one large canister. Since none of the canisters stack because of the domed lid, I find the larger and taller canister, with almost the same footprint as the smaller, does more for me."
1,Sure as the sun rises...,"..these are cracking too. What is Foodsaver's problem? This cracking of their product, which is clearly defective, has been going on for several years. HELLO???"
2,Cracked bottom,"We use the canisters to keep cereal, crackers, and dry snacks fresh. However, 3 of the canisters cracked at the bottom after about 6 mos use. We only hand wash these canisters. I called Food Savers and they said there's no warranty on these canisters. But since we purchased them less than a year ago, they're willing to replace them for us even though the CSR couldn't find the exact sizes we have from their product list. But at least they tried!"
2,Problems with cracking,I really do like these containers. I have about three dozen of them and I have had problems with this size cracking on the bottoms due to the extreme pressure of the suction. (I have never dropped them or washed then in the dishwasher. I hope they can improve on the design.
4,Kerve,"I keep all my humidity sensitive food products (chips, bagels, dry cereal) in these containers. Their useable lives are extended. Don't drop or they will crack and leak. They still are useable for storage."
3,like the sealing but the side of the canister cracked after 3 uses,The side of the canister cracked after the third use. The crack doesn't appear to go all the way through so I guess it's still usable.FoodSaver 3.25-Quart Designer Canister
4,A Different Little Red Riding Hood,"This Little Red Riding Hood story was really different than the other stories about Litle Red Riding Hood I have read. Most of them just tell about how she goes into the woods and meets the wolf and all, but this talked about how she got her red hood and how she went into town and all. I kind of liked the extra details because it helped me to visualize the story better in my head, but it just made the story longer."
5,"""It's Time to Duel!!!""","THIS IS MY FAVORITE YU-GI-OH!TOY.IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE YAMI YUGI.WHEN YOU TWIST HIS WAIST,HE DOES A BORING DUEL FEATURE.THE MONSTER GRAB GAME IS FUN.MY BROTHER & I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.IT'S LIKE A MEMORY GAME.WE EVEN PLAY GO FISH WITH THEM.I ALSO HAVE THE SUMMUNED SKULL TOY.PEACE OUT!!!"
