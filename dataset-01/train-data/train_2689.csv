4,Out of Print!?,"Madness! This album was a smash and went 4x platinum and spawned two #1 hits. Sure, Tiffany isn't exactly churning out the hits anymore, but it's an 80's pop classic. Everyone remembers the big songs like ""I Think We're Alone"" and the gorgeous ballad ""Could've Been."" ""I Saw Him Standing There"" was a big hit too going top 10. I also really enjoy ""Danny."" I'm surprised it wasn't a hit. Tiffany was definitely overlooked. She could've been right up there with the divas of today. She definitely had the pipes. Unfortunately, she couldn't shake the teen pop image and the trouble with her family life. A great pop album. I also recommend anything by Debbie Gibson."
4,Kicks ... !!,This band is awsome because the drummer comes from my hometown. The music is crazy. They're a really good band and i wouldn't be suprised to see them headline in ozzfest a few years down the road.
4,"Wet Aussie Stuff: ""Wolf Creek"" to Remember!","I had been to their concert where old fellows possessed really an art tool place rather than an object of ill interests for too many spectators.DVD is much better than performance as it is sexier by allowing the comprehending of all aspects impressive manhood might present.Good advertisement for luring foreigners to Australia but should be seen in conjunction and a trip must be considered with ""Wolf Creek""."
2,BE CAREFUL,"This adapter, as I have learned, comes in a newer format that older outlets can NOT handle (containing four extra pins). This means that this product was useless to me.I'm not bashing the product itself, but the vagueness of the description as not to mention this issue was annoying. Long story short, I'm returning this."
4,excelente construccion pero no funciona,"el adaptador esta muy bien cosntruido, se siente solido, y los ""switch"" son muy faciles de utilizar perocomo muchos mencionan en las reviews el adaptador solo funciona en tarjetas de video especificas de atisi no me equivoco la serie radeon 9xxxtengo un televisor lg que no trae hdmi y antes cambiar la mi trajeta hd 4770 por un modelo nuevo queria probar si tendria la opcion de usar mi tv... despues de conectarlo y probar diferentes configuracines logre se√±al en mi tv, dicha opcion fue configurar la salida como monitor crt en el ati catalist y en la propiedades de pantalla de windows bajar la tasa de refresco a 29 hz, aun asiel color sale distorcionado totalmente... basicamente la pantalla se ve rojaes una pena ya que la idea parace muy simple y funcional, pero por el precio $3 valia la pena hacer el intento"
2,Inadequently Represented,"This product did arrive in good condition, for that I will award two stars.This product represents little information of what it does. I believe it only works with DVI signals having TV-Out.With my component television, the display has inaccurate colors (white is purple), no resolution setting (from 620x480-1280x1024) on many different hZ frequences solved the problem.This product is not intended for a normal video card (as in my Macbook Pro- which works great by the way)"
3,DOES NOT convert component to DVI,"I made an error in buying this; I thought it might work to convert component signal to DVI. The seller did not specify (although I probably should have realized) that it only converts DVI to component, not the other way around.Luckily, it is not very expensive, so I did not waste very much money. But it was disappointing to discover that I did not have the converter I thought I did."
4,Good Effort,"Fuel had the kind of sound that you could compare to those old grunge bands like the Smashing Pumpkins, Sound Garden or even Pearl Jam.. Brett Scallions just brings that ""post-grunge"" edge to the band.. However, I was pleased to find Fuel experimenting with their style on this album.. It was evident right from the radio single, ""Fall On Me"", a melodic hard rock song..There is a much harder bass on this CD, and for anyone who heard ""Won't Back Down"" off the Daredevil Soundtrack, you can expect much of a similar sound.. No more ""Shimmer"", no more ""Bad Day"", just hard riffs and strong vocals..Standout Songs:""Falls On Me""""Million Miles"" (My personal favorite)""Won't Back Down""""Running Away""""Most Of All""""Getting Thru?""Worth the money, I'd recommend it to anyone who loves hard rock or grunge"
5,FUEL CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME!!!!!,"I have been a huge fan for quite a while now. This album surprised me little bit with the subtle change in their style. I loved the album the first time I heard it. Some songs immediately blew me away, such as ""Quarter,"" ""Most of All,"" ""Falls on Me,"" ""Running Away,"" ""Miles Away,"" ""Die Like This."" The whole CD is really great, though. If you can, I would advise seeing them live so you can really get the full effect of just how talented they are as musicians."
5,this cd is awesome,"this is a great cd honestlyone of their best, it was hard to topsunburn but this is close,while being a much darker indy sound,the most recent fuel album offers a freshmix of less friendly radio tracks and morepassionate ballads including the first(falls on me), natural selection includesa greater variety of emotions including thefirst ever piano track by carl bell who wrotethe words and music to nearly ever song,over all the cd is amazing, a breathe of fresh airfrom the all to occuring recent trend of pop rockFuels latest cd proves to be a masterpiece of indy rockthat is sure to not let their fans down"
3,just what i expected only a little left of center,"fuel has basically come to be expected to produce a catchy,semi mellow rock single to give an appetizer to a slee modern rock album.they succeed here, as ""falls on me"" is the most bland single they have released to date.""quarter"" goes back to the roots of fuel, with some catchy and choppy guitars while ""million miles"" and ""down inside of you"" sound like two tracks that could have been bsides from ""something like human"".""wont back down"" is the technology tinged ""heavy"" track from the daredevil soundtrack, and its ok.the album basically sounds like one big modern rock song, and its not too bad.basically the same old fuel, sticking too heavily on the ""if its not broken, why fix it"" which causes most of the tracks to come off unexciting and passable.if you like fuel, and enjoy bands like lit,tonic,course of nature, and ballad esque modern rock is your thing, then ""natural selection"" may have what you need to tie you over until the next ""real"" fuel disc."
3,The Copycat Band makes an almost Worthwile Effort,"THe only problem with this album is- ok, there are a few problems with this album, and, heck, even the band. First off let's start with the good stuff. The first song is extremely good, and the rest is ok. THe album is just kind of out there like a blob. IT seems like a band that can't find its own voice. I guess that's why they copy everyone else and try and create theire own sound. This album sounds alot like Puddle of Mudd, Soundgarden, and the first song is even reminicent of Korn. Unfourtunately after awhile it begins to drag on. The song can be on for 3 seconds and already you're wondering when the song is going to end. IT is not a terrible album, but it siriously needs alot of work, so i hope they come out with an album that shows the true talent hidden under all the conformity."
2,overproduced pile of nothing,loved the first album. it was fresh. good sound. slightly alice in chains but good. could listen to it wothout hitting the forward button. second album was ok. like candlebox but with less good songs. had to hit the forward button a few times. the singles were good. this album is bad. don't know where they're going with this besided not platinum. songs are way overproduced and go nowhere. even the hooks that nailed you on the first two albums are lacking. very disappionting.
3,What Happened Here?!?,"I'm a little surprised by this effort. The lyrics are not the quality I've come to expect from Fuel's writings. Every song on the CD has this strange intro sound that sounds amateurish. It's not nearly the hard rocker that Sunburn was and doesn't have the depth of Something Like Human. All in all, it an OK CD, but for a hardcore Fuel fan, it's honestly a bit of a letdown."
3,Low Octane,"Not a bad cd, but certainly not up to par with the 2nd release! Seems this band has 2 personalities, the radio friendly and the alt wanna be. This band is best when sticking to catchy lyrics and hooks, there are some excellent songs on Natural Selection, and then there are the ones that someone should have told them to yank off the track listing! Anyone that is familiar with Fuel's radio and video selections, just try and get through the very 1st track, not very likely! The band needs to find a direction and stick to it, atleast on each cd. Well worth a purchase but not a 3yr in the wait worth cd. There are better cd's out that are in the same vein as the radio friendly Fuel side and better ones out that are heavier and more melodic."
3,Fuel is running on fumes!!,"After two brilliant hard rock albums in ""Something Like Human"" and ""Sunburn,"" Fuel puts out a simply typical hard rock album. I'm a really big Fuel fan, but this album only has a few songs on it that I really dig. The first two albums were filled with simply awesome hard rock guitar riffing, but this album seems to be a little too pop rockish! Hopefully they will get back to their old selves on album number four!"
2,What happened?,"It's no way near the quality of the first two albums.It's over-produced and the singers voice doesnt sound as ""raw"" as it perfectly did on the first two albums. The music itself is pretty good, it just doesnt have the power and the originality from Sunburn and Something like human."
3,political propaganda,"Even though this is an entertaining work of fiction, be aware that there is a lot of political propaganda in it. People and groups have words and actions that would never occur in real life. One example is a Christian women's group who refrain from condemning adultery. Another is a man who has never told his wife about his mild romantic horseplay desires. There is a political party that cannot shuffle people between appointed offices."
4,A lament for Mexican immigrants,"BORDERS is dedicated to the Mexican migrants who struggle to cross the border into the US, and opens with a haunting contemporary lament in 'Mi Corazon Me Recuerda'.Accompanied here by pre-Columbian and Mexican folk instruments, Downs chooses a bass background and non-traditional style to add power to her lament."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!!,This was the first cd I had ever purchased from Lila Downs. It is by far one of my favorite cds. I am hooked on this artist! I now own all her cds.
2,Four-pointed flakes??,"This is a book ABOUT snow and ice, and everywhere the snowflake illustrations have four- and eight-pointed flakes. (Snowflake crystals are always 6-pointed, or based on a 6-point structure - never 4 or 8.) Maybe kids don't care, but it shouldn't have taken too much to get that right! Colorful illustrations, and the kids like it, but I'm not impressed."
2,"Average photos, disappointing narrative.","This book looked promising when I purchased it-the collaboration of a photographer and writer to produce a book that gives ""voice"" to the cat. I was disappointed that the reality did not live up to the promise. The photographs were not outstanding, I have seen better in several similiar collections. The narrative was truly disappointing. I felt that Roy Blount Jr really has no understanding of, or true appreciation for, cats. While he may have lived with cats in the past, and may have fond memories of some of them, the words he gave to the photographs fail to capture the essense of cats in all but one or two instances.I would highly recommend any of the willow creek books (such as ""What Cats Teach Us"", ""Bad Kitties"" or ""Cat Rules"" in place of this book."
4,"Excellent sequel, but not as good as Time Windows","This book was really good, I admit, but Time Windows was definitely better. Personally, I didn't like the ending to this book, but I won't give it away by saying why..."
2,"love the muppets, but too many innuendoes for young kids","I LOVE the Muppets, and was excited to watch this with my young kids after seeing the new Muppet Movie yesterday.I was rather surprised at how many sexual innuendoes were all this movie. Not a big deal for older kids, but too many formy parenting taste. They were all throughout the movie, not just one incident.Cute movie otherwise."
1,Don't even bother.,"If you like the idea of a movie where all of the Muppets act completely out of character, make totally unfunny jokes, and fail to entertain in general, then this is the movie for you.Seriously though, do yourself a favor and go find an uncut version of ""A Muppet Family Christmas"". That's the magic."
1,fooled by the title,I purchased this last year. Just opened it & watched it today. This is not what we thought it was. This was never a hit. I want the one with Fozzie's childhood home. This has very little of the Muppets. I didnt do enough research. This lloked like the right packaging but i was fooled. Thyis might as well go in the trash heap. I'd donate it to a children group but I dont want the kids to be crying & hating the Muppets.
2,"No sir, we didn't like it!",Even the kids couldn't sit through this one... Very disappointing as we are Muppet fans. Stick with the original movie.
1,Just say no....,"I've never quit watching a Muppet movie before the ending....until now.Horribly written, badly executed, and lacking the ""magic"" that makes the Muppets....well.....the Muppets.Even if you account for the very dated celebrities, bad pop culture references, and bizarre ""Life if Kermit was never born"" scenes this just falls flat.Watch the Muppet Christmas Carol instead. You'll thank yourself later."
1,...horrible,"I love the Muppets but this one was awful! Stick to the other muppet christmas specials. Whoppie Goldberg as God was insulting to Christians and Christmas but not just that. The story was a weak version of its a wonderful life and not very funny. ... I have all the muppet shows, toys, and movies.This was buy far the worst Muppet item I've seen. To the 15 year old who thinks the critism about Whoppie is racist, get a life. Jesus was a Jew by the way not African."
2,Not For the Kiddies,"This Muppet movie is definitely not for the kiddies and should not have been marketed in this genre. Quite frankly, we adults gravitate to the Muppets to rekindle the kid in us! On that note ... WHEN IS KERMIT THE FROG IN ""THE CHRISTMAS TOY"" GOING TO BE RELEASED ON DVD????"
1,Weep for innocence lost. . .,"The Muppets have always been tongue-in-cheek, always had a little something subtle to keep the adults entertained and charmed. The loss of Jim Henson was something keenly felt by all Muppet fans, but this movie had me mourning his passing all over again. I know we can't protect our children from everything, but a Muppet movie is not the context for introducing such topics as drugs and alternate lifestyles. I can't help but think that, now that Disney runs the Muppet industry, this was an inevitability. Avoid this movie. Apparently the backlash was noted by the company, because the next Christmas special was INCREDIBLY tame in comparison, and had a little of the classic Muppet charm. Not a great movie, but not the garbage that this movie was."
1,They fed the Muppets after midnight,"This is NOT your father's Muppets... very sharp edges, kind of dark, though well suited to the mean-spirited decade we've shared. But you just like to hope that there are always places of refuge - like the Muppets - where there can be a fun story, comedy at multiple levels, but without cutting everyone to shreds. Note to parents of young ones: this Muppet movie contains sexual innuendo, a binge drinking Animal, a cage-dancing Gopher, a litigious Burl Ives-type snowman and, it could be argued, a suicidal Kermit who tries to off himself by freezing to death... and so much more that earns this cynical production its lonesome star. From now on, I can't trust the Muppets franchise... a careful preview will be required before I let the Muppets into the living room with the kids."
3,An ok Muppet movie,"It was a pretty cheesy take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"". The movie had some funny parts but for the most part I didn't think it measured up to the other Muppet movies."
3,Not for small kids,"My kids thought this was funny, as did I, but there are several scenes that I believe are inappropriate for small children."
4,My son LOVES this.,"Not the best from the Muppets... but still decent since the Muppets are in it. My toddler however loved this! He loves everything with Kermit the frog and watched it from beginning to end without getting bored or distracted. It's not as well done as The Muppet Christmas Carol, but still very entertaining. Also a warning: there are some elements in this movie that some parents may find inappropriate for young children. I personally felt the Muppets didn't go to far, but they did elude to things like absinthe induced hallucinations, club/rave scenarios, etc. Again, nothing to take it above a PG rating, but something for some stricter parents to think about before giving this to a child."
1,Offensive!,"This movie opens with the muppets singing, then quickly moves to a scene with a bunch of men in a white office (complete with cubicles) representing angels. One of the 'angels' dares to go to their 'boss' uninvited. This 'boss' is a very snarky, sarcastic, not-to-be-bothered woman sitting on a couch in the middle of...ummm...a field supposedly representing God. And thus the movie begins.This movie makes a purposeful joke of, and slam against, a particular religion - namely Christianity. Not exactly the kind of movie that drums up the 'Christ-mas' spirit.It is filled with bawdy, sexual content, binge drinking and partying, cage dancing, and a topless bar. Yikes! This is not for kids.Thank you for reading!"
1,Would give 0 stars if I could,"This movie should *not* be marketed towards children. If you are old and loved the Muppets from way back when, then you will enjoy this. I am a Muppetaholic, but I will not let my kids watch this one. A Muppet Family Christmas and a Muppet Christmas Carol are must sees, but please, don't let your kids watch this one. There is NO reason to put sexual innuendos in a family movie, ever! Very disappointing."
1,Would give it 0 stars if I could.,"Shame on everyone who took part in this. The Muppets have been dragged through the mud with this abysmal movie filled with inappropriate, suggestive dialogue and situations. DO NOT let your children watch this awful, shameful movie. And Whoopi Goldberg?!?!?! Puh-leeze ... This is a travesty from start to finish. Instead, watch ""A Muppet Christmas Carol,"" ""Muppet Family Christmas,"" or ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street."" Even the early John Denver/Muppets special, inexplicably unavailable on video, is far better than this embarrassment. Avoid, like the plague."
1,Sadly Offensive,"I too would give this movie a ""zero"" if I could. I was so saddened to see that even the Muppets are no longer sacred. There was nothing charming about this movie. The sexual innuendo was so offensive I almost turned it off, but I kept hoping it would get better. Clearly whoever wrote this doesn't know who the Muppets really are. I would NEVER let my children watch this movie. My gosh, have we really sunk this far when we can't even let our kids watch the Muppets?"
2,Sadly frustrating,"We were excited to have a new Muppet movie to add to the family collection but 15 minutes into it---even the family Muppet expert was saying, ""Wow, this is really bad..."" Of course it is to be expected that the characters will change over time, with the passing or retirement of the classic puppeteers, but our disappointment and frustration came from the peculiar writing that seemed so uncharacteristic for our dear Muppets. The sexual comments, jokes and implications were too much for us---and we had no young children in the room.It felt as though the writers had no idea of who the Muppet characters have been---all these years and so wrote for characters that were completely foreign. We found it sadly tacky, humorless and in some places even ugly. In fact, the best parts were in the bloopers---particularly the wrestling match between Statler & Waldorf---where it seemed that the truer Muppet personalities came through."
1,Not what I'd expected,"Every Christmas my family watches ""Muppet Family Christmas"" and ""The Muppet's Christmas Carol,"" so I was looking forward to another Muppet Christmas movie. But I was really disappointed in this one. First of all, for those who dismiss all the inuendos saying that they'll just go over the kid's heads; kids aren't a naive anymore as alot of people would like to think. I work with alot of kids and know that they may not catch all of them, but most would get several. But even if they don't get them, why put them in a family movie in the first place?Then, I know that the alternate world where Kermit had never been born was supposed to be worse off, but in places it just went too far. Like when Fozzie was a pickpocket, that was ok,(they even got a halfway decent joke out of it.) But seeing Scooter as a cage dancer, that just creeped me out.And the ending; I'm not going to tell you what it is, but I will let you know that it's one that's unoriginal, and extremely overused."
1,Not for Kids or Adults,"This movie was so bad that I didn't care to focus my attention on it. What I saw and didn't like include:- a binge-drinking Muppet using a funnel surrounded by other Muppets chanting ""chug, chug, chug,..."",- a horny Muppet,- various sexual innuendos (they actually pointed out that they were innuendos),- ""angels"" depicted as part of an oppressive corporation,- using a cabaret as a theme for their Christmas play, including Muppets dancing in cages,- Muppets getting a license to make the theater a topless bar, and- The moral of the story is stated as: ""Christmas is about being with friends and family and getting revenge on your enemies""So basically it seems that the creators of this movie had several goals:- Make money from the Muppets characters- Use a Christmas theme- Denigrate Christianity- Intertwine adult humor to try to reach an adult audienceThere are far better movies to watch around Christmas than this garbage, especially those more appropriate for children."
1,Horrible,"I saw this on television the other night and it was just abysmal. I can't imagine what the ""critics"" are thinking who give this thing more than two stars. David Arquette should go back to doing 1-800-COLLECT commercials with Carrot Top. It's really depressing that the once-proud Muppet franchise has sunk to such depths. Don't waste your time."
1,Worst Special Ever!,"Let me start by saying that I am the biggest muppet fan and truly love Jim Hensons works. This movie however is a true travesty ans should never have been made. Way too much sexual innuendo in this movie! The jokes are is very poor taste for the muppets and thy should be held in a higher reguard.Mind you, this is coming from a man who likes howard Stern, animal house and numerous other off color comedy works but the muppets going to this level is not right. hopefully, Jim Henson's kids are as mortified as he would be and now that they have taken back the company things will change. Avoid this one!"
1,Sacrilege!!! Jim Henson will be spinning in his grave !!!,"Whatever happened to the good-humoured Muppets. This movie was just plain disturbing. Somehow the magic created by Jim Henson is impossible to recreate because this movie plain sucked. Now I am not a god-fearing Christian, so Whoopi Goldberg portraying God didn't bother me. What bothered me was the sexual innuendo and of-beat jokes that just seemed mean-spirited somehow compared to the old Muppets we have all come to love.I had to turn this movie of after 30 minutes because I just couldn't stand it anymore."
1,Not Child Friendly,"This is probably my own fault, as I don't remember the muppets being so incredibly unfamily friendly. I was appalled at the references to sex as well as language such as ""lets beat him up"", and a fight scene between the movie's ""villian"" and Ms. Piggy. Even from an adult perspective, the jokes were not funny and somewhat offensive. The role they give to Whoopi as ""the boss"" (aka God) was very offensive towards the Christian belief of God. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,The Best Muppet Movie since the orginal,"A smart, funny, and retelling of the classic ""It's Wonderful Life"" with a great songs, and emotional stories. There are NO beer bongs, drug use, and no uncaring God. I don't know what movie any of those people who said these things were watched, but it wasn't this one.It's a great movie. It's got stuff for kids and adults."
5,Good for kids,This is a good movie for my kids! I love this movie!! A kiddy version of It's a Wonderful Life.
3,Fine Muppet film that is more a commercial for NBC than a fi,"It's a fine film for small children but its more of an infomercial for upcoming NBC shows than a stand alone Muppet movie. That being said, it's a good family movie that has all the trimming of the holiday season and its really funny and heart warming, but expect to be bombarded with NBC guest stars."
5,Great Job of Bringing the Muppets Into Our Times,"First off, for the Veggietales guy, get a life. Bart and Milhouse were showing your bootleg videos to the cops while you were writing that very childish review, comic book guy. If you're not a muppet fan to begin with, why would you bother with watching this? I love the muppets, always have, always will. Yes, it's true that their name has gotten attached to some really crappy stuff lately, but hey, a man's gotta eat. This movie was very refreshing, however. It brought the muppets into the 21st century as best as can be expected. (for more on this, watch Kermit's interview on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart sometime, Kermit get's very modern.) Love the video, and the muppets will live as long as we do!"
1,Not the Muppets we loved,"This movie might be good for little kids, but definately not for anyone who is the slightest bit a Muppet fan. It is very Disney and doesn't have the old Muppet wit. As I tried to enjoy this movie, I found myself getting depressed.Buy the Muppet's Christmas Carol or Family Christmas (if you could afford it) instead.Disney ruins everything!"
1,awful,"I love the Muppets and used to watch The Muppet Show each time it was on, so I was thrilled to hear about another Muppet movie. I thought that the Muppet Christmas Carol was great, and I was looking for more like-minded entertainment. This was not it. The comic insult dog does not belong in a Muppet special. Nor does a scene that's a parody of Moulin Rouge (complete with Piggy saying ""Will you sleep with me tonight?"" to Kermit in French). I was greatly disappointed by this movie. Stick with the old classics -- this one is not one of them."
2,Not quite a rainbow connection,"Oddly enough, this film has a very similar plot to 2011's ""The Muppets,"" which came nine years later. The difference is that ""The Muppets"" is funny, and this film is not. Awkward humor, too many depressing moments, too many rude and embarrassing things that one wouldn't want one's kids to see.For Muppet holiday viewing, get the infinitely superior 1987 ""Muppet Family Christmas"" or 1992's ""Muppet Christmas Carol."""
1,No original content whatsoever,"This movie was horrifying. Parodies are all well and good, but there was nothing in tho movie that was original, other than Whoopi Goldberg as God (which was fantastic). The Scrubs cast doesn't make sense. The Moulin Rouge sketch gave me nightmares. Save yourself and avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to mock something. The new Muppets movie took some aspects from this movie and that's really all you need."
2,"I love the muppets but,",I love the muppets but this movie could've been better. Probably the worst muppet movie I ever seen. First time i had wished i had my money back.
2,Love the Mups-but no thanks.,"Sounded fine until I read who is cast as God. Whoopi Goldberg!? After her comments during the 2004 election season, I'll try to be polite and only say,- No Thankyou."
1,True delight to Liberals and Satan Worshippers,"If this had been entitled ""The Muppets Satanic Christmas"" would have been more proper. Whoopi Goldberg has no business pretending to be God. Then again, He will have her pay some day for it. Stick to those Christmas items that were done by Jim Henson. He didn't not seem to have the big love of Liberal Hollywood that is so evident with the current Muppet Management."
2,Disappointing,"Our family loves all the Muppet movies. However, this one was kind of disappointing. Whoopi Goldberg plays God and agrees to send an angel to help Kermit. Concepts went over the kids heads, movie was sometimes questionable for our family values, and kids got bored. We recommend The Muppets Christmas Carol instead. That is a family favorite!!"
2,Not up to Muppet standards,"I saw this movie for the first time on TV last night and was very disappointed. This is not a funny movie, it left me rather depressed. The acting is sub-par (Joan Cussack over-acts), the story sketchy, and overall it's just not what a Muppet movie should be. I should also point out this is not a movie for young children. The humor (what little there is) will be lost on them and the overall story is too dark.If you want a good holiday Muppet story, then the Muppet Family Christmas (albeit edited)is a far better choice. Other good Muppet holiday fare to watch is A Muppet Christmas Carol and Christmas Eve on Seseme Street."
1,A Very Miserable Muppet Christmas,"I am a big fan of the Muppet Family (Sesame, Fraggles, thee Muppets, Labyrinth, etc.)and so it is without hesitation that I write this review to say this Muppet release is best to be forgotten. Some have been pleased with the newer Muppet releases (Muppet Christ Carol, Muppets From Space) and disappointed (Muppet Treasure Island)... but this release is beyond disappointment or simply a bad movie.It's simply inappropriate for a Muppet film.Fozzie is a pick-pocket, which is sort of funny, but it goes downhill from there. Kermit is furious at everyone and apparently suicidal (screaming ""I wish I was never born!"" over... and over... and over again...). Miss Piggy is a Call Girl Operator. Peppe gets a permit to open a topless nightclub... and Scooter is an S&M; cage dancer. No joke.Forget about this one."
1,Horrible waste of Christmas time,"THE worst Muppet movie ever. Not funny, trashy, embarrassing to the Muppets. Please don't waste your time or your kid's!"
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!,"We didn't even make it to the end of this movie. Horrific scenes for children, such as beer-bonging egg nog, Kermit frozen to death, emergency room resuscitation, Frog Legs restaurant being observed by a horrified Kermit, and sexual trash talk to mention only a few offensive scenes for as far as we got before I threw this movie in the trash. What were they thinking? Not even funny for adult Muppets fans."
1,Worst excuse for a muppet movie ever,"My children and I have been muppet fans since the 1980 when they were little. We decided to watch this the day after Christmas, and even our grandchildren were disappointed. The humor is crass, the songs are non-existent or poor. Don't waste your time on this -- I wonder how they convinced the muppet producers to do this. Yes, watch THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL with Michael Caine which is my favorite version of the Dicken Christmas Carol."
2,Not the Best Muppet Movie,"I agree with other reviews that say this isn't the best Muppet movie. The Muppets have always had an edge, so that's not what I object too. It just seems like they forgot to add the Muppet humor and spirit to this one. If you want a Muppet Christmas movie,The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Editionis a classic. It's hilarious and in the Muppet spirit."
5,Circulon Infinite Covered Casserole,"Love this pan. It is super easy to clean. Nothing sticks. It is a little small for a big family, but it is useful for smaller portions."
5,I wish I had bought this sooner!,"I wish I had bought this sooner. It takes a little longer to heat up, because of the thick bottom, but when it does it keeps it hot alot longer. I haven't used it in the dishwasher yet, because it is so easy to clean. Marshmellos don't even stick to the casserole."
4,Quirky Solid Set of Stories,"Dark characters on the edge people this author's tightly written stories in this collection. One of reminded of Cormac McCarthy. If you want to be taken to far off, exotic locales, right here in your back yard, read this fine book by a accomplished author."
1,You've got to be kidding!?!? - Save your money,I don't normally get caught up with reviews (and so I'll keep it brief) - but this time I believe it is this reader's duty to warn fellow Amazonians. Never have I read a worse book. It is sooo terribly written and says virtually nothing about tango. Save your money and hours of agony. I did like the book cover ; )
1,Kiss and Tango,"One of those mistakes you sometimes make when buying online, K and T is a breathless paean to the author's busy Buenos Aires sex life. If it's tango you're interested in, don't bother with this book."
2,As a dancer.....,"I thought it was cool that a woman had the nerve to follow a dream and move to a completely foreign city.However, it's NOT cool that she lived off her rich parents' dime and didn't bother to get a job. It's not cool that she lied to her friends and told them that she taught English when in fact she lived in an apartment with a doorman while doing nothing.It's not cool that everyone she danced with thought she was, ahem, 'EASY', shall we say.And the most unfortunate thing at all is that after years of not working and doing nothing BUT dancing tango and ballet, she still looks like and ABSOLUTE beginner (judging from her website).Hey, at least she got mom and dad to fly her to Greece once the going got tough. That's pretty cool."
1,Claptrap,"This book does not deserve a review, but as a lover of Tango (and books), I have to say that it is truly an amazing self centered piece of work. Tango takes all of life, the old, the new, the lovely, the ugly, and makes them all a part of a beautiful artform. The word ""I"" is used so many times, repeated endlessly....not in the spirit of Tango-mind, which is like a spiritual practice as well as a dance form. It is time for a good book about the adventure of Tango, a work of a real writer, not this spoiled person. How on earth do these things get published?"
5,Good tool.,I have bought these for years and are very happy with them. They have a sharp cutting edge on the front 2/3 with the inside 1/3 being rounded to allow for pulling things like zip ties tight before cutting off the tail.
2,Need to rethink bed design,The bed is not as good as it was promised . The mattress supports dont stay in the side rail like they are supposed to. Had to use some southern rigging on the bed to keep it together. The child roll out barriers need to be bolted at both ends instead of one end.
1,Don't buy this if you play your CDs on your PC!,"Watch out! This audio CD will not play with windows media player. It says you need to update your player, then downloads its own software on your computer, forcing you to restart the PC. It will then only play via the new program. If you want to make a backup copy of the audio files with media player, it won't work. On the back of the disc box, in microprint, it says it is compatible with PCs etc. In barely discernable submicroprint, it says that it is copyprotected. Is this a new trend? Don't support it!! At least I bought the CD via an amazon reseller, so my money didn't go the California record company and band.The music? Well, if you want to hear california-ized post adolescent drinking songs, go ahead, get a used CD. I'll sell you mine. Incidently, if you want gaelic music you are better of getting any Battlefield Band CD."
5,"Delightful story; beyond Buddhist; each ""vignette"" chapter a jewel","Food for the soul. The basic story: A line of pilgrims snakes up a mountain to see the Holy Man in the small house at the top. Each chapter stands alone as a vignette, telling the tale of a different character, yet the story also builds. Though the images and circumstances are Buddhist, the nature of the story is broader in its appeal, and would be touching and of value to non-Buddhists, as well. Illuminating without any heavy morality lessons. I bought this book while on vacation, read through it on that trip and have re-read it many times since. I have sent numerous gift copies to beloved friends over the years. This book is a little gem!"
5,"Refreshing, like a breath of fresh air, a dip in cool waters","I loved this book. It is so simple and yet so profound. I got it because of a review I read in Unity magazine. It sounded so original. And that it was. Somehow you find yourself seeking answers... throughout the pages... but just like the people in the line you realize that you have all you need NOW in this instant. This book is like a lemon, I think you could read it over and over and squeeze out just a little more each time."
5,A book to carry with you.,"What a gem! This little book is simply and elegantly written. I found that I wanted to read only one chapter at each sitting, then to savor it overnight. Every visitor is a teacher for me. I can see so much of my own self in every one of those standing in line. And in that mirroring process, I can see through to another level.Absolutely brilliant! I highly recommend this book to everyone. (In fact, I just ordered 5 copies to have on hand for gifts.) Kudos to Susan Trott."
5,"Simply put, A Must Read","For those who enjoy a spiritual journey and a life of learning and growing this is a must read. Extremely simple but deep read with so many lessons that can be applied to our daily lives that provide some wonderful benefits. The first lesson we learn is to simply stop thinking so much of ourselves and what we can get out of other people and situations but to adopt a philosophy of giving which reaps some wonderful rewards. Read it, you'll be glad you did."
5,To be read again and again,"This is a small book with 34 short descriptions of people weall know in some way, even ourselves. I was fascinated with the waySusan Trott's characters got what they wanted or needed, sometimes without knowing they had been in the presence of The Holy Man. The humor is subtle but very appropriate and made this reader smile many times. I ordered copies for very special friends as I read it the second time. Tucked into my suitcase The Holy Man traveled through three states. I ordered 4 more copies for Christmas gifts. All brought rave reviews. Everyone who reads should have a copy but my retirement income won't allow me to be that generous. One reader was reminded of The Listener by Taylor Caldwell which I too had read years ago. This is a book I wish I could have written. It is just as F-A-S-C-I-N-A-T-I-N-G in the fourth reading."
2,I don't get it,"After all the great reviews and a recommendation from a friend I read The Holy Man with a ""huh?"" after every chapter. Maybe I am simple minded, but I just plain didn't get it. Okay, so it gave some examples of human nature, but I thought they were things everyone already knew. And, the Holy Man, himself, had so many weaknesses...why would anyone go to him? What made him so special? And, if all the answers are in ourselves, then why do we need God? And, what of the Savior and the Atonement? This book left me depressed and discouraged, but most of all puzzled. It caused me to wonder what is wrong with me that I didn't get it and become enlightened. Symbolism? What the heck did the thing about the ponies mean? Why not just say it right out? Sorry, but I wasn't enthralled and captivated. I gave it 2 stars because some of the ""pilgrims"" were interesting."
4,Decay,"Doty recently visited my college, and after I read his work, I felt truly honored to have met him. He was a wonderful speaker, and very personable.This shows through his poetry as well. He is a person speaking on real issues, in a very contemporary manner. Not only is AIDS a question of the homosexual culture and lifestyle, but something for the family, circle of friends, and nation to pause and consider.Yet, Doty does well in keeping the theme of decay and demolishment in check with painfully potent words that make you pause and think. Though, there is hope, and this is not horribly bleak."
3,My MOR,"Mark Doty is a gifted writer, but there is such a mix of profound work and slight image in My Alexandria, that he comes with a little too much hype for someone coming to this book first. There are some exquisite images, but as an AIDS work, this is slim. This work is more about our humanity and how we deal with what we face in the world more than it is about a pandemic.The most moving poem in this collection is, ""With Animals"", which is wisely used in the closing third. Some of the work is empty and rich at the same time, which is a lot like a Hostess Cupcake, but we can't live on cupcakes. When Doty really reaches, his work is utterly transforming. Here it is progressive and showcases the talent he shows later in his career."
1,"Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing","It's difficult to criticize a book so full of emotional content without seeming harsh. But Doty's poems seem to begin as empty vases into which he jams far too may flowers. In the end, he can't hide the fact that they're just big empty jars. So much truly moving poetry is being written from the AIDS pandemic: Aaron Shurin's ""Unbound,"" D. A. Powell's eloquent ""Tea,"" William Dickey, Marie Howe, Thom Gunn's ""The Man With Night Sweats."" And then this posturing prose, broken into lines, that is My Alexandria. Pity."
5,Beautiful book and a well written introduction.,"Great book for someone interested in photography. A well printed book illustrating the work of a defined photographer. If you like Salgado, then there is no excuse not to buy it."
3,Witty and a quick read,"A quick and entertaining read, this book is woth buying. The descriptions of the transportation woes do drag on a bit, as another reviewer noted, but not so much that I wanted to put the book down. This work certainly leaves you with no illusions about what it's like to travel in the remote parts of China. Witty and poignant in places."
3,"Honest, refreshing, funny","I really enjoyed this book. The author's basic premise is interesting. The four unlikely companions who depart on the journey are outrageous and funny. Especially the description of the Uighur ""minorities"" was touching. A little more history would have been welcome... But, very readable, enjoyable and funny. Definitely recommended."
4,Unexpectedly good book,"I picked this book up at the library and expecting it to be a quick skim, was pleased when it turned out to be a page-turner. ""Night Train to Turkistan"" is an in-depth look at everyday China as it was in the 1980s. (Though I suspect that much of rural China is still like this in 2012.) The only thing lacking -- photos. This book cried out for more visuals, otherwise, it was engrossing."
1,Give it a miss,"This book was nothing more than an incessant rant about Chinese bureaucracy and Chinese people. I'd strongly advise you to give it a miss, because in a little over 50 pages, it will start getting on your nerves. It is very hard for me to believe that someone could travel this long, yet not find one good word to say about the people or the place. The gist of the book is the paragraph where he compared China to an army-every thing else is essentially elaborating this theme.If you want to know how one can be funny without being offensive, read Douglas Adams's account of his visit to China in ""Last Chance to See""."
3,"It is heartwarming, nostalgic, and warm - by a nice man.","Gee, how refreshing: a book without violence or obscenities! Wonderful stories of growing up - really takes you back to a more innocent time, if you're over forty. Lovely reminiscences. No huge problems solved here, just a nice walk back in time to meet a ""good guy"" in the growing-up process."
2,Product great! Shipping packaging Job Awful,The Grex Brad nails are awesome. The box was shipped loose in a much larger box so when they arrived many were all smashed up and separated.
5,excuse me!,I cannot believe this is out of stock. Why is this CD not available? I have been looking all over the place trying to find it!
5,A big John Conlee fan from Missouri,You need to re-issue this CD. I've been looking for it and can't find it anywhere. There is even a radio station in the area that's looking for John Conlee music and they can't find any. Please re-issue this CD.
5,I NEED TO GET THIS CD!,"My boyfriend has spent months looking for any of his cd's with the song common man on it. Now that we have seen this cd on your website we are willing to pay almost anything for it. I would love to get it for him for his birthday. You have to make this cd and his other greatest cd available to the hundreds of people looking for it. ""You are our only hope"""
5,What is the problem?,"Why on earth do you have this out of stock? I have been wanting another copy since my house burned, and I sincerely believe that it is a big winner. There are a lot of us who enjoy that gritty voice of John Conlee and can't travel well without it! That is why I am in a bad mood when I have to travel. Please, please get back John for us......We need himBarbara Turner N. Little Rock, Ark"
1,This ranks up there as one of the dumbest books ever ..,"So theres this sultan and his little harem and he was totally obsesses that his wives/concubines tell him the truth about their love affairs and sexual encounters. So, in comes the magic lamp and the genie that gives the sultan a magic ring. I he turns the ring towards any women she will be forced to tell him what he wants to know .....Only thing is, the women may not talk through their mouths but rather through their jewels .... meaning of course their vaginas .... WOW ... it's like a classical play of the current Broadway hit the Vagina Monologues ....Thats really about where any similarity ends cause the stories and the writing are bad bad bad bad ..... Maybe the fact that this book was originally writtten in French and then translated into this English edition ....If I were lost in the desert and this is the only form of entertainment available to me .... trust me I wouldn't read it ....."
5,Great Condition!,"The book I purchased was in excellent condition. Best of all, it only cost $4.38! It would have cost $70 at the college bookstore, and the condition wouldn't have been as good."
2,Good but could be better.,"When I purchased a sleeve for my ipod and realized I would also need screen protection, I immediately came back to amazon and began reading customer reviews on similar products before deciding on this one. I made the item work but not without some effort. In the end, I found this item had many of the same problems described in other reviews:- It didn't fit my screen properly and actually had to be trimmed down to an appropriate size.- Once adhered to my ipod screen, the shield was mostly clear but I still had a problem with bubbling. No matter how well I cleaned the screen or protective shield, bubbles remained. I pressed as hard as possible with the cardboard squeegie provided in the package to make sure the shield was flat and properly adhered. My efforts made little difference. I soon purchased another sleeve/case that should provide full protection, including the screen."
1,Not what I purchased!,"The product that was shipped to me was not what I had purchased. The screen protecter that was sent did not even come close to fitting my Ipod Video....it was more for a cell phone. Very disapointing, I threw it right in the trash!! Wish I could have given them no stars!"
1,sticky stuff,this item arrived unusable as the adhesive used to attach the placement tab would not come off
3,poor marketing,"The product works just fine, let me say that first. The speed dials up and down wonderfully and it feels great....however....being one for aesthetically pleasing experiences, it almost embarrasses me to be giving this as a gift. The thing looks like a cheap childs' toy. The owners manual pictures are so blurry you can't even tell what they're trying to show you, and the words both on the box, and more importantly, the ENTIRE manual are SOOOO poorly translated from whatever language they were written inoriginally that I can barely make sense out of what's being said. To me, if a product costs as much as this one did, care should be taken by the manufacturer and/or distributor to ensure 100% customer satisfaction."
5,Best Foot Massager!,"This massager is strong and works Great! It gives you a deep massage. It may seem a little rough at first, then it feels so good. I've had the vibrating kind but they can't come close to the job this one does. It's really quite also! Buy it and Enjoy!"
2,HURT MY HUSBAND'S FOOT,"My husband had to return the product because it hurt his foot to use it. Only took one try to do this. The Company was good about returning it to them, but we had to pay the shipping charges which was very expensive because it is very heavy.. If you have sensitive feet, don't order this product."
4,Very intense massage,"This massager was great,however it was too intense for my husband's diabetic condition. I had to return the massage wonder but I would reccomend this product to anyone in good health."
3,Review,"Its nice if you enjoy having your feet crushed.. I suppose its not so bad when you adjust your feet correctly, but until then its more painful than soothing."
5,A very good but very strong massager but maybe too strong for elderly,"For me, I have several foot massager as I have some foot pain. This one is being the strongest and most powerful. Unlike other reviews, I feel this maasger is not painful at all and it's squeeze is strong. If ther is pain, it will be gone right after the massage or after you get used to. However, my mother has diabetes and she cannot use this massager. This massager maybe better for younger people and not senior citizen who has no experience with foot massager. It suits my need of a strong massage and help me to feel relax afterward. It is almost like drinking a cup of coffee. I feel like a get a boost of health and energy after using this massager."
5,Big Book Crossword Puzzles,"This is not my first Big Book of Crossword Puzzles, as I enjoy having them in several rooms of the house, as well as in our cars. I will be buying this book again, as I find crossword puzzles to be a enjoyable learning experience and you can't beat that. This book was in A-one condition."
2,"Competent, but...","This is what I believe to be the second release of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2 on Super Audio CD. While competent, it still suffers from several issues.The soundstage presented in the recording seems too far back from the orchestra, and, as a result, the strings sound mushy in all but the quietest section. It's lush, yes, but in my opinion, too much so.I find J√§rvi's interpretation a bit peculiar, with some parts that are rushed past and others comparatively dragged through. In my opinion, the best interpretation of ""Little Russian"" belongs to Svetlanov's 1967 recording with the USSR State Orchestra, although the recording [or at least the mastering during its short stint on the Moscow Studio label] is on about the same level as this. If you can find it, I'd track down the re-release of Svetlanov's recording on the Pipeline Music label- even iTunes has it, and the interpretation and mix is superior to this by far."
1,A Wasted effort,"I ordered this book thinking it would be great for a bit of light reading, but it turned out to be dark and dank,like a Provencal cellar; turning pages and hoping that the next will bring new light. Boy was I wrong!!! This book sucked! I've read many books written by travel writers but this has got to be one of the worst! The authors detail of everything was complete overkill. The characters and places was uninteresting (but could have been had she taken time to develop them). The book is supposed to be about restoring a ruin but the author ruins it by talking about her lack of French, interpreting bill, currency, etc. This is one book that's going to the used book store for a trade in!"
3,"Good, but 8"" not 10""","This boots are warm and comfortable, but they are much shorter than 10"".It is misleading to advertise them as 10"" when they are in fact 8""."
1,Men's slippers,"Horrible!!! There were two of the same Left shoe. And, it was the second time I had returned the slippers. Very dissapointed! Didn't know about the review process when I purchased them. Not 100% sure I ever got my refund. Will not purchase slippers from this seller ever again."
5,Great mix of features and price,"I purchased this item based on it being top rated by Consumer Reports magazine. I have been very pleased with the ease in which it could be set up, and the thought that went into its design. The controls are easy to use and the sound is fine."
4,Workhorse,"I bought this thing about 4 years ago. My main issue with it is that the sub output is only one RCA jack, most subs have 2 inputs. An adapter didn't seem to work very well. I now run a main line to the sub which then splits the signal to the surround speakers. On the plus side, it has plenty of power, I've never had it louder than -10. It has also never overheated, despite being in a very tight enclosure."
4,excellent buy,"I was looking for a receiver so I could have Surround sound with my DVDs. There are very few low to mid level stand alone receivers (I already had a DVD player).This one is excellent. It has enough inputs that you can slowly upgrade parts one at a time (flat panel TV, DVD player, game console, CD-player, etc.). I bought 5.1 speakers, but it's possible I could upgrade to 6.1. It also has A/B speaker inputs so I can set up anouther room with music.An excellent buy. Great price too."
2,Long-Term Durability?,"I bought mine from Circuit City almost a year and a half ago for $399, replacing a Kenwood 9G that I bought 25 years ago, which worked flawlessly, but lacked the convenience of a remote.It seemed like a great deal, even at that price, working flawlessly until two months after the one-year warranty expired, when it began to show F70 on the display panel. The repair shop found a short and a blown fuse, costing $1.50 for the part and $55 for the labor (plus the 70 mile round trip to the nearest repair shop, twice).Three weeks later, F70 showed up on the display again and another trip to the repair shop only to find another blown fuse, which was replaced free of charge. So far it has lasted 2 weeks without a hitch.I figure if it keeps working this time it's still not a bad deal, but if it quits again I'm getting out the old Kenwood and this sucker is going on Ebay.UPDATE: The unit has continued to operate flawlessly since it was repaired."
5,great value for the price,"Despite what some other reviewers have said, I found this amp extremely easy to install and operate. I'm using it with a 6.1 speaker system, and the sound is wonderful. Great definition and accuracy across the frequency range, lots of 'punch'. For the price, I am very impressed with how many options there are for tailoring the sound. Being an avid LP listener, as well as CDs, I appreciate a modern amp that still has phono inputs!"
4,Pretty good country album,"I have to confess that it's been quite a while since I've listened to country music. I came across this album while converting my cassette tapes to digital to preserve what hadn't deteriated. This album is one of George's better ones. I quite listening to his music when he came out with that stupid fireman song (yeah, I know it was a popular song but I didn't like it. It wasn't country music to me). This album has a good mix of swing and slow. If you're a George Strait fan, this is a must have. However, I feel that the album Strait From The Heart is a much better album."
1,wat are they thinking,"s.a.s use to be one of the greatest hardcore bands out there.compassion fills the void,rituals of life,revolution transmission were all amazing hardcore cds then i went out and bought engage and lost all respect that i had for them. horrible cd they are more punk then hardcore and honestley the only good song on it is express yourself wich is a rap and the only reason i like it is beacuse u can c walk 2 it hahhahaseriouslly dont waste your time on this cd"
5,Because You're Pregnant,"I found this film answered all of my most urgent questions related to pregnancy. The stories by real-life expectant mothers, beautiful graphics, and very funny animations made the film's content easy to understand and enjoyable to watch."
4,Fun but tedious,"I bought this dollhouse this past summer. This is my first dollhouse kit. It is very complex and time consuming but can be fun. I would suggest getting a house that is more simplistic if you are just starting out. Like a house that is a rectangle, no towers or such."
4,Second Try,The owner did well by sending another shipment after first one received was not up to par. That was very kind of him. The second shipment was much better. I remember as a child (70 yrs old now) we would be able to get center cut veal cutlets and veal steaks (with little bone in middle) for our special day on sundays. These cutlets were much better then first delivery. Thanks so much for backing your product
5,LORETTA TELLS OUR STORIES,"I LOVE LORETTA -- THEY (The producers of records) back in the 40s and 50s said that WOMEN WILL NOT BUY WOMEN. So, there were no big female stars. Then came PATSY CLINE she started a trend. She was the greatest.Loretta came on the scene and started a revolution in the country music. She sang about the facts of life -- the other woman -- the pill (the first time I heard it on the Radio in Chicago was the last time.) It was so shocking it was banned in Chicago!! But we bought her record by the hundreds, thousands. And proved that women WOULD buy women. And she went on to write about life, love, happiness and unhappiness. SHE IS TREMENDOUS. SHE IS TALENTED. And she is beautiful.Dorothy W. RossaChicago, Illinois"
4,"Soft and fuzzy, but smaller than I thought it would be","This giraffe definitely lives up to the ""fuzzy"" part of its name, its super soft and cuddly. Aside from that, it's just a stuffed animal, so there isn't much to say. But it does seem smaller than 11"", I'm not sure where they're measuring from. It is much smaller than I thought it would be."
4,Simple and helpful,"Simple is the key. This book provides descriptive suggestions for any color scheme. How to punch up a white room, what colors look great with black and white, or maybe just showing a hint of color in your room. Broken up into many colors and moods and it helps you to create wonderful rooms with more suggestions of colors and accents. Nice 110 page book that fits easily on my shelf..."
3,Just Okay,"I'm a big fan of the Better Homes and Gardens books but this one fell short. I thought the photography was either too bright or too dark. Many of the rooms had small pictures so it was difficult to see details. The color combinations were uninspired or unattractive. Many of them caught my eye because the colors were just plain ugly. LOLThe reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the before and after pictures, which I really like in decorating books and the information in the text is good. There are better books out there, even in the BH&G; series."
2,Not so good.....,BH&G; apparently just threw this one together....not really sure why.The only redeeming factor here is the eye candy....no new or good information to speak of.Color schemes presented were not well executed or demonstrated in my opinion.I would pass on this one .....
3,NIce Score...........BUT !,"If you were amongst the few lucky audience members to assist viewing a presentation of STARLIGHT EXPRESS when it graced the boards in NYC during it's breef 80s run, then you'll enjoy this compacted ensemble of songs on this CD. However, if you are searching for a CD that best represents the show; this is NOT THE CD TO PURCHASE. I strongly suggest the recently revised CAST version from LONDON. EL DeBARGE as a lead vocalist (""where is he now?"") does not cut it when trying to listen to the main theme composed by LOYDD WEBBER."
1,Good Show...Bad album,"I loved the show when it came out and had the original cast recording on a record, but this is not it. The songs on this CD just do not have the feeling, emotion and pop that they deserve. These pop singers do not understand the characters, let alone the story, therefore do not do the songs justice. If you want to get a CD of Starlight Express, take the time and spend the money on the original cast recording!"
3,I found it!,"I've been looking for this recording for a while now and I'm really glad that amazon had it. My Uncle was a part of the original cast and my sister and I used to sing Starlight Express together all the time (we were 4 and 6... give us a break). It brings back lots of memories and even though the show didn't last long and some of the music is goofy, I'll treasure this thing :)"
4,4.5 stars actually,"A very interesting look at the origins of Starlight Express, with a heavy '80s rock feel. My favorite track (heh heh, little train humor there) is Only You, with I Am The Starlight coming close behind. I don't like One Rock 'n Roll Too Many or Light at the End of the Tunnel, but Lotta Locomotion, Starlight Express, Pumpin' Iron... everything except the aforementioned two is great, is great, is great!"
1,Just awful,"This recording cannot compare to the original London cast recording. For some reason, the American version eliminated the better songs (including the beautiful ""Starlight Express"" title song and ""U.C.O.U.P.L.E.D"" ) and musically, the arrangements are uninteresting. Even my 8-year old daughter thought the American version was terrible. By the way, the original ""Starlight Express"" is also far better than the revised London version now playing."
2,Needs more good song's but it's O.K.,"This c-d was O.K. It was not that great it needed some better songs, people needed to be louder and the words needed to be more clear. I think that the tunes should be like the original ones for example 1 of the songs was put to the tune of a different song and it did not go thay well together. If there were any instraments in the background (I think I heard some) some of the instraments sounded blury but other then that the c-d was O.K."
2,Broadway and Pop Stars Rarely Mix Well,"Although this is not necessarily one of Andrew's greatest scores, it still has some great melodies and coupled with the staging, is a very exciting show. I hate it when they think mixing Pop Stars with a Broadway score will sell. In most cases, when a Broadway score is ""popped up"" with Pop singers instead of Broadway singers, you get a mishmash that really doesn't work for either pop fans or show music fans. It may not be either fish but, in this case, it is foul. I give 2 stars only for the original score, but otherwise this is only mildly interesting and listenable as an addition to the Lloyd Webber fan (which we are legion) that wants to collect EVERYTHING the great man writes."
3,fit good but can't find a cup to fit!,"This was a good short, but I can't find a cup to fit in it. Everything is too big. Probably going to have to send back. Went to dick's sporting goods to try all the ones they sell. None of them worked."
2,Results,"This Optical Cable is pretty good quality, however, the end of the cable part will not stay connected to an xbox 360 or majority of components. It connects pretty firmly on my Sony receiver, but the rest forget about it. I actually read the same from other reviews, but decided to go ahead and but it anyways. I do not recommend this cable for any gaming console. It will not stay connected unless you use tape or something that keeps it from disconnecting.The cable arrived sooner than i though during the Christmas holidays. I was pretty impressed, but unfortunately the cable end is poorly engineered."
2,"Does not transmit 5.1, only stereo","This product should transmit a fully digital 5.1 surround sound signal, but all it is transmitting is a 2 channel stereo signal."
1,Kills Surround Sound,"I bought this cable after reading all the positive reviews despite being concerned with the extremely low cost. When I plugged it into my receiver, I got sound only out of my center channel speaker, and not the other four. Compared to a Philips cable, which keeps all speakers working without any other modifications or changes to settings. I would not recommend."
1,Instruction are needed for this product.,"This product needs one line of instruction. ""Remove the plastic cap that covers the tip of the optical cable.""What I received does not look like the picture. In the picture the protective caps are attached to the cable and is a clue that you don't insert the protective cap into the stereo.This cable has the protective caps and needs to be remove before insert into the stereo. Since I've never seen or used an optical cable I didn't know this.Learn from my mistake.I'm giving this product one star out of frustration with having to figure this little detail out on my own."
1,Don't waste your money,"Total POS, The cable is cheap cheap cheap. Wont even waste my time trying to get a replacement or refund. On this one you get what you pay for. Literally self destructed in my hands. The sleeve aroung the optical calble broke when inserted into the port. And no this was not the shipping protector."
1,Taito Legends,"Do not buy! The software will not run properly on Windows XP, and there is no customer support. A total waste of money."
4,Fun for parents and kids,At first after reading the other reviews I was thinking of not buying the game at all. But I found a site on which there were patches for the game. So I decided to buy the game (european version). After delivery I installed the game on a windows ME pc and it worked very well. Also on my Xp pc it is still working very well and I enjoy the old games very much as do my daughters. If you like the old arcade games this is definitely a gamepack you should buy
1,Game Never Worked!!!,"Do not waste your money. I was never able to get the game to work. I would have rated it with all ""0"" but the lowest rating is ""1"".Sega support was no help--I never talked to a human being.WORTHLESS!!!"
2,"Boring choreography, great costumes & blueray","I agree with other reviewers that the Blueray filming & costumes were excellent. However, the most important thing about a ballet is the choreography, and here it it frequently boring. I also don't feel that Chopin's music fits the story or the choreography very well, so sometimes it seems to be simply background music unrelated to what is happening on stage."
5,"consider me pop, for i have been saved.",this is the best music ever. EVER. anyone that doesn't like this album is insane. it made me laugh....it made me cry.....it made me hungry.
3,Not Suitable for Landline Phones - Only for Cell Phones,I own this product and have used it for 1 month. Product finish and quality is good. I bought it to use with our home phone with 2.5mm plug jack. For the headset user the sound is very good. For the other person the headset user's voice is too far away - but still audible. (They always can tell when you are using it). No way to adjust mic or headset volume.
1,Worthless. B'berrys don't bother...,"Too inexpensive an item to mess with a return, but it's basically a non-functioning headset. Yes, it works, but barely audible at full volume and voice barely gets heard. Save your $$ and buy something else."
3,"My voice sounds great, can't hear on the freeway, doesn't fit my ear shape","I have medium-to-small girl ears, and this headset doesn't work with them. It always flops down and doesn't stay put; definitely feels like it's made for larger ears, or ears of a different shape. My voice sounds great to my callers, and there is terrific noise cancellation for them, however the road noise from my older car plus the somewhat quiet nature of this headset means I cannot, simply cannot hear when driving on the freeway, and it drives me crazy. I end up driving with one hand on the wheel and one hand jamming the headset into my ear to try to hear better. And since I drive a stickshift this is not a great situation. Eventually broke down and bought yet another headset (LG wired stereo headset) and can finally hear the other party."
1,Not exactly as described...,I have used this type of Plantronics headset in the past for my cell phone and was very pleased. I now have a Blackberry. The product description stated that this headset would fit the Blackberry and it does not! The plug basically swims in the headset hole of the Blackberry. I am disappointed.
4,Plantronics MX256,"Resonably priced and a very good product. The quality of voice is good and it is very easy to operate. The ear pice is a bid loose and does not sit firm, you might have to hold it in plcae to hear better."
1,Maybe counterfeit,"I bought this headset believing it was like other Plantronics headsets I've used with my wireless (portable) phones in the past. But I was unable to use it, because the 2.5mm pin was partially covered by a sleeve that prevented its being completely inserted into the phone jack. It also bore no identification with Plantronics nor any instructions. It came in a plain plastic bag that did not bear the Plantronics name or any identification with Plantronics. I returned it to Amazon and concluded that it's probably a counterfeit.Recommendation: Avoid this item. Spend a little more and get one of the Plantronics MX500 under the ear models. I got the MX505 Wind Smart and am happy with it so far, but all the models in that series appear to be basically the same, varying only in features. By the way, my new phone came in a plastic case (the kind you have to cut open), in a box with clear Plantronics identification and a set of instructions."
1,Stopped Working Almost Immediately,"This is really cheap. Its sold for less than $5 in some places online. That should have been an immediate red flag.The microphone stopped working right away, and it was really uncomfortable while it did work."
1,Both products didn't work,"I order two of them and they both stopped working after a day. Upon closer inspection, the wires to the jack looked like it was dry rotted and it was crimped at the time it was packaged and as a result, the microphone didn't work. I returned one of them but not the other because I didn't have the original packaging. Would not recommend this product."
1,Will not buy again!,This review is about Cellular AccyStore and not the product. No customer service! Waited over a month and still no shipment. They said I gave them a wrong address. Stay away from these people.
1,Microphone doesnt work,"I really wanted to like this product, but I will pretty much need to buy a new headset to replace it. The speaker works fine and with no problems, but the microphone is not sensitive enough to transmit any voice. I end up having to either yell or just remove the headset."
5,Worth every penny,"I use this headset everyday for at least an hour and have been using it for 8 months. The sound quality is great on both ends. I don't have to max out the volume to hear the other person. People I talk to can't tell if I'm using a headset or not. They also can't hear me typing while using this which is great, but they can hear my dog barking outside with the windows open. Never tried it outside so I don't know about quality there. This device clips gently on the earlobe. It leaves no marks even after talking for 2 hours, it's very comfortable to wear. I had to buy this adapterHeadset Buddy: 2.5mm Phone Headset to 3.5mm Adapter - Convert 2.5mm Headset to 3.5mm iPhone, Blackberry, Palmin order to use the headset for my LG Dare. Both products work fine together."
4,Does the Job,"Bought two of these, one for the wife. For the money you can't beat it. The fact that they connect at the bottom of your ear is a nice design feature. It's comfortable and people have no problem hearing you."
1,Doesn't work on the models Plantronics claims it does.,"I bought this for my Nokia 6085. The ear bud works, I can hear the caller, but the microphone doesn't. Do more research prior to buying."
1,DOES NOT FIT RIGHT AND NO NOISE!,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IT LOOKED NICE BUT REALLY IS SUCKS THERE WAS NO VOLUME AND DID NOT FIT MY XBOX CONTROLLER DONT BUY THIS YOU CANT HEAR NOTHING
3,Should mention only for cell phones,"I bought this to use with my landline phone, but it won't plug into it. The plug in is too small.I may not be versed when it comes to electronics, but it seems that if they would just mention SOMEWHERE that it is for cell phones, for those of us that use landlines phones, it would be helpful. I am contacting the seller to see if there is an adapter that could be used.If I get an adapter, I will revise this review to let people know what they will need."
3,Plantronics MX256-X1 review,"this product looks good on paper and it probably will work well, if it fits your ear properly. I have used ear-hook sets before, and was very pleased with an older ear-hook unit from Plantronics - but this one surprised me a little, having difficulty inserting over/in my ear. I will have to practice a little more but so far it is not working as quickly or simply as the older plantronics unit I had (which failed, requiring replacement)."
2,Disappointed,"I haven't tried this headset with a cell phone, just a wireless home phone, and it was disappointing. Everyone that I spoke to while using the headset reported that I sounded very far away. If your searching for a headset, don't end your search with this one. :-("
4,Bellamy Brothers Greatst Hits.Vol 2,I liked this but it is not as good as my previous purchase--actually some of the songs were already on the previous Cd
5,Bellamy's biggest hits 1983-1987,"This CD has most of the biggest hits from the aforementioned period of the Bellamy's career. This CD picks up where Greatest Hits Volume One left off. It contains all of their top 10 country hits from 1983 to 1987 like ""When I'm Away From You"", I Need More Of You"", ""Old Hippie"" and ""Too Much Is Not Enough"" with the Forester Sisters.If you have this CD, you should also get Greatest Hits Volume One and Greatest Hits Volume Three. Volume Three is however out-of-print and hard to find. You can still find copies of Greatest Hits Volume Three at Amazon Marketplace."
5,Bellamy Brothes Greatest Hits vol.2,Great music. Highly recommended for those lovers of country music.
2,Daily Reference Guide,"True, this book can be a cut-to-the-chase reference, but it depends on what you're looking for. A lot of the stuff is good, but I dont like the chart form. If you're looking for a disease its not that fun to find it, let alone read it in the skinny columns. I bought it but I never use it."
3,It works well but requires a bit of fitting.,"The grip is slim and I like the finger groves. Had to do some trimming around the mag release, slide stop, the sear pin/safety retaining pin (ambi safety) and on the protrusions that fill the channels on either side of the grip safety.It nicely increases traction, the material is very similar to what hogue uses."
5,Birthday present,I bought this as a birthday present for my husband and he loves it. The grip fit the gun perfectly.
5,Can't go wrong with this album.,"Great album by a terrific band that should have got a lot more recognition. It's the perfect late 80s album that features a dark sound with haunting lyrics.""And we're happy here, but we live in fearWe've seen a lot of temples crumble.Some of flesh and blood from love under glass.Will we come undone? will we turn and run?And will we know it when we find it?It's a game the way we dance along the edge.And we'll walk the line and we'll do our timeFor just as long as we've been given,And pretend that we don't hear the things they've said.Can we promise love? is it all too muchAnd do our old souls still believe it?It's insane the way we dance along the edge.""Johnette Napolitano -- ""Dance along the Edge"""
1,"Large Core, Little Paper","You might be a little dissapointed when you put your first roll on, there is hardly any paper on it. 176 sheets is a very small roll of paper. The quality of paper is good, but seriously don't buy this!"
2,Ehh I don't like the new X,"Ok I am old school Sactown rap fan, I know it all, Lynch, Doc, Loki, X-Raided, Lunasicc, Killa Tay, you name it. And I just don't like the new sound of X-Raided. He tries to rap all fast, his lyrics are good but the beats are HORRIBLE, someone find a producer who can make X good again because I haven't liked him since the Nefarious cd. I wouldn't waste my money on this one."
1,Driver would not install under Windows 7,"Windows 7 professional could not install the device driver so I never got this to work. Send back for a refund. Tried driver downloaded from startech.com and it runs for a few minutes and then I get an error telling me a .inf file is not found. Tried several times with the device plugged in and not plugged in, got the same error no matter what. I'll stick to usb to serial devices that use the FTDI chip set, they work with windows 7."
4,Shostakovich: suites for film and stage.,"I bought this CD for the romance of the Gadfly, but i have to say that the rest of the CD is quite good."
1,Not the guide you want...,"Potential buyers should know that this ""guide"" is essentially little more than a list. About each school or day care, it contains address, tuition, and 3-5 more lines of information.I went looking for such a guide because I was dissatisfied with the Independent School Guide for Washington, DC and Surrounding Area (I have 10th edition), which has about a half page per institution, plus sections on how to choose, consultants, other information. While neither has any sort of ranking or comparative information (what I was after), the Independent School Guide is much more informative and detailed than the Washington School and Daycare Guide."
5,Satisfied with purchase,"I received the air purifier promptly and received the correct product. I've had problems previously with ordering this machine (from a different seller), because I had orderd the Healthmate Junior Plus, but received the basic Healthmate Junior. It's buyer beware with these air purifiers, because Austin Air, the manufacturer, doesn't put the ""Plus"" on the machine. So I had to call Austin Air with the serial number to check, and that's how I found out I received the wrong item. Amazon and the other seller were great about taking the machine back. Now I chose this seller and am very pleased to have received the right air purifier. Austin Air purifiers have a good reputation and I see them at the offices of several of my doctors so I believe I'm in good company ordering them. This one is going into my child's bedroom."
3,Austin Air Healthmate Jr.,"The unit has a nice design and structural very well build. It has 3 fan speed settings which bring me to the problem. Speed setting 1 & 2, although very quiet, the intake air is not noticeable at all.... it is unable to hold up just the littlest of tissue when placed against the 4 intake air surfaces. In other words, there is no air intake at all. Speed 3 is the only setting that appears to take in air and is also able to hold the tissue against the housing. That would indicate dust/odor IN and clean air OUT....but this setting it is also the noisiest.Not sure if this will help someone, you can try the test yourself and see what you think.P.S. I use the #3 setting all day (it is doing a good job) and shut the unit off at nights."
4,Shuman shines,"If you were ever a part of the Karl Shuman Band phenomenon around the Morgantown area, you'll remember how fun listening to Karl was again. If you weren't a part of the small following, you'll find this CD to fall right in line with O.A.R. or very early years of Dave Matthews. Of course the production value isn't as grand as those two comparisons, but Karl's ability to write a roots-rock song is evident. Shuman shines on this last effort with more layers and better songwriting. Get yourself a piece of pie, go to your front porch and let this one play all the way through."
1,album was downer,"All the songs sound the same, big downer.....can't sing very wellhow does he have a album out?Or did his Dad pay for it?"
2,Defenitley not the best,OK to start off i upgraded my stock sound system 1995 jeep grand cherokee (infinity sound system). The stock sounded great but it was time to upgrade.i got these professionally installed and lets just say once they were finished they sounded terrible they were crackling every time i got above 15 on my stereo goes all the way up to 50. i thought that maby they just needed to break in. although 1 month later they got a little better go up to 25 now but after that they just start crackling. Please dont go off reviews on this item and save your money. i don't recommend these. (i always go off of reviews but these reviews i felt were misleading after i listened to these speakers myself) they do sound good and pure on low listening levels that's why i gave them 2 stars
4,Comparable to High End Speakers,"Not bad at all! for the amount of money you pay for these speakers, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. AMP is 100% required to hear the potential of these speakers. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars due to it lacking its natural bass, as a result Rock music doesn't sound too great which is not uncommon for aftermarket speakers... but for a 100 dollars what do you expect? lol"
5,speakers,"I was kind of hesitant at first, that is why i waited a year of use before i posed this review. I could not be happier. They sound clear, and the bass in them is great. I purchased these with Polk Audio DB6501 so the whole set is awesome. If you get these and complain about the bass or the sound being to crappy, replace your wires, that is what i did and they now sound great!!!"
5,excellent speakers! excellent value!,"this are with out a doubt my favorite speakers! i picked up a pair for under $90. and when properly installed and powered (crucial) they sound like a $300 set. i have installed the DB series in 4 different vehicles i have owned and never once had a problem. i highly recommend these. i was surprised at the amount of bass these pumped out, but like i said, being adequately powered is the trick to getting the great sound they are capable of."
4,Good sound,"They sound really good, come with all the wiring you'll need. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the crossover is a bit flimsy compared to others I've seen."
3,"Good lows and midrange, but...","I purchased these speakers about a year and a half ago and was at first amazed how better they sounded than the stock (but high end) ""DSP"" system in a 1998 BMW 528i. I also installed a new Pioneer AVIC-U310BT head unit,an Alpine MRP-F300 V power amplifier, and a 12"" sub in the back. Base and midrange are fantastic but there seems to be a slight resonance/peak in the tweeters that is apparent during the sounds/frequency close to the human voice ""s"" sound. Someone else mentioned this in a review and I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I understand. I'm keeping the installation but I am thinking about changing out the tweeters."
2,Disapointed,These speakers were highly rated and got great reviews. My experience was not good at all. I bought these along with Polk Audio 3-ways for my front doors. The cheaper 3ways sounded much better. The low end frequency is terrible and one just broke after 3 months. I had both sets hooked up to an Infinity Reference amp. Matter of fact boths sets of speakers have something wrong with them. I will never buy Polk Audio again...Disappointed!
4,Very good sound. If you don't go way too loud it has no distortion.,"I replaced my factory speaker on my 99 Nissan pathfinder for this component polks. And it sounds very good, Im using an alpine amp 75W RMS per channel. It sounds really good, I'v used polks before but never components speakers. If you want to inprove the sound in your car any aftermarket speaker will do it. But if you want something you can crank up the volume and still listening to music and not just a lot of noise this are the ones. I use this to listening Heavy Metal and by the time I get home (15 min) my ears are ringing like coming out of a concert! It feels like the music is not that loud because of all the power. But I can't even hear any noise from the road anymore.The only reason Im giving 4 stars out of 5 is because nothing is perfect in this world."
5,Amazing sound!,"I purchased these along with the 4x6 plate style speakers to replace a set of Walmart brand speakers in the front and pioneers in the back of my 2006 Silverado.They are driven by a Clarion head unit. Wow, is all I can say! These are so much better there is no comparison. I mounted the tweeters on the headboard where the post and windshield meet and hid the crossovers in the fuse compartment (drivers side) and wiring access port (passenger side). These speakers produce an amazing amount of bass with a nice thump and the tweeters provide crystal clear highs. All in all they are a great value!"
5,Fits in front of 05 Tacoma,"Used the TacoTunes adapters with these speakers. Fits pretty good, but be careful when placing the tweets. Not much room between them and the factory tweeter covers (for a non-JBL Tacoma). They sound pretty good, but now my stock stereo is the weak link...They are nice high quality units. I would buy again."
4,Nice sound,I have these installed in the front doors of my 2009 Maxima and powered by an aftermarket amp with 45 watts to each speaker. The sound is load and clear.
4,Excellent upper mid price components,"It is not the best (go with Focal for that), but bang for the buck is really up there."
5,"Great shipping, awesome policies and AWESOME customer service!","The packaging of these speakers is great and the quality is exactly what you would expect from Polk Audio.Great price and an awesome seller. They have awesome customer service, which unfortunately is a rarity these days.I look forward to purchasing more products from Central Buys to outfit my whole car stereo that I am the process of putting together."
1,Sounded great while they worked,Purchased a pair of db6501s and paid to have them installed. Worked for a week and then quit. I returned to the installer to find that the speaker that wasn't working had a voice coil that was not working.
4,"Mids not very responsive, tweeters crazy sensitive","Others had mentioned it before, the tweeters in this component set are extremely sensitive. Yes, they are! I'll add the mids don't respond in kind. A very subjective, un-scientific set of numbers, but it feels like raising the volume on the radio by 50% causes the mids to go up maybe 45% and the tweeters by 65%. Put even more power behind it and the tweeters really start screaming compared to the rest of the sound range. I don't know if it's the speaker design or the crossover design. Doing some tweaking with the radio's controls helps keep this under control. Otherwise the set sounds quite good for the price."
2,Crapped out,The tweeters eventually gave in after 2 months and made a scraping sound. I had it amped professionally as well. :(
2,Be careful what you read,You have to be careful with reviews I just learned the hard way I read every single review on this product what a let down I have these speakers powered by alpine amp garbage straight garbage if I knew I was throwing my money away I would have never bought these moral of the story go into a beat shop and listen to the speakers first. Then go home and order from amazon.
1,Bad experience,"Bought 2 pair of DB6501 for a Nissan Navara same as Nissan Frontier in the U.S. Had to exchange a pair of them for a DB691 since the front doors only allow you to fit 6x9's. Read so many great reviews on these speakers and was willing to have the same experience but seriously I am very dissapointed with the quality of sound from these speakers. The DB691 gives you a better listening experience than the Db6501. Great mids I cannot complain on that, but highs for the DB6501 are way too high it hurts your ears. Bass is just ok but not great. If you want Bass go for a subwoofer. Just a week ago one of the DB6501 is not working at all. Let's see if the warranty covers this deffective speaker?"
4,Don Williams Greatest,"A friend of mine was telling me about Don Williams. Once I heard some of the clips, just had to have this CD! He is smooth and mellow and his songs take me back to a time when things were simple. Good CD...give it a try!"
5,Don Williams Greatest Hits,It's Good I love his music I grew up listing to it and others like it I love the old country music
3,nice but,nice but the book is about 1/4 inch thick could be so much more in there and didnt need to be so sciency whos reading such dry crap
2,cabbage patch kid,"the boy doll was a great idea for my grandson. he didn't like it. he didn't like that the hair was dark brown, he has very light blonde hair. but doll didn't come in blonde. It was constructed well, the clothes were well made."
1,This is why Sabastian is not with Skid Row,"No wonder Skid row ventured on without the cocky front man. He is washed up and his voice cannot hold out. The bald guitar player just screamed into the microphone. Camera ok, video, ok, SB an ""F"" grade"
1,IF YOU ARE A TRUE SKID ROW FAN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED,"I've never visited a gay bar, but I can relate this performance to fit perfectly for one. Drag queen clothes (New York Dolls/Alice Cooper lame imitation) won't save the day in this poor musical attempt to revive Skid Row's good days. Maybe I'm too old for this, but excessive make up, glitter, and women's flashy clothes just don't cut it if wore by guys especially if the music doesn't ""make up"" for it or if it doesn't justify the effort. Tinkerbell guitarrist in a rock n' roll band? What the hell you need huge green butterfly wings for?Sebastian still has the energy to run all over the stage, but no signs of his once highly praised voice here.If you're buying it for the music, don't waste your $$$, if you're buying it for the extras...nothing really interesting either. This will be a one-time-watched dvd. A perfect dust-collector-item."
4,Bas Rules!!,"Being a HUGE Sebastian fan, I loved this!! Sebastian is hilarious and adorable! Watching this made me see him as very down to earth! Would love to party with this guy! The only thing I wasn't too fond of is the actual concert footage during the first half or so - what were these guys thinking when they got dressed???!! Kind of reminded me of a bad 1970's B movie. A head-to-toe silver, sequined ""Miami Vice"" suit does NOT belong on someone like Sebastian! I'm very surprised (with his usual image) that he actually dressed like that in public! And the BAD hairdo - whoa! But all the in-between footage, as well as his incredible, unmatched vocals, were awesome! (Make absolute sure to watch ""Bach in the Pit"" - I can watch that part over and over! Hilarious to see Sebastian trying to stay cool when you could see he was pretty freaked out!) Bottom line - I love it!"
2,Forever lame,Very disappointed with the audio/video quality of this DVD. Almost on the same level as a bootleg. I can't believe after all these years Sebastian Bach doesn't have better quality live footage to offer his fans.
1,Major Disappointment,"I just cannot believe that Sebastian Bach would allow a DVD of this quality to be sold in his name. After waiting so long for this DVD to come out, it is a dud. I love Sebastian Bach, but this DVD sucks. The sound quality is terrible. The five star reviews for this DVD are obviously placed here on Amazon by the company executives who manufactured and put out this sub-par piece of crap. Do not buy it, you will not be missing much. Check Ebay for mine and get a better deal..."
3,Good music Bad show,"This is a very good musical DVD, but the concert overall is very boring. First of all they are in halloween costumes making it harder for them to move around, so it gets boring to watch. Also it is at a bar or what looks like a bar so not a lot of space to move. The TV series stuff is funny but not great. The best part of this DVD is that there is no other place to see him perform live other then a show."
5,My Daughter is in Love,"This was a Yule girt for my daughter. On her 16th birthday I took her to see Skid Row in New Orleans. It was love at first sight. I also love the band, but for their music."
1,A total let down,"I have been a fan of Skid Row and espically Sebastian Bach for the last 15 years and was very excited to hear he was putting out a DVD. The DVD was a total let down. The concert footage sound is terrible, and the excerpts from his VH1 special were boring. I will forever be a fan, but don't bother with this one for your collection."
1,Disappointing,"I love Sebastian Bach's voice as heard on the Skid Row albums. But I was disappointed because he either lost the ability to reach the very high and clear notes or he never was able to and he simply used to use technology to make that sound possible. I don't know because I never saw a live Skid Row show in the past. By the way, what's with the costumes? He's a cool guy though.In regards to the DVD, I was disappointed at the poor sound and picture quality of the video (the concert clip)."
2,Vanishing Point,"OK but very thin on information. Could have been a one chapter book. Basically no one knows what ever became of Judge Crater. The author does a good job explaining the facts that we do know, and some of the possible outcomes, but there just isn't enough ""there"" there."
1,Barely Mentions Judge Crater,"Judge Crater left a New York restaurant on the evening of August 6, 1930 and was never seen again. A female friend who was there with him disappeared several weeks later. He'd been a judge for just three months. The problem with the book is the author is not interested in this mystery; he really wants to write about Tammany Hall and that's what he devotes almost the entire book to, apparently citing Crater only to lure in readers. I felt ripped off."
3,secret secret secret,"Joseph Force Crater was a New York City judge who vanished on the night of August 6, 1932. What happened to him after that remained a secret and mystery.To sum it up, if you like your mysteries to fit a very narrow mold; pass this one up. The rest of you; I think you can handle it."
3,use with caution,"I have used this book only once, as it s price puts it out of the reach not only of myself, but also of most institutional libraries in the UK. On that occasion I tested it against a known corpus of letter to The Times in 1866 on which I had worked, and which I had transcribed and published. I was alarmed to find that the Index picked up only about half of the letters. Hence my warning: use with care. It is beyond doubt that the rich material in the book will be useful to those wanting to get an initial lead on educational subjects. My concern is, does the poor success rate I found reflect that of the rest of the Index? A separate point: the Index has been long in the making. In future, i hope that such indexes will be either online or on CD Rom, where the search facilities are far superior to that in a printed volume."
5,Midnight Restoration at the End of the World,"Quite a wonderful read. John Ball describes the fiction exploits of a group of US Air Force personnel that discover an abandoned B-17E on the Greenland ice cap. Using their C-130, and a variety of excuses (and trying to keep their commanders ""officially"" in the dark), the manage to bring the B-17 back in pieces to restore it back to flying condition.This takes place at Thule AFB, Greenland, one of the mose desolate places on earth. The descriptions of life above the arctic circle are perticularly interesting.I recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in aviation."
3,A bit different,"Unfortunately, this album is not like any other Petty recording and in effect, not as good. He strays from his normal guitar-based melodies and fills the album with what seems like an attempt at some kind of synth-rock. A couple songs are worthy of recognition, like ""Runaway Trains"" and ""Jammin' Me,"" but overall I don't understand the direction of the album. Perhaps his 5 year struggle with alcohol and the previous album ""Southern Accents"" left him searching for a different taste. I don't know. I'm just glad that he got back to his normal self for his succeding albums. However, I must admit I do listen to the album often...call me a dedicated Petty fan."
3,"""Enough"" is enough","I'm a huge Tom Petty fan and I first bought this record right after its release in 1987 (I was still in college then, sigh). It didn't grab much then, and things haven't improved much since. ""Jammin' Me"" is a fine single, but the rest of the songs hardly measure up to ""Southern Accents,"" his previous and best album. Actually, what is most disappointing is Petty's pulling back from the creative breakthroughs he achieved on ""Accents"" and retreating to familiar musical territory. Overall, this is Petty's weakest album from the 1980s."
2,let me up i've had enough,"Everyband has a weak album here and there, and this one is Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers misstep. Let Me Up I've Had Enough is not an awful album buy any means, but it was the first Petty album in a long time not to spawn a hit single. The opener Jammin Me is a pretty good song cowritten with Bob Dylan. Let Me Up I've Had Enough is more for hardcore fans, casual fans should pass this one up."
3,The title track just does it,"I like the whole album, don't get me wrong, but the title track is just the best. One of the all-time best songs. Humorous yet serious, great lyrics. ""Who was that guy?"" Thanks to the band for a lot of good times and music"
4,Different is good,"The difference so often spoken about in this album is the ""live"" feel that is easily noticed in each of the songs. Petty and the Heartbreakers use this album as a chance to screw the production-is-god attitude of the rock world by simpy laying down great tracks. The album is brilliant, featuring songs such as ""Jammin' Me"" and my personal favorite ""My Life/Your World."" Indeed, Tom Petty is what is good about rock and roll today. As I write this review, I eagerly await the upcoming 1999 album. You see, the great thing about Tom Petty is that all of his albums have distinct differences. And different is good."
1,don't waste your money,I chose to do this over the brazillian blowout because the BB has formaldehyde and I didn't want to chance putting a cancer causing chemical on my hair so i decided to go with iso. my hair is curly and frizzy I went to a salon paid almost 200.00 to get it done and waited more than 24 hours before i got it wet at all. I actually waited almost 48 hours. I got up this morning and washed it with the moroccan oil brand shampoo and conditioner which I bought at the salon and partially blow dried my hair then sectioned it off and blow dried it the rest of the way. It looked good..... until I walked out the front door. The humidity was up and it felt like weather at the beach needless to say my hair frizzed up and tried to curl right now I look like buckwheat on a bad hair day. I know it's hard to judge by reviews especially when you want good results but ladies PLEASE DONT' WASTE YOUR MONEY. I wasted 285.73 to get this done at a salon and the 3 products i bought.
5,Another one-off masterpiece,"Norma Waterson has done it again! From the opening track, the haunting ""The Chaps of Cockaigny"" with masterful, laid-back accompanyment from husband Martin Carthy and others, to the final track, a jolly sing-along number ""My Flower, My Companion & Me"", this CD defies to be faulted. This CD is more folky than her previous offerings, all 12 tracks being traditional songs. Her distinctive voice, like no other in folk music, suits the material perfectly, conveying sadness or happiness when required. The backing musicians are sympathetic to the arrangements and are never obtrusive, leaving her voice firmly centre-stage,A must-have for lovers of traditional music."
4,An Awesome Compilation!!!,"I never realized how hilarious Christopher Walken was. He's awkward, but that's what makes him awesome! Of course this DVD has the infamous 'Cowbell' skit, The Continental, flirting with Mango, becoming a bad psychic, and much more! I highly recommend SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE: THE BEST OF CHRISTOPHER WALKEN!!!"
4,"Walken, fabulous as always","I saw him act on Broadway, 'A Behanding in Spokane'was the name of the play. A very black comedy. The SNL dvd gives us a little more of this incredible actor. Given his opportunity on this show he has continued to demonstrate some of his immense skills and more.If you like him, you'll like this product.If you dont know him give this a try there are some very clever and funny moments."
2,"Walken is great and rocks on SNL, but this DVD is a little disappointing","He is great and has some of the funniest skits on SNL, but the DVD is missing some of is best and sadly it isn't as good as I was expecting, it is decent but could have had more of his best routines from SNL."
2,Missing the best skit of all!!,"This doesnt have ""Connie Stinson Talks"" arguably the best of all Walken skits. What a shame!!"
4,Christopher Walken is great,"The only think this DVD could use is more extras. With the exception of that small consideration, it wasn't bad."
1,Sleeping Pill Substitute....,"5 Minutes Of Walken Iz Enuff........He Should Have Gone ""Over The Side"" On Wagner's Yacht Instead..!"
4,I've got a fever...,"And the only cure is MORE COWBELL!! I agree with some of the other reviewers here... They did leave out some classic sketches (rainbow head, for example). However, this dvd is still worth watching/owning for the classics that ARE included. I watched this by myself and couldn't help but laugh out loud during the ""Pranksters"" sketch. Christopher Walken is one of the masters when it comes to the deadpan straight man. I would have given it 5 stars if the sketches were a little more intelligently chosen. Worthwhile, but not perfect."
3,Not the Best of SNL Walken,"Christopher Walken is, in my opinion, one of the best hosts of SNL to grace the show. And this DVD doesn't do his appearances justice. He barely appears in the ""Colonel Angus"" skit, and the DVD extras aren't really worth looking at. It's also a let down to see so many skits cross over between the 25th anniversary edition & other ""best of"" discs. A show that's been on so long should put a little more into their realeases.All let-downs aside, there are hilarious moments in the Walken DVD that are worth watching. The ""Captain of the Boat"" was a favorite when I first saw it and I'm glad to see it here."
2,"Not the complete ""The Continental""","This is a poorly put together piece that fails to even include the best skits Christopher Walken did on SNL. Where are ALL the Continental skits? Enough said. This is a poor showing, and the makers should be embarassed."
3,A bit of alright and a bit of meh too...,"Hmmmmm what to say about SNL - Christopher Walken. Its funny. But not that funny. Would I recommend it to friends? No. Am I glad I bought it? Yes. If your a die hard Chris fan, then go for it. If not... Watch it on Youtube."
1,Quake,"Don't be fooled, the alleged reviewer from France is the author himself. If you read the authors writing and can understand what he is saying, this book is for you. If not and you want to learn self-defense, go to a school, you will not learn anything of value from these books.This author has harrased and slandered many martial artist because he believes he has invented ""the worlds perfect martial art"". Save your money!"
1,Poor packaging,"Packaging isn't strong enough to support weight of cards - blistering cracks, breaks open. Seen this at 2 retailers."
3,A Mixed Performer,"The good:Great zoom range. It's the only ZLR that goes as wide as 28mm (35mm equivalent).The bad:Very poor focusing, especially in low light.The ugly:More noise than you'd expect. A better alogarithm is need. A digital camera is only as good as its programming.The electronic viewfinder is virtually useless. The low pixel count and distorted viewfinder optics do it in."
4,"Horrid Autofocus/Noise, Otherwise Great!","I got this camera *years* ago! I still work with it occasionally, but back in it's hayday, I used it for bulb photography with lightning. The plus was using infinity and not autofocus (because the autofocus is horrendous), but the negatives were a maximum 60 second bulb and lots of noise. Of course, back when this camera was $1,000+, it was pretty good. Still, in the daylight it takes beautifully vivid photos. I upgraded the firmware on it just before Konica halted the production of all cameras, which was supposed to fix the autofocus, but didn't make any difference to me. It's been through rain, snow and heat and has still held up. She's probably been through at least 10,000 pictures (lots of lightning photos that contained no lightning, probably every 95 in 100 were deleted). Very robust. Still gets four stars despite it's problems. I'll keep it til it dies!"
1,ITEM DID NOT WORK,"I GAVE THIS ITEM AS A GIFT.I BOUGHT IT 30 DAYS OR SO BEFORE I NEEDED IT. GOT WORD THAT IT WAS DEFECTIVE. I EMAILED THE COMPANY THROUGH AMAZON WITH NO RESPONSE SO I CALLED THE COMPANY AND LEFT A MESSAGE, NO RESPONSE. BE CAREFUL."
3,SpaRitual Polish,The SpaRitual Nail Lacquer color The Giving Tree is a fabulous fall/winter lacquer. The polish went on easily and smoothly and stayed beautifully for the week. I had tried the color while staying at the Canyon Ranch Spa and loved it. I'm so glad I was able to purchase it through Amazon.
4,Very light pink,"Ive used this nail polish product before, and fell in love with it the first time. I definitely reccomend this color if you are looking for a very light pink or almost white color."
4,Quality polish.,I found Spa Ritual while on a cruise on Regent Seven Seas. It's one of the new less toxic brands of polish. Now it's all I buy!
1,Does not last,"Okay, the concept of having a toluene free nail product is great, but my experience in the last two weeks is horrible! Fresh application of two coats on clean, well manicured, short nails & a day or two later, the edges begin peeling off from the front. The first time this happened, I experimented with lifting one bit of the tip of a nail, then grasping with two fingers--POP, the whole surface came off. Pretty much of a clean sweep: all ten nails, with a random speck still clinging. Guess I don't need nail polish remover!Now I'm on my second application and the same thing is starting to happen.This is going back to the store..."
1,Rubbed off my toe nail!,I had a pedicure 1.5 weeks ago with this product. Today I looked at my big toenail and the product had rubbed right off. I had worn shoes without socks and had walked quickly to the train station on a hot day. I guess that was enough to take it right off. I have a wonderful pedicurist who does fashion shoots and she did a wonderful job which was ruined because of the quality of this product. . I would avoid using this product again except that my pedicurist likes vegan products and doesn't have too many other choices. I guess I will have to bring my own from now on if I want something that sticks. I was planning on wearing sandals tomorrow but won't be able to show my toes!
4,SpaRitual Nail Lacquer,"I originally tried these out at a spa in Maryland and was very impressed with the quality and appeared to last longer and chip less than other nail polishes. The shipper was prompt and got my order correct- I ordered 4 nail polishes. Be aware the swatches of colors may be a little off. Elixir was definitely more purple than pink. Regardless, I think you probably can't go wrong with most shades. I would purchase more."
2,Chipped almost right away,"Like another user, I paid $50 for a manicure and absolutely loved the color. Even with a top and base coat, this stuff started chipping the third day. It was a thoroughly sad moment--$25 for each day of wear."
2,Can't keep it on!,"After a $55.00 professional manicure, this polish started to peel off after two days. Top and base coats were used; I'm partially disabled, so use my hands very little. The first time I applied this product was without the base and top coats,and the whole nail color surface just slid right off! If you are going to try it, get the small bottle because it also gets tacky very quickly. And what on earth is the numerology bit? Pagan nail polish?? Nice assortment of colors, but dry in slightly different hues and tones, so try a sample on first."
3,Might buy again,"I looked everywhere for this color for a Halloween party & it was perfect for that use. I kind of hate the color otherwise & the polish does chip easily if you actually use your hands (I'm not a ""girly girl"" so I have yet to find any nail polish besides ""sinful colors"" that DOESN'T chip w/normal wear w/in a day or 2). It's average..but they do have more color options than I've found elsewhere."
3,satisfied,"I bought 2 of these enclosures one for me, and one for my girlfriend. they both work fine. however the back end of one has fallen off. it still works, but that did disappoint me, that aside at that price the enclosures are great."
5,Tough and reliable,"An excellent case. I have had few problems with this case and I have taken it through the wringer in while using it. It has survived several falls, both with and without a hard drive, been used in 120+F degree environments, been used at below 20F, been jarred and shaken during travel and use. I have only noticed one time that the back plastic cover came loose after a fall but all it took was pressing it back in place and it was as good as new. The only thing I would change would be to change the ends to metal instead of plastic and make both the front and back screw on instead of just the front."
4,Works great,"This power supply works great, maybe even better than the original. Installation was basically easy, computer started right up after installation."
5,Very Good Cymbal!!,"I own this cymbal .Very Sharp attack with no sustain.Great for fills.Price is great for a 16"".Buy it, you'll be happy you did!"
5,One of their best albums ever,"The Fall must have over thirty albums out now and I have plenty of those. When I got this album I was just blown away - even though I'm quite spoiled with what I have already. This is one of the toughest records they ever made. Incredibly intense. The drum and synth sounds are incredibly tight. And Mark E Smith is ranting in an amazing fashion. If you know some of the older albums: The Unutterable sounds like the tougher stuff on ""Light User Syndrome"". For instance, ""Das Vulture"" could be a song from this album."
3,Varied Fall,"I agree with the previous review, that this album suffers from being ""Pro-Tooled"" a little too much, and a bit too long that some tracks appear as ""filler."" What's interesting, is this album to my ears at least sounds in some parts influenced by the whole down tempo (Massive Attack's ""Mezzanine"" comes to mind on some of the tracks) and acid jazz/ retro scenes (especially the track ""Pumpkin Soup and Mashed Potatoes""). Not a bad album by The Fall, but not the greatest, but pretty all over the place genre wise. Buy ""The Marshall Suite,"" inaccurately described by a viewer as being ""mediocre,"" it's far from it, and way more delightful than this one."
3,"Very Good, but...","I bought this book personally from Walkin' Jim after he performed an excellent show at the elementary school where I teach. His book really draws you into the journey and I enjoyed the parts where he describes his trek in the wilderness. I consider myself an environmentalist, but I think man can coexist with the environment. In the book Jim considers burning down an abandoned horse camp and throwing a rock at a passing helicopter. He often comes across as an elitist. The wilderness is there for him to enjoy, but no one else. Maybe I took these passages wrong, but they did tend to put me off. The book is worth reading...if you can get past his lectures on the evils of humankind."
3,I found the works uneven,"A virtuoso piano concerto in the LARGE mould, I enjoyed the Corigliano a lot. Excellent playing and imaginative use of the instrument, make this an excelent choice if you are fond of Concerti like Britten or Barber - allthough this work has less of the latter's ""Neo-Romantic leanings"" (whatever exactly they may be). I am still trying to figure out the other works by Ticheli. I was listening to it on the freeway and thinking ""some of this is so ugly"". Perhaps I missed the point. Clever and virtuoso it surely is, but sitting here I can not recall a single texture or melody, and would not recognise it if you played it for me now. Pity, since this is theonly recording of the Concerto I have seen recently."
5,Good start for new parents,"This DVD was a great purchase. I am a soon to be first-time mom and have ordered a handful of dvds and books on newborn and baby care. If you were to choose between this DVD and Bringing Baby Home (The Ultimate Baby Care DVD )definitely go for this one!This DVD focused more on safety tips for newborn care, which included a lot of information I truly had not known before and that other DVD's do not mention. I cannot list them all here, just look at the Product Description, it lists all the info you should expect to learn about.The video is short compared to others, but it focuses on what is necessary and does not drag on with interviews and unnecessary info."
2,Lacks depth,"While it has a few interesting advises, most of them are common sense, even for us who are first time parents. For instance, everyone knows that you have to remove the plastic in which a new mattress is packed.It also lacks depth in the topics it covers. For example, it only spends a few seconds on breastfeeding, while we were expecting to learn breastfeeding positions, how to know when your baby has had enough milk, and how to burp the baby.It wasn't worth the money for us."
3,"Ok, but not a must.","This item does have some valuable information, but it isn't a must have. You can learn much more from simply reading what to expect, or other similar parenting books. Not really worth the money or time."
5,Great Resource,As a school psychologist I do some counseling with children and cognitive behavior theory is something I greatly utilze in practice. This is a great resource to work with different age groups and I have even given this to a collegue when she began a slightly new career venture. She also thinks it comes in handy in practice.
5,Great Resource,"This is a wonderful resource for practitioners utilizing cognitive therapy with children/adolescents. There are many activities that can be used in individual or group sessions. I also highly recommended their other book, Cognitive Therapy Techniques for Children and Adolescents: Tools for Enhancing Practice."
4,Perfect...perfectly evil,"This book is one of those R.L. Stine books that aren't terrible and aren't perfect. A lot of parts were really stupid and boring. But towards the end, the book started to get much better. It has a HUGE surprise. There's only one problem with the end--it has a terrible epilouge."
3,R.L. Stine?,"I am a 57-year-old man who has been reading and writing young adult novels for many years. ""The Perfect Date"" has the typical R.L. Stine zippy style, but out of all the books of his that I have read, this is the most unusual. It is almost as if it was written by a different person.If you look closely, Stine's books are mysteries with logical explanations (even his Super Thrillers fall into this category.) ""The Perfect Date"" is the only book of Stine's that I have read that is pure supernatural horror. I have been viewing and reviewing horror films for the last seven years, but have not come across anything that has raised such hackles as ""The Perfect Date."""
5,Perfect Date,"This was an interesting book it came highly recomended and it was a good read, I would recomend this one for lesure reading."
3,It was okay.,Perfect Date was okay. It wasn't the best R. L. Stine book I've Ever read. But I still recomend it.
3,The Perfect Book.......NOT!,"When I found this book, I HAD to get becasue in 4th grade, my friend had read it and said it was SOOOO good...so I was really happy when I found it and bought it. I guess I'm quite a 'gore' (gore as in scary, nasty stuff, NOT al gore) fan, so I liked the first chapter. But then the book kinda got slow. And I hate it when they involve stuff about houses and how ""someone doesn't live here"" or ""I can't find the house!"" [like in IN TOO DEEP] But the ending WAS cool!*sparkle*"
2,Confusing book,"Eduardo Andres Brugal K.book reviewThe perfect date by R.L stine is a hartstabing story about a boy that has two girlfriends.Random accidents happen each time he is around the newest girlfriend.if you like drama,spooky stories and romance this is a book for you.Or if you are a fan of R.L stine you will simply enjoy this book.This book includs death and therfore migth not be for all readers.I recomend this book for ages 10 and up.Its a slow pased romance with a scary mistery.If you like frigthnig books this is a book for you.If you are a a die-hard fan of romance accidents book this story is for you.I preffer information-based books about the universe, but if you are a sirious R.L stine fan, you will enjoy it!"
3,horrible ending,"This was, in my opinion the best fear street book ever, but I read the ending, and it was so unrealistic. It was a huge let down. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes fear street books, it will change your outlook on the whole series, and it is a waste of your time."
2,Don't Believe What's Pictured,"This book is tiny. The facts contained are very sparse in detail. It's great if all you want is an author's name, birth date and a listing of one or two of their works. However, you can get all of this information (actually a little more) from just a regular World Almanac. After I received my copy I felt a bit cheated. From the picture offering you'd think everything you ever wanted to know about literature was enclosed, but believe me it isn't."
1,Impossible!,"I bought this game used at Gamestop but it sure looked like it was taking me to level 1 when I tried playing it (for weeks) and never could pass the first level. All I could do was just walk around this industrial world and try to figure out what in the world I was supposed to do. Many times I would literally not be able to jump up to where I thought the game should take me somewhere. It made no sense. I kept trying it and trying. The graphics were great, but I thought it was a very dumb game if it didn't tell me at all how in the world you were supposed to play it. Now I know why the former owner traded it in! I traded it in for a better game after being dissappointed with no improvement. And I'm 27 and have played all my life, so I'm not a newbie at the gaming world. Don't buy it. It's a dissappointment!"
4,One of my favorites,Wonderful book and a good movie. A love story set during the war. Great for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
5,It is working great in our barn!,"We have only had this fan for about a month but so far we are very pleased with it. We use a fan in our barn to give the horses a cool place to come into during really hot days (of which we are having many so far this summer!). For years we used an inexpensive box fan that we picked up a big name home improvement store. That worked fine, but this spring it shorted out. Fortunately we were in the barn when it happened and we unplugged it quickly, but it could have caused a fire. We know that all the dust that is inherent in a barn was responsible, so we did the right thing and bought a fan with a sealed motor. We hung this new fan from the rafters in the barn where it is out of the way but it is low enough for us to reach up and adjust the angle and pull on the chain. It is quiet and moves a lot of air."
1,Industrial grade? No way,"I have 2 of these fans and after 1 1/2 years they both squeak when running.Air King has really gotten cheap too, the 3 year warranty is a thing of the past.It is now only a 1 year warranty."
4,Very satisfied,We are happy with this wall mount. Sturdier than most. We use it in a place of business and have had many compliments on our choice. Came very fast in the mail as well. Would recommend.
5,Peter & Rina finally tie the Knot!,"What a ""Honeymoon"", there doesn't seem anything that doesn't happen to the New Mr.& Mrs. Decker. Wonderful fast read, great insight on the Jewish Orthodox community. Peter is confronted by his on heritage & Rina is a true fiesty heroine with a mind of her own. Sadly this book shows no one is immune to the trouble of your society & it touches even the most protected children."
3,ok,OK - but language is not good. No longer reading this series. Liked the characters. Just did not enjoy it.
2,Boring...,"I was really excited to read this book. I had heard about the series. Now, I'm just hoping this is NOT like the other books in the series. The story is so slow. In a review some lady said she stayed up all night to finish it...either she made a mistake about what book she was reading, or she's just an insomniac! The story is boring and, except maybe for Peter Decker, the characters are cardboard. The worst, though, is the plodding narrative. I suggest you try reading another book in this series. I may,then again, I may be done with Ms. Kellerman."
5,Day of Atonement,I'm a real Faye Kellerman fan. Good suspence and an insight into jewish customs.Decker/Lazarus have a great thing going.
4,Very Shocking and Full of Suspense,"It is 10:00 pm on a Sunday eveing and I have just finished the last page of ""Day of Atonement."" I finished the book with a large smile on my face and I said to my wife, ""Don't you just love it when you come to the end of an excellent book.""The book was extremely exciting...quite a page turner. We join Peter and Rina in Brooklyn while they are celebrating their honeymoon. They are visiting Rina's ex-in-laws during the holidays of Rosh HaShanah. During the holidays a young man turns up missing and Decker starts the trial to find him.Unfortunatley, the young man, Noam, has crossed paths with a psychopath who gets immense joys from gutting live fish. Will Decker rescue him in time?The book is well worth the time spent reading it...you will come away from it with a smile on your face as well. PLUS, get some tissues for the last chapter...it is joyously sad."
2,YAWN...,"This 4th in the series of Decker and Lazarus is weighed down by Kellerman's insistence on focusing once again on Jewish tradition and its place in the newlywed's lives. While Kellerman has entertained in the previous three novels, in spite of this what I consider weakness, this novel is just not exciting. The entire middle is spent interviewing and moaning over Noam's disappearance, and of course, more Jewish lore and tradition that has become redundant and plot-suffocation. Faye needs to adopt more of her husband Jonathan's panache for good plots and a faster pace. This one bogs down and its resolution is unsatisfying. I've obtained her whole series and plan to continue to read, I just hope in the future books, she makes plot, suspense and intrigue more important than the obvious love she has for her family tradition. And hopefully Peter and Rina will start treating each other as adults rather than spoiled children trying to outdo each other.NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU'RE INTO THE SERIES."
1,Horrible Condition,"This book was supposed to be in good condition. It was so poor, I threw it away upon receipt. The cover was folded, ripped and smuged, the pages were dog-eared and some torn, the entire book had turned yellow as if it had laid in the sun and elements for months. Worst purchase I have ever received in my life. I would not purchase from this vendor again and would recommend that no one else does either."
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is an edited book with different authors contributing an article each. Thus these is no coherency. It seems that the editor had asked each contributing author to just give an article about his or her telescope making experience. Thus all the chapters are separate entities without any cross-references (between chapters). Finally they do not go in any detail what so ever. It is more like a ""1001 Project Book"" which claims that (after reading the book) you can do every thing from repairing cars, TVs, VCR, DVDs to building an airplane, except that the book only devote half a page to all the 1001 projects. You just cannot make a telescope by reading this book (unless you already know how to make one).BTW: you can find more information on the web than what this book delivers. I am just glad that I borrowed it from the library, and did not buy it."
2,I expected a bit more...,"If you want to build your own mirror and telescope step-by-step with mirror grinding techniques you'll need another book. This book shows how the user should build a telescope but don't explains in details how the user can achieve such results. This book is good for someone which needs know a bit more about telescope's mounting and projects and had built their telescope already. You can use it as a manual, getting useful tips with it. :-/"
4,I was there!!,"Hey, I don't know what this CD sounds like to most people, but when I listen to it I remember the sun beating down on all of us as we stood, 30,000 people, before the Lord from 9 am till late at night, worshipping, praying, and seeking His face. This CD is a snibbet of all that happened there at OneDay03 on 5/27/03 in TX. It was a memory well worth having, and I'm totally happy that anyone who WASN't there could pick up this CD and taste that worship with those of us who were."
5,One of the best worship cd's available,"The Passion cd's keep raising the bar for Christian praise and worship music. The 13 songs recorded live on this cd project a spiritual earnestness that only comes by much prayer prior to the music being played and sung. Passion's music, more than any other I think, draws one into the spirit of Worship and turns one's focus to God.With several leaders singing the songs, there is not a focus on any person or star. The focus of the cd is on the Lord. The songs offer great upbeat music and variety. They keep the listener focused on the message. You can really experience the excitement of that ""one-day"" event where this was recorded.I have four Passion cd's, and I think this one rates at the top. It is like a great book that I can't put down. I want to continually listen to it and get caught up in the Praise that glorifies Jesus.Thanks and congratulations to the Passion team that comes together each year to bless us with wonderful music."
3,"Decent passion album, not as strong as previous ones","As a big fan of the previous Passion albums, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. The line-up of artists is great - David Crowder Band, Matt Redman, and Charlie Hall to name a few. But, the songs just are not that strong.I like the David Crowder Band songs, and a few of the slower ones. But, other than that most of the album falls flat for me. The female vocalists oversing their songs, and even one of my favorite Matt Redman songs, ""Blessed Be the Name of the Lord"" is not that great.Simply put, I would not recommend this Passion cd. The earlier ones are better. If you are new to the Passion movement, start with something like ""Our love is loud"" instead of this one. Hopefully, the next release is better."
2,"Major disappointment, worship Passion album to date","I've been a fan of the Passion movement and their CDs for a while now, but this album was a major disappointment. It starts out with a great song, O Praise Him, by David Crowder Band. But it just goes downhill from there. The rest of the songs are mediocre; I think one of the problems is that they tried to get as many different worship leaders' songs on one CD. They should get rid of that Charlie Hall dude because his songs are terrible. Matt Redman's rendition of O Come Let Us Adore Him was not particularly creative.I would recommend the latest David Crowder Band album, Illuminate, instead."
5,Not his best efforts...,I was not a fan of this one enough to give it more than a two star review and a sentence for a critic. I'd like a refund. Instead - I sold it on eBay for half my money back. I accidentally gave th9is one 5 stars.
1,And Nobody Got Hurt!,"I have not received this book yet!!!!! I tried to tracked the book using the tracking number, but all it said was that the book was delivered. The United States Post Office says that they received a notice from Amazon that an item will be delivered, but that the item has not arrived yet. I looked all over the Amazon website to help find my book, but could not find ant help."
4,"Good,","This book is a very interesting and funny bunch of sports stories. There is a story about a animal running onto a college football game and scoring a winning touchdown! There's a story about a guy who ran through a plywood wall to get a baseball! There are a great amount of stories sure to crack you up! My only problem is that they don't have any stories about soccer. If you like sports, you should definitely buy this book!"
1,RIPPED OFF,I purchased three of these to give to my grandsons and we were not happy with them. We love Len Berman's spots on TV so we thought the books would be entertaining gifts. They are dull and printed on inexpensive newsprint type paper with no coloful illustrations. The stories are tedious and a few drawings in vivid colors might have perked them up. I would not recommend this book. Sorry Len and say hello to Shelly.
2,quality,Picture quality not the best for the vampire bat. Old movies fromUniversal and Warner studios tend on average to have excellent picture quality.
1,HP-40 compatible ink cartridge,"I bought 2 cartrisges at $20 each, they are not even worth 2c both together. After 1 sheet of plotting, the brand new cartridge started acting as if it's empty, missing line, shading etc. I have no choice but to thow away both cartridges and the $40 that I paid for them. I recommend Amazon.com to stop selling a defective item like this one. Absolutely piece of junk."
4,VIDEO,"I love Sommore, and boy did she bring it on this one. She continues to wow, DVD came on time and had no issues."
1,Not a fan!!!!,I actually ordered this dvd for my mom....i like sommore but i'm not a fan at all. I'd rather watch Bernie Mac who makes me laugh so hard i cry. Miss you Bernie!!!!! R.I.P!!!!
4,All That,She has always been funny but this one was over the top! Keep up the good work Sommore! I'll always buy her comedy movies
4,There's Only One Sommore,"I didn't have to preview the DVD because after all, it was Sommore, one of the original Queens of Comedy. I make it a point to check out her show whenever she comes to my area. She's had funnier rooutines but this DVD has its moments. The funniest bit is when she's talking about partying with her hood girls and the girls from the office. That was hillarious. I hope she puts out another one soon. All in all it's entertaining, IT'S SOMOORE!"
5,Funny!,"I have never laughed so much in my life. I could not stop laughing. I had a really bad week and this was exactly what I needed. This was food for my soul. I will watch this again and again, too funny. Sommore you are so crazy, LOL."
3,Its a good performane,"I bought this movies thinking it was a movies but it was actually a stand up comedy kind of things,but she is funny so it was worth watching and buying."
1,Money well spent,"Sommore can do no wrong, her humor is reality based which makes it all the more relatable.this dvd is your ticket to a very entertaining evening at home...make sure the kids are asleepshe is very ""real"" in her delivery."
1,Too Foul to be Funny,This comedy act would have been a lot more funny without the massive amount of profanity. I should have kept my money.
5,SOME More!,"Ms. Sommore, never disappoints. This is a MUST have ... I laffed so hard until I was crying. She is and always will be my favorite ""queen""."
4,Sommore: The Queen Stands Alone,"Very good show , on the mOney Sommore is one of the best stand ups out today Highly recommended !!! i Could'nt stop laughin"
3,A little too simplistic,"This is a great book for small children, but not for anyone who cares to really learn Chinese. It is very interesting with some simple words and builds both characters and sentences. I thought is was helpful in gaining an understanding of how the language works and how characters are related. My biggest complaint is only the very small size and the small number of words you actually learn. If you want to get a flavor of Chinese and learn about 50 words, it's OK; for anything more serious, it is too simple."
5,BORDERLINE/ CONWAY TWITTY,"VERY HARD TO FIND,IF YOU CHECK OUT THE TRACKS YOU'LL SEE IT HAS A COUPLE SONGS YOU WON'T FIND ON ANY OF HIS OTHER RECORDING: FOR INSTANCE, BORDERLINE, SNAKE BOOT, EVERYBODY NEEDS A HERO, & FIFTEEN TO FORTY THREE, NOT ENOUGH LOVE TO GO AROUND, I'M FOR A WHILE. THIS IS TRULY A RARE FIND, & WORTH EVERY CENT YOU PAY. I GOT LUCKY & FOUND SOMEONE WHO HAD IT, BUT NOT WITHOUT A LOT OF SEARCHING. SEE IT! BUY IT!TRUST ME IF YOU ARE A CONWAY TWITTY LOVER, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE!!! I'D RATE IT RIGHT TO THE TOP, FOR ANY COLLECTOR."
3,Grandmas fire went out!!,"For all the hype on this book I expected more. there were things that were quite interesting, but this didn't cover up the things that weren't. If you are a beginner at do things for yourself then you will like this book....Ken"
4,Goes up. Goes down.,Works well. I assume its reading is representative of the temperatures. Color is not too bright and offensive. Looks good on black stove. You sometimes have to tap it to get it to give current temperature as it occasionally gets a bit hung up on its way up. Not the end of the world.
5,Fast shipping- Exactly as pictured,Works great. I have this on my stovepipe and it's really been helpful in showing us where the perfect zone is for our fire. It was packaged nicely. It doesn't slide down the stovepipe no matter how hot it gets.
5,Pretty cool!,"I honestly wasn't sure where the story as going at first, but it was still interesting, so I kept reading, and I ended up totally loving it in the end. It kind of all came together. I loved the spider creatures, and I loved the little RPG Travis and his friends had going. It was neat, and added more humor. Something I love about both the show and the books so far is the great humor they have going, without turning it into a sitcom, that is. Awesome book!"
1,"Too much about Fantasy Role Playing, not enough REAL action.","I was really looking forward to reading a book about the new enterprise series but this book did not live up to my expectations. The subplot about Ensign Cutler's role-playing game just went on and on... (As a former gamer, I think playing a rpg is one thing... Reading about it for chapters on end didn't do it for me). Especially when there are so many MORE exciting things going down on the 'new' enterprise. While the writing wasn't bad, I didn't find the authors holding my interest like they should. Definately made me regret plunking down $X."
2,Too early,"Pretty much wound up hating it because it seemed way too rushed to market. As others have pointed out, the author and publisher should have waited to see where Braga and co. were going to take the characters. Once you've seen how the series progresses on screen, the characterizations in this book are off the mark."
4,I liked it!,I thought the book was good. We see characters that are not a major part of the TV series developed a bit more and come to understand that humanity has far to go in trying to understand and sort out the intentions of an alien race. Things are not always what they appear on the outside.
2,Jumped on the bandwagon too soon,"It would appear this novel was ""thrown together"" way too fast. Written in a few months and not well thought out. Probably every Trek writer wanted to be the one to write the first ""Enterprise"" book... so it was a race. As you can see, the editor at Pocket Books himself (Smith) published this, his own book, so it doesn't have to be good and reach the usual level of excellence. Besides that, and most importantly, we don't know enough about the Enterprise characters indepth just yet (or what kind of games they play in their future world), nor do we ""love"" them in that special way that must be earned. Talk about a book that's ""ahead of its time""."
3,Should have waited a while,"You can tell that this story was written very early during the first season. In the novel, the characters of Archer, T'Pol and Hoshi feel like they are based solely on the pilot episode. Archer and T'Pol actively distrust each other and there is no indication of them trying to form even a working relationship, let alone anything more personal. Hoshi is portrayed as being afraid of everything -- including elements of the game they are playing. There is no sign of Hoshi trying to come to grips and overcome those fears.If you don't worry too much about the characterizations, the plot and feel of the story itself is good. The idea of an RPG session running in parallel with the main plot of the story worked well. This really would have been a much better novel if it had come out later, after the authors had the chance to get to know the characters they were writing about."
3,Good start to the series,"I was looking forward to this series coming out in books. I liked the way the author picked an ensign as the lead character and how the whole crew seemed from her perspective.Also good insight into how the ""prime directive"" may have (yet to)come about. About the only thing I'd cut down on is the Role Playing Game, but you can tell the authors are into that type of thing.Definitely worth the read, and looking for more"
5,Movie buff,"I enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees, but The Family Stone is one of my favorites. It's a great ensemble cast with a funny and heartwarming story. It's one I try to watch every Christmas season."
1,What is this movie about,"Is it impossible for Amazon to figure out that we need to know what movies are about if we are going to purchase them. They finally figured it out re books, which is why I have been buying more. Who buys a movie from just the picture and names of actors. There is no rating system, no trailer, nothing a consumer would need to know to make the purchase. You lose Amazon! I am going somewhere else for movies!! There is NO REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE at AMAZON!!! Automation only goes so far! If you are too big to provide real service. You are too big for my money."
4,"Whoa, old guys truly can rock","Who says old guys can't rock? Heck, not me. This band was a classic 80s rockin one but in the mid to late 90s they slowed down and went on this streak of ""wow we suck""...But now...whoa! Back to the old days Schlitt! And looks who's back...What? Did you say Bob Hartman on guitars? Yes this is truly a great album despite a few vocal clich's but hey...theyre old guys"
4,"Great, but not memorable.","I enjoy the thrashing sounds of this disc, but this is less of a product of Petra and more like the product of Petra hiring the Newsboys to produce their album. One song, ""Woulda Coulda Shoulda,"" completely bears the makings of a Newsboys song. It is interesting to see what happens when Peter Furler gives Petra ""cool"" lessons and shows them how to completely ditch all the musical styles they once knew. Jekyll and Hyde is interesting, but not worthy of being Petra's final album."
3,"Good, but not great","This cd marks a return to rock for Petra. Unfortunately, it's also quite short, and the lyrics are definitely not Bob's strongest. Indeed, the themes are often a subpar rehash of material that Bob has written before in a far more palatable way.That said, ""Jekyll & Hyde"" just plain rocks, ""Test of Time"" is a really fun song, and there are some really fun riffs on this album.Too bad that the songs all sound too similar, the lyrical content isn't as strong as previous efforts, and the album is too short. Otherwise it would have been a clear winner."
5,Petra,"This album is for all ages. Either you are back in the 1970's, where all those good bands like Aerosmith played. Or maybe you like hard rock of today. This album is for you. Look at these postings, and a 5-star rating must tell you something about this album."
2,Ehhh....,"Not bad. But not particularly good, either. Petra has always been far too much of a contemporary band. They haven't ceased with their bandwagon jumping yet. This isn't nu-metal by any means, but it is raw as all hell (pardon the pun). And that isn't always a good thing. Back in the 80's these guys had slick production, a good drummer, and great hooks. Petra followed the arena rock/Def Leppard movement. Just an album ago, they were onto the U2-train. Sorry to say, there isn't a whole lot of great Christian music out there. A finished product should be a finished product. There's too much filler on 'Jeckyll & Hyde'. Artists first must sketch before they complete their paintings. Petra, you gave us your sketches. Please try better next time and paint us the entire picture. 'Jekyll & Hyde' really is about as overhyped as Dokken's 'Erase The Slate' with their so-called return to form."
4,"Music Good, Disc Bad","This is my first Petra CD and I love it! I think I'll look into buying more of their albums.At least that's what I'd say if this CD wasn't defective. The distributing label for INPOP is EMI. The latter saw fit to deposit deliberate errors on this CD to discourage ilegal copying. The problem is that it also infringes on fair use. I can't play this CD in ANY computer. I normally rip all of my CDs and encode to Ogg Vorbis format, but have yet to succeed with this disc.Making copies for your own personal use is NOT illegal. It's not like I can listen to more than one copy at a time, and I don't share copyrighted music with others.Bottom line? If you intend to listen to this CD in stereo component or portable players only, get it. It's great music. If you want to listen to it anywhere else, and choose to gamble on this disc, pick up a copy of Exact Audio Copy and pray that it works."
2,Nothing New,"I've always been a huge Petra Fan from the days of This Means War and on. Yeah we had to suffer through a couple bad albums like Wake up Call and God Fixation, but overall they have put out stuff that I liked alot. Jekyll and Hyde is nothing new to Petra fans. Its a whopping 31 min disc with 10 three minute tracks. It seems to me that Hartman and the rest of Petra realized that record sales were not quite what they used to be so they figured they would throw together a heavy rock album and kick it out to boost sales. THere's nothing new or original in the tracks just ur basic verse chorus, 2nd verse chorus, end of song. When I listen to music I want to enjoy it, have it become and emotional experience with me. This doesnt quite cut it."
5,Minibeam Flashlight,"The minibeam flshlight is great! It is very bright, and it really does FLOAT I would recomend it to anyone who spends time in the outdoors. SUPER product at a resonable price."
3,Obviously written before the release of the movie,"This book was good for what it was--an adaptation of a movie script, aimed at kids. However, it was clearly adapted from an early version of the script--written before the movie was fully cast. Much of the storyline does not conform to the movie, and there are several major incongruities (such as a character played by Thomas Haden Church declaring himself to be the tallest man in a group which contains Abraham Benrubi and Greg Cruttwell).Overall, it's a cute little book. But (and I never thought I'd say this) I'd rather watch the movie."
1,don't waste your money,"The strings are not worth buying, I put them on, they were off in a week. D'Addario exp110's are my strings of choice."
2,Horrible tone,"Looks cool at first... sounds very dull and bland, feels very gross like playing on corroded strings. black coating doesn't last long. If you're trying to look cool with a blacked out guitar I guess it does that at the cost of tonality and playability. I've played all kinds of coated strings and these are by far the worst I've ever seen, and I'm a DR fan."
5,great strings,I think these strings are great but what do I know Im a beginner at playing I would recommend them.
3,good selection,"I am an ""Old Bird"" so maybe my comments aren't worth a hill of beans. Be that as it may. There were enough ""Goodies"" in here for me to recommend it (especially for the price)."
1,Maas products over rated,"I applied, I scrubbed, I buffed and nothing. Didn't have any effect on the white crusty hard water stains. Then I accidentally spilled vinegar on them. Voila! Stains gone. Sink looks like new. I spent $56 on useless products and found dirt cheap vinegar to work best. Don't waste your money."
1,Amazon and MAAS Uncooperative,"I received a defective item, very poorly packaged, and after three communications sent to Amazon and two to MAAS, I still have not had the problem resolved. Amazon does not seem to have a satisfactory method for communicating problems to Customer Service. I have communicated with the manufacturer and they say they are not responsible for their defective product--Amazon is. Also in contacting the manufacturer I discovered that Amazon charges almost twice as much for the same product as the manufacturer MAAS. Apparently Amazon is no longer interested in my business or Amazon would try to resolve the problem particularly since Amazon overcharged me for this product. I should not have to take the time to return the Chrome Cleaner when all I need is a spray mechanism that works. If I don't receive the working spray mechanism very soon, you will have lost me as a steady customer and of course I will never purchase from Amazon or MAAS again."
3,Not enthused,"Not enthused. I can't decide how many stars to give. It's not one, two, four or five stars, so that leaves three stars.Add bright-yellow to high-contrast ""dark"" black text and you get medium-contrast medium-green text. The yellow makes the contrast between the text and white background LESS--not good. ""No color"" would be better. OR, a better idea would be a thin black line which would underline the text rather than cover it.I like the 9"" length (I can see the entire line at once). The 1"" width is good too. It is 7/16"" high.I doubt I'll be using this. Gonna try a lighted magnifier with no yellow, like Carson's MagniBar LED magnifier."
3,the editor was fogbound too,"a decent read, a decent story idea, and a good set of unbelievable characters. but it's frustrating that the protagonist lives on the Jersey shore on the jacket, in North Carolina for part of the story, and in South Carolina for the rest of the story - all in the same lighthouse. come on, this is irritating!"
2,The Amazing Johnathan's Every Trick in the Book,"Altho The Amazing Jonathan is in my top 3 all-time favorite comedians... the tricks and gags in this particular book were not all that great or fresh to me. Perhaps this is due to the date of the book's issue, or the fact that I already knew many of these.May be of value to someone totally green on this type of humor? There were a couple of keepers in there tho. You may be better off getting his DVD of his stage act!"
4,Get the REAL message,"I can't understand the bad reviews. This book is important, not for the surface plot, but for the REALLY creepy idea that Bear purports - that mankind has become so powerful that we can now kill souls. This power has been ursurped from God (or whatever name you prefer) and we now face the consequences. This idea gave me the whillies. What a horrific thought. I am a reader of scifi, horror, etc., and this is the first time I ever came across this idea. Read it with an open mind and consider the possibilities."
2,maybe this was a contract book?,"Greg is capable of much better (his short story ""Petra"" is a jaw-dropping standout, for example). The central idea is interesting, but the development into a story is contrived, choppy, and flows very unevenly. (I really feel awkward saying this, but the book would have been much better had it been written by Steven King.)"
5,A GREAT AUTHOR!!!,"I have not read this book yet as I am now ordering it. However to answer the previous person's post... Greg Bear is an AWESOME writer!! Give his other work's a try!!! You will NOT be disappointed!! I have read MANY of his works and they are EXQUISITE! Try ""EON"" to start with!! Take Care."
1,Gag Me,"I'm afraid that this particular book was terrible. It had a nice start, but that was about it. About halfway through the book you'll find yourself wondering why on earth anyone would publish it. Science Fiction? Not in my world. It fits under the imaginary genre of ""New Age / Action / Anti-War Junk."" The plot was in shreds, several inconsistant ideas running along side of eachother at mixed paces, the story was confusing... Man, this book was terrible. I wish I could relcaim the time it took to read it! Mr. Bear seems to like filling his book with psychic nonsense, which ultimately ruins it. Cant we just have a good science fiction story? Not as long as Greg Bear is out there... Of course, I have heard good things about him, so perhaps this was just a bad example of his work... I hope, for his sake, that it was."
2,A little buzzy,"I bought this to add a center rear speaker position for my home surround system. It works OK, but a little buzzy at higher volumes. A bit large too."
4,A light for the journey!,I found this book very helpful. It's daily readings are short and cut right to the heart! Rupp's insights are not theoretical but practical - born from experience. Our church will use this book as a series for Lent. It fits the time and the theme perfectly. The only trouble I had was keeping coffee out of the cup I used for the reflections!
4,Spiritual Guidance,"I had borrowed the book and it was so enlightening, I then decided to purchase it."
5,Offers a Daily Practice,"This is an exceptional book for spiritual seekers. Joyce Rupp offers a daily practice with reflection, scripture, questions for journaling. The process is 6 weeks and at the end of each week there is time to review that week. She asks questions that take you deep into your process. The book also can be used in a group setting. It is also very inclusive, open to the human experience."
2,"New, Not New","Book listed as new, was not.Book itself is good and helpful to those who use meditations and self growth."
4,Good value,"This cooler is a good value. It is big enough to hold many bottles, yet small enough to fit under a cabinet.The only downfall is that the temperature adjustment is on the back of the fridge, making it hard to adjust if you have a semi-built in situation."
1,Disappointed and still waiting,Product arrived damaged and we are still waiting for part from Sanyo. While the wine cooler may be great (who knows - we haven't been able to use it) the service and response was terrible from Sanyo and from Amazon. I will never order something like this from Amazon again
1,Cheney family values,Ankerberg makes some interesting points but fails to apply his assertions to the Cheney family. The highly respected Dick and Lynne Cheney raised their daughter with the family values that resulted in her settling down with Heather Poe into a fully lesbian lifestyle. Never before has America seen with such detail how Republican family values are not contrary to an active and unrepentant homosexual lifestyle. Mary is Dick's favorite and most trusted daughter and was his top aide during the campaign. Yet homosexuals are considered by definition negative role models (as in the Boy Scouts). Why were Dick and Lynne Cheney negligent parents and why have they failed to acknowledge the tragic mistakes they made in raising a homosexual daughter? Why has Mary refused to accept ex-gay treatment and why haven't Dick and Lynne encouraged her to leave the lifestyle? Ankerberg fails to answer any of these critical questions...
5,Complete and pleasant to read,"Being an aviation enthusiast and former air traffic controller, but without any piloting experience of any sort, I was fascinated by the difficulties posed by piloting an aircraft at night or inside a cloud this book made me aware. I was familiar with the problems and solutions to navigating without land references, but had no idea that if you don't have the horizon in sight you loose track of your verticality and can end up upside down without noticing it!This and other hurdles presented by darkness and bad weather (including icing) to aviation pioneers and the solutions developed are exhaustedly covered in this book, in an attractive manner and punctuated with personal testimonies from those pioneers that make the book that more pleasant to read.Maybe a little to complete if you're not an aviation buff, but if you are, I think this is an absolutely ""must have"" in your collection."
3,Too unreal and predictable,"David ""Spirit"" Walker knew the trail to Purgatory, Texas, was lined with nothing but trouble. Wounded and in desperate need of help, he had survived the treacherous journey to reach the blue-eyed, blond-haired girl of his memories. He takes his nephew to Hannah, the woman who he has had dreams about since they were in an orphanage together so long ago. Hannah hasn't seen her protector in years and is startled to not only find him on her doorstep but that as the book progresses that she is more than just attracted to him. But, torn between the white man's world and his Indian heritage David thinks their being together won't work. How Hannah shows him this will work, and that she can be counted on during a crisis is the main focus of the romance.I found this book to be a bit slow and I lost interest mid way through as it started to get very predictable and a bit boring."
5,Awesome beginning to a really long series,"A mesmerizing book, filled with lots of complex interweavingbetween the present and the past. Highly recommended!"
3,"A good read, though formulaic","Daggerspell is a book that neither floors you with its originality nor grips you with its well drawn characters. Still, it's not a bad book, and I had no problems reading it all the way through and generally being satisfied. If you like books with intricate plots, great character development or nonstop action, look elsewhere. If you're looking for reasonable development of those things, give Daggerspell a try,"
3,"Enjoyable, but drags in places.","This entire series had a lot of potential. It just didn't live up to it. Katharine Kerr dwells on some mundane stuff and skims over the exciting parts. The flashbacks got kind of annoying after a while, too, especially when they interrupted scenes that I was really enjoying. At times, they didn't seem to have anything to add to the story, either. An interesting story overall, but there's stuff out there that's a lot better."
5,Great Book,I just read this book and it was done and gone within 24 hours. The charactors are so believable and the storyline doesn't drag. If you like fantasy this is a great book. It was nice finding another author after finishing Tara Harper and Mercedes Lackey books. Both of those authors are right up there with Kathrine Kerr on my list.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This Product is awful. Thre are no ""diamonds"" in it, it is just silver metal. The ovals are not set in a straight line, and as soon as I opened it, it broke right at the middle hindge. The stones are not even close to sapphires, they are some kind of glass. Total misrepresentation, I am sending it back."
3,Pearce Grips,The grips need a lot of fitting for the safety and on the right side as the very tight fit made the gun not work. After the poor fit i went back to the hard grips as i no the gun will work with them. If you get these grips test the gun at the range as you do not wount a miss fire at the wrong time.
3,Wrap-Around Grips,good night .. I want to know if you have the grip for taurus 380 model pt938 or pt940.... (Wrap-Around Grips)
3,Bought these grips,"Product is so/so, These Pearce grips feel great, but are a little sloppy covering all of the frame, hard to reach the tip up barrel lever, and the safety will not move unless you oil under the grip. I might have to shave the area over the draw bar. Kinda thick, might restrict movement.overall, good grip, good price."
1,Pearce grips,Will not fit the Taurus PT22. Interferes with the proper operation of the safety. I personally would not purchase this item for your Taurus PT22.
5,Perfect fit,"Perfect fit, These grips are certainly more durable than the original rosewood grips that came with the pistol, as they are paper thin. The Pearce grips would certainly be a perfect replacement for the flimsy plastic grips that some PT 22's come with."
5,"Mellow, lyrical.","This is way, way better than Noah's first CD, ""Sticks and Stones"", and I have nothing but good things to say about it. Noah is still a relatively unknown talent, and I'm sort of surprised. He's terrific live and I hope he eventually comes up north so I can see him again."
5,Another Super CD from Noah Paley!...,I loved the first CD--practically wore it out. The second is even better than the first! I'm ready to hear a third CD. Hope Noah keeps these great tunes coming. Buy this CD and it's money well spent.
1,AS TO THE REVIEWER BELOW WHO SAID 'DIVA',"This is right on the money. But at least the Diva put out good songs in the real country mode with this collection. Best cut on here is ""Somebody Should Leave"". This CD is a winner all around!"
5,A LITTLE MORE COUNTRY AND LESS POP!,"That's what Reba used to be and it suited me just fine. This is a fine sampling of Reba at her finest. THERE ARE many people who like her this way just fine. She disappointed many, many fans when she quit doing music like this. This is a pleasant reminder when she was a little more country and less pop."
5,THIS IS REBA'S FINEST!!,"If you want to hear an example of Reba at her finest you would be hard pressed to find a better greatest hits package than this one. This is ""real country music"" and it doesn't get any better."
5,favorite female singer in all music,"to start when it comes to singers Reba Mcentire tops period whether your a country fan or not once you hear her your hooked she picks the right songs the right lyrics Reba sings a variety of love, heartache and she does a mighty fine job when it comes to singing about heartache as noted in ""Whoever's in New England to a tearful ballard,Little rock Reba's one of few female singers you don't get bored of and when i play that tape or anything by her she sings like nobody has ever done before to add it is a must have even if your not a country fan she is one singer you will like from day one and that's a promise after all a promise made is a promise kept Reba rules in my house."
1,Untrustworthy Biography,"David Starr Jordan (1851-1931) was a distinguished ichthyologist, a successful teacher, a forceful public speaker, and an influential advocate of both environmentalism and world peace. Perhaps because he rose to be president of two different leading research universities (first Indiana, then Stanford) his published observations on a variety of subjects about which he had no competence at all continue to receive respect they do not deserve.The only topic which engaged him that I can speak about with any authority is the life of the naturalist C. S. Rafinesque. In this book, Jordan frequently mentions Latin and Greek scientific names of fishes first described and named by Rafinesque. Jordan should have stopped with that. But rather, he essayed to tell us something about the immigrant naturalist's life as well. I have written elsewhere that nobody made more mistakes about Rafinesque's life in fewer pages than did David Starr Jordan. He still holds that unenviable record."
5,One of Wuorinen's finest works to date (GENESIS),GENESIS is arguably the finest addition to the orchestra-choral repertoire since Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms. Premiered by Blomstedt/San Francisco - this is a live recording deWaart/Minnesota from the co-commssioner. The disc also includes Wuorinen's beautiful MASS (conducted by the composer) and a piano transciption on Josqin's AVE CHRISTE (performed by the composer). An essential disc for anyone interested in the music of our age.
3,oxbow holds up,"Oxbow Incident, for all its stagey exaggeration, is a timeless piece and one of Fonda's best. He's the guy with the conscience, the holdout juror of 12 Angry Men cowboy style. Holds up as a classic example of a rush to judgement, a morality play without being cloying that might do well in schools today.Gentleman's Agreement, on the other hand, is a painfully heavy handed treatment of a serious subject. Well meaning for its day, its overstated earnestness doesn't hold up with time. The stalwart Gregory Peck is plodding and tortured and morose, good treatment for Captain Ahab but not here.Anastasia is ridiculous and slow and cumbersome, no one is likeable, stillborn from the get go. Maybe it played okay upon its release but it has no echoes for today, the story isn't remotely true and one finds a hard time believing or caring."
5,Not bad at all.,"These headphones have pretty good sound for being lightweight. Seems to have a good balance of high-mid-low. Also, as I have tried out several sets of small headphones recently, this unit can tolerate high volume better than any others I've purchased. Larger headphones handle high volume better than small ones, but these do well. Equally important... these cans are comfortable on the ears and head. I've worn them for hours at a time and they are comfortable. The cord isn't very long, maybe about a yard or meter or something, but that's not a problem for me. I originally wanted lightweight headphones with a volume control, but I think I purchased most of the ones available but didn't care for any of them. I'll be buying two more sets of these."
2,sound healer,"I own about a dozen crystal bowl CD's and another half dozen tibetan bowl cd's. This one is by far my least favorite. I have come to the realization that Halpern doesn't do it for me, even though , as a sound healer, I so wanted to like his music. If you want good crystal bowl music, check out Deborah Van Dyke or Elivia. If you want absolutely great bowl and overtone music, check out Klaus Wiese."
5,Crystal Bowl Healing,"I use this CD in my energy work practice with great success. Steven Halpern does a great job with all his CD's, I have many. The crystal bowls illicit conversation as well since it's amazing what can be done musically with bowls. I recommend this item and seller repeatedly."
1,Feedback,"The recording mechanics on this CD were terrible, painful feedback at low volume. There seemed to be no theme to this CD,it was a waste of money."
1,"Ack, my ears!","I own quite a few of Steven Halpern's CDs, and I find his music more comforting than a lot of other sound healing stuff. However... the ""noise"" of crystal bowls is not for me. Apparently some people find it quite tolerable, seeing some of the good reviews this album received. But if you're like me-- the type who experiences slight panic attacks when a fast train blows a horn as it hurls by in a subway, when someone with long nails scratches a chalkboard, when Mom plays the Vienna Boys' Choir at top volume, when a mosquito molests your ear at bedtime-- skip this one. Personally, I can't see how anyone can bear this loud, high-pitched ""UFO-approaching"" noise. And if you turn the volume down enough to tame the crystal bowls, you can't hear any of the other sounds. I suppose sound healing is largely a matter of taste, but just be careful with this one."
1,Don't buy this book- SAVE your money and time!,"I bought this book because this website makes the book look really nice. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. It looks like someone made cheap black and white copies of recipes, stuck a color front page on it, and is selling it for $23.95! It's cheap and shouldn't be sold for more than $5! Honestly, I think I can make a better copy of a cookbook! I can't comment on the recipes itself- I am returning it and getting my money back. I would like to note that I don't know how in the zone the recipes are if the author of the book is severely over weight!"
5,One of my Favorite CDs,"Beautiful piano playing - what an amazing touch he had and what gentle, yet powerful understanding and feeling he projected. A gift and a treasure. The Vienna Phil is spot-on and the interaction between pianist and orchestra is pure joy to hear. Outstanding recording quality, too. I play this at least once a week."
3,So it's corny... SO WHAT!?,"So I know it's got really bad acting and big glasses, but I love this movie. It's one of those films you can put on and laugh at, but still be intrigued with where the writer and director were trying to go with it. Sure, they could remake it and have all the special effects and crap, but the idea is a good one and it's fun."
3,Cheesy Pleasy,"I watched this movie for the first time many many years ago, and liked it then, and I still like it, although it's definitely very cheesy. An underground world called Atlantis (the legendary one) with all the technology of the above ground world, including the same language, is a little hard to swallow. But if you watch it for the sheer fun of it, I think you will enjoy it. It's kind of like Total Recall in a very vague sense; the scenery reminds me of Mars in Total Recall. The makeup and costuming is interesting, and I have a feeling they wanted to do a whole lot more with this movie but either budget cuts or editor cuts made this impossible. So if you want to escape from reality for an hour and a half, I'd say go for it. Kathy Ireland's voice is really annoying in this, but that was on purpose, and they turn it into a running gag. So don't expect a great movie, but if the storyline and characters don't do much for you, hopefully the scenery will. I liked it."
2,I forgot how bad this was,"I watched this as a teenager with friends, and we liked it, even though it was trite and had horrible special effects. I bought it out of nostalgia, and WOW, it is really a BAD movie. Kathy Ireland is still pretty, and there are still passages that are cute and make me smile, but I had to fast forward through parts of it because I couldn't stand to watch it. Plus, she plays up the squeekiness of her voice, and it is sort of painful to sit through.It was recommended in other reviews to buy the Mystery Science Fiction Theater 2000 version, and I REALLY wish I had."
3,Listen to how her voice even changes...,"One of Kathy's first starring role. Follow her throught her change from beach bunny to women, even her voice changes. Lots of sexy Kathy, lots of plot, sort of, and her hero. Pick this one to see how Kathy use to sound and where she got her start from. This is a must for any Kathy fans."
4,One of the Top B-Movies,"If you like B-Movies, like Kathy Ireland or both then you will like this movie. Except for Wanda's (Kathy Ireland) high pitched voice, I thought it was kind of cute. It is a funny, science fiction adventure with a little romance thrown in."
4,Very Stylish,I love this laptop bag. It's very stylish - got loads of compliments. The inside of this bag has many compartments including an area the laptop of course. The drawback is that the handle is a little hard (meaning not so flexible) and could be a little roomier (just a little).
4,Great Lamp,"I had been looking all over the place for an urban/modern lamp for a newly remodeled office and bought this lamp. Unlike some of its competitors, it doesn't feel cheap and it doesn't look cheap out of the box. Additionally, the light is concentrated where you shine it - so don't plan on lighting up the whole room with it. The bulb also gives off a lot of heat, so make sure you don't put it in a cramped or confined area. If you are looking for an urban-style lamp that's going to give you a lot of light where you want it, you can't go wrong for the price."
3,Bland Handel,"This CD is typical of some of the Baroque ""specialist"" recordings that represent Handel's music as something bloodless and otherworldly. It has been recorded with much reverb to mask the smallness of the voices. The voices are also quite young and expressionless. The notes are right, though, and the music itself is worth knowing."
1,100 very ugly hats,"I am very dissapointed in this book. Old patterns, some ridiculous, like those ones made by my grandmother.I could hardly chose one or two patterns to knit / crochet.I am really thinking in giving this book away, it annoys me thinking I pay money for it, not worth any penny."
4,Good book!,"I actually really like this book! At first I was doubtful because this is a knit and crochet book-which usually means really weird crochet designs and really nice knit. Unfortunately I don't knit, but I figured out of 100 hats there has to be SOMETHING I like.There is! I think the cloche hats are beautiful and they don't look incredibly hard to make. Sure, some of the hats are really goofy but to me those kinds of hats are perfect for children dressing up. I didn't buy this book expecting to like every single one of them.If you like hats, know how to knit or crochet, then this book is for you!"
1,100 Ugly Hats,"What an amazing array of ugly hats! The black and white hat on the cover pretty much sums up what you'll find inside this book. 99 hats you couldn't be paid to wear, let alone waste time making.The models smile as though they're suppressing stomach pains - and who's doing their make-up anyway? Did we hire our sister-in-law or something?This book is so strange. Dime store modeling, ugly yarn color combinations, really seriously bad designs - Nobody would wear these hats. Most of the hats are crochet - which of course is not a good place to start - but they didn't get anywhere with any of the designs. Nothing new, nothing great, and lots to simply gawp incredulously at.Fortunately, I like to check pattern/cook books out of the library before buying. With the library having online reserving, it's pretty simple to check out the book prior to ordering.Save your money, unless you need photos of 1970's Ugly Hats made by Grandmothers who shopped thrift store Yarn sections."
2,totally unbalanced,"The sopranos aggressively dominate the sound (-2 stars) and the Spem is awashed in vowels (-1 star). Did you know there are 24 tenor and bass parts vs 8 soprano parts? You certainly can't tell from this recording. This can only be recommended to those with no interest in hearing anything aside from the soprano melody with maybe some backup support from the alto and background noise from the male voices. Also the Spem is recorded with the singers in a straight line ... a less than ideal position.A previous reviewer mentioned the Obrecht Missa Maria Zart recording ... again an amazingly beautiful piece, the sound of the recording is rich and resonant but then the sopranos start singing and ruin the mood."
4,Great Tone!,The black coating will wear off. But i was really impressed at how these sounded on my guitar! They sounded very full for $10 strings. I recommend.
2,A bit disappointed,"While the black strings look really cool on a red Strat, the fact that 1 broke 2 days after putting them on. I am not saying I would not purchase them again, as it well could have been an anomaly. (I have had it happen with other brands). The issue is more the fact that I can't buy just 1 string to replace it (unless I can go to Guitar Center)."
1,Doesn't include all of the songs of the original,"I plan on buying this album on CD (to replace my old vinyl copy), but I noticed this version only has half of all the songs on the original. I'm going to make sure and order the more expensive 2-disk CD. Just a warning if you plan on buying the cheaper CD."
3,Class warfare at the taxpayers expence,"Booby Kennedy's vendetta had more to due with the Teamsters endorsement of Eisenhower than organized crime. It also shored up support from the anti-union, conservative southern Democrats necessary for JFK to get nominated over LBJ.There is much written about RFK fathers activities in organized crime and how the family built their fortune and had the same effort that was expended on framing Hoffa had been directed at the Kennedy family there would have surly have been charges handed down against them.I would suggest reading more information pertaining to the Chattanooga trial of Hoffa and how the jury was rigged and the witness who accused Hoffa of jury tampering was actually on the payroll of RFK.This is a good read for every working class individual as it demonstrates the length the wealthy will go to to ensure that the working class never really have a voice."
5,At last . . . something that works in the real world,"This book is most likely the best book on copywriting you'll ever read. I studied every page and every example advert that Joe so generously gives. Not only was the book entertaining, but I made lots of extra cash as a result of applying Joe's unique methods of advertising.The best thing about this book is Joe's refreshing approach to writng headlines, he uses just two words. These create the curiosity needed to get people to read on.The reason I believe why some people criticize this book is because Joe flies in the face of some of the garbage other copywriters expect you to believe. This is a book you cannot not afford to read. Joe's stuff works, I trebled my business as a result of applying his techniques. If you like mediocrity just believe what the critics say. If you like money - lots of it - then get this book and apply the ideas, they work."
5,Powerful in Helping Written Ads,"This book teaches marketers how to write influential messages on printed ads, such as magazines and newspaper. If you are going to market you products on printed ads, this book is valuable to read. The purpose of ads is to draw people's attention in order to build up their awareness, therefore, ads is very important in marketing."
1,Are we talking about the same book here?,"Frankly I'm surprised at you all. This book is entry level, nothing more (or less), but NOT the ultimate resources etc. Long winded, lightweight and showing its age, it compares poorly with Robert Bly's The Copywriters Handbook. Get that masterwork instead, not this rubbish."
4,Very entertaining,"It is a good product. The songs are the very similar to the originals, but I didn't know that it didn't show the lyrics on the monitor."
4,colorful,"nice collection of colors but instead of the two added glitters, there should've been more primary colors."
5,Purchased,Received a quantity of two in great condition. I have used and LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is a must buy
1,Get Nancy's own book instead :-),"Basically, this book won't tell you anything the media hasn't beaten to death over the past 4 years. It may have been informative when it was first published, but most people- and especially skating fans- will learn nothing new from this book.I'd definitely recommend Nancy's own book over ""Edge of Glory,"" which ends prior to the 1994 Olympics."
5,"Bring back the ""Breeze"" of Don Ho!!","My sister bought the album, ""Tiny Bubbles"" back in 1966 when she was eleven years old. How did she hear of Don Ho? The album was on sale in a record store. So she bought and at home we all listened to it--I was blown away by it, and when his second album came out, ""The Don Ho Show"", I BOUGHT IT--and wore it as a vinyl record. I LOVED THIS ALBUM--especially ""Blue Coral"".I was deeply saddened when Don passed away last April 2007, I thought I should have seen him in public when he was so great in the 70's and 80's.But I never had a chance to--so this album is a great representation ofhis shows back in the late 1960's--when he was in his prime.Hawaii and showbiz will never be the same. ALOHA! DON HO!!!"
2,Didn't last longer than a few months...Nice when it worked,"Didn't Last longer than a few months. This came in my school kit for film and media. The sound was okay when it was working. Nothing amazing, but good enough for what i needed and the price of them (they were selling 40 dollars in my school store). After about 4 months of use, the part near the audio jack started to separate and fray. They were completely unusable after that. I posted pictures so you know what i am talking about."
2,"Nice, but little low end bass","A quality product, but it has too little low end bass. I use them to edit soundtracks on home videos and animations."
4,Good Bouncer,"Good Basic Bouncer (I don't think all the bells and whistles available are necessary), blanket is nice touch, bouncer vibrates, but animals on activity bar are removable. My 3 year-old removes them every day and then they tend to migrate around the house. This happens at my child's daycare center too- the older babies always take the toys off so the bar is usually bare. So if you have an older kid and you want toys for your baby to play with get a bouncer with toys that are not removable (like Fisher Price's flutter and chimes). This bouncer is on the small side so if you have a big baby it might not work (it was fine for my daughter who was 7 lbs 11 oz at birth)"
2,Too small,"I bought this as a surprise for my 4 month old nephew. My sister called today when she received the bouncer, and she said its nice, but too small! My nephew is small he's 4 months old and she said that it would only be good for a newborn. I'm disappointed, the ad said it was good for up to 3 yrs of age... Amazon has let me down, but I'll survive."
2,Up to 3 years? Are you kidding?,"I bought this a couple days ago for my nephew who is 1 and a half year old, and this product is just too small for him. He already weighs 24 lbs, this product's maximum supported weight is 25 lbs. And 24 lbs IS the average weight for kids on that age, mind you."
5,A must for the Cristero Historian...,"The author, Jean A. Meyer, took the great challenge of writing on the immensely controversial subject matter. His dynamic coverage of all aspects concerning, La Cristiada, is truly an ingenius accomplishment. It gives the reader the liberty of reading his journal-like manuscript, with ease and confidence. Knowing that it is a complete work."
4,I Enjoyed the Video,"This video is great if you want to see Adams, TN and where everything happened. The video is at best an A-. It's not a million dollar Hollywood production but the information is A+.I have always wanted to go down to Adams, but living 2000+ miles away it just isn't possible. With this DVD I was able to experience seeing all the locations and where everything happened. I did like the end where they just showed the locations. That gave me a chance to survey the land and get a better feel for where everything took place.I am glad that I got this video. It gave me a chance to visit Adams without having to go across country.Rocky"
3,Not worth the money,"This is okay for anyone who just wants to 'sight see' the movie, and not HEAR what anyone is saying.The sound was horrible throughout,and I could hear nothing until the last few minutes, then it suddenly blasted to full volume, and frightened the crap out of me, after I had turned it up as loud as it would go to try to hear what was being said, during the rest of the video.On the plus side: It is nice to be able to SEE all the important areas around Adams Tennessee where everything happened, especially if like me, you know what you're looking at. (But if you don't, you might as well forget it, since you can't hear the guides or others at all.)I just wish I could hear the whole thing, and not just the last three minutes of it.It really is not worth the money when you can't hear the interviews and descriptions of the places you're visiting on this video."
4,Great Salsa,"Great album by a group with a mature sound.Thumbs up to these kids for incorporating the old style with the new.Reminds me a lot of the old time salsa from Venezuela, Los Satelites, Dimension Latina etc."
4,Very satisfied replacement for Adcom GFA-545,"When my Adcom GFA-545 died, I was shocked to see the prices for the new Adcom amps. I decided to take a chance on the AMP3 and am very satisfied with the sound and apparent quality of the AMP3. I had a simple question for tech support and was able to reach them by phone with no wait. So far, so good. I just hope it last 15 years like my Adcom. I would then give it 5 stars."
4,The Tawny Gold Man - Amii Lorin,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERLong ago, in what seemed another lifetime, Jud Cammeron had vowed to love her always. Now, as Anne Moore looked at her stepbrother, she saw a total stranger -- assured, arrogant, commanding - who had returned to take control of his father's estate and everyone on it. He was so close and yet so far away. What had happened to the Jud she remembered? And what was happening to her, a woman engaged to one man yet bound to a memory -- a moment of wild, rioting sensation when she answered the passionate demand of Jud's hungry kiss?"
5,A great premise for a sci-fi adventure book,Barbara Kesel has a tremendous ability to craft characters in an action-adventure story. Sigil has a truly original and compelling premise and lots of excitement.Anfd the greater mystery will keep you coming back. Mark Waid's sequel to this book is equally fantastic.
1,i'm not sure who's dumber...,"...the person who made this and tried to market it, or me for purchasing it. on second thought, me.ducati should hunt this chump down and cull them like a baby seal.although, like the above reviewer, i too did not make it to the end of the dvd. maybe there were some redeeming features near the end? doubtful.so bad.seriously.thanks for reminding me to think before i buy.corey brown"
4,MUST HAVE REFERENCE!,"Lots of good information throughout. What makes it worth buying are translations in back. Extensive philatelic terms are translated into German, Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, Greek, etc. Super for figuring out what stamp inscriptions mean and for determining key words in foreign catalogs."
3,I think I love it!!,"I have carpal tunnel really bad & using the mouse can really make my fingers go numb, something about this angled down, seems to help me!! I did have to Micky Mouse me a wrist pad for it though, because there's nothing to put your wrist on,except the hard edge, but I love the concept, they just need to add a soft wrist pad to it!!"
2,This mousepad is not adjustable,"I don't know if it's insulting or just sad that they described this mousepad as having ""adjustable angle"" and as ""designed for right and left handed people."" What they're actually saying is that you can rotate it, and that you can put it on either side of your desk.You cannot change the angle of the incline. There are no moving parts. Other than that, a nice round mousepad with a slight tilt."
3,Caves in and slips around a lot,"Not as anti-slip as I would have hoped. Also not solid in the middle so if you push down at all it caves in. Good angle, though."
4,This Works,This product works. My wrist liked it right away.No break in adjustment needed. I did not take the stickybacking off as I did not want it to stick to wood furniture. It has been fine that way. My only wish isthat it was black and not shocking blue it is just too bright.
1,Ho Hum,"I'm fairly new to knitting, and very gung ho about it, but this book doesn't excite even me. There really aren't any patterns that make me want to pull out my needles. The stuff in it went out of fashion years ago, yet Ms. Eaton claims to have her finger on the pulse of ""chic"". She would be wise to henceforth eliminate that word from her vocabulary, and to remove the exclamation point from her keyboard, since her overuse of both is tiresome."
2,Yawn.,"What a bore. Maybe I just don't care for Jil Eaton's ""style"" (lots of boxy shapes and drop shoulders---what decade is this again?) but I didn't like even one of these. The patterns are so simple, you already have similar ones, or can make them up yourself, trust me. Spend your money on something with a little creativity."
5,Sensational Ease,"Jil Eatons latest, ""Simplechic"" has once again hit the top with fun patterns full of palette, yarn and sparkle possibility that WORK!!I love her photos. They show such natural warmth which inspires in me an eagerness to begin and create anew. THANK YOU JIL"
2,Not as good as her other books,"Disappointed by this one. First of all it's a very small book, same as her other books. I'm only glad I bought it at a much lower price than the current one. Maybe it would be good for beginner's, because the designs are very simple."
2,Interesting but...,"I didnt realise it was published in the late 70's, so while its interesting, a lot of the locations are no longer open."
5,DROP!,"This flute kicks serious bass. I have this hooked up to a pair of 18"" Bose woofers and feel like DJ Magic Mike every time I play."
3,"Remastered and Restored, But Ran Out of Steam","Blue Moves is finally remastered and restored to its full length but it is the effort of a tired man after the Eltonmania of the 70's. The album cover and the songs betray a world-weariness. Better than some of his offerings in the 80s and 90s but difficult to listen to and not quite the ""feel good"" album."
2,"Interesting as a career turning point, but little else","After his previous studio album ""Rock of the Westies"" failed to live up to the commercial promise for which he had been known, Elton John took a misguided turn by recording this double album that sought to be a change of artistic direction, but ultimately proved to the world that his days as king of the charts were numbered.The result is this uneven album that might, given a tad of reworking, been a reasonably decent, if different, single album. But spread over four sides (in its original vinyl form) it seemed little more than an uneven effort of an artist becoming all to aware that he has seen the peak of his commercial career.There are some worthwhile songs here for those patient enough to sort through all the filler, but if you don't have any of Elton's previous studio efforts, you are better off starting there. It would take Elton's career years to recover from this dud, and even then it was only a partial one."
5,brilliant masterpiece,This album displays the songwriting brilliance of the duo and especially the production brilliance of Gus Dudgeon. The album runs the gamut from rockers to ballads. It also establishes James Newton Howard as an incredible composer. As Elton ages he should consider an instrumental album with Howard who is now doing just about every other movie score these days.
4,"Okay, It Doesn't Matter","I remember buying this album on its release date and totally enjoying it. Not being a giant fan of EJ, I found the songwriting and emotional content of this recording to be innovative. I believe this was EJ's first recording to be released after he announced his gayness. If that is correct, which I believe to be true, that would account for the album's poor sells (remember the times). Nevertheless, of all of EJ's recordings, this one strikes me as his best. Of course, Yellow Brick Road needs acknowledgement here for it was groundbreaking."
3,Provocative and diverese,"There are some bland selections and the overall mood is laid back. Then there are some really intricate and memorably thought provoking arrangements (Tonight, Someone's final song, If there's a god in heaven)which complement the upbeat foot stomping tracks (Bite Your Lip, One horse town and Crazy Water). A worthwhile addition,if only for the masterpiece ""Tonight"" and the somber single ""Sorry seems to be the hardest word,"" for any Elton John enthusiast."
5,Great album!,"Elton John admitted when recording the LIVE IN AUSTRALIA album in 1986,that this album was one of his personal favorites. From this album come TONIGHT and SORRY SEEMS TO BE THE HARDEST WORD which would appear on LIA also. The songs would be respectively covered by George Michael and Joe Cocker on 1991's TWO ROOMS-CELEBRATING THE SONGS OF ELTON JOHN AND BERNIE TAUPIN. That album was a tribute to the 25-year songwriting partnership between Elton and Bernie. The other songs on this album are cool."
4,Blue in name only. Red Hot in sound,"A little patchy in parts but for the main a superb album. You can see why his old mates Roger Pope and Caleb Quaye were re enlisted in 1975. Popes drumming on Crazy Water & One Horse Town are a stand out. Quayes funky guitaring style is evident throughout the album. Some of the tracks could have been cut and this would have made one hell of a single album.Even listening to the album today with its remastered sound, I find still very enjoyable and a flashback to the 70's when artists made real music not just noise!"
4,Blue Period,"Blue Moves is a sweeping double album from Elton John. Darker in many places than most of Mr. John's prior work, Blue Moves has an orchestral vibe coursing throughout. ""Tonight"" is a stirring song with a tremendous vocal and a haunting melody. ""Cage The Songbird"" is lovely track while ""Someone's Final Song"" has a heartbreaking beauty. ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"" was the lone top ten single from the album and it is a tremendous song. Mr. John provides a tragic vocal backed by a swirling orchestral sound. The song also has the feel and sound of an Italian squeezebox ringing throughout that conjures up visions of heartbreak in a Venetian Cafe. Not all the songs are downers. ""Bite Your Lip (Get Up & Dance)"" is a musical workout, exhorting you to get out of your seat and move. Blue Moves proved to be Mr. John's last big commercial hit until the mid 80's and his last top ten album until The One some 16 years later."
3,Worth getting replacement copy,I bought Blue Moves when it was vinyl. I played the album to a scratchy state. I did not hesitate one bit to replace the album with the CD version.
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this marked a huge change in direction into a more disco sounding album and so it only makes sense that the standout tracks are the ballads ""Tonight,"" ""Chameleon"" and ""Sorry Seems To Be"" cuz the uptempo quasi-disco stuff is not Elton and it's not good. He continued this vein for the next few years and proved he didn't know how to do disco."
2,A passable single album as an overblown double one,"What could have been a nice, introspective single album for Elton John colpases under its own weight as a double one. Some very strking moments (""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word,"" ""Crazy Water"" and ""Tonight"" for example) are undercut by such unneeded (and sometimes embarrasing) filler like ""Boogie Pilgram,"" ""Bite Your Lip"" ""If There's A God In Heaven,"" ""Theme From A Nonesistant TV Series"" etc."
4,A Classic ahead of it's time,"Back in 1976 when it was released ""Blue Moves"" was a gutsy try to NOT sound the same as Elton's previous works. It succeeds. It now stands as a timeless classic. Yes, it can be a little sad in places but that's the way Elton and Bernie were at that point. This album really has a lot of different sounds to it and is very entertaining."
3,Rainy Day Elton,"When this album was released in 1976, EJ was the biggest entertainer in the world, but he was exhausted and frustrated with his celebrity. As a result, Blue Moves is easily his most introspective and sad album. Generally panned because it only included one ""hit"" (albeit one of the most beautiful songs he ever sang), ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,"" Blue Moves nonetheless is a hidden treasure that should not be overlooked by fans of Elton's 70s work. Among the highlights: gorgeous harmonies from Crosby & Nash on several tracks, an early session appearance from ace saxophonist David Sanborn, the lush orchestration of the London Symphony Orchestra, and some tasteful charts that stretch from introspective folk to gospel to R&B. Also, this is the best sounding EJ album, with a soft mix that accentuates everything from Elton's piano (of course) to Davey Johnstone's always beautiful guitar work to Ray Cooper's perfect percussion accents. This is a great rainy day album."
5,Worth every penny!,"Flashback: sitting in my older brothers room, listening to a mixed 8 Track, and hearing ""Between Seventeen and Twenty"". This album seems to be brushed off by many listeners (including my brother!) but I feel this is the most disturbing? Elton John album in the catalog. Every emotion is pure, especially the sense of loss. The only drawback is a couple songs that tend to distract the listener from the overall feel of the album (Bite your lip). A hard album to describe but I have been in love with it since I was about 7 and still am!Best Songs: Tonight, Cage the songbird, Sorry Seems..., Between 17..., The Wide Eyed... Chameleon, Someone's Final Song, Idol, and the cover art is worth the price of admission alone!"
5,Brilliant,I read this book in this entirety and now I read sections before almost every mediation I conduct. Mediators will benefit from this fascinating approach that externalizes the problem. Externalization allows for a fresh way to help people resolve conflict. I highly recommend this book.
1,The Worst Game Ever!!!!!!!!,This game was terrible because it does not have a lot of things to do. Another reason I didn't like this game was because it is not exciting at all.
5,Gorgeous Vocal and Choral Music,"Sanford Sylvan is the perfect artist to interpret ""Being Music"" with his rich baritone voice and his exemplary diction. The opening line from Whitman is ""Now I will do nothing but listen."" That pretty well sums up my reaction as I've played this CD over and over. And ""Specimen Days"" to another Whitman text is a rich and quite wonderful setting. If you enjoy gorgeous vocal and choral music, I doubt you will be disappointed in the writing of Charles Fussell and the moving and lively interpretation of these artists."
2,"Decent Performance, not so interesting music","Fussell's music offers nothing beyond the purely conventional. In specimen days, for instance, recitativo-like text setting and uadventurous harmonies and instrumentation make the musical discourse dull and uninteresting."
3,Too black and white,I decided to keep this book after being very disappointed in it. I did not expect to receive a book of black and white photos only. I wish it had been printed in the product review as I would never had bought it. To post it back to America was not worth the expense to me.Yes it is good for description and many drawings and photos for identifying.
5,All you want to know about Agaves,"Agaves of Continental North AmericaThis is a beautiful book and it must have all the Agaves in North America listed.It was recommended in a class by the Agave instructor at Desert Botanical Garden.If you want in-depth Agave information, you won't be disappointed.I enjoy having this in my Desert Landscape collection as a reference. Expensive but it is a textbook"
1,Very poor quality,I was disappointed with this purchase and returned it the next day. The legs of the plant stand were roughly finished with one leg having a long crack running deep into the wood with a very sharp point at the end - something that couldn't be fixed. The wood finish was blotchy. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this product.
3,Solid wood phone stand,I liked the color and make of this stand but it was difficult to assemble after one of the screws failed to hold so i had to use a piece of card board to ensure the screw is tight. I would recommend this product as its strong and looks good. But be careful while assembling.
2,Plant stand,"I do not recommend this product. It's very cheap. The first one we got was broke because the wood was so cheap. I would say that it can't hold much weight, it's not very sturdy. But it does looks like the picture in person."
1,Just open your window and throw out your money.....,"This was truly one of the worst ""Amps"" that I have ever bought.I would have been very upset if it were not for the simple fact that I bought it with a gift certificate I recived at work, so in reality no money came out of my pocket for this ""P.O.S."".Sound out of my stand-alone Home Theater Sub was just horrible, soft, and lacking in every manner possible. The amp only lasted about 8 months before it ""blew"" the capacitors inside, and I truly had no yearning to get this fixed under warranty to reuse (or resale).The best thing that happened to my Home Theater was that this amp burnt out, and was replaced."
1,Homogenised Legato Soup from the Kitchens of Herbert von Karajan,"The reason why DG re-released this 1963 recording of the Mozart Requiem on the Originals is simple - it has the magic name on the cover: Herbert von Karajan. Intrinsically, it is worthless. It's slow, heavy, and afflicted by an opague recording. Just listen to the end of the Kyrie; there is no granularity whatsoever to the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic: it's a tsunami of soup. The Tuba Mirum actually sounds like an offcut from Gotterdammerung. Stylistically, this travesty of a performance is the old school at its most dreary.Karajan went on to record this piece to much better effect in 1976Mozart: Requiemand 1986Mozart: Requiem / Tomowa-Sintow, M√ºller Molinari, Cole, Burchuladze; von Karajan. He progressively becoming faster over time to the benefit of the music. The latter recording is superb.Unless you're ravenous for some thickly textured soup, don't bother with this. It's almost Herbie's worst recording."
2,business owner,The product was put on a core roll that is too big for the printer and we have to unroll the labels and re roll them on a smaller roll to fit the printer.
5,Great Gift!,I have purchased one of the Precious Moments Growing In Grace figures for my neice since she was born. It is a birthday gift every year. They are precious and she loves it when she can hold them!
5,Nice looking and working enclosure,"I have been using this enclosure for my backup for five years, and it has greatly done its job. Showing up in computer quickly after connecting the power and usb cable. It is also reliable, and my backup files have been good in it. It is also nice to have both usb and firewire, although I have not tried the firewire option."
5,"The return in time, One of the best movie themes ever made !","One of the greatest movie themes ever made, need I say more, if you haven't heard or seen Back To the Future you haven't seen one of the greates movies ever made."
2,Some Good Tracks But Mostly Filler!,Back To The Future is an awesome movie but the soundtrack is only so-so! The only really good tracks in this soundtrack are the two songs from Huey Lewis And The News and The instuemental back To The Future Overture. The rest is just filler! I agree with the reviewer who said they should have put Mr. Sand Man in the soundtrack. It's a good song!
3,Good but a little dissapointing,"As a hugh fan of the ""Back to the future"" movies, I was very excited to receive this soundtrack. Unfortunatly, this soundtrack suffer from a lack of very important songs, that are very much remembered and loved.Songs like ""Mr. Sandman"", that symbols the enter of Marty Mcfly to the 50's. I love this song and he is one of the reasons I bought this CD.Also, other versions of the main theme of the movie, that appears on the movie, are missing from CD. this is most unfortunate..."
3,Reminds me of being a kid,Back to the Future has a very fast paced and exciting soundtrack with parts that are very haunting as well. Really enjoy the instrumentals as well as the songs by Huey Lewis and the classics like Earth Angel and Johnny B Goode.
3,Where is the famous guitar solo?,"I was mainly buying this CD because of Marty's famous guitar solo in the song Johnny B. Goode. Unfortunately, there is shorter version of that song on the CD not with the guitar solo. Other songs are OK."
2,"Bad covers, but a few nice tracks","I bought this for the Huey Lewis track and the theme track, both of which are good, but not worth an entire CD."
5,Greatest soundtrack in a long time!,"I listened to this cd. i love it to death!I loved the movie and all the songs make it better. all the songs on this soundtrack i love, especially the Marty Mcfly and Starlighters skit of Johnny B Goode. They really cleaned up this oldie I already loved,and I love the Earth Angel song. Buy this cd. you will love it forever!"
3,Not bad,"There's some good tunes on here. There's nothing I would describe as bad per se. Actually I only bought the soundtrack for one song, ""Time Bomb Town"" by Lindsey Buckingham. As far as I know it cant be got anywhere else. There's a very nervous, almost paranoid quality to this song, not just in the lyrics, but in Buckinghams odd vocal touches and the arrangment. Great stuff IMO, others may disagree..."
1,Well Received,This gift was well received by the family member the was unable to locate a copy was the music shop they were working with.
3,Pretty Good,"Several types of swing dancing, including east coast and west coast. Pretty basic, just a guy and a lady in a plain room demonstating the steps and going over them from all different angles, nothing fancy. The 3 tapes are beginner, intermediate and advanced with different types of swing on each tape. This tape was good but nothing to get excited about."
4,Swing Dancing,Pretty good. It shows the basic moves very well which is good. If you mastered what is shown on the three tapes. You'd really know how to swing baby!
4,nice covers of great orginals,"The Wurzels went into the Sil Willcox's Charlton Farm Studio in East Somerset and re-recorded a dozen of their favourite old Adge Cutler and The Wurzels songs. The songs are linked by Tommy Banner and Pete Budd's between-song banter so that the whole album becomes a journey around the West Country from North Somerset down to Cornwall and back again. The songs are produced quite differently to the originals, so this makes good listening especially alongside the orginal recordings.I agree with Gavin Moore's review that it would be nicer if EMI could re-issue all Adge Cutler's original albums rather than justCutler of the West- and then people could hear all of the orginals as they were originally recorded."
3,Silly packaging,"I get a real kick out of seeing Western releases of Russian music in which the so-called artist responsible for the packaging makes a complete fool of him/her self! Here we have, with English and Russian mixed: ""Lddy Mdcbbth"" I know it's a leap of faith to assume some Western readers guess correctly at the use of a Russian ""B"" (buki) for a Western ""b"" the other letter is small and difficult to see, it could be Cyrillic ""yat'"" in place of an ""e."" The question becomes which letters are really Western and which are really Cyrillic. Is the ""C"" a Western ""C"" or a Cyrillic ""s""? Is the Western ""Y"" really a Cyrillic ""ch""?"
2,terrible...! 1,"I was very disappointed when I purchased this cartoon. I haveread the book, and loved the movie with Richard Kiley, but thiscartoon is worthless. You barely get a taste of the plot or meaning from the book. I only gave it 2 stars because it keep my three children still for a few minutes. END"
5,Wow! I can't believe how much I love this product,"I purchased this product because I am a temp and I go from office to office to work. I have Fibromyalgia, so I need to be able to control my workspace setup as much as possible to relieve arthitis pain. Once I figured out how to set this up, I can work with no pain. I no longer experience pain in my fingers, arms, shoulders and neck. I adjust the height of the rod, set the height and angle of the keyboard tray and I am ready to work. I don't know how I lived without it."
3,"Where is.... ""WANDA""?????","I have Season 1 and did not know at the time that the character of ""Wanda"" did not appear until 2 seasons later.Now I see on the reviews, that ""Wanda"" is not in Season 3 either. She was one of the funniest characters, hands down. Part of why I even watched the show.Can someone with some DVD release expertise explain whey they are leaving this characater out?Thank you very much."
4,Marketing idiot or genius? All depends...,"on what side of the table you sit. I bought this collection and I agree it has holes in it and at times it even throws off the pulse BUT this is still wickedly funny. And do we really have a choice? I work in media arts (not for Fox) and the fact that they included the Season 1 music videos tells me that if they could have continued, they would have. You guys don't know how difficult it is to license this stuff. Airing on TV is one thing while worldwide sales / royalties is another. And it's not just the artists and their labels, I'm sure FOX would need to pay the conceptual artists, videographers, etc. Now if FOX were to turn around and throw all of the music vids on Season 5 OR its own release, then I will be angry. But for now, I'm LMAO."
2,"So, so disappointed!","Those looking to buy this Season 3 boxed set primarily for the music parodies will be sorely disappointed. Episode 29, the Downtown Julie Brown's Music Video Special which featured Jim Carrey as Michael Bolton and Vanilla Ice, Tommy Davidson as Michael Jackson as well as Jamie Foxx as Prince is conspicuously missing. Ironically, the cover art has a picture of Foxx in his Prince garb which leaves a lot to be desired. What a disappointment."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"OK, I bought it hoping to see Michael Jackson busting his hand on a car, I think it was after the song Black or White, my favorite skit ever, not on the disk at all. Seriously why would we want an edited DVD Box Set, or are they going to try to make us by a special In Living Color Music DVD? I think people should boycott buying this DVD set until fox gets things right, I wish I had not bought mine"
2,Severly Edited,I just purchased this item and went directly to the episode with Michael Jackson and this episode is only 15:00 minutes in length total! I will watch more but that kind of has my spirits down. That is probably why the price is lower than Season 3 because none of the original music (except guest performers at the end) or the music skits are in. Buy at your own risk!!
2,missing parts&Not as strong as season 1&2,"the show is missing some things&also the season started to show how much Politics at fox had watered down the show. the start of the end of end was soon kinda felt with the way the scripts were being written&whatnot.the show was more interesting&on point during season 1&2.there were better takes in season 3&onward,but the better stuff was at the start.by season 3 you could see the show heading into a semi predictable state."
3,"Skits UP, Music down","YOU KNOW I DO AGREE THAT IT WAS WRONG FOR THEM TO EDIT OUT THE MUSIC SKITS AND DANCE BUMPERS ON SEASON 2 AND 3, BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THESE MUSIC SKITS WERE NOT WHAT MADE US TOON IN TO THE SHOW IT WAS CHARACTERS LIKE WANDA,FIRE MARSHALL BILL, ANTON, THE MEN ON SKETCHES AND HOMEY THE CLOWN THAT MADE US KEEP TUNING IN EACH WEEK BUT AS LONG AS THE SKETCHES ARE INTACT DON'T WORRY BECAUSE YOU HAVE OVER 28 EPISODES OF GOOD SKETCHES AND THE MUSIC DOESN'T OUTWEIGH THE FUNNY. WE AS FANS AND BUYERS OF THE SHOW DO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A COMPLETE SET LOADED WITH THE COMPLETE EVERYTHING INCLUDING EXTRAS,DELETED SKETCHES AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE SHOWS CREATOR IF SHOWS LIKE SEINFELD,SIMPSONS AND FRIENDS GET GOOD TREATMENT IN LIVING COLOR SEASON 3 DESERVES BETTER THAN ALL"
1,This is not music.,"The plinks and plunks burned onto the CD in question are amusical (atonal) noises the likes of which I have heard from 2 year old children ""playing"" upon a piano. Let me qualify hat statement: I hear more music in the ""playing"" of the average 2 year old than I do in these ""composed"" pieces. Pieces of what? I think you can guess."
4,Very Helpful!,"This DVD is exactly what I expected and is helping me to grasp not only the fundamental of using the the GL-2 but also many of the other features which I didn't fully understand. For me, this is a great purchase and one which I believe will improve my video projects."
1,Poor fit/not true to size,"I like a roomy hoody, and the graphics and dark maroon on this sweatshirt looked great. So, normally wearing a 2XL, I ordered a 3XL. I put it on and found that it was too short...way too short. The shoulder seams are very narrow for a 3xl, and the sleeves and neck are tight. I would have returned it but I didn't keep the receipt. Now I'm looking for someone to give to."
1,Did not work..read below why,"Had this cable plugged into my oem antennae after installing an aftermarket radio and I was getting very little FM station and no AM stations. If you ask why AM? because I listen to sports radio 610 and 950 to catch up on scores and highlights. So I thought I had problems with the radio and I returned it. After my new radio installation, same problem. The stereo tech guy pulled the antennae cable and discovered the pin inside the adapter was too short. He installed a new adapter and Whalaaa...I got all the fm and am stations.Perhaps there is a bad batch of cables out there, so if you run into this problem, you may want to check this cable first."
2,Took some effort to make it work,"Another reviewer stated that they were unable to get any AM and very few FM stations after installing the adapter. When installed on a 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 the same anomaly was experienced. So I took it apart and tried to figure out what the problem was.Problem: The internal wire that connects to the OEM cable is too short.Solution: I ground down metal band that inserts into the OEM antenna cable by about .050-inches. That seemed to be enough to get the internal wire to make a good connection to the OEM antenna cable.It works fine now, but the fact that the internal wire for the adapter was too short is pretty lousy. It might work right out of the package for you, but if not at least there is a solution that should get you back in business."
3,works ok,"Once I found out how to open the thing from other reviews on this site, it works okay.The instructions that come with it are good enough to use for toilet paper if you ran out and don't have time to go to the store.The IDE cable to the hard drive could be shortened a bit. If you don't screw the hard drive in, the IDE cable falls into the fan and makes funky noises. If you screw the hard drive in, the IDE cable gets bunched up. I found if you let the plugged in IDE cable go up and then away from the HDD, it makes it run ok without the loud fan noises that other people complained about. (The IDE cable then goes up back, hangs over the controller/circuit board, then comes back again overlapping itself and down and plugs into the HDD.)The corner pieces that hold the thing together are cheap. I broke two of them while trying to figure out the best way to get the HDD in so the fan didn't make a horrendous noise."
1,Cheap useless junk,"Don't buy this product, really.The 2-page xerox copy of some old printout that you get for ""manual"" is worthless. The product is worthless. Using 2 separate Windows XP machines with this product, in a matter of several days I've experienced the following:a) OS crashes.b) multiple screen freezesc) multiple Windows Explorer freezes or crashes.d) parts of files written to this drive which made drive unusable untill I ran CHKDSK utilitye) on one computer this drive assumes responsibility of automatic Windows backup every time I turn it on, and basically locks 90% of all resources of the machine until it is done. No software or tool to disable this behavior. On the other machine it is fine.This is worthless, untested product, 0 stars. Save yourself hours that I wasted, and spend extra $10 on something better."
1,Thanks For your review,I am thank full for your review as I was about to order this iteam but after reading your review I am not.
5,Grown and developed over the years,"I may be a little biased. I have known the Mccoy brothers for quite some time and have been pleasantly surprised by the way their music has grown and expanded over the years. I had their first cd and if you play the two, you'd never know they were the same band. Of course, several of the members have changed. To top it off with, they are also quite easy on the eyes (just take a look at Shaun). These guys are extremely talented on the guitar, and great writers. I have great anticipation for the next album...MASON COUNTY RULEZ!!!!!!!!"
5,Totally F*ckin Rock's,"I first heard of this band when I went to see another kick @ss band (S.O.R.E.) play at the Rave and since a friend of mine is S.O.R.E.'s manager I was hanging out with these guys backstage. It was my first time meeting both Bobaflex and S.O.R.E. and let me tell you they were totally cool. I sure as hell didn't expect the guy's I was just drinking beer with to go out and totally rock but they totally blew away the crowd ( my self included ). I own this cd and love it, definately buy it. And while your at it check out www.sore-s5.com to check out another kick @ss band."
4,Wow these guys have change since the days at Marshall.,"Man I remember these idiots walking around Marshall University campus handing out flyers to their shows. One of their members would be wearing a Boba Fet mask. Back then they were a crappy nu-metal korn worshiping puke band that most people on campus hated unless you were a drunk fraternity brother laying face down in your own puke. Well this band has sure changed. I guess they must have kicked out some members and discovered circus crazed bands like Finntroll, Dodheimsgard, and Arcturus. This album is way avant gard. They sound exactly like Arcturus. I couldn't believe it. I will now be trying to get this album from a band I neglected at college and once was not proud of comming from West Virginia."
4,Great suburban stroller,"I purchased the 2004 model used and like it very much. It is perfect for my walks around the neighborhood which do include some dirt paths as well as streets and sidewalks. My daughter very much likes the way the seat is up higher than other strollers. It's very easy to push and the step down break is easy to use. The 2004 model is pretty heavy but I have been told they revamped it to a lighter frame in 2006. The height adjustable handle is great for me 5'5'' and my husband who is 6'4''.The accessories are great, sun shade, insect screen, foot warmer etc...The cons are that you have to order the cup holder console sperately from the manufacturer for $29, going off curbs the stroller can roll to the side which makes me very nervous but I think that is true of all three wheel strollers. I also find it's still pretty big when folded."
2,Meh.,"The quality of this ""poster"" was not that great. It's more like a high-ish quality printout than it is a poster. The paper is nice and thick, but the print quality isn't great. Had I known this was a (poor) reproduction, I wouldn't have ordered it. I could print this out at work for free."
1,"Great price, poor acoustics","I purchased this mic to for video taping interviews. I was attempting to improve the quality of the audio of the recording as compared to that obtained using the camera's microphone. After testing with it for approximately one hour I determined that the audio quality was extemely inferior to other available microphones. While it reduced the echo I found using the camera mic, the sound characteristics are very similar the kind you'd find listening through a cardboard tube. If you need to get a decent recording look at the Shure SM58. While you'll spend quite a bit more money, it's well worth it."
1,weak!,"Very disappointed with this mic after reading so many positive reviews. Clipped to a shirt, even high up, it is not strong enough to get a clear recording. You have to hold this mic up close to your mouth like a tiny handheld mic to get good clean sound."
2,Don't bother ordering this - you won't get it.,"I didn't get the 35S. I ordered it, but they sent me the 3350 instead which is somewhat disappointing in it's sound quality - hiss, and it sounds like a little, digital mic several feet away. It's cheap, but at least ship me what I ordered or tell me that you don't have it. ASK if I'd like a substitution next time!"
2,only used a few times,I've only used this mic a few times even though i bought it a year ago. It's never given me clean or sharp audio and it always has scratchy audio from the plug not connecting properly.
5,great sound quality,this mic creates very clear sound from your subjects. I would recommend this mic to anyone. It could pick up noises behind the actor as well clearly so that tells me the mic is awesome! you can even use this as a boom mic if needed. Just try and stand reasonably close to get the best quality.
5,Good sound quality at great price,I've used this mic for maybe a year. The battery seems to last long as I've not replaced it yet. It gets pretty good sound quality. I think it will be better once I figure out more settings on my camera :-) The cord is pretty long. The only thing I don't like is that it is a mono plug. Not a big deal as I've got a mono-to -stereo adapter.
3,Decent for its price.,"There is a considerable amount of static with this mic and it must be positioned very close to the wearer's face. Fortunately the static is very consistent so it is easily removed with a noise reduction filter (the filters in both Soundbooth and Soundtrack Pro worked well) to produce usable audio. It's inconvenient but that's the price you pay for paying so little!I think the ""new"" price is too high. I recommend getting it used or (preferably) refurbished."
3,Bad static when wiggled,"I purchased this because it seemed like everyone said this microphone had great sound quality, and it did. Until I moved around the belt clip On/Off switch, then suddenly there was static in the microphone. I'm assuming it's because of how the cord is built, very thin and cheap. I would not recommend this if your going to use it for video recording. I'd spend a little more money and get a quality product."
4,"Works well, but I have to stay still","I've owned quite a few handheld mics in my time. Lately i have been wanting to have more freedom of movement for my hands.This is the first lavalier mic that I have had a chance to own. While the mic allowed my hands to move as free as I choose, when I moved or walked around from place to place I got a bit of static.Its still a great mic at its price, but I just wish that it would allow for a bit more range of motion. Hopefully soon I will be able to pay for a wireless system from Audio Technica which would eliminate this problem. They make a wonderful product.Overall this is a great mic for the price and I recommend it if you are using it for applications where you arent moving around too much."
5,This is a great inexpensive lavalier microphone!,"For less than 30 bucks, and with a battery (LR44) that is widely available and pretty cheap, this is a great deal, seriously. It's an omnidirectional condenser mic with a 20-ft cord and a wind guard. I've bought 4 of them (one is still in the box, in case AT ever stops making them), and use them for interviews with a Sony consumer-grade DV cam. The sound is great, too. I highly recommend it."
5,It Works Great,This lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out. Well worth while if you're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder.
1,Waste of money,Bought it to plug into my Zoom H2 and it barely picks up anything. Tried plugging it straight into my camera and yet again barely picks up anything. Low quality and waste of money.
2,Fair mic,"This microphone will pick up voices fine. But they sound like they are at the end of a barrel not close up and rich. It is better than using the camcorder mic in a noisy ambient environment, but don't expect top quality audio from this product. You get what you pay for."
4,Good value,"This mic performs well for the price tag. My only issue is sometimes the foam on the mic head falls off easily. Other than that, this is a great little mic!"
1,Disappointment,"I bought this to improve the sound for recordings on a Kodak Zi8. First, the battery was dead when it was shipped - hassle. Once I replaced it with a new battery and tested it, the sound from about 4 feet was better *without* the microphone. So for my use, this microphone was a wasted purchase."
2,Meh....,"The cord was TOO long, it eventually got quiet and stopped working properly for recording lectures. Thought the problem might have been with a part bent in the long cord, so I fixed that up- didnt work, still incredibly quiet. All audio settings on my computer are all the way up."
1,This mic isn't worth a dollar,"I tried this mic and it was terrible. The volume was very low, when you try to increase the volume you get a lot of white noise. Save your money, don't buy this product. I wish i could give it half of a star."
1,Same lemon?,"I do wonder if I just got the same item that has been rated low and returned by others. I plugged it into the microphone jack and nothing happened. I asked a friend who had worked with the same product before, and he thought it should have been plug and play. I returned it and got a Griffin mic instead."
4,Very pleasantly surprised!,"I bought one not expecting much, but was blown away by the power and sound quality the 35S delivered! Great as a backup mic if your pro lavaliere is down. Highly Recommended."
3,ATR-35S IS OK!,"This mic really did surprise me for a low end mic like this. It gets decent quality. Comapared to built-in onboard mics, this mic can really make a world of difference in clarity. The only problem is that the super long cord can get in the way of setting up and packing up. Otherwise, for the price and when in a pinch (like I was for a shoot) this is a good way to go."
2,Sounds like the $22 mic it is,"I do a fair amount of streaming video for marketing and training purposes. I bought two of these lav mics, hoping that it would simplify my usual practice of setting up a mic stand, plugging into the USB interface and keeping the mic out of the frame. I bought two of them because there are times when I'll have two people in the frame, as with an interview.I was very disappoined in the sound quality--but it is, after all, a $22 mic. It's better than using the mic on a webcam because it will reject more of the ambient noise, but it definitely doesn't meet my standards.I am now using an Audio Technica 2020 USB mic, which is just about perfect for my purposes. I can't understand why it sounds better than the cheap lavaliere...it's just 8 times more expensive!Joe Parsons"
5,Great Mic Great Price,"This is everything I can think to want in a lav mic sans wireless. I use XLR at school, and I'd say this compares very well. The sound quality is very clear, and it eliminates background noise like it should.The line is very, very long meaning your interview subject can sit a good distance away from the camera. I dubbed an entire voice over narration using just this and a DV camcorder, and you'd never know it wasn't recorded in studio.Overall this is a great buy."
5,Pro sound in a tiny package,"I bought this actually to use with my cello in a live setting. I needed something that would capture the body sound of the instrument, rather than a transducer pickup. It sounds amazing.I also make videos, and this has been a wonderful investment for interviews. Clip it on and upgrade your audio quality x2.For this price?! Amazing."
1,I can't hear anything,"Either I got a lemon, or I am the most soft-spoken person on the planet. When I record in GarageBand, even turning the volume up to Max on all settings doesn't help enough. Recording in iMovie HD is nearly inaudible. Recording in iMovie '08 can be made to work if you Normalize the Clip Volume after the fact, but even so, the audio only shows up on the left channel.I guess I'll have to save my money and buy something six times as expensive if I want something that works."
2,Wasn't able to use it with an amplifier successfully.,"When I attached this to my collar, plugged it into an amplifier, and turned up the amp enough to make my singing louder, the result was hum and feedback. When I lowered the volume on the amplifier, then nothing was being accomplished."
5,Good value for money,I bought the Audio Technica mics to use while filming video biographies and so sound plays a very important part in what I do - and these mics work great. I would definitely recommend them i.e. if anyone needs more convincing after they see the price tag.
4,Audio-Technica ATR-35S Lavalier Microphone - Great mic at a great price,"I only used this Audio-Technica ATR-35S Lavalier Microphone once since I purchased it on a video shoot. I work in the pro audio realm and I own some expensive microphones - this mic works great - I would consider it an entry level professional lavalier - it will get the job done for interviews, broadcast, etc. The gain is good, tone is good, and the noise is low. It appears to be well made and I expect to use it in my video production for years to come."
4,Good Mic,I haven't been able to use the mics for a long period so I don't know how long the batteries will last but they seem to work really nice. Just wish they could of been able to run on phantom power too.
2,works well,"As the old Volkswagen ad used to say 'it goes forward, it goes backward, it turns in circles. What else do you want?'It does what it claims to do, and it does it well. 'nuff said?Well, Bunkies, time, besides healing all wounds, has a way of showing you what a product is really like. This thing now has a buzz that totally obscures the voices. This developed after only a month. Can't change the stars, unfortunately, hope you read this."
4,Not a bad little microphone,"I've now used this mic several times. It picks up sound very well and makes vocals sound far better than they really should. When used at close range it picks up ""pops"" in ""p"" letters, though, and it could use an LED to indicate when it's on."
2,May not get the job done.,Even for the price this mic may not be worth it. I tried it out on a short video and connected it to a Sony A1U. The mic could barely pick up anything. Nothing could be done to enhance it during shooting except for practically yelling (this is from a collar distance). In editing you can boost the audio levels but the voice pickup is so low that it contends with any other noise it picks up (from batteries or lights or any electronics).
4,Great and usefull,I have use it sometimes now and I like the neat sound in the recordings. Useful in spaces with a lot of external noise and easy to handle.
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!,"We ordered this microphone for the pastor in our wedding. We were sent the wrong microphone and had to pay out of pocket to return it since they did not supply a return shipping label. The package was returned to them about 3 weeks ago and they lost it. We were told "" we are really busy and it might be hard to find your package."" Over a month later and the only thing we have received is terrible service, no product or refund!I rated a 1 star because 0 stars is not an option.I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY"
1,BEWARE!!,"I ordered the ATR35S, but the Amazon vendor Beach Camera sent me the ATR3350. My invoice clearly says ATR35S - I guess they either think we are stupid or it does not matter what they send us. Read the reviews - I am not the only person this has happened to!!"
2,Allsop Scratch Repair System,"I have used this repair kit to fix scratched DVDs and game CDsfor my sons PS2. These discs could not be repaired by this system.In fairness, the PS2 started to deteriate and will not now playDVDs. So perhaps the fault is in the PS2.As a test, I took 10 software installation discs that were obsolete. I used a knife to scratch the surfaces. I was amazed at how much damage these discs suffered before they could not be read by the CD ROM drive. Of the 10, only 1 could be repaired with this product."
2,CD has missing track,"John Barry's compositions are pleasantly sweeping. There's nothing wrong with this album, just not really enough to recommend it.I was puzzled to learn that some time between my buying the LP record and the issuing of this CD, the track ""The Music of Goodbye (love theme from Out of Africa)"" was omitted. It's not that this song, sung by Melissa Manchester, is a must-have; it's more that it's sneaky to leave off tracks when you reissue a soundtrack in another format."
3,Not Bad,"The music seemed to be much more powerful in the movie, when it was paired with the beautiful images of Africa. Without the images, it loses its punch. Now it's just good background music for when you want something quiet and not intrusive."
4,Easy listening music,"I remembered enjoying this soundtrack when the movie first came out and was not disappointed hearing it again, some 20 yrs. later. Track 7...'Flight over Africa' is my favorite, and still makes me a little emotional. Great for cross country car trips or just quiet evenings at home."
4,Can't Miss,This Cd can't miss putting you in a relaxed mood.I listen to it all the time after a stressful day.
5,This music makes you wish you could fly.EXCELLENT!!,"First, John Barry is an excellent composer. This is not the only soundtrack he has done but I do think it is the best. It captures every moment and actully takes you back to a time when things were so very easy and slow. Every moment of this CD recreates in your memory the entire film which was a great love story. the CD itself is a love story and can put you in the loving mood with the first note. It has a Mozart original, concerto for clarinet and orchestra in A, it's wonderful. But the best are the compostions by John Barry. He has an excellent ear for romance and portrays it with every note played. It makes you want to pick up your own instrument and play. It's that amazing. You should certainly buy this one if this is your liking. thanks for listening."
3,too short,The music is fine but the tracks are way too short. 12 tracks in 33 minutes -a whirlwind from Africa.I would have liked to know the length of this CD before purchasing and I would have paid more for a longer version.
2,What happenedr?,"I love watching the film and about every 6 months I watch it again. I enjoy it not only for the wonderful work of art it is but for the majestic score. But the soundtrack album doesn't give the majesty of the full experience of the visuals along with the sound. The soundtrack, divorced from the movie, is a bit boring, though beautiful."
2,Dirt magnet,"Looks great and very comfortable.... BUT!Too bad it is a dirt-magnet and it looks trashy even with a little dirt on it, so I don't wear that much. After 3-4 times I have to clean it with soap and a brush (I'm not a clean-freak!). Soaks in the water and takes 1/2 day to dry."
3,Fabulous Fit - Awful smell,"This flip flop is an all time favorite of mine - I have three other pair of this very same brand and style. However, the black pair that I purchased online is outgassing some awful smell to the point that I can't where them without getting a headache. Its like walking around with the magnified odor of a tire store. I tried leaving the flip flops outside, using Fabreze, and a variety of other odor removers and nothing is helping - needless to say, I am very disappointed and probably won't purchase these online again. The other pair that I have I purchased at a regular shoe store and will probably go that route again - just to be sure to avoid this outgassing problem. Thanks"
1,Not Abundantly Pleased,"I'd read so much about this conditioner being an 'amazing' product for fine hair. Everyone is different but I found it very basic, and it provided no body or fullness whatsoever. It's now on my husbands side of the shower."
5,Broadway goes Country,Great show with good songs and wonderful comic touches. How about a hand for the hog folks! A must listen.
5,BEST MUSIC!!,"I was in this play during the summer of 1998. I had a blast. I LOVE the music so much, I had to buy the CD. I listen to it almost every week. It just stays in my CD player."
4,Best Musical - 1985,"Winner of the 1985 Tony for Best Musical, Roger Miller, best known for his sixties classic ""King Of The Road"", provides a fine score for this adaptation of Twain's ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"". The cast, led by Daniel Jenkins, Ron Richardson, John Goodman, Rene Auberjonois & Patti Cohenour, are terrific & have great voices to match.While the score is not without its flaws, there are several excellent songs:Waitin' For The Light To ShineGuv'mentMuddy WaterRiver In The Rain (my personal favorite)Worlds ApartYou Oughta Be Here With MeLeavin's Not The Only Way To Go"
5,One of the Greats,"This is simply one of the greatest musicals of our time by one of the best song writers,""The King of the Road,"" Roger Miller. So many wonderful songs will just leave you with a goofy smile on your face. ENJOY IT!!!"
5,One of my favorite musicals,"This is absolutely one of my very favorite musicals. Roger Miller's music fits the novel, Huckleberry Finn, perfectly. I used the music in a high school English class after teaching the novel, and the students loved it. There's a little something for everyone here."
2,Very Disappointing!,"When I bought this CD, I was expecting an ""up-and-away"", very lively musical. Instead, I found the singing to be mediocre, most of the songs to be horrible (especially ""Hand for the Hog""), but some to be rather good (like ""Do Ya Wanna Go to Heaven). I would not reccomend buying this album."
3,Is this Really the Symphony for Metal Orchestra?,"Long ago, the Ithaca High School Concert Band issued a vinyl LP purporting to be a recording of Alan Hovhaness's Symphony #17 for Metal Instruments. Anyone who buys this CD expecting to get the same music will be disappointed. The music on this disc, although decent, is clearly not the same work. In fact the numbering of Hovhaness's symphonies appears to have changed. The Mysterious Mountain, which is now #2, was once #4. The original work which I knew as #17, ""Symphony for Metal Orchestra"", now appears to be #20, ""Three Journeys to a Holy Mountain"". I wish they would clear up the confusion."
2,"I bought it so you don't have to, very disappointing!",Awesome incredible performance by the Godfather whom I had the honor and pleasure witnessing live twice in 2006. There never will be another! Why did I rate this particular set so low? The dvd is awesome the companion cd of the show was butchered! There are only 10 songs on the cd and some of them were ridiculously shortened! The entire concert could have been on the cd also. The dvd is about 71 minutes long and the cd was about 37.No excuse for this. Whoever was in charge of producing the cd messed up royally! Save your money and by the single dvd concert it will save you the aggravation and waste of money of the 2 disc set.
3,Connects the laptop to a projector,Not much to say here except that it allows me to connect my laptop to a projector. I wish it wasn't this expensive...
4,Works Perfect. Just What I needed to connect my Macbook Pro to a TV,The item works great. I tried other adapters to connect my older generation Macbook Pro to my TV with a VGA cable. However none of the cheaper adapters worked. Should have just bought the Apple one in the first place.
4,Apple VGA Dispaly Adapter,"I have two monitors and needed a second connector-converter. Same quality, same brand. It's OK...The best way of keep thing together.Thanks"
1,A selection of dishes and the chefs reminder,I am very unhappy with the fact I didnt recieve both of the copies of the book i bought> I paid for 2 copies of this book and only recieved 1 . I have left two emails now to amazon and have not recieved my second book. I am never using this site again .
1,Warning - Deceptive Advertising,This may be a fine 2 channel preamp but I believe calling it a 5.1 (Apparently it weighs 5.1 pounds)is deceptive! Buyer Beware! This will not function as a home theater preamp.
1,Garbage,"I am a PhD student in ancient history. Hartog offered commentary that was unworthy of a sophomore term paper, wrote in a deliberately confusing style, and barely engaged the relevant scholarship on Herodotus that existed back in the eighties when the Mirror of Herodotus was written. No one should ever read this book ever again."
2,Mirror of Herodotus,"I read this book because I was interested in Herodotus' representation of the Scythians. The book had its interesting points, but it was a little intellectual, in the negative sense of that word. I often had the feeling that the writer was saying something important, but I missed his point. Over my head? Maybe. The representation of the other, of course, is the point, and the subject matter - Herodotus - is very appropriate too. But I actually feel Herodotus himself is a better commentator and feel that all Hartog accomplished was to make it sound pompous and obscure. Oh well, I guess I'd never cut it as a French intellectual!All the same, I would have ordered the book but for the hefty price tag, primarily because I am interested enough in the subject matter to give it a second, more careful read."
5,Perfect Pitcher,This is the perfect size for those occasions when I want to make a mocha for both myself and a friend! It's in perfect condition and will probably come in handy for other things as well.
1,What a boatload of garbage!,"Let's get this straight. A bunch of whiny, self-centered, self-serving, arrogant pompous-ass actors and directors who get paid obscenely extravagant amounts of money for making movies that are mostly garbage are complaining about how hard they work. After they work hard they then take several months [or years] off to recuperate. These buffoons haven't worked in the real world in so long [if they ever did] that they no longer remember what it's really like. There are multitudes of jobs that require sleepless nights that are far more dangerous and don't offer even remotely close to the amount of money that these self-obsessed people earn + the five-star treatment they get off of the set. I personally have worked jobs where I worked 18-24 hours a day for months on end and didn't earn what some of these people make in an hour. They deserve neither our sympathy nor our respect."
4,Very Good Overview of Ramsey Lewis major hits 4 1/2 satrs,"The greates hits of Ramsey Lewis is a swining collection of some of Ramsey Lewis' most popular hits. Ramsey Lewis is famous for remaking pop standards and giving them a swinging jazz sound. The studio tracks are good but what really makes this CD stand strong are the live cuts. It's magical to hear the the crowd sing the chorus on hang on sloopy. Standout cuts: The In crowd, My babe A hard days night, hang on sloopy, Wade in the water, high heeled sneakers"
2,Hip is Relative,"Sorry, if hip is hanging out at ... After Dark by the fake fireplace snapping my fingers with Hef, Buddy Hackett and Nipsey Russell, then this album is hip. I'll keep listening (but please, not to Hang on Sloopy) and let you know if I change my mind. Right now, though, these non-descript, formulaic arrangements are indistinguishable to my little mind."
4,Overlooked Gem,Definitely a beautiful album. I stumbled across this years ago down here in Australia and has constantly seen the laser in my CD player ever since. Introductions to friends have always been positive.
2,Spend a Little More and Get an Illustrated Copy...,"I checked out Racketty-Packetty House from the library. It was a sweet story and my 7 year old daughter loved it. She read it in one sitting. Her reading level is 5th grade. This edition is a thin paperback with pretty small type and no illustrations. I did expect that for $2.50, but I had hoped for a little larger type and a few black and white illustrations. There aren't any. So, I wouldn't recommend this edition. The stories and vocabulary in this book are great for advanced 2nd and 3rd graders, but not with this size type.Instead, I'd recommend this edition of the Racketty-Packetty House:The Racketty-Packetty House: 100th Anniversary EditionThe illustrator who illustrated this book also illustrated the Cobble Street Cousins books by Cynthia RylantA Little Shopping: Ready-for-Chapters (Cobble Street Cousins), which I'd also recommend for young girls this age range. They're very sweet early chapter books."
1,Important design omitted,"Very poor shipping packaging considering its weight and delicate panel finish. Received two units, the second having worse damage than the first. I imagine it's a formidable cooler for the price, but that's as far as I can go. Returned both units."
5,Wonderful Book,"My daughter and I love this book. She received it as a present last year and we read it often. With the holiday season fast approaching, this would make an excellent gift for a child."
3,Lundell compilation,Decent but no more compilation from a great songwriter. Buy the albums instead if you are interested since they make more sense.
4,Great but no extras!,Very big fan of KOTH. This series is terrific but there are no extras which was really disappointing.....
4,Each DVD double-sided,Each dvd is double-sided. 4 episodes on each side. They don't mention to flip the disc over for the other episodes. Thought it'd be good to make a note of it here.
2,bad disk little help.,The third disc side 2 of the box it has no info on it won't play it all and I can't figure out how to get a return!
5,one of my personal favorites,i absolutely love this season! it has me laughing over anover again! Episodes such as when bobby takes in a rabid racoon and dale tries to exterminate it! Also when hank and the gang goes to a focus group on the new mason mower! trust me youll love it!
5,"I'D MARRY A MAN LIKE HANK HILL, I TELL YOU WHAT!!!","Needless to say I was really looking forward to adding season 4 to my King of the Hill collection!!! This set contains some of my all-time favorite episodes, like the two part episode titled Hanky Panky, which included guest voices of Kathleen Turner and Reese Witherspoon. I could'nt stop from laughing when Hank had his first phone-sex conversation and he actually felt dirty! I just could'nt take it when Mrs. Strickland made Hank where those short shorts as part of his Manager uniform and the guys in the office called him a boytoy!!! Naturally Peggy gets even more full of herself and you just can't help loving her for being such an overachiever know-it-all! The Country Fanfair episode that included Randy Travis is just hilarious!!!Eventhough Peggy got on everybody's nerves during the bus trip, Hank continued to encourage his wife's obnoxious behavior, now who would'nt want to marry a great guy like Hank Hill!!!!!"
5,perfect solution,The perfect solution to having food bits going down the drain when you don't want to jam up your plumbing. It fits the drain perfectly and is good looking.
3,works well...but rusts,"This strainer fits on out sink well and does its job of preventing food from going down the drain and clogging the pipes. However, after only a few weeks it is starting to rust, so although it may state that its stainless steel, it may not be very high quality stainless steel. But, unless there is a better strainer out there I will stick with this one."
1,Junk,"I really don't feel I should even give this product one star....one star is one too many!! Would not recommend this product to anyone. Customer service was equally disappointing. The cheap steel rusted immediatly, no help from them."
1,Danco Dud...,"Disappointed in this product works great for catching food, but I have had it in my sink for only about two weeks and it is stating to RUST on the underside already???? This was made to be a stainless steel kitchen mesh why is it rusting in less than two weeks?"
4,"A little hard to clean, but effective","I got this when we moved from a place with a garbage disposal to one with no disposal and a septic system. I wanted mesh rather than big holes...otherwise what's the point, right? Does a good job of catching all the bits of food we rinse off plates. I can never get it 100% clean when I empty it because tiny bits stick to the mesh, but it doesn't really bother me. We've had one for almost 6mo and it's not rusted or damaged at all."
2,Clogs quickly,"Very simply put, this mesh strainer clogs easily and quickly. Leaving you with a sink full of water. Look for alternatives. Would not recommend."
5,Exactly what we wanted,Very simple metal mesh strainer for the kitchen sink. Looks good in a stainless sink and works exactly as advertised. Easy to clean. Can't speak for how long it will last. But for the price it's easy to replace after a few months if needed.
5,Just the thing for septic tanks,"This device fits in a standard kitchen sink drain. It has the advantage of allowing water to flow out the sides when the bottom is clogged, unlike the traditional sink stopper. You shouldn't let too much fiber get into your septic system as such material will not be digested quickly by the septic bacteria and lead to your sediment tank getting full. Then comes a several hundred dollar pump out. That is why septic systems and garbage disposals are a no-no. This device is a cheap way to keep your drains flowing."
2,Rust! Stainless??,"I have purchased two of these screens (Danco 88822) at different times and they both have shown coffee stain type rusting (China)? ""KItchenworks"" sells a 4.5"" Stainless screen made in Germany- #181085 $4.50."
3,Functional but rusts...,"Great price for this drain cover but I guess you get what you pay for as I've used this cover for a few weeks and already noticed two rust spots on a ""stainless"" product."
5,kumquat,"I was not sure that this item will fit my kitchen sink, but it fit. This is a good item for the kitchen drain."
3,down the drain,didn't work forme...my fault ...its to small for the average drain..make sure you measure...but me thinks even if it fit the brim is not wide enough..and its really average at best..don't buy it
4,Perfect for beginners,"I was looking for a good laser book tried svelto, siegman but they were written at a comparatively higher level, so I found this book, boy! what a relief. I guess the best part of the book is that the author doesn't stress too much on mathematics, electromagnetics or advanced optics. Moreover the early chapters deals with all the fundamentals required to understand lasers (that is covered in later chapters)Bottomline: If you need a quick yet thorough introduction to lasers, this is the book."
2,Wait for the next edition.,"Laser Fundamentals exchanges mathematical rigor for many real-world examples. The problems sets are easy and some what ambiguous at times. There are several typographical errors in the main text, equations, and figures. Overall the book is best served as a beginner's reference or a senior-level text. The next edition should be much better."
2,Laser Fundamentals 2nd ed paperback,"Something must be wrong with all I am ordering these days.I just bought this book for use in class. The book just arrived.Somehow many of the figures are missing in this text. I am at loss for words now.Just sent one email to Cambridge press if they could help with the figures. Let's see what happens.Amazon.com: kindly check if other copies you have are the same, i.e., missing many figures throughout."
1,Undergrad EE,"This book is lacking on examples. Sections will drag on for pages with no examples whatsoever. Some of the questions at the end of the chapters, seemingly, have nothing to do with the chapter whatsoever. I would not recommend this course to someone who intends to learn what they need from the book. The index is also a terrible reference. The text also needs to repeat what some variables are. Often times the author will introduce a new variable or a variable with an augmented subscript and not explain what it is. How frustrating.....!"
3,OK,"The Mozart flute and harp concerto was not what it could have been. Although the harp is impressive, the flute, which frequently carries the melody and is largely responsible for the emotional expression, is sometimes lost when it should have been foregrounded. The tenderness of the melody is unclear in the slow movement whenever it cadences, a real loss."
4,The best for new plants,If you clone or transplant you need this. It definitely helps the plant in the early stage and gets those roots growing with shock.
2,Not as complete as expected,"This unit does not include brackets, to mount a 3.5 inch disk drive, or a face plate to cover the front opening, if a 3.5 inch drive was installed. This enclosure is to mount a 5.25 inch device (cd-rom) only, as packaged."
1,Worst HP CD,"This was the worst Harry Potter CD ever. John Williams really knows what he is doing.The other cds at least played the music in the order of the events from the movie. This one jumps all over the place.The sound goes from so low you can't hear it so that you have to raise the volume to so loud that it hurts your ears. Most of the time I feel like I'm listening to nothing.For the next cd, they need to get John Williams back. Even if the movies are darker, the music can still sound like HP music. The theme song wasn't there at all.Sorry I bought this CD"
2,Time to BRING BACK JOHN WILLIAMS!!,"Sadly, this soundtrack turned many of John Williams' beautiful themes into death marches and left nothing new to be desired. It was much like a bunch of sound effects rather than a score meant to tie the movie together into an artistic whole. Obviuosly, Warner Brothers is trying to make the Harry Potter movies as cheap as possible since they know the fans will come no matter how poorly they make the films. John Williams has said that he would love to do Harry Potter again, and they need him to strengthen his wonderful themes to tie all the movies together before it's too late."
4,Sounds like Magic,"I think Hooper's really grown into his role as composer for the Harry Potter series. This soundtrack really enlivens the movie. Prof. Umbridge's theme is great - the perfect mix between control-freak and 1950s female stereotype. The finale with Voldemort has the right poignancy to show that this isn't simply a battle of wands and spells, but rather the triumph of hope over evil. I look forward to seeing how Hooper interprets the future films."
2,Definitely Different,"I don't mean to dwell on the past, but Nicholas Hooper's music just doesn't seem to fit the Harry Potter films that we have come to love. The genius of John Williams and Patrick Doyle is definitely not matched in this ""themeless"" soundtrack. While change can be good, a composer such as Hans Zimmer may have been a better, more traditional choice. The Potter films have given rise to a modern classical style of music that rock-loving teenagers actually enjoy (something not seen since the Star Wars music accompanied the big-screen flicks). The new sound Hooper brings may represent the changes occurring in the wizarding world; however, it is more noise than music and lacks any sense of continuity."
2,Not much there,"I am simply not impressed with this soundtrack. There is nothing to it. Some tracks you could barely notice that there was even music. Sorry, if you enjoyed the music from earlier films, you will be a bit disappointed."
3,Adequate and workmanlike,"just like Patrick Doyle's work for the fourth film...the problem is that John Williams is an almost impossible act to follow and neither of the non-Williams scores quite captures the magic in the same way. Think about it for a second, when you say ""Harry Potter"" and think of music, it's ""Hedwig's Theme"" that bursts into your mind...yes?"
2,Horrible,"All I can say is this. If the producers want the last two movies to do well, one of the main things they need to do is get a decent composer. Seriously, do absolutely whatever it takes to get John Williams back, or get James Horner, or Howard Shore, or Danny Elfman. Really, anyone that is a serious film score composer and knows how to write for an epic action adventure movie. Stop hiring people whose only credits are writing jingles for stupid TV shows.Not related to the score, they need to also get a real director who has had experience with large film budgets. Get Spielberg or Bruckheimer to produce it. And please, please, PLEASE recast Dumbledore. Michael Gambon may be a great gangster, but he is a horrible Dumbledore."
2,The soundtrack made for Muzak.,"I found it mildly amusing that my first thought, prior to reading other reviews here, was ""John Williams has clearly left the building."" This score was adequate as filler for a movie, but lacked any of the charm and creativity that was evident in the soundtracks from the first three films. In fact, elements from Mr. Williams' compositions have been used in this score as well. Each listener will have different tastes. For myself, I found 2 tracks to be something I would want to keep in my library, which is not really enough to warrant buying the CD.If you are a hardcare Harry Potter fan, then this CD should also appeal to you.This soundtrack can really be summed up as filler and music that is fit to listen to in an elevator. Unlike Mr. Williams' scores, which have been played on classical music radio, this one will not.In short: Save your money. Buy the individual tracks that you like, and the DVD when it is released."
3,its okay,"I think Hooper is a step up from the dribble of GOF. Of course he is no John Williams (who should come back by the way) but I think he needs to be cut a break. I am not a collector of movie soundtracks though I do look them up from time to time. The only reason why I even looked up the Harry Potter soundtracks is because of Williams, and then when I heard Hooper's ""Flight of the Order of the Phoenix"" which I enjoyed immensely. He does his job as a composer which is to emphasize the scenes in the movie. ""Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning"" is a good track considering it has that sugary sweetness quality with a paradoxical underlayer of uneasiness, discomfort, and something not so nice- just like the character of Dolores Umbridge herself. It is very fitting. As a soundtrack I think it works, despite the weird presence of a guitar in ""Fireworks""...."
2,eeeaaaaaa,"it was'nt the best, and it could of been better it was alwright. the first two was a lot better then this one in my own words.bring back john williams"
1,SKIP IT,"With all the incredible talent out there, why this guy was selected for the score reminds us that directors and the guys in the suits usually don't know anything about the power of REAL film music.Stick to TV shows, Mr. Hopoper."
1,No Reminiscing Here :[,"Like so many others have said, this soundtrack has none of the charm of the other ones. It fits the movie well enough while you're watching, but if you listen to it independently, you're not going to have any flashbacks. None of this music is going to get stuck in your head."
3,Order of the Phoenix,Not as good as previous 4 CDs. The tracks were out of sequence with the scenes from the movie.
3,Out Of Order,"Why do these tracks have to be out of order? I really hate that!The music is ok, could use more of the original themes to suit me though, I guess don't mess with success.If anyone has a better order to these tracks (the order they are in the movie) please list it - that would be nice."
4,"Refreshing, diverse, and exciting to the last note!","After listening to some disappointing soundtracks from the Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the dreadful Goblet of Fire soundtrack, it was quite refreshing to listen to and finally hear this soundtrack. As we listened to each selection, we were able to visualize the scene in the movie that it portrayed. In fact, this soundtrack enhanced the movie and created the mood of the scene at hand.My only two suggestions would have been to rearrange the selections in chronological order and to have made Umbridge's theme just a little more wicked and dark.I hope that Nicholas Hooper's next soundtrack for Half Blood Prince is just as invigorating."
3,NOT another portal into Harry Potter's world....,"If you're looking for good music, buy this CD. However, if you are looking for another portal into the world of Harry Potter...save your money.I honestly could care less who writes the score as long as their score measures up to the film. Unfortunately, both film and score is lacking...What I loved the most about watching the Harry Potter movies is that it was like I was reading the books...I was there in that magical world. Same with listening to the scores, I felt like I was in a world full of magic, good and evil, mystery...I didn't sense it in either the film or score.As weird as this may sound, Hooper's score for the Order of the Phoenix is actually some pretty good music...it's just not worthy of having the title as a Harry Potter score."
2,"Could be Harry Potter, Could be any PBS/BBC production...","I was sad because I really like Patrick Doyle's music, who composed Goblet of Fire. And of course John Williams is great as well. There is very little John Williams source material here, Another Story has a taste of previous themes, then quickly abandoned. A Journey To Hogwarts also offers previous themes. The opening track on the new album has this electric guitar solo, that just sounds wrong, not in keeping with the Harry Potter world at all. This is a very different score and it's not my favorite. Nicholas Hooper has scored many movies and television shows, but ones you likely haven't heard of. Most of this sounds as if it cold have been from any one of those shows. I understand that John Williams didn't want to spend the rest of his career scoring Harry movies. This may be the weakest score yet. IMDB lists him for Half-Blood Prince as well, that's sad. Hopefully Williams will return for the final episode."
2,No magic here--weak and disappointing,"Following the sparkling, evocative efforts of Williams and Doyle, this is a generic, dull offering, and certainly brings no magic to the film. It lacks depth and emotional resonance, and actually would work better as background music for a TV movie. Sounds like the composer had little or no visceral connection to the film or to the story and its characters. It's sad to think they've given Hooper the next film to score as well; if neither of the previous composers is available, call in Howard Shore or even James Newton Howard before it's too late. Blah; save your money on this one."
2,Only for die-hard collectors,"I admit, I am a die-hard collector of all things Harry Potter, so I can't be too upset with my purchase, but this CD is NOT something I listen to for the fun of it. It doesn't compare to John Williams' editions at all (despite previous reviews stating it comes close). Let's hope the rumors that John will come back for HP7 are true!!!"
3,Disappointment.,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a great soundtrack. But this one was not. It rambled all over the map. Did not follow any kind of order. I've enjoyed all the soundtracks, continuing to replaying them over and over. This one had some good tracks but nothing outstanding. I was so looking forward to it and to be let down so disgusted me."
5,BEAUTIFUL AND FABULOUS ALBUM,"This is relaxing and beautiful music. Every single song is great. I love ""full moon"" and ""stream"" with the nature sounds and flute but all these songs are tremendous, sweet and mind-transporting."
4,Classic vintage girls' mystery still engrossing today.,"Augusta Huiell Seaman was a very prolific author, who wrote 39 books between 1911 and 1949. Her books were very popular for many years after she wrote them, and were reprinted over and over again- but now most of them have become hard to find. The Boarded-Up House was her 4th book, and her first mystery for girls. It remains one of her most loved and sought after books. There is a wonderful blending of both a historical mystery and a contemporary one (contemporary, that is, to 1915). At the time Seaman began writing her mysteries, no one else had written suspenseful stories for older girls and boys - and for 90 years now, once Seaman's books are discovered, they are loved."
5,The Boarded Up House,I first fell in love with this child's mystery story by Augusta Huiell Seaman when in elementary school while attending a one room grade school. I was happy to have found an ancient copy of it for my granddaughters and I enjoyed rereading this historical mystery again just as much now as grandmother.
5,Exciting and surprising!!!,"White Dynamite and Curly Kid is a book that is as much fun to read as it is to listen to! The story is terrific, full of action and suspense as Curly Kid watches cowboys ride a fearsome bull known as White Dynamite! The ending is a surprise to all, as the reader learns that things aren't always as they seem.Zinthia Halaychik, Astatula, Florida"
5,can't go wrong!...,The item was as described. Great condition and well packed for shipping. Arrived in a timely fashion. Would recommend to anyone. Good experience!
3,Muy buen libro,"Es un muy buen libro. Trata los aspectos del Zen relacionado con el antiguo TE y KOBUDO. Referente a la historia, podr√≠a haber sido un poco m√°s profundo, pero el nivel es satisfactorio."
4,Multiplpe play options.,"We bought this toy for our nine-month-old son. First, it comes with two green coin-shaped sortable pieces that are right on the ragged edge of chokable, so we put those up. Some of the other pieces can fit through multiple holes, for instance, the yellow cilinders can go through the round hole or the square hole. This drives my husband nuts, but I like it because it means my son can be successful in putting a piece through a hole even though he is not perfect. When he's a little older he'll get the concept of round-through-round, but for now he's not frustrated. (We also stick clothespins through the holes.) It also has a mail slot for pretend play when he gets even older. It's a very sturdy little all-wood mailbox, and very cute."
2,Hovhaness needs more maturity,"I was very dissapointed when I heard this album. The sound is tinny, strident, and unbalanced. I can imagine how hard it is for unfunded orchestras to make recordings, but this sounds like a scraggly bunch of pickup players who play with no soul. Hovhaness demands a fuller, burnished tone. Even worse than the poor sound quality and sketchy intonation is the lack of a sense of flexibility and nuance. The hollowness of the playing would not be so offensive if there were a feeling of expansiveness, languidness, or generousity. I can't help thinking the composer would be very saddened by this effort. I hope Mr. Clark's realizes someday that music is not something that can be hammered out like a wall street stock deal. The kind of crassness on display here is better suited to commerce or (lamentably), politics."
1,Poor Shipping Container!! BEWARE,"Beware if you order this item - I received the wine cooler in horrible shape. The shipping box is flimsy and was crushed and punctured. The box was left on my front doorstep so I did not get to look at it before it was dropped off.The packing material was poor and the top of the unit being plastic was broken. Now, to get a replacement, I need to repack with the shredded packing materials and put it in the crushed box, and then bring it to UPS (all 60 pounds of it)! Amazon is providing the return shipping label.I will think twice before ordering such a large and heavy item."
1,Horrible packaging,"I wish I listened to the previous review. The cooler was packaged (if you can call it that) in a box with maybe 1/4 inch of foam pads. Basically it arrived with its door broken off and some other pieces floating in the box. I've ordered heavy items before, but this is the first time I see it packaged so poorly. The cooler itself may be very good, but I am yet to see one shipped in a condition that is acceptable."
1,Arrived totally mangled,"Yes, yes... all the stories ARE true! We too used overnight shipping to try to lessen the likelihood of receiving a mangled mess, and we received a mangled mess. We had to send back the first one and wait for a second, slightly less damaged version to arrive."
2,Will be Delivered damaged!,Come on...you think after all the returns and reviews that they would have figured this out. I will have to return this mangled mess and I cant see myself re-ordering. For what ever its worth it does look good other than the 7 huge chips out of the top and the internal broken hinges.PS The box didnt have a scratch on it-Go figure!
2,Hassle,"I bought this as a wedding gift for someone and it arrived missing a piece of the latch or hinge for the door. It was a pain for them to get the missing part. I believe they had to go through the manufacturer and it took quite some time. I think it they get what they needed (or they stopped updating me about it), but it was rather embarrassing giving a gift to someone only to have it turn into a huge mess for them to deal with."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"This cooler arrived damaged in its hole-ridden, poorly packed manufacturer's box. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that shipping something this heavy without the proper box spells D A M A G E D goods. To add insult to injury, the cooler is missing a shelf. Jeff Bezos needs to add ""common sense"" to his X-mas wishlist because his shipping department is in great need of some!"
1,I wasn't told about delays,This item shipped over a month later than I thought it would - at the time of purchase I wasn't even advised that the item was not in stock - basically I didn't have it on time in the summer when it was most needed. The product itself is fine but I was very disappointed with the service.
1,I ordered Antec 7 but received Antec 5.,"This is more of a fulfillment comment than a product comment, but I ordered Antec 7 but received Antec 5. I had researched thee products and knew the "" Antec 5"" was not as well-rated as the ""Antec 7."" It wasn't worth the hassle to return it... and so I bought an equivalent product, Artic Silver 5, elsewhere."
3,re: ontario,"One shouldn't place stock in what was indeed a horrible movie. 'Total Eclipse' does nothing for a true admirer of Rimbaud. Rimbaud was not flamboyantly gay--he was a hedonist, therefore he was bi-sexual. If you really want to know about Rimbaud, I suggest you pick up a copy of Enid Starkie's book. There you will find all you need. I have nothing more to say to you--you disinterest me...."
1,Not a good product,I purchased this product and some of the outlets do not work. It makes my light and clock flicker.
4,Or if you own an old pickup or tractor or.....,"This is a response to the above reviewer who found the book useless. A lot of people still have old tractors, pickups or cars older than 20 years. Also, any late model fuel injected car can run 50% alcohol with no problem. If you use Swifty brand gas, you are already using 10% ethanol. Plus, if you can't afford to put gas in that big block Chevy to cruise around in, remember that top fuel dragsters and indy cars both run on alcohol. Plus, the hi-compression motors of the old days love this stuff. Stills are pretty easy to make. I have a friend that brews up his own moonshine on the stove with a converted pressure cooker."
1,Another waste of money and time,This is another example of someone trying to make money by marketing old ideas in a time when the ethanol industry is on the verge of a major contribution to alternative fuels. The trouble with this book and so many others like it is that the author has not updated the book to keep up with technological advancements in the alternative fuels field. This book is totally useless in the 21st cenbtury unless maybe you own a 1955 Edsel with a carburetor.
4,Incredible Recording,"I have been searching for years for a Patsy Cline recording with this music on it. I'm not a country-western fan in particular, but this is so enjoyable you can't not like it. We play this one over and over again and sing along with Patsy. Great traveling music! There isn't a bad song on it."
5,I finally got this copy,"After various trys to find this cd, i gave up a while back.I found this quite by accident and immediately ordered it.This was to be a gift!It was so well received. Great shipping time - a few days. The packaging was good, and the case is good. The unit plays really well.So the gift was a success!Thank you"
5,this is the best,this is the best pasty cline cd i've bought it has a lot of great songs on there and the sound is awesome but they didn't put all the songs from the movie on it but it is still awesome
4,worth listening,"though this is an old record, but it is still worth listening, esp the title "" Crazy"" now seems become popular again."
4,Why change the background?,"The soundtrack is great, because of Patsy's voice. I don't understand why they had to change the background for the movie- All they had to do was use the original 4-Star material that Patsy recorded. Maybe they weren't able to do so, due to copywrights and such. Whatever the case, even if I like the original backgrounds better, they are an interesting change. My favorite track is ""San Antiono Rose."" It's always been one of my favorite Patsy songs and it sounds great with an alternate background. I recommend this album to add to your Patsy collection if you are a fan!!"
5,Sweet Dreams CD (Patsy Cline),"I received my Sweet Dreams CD well within the range of time that was given. Service was prompt, and I was delighted with the product. I had been looking for this CD for at least a year and finally found this at a reasonable price. It was new with the manufacturer's seal. I love Patsy Cline, and this was truly a bargain for me."
5,Very Pleased,Item recieved in a timely manner. Bought as a gift. Recipiant very pleased. Very good condition.
4,great deal IF,"This was a great deal, but it would not play on any of the dvd players in my home. It may have been a bad copy, but I didnt take the chance. Sorry"
3,It works okay but...,"I have mixed feelings about this punch. My expectations were high because I like most of my McGills brand punches and this one didn't live up to those expectations.It cuts through stiff paper just fine, and makes nice even slots for weaving ribbon or paper through so it works for the bags I wanted it for.Pros:The soft handles are easy to gripThe trap works just fine on minedeep throat makes it work for most applicationsCuts nicely through the paper weights that I wanted to use it withCons:Handles felt a bit stiff which made it harder to useHave to squeeze hard to get through card stocknot really designed for very small handstrap is badly designed. It started out tight and got looser the more it was usedI'll use this on the paper bag projects that I got it for, but that's about it.A tip to keep your slots the same depth and even- use tape to mark a line inside the throat of the punch, then you can line up on that to keep your slots even."
1,This is a horrible punch!,This is the worst paper punch I have ever tried to use. It is not sharp enough to punch through cardstock and will barely punch through regular paper. It also left black marks on the paper. The part that should hold the small pieces of punched paper does not fit tight enough to hold them in the reservoir so you end up with little pieces of paper all over the place. This is being returned and I will have to try my luck with another brand.
5,must have crafters tool,great crafters tool.easy comfortable to hold and good value.a real asset to any card maker
5,The perfect and professional guide to writing for orchestra,"Having used this book for many years I continue to be impressed with its thoroughness and the scope of its musical examples. No composer can live without it, and it surpasses all previous books on the subject"
5,MUSICAL KNOWLEGE,"The book ""THE TECHNIQUE OF ORCHESTRATION"" is very easy to comprehend. The authors Kent Kennan and Donald Grantham seemed to have covered everything necessary to help in composing fundamentals and easy to advance further in your composing.I would recommend this book to all who want to study orchestration.Ruth Lenher"
3,Good book... but expensive,"It has a nice amount of information, but the price could be half what is costs, considering its size. It is useful, but I see no reason why it costs so much. Half the price should be the right amount, this is the reason it only gets three stars. The problem is: technical books are too expensive, if you check other books in the same subject (music, orchestration, composition, harmony) you will see for yourself."
4,Good Service,"The book was in excellent condition, but there was a faint odor to it. Nothing obnoxious, and it is not too noticeable."
1,Disappointed,We had hoped this would help our high-strung cat. We'll never know since she won't eat it. I even tried disguising it in gravy but she wouldn't touch it.
4,Pretty Dang Decent!,"I love these headphones! They are affordable with decent quality sound. My only complaints would be the extremely long cord, which is understandable but a little too long for me, and the fact that the cushions come off a little too easily."
5,excelent pair of headphones,Simple - I don't think you can get anything better For $20. Plus the 11ft cord makes it perfect for PC use. Don't expect too much Bass. But sound is definitely acceptable. Great item for the price.
4,Awesome for the price.,"Even though I got 50-something percent off, paying $45 for these headphones is a steal. The lows are great, not too strong, but the highs seem a little shallow, but its not that big of a deal. The earmuffs are extremely comfortable, but they do make your ears a little hot. The only thing I can't stand about these headphones is the 11.5 foot cable."
3,Lasted 10 days,"I purchased this for my 5 year old to use on the computer. They sounded just fine, but could not handle the wear and tear. The cord got shredded very quickly. A little too fragile for our use."
3,"Good sound, but uncomfortable","These headphones sound great but hurt my ears when I wear glasses, and my hair also gets caught and pulled by them, so I don't really use them."
4,"Great value for this price, both sound and build quality!","I bought this headphones 1 year ago and still they are like new. there are several things I want to mention:1. Size: if you like headphones that have form factor like this, you will be very happy. size is very good, it's not heavy, it sits fine on the head & covers years firmly2. Build Quality: quality is fantastic! It's very solid, it's made from quality plastic, parts are assembled well. Overall it's very solid & strong headphones3. Sound Quality: for this price, it's much more better than other headphones in same price range. Low, Mid & High frequencies sound very clear & over time sound quality stays the same.Also I'm very happy with its very wire, which you can get anywhere.Overall you will be very happy with this headphone, in this price range."
4,Tightly Crafted But Swinging,"Gateway is a trio comprising John Abercrombie, guitar; Dave Holland, bass; and Jack DeJohnette, drums and piano. All three of these fine musicians have been featured on numerous CDs over the years, but when they cut this CD, they had not recorded together for more than a decade, thus the title, Homecoming. Judging from the energy and spirit of the music on this disk, all three truly enjoyed getting back together, and they have produced a CD that is tightly crafted yet still swinging. This is not music that grabs the listener immediately; instead, it takes a few listens to really get into the deeper beauty and appeal of the musicians' interplay."
3,Lennon's Life-from the eyes of his tarot card reader,"John Lennon was a very intriguing man, but most people do not know about all of the many events that happened with his career, as well as his personal life. John Green knew what was going on inside Lennon's head. This book clearly describes incidents in his life that many of his fans never knew. John Green wrote this book in order that people could get to know the real John Lennon, although he is now dead. The book started out about four or five years before John Lennon's death, and the book ended just after his untimely death. If anyone wants to know the real story of John Lennon's life, ""Dakota Days"" by John Green would definately be the book to read. No one else, not even his wife Yoko seemed to know exactly what was going on in the musicians head as well as John Green did. This was a good book when the facts are concerned, but the information was a little confusing."
3,Another piece of the puzzle,"John Green was Lennon's tarot card reader in the late seventies, and for what it's worth, here's his two cents. He chooses to create dialogue sequences as he remembers them, which may or may not be very accurate, but at least they give a pretty good idea of Lennon's personality towards him."
1,Another cash-in rip-off,"I've read numerous books on John Lennon and this ranks among the worst. It is just another cash-in rip-off in the line of Albert Goldman, Fred Seaman etc. Green wants to convince the reader he had a very close relationship with Lennon, could see inside his head, and pretends to remember their discussions accurately, word by word. He depicts Lennon and Ono as completely unbalanced, insecure, restless, child-like characters who never knew what they really wanted. And of course, the tarot-card reader Green was always there to give wise, fatherly advice so that those two poor creatures wouldn't have messed up their lives completely. If you really want to understand Lennon to the extent it is possible, I suggest you read Anthony Elliott's excellent psychological analysis ""The Mourning of John Lennon""."
5,Awesome,"Excellent study for missional community (small group).John Piper has a special way of reminding us of the holiness of God and how the Bible is continuously teaching us ""GOD IS THE GOSPEL"""
4,Poultry of the World - Very Special !,A very good book with a lot of information for everyone in the poultryworld - utility and fanciers. Many items were touches. A total other book than ever published before. Because all the international photowork difficult to value the pictures but many are good.
3,easy read,"I liked this book. However I don't think I got much out of it.PROS: It's a easy read. Most people will probably find a little gem of information or have a 'ah ha' moment that will help them with their office politics.CONS: The words ""SECRETS to WINNING at office politics"", ""how to achieve your goals"" and ""increase your influence at work"" are overstated. You can't read a book like this and get what's printed on the cover. There's way way way more to it than that."
5,"A ""must read"" for every professional!","I read this book before staring my new job. I feel more prepared than ever for what I need to do to be successful. This book was so thorough and content-rich, I put tabs in it and carry it with me to work . . . just in case I need to reference something or need a ""refresher course"". I recommend this book for seasoned professionals as well as those just entering the workforce!"
4,evocative music that grows on you,"I was in San Francisco a few months back and caught a Blanket show. The live performance was tight and I picked up a copy of Ever Wanted. Although its only 5 songs long, its packed with great songs. The first two, Ever Wanted and Never Said Goodbye are really strong and seem to get better with every listening. You can really hear the Bob Mould/Guided By Voices influences.If you package this EP with their earlier self-titled EP, you've got one of the better full-length indie albums to come out of the Bay Area in a while. Unwinding off that earlier EP is definitely one of my favorite songs, with an emo chorus that blows you away.If these guys get picked up by a major label (which should be soon if there's any justice) and get some money to make a full length CD, the results would really be impressive."
2,You really had to be there!,"Back at Univ. of FLA in the 1970's my roomates and I listened to all of the JB albums, as he gave quite a number of free shows for the students back then. I was and still am a true fan. I havn't heard this album for about 20 years, but the thing I remember is that my roomates & I agreed the title was an inside joke and JB must have put this out as some sort of contract obligation with the record company. The song list is great, but the studio versions shine. Buy the real studio versions, such as A1A and/or A White Sport Coat & A Pink Crustacean."
4,Why don't we get drunk and screw,"Hello : ). I am interested in getting the lyrics to this song. I have a group of friends that I met in a bar and we all get together in a group and sing this song. When I first heard the song, I thought it was hysterical. Not everyone knew the words to the song. I would like to learn the words and be able to fit in with the group. This is my only intention. I would really appreciate this. Please and Thank you Mary Platt. E-mail address is: mplatt1960@aol.com"
1,Bummer,Bought a used CD and I only got the first disc. The songs on the first disc sounded like the old Buffett concerts I remember. Been going to JB concerts around the country since the early 80's .... Would have like to have gotten the second disc to complete the set.....I have second thoughts about buying anything used again.....
3,Not a good live album!,"Do not buy this if you want to hear music! But if you want to hear JB sermonize this is perfect. The songs are particularly short, and I think there is more of Jimmy talking than making music. If you want good live JB music making try Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays or Feeding Frenzy. Both are original and full of great JB classics. But get this one if you want to hear drunk Jimmy giving a speech, which is what I'm not looking for, though it is also very entertaining."
4,Essential Text for Everyday Japanese,"ATTENTION! This book is out of print! If you can find a copy, snatch it up QUICK!First an introduction: I am a new Japanese language student struggling to balance enthusiasm and accuracy and limit discouragement!This little book contains practically all of the Kanji compounds used in everyday newspaper and magazines within Japan and abroad. The combination of the compound Kanji, romajii and closest English equivalent really helps in understanding the individual Kanji themselves and how the individual characters' meaning is subtlety changed when accompanied by a second and/or third character.There is also a chapter by chapter quiz section included for self-testing (though I haven't used this feature too often).Recommended reading as well as a luggage item 'because you never know when you'll need it'."
5,A Wonderful film,"I just watched this version of the classic tale, and I am moved to tears. Forget what others here have said commenting on the animation, and pay attention to the story. The animation was superb with great use of shading and cg blends.More importantly, this film has heart. It emotes. It conveys with power the ideals Dickens intended in his tale. Honor Christmas everyday. Keep its meaning and joy in your heart.The only other animated film I have ever seen that comes close to this level of stroy telling and emotion is Grave of the Fireflies.Buy this one. You will not be dissapointed. Share it with the family. Watch it on Christmas Eve. Watch it in July. Watch it whenever.~William Nichols~"
2,Forgettably Poor,"The only thing I remember about this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is that the animation is so poor that I have no intention of watching it again, so I've made a note to self not to watch or recommend the Simon Callow/Kate Winslet/Nicolas Cage version. I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage, but I didn't even recognize his voice in this animated flop."
2,Bah Humbug!!,"I received this dvd yesterday and have attempted to watch it 3 times and just cannot become interested in it. I have always been a huge Christmas cartoon fan and Christmas fan in general but this movie completely bores me and lacks the feeling of other versions that I have seen.I gave it two stars for the theatrical beginning and ending being included in special features as I honestly enjoyed them, but the movie itself simply felt flat to me. To each his own though and if you decide to purchase this dvd I hope that you enjoy it. It just isn't one that I can recommend."
5,Love this animated version of Christmas Carol!,"I saw this movie on cable and tried to find it on Netflix but they didn't have it so I looked for it on Amazon. I was thrilled to find it! I love this animated version of the Charles Dickens classic and the music is wonderfully done. I love the video, ""What If"" by Kate Winslet and can watch it over and over and over and never tire of it. I was also thrilled to find the movie soundtrack on Amazon and purchased it too! Thanks for making my Christmas the merriest!"
3,Nothing Special,"My girlfriend reports that the Suave Naturals Vanilla is not as good (requires more for effective cleaning) as Sauve Clarifying for her long thin un-tinted hair. The purchase was made primarily for the scent implied by the name since we both like vanilla. Though subjective, to us the odor is dominated by a coconut-like overtone followed by an astringent dime-a-dozen floral/herbal everbody-has-it scent that we both find repulsive. It was ordered because it was not available locally. It was not worth the effort and will not be purchased again."
5,Let It Snow piano music,I was so thrilled to be able to purchase the exact sheet music that I played 30 years ago when my son was little. The copy was in great condition and arrived very quickly after I placed my order.
2,Insufficient product information,"After you get the product the packaging states that it is only good for soft, padded dashboards and should not be used on hard, plastic dashboards. This should be listed in the product description above.Also, the packaging indicates that you may end up with a darker spot on your dashboard under this pad as the rest of the dashboard is gradually bleached by the sun. Something to think about...Other than that, it works pretty well. Things stick to it and don't slide horizontally, but can easily be taken off by hand with no residual stickiness left on the item."
3,"works, but beware","There is a warning that on some cars, the backing (part that sticks to the dashboard) might discolor/mar when removed."
3,Dissolves in sunlight,Edges curl and sticky dissolves in sunlight and heat from cars interior. We are near equator and when car is unattended I suspect interior of car reaches 180 degrees or better in direct sunlight. I guess thats like throwing the product in the oven. Other than that it holds the phone in place.
1,10th day of christmas 2011 review,"On the 10th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...WWF Slamfest. Once again another filler. This one has 5 matches this time. Like the other one,there's only one match worth watching and that's the Bret Hart/British Bulldog-Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart/Owen Hart tag team match. The rest: Forget it. I give this tape a 1 out of 10."
3,Depends what you are looking for,"I love all things Starbucks which is why I purchased this book.I was under the impression that this story would be a diary type book, complete with juicy stories of interactions and goings on at Starbucks.This was not the case. This book is basically loaded with all types of information (business-wise mainly) on Starbucks, coffee, and the industry in general. There are some great photographs of various Starbucks stores in various cities in the world.This book is interesting if you are looking for dry facts. If you are looking for anecdotes, cute stories or juicy gossip, this is not the book for you.However, having said that, it is obvious that the author was painstaken about his research and certainly took his subject matter to heart."
4,"[standard bonnie billy fair: god-haunted, great.]","As many have noted, Bonnie Billy is into spurprises and flouting expectations. He's certainly done it here. Its a testament to the performance-artist edge to his music, and to his genius, plain and simple, that this album has the critics so confused. Its a bit wearisome, though, to read one after another of the official, critical reviews complaining that this sounds so melodic and well-produced that it must be some kind of meta-irony. While its certainly true that some of the songs lack something that the original's had (e.g. ""I Am a Cinematographer"" has lost a bit of its original playfully wistful aspect), the fact remains that this is more than just music worth listening to; its music worth listening to, and listening to again, and again. This album has done nothing to alter my not-altogether hyperbolic assessment of Oldham: he's the greatest singer-songwriter since John Donne."
2,Completists Only,"This album is for Will Oldham die hards only (and if you are an Oldham completist, you are a braver man/woman than I). This is also not a good place to start for beginners, they should be directed to works such as 'i see a darkness' and 'viva last blues'. Oldham has taken some of his old Palace songs and reworked them as smooth country songs. Although it is interesting to hear how he has reworked his older songs, I would only get this if you have money just burning a hole in your pocket."
1,Don't Buy Dazzle Products,"We purchased the Dazzle Digital Video Creater II. It has never worked properly and customer service is a joke. You will wait on hold for hours to reach tech support. They want you to use their web site for support but it takes days to get a response. Even after trying all of their suggestions our unit still does not work, but they will not let us send it back under the warranty until we get permission from another customer service number. Guess what, you wait on hold there for hours as well."
1,Un Dazzle,No support. They tell you to wait 3-5 days for an e-mail response. Even after a support call it did not work. Export did not work in standard formats. Do't buy this software !
3,AN OK READ,"FROM THE BACK COVER:One Wild Wedding....Molly Mc Guire struck a bargain with rancher Kane Jackson to help find her missing brother. They would be married in every way - but one! Yet how could she keep her distance from a man whose Cheyenne spirit made her understand what made the West so wild?The last thing Kane Jackson wanted was a wife - especially one who did what she pleased whenever she pleased! But now he was saddled with a coppery-haired bundle of determination and desire named Molly McGuire, who tempted him in many, many ways..."
4,Ice Crusheer,This product is fine except it moves around when I am crushing ice. Itis supposed to have a vacuum base but it does not work or I am doingsomthing wrong. Virginia Ashford
1,Junk,"This item is mostly plastic, and the metal cutting teeth work against plastic stops while the ice is being chopped. After a short time these plastic stops began breaking. Don't waste your money, I was able to pick up a totally metal one elsewhere."
2,Crushes well but RUSTS!,We bought our ice crusher about 6 months ago. Within a couple of weeks the screws started to rush as well as the hinge for the lid and part of the actual crushing mechanism inside. We have just started to wash it off and hand dry as best as we can with each use. The hinge for the lid has just broken due to the rust issue. I don't understand why they would use parts that rust. A shame because it works well. I will not purchase this brand again.
1,Broke in a week!,"Sorry to say, loved this ice crusher for the first week, then crack! The molded plastic where the metal blades sits cracked & broke off. Too bad, I really thought highly of it's ability at first...VERY DISAPPOINTED! Should have invested the money in fixing the ice maker in fridge..."
2,Works,"Crushes the ice, but requires considerable pressure down on the lid and still scoots around the countertop. Jams on big cubes, requiring repeated direction reversals. This can get aggravating, especially if you have a lot of ice to crush. Then again, it does in fact crush it."
2,Liked it at first...,"Worked great for the first 2 months. Then the locking-nut on the end of the shaft fell off. No big deal, just put everything back together and re-tighten the screw. Now, about a year later, the metal pieces are rusting. My opinion, find a model with stainless hardware."
2,stated 5 yr warranty is a hoax,"The packaging states that the product is covered by a 5 year warranty and that, if the product fails due to a defect in material or workmanship, the product can be returned to Swing-A-Way for repair or replacement.After 5 months of use, a large piece of the plastic teeth inside the crusher broke off. I called the manufacturer (Focus Foodservice, LLC, who purchased Swing-A-Way) and was told that they now only deal with distributors and that I would have to return the product to the original seller (i.e., Amazon.com) to obtain a refund or replacement."
1,it breaks,We where happy with it for about one month. I was worried when we got it because it was plastic and metal together. The plastic broke. Had to send it back. I was afraid to try another one for fear that it would break also.
4,Performs as represented.,"It looks good and does its job. It grinds ice cubes into two different sizes - coarse and less coarse. That said, it really does, and that's what its supposed to do."
1,RUST FAST,I bought this only because the reviews were said to be a great product ... and well .. the metal used rusted if not dried right after ... the rust would fall into my crushed ice ... and then after not even month the plastic broke on the product letting the big chunk fall throught!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS !!!!!
4,Ice Crusher,Great product. Just like grandma used to have. It actually works and is built well. Stays securely on the counter with the suction cup and crushes to just the size you want. Does take some muscle in turning the crank though.
4,Impossible love?,"An Israeli, a Palestinian, and an exploration of (im)possible love in the face of ongoing conflict and death between their people. It's a somewhat simplistic Indie-type film, but the themes and questions posed are not so simplistic. Worth the time if for no other reason than to just gain some level of a new or broader perspective."
2,I would like a return / refund but I dont know how to get it !!!!,Dear whoever i purchased this game from:This is not the game I thought it was !! this game was overpriced and I found it for way cheaper plus it isn't even the one i wanted.Will you please instruct me how to get a refund or even an exchange??thank you soo much!!-braden
3,nice time killing game and funny,i liked the game coz its v simple and it made my littel bro and sis happy playin it
2,Boring!,"This book is soooo boring and reading it is tedious!! The drawings are nice and bright, but that's about the only good thing about it. The sandpaper is neat, and my daughter likes touching it, but generally sand at the beach feels soft, not like sandpaper. Let's stop trying so hard to make kids smart, and just have fun with reading."
3,Difficult installation,"On the plus side: this is the only front-mount receiver for Nissan Frontiers that I am aware of.The two tow loops mitigated my concern about removing my tow hook (you have to remove your tow hook(s) to install this receiver).Overall, I am very happy with this item.However ... installation was difficult. I've installed Curt rear-mount receivers on my Frontier and my wife's Rav4, and in both cases, installation literally took 5-10 minutes. This receiver, however, didn't fit. The holes in the hitch simply did not line up with the holes in my truck's frame. I am not sure if it was dropped in shipping (doubtful), or if it was just goofed up in fabrication; I had to stretch it a bit with a jack, and ultimately had to use a dremel to make the holes slightly larger on one side (which was fun, and expensive ... ate up better than a half dozen of those little grinding stones ... though admittedly, perhaps a dremel wasn't the right tool for the job)."
3,I'm glad I wasn't there,"The below review by another reviewer is exactly what I felt after listening to it, and give it the same stars.The only thing I can add, is most live albums either add a more energetic feel to the songs than compared to the confines of a studio, or in this period, the songs were stretched out a bit.Nothing of the kind""Not a good live album!, December 17, 2001By A CustomerThis review is from: You Had To Be There: Jimmy Buffett In Concert (Audio CD)Do not buy this if you want to hear music! But if you want to hear JB sermonize this is perfect. The songs are particularly short, and I think there is more of Jimmy talking than making music, But get this one if you want to hear drunk Jimmy giving a speech, which is what I'm not looking for, though it is also very entertaining""."
3,sizzla biggest fan,"Sizzla has recently shown signs of many changes,he has let his anger get the better of him.Sizzla alone can not change the world,but should continue trying to uplift the minds of the Black people,and do not use degrading terms referring to women.He can still be one of the best,but stick to being a conscious artiste."
2,"Sizzla, Whe Happen' to yuh Bwoy?",Sorry star but dis nuh mek it! Sorry fi si yuh tun to dancehall. Prefere yuh reggae tune dem. Why yuh sound so vex? Yuh scream so much mi caan overstand what yuh sayin'. Cool and relax boss.
2,Disappointing,"Lacks cohesiveness. Seems like a departure from many of the songs and themes that made him famous. At times he just seemed to be rambling with no clear message in mind. Overall, disappointing."
4,Brothers?,"Stevie was ""Don't miss a lick"", Jimmie is ""Don't waste a lick""! Two totally different styles. I love 'em both, but while in two entirely different moods. Both of Jimmies solo efforts are OUTSTANDING. Way too cool for radio play!"
2,"Great album, non-original packaging","Let me start off by saying that this is one of the most perfect blues albums ever made. As a matter of fact, I bought this to have a 'spare' of this work of art. However, this is merely a copy of the original album without the original artwork. Instead you get an 'official copy' with some tacky artwork without any liner notes. I had not seen that Amazon does mention this is 'manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media'; however, for $11.98 one would expect the real thing."
3,Neat licks and riffs but lacks the jucies,It's a good albumn with neat songs but to me the engineering doesn't sound all that great. Maybe with a little better sound setup this album would rock!
2,"""Nice"" but dull","""Tasteful,"" ""clean,"" and boring. I'm well aware that Jimmie is not his brother, and to be honest, I play Jimmie's cds as often as Stevie's, but this one is so dull, it just leaves me cold. Try ""Do You Get the Blues"" first for tasteful and clean in the good sense."
2,Can a CD be better than live?,"Unfortunately, yes. The CD is fair, but his performance last night with B.B. King's concert was really bad. Uninspired, simplistic guitar work, with no sign of emotion, enthusiasm or energy. As a very big fan of Stevie, this was a major disappointment."
5,Great for Joke Gifts,"They are great, highly recommend them for joke gifts / games / etc. I bought them for a Bachelor party and we handed them out to girls as we made fools of ourselves. It was ever so much fun. Functionality wise, never ""tested"". I'm sure they work just fine, but I wouldn't bet my future on it lol."
4,A good score to a terrific movie!,"Rosenman has delivered a powerful score to a wonderful movie! The opening theme is dazzling, The Whaler is a very suspenseful piece, and you can't resist the good jazzy feel of Market Street and Ballad of the Whale. This soundtrack isn't for everybody. After all, it's only 35 minutes long, which isn't long enough for some people to spend the money on. But, for any Star Trek music lover, this CD is a must have! One of the most underrated Star Trek soundtracks!"
4,Underrated,"It mystifies me why Star Trek fans dislike this soundtrack. The movie was a COMEDY, and the soundtrack reflects that. The best indication of this is the ""Hospital Escape"" track -- it's as funny without the imagery of the film as with it."
1,For Completists Only,"There are a few good pieces worth owning, but overall the soundtrack is just flat and unmemorable in every aspect. Many have argued that the music works for the film--and they may be right. But sadly, the music cannot stand alone, it falls apart quickly as uninspired and boring. I can't even sit through most of the album anymore, it just doesn't go anywhere or capture my imagination. As much as it pains me to say it about a Star Trek movie--this is one that may not have warranted a soundtrack release. It's filed in my collection for the sake of completion. I pulled this disc out earlier this evening, realizing I hadn't listened to it in ten years. It only took me two minutes to remember why that was, and it will be going back in the vault until I've forgotten why I don't listen to it again."
3,Missing Best Song!,"Okay, aside from the other comments and complaints made here, Im gonna go totally fan-boy and ask- Where's 'I Hate You' by Edge of Etiquette? You know, that song with the ridiculously amusing lyrics that the obnoxious punk guy on the bus is listening to? That's the best song in the movie, on more levels than one."
3,The Score is Not as Good as the Movie,"The first Star Trek soundtrack I bought was _Nemesis_, though it's one of the weakest movies.It's still one of the best - certainly the most distinctive - Trek scores.I'd call Star Trek IV the weakest score of all the films (and I now have them all) - but one of the best movies.Taken out of context (and even, a little, in context) the music here tries too hard to be comical and ends up sounding trite.But this is me being harsh, and mostly applies to only two tracks (Hospital Chase and Chekov's Run - nice pun there). The other two standouts are the Yellowjackets' pop pieces, 'Market Street' and 'Ballad of the Whale'. They feel a little out of place, but I neither love nor hate them.These four tracks are all appropriate to the movie, though, so it's hard to be mad at them.The other seven cues are good without being distinctive.I'm not sure I can recommend this CD, but you could do much worse."
2,Only for completists,"Probably the least interesting work of Leonard Rosenman. The main theme is nothing more than a variation of his Lord of the Rings-theme, and the other tracks don't really impress - with the possible exception of Time Travel. At 26 minutes (not counting in the poptracks) it's also very short - even for Rosenman standards.Still it's far from a bad soundtrack, but you would probably only buy it to complete your Star Trek-collection - or (in my case) your Rosenman-collection."
1,A dismal choice for scoring a Star Trek film,"Rosenman lacks the slightest trace of inspiration. Everything he writes sounds like his tepid scores for ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and this is no exception. This dull music actually detracts from the film...it would have been better off with no score at all."
4,Great manual for beginners at hand piecing and quilting.,"I had never hand pieced or hand quilted before I purchased this book. However, after reading the first few chapters, I took the plunge and started the ""Columbia"" design at the back of the book. The author said that this design is less difficult than it seems, and she was correct! It really was relatively easy and I found that hand sewing is much more precise than machine sewing. I've constructed mariners' compasses on the machine before but never one as accurate as the one that I hand pieced. Now I hand piece anything that requires precision, all because of of the confidence this book instilled in me."
5,Excellent resource!,"I quilt on my own--without benefit of classes or working with anyone else--much of the time. This book has helped me tremendously! Unlike most pattern books, the book tells the details of what it means to sew a certain type of stitch, suggests materials and tools, and even has quotes from older sewing and quilting reference books. Instructions for each process are available in as much detail as I have needed. Plus the pictures are beautiful and it's an added bonus to have patterns in the book, as well. I highly recommend this book."
5,Jinny gets better and better and better,"As usual, Jinny gives you much much more than your money's worth in this book. This book is beautifully laid out, full of information, and an absolute delight to read. Jinny continually gives the best of herself and her art in all of her books and this is no exception. Her work is timeless and always perfectly illustrated and clearly written. If you aren't yet a Jinny Beyer fan, this book will do the trick. A wonderful resource for both hand and machine quiltmakers. Don't miss it!! Thanks again, Jinny. Your contribution to quilting is unparalleled."
2,Lied to me,"Product was what I expected, however took forever to ship told me if I would take my review off they would give me 50% money back. Took the review off and never got the refund."
1,really poor quality,The product fits poorly and is extremely poorly made. The clip on tabs are tiny and will not last. I am going to retun this product. It is pretty much useless.
2,They are ok for a while,"These are all right. They came with my 26 piece chrome pro kit. I wish they were the slide on type, however these are the snap on kind. They have a plastic snap that snaps on the metal portion of the razor. After using one attachment for over a year mine warped and got loose. So the snap part comes off when you are cutting your hair. I usually have to hold it with my hand, but when it first happened the attachment fell off and I ended up shaving my head where I didn't want it shaved. Wahl should start using the slide on type attachments that majority of other manufacturers use."
3,hair clipper guide kit,The clipper guides are what I expected....simple plastic pieces to snap onto your Wahl hair clipper. Some of the guides dont clip on well and you need to hold them on yourself. This is a bit cumbersome but possible if you adjust the way you hold the clipper while trimming the hair. It would have been nice if they snapped on better and wouldn't fall off while trimming.
4,Good Product,Great quality guards so i will order them again from the same vendor with the Super Taper II Wahl machines.
3,Half and half,"I received two different guard sets mixed into a single package. Both bore Wahl logos, but only one of the two worked for my Wahl clippers. As my clippers may be 40 years or older (they belonged to my grandfather) I wasn't expecting to find anything that would fit them, but it seems that Wahl design hasn't changed much over the years. 3 stars for 5 usable guards that fit my very old, but well-working Wahl clippers."
2,Missing #3,"The product itself seems fine, but my set included two #4's and no #3 - which it turns out is the one I really wanted."
3,"First set broke, 2nd set is good...so far","The first set came and must have had a rough time in transit, because one of the pieces was broken. We got a replacement, and it's fine. The plastic is rigid, so it can be a little annoying trying to fit it onto the trimmer, but they are fine. Due to the rigidity of the plastic, though, I don't think they would be very durable. Too brittle."
3,"Check compatibility, especially with the Peanut.","I can not speak to the use of this product, only the documentation. I have bought this product for my Wahl Peanut shaver, and the heads are not compatible. There was not sufficient documentation from Wahl about what would work with my Peanut. I've learned actually nothing is compatible with the Peanut, at least that I know of. Because of the poor documentation and the desire to warn other buyers, 3 stars."
1,Crap album,"This album is nothing but a waste of money. Invest your money in thier olders cds, or if not at least K1 which is a awesome cd by the way. There is one new song on this cd, which is remixed a million times, along with the other ones. How many times can you remix a song? I mean come on, what are they wanting to be the chicano Diddy's. This cd is terrible, just download that one song if u like it, that sabes one. The rest of the album is really not worth it. If they are going to continue comming out with crap like this, they should just retire."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK. THIS IS CRAP!,"This album is so horrible. I stopped listening after the 4th song. If that does not tell you how bad it is, then I don't know what will. The Kumbia Kings can just stop now, because they have lost it! YUCK!"
1,Uh.... Isn't KK suppose to be Spanish???,"Although I have been a Kumbia Kings fan since the start of their career, I have to admit that this is by far ONE OF THE WORSE CDS that they have came out with. It seems like the english 'rap' is too catchy and to be honest, the sound of it isn't the same. With too many new members coming and going... the music of KK will never be the same!!!!"
4,tin man,"I bought this watch because it looked nice for super cheep. I love it, it is quite the conversation starter. I thought the big tic guy was an animation, but no, its just some thing fixed into the glass. people are always like, hey nice watch, then they look closer and they are like, whats that? is that the guy from futurama, or the tin man? I'm like uh I dont know. anyway, I've had it over a year now, still looks great, works well, and gets lots of comments."
4,It's a look inside,"You really get a feel for the way he thinks, and his eccentricities from this book. If you want to know what it would feel like to talk to him then read this book. If you want an in depth biography I recommend Tesla: Man Out of Time"
3,Understand this genius,"I liked this book because I knew little of Tesla. I understand him much better now. This book does not get into explanations of his actual inventions, but rather he talks about himself during his life. I did not realize that he was such a strange man and this book clearly shows that strangeness within genius."
3,difficult to understand,This is written by Nikola Tesla himself and is difficult to understand if you are not an engineer or an electrician.
5,The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla,i love it and the biographer. Too bad he has been barried by the greedy bastards who are only interested in ripping people off.
4,"Well written, but full of typos","This is a well-written book and a good insight into Nikola Tesla's life. However, I was a bit upset to find that this edition is full of typos. Misspellings, capitalization errors, those are just some of the problems I encountered with this book. They could have paid a bit more attention with the typography, honestly. And it's not just one typing error--it's error after error after error. But if you don't mind typos, you'll probably enjoy this book, and it's a quick read."
2,Sloppy publishing,"Full of typological errors, some of which rendered sentences incomprehensible. The publisher is in desperate need of a competent copy editor. Very unprofessional."
3,Good quick life story,"I'm really a fan of Tesla and this book was a good view into him as a person. Although the exact same pages of this book can be found in the end portion of the book ""The Nikola Tesla Treasury"" and I highly suggest that book over this one."
3,Not what I expected,"Tesla was brilliant, and the stuff contained in this book is interesting stuff, but I'd pictured an actual book rather than something that's barely out of the pamphlet class."
3,Daze! Daze! Daze!,"I bought this album years ago and because this is disco-music, it's a fact that you'll get bored to it. But here is many songs that I've never get bored to. ""Superhero"" and ""Be My Lover"" are mega-strong hits and after years of listening, you can still listen to them. Other songs are quite hollow... ""Bomb, bomb, bomb, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh la la laa!"" I like more the new album of Daze - ""They Came to Rule"". If you have money for this, then buy this but this isn't worth for crying or life!"
5,Daze is better than toy-box and aqua!,"Even thoe daze gets compared to aqua and toy-box, daze is much more supieror than those 2 groups for several reasons. Aqua and toy box have those annoying high pitched singers which gets really annoying to listen to after 2 minutes therefore, aqua and toy box are more in the bubble gum section which everyone dislikes unless if you are 12 and listen to radio disney or just some really childish and over grown teen or adult. The voice of the lead singer of daze is so strong and powerfull that it puts daze in the major leages meaning its not bubble gum as aqua or toy box.Daze is true eurodance. Also the songs of daze are much better in wording. Furthermore, i woudnt recommend playing aqua or tox-box while your driving in your car unless u want everyone to find you extremley annoying."
3,Would have been better if more original!,This is a fairly good CD but I wouldn't pay full price because some of their songs sound awfully close to other dance music from the past. And others just sound weak. They could learn a few things from Vitamic C or Dream.
4,Daze is exactly why I want to move to Scandinavia,"Euro-dance group, Daze, produced one of the best dance albums ever with ""Super Heroes"". This 1998 release is a perfect example of why I buy anything and everything that is dance and from Scandinavia. The music coming out of Sweden and Denmark is just awesome! This Danish group has hit after hit on this album. My favorites are definitely SUPERHERO(#1), TOGETHER FOREVER(THE CYBER PET SONG)(#3), BE MY LOVER(#4), TIC TOC(#7) and SEA OF LOVE(#8). The sound of this group is best compared to other Northen European groups such as Hit 'N Hide, Aqua and Toy Box. The vocals on this album, though, may be just a tad more mature. Filled with undeniably catchy lyrics and hooks, this is definitely one of the most substantial Euro-dance products on the market. This is highly recommended for those of you in the dance/pop scene."
2,Good idea gone inane,"The title is the best part of this book. The stuff inside isn't as funny as you might hope. May be good for a snicker, but you're not likely to guffaw."
3,It was OK,Plot was a little iffy in spots. Not up to Tarzan or John Carter. Did not have a real good grasp of 13th Century Armor or fighting.
4,experimental music that's actually melodic!,"Ben Johnston proves that being less conventional and being more aproachable aren't mutually exclusive with his microtonal suite for piano. His tuning allows him to do cool pseudo chromatic runs inwhich each step becomes slightly smaller than the last one (when ascending). The pure fifths sound really great in ""Blues,"" which goes into a cool 13/8 ostinato. The ""Song"" is really beautiful, too. Not being a fan of post Webern serrialism, I wasn't as pleased with the ""Sonata for Microtonal Piano,"" but I still found it more interesting than equal tempered serrialism."
3,Misleading description,"Usually, i am fan of Sanyo products. This one has a misleading description. This is not a typical mill & brew, you mill & you have to transfer to brew. Then, why not have separate mill & brewing machines. what is the use of this one ?Thanks to Amazon.com return policy"
2,Poor Longevity,"Well, I am writing this approximately 3 months after I purchased this product and I liked the design and function. Unfortunately, it just stopped working yesterday and of course that makes me question the longevity of this product. Perhaps you do get what you pay for in the end. Sanyo is not known for making Coffee Makers and perhaps that was a red flag !Disappointing."
4,it dose the job,"its gives you about 3 good cups.if you are buying it for the great taste of fresh ground flavor, then just buy better cofee to put in your regular maker.for the money its all there and you can use regular filters."
3,Great little machine... too bad it's discontinued.,"I've been using this little machine for the past two months, and I have to say I love it. The grinder works well, and the filter efficiently gets rid of the nasty aftertaste in my local tapwater, making for a delcious pot of coffee or tea.However, the water percolating up from the tank has started overflowing the filter recently. I've tried re-seating the filter, but it doesn't seem to help. Water still seeps around the upper edges of where it attaches to the main body of the unit... like it can't drip through the filter fast enough. Okay, I thought, I'll get a new filter. Amazon doesn't have any, so I go to the us.Sanyo.com website. They're out of stock, and the coffee maker has been removed from their store as well.I love the machine, but it looks like I got it just before they gave up on it. A pity."
5,Really Love it!,We just love our new coffee maker. Having the grinder and coffee maker as one unit is a delight. It brews a great cup of coffee and the size is just perfect for my husband and myself. It's worth every penney and then some.LeiLani
2,Buy the Melitta Mill 'N Brew Instead!,"Melitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, BlackWe bought the Sanyo Coffee/Tea Maker with Built-in Grinder after our Melitta Mill & Brew finally broke. We had purchased it at a Target store and when we went to replace it, they no longer carried it. So we looked at all the options on Amazon and thought the Sanyo sounded like a better coffee maker. WRONG! It is messy, complicated and has too many parts. We went back to the Melitta Mill & Brew and we won't switch again! It is very affordable and you don't have to transfer the ground beans to make the coffee. You just put the beans in, push the button and it grinds and brews the coffee automatically. Do yourself a big favor and skip the Sanyo and go straight to the Melitta...I promise you won't regret it!"
2,Has a fatal flaw....,"I really wanted this coffee maker to work, since I like the design so much.Pros:-Grinder works well-Smaller than it looks-Makes good tasting coffee-Low costCons:-Inconsistent, 2/3 of time it just steams all the water away and make very little coffee.I saw another review saying the coffee takes too long to make and I am having the same problem. When it works it makes 3 cups coffee out of 3.5 cup water in about 4 min (per manual). But usually it takes 8 min and makes only 1 cup of coffee out of 3.5 cups water. I think the problem is the heating element is too hot and all the water escapes as steam. Will be returning this one..."
2,Sanyo Coffee Maker,I am not pleased with this coffee maker - the water reservoir leaks so much that I cannot fill it the night before.
3,Worked fine-then stopped!,"I had a very fancy coffee maker that I had received as a wedding present that ground the beans and brewed automatically (Cuisinart) that I loved but did always seem clumsy/dirty and finally petered out after a year. After searching and searching on Amazon and reading reviews, I settled on this one. It's not very 'cool' looking, as others have pointed out, but that's not very big deal to me. Everything is compact and seems to be much cleaner because all of the parts are detachable and separate. After about a week of use, the coffee pot stopped working. I tried and tried, but it just would not brew a pot of coffee. It would make the noises, steam the water....nothing. I've sent it back to Amazon and went ahead and shelled out the extra money for a pod style coffee maker (B60). I guess you get what you pay for?"
1,Amazing Disappointment,"I drink tea absolutely everyday. My whole family and I. We drink all types of tea, red, green, white, black, herbal, etc. For quite some time I have been looking for a quality tea maker that will brew different teas correctly, quickly and with a minimum of mess. This machine is NOT it. The Sanyo is VERY cheaply made and has no input for tea type let alone tea steeping times. The grinder is very small and poor quality as well. The parts do not even fit together very well. Pick the pot up to pour your brew and the top will fall right off into your cup if you are not careful. There is no stop mechanism for the basket so if you remove the pot before every last of drop of water has sprinkled down be prepared for a hot mess.I am Costa Rican and long before my love of tea developed I was a hardcore coffee drinker and I can tell you that during my coffee only days I wouldn't have touched this machine with a ten foot pole."
1,The worst coffe maker,"This is the worst coffee maker I ever bought. I had Braun and Black and Decker before so I tried this because it has a built in coffee grinder.But when I used it, it sucks, I almost throw it away, unfortunately because I already disposed the box before I tested it and I can't return it anymore, I had to open it inside and removed the check valve to make it work, other wise the water turn into steam before it reach the coffee.To make story short, I'm doing everybody a favor by letting you all this,save yourself an aggrevation and money.Don't buy this one!!Good luck!"
3,too small,I can't find a coffeepot that meets my needs.This grinds well but needed to be larger for me.
3,a bit disappointing,"I am an experienced SE Asia traveler and took a chance on this to find its 100 some odd pages to be nothing more than a picturesque but thin overview with minimal information on lodgings or transportation choices. Maps are the strong point for this package, but for serious info. on travel logistics stick with the updated Lonely Planet (still inadequate) or the hefty tome by Jens Peters. And always be prepared for price fluctuations above or beyond what is quoted in any book. Unfortunately, the Philippines is one place that has no one single comprehensive and utterly reliable travel guide.I gave this an extra star just for being succinct which can sometimes be helpful when choices are overwhelming. Happy travels."
4,More Like these,"There needs to be more books like these out there. I have gotten other travel books before, and none had half the detail this one has in it. over all great book."
2,Philippines Travel Pack,"Overall the book lacks depth and historical perspective, particularly in the areas off the beaten path such as Mindanao and the Sulu chain."
2,Not a good book,"The story line is just so-so. And I feel that the story is being rushed through as the relationship between Jessica and Damien cannot be developed so fast. Tell me whether can you fall in love with a guy after a few months and get married straight away? NO! Be realistic.. In the second story, the author is not doing a good job, how can a woman be so straightforward by asking whether a guy like her or not and KEPT ON insisting the guy like her. NO woman will do that! But I give it 2 because the techniques used in writting are interesting and romantic. BUT THE EDITOR HAVE TO IMPROVE HIS GRAMMER!! I can easily spot spelling mistakes. I don't really recommand you to buy it, but rent it instead. I don't think I eer want to read another book written by her, maybe because I have read several other better authors."
2,Not a fanstastic book!,"I don't find this book marvelous or see why it deserved 5 stars. In fact, the whole plot is being rushed through. No elaboration is needed more. Between Jessica and Damien, they only met for a few months then get married. BE REALISTIC DEBBIE! How can you get married with someone you met for a few months. In the second story, Debbie gave me a VERY bad impression of her character, Mary Jo, as this Mary Jo kept insisting that the whatever the guy is called, likes her. And do most girls do that? NO! Also, it gives me a bad impression of Jessica trying to act cute in front of guys. I recommend you not to buy it but rent it. I am very disappointed with Debbie's style of writting. The book also have lots of grammer and spelling errors."
3,Can be finiky,"I was so happy just to have this tool. Made my life much easier with multiple USB hard drives in use.It's cute, stylish, and compact which i love.My only complaint is that a few of the ports tended to be finiky and I'd have to switch... I never figured it out and they never stopped working completely."
5,Tallis Scholars are great!,Superb singing! with a masterful chorus and conductor. I have spent time singing with Peter Philips' seminars and love his knowledge and style.
4,A charming family chronicle,"Aciman's memoir of his multiethnic, multiglossic family in Alexandria starts out a bit confusingly: he purposefully (and perversely) hides just how certain characters are related to one another, and to himself, in the opening sections, which makes things a bit confusing. But once he enters as a character himself in the book, things straighten out and the reader can immerse himself or herself in the sights and sounds of mid-century Alexandria. The characters (mostly his family members and servants) are charmingly original, and really come to live. Oddly, though it takes his introduction into the narrative for the memoir to straighten itself out, Aciman's own character is kept occulted in this memoir, and most of what we see him do is misbehave. Aciman clearly and wisely learned from Proust (his admitted model) never to sentimentalize himself--a mistake other memoirists often commit."
1,Don't buy this book - not worth $30,"I bought both this book and Mattie Sue Athan's book. Athan's book is a good value and has more info than this one. Pamela's book talks more about the ""family"" of the Senegal parrot than the actual Senegal. She also uses the same photo over and over again. If this book was $8 it would be okay, but not $30. ""Guide to the Senegal Parrot"" is a much better book and a better value."
2,Redundent,Much of her writing is extremely basic and is not strickly limited to the Senegan> Tend to give habits of cocatiels although the bird is not mentioned.There are bett books aout there.Buyer beware!!!
1,Skip this one,"This book has lots of scholarship & award information but it wasn't useful. It did not give enough information. I needed to consult other sources. Also, the book was faster to use than the CD. Skip this one, I didn't find it helpful at all."
2,kinda weird,Bought this shirt because of the color but I was disappointed. This shirt is rubbery feeling inside. It's a very strange textile for a shirt. It's bound to make you feel sweaty almost instantly. Not sure what they were shooting for here.
5,"It's soul, not just chanting.","The words in this CD give it a peacefulness, but it's the beautiful singing that makes it great listening. This is soul music."
3,These Guys Are Just Too Perfect!,"I was immediately drawn into the first few stories because they made me feel like I was reading my own. A few stories further, the novelty began to wear off, and they did indeed become monotonous. I think that would be almost unavoidable, considering the basic plot line, but my chief complaint was the lack of diversity among the authors. It seemed as though every one of them was a prime candidate for ""Who's Who in American Colleges & Universities."" Frankly, they were all a little too perfect, and by the end, I found it downright boring! How about some stories from your average (or even below-average) JOE?"
2,The same story over and over,"The most disappointing aspect about this book is not the content, which is interesting, but the repetativeness of the stories. There is very little diversity in either orientation (bi vs. gay) or ethnicity--but even more grating is the lack of diversity of experience. Each story sounds surprisingly more and more like the others, and by the end I couldn't remember if I had read a particular story or not. The book's first story is promising and well written; but the remainder come off as resumes with no in-depth emotional punch. I had hopes that some stories would delve into the impact of balancing same-sex attraction in an environment of brotherhood but none of the authors dig deep enough, and the editors certainly couldn't find enough diversity of experience to make the book very interesting."
1,Brotherhood?,"Anyone who enters into a fraterntity while keeping their sexual identity a secret does not understand the concept of brotherhood very well. I have no doubt that there is intense homophobia in fraternities, but brotherhood is a two way street. On cannot expect to keep major secrets from their ""brothers"" and then be surprised when they are ostracised when they are discovered to havet been leading a double life."
4,Two year-old fascination,"I had purchased this set for myself and it has become an all-out fascination with our 2 year-old, now 3. This set, though requiring hands-on assistance because of the difficulty getting the glue to squirt out, has really turned her on to creating her own ""art work."" I would agree with the previous review, though, it does require older hands to squeeze the tubes and clogging of the applicator tips is an issue. I have found that crayola glitter pens work better for little people but I like this for my more grown-up craft projects."
3,Annoying for parents of younger children,"The package says 3+. My toddlers recently turned 3 and had difficulty removing the caps and squeezing the pens. I had to help them every time they wanted to use a new pen. It was very frustrating for them. I had to use a paper clip to unclog the tips of some of the pens. The plastic packaging is very sharp on the edges and does not appear to be recyclable. And the MOST annoying part: different types of caps for each type of pen, and some of them just would not fit onto the pens again. I suggest a glass of wine before you start trying to put the pens back together. I regretted this purchase. I gave this 3 stars because an older child might appreciate these, but I still would recommend that an adult open the plastic packaging."
2,They went from whining about Bush nonstop to whining about Christians nonstop.,"Really, guys, I know you can do better than this. No, I don't support Bush, the war, or anything that has to do with our current government and I am not a biblebeating Christian, but I know that Fat Mike has better writing skills than he shows on this CD and 'The War On Errorism', which also sucked. The only good song on here is 'You're Wrong', which shows Fat Mike's true writing ability. The rest of the songs are boring, and yes, whiney. Get the new Anti-Flag album, or the new A Global Threat CD. Those are worth the money. This is worth nothing. I won't be buying the next full-length. =/Instead of getting this EP, I would suggest checking out the following NOFX CDs:RibbedSo Long And Thanks For All The ShoesHeavy Petting ZooWhite Trash, Two Heebs And A BeanPunk In Drublic"
1,"LEARN HOW TO SPELL, KIDS!","NOFX is probably the most shamelessly sold out punk band EVER. Fat Mike thinks his opinion is law, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it. What happened to the good ol' days, when they were ACTUALLY FUNNY? I mean, is this record a joke!?!?? Yeah, and um, NOFX isn't the funniest band ever. In fact, this WON'T give them a song idea. NOFX has no ideas. They are just jumping on the political and religious bandwagon to sell more records. Honestly, I don't care what NOFX says anymore. All I hear is a bunch of whiners going ""Blah, blah, blah...""Oh, P.S. If you want a REAL funny song by a punk band that actually has their own ideas, check out GREEN DAY's ""Dominated Love Slave"" off of Kerplunk!"
2,NOFX Never Trust a Hippie,"Musically this record rocked! But i have to say the substance is what killed it for me. Although i cant say i was surprised because i heard most of these songs from the 7"" Club. the best song on this EP was ""everything in moderation(especially moderation)"" and ""the Marxist Brothers"". If u love NOFX as much as i do but love Jesus more. Dont buy this record."
1,"Sorry, kids...","Listening to this does not make you punk. I know, you're devastated, all you five star reviewers, but you're posers, so you'll go listen to fall out boy and get over it.If you want REAL punk, try the RAMONES or SEX PISTOLS(hmmmm. previous reviewers have not mentioned these bands. If you don't own EVERY single one of their CDs, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO CALL YOURSELF A PUNK!!!)NOFX was awesome... Now they're sellouts.."
3,"Not the best, but a nice teaser","Although the six songs on here are far from NOFX's best work, they are still a nice teaser for what is to come in Wolves in Wolves Clothing, which will probably turn out to be a mediocre album if the songs are on par with these.The songs are not amazing, but they don't suck either. I'd only pick up this EP if you're already a NOFX fan. If not, get some of their older stuff first and then buy their full length album when it comes out if you're still interested.This is not NOFX at their best, but I must say even NOFX at their worst is pretty damn good."
3,Fat Mike should get over himself,"I think it's funny when people act as if NOFX, with albums like this one, is doing something, new, important, or intelligent. I'm sorry kids, mindlessly taking an anti mainstream approach does not make you specialz. The saddest part is that these guys have got a great sound. My advice: let the pretentious political lectures slide and enjoy some catchy fun times punk rock. Too bad Fat Mike's got the politics of a high school punk who thinks he's enlightened after reading the works of Michael Moore. Republican or Democrat, I don't care. Just try to have an argument better than 'anything popular is bad because George Bush is stupid!' Why is it that all self-confessed non-conformists conform to liberal stereotypes? Way to think for yourself.Please don't mistake me for a troll. These guys have talent, and this is a fun sounding punk record. It is super catchy and I do recommend it. Just be prepared for many juvenile political rants disguised as lyrics. Such a waste."
5,don't listen to the dumbass that wrote the review below mine,"this is a great album, don't listen to this other guy that doesn't know what he's talking about, this album is every bit as good as white trash if not better. and i would know, been listening to nofx for a little over 12 years."
2,Not good with h4n,"I had intended to use this system in combination with the Zoom H4N, however when paired with the H4N it produced some really bad static interference, different positioning did not seem to help. Great return service from Amazon though. Amazon 5 Stars."
4,Good Value for the Price,"I purchased the microphone set to use for a video shoot. I'm glad I didn't go with a less expensive option.The microphone records quite ""hot"" so their is recording ""noise"" or a ""hiss"" when listening to playback, but since it records at such a high volume, in the editing software I use, I just turn down the volume.I plugged in the microphone into my DV Camera and my camera into my computer. I found that the video and the audio was slightly out of sync. That could be just the way my camera and the computer interacted, but with a quick fix in the video editing software I was using, it was no problem.I like the small size of the microphone and clip. The other microphones I looked at were way too big. The accompanying wind-guard is a nice addition."
3,Solid Construction,After reading the reviews I bought the wirless set. They are very solid and not cheap when holding them. The clip for the reciver connects to the cameras hotshoe. I have yet to test the wireless system in the field. The included microphone seems to work well. The microphone is very sensitive and will pick up everything around it.Only negative thing is that it only has two channels. For the price you can not go wrong with the wirelss transmiter / reciver combo.
2,Low price for a reason,"I have not been happy with this purchase. Unless your subject is very close, you'll get static. (Although, if you are very close and there is no static, the quality is just fine) I wish I would have waited, saved and bought a more pro (probably UHF) system.The first sign that things weren't going to work out well, was when I opened the package and notice ""Mike In"" and ""Mike Out"". Of course, we should all know that the shorthand for Microphone is ""Mic"". Obviously the Taiwanese children who assembled this didn't know that.I would advise you to not buy this. The price IS too good to be true."
2,Ok...depending on your use,"I got these wireless lavaliers with the hope of recording audio through a usb preamp; what I got was unusable low-level signals covered in hideous static. While I'm sure that these mics work fine direct to camcorder, this is not my purpose for purchasing these items.To the buyer, I say 'beware'."
2,Not a great pairing with Zoom H4N,"Do not get this lav system if you're planning on recording to a Zoom H4N, or probably any device like it. I used this lav fairly successfully with my Canon HFS100 camcorder; I would have the occasional click and pop and the sound was pretty muddy, but otherwise it wasn't horrible. I've since stepped up to a Canon 7D and now like to record my audio separately to a Zoom H4N. This lav just isn't shielded properly and gets a ton of interference when used with the H4N. It sounds like being on cordless phone a little out of range. For the price, I unfortunately don't think there's any better option. This just isn't an option for me anymore. I now have to rent an $800 lav system when I shoot"
2,"Snap, Crackle, Pop","Not thrilled w noise. It's not constant, but every couple mins there's highly audible noise, and this is very susceptible to interference from computer, other electronics.I also bought this one:Azden WMS-PRO Wireless Microphone System-- WISH I bought a seconds Azden instead of this Audio Technica. :( Unfortunately I bought the AT from a 3rd party (not amazon) so I can't return it.... Sigh."
4,Best wireless for the money,"I was looking for a wireless mic without spending a ton of money. This was the one, good sound at short distance"
2,risky,"I was hoping to avoid the big price tag of a UHF system and got the 88W instead. I wish I hadn't. The initial tests were promising, until I walked further from the reciever, and had some small obsticles between the two units. I began to pickup static that switching between the two channels didn't change. A day or so later, I used it in the field and had the same static problem even when I was well within the suggested range. And again, changing frequencies didn't help at all. Perhaps this is the nature of an FM system vs. a UHF system. And while I saved hundreds of dollars in going with the 88W, I'm afraid to use it most of the time, making this a hundred bucks wasted instead of four hundred saved. Of course it doesn't always do this. And when it works, it is great. It's larger size, compared to the top of the line UHF models, is'nt anything I couldn't live with. But its range and susceptability to interference is a big drawback."
1,Only Work for Four Months,"We purchased two of these exact microphones and both conked out after four months, no reason. When the first one stopped working after four months, the power light was on but we changed batteries just in case, etc. and nothing worked. We thought we must have broken it somehow and bought the exact one again. After four months, the same problem occurred, no reason again. These microphones are not reliable at all."
4,Works Great,You have to figure out the little tweaks but after you do they work great. They do exactly what was described. Easy to work with.
2,Too much interference. Nothing but static.,"I read all the reviews before I bought and decided to try my luck. Even with short distance 3 feet, I got tons of noise. Not useful to record to a camcorder ,"
2,A terrible wireless device.,"This dual channel wireless device is contently picking up static and interference. This device even in a open field picks up the most intense interference even with 50 ft. This device is also not very well shielded from other electrically devices, this lavalier system picks up the interference from the pulsing in-use light on my dslr during filming. In my opinion this is a terrible system especially if your sub is moving there arms a lot."
3,Audio Technica Pro88w wireless Lavalier Mic,I bought this mic for use with the Kodak Zi8 The audio comes out low so you will need a mono to stereo jack you can get from radio shack for three bucks but if you put the mic into a mixer and record audio to disk the sound is very good.
1,Avoid and spend a few extra bucks on something else.,"If you are 2 feet away from your subject and there are no obstacles such as air between both of you, then this might be the mic for you. Lots of static and absolutely unreliable. If you are a serious video pro, avoid this system."
2,Not a Good Microphone,"This microphone emits constant static no matter how it is configured. I used it for an outdoor wedding, with no wind and away from powerlines, and the audio constantly clipped out or peaked when no one was speaking. I suppose it is a decent mic if you are planning on shooting entirely indoors, with no movement whatsoever."
2,No HEADPHONE JACK/ Manual Audio Level Control,"Aside from the hoopla over its dock, 16 x 9 ""WS"" mode and so-called ""24p"" scan effect, Sony made the biggest blunder imaginable -- it eliminated the headphone jack with this camcorder and with it, a huge chunk of the prosumer/high end consumer camcorder user audience.Basically, there's no way to gage even basic audio levels with this camera. if you're recording an interview, how do you know the audio isn't peaking? If you want to test playback audio, how can you without hooking this thing up to a TV?Sony's R&D; were flat out stoned the day they overlooked this feature; either that, or completely and utterly naive. They should look at the closest matchbox competitor -- the Canon Optura's -- and learn a thing or two about headphone jacks and audio levels...."
1,Pleased with the transaction in general,"Unfortunately, the software did not work, but I communicated with the seller and she was always very prompt and positive in her responses. Seller gave me a full refund plus the cost of the shipping back! That's commitment! I would definitely buy from her again."
1,Defective CD and Expensive,First the price is too high for an AAD CD with about 12 tracks. I bought two at $30 each. One is a gift. The first time we played it one song skipped so bad we turned it off.
5,Fair Album with 1 starlight and 0 aspects,"I think this album is F-A-I-R because it has one starlight express song and zero aspects of love songs. This is why i liked the album The reason i said that this is a fair album is that I like Starlight Express better. Song i like are ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Take That Look off Your Face"", All I Ask of You"", ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"", ""Mr. Mistofflees,"" ""Superstar,"" ""Memory"", ""Starlight Express"", ""Tell Me On A Sunday"", ""Music of the Night"", ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"", and ""I Don't Know How To Love Him"". I dislike the following songs:"" Track 6"" and the last one because the last one was hard to understand and track 6 is instrumental."
5,Excellent! A must buy!,"This CD is wonderful for the Broadway buff or the casual listener who wants something different to listen to in the car. As it has been said before, this is the CD to get if you're looking for one Andrew Lloyd Webber compilation CDs - don't be fooled by the cheaper counterparts - or you'll see exactly WHY they earned that price tag. This CD has the original recordings, but the only drawback of this CD is that it is rather out of date (1987) and you miss out on some great material from his later works (""Aspects of Love"", ""Sunset Boulevard""). There is a follow-up CD to this one aptly called ""The Premiere Collection Encore"" which picks up where this one left off; I recommend that as well."
4,Musical Pleasure,"I enjoy all of this music, listening frequently. Some not original cast members, so less than 5 star. Product exactly as advertised."
5,ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER PRMIER COLLECTION,THIS CD IS OUTSTANDING! HAD IT ON CASSETTE YEARS AGO AND NEEDED TO REPLACE THAT. ALL SHOWSTOPPERS!BUY THIS CD!!
4,Provides good strategic insight,"The book provides an interesting perspective into the many dimensions of strategy. It gives an introduction, a historical example, and discussion of each section. It is up to the flexibility and insight of the reader to make full use of the information provided."
5,Walks the edge between popular and learnt,"In my opinion, this is the best Geographical magazine around. The images are as good as they come, the articles are amazing. The style is popular enough so that everyone can read them, and they have enough information so that everyone will learn something from them. Every issue has some biographical articles, some on recent expeditions, some on nature, some historical, and plenty of book reviews. In short, this magazine gives you a little bit of everything. What I really like about it is that it does not shy away from contorversial or serious issues. Here we can read about unkown genocides, natural disasters, or climate change. Geographical does dare to take sides in political issues. It is not for someone that is only out for a leisurely read. It is for us who want a leisurly way to keep informed!"
4,A CD That Outlasted The T.V. Series,"Seeing Miami Vice in re-runs really made me wonder what I saw in the T.V. show in the first place. The music from the T.V. show is a different story. I originally bought this sound track for Andy Taylor's ""When The Rain Comes Down"". After hearing the entire CD I was quite surprised that it transcended my expectations. A nice merge of divergent music styles."
3,"Great collection of tunes from the show, but...........","It's missing ""Voices"" by Russ Ballard and ""Ship of Fools"" by Robert Plant. The first album disappointed me by not including ""Girls with Guns"" by Tommy Shaw and ""I've Got a New Girl Now"" by Honeymoon Suite."
3,Fair,"Following the massive success of the first Miami Vice soundtrack, this album feature some new songs that are fair but have nothing memorable about them. It also was not liked by the audience that much either b/c it only charted at 82 on the billboard 200, unlike the original which was number 1 for 11 weeks. If youre a die hard Miami Vice fan, I recommend it, but if youre not just skip over this and buy Miami Vice The Complete Collection."
4,Great flashback,"These songs really took me back, good rendition of Crockett's theme, and a forgotten song by former Sex Pistol Steve Jones."
2,not eight cylinder,"This is not for an 8 cylinder as ad said, I bought this for my v8 and when I recived it the instructions,and box say it it fits a 4 cylinder."
2,repetitive and boring,"I had expected more from this Peruvian social satirist. His writing while amusing at the beginning, gets tedious from his repetitious use of "" puchas"" and other aphorisms. After reading the first few tales you want to close the book and find one that is better written. His social criticism may be on target but his writing is far from it."
1,"SORRY, WRONG NUMBER!","Ringing? More like clunking. Way back in '56, Comden and Green sat down and wrote a musical for their chum Judy Holliday. With Jule Stein's help, this trio concocted the classic Bells Are Ringing---a musical marvel about a telephone answering service in New York City. The original recording---recently reissued with bonus tracks by Sony Legacy---is also a classic, and belongs in every show music library. This recording of the recently deceased Broadway revival does not. The music and lyrics are still wonderful and moving and funny, but star Faith Prince is cloying and charmless. Sorry, wrong number."
3,Good only if you saw the show.,"I loved the revival of the musical. It's classic! It's so funny and charming and unpretentious. But unfortuneately this album displays the musical as dull and lifeless. Faith Prince comes off as overplayed and ""kitschy"" and Mark Kudisch comes off as bored. When I saw the show neither seemed that way at all. The song ""I'm Going Back"" brought the house down on Broadway, but I often skip that track when I listen to the cd, I'm sorry to say. Luckily, the big hit from the show ""The Party's Over"" is still as beautiful as the first time it was written-- and Thank God. It's a good play... a good cast... and has good music! It just comes off as very poor and dull..."
5,Sadly Overlooked,"I had the privilege of seeing 'Bells Are Ringing' twice before it quickly closed, and I found it to be a delightful show, with an equally wonderful cast recording. Faith Prince is a wonderful Ella, and those who couldn't see past Judy Holliday missed out, unable to see the beauty of her renditions of the classics ""The Party's Over"" and ""I'm Going Back"", as well as her delightful ""Is That A Crime"" and ""It's A Perfect Relationship"". Marc Kudisch is in his best form as Jeffery Moss. His rendition of ""I Met A Girl"" is wonderful, and he & Prince give a terrific ""Just In Time"".It really is a shame that the theater community couldn't embrace this charming show, as the performers were wonderful. You now can enjoy it with this cast recording- and I guarantee that you will."
5,Incredible soundtrack,"I had no idea this was so hard to find....does anybody know the real name of that ""Apron Strings"" song that plays during the time she is pregnant, or better yet, the artist who sings it?"
2,I waited 10 years for this CD and I am less than impressed,"There is really just one great song on it, This womens work. The others aren't that great. I was really surpriced because I loved the movie. I think that after all the build up of trying to get it, and then finally getting it, I think I expected more. So unless you know all the songs on the CD and you like them, I wouldn't bother."
4,missing songs,i own this soundtrack on cassette and there are about 4 more songs on it than what is listed as being on the c.d. 'apron strings' is on the tape as well. why would they be on the tape and NOT on the c.d?!
5,Take it to the hospital to play during labor!,"I have a copy of a copy of this soundtrack and took it to the hospital to listen to during labor. Why oh why won't they rerelease this great soundtrack??? If someone finds a copy, CD, cassette or LP, I'd love to know!"
4,baby,"Actually, I bought this soundtrack for one song I was very interested in, but after listening to the songs. The whole soundtrack just grew on me. The songs reflect the movie and the whole message that it sends to the audience."
3,Please have this reissued.,with so many people wanting this soundtrack I am sure someone could make some money by having it reissued. Please help us.
4,"80s to the max, but still great","The film that this soundtrack represents (when it's actually in print) was a funny little gem, and from the Breakfast Club on, John Hughes always made sure that his soundtracks were very carefully assembled.In this case, some great alt-rock from Gene Loves Jezebel (""Desire""), a classic crooner by Bryan Ferry (""Crazy Love""), a Smiths cover by Kirsty MacColl (""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby""), and one of Kate Bush's best tracks (""This Woman's Work"") round out a phenomenal collection of essential 80s tracks."
2,Disappointed,"I have seen Michael Amante in concert and this CD is not the best of his voice. He has a very powerful voice and it did not come out in this CD. The music he picked to record was good, mostly Tom Jones type music, but his voice is not at it's best. I think it needed better back-up or accoustics to bring out the power of his voice."
1,Didn't work,"For whatever reason this did not work between my stereo and sirius player. They were great with the return, looking for a new one."
5,Fine,good product. not issues. abcd efg hij klmn op qr st uv wx yz ab cd ef gh ij klmThis is nuts to require 18 words??
4,Looks good to me,"The previous reviews shown here have nothing to do with this book. They appear to be for ""The Beatles Paperback Songbook"", which does look to be small and not necessarily accurate.""The Beatles 1 - Recorded Version Guitar"" appears to be exactly what it says: transriptions of the recorded versions. My guitar teacher has spent a couple of sessions breaking down ""Day Tripper"" off of the CD for me. What this professional musician came up with for this song is almost verbatim what is published in this book. So now I have it written out in a form that I can actually read (and correct as needed). It is a full-size (8.5x11) music book and I look forward to working my way through it."
4,Don't Let It Be,This book has mostly accurate guitar tabs except the lead solo in Let It Be which is very weak. Also Paperback Writer shows a tune down a whole step and play the song in A which will be in the correct key of G. Who wants to have to tune down to play this song ? I've seen a lot of Beatles footage and they play it in G not A. I expect to learn it as the Beatles played it. There are some descent tabs here though but not their best guitar songs. Over all i'm glad to have purchased it and will keep it.
2,Just Okay,This connection is just okay. I put on as tight as I could but it still leaks. Looking for something else.
1,FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT AYUB KHAN,"This book is totally a book that contains history guidelines and it fails to focus on Ayub Khan as a leader. It merely just contains opinions about Ayub Khan without any justification. For all the readers out there, do not buy this book. Don't waist your breath."
3,That slow song...,"I saw someone was looking for the slow song name from the movie. It's by David Gray and it's called ""This years love"". I love the song and I noticed this soundtrack doesn't have many of the songs on the movie. That stinks. =P"
4,Are they missing songs on the soundtrack?,"There is a great song that I noticed they played in the movie, but I don't think it's on the soundtrack?? It is a slow song, and was played during the ""love scene"". Can anyone help??"
5,Atypical review,"While I may not have actually purchased the CD yet per se, I'm determined that I'll love it (and yes, in the full sense of that word; I'm going to cherish an inanimate object) for one simple reason: it's got the track Shattered, by Remy Zero. I've been looking for this incredible song ever since I saw the movie Suicide Kings four years ago. This haunting melody alone is worth twice the number on any CD sticker. I'd drive to whatever no-name, po-dunk, ""Bob's Shack O' CDs""-style place I had to, just to get this. To find it here on Amazon, and me with a credit card in hand, well, some things just fall into your lap. Lucky me. It's an unbelievable shame that there isn't a sample of Shattered available here right now, because unless a song that cures cancer and simultaneously teaches me how to dance is on the album, Remy Zero has the best track hands down. I'm exaggerating, yeah, but you'd agree with me if you could just hear the song.Right now, I'm just glad I finally found it."
4,help for a music fan,"the song that ""a music fan"" may be yearning for is by david gray, called 'this year's love'. its an emotional yet hopeful love ballad, everyone should check it out"
4,How come nobody has mentioned one of the coolest songs?,"Okay. This soundtrack is pretty solid from top to bottom. I agree that the ""David Gray"" song is a song that should have been on the soundtrack as well.My biggest question for all you music afficionados is my search for the name of the song that was playing when Carlos uses the hall pass and Kirsten Dunst's character is singing a song while she's sitting under the tree. I could be way off on this, but the voice sounded somewhat like Bjorks. This song has a haunting beauty about it and it would make my day if someone could help me to finally answer this question."
4,HELP!! LYRICS NEEDED,"i love the song ""perfect"" by marin ord..but the lyrics are nowheres to be found! please send them if you have them..thank you"
4,I NEED HELP,"I love this movie, i watch it over and over. I'm hooked on a song i can't find the name to. It's right before the david gray song comes on and it's a female artist? Does anyone know what i'm talking about? if so please let me know i've been searching for this song for way to long!Thanx :)"
3,WHAT IS WITH THIS??,"Ive listened to the cd...and yes...it does its job of putting across the airy fairy love thing...but wheres the AMAZING ""Hed(pe) - Killing time"" on the soundtrack?? And I heard a couple of seemingly decent songs in the part of the movie where they first took out the guy and the girls were singing along to a couple of songs in the car...anybody have any idea what these were?"
4,3 Awesome SoNgs!!!,"This soundtrack was awesome, but there were 3 songs that stood out at me as awesome!!! that song, ""Perfect"", ""Shattered"", and, ""I Want to Believe You"".... they were great!! the movie was AWESOME!!!!! i definatley recomend it!"
3,Shattered,"Yup, buying it for the same reason. Just spent hours scouring the net trying to find anything on that song and it has led me here. God I love the internet.And the song is so good, I'm gonna pay overnight shipping just to hear it ASAP. It is worth the money alone."
2,There's a song missing,"I got admit this cd has some fresh beats.A few of the tracks get me grooving.I love number 7But besides all that there is 1 song that I absolutely fell in love with, so i'm really hoping you can help me find the artist of this one song.It's played when Carlos and Nicole first make love, it's actually really played when Carlos is leaving Nicoles house walking down her drive way and she is lying in her bed as she realizes she has fallen in love.I have to find that song so if you know the song, or artist can you please give me the info. I would appreciate it.thanks,searching 4 a song"
2,Missing songs is a dissapointment.,"I agree with the other here. There is a love song missing & I'm unable to find it. Why would you sell a soundtrack and not include ALL the songs (good ones) on the CD? There are a few decent songs on the soundtrack, but nothing to brag about. If someone knows this ""mystery"" love song, please let us know!"
4,Answer for Sean in Los Angeles,"The long-form movie trailer used three songs, beginning with Filter's ""Take a Picture"" (which can be found on their album Title of Record) and then The Crystal Method's ""Keep Hope Alive"" (available, among other places, on their debut album Vegas). The song to which you're referring, though, is ""Bohemian Like You"" by The Dandy Warhols. It comes from their excellent 2000 album Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia, which also contains the beautiful song ""Sleep,"" which you'll find you already own on this soundtrack. Hope this helps."
4,Haven't Even Seen the Movie,"I haven't even seen the movie, but I noticed the music on the previews and so I came to amazon.com to check out the tracks. I downloaded them all and burnt them on a cd. I love this CD. Whoever said that the reason they picked this music is because it ""relates to teens"" is right. When I am in the car and hearing these songs I feel totally connected to the music and empowered by their impact. It's like when you hear a song you totally love and you think this song was written for you because it says everything you are feeling. And to the girl wondering about the song, if you would LISTEN TO THE CD you would find out that the song is number ten: Sumpin' by The Pimps. Definitly buy this cd."
3,"Right there with ya, TX fan","Hmmmmmm...since I last saw Suicide Kings, I have been debating the same thing -- to buy this CD or not to buy this CD? Will ""Shattered"" be as special and amazing song once I actually own it? Wish I could listen to a sample here..."
4,where the trailer music?,"i bought this CD thinking it had the movie trailer's music in it, well, it doesn't!im looking for the song that plays in the second part of the trailer. anyone know the name?thanks"
4,Good Book for a Great Cause,"I am not sure what caused me to pick up this book, as I am not usually a mystery reader. I liked the idea of all of the stories having the three elements of a thick book, a thick steak, and a thick fog. It was interesting to see how each author wove them into their story.I enjoyed almost all of the stories. The one that I wasn't able to finish was the one written by Walter Moseley.It was a good way to catch a glimpse of the writing styles of authors I have never read before. I applaud each of them for contributing to a very worthy cause."
4,Really Great Stories,"I have a habit of buying anthologies for just one story - usually its a series by a favorite author and I must read that story!With The Plot Thickens this was exactly the case. I wanted to read The Last Peep by Janet Evanovich, which is set amongst the Stephanie Plum books. The Last Peep follows Stephanie and Lula as they track down Sam the Squirrel, after he was arrested for indecent exposure. What follows is an exhilarating time, that involves not just our favourite but bounty hunts, but also our favorite Grandma, Grandma Mazur, as she helps them out and brings the weaponry.This is definitely a story for all the Stephanie Plum fans. The only unfortunate side to this one is no Morelli nor Ranger - seemed a little weird without our favourite guys, but there is plenty more Morelli and Ranger in the upcoming Finger Lickin' Fifteen, due out in June.With more than just this one story, I will be sure to check out more of the stories in this great anthology soon."
3,The plot thickens,"Was a one chapter book so really can't do much review, the author didn't have much time to get into things but still good reading."
3,The Plot Thickens,Interesting anthology. All the short stories were interestig some moreso than others. I purchased the book because my favorite author Janet Evnovich wasamong those selected to parfticipate.Fay Slater
3,***,not as good as I thought it was gonna be. it still wasn't too bad. I love Mary Higgins Clark and her short story was great but I didn't like the other writers. They are nowhere as talented as her.
3,Pretty good,This is a bunch of short stories some are better than others. But for the most part a pretty good book.
2,Less than expected,Bought it for my wife. She said that it wasn't worth the money. It was enjoyable but nothing to write home about. Would've bought from used bookstore.
2,Disappointing,"Although I read most of these authors, this was a disappointing book. The only good thing about it is that the purchase goes for a worthy cause."
3,Tha Plot Thickens,"Some of the stories were better than others. I skipped at least two of the authors, as the story line did not grab me within the first page."
3,"As Good As A ""Thick Fog""","I have to agree with most of what was written by others. If it were not that this book was written for charitable purposes ... I probably wouldn't have given it 3 stars. I was hard press to find three stories that were worth reading from beginning to end.I did enjoy looking for the ""thick"" book, steak and fog in each story. In most of the stories it seemed that the authors stuck in the 3 elements listed as an after thought. The stories I enjoyed most were stories where there was some thought put into the plot.Because this book was written for charity, I would encourage others to purchase it, read and review it."
2,The Plot weakens,I was disappointed. I gave it 2 stars cuz there were only two stories worth reading. Walter Mosely and Ann Rule.
1,Worst Game Ever,"This game is awful. Terrible graphics, Boring gameplay and 4 catch phrases per scene that are repeated over and over until your ears bleed."
3,Not worth the cost,"This game may be some what entertaining, but Brian's parts are really hard to get past unless you look them up on the internet. I beat this game in five days, and you don't get anything special once you beat it. You would be better off renting this game than paying $30 for something you will only play for a week."
1,Rated 'I' for Impossible,"The game is very, very hard on the Brian levels. They are very frustrating to play and not much fun. Otherwise, the other levels are pretty easy. You will have to play mini-games that are strange. If you succeed on Stewie's mini-games, you will get 10 bullets for his gun which helps sometimes. If you succeed on Brian's mini-games, you will turn invincible for a few seconds, which doesn't really help. If you succeed on Peter's mini-games, you will give Peter more food. Rent rather than buy this game.Please do not copy this review for use elsewhere on the internet."
1,Not as good as the show,All the game tries to do is make the same jokes the show has and put a littel game play in the middel
5,A Race to Plant,"Plantasia is a time management game in which you work to restore the gardens on an old, falling-apart estate. You're required to plant, harvest, and take care of your plants in order to earn enough to restore the garden statues. Plantasia offers four different gardens, each with a variety of levels, and you've got to restore them all to complete the game. I strongly agree with the previous reviewer who said that while this was similar to Cake Mania and Diner Dash in objective, it's different enough that it feels like a new kind of game. I'd classify it with the other farm-type games: Alice Greenfingers, Magic Farm, etc. I really enjoy this game: beautiful scenery, cute plants (they have faces and emotions) and lots of fun."
2,Not enough of a description,I purchase the birthday train for my niece every year. I usually have no problems but this year I bought a Used-Like New and it didn't include a box. I wish that would have been stated somewhere! Didn't have enough time to exchange it. Wish I would have paid the extra $6 for the New.
5,Matt Dusk's christmas album is great,This is my new Christmas favorite. I Enjoy listing to Matt's other CD's and this is my #1 choice for Christmas mustic - this season.If it were only longer - only 21+ minutes - I can't wait for his extended mix version (???) - I hope!Enjoy
2,Nice and stylish but awkward fitting and VERY difficult to keep in place on the dog.,"This style doggle is much nicer than the old goggle style doggles but, unfortunately, they don't fit as well as the old style doggles. The old style rested around the eye sockets but these sit on the bridge of the nose so the straps must be placed very strategially on your dog's face and if you have a small dog with a pointed muzzle you will have a heck of a time getting these to sit properly and stay on your dog. I've given up trying to put these on because they won't stay on my dog very long. The old style doggles stayed on her much longer with much less problems."
3,Cool looking doggie sun glasses,"Cool Looking small dog sun glasses. Adjustments work very well. Lens are not quite dark enough and are very easyto scratch up. But over all, I'd say they are a reasonable deal."
4,An enjoyable read with relatable humor,"I got sucked into the paranormal series with Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series (yes, pun intended) finding them to be quick reads. I'm not reading for huge character development nor for new ideas. I'm reading for a storyline that grabs me in a writing style that catches my interest.Looking for something in between novels, I stumbled upon Julie Kenner's demon hunter series, and was pleasantly entertained.Kate Connor provides an interesting heroine, whose adventures are enjoyable. The series is injected with a healthy bit of humor (not over the top, but enough for a few good laughs).This is brain fluff. Don't expect anything too earth shattering here, but it is fairly well written (in that there aren't blatant plot holes or contradictions, and you can move through the story easily)."
2,Caroe Demon Demon hunter soccer mom,"Being a fan of Julie Kenner other books I had hope for this book at all. While I sure other readers may actually like it with its jokes of Harry Potter marathons and the kids watching their mom take the dojo master down in karate class, I had the same problem I had with the Buffy The Vampire Slayer books. I'm sure I'd enjoy Kate Conner in a visual setting on TV. As I found BTVS missing something in it translation from visual TV show to written word book I found this book a disapointment compared to GOOD GHOULS and Julie's other stories."
3,"After weeks of schleping this around, I finally schlepped my way through it.","This book is what they make editors for! I don't know where Julie Kenner's was but someone should have took out most of the probably 30+ instances of the word ""schlep"", seriously, does this woman not know any other verbs? Also, i lost track of the amount of times she asked her neighbor to watch her kid for a ""desert"". Not that we ever see any of these happen, just hear about them ad nauseum. I'm giving the book 3 stars because I actually did get through it, all the elements of a good story are there, but the mechanics and the 1 dimensional characters will mostly just have you being apathetic about the whole book. I was curious to see if she improved with the next book in the series, but after reading the reviews here I don't think I will be punishing myself with that anytime soon. I'm glad I checked it out from the library instead of buying it."
3,Fun!,I really enjoyed this book! It was easy to read and left me wanting more...I can't wait to read the sequel!
4,"Funny, awesome book",Loved this book. I'm not normally a paranormal reader. You couldn't make me read about vampires or demons or whatever... but I like funny and a friend recommended this one. I really enjoyed it. Liked the brisk dialogue and engaging characters.
3,"a few belly laughs but I wanted it to be better, overall","A fun read that starts out better, much, than it finishes. Story threads are pretty abruptly wrapped up. Early scenes are especially funny and better written. I enjoyed this, though, I just wanted it to be better. Kinda wished it had been in smaller paperback form instead of the pricer version. I'll get the next in the series from the library."
2,Flat,"This book has a great premise, but the characters are one dimentional and the plot overly simple. You can see the ending from a mle away and the chateracters never really develop. As a fan of Mary Janice Davidson Kim Harrison and Laurel K. Hamilton, this really pales in comparison. There's almost nothing in the book that is 'dark' and it's almost a Christain demon story. (For those offended by the sex in the Anita Blake books, this might be the one for you.) The best scenes in the book are between Kate and her teen daugher. Too bad, wonderful premise."
1,Carpe Demon doesn't make it,"Carpe Demon was a very uninteresting book. There was no character development, each person in the book was bland, without any individual personality. Things happened slowly."
3,Boring snoozefest,"While well-written, this book is pretty dull overall. It's less about demon-hunting and almost entirely about how Mom gets through her day with two kids. I do the same thing and am less interested in reading about it for fun. This mom just has to juggle a few demon-related tasks in with the rest of her day of grocery shopping, carpooling, parent-teacher meetings, house cleaning, etc. Reading about her stressful day does not help me relax from mine. The characters and story have a lot of potential but I still had to drag myself through the rest of the book. This is more a story about Buffy getting married (for the second time) and then suddenly turning 40-something without ever working out a day in her life."
4,fun read,"I enjoyed it and completed it in a few days. I gave it only four stars because it could get a bit tedious with all her daily household activities, but the characters are likable and it keeps you guessing til the end. I will be reading the next one in the series!"
2,More soccer mom than demon-hunting,"Perhaps you have to be more in the soccer mom stage of life to appreciate this book, but the only lasting impression I got from the heroine is a mental recitation of daily chores which happen to include ""investigate supernatural activity (while lying to family)"". If we were to take the Buffy comparison seriously, I'd have to say Buffy has suffered some mental damage during her time as a wife and young mother which sucked away her charm and wit.Anyway, this book sets up the characters and background for what I expect will be a higher level of action. The heroine feels a bit darker in her viewpoint than some of J. Kenner's previous books. A light read, definitely, with a shallow plot that gets us to the point where we now know her characters' situation and supporting cast. Hopefully, the next installment in this series expands on the characters and gives a more interesting elaboration on Kenner's written world."
3,Demon-hunting in suburbia,"Kate Connor lives the life of a stay-at-home wife and mother in the pleasant little down of San Diablo. However, Kate has a past, in her youth she used to be a demon-hunter, and now her past is catching up with her. Demons have come to San Diablo, and Kate has to polish up her rusty demon-hunting skills and go out and save the world again. She finds that it's difficult to combine being a demon-hunter with looking after a two-year-old and a teenager. also it's difficutl to figure out who are the good guys and who are the bad.this is quite an amusing story, though I felt there was too little demon-hunting and too much detail about Kate's wifely activities. The first half of the book is a bit slow, though the action takes off more in the second half. I thought it was quite good, but I would have enjoyed it more if it had been both funnier and more exciting."
5,Demons beware,"Any writer that can keep smiles and mystery going at the same time deserves to be on the New York Times list.I enjoyed Givenchy Code so much, I bought Carpe Demon.The reading is again quick and fluid, the plotting intricate, yet the stories are anything but similar.Cudos again to Ms. Kenner.I await your next trade paper effort -- impatiently."
3,Too fluffy for me,"This is a fun, frothy little read about a retired demon slayer who is now a stay-at-home mom and more at ease juggling dinner parties and car pools. But, alas, you can't escape those demons forever. She's called back into active duty at the ripe old age of 38 and this story follows her attempts to keep a teenager, a 2 year old and a politically ambitious (and slightly clueless) husband happy all the while secretly hunting demons on the sly. It's cute and entertaining but not at all gory (darn) and there's too much focus on boring domesticity and not enough action."
4,"Listen... But, My God! That Family Photo!!!","The Cowsills (their real name), appeared in the late '60's as another ""family"" pop group. Unlike the Osmonds and the Partridge Family, they produced some fairly musically mature songs. This collection contains the best. ""Hair"" made the public take them seriously with it's bouncy, bridge driven track. ""Indian Lake"" brings back every summer vacation, and ""The Rain, The Park And Other Things"" is another great song (silly title) that will have you back on memory lane. ""Love American Style"" evokes that popular old TV sit-com. Playing all their own instruments and vocals, this was a talented family. This disc has also been remastered, so the tape hiss is gone."
3,"Good, but one important song missing","My favorite Cowsills songs are definitely ""The Rain, The Park & Other Things"" and ""What Is Happy"". I was disappointed that one of them was missing from this in other ways great compilation.A pleasant surprise was the ""six-six-six""-song that I for some reasons had not noticed before, it is quite good."
3,Mono and stereo,"Just a quick note for those who prefer stereo versions. The following songs on this CD are the mono versions: ""Most of All"", ""The Rain, the Park, & Other Things"", ""We Can Fly"", ""Poor Baby"", and ""Love American Style"". The Best of the Cowsills CD (1994 issue) has the stereo versions of ""The Rain, the Park, & Other Things"" and ""We Can Fly"", but otherwise a mostly different selection of songs and no liner notes."
3,Worth Having,"This cd isnt completely wack nor extremely tight. It is just average. The best songs being We will Ball, Massive Heat, Deja Vu( best song), Cross Bronx Expressway. Another song That is overlooked is A Night In The Bronx with Lord & Gunz. It could do without the sex skit at the beginning but the song is Sensational with a SUPERIOR CHORUS. "" Do you wanna [...], meeeeeeee!"". That may be the illest song on the cd even though it lasts all of 2 and half minutes. Dont make this first priority though."
2,A disappointment.,"When I first heard these guys on ""Deja Vu"" I loved them, but this album is not that good. The only songs that hit really hard were ""Massive Heat"", becuase it featured my favorite rapper, Kurupt, the aforementioned ""Deja Vu"", and the prophetic ""My Time To Go"". The rest was disappointing. I don't really dig their styles, either. Well, maybe next time...."
3,OK,"This album was sort of a disapointment to me. You all remember the single ""Deja Vu"", and it was bangin'. BUt sadly, nothing else but the intro was also. Even though these two are great exceptional mc's, this album was sub par. If you absolutely love the singles on the cd, get it. But if you dont you shouldnt get this: Because they all sound the same(cheap production)."
1,This is absolute garbage,"It's SUCKS @$$! Weak beats, weak rhymes.... they almost softer that puffy! Only song I liked was Massive Heat wit stick fingaz cause sticky is da MAN yo!"
1,WWWAAAAAACCKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm gonna save a-lot of you guys money. DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE. As long as you heard ""We Will Ball"", and ""Deja Vu"" you've heard this album. I know they could have done better than this Sesame Street soundtrack with cursing."
1,Horrible,There are only three tracks on this album worth listening too and that's it. What was all the hype about. Where the hell are they now? They made some money then bounced. I expected more from these Bronx cats!
4,Sporadic volume,"I really enjoy this CD, as do my children, but the sound quality is lacking. Ms. Streep speaks in low, quiet tones(practically whispering at times), then the orchestra starts playing VERY loudly. I understand that it is supposed to be dramatic, but the extremes are a little excessive. I have tried to listen to it on different cd players, in my car, it's all the same. It's a great story, great narrator, great music, just a poor production. I would buy it again, just be forewarned!"
3,Divertingly Entertaining,"Short and sweet story about a young Japanese man working at a Japanese-language bookshop in London. He is apparently a ""rising star"" in certain circles in Japan and has been sent to England to polish his English and his interactions with foreigners. This allows the author to simultaneously poke fun at elements of both British and Japanese culture--albeit aiming only at the obvious targets. The main action centers on his involvement with a highly unsuitable""punk"" woman, and later, with a more upscale woman. An economical, comic 160 pages."
4,...,"I think the cd is pretty good. I went to the same elementary and middle school as her. She was a grade above me, but she was always singing, when I was in 7th and she was in 8th she left second semester to start recording her cd. She also tried out for the role as Selena when she was younger, but unfortunatly didn't get the part. I wasn't friends with her, but it was hard not to know who she was. It was pretty cool seeing someone you went to school with come out with a cd. But I'd pick up the cd if I were you. The songs are catchy and they are pretty cool."
5,An Amazing Girl!,"Myra may only be 15, but she is more talanted than some music artists you'll hear on the radio. Her first single, ""Dancing In The Street"", ended up as the title song for the movie ""Recess: Schools Out"". This remake is better than the original motown classic. Myra has been the opening act for Aaron Carter on his last 2 tours. The second single off this album, ""Miracles Happen (When You Believe)"", will be appearing in the new movie with Julie Andrews and Mandy Moore, ""The Princess Diaries"". But Myra has another talent. Acting. Myra will be in the movie ""Max Keeble's Big Move"" schedueled for an October 5th release. Normally, I find 3 to 4 songs that I don't like on an album and rate it a 4 if the rest of the songs are superb. Theres only two songs I don't care for on this album, so you may wonder why I gave it 5 stars. I did this because I feel that all the other songs could make it as hit singles on the radio! Do yourself a favor and buy this cd today!"
4,Cool,I think this was a great CD. I think it was so great because it had music on it that was almost perfect except for like 1 or 2 songs on it that were too slow or just not my type.
3,Bubblegum-Pop With a Latino Twist,"Not a bad album for her first. Best songs are ""Miracles Happen(When You Believe)""-from The Princess Diaries, "" Wishing on the Same Star""- a classy ballad, and "" Dancing in the Street""-an upbeat remake of the Martha and the Vandellas hit single.Some of the songs are really corny and are made up of soooo much bubblegum they'll give you a musical toothache, like ""Hanging up on You"", "" Lie,Lie,Lie"", "" Candy Boy"", and "" Girls Like Boyz"". Myra's got an okay voice, but it's nothing too special. But, on the other hand, this again is not too bad for her first album."
3,Miracles Happen. But Myra's Not One Of Them.,"Yes, she's good. Yes, she's a Britney Spears rip off. Yes, she's good looking. But are we going to take her seriously with those song titles? I own this album, and I DO like it, but there's so much that could be improved. I bought it judged on ""Miracles Happen"" and I found the rest of it was pretty good, but aren't we all kind of tired of having all those tens of hundreds of latin singers that insist on recording every song in spanish? I'm not discriminating---it's the truth. The best cuts are ""Hanging Up On You"" ""As If"" and ""Where You At?"" The rest are either bland or cheesy ballads. Myra needs another try. If Britney is bubblegum pop, Myra is cheese."
5,Great!,"There's an apparent difference between everyday pop stars and Myra: Myra's songs are unique, laced with her own independance and talent. (Especially Miracles Happen, I LOVE that song! It's awesome!) I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but to me, pop singers like britney and christina, all their songs are alike. and not just their own, but also compared to each other. (i'm trying to take the most sensitive approach to this topic)I recommend her CD to anyone who enjoys listening to things that aren't the same as the song before."
1,Another Karen Carpenter. (I think not!),"Wow, another girl singer! Just what we need. You know, I'm getting tired of CDs with really good songs and really inexperienced singers singing on them. That's what I'd call this CD. She sounds like one of those midgets from the ""Wizard Of Oz."" My advice to whomever is reading this is to just save your money. This CD will be much cheaper in 5 months."
1,It's Black?,"Just received my Browns turtleneck and guess what? It's a black turtleneck. Yes, it has the Cleveland Browns official orange helmet logo on the neck but its on a black turtleneck. I don't get. I thought the Browns official color was, well brown? Put that logo on a nice chocolate brown turtleneck and I would wear this in a heartbeat. But black? Save that color for the Bengals or the Steelers and give me brown for the Browns. Oh, and no pre-printed return label. Geesh!"
3,Nothing new here - but beautifully formatted book,"Hamel's latest book contains a few important ideas, such as the central importance of business concept innovation. However, the constant refrain of ""innovate, innovate, innovate!"" is hardly new to anyone familiar with works such as Built to Last, and The Age of Unreason. Aimed at anyone wanting to be a business revolutionary, including ""gray-haired revolutionaries"" in sleepy old companies, this book offers a few useful ways of thinking and steps to take to shake up your business. However, much of the useful content can be found in Hamel's recent HBR articles, and the excessively breezy writing style triumphs over actionable content. Those most attracted to this book will find the least in it, whereas those most in need of its message will be unlikely to pick it up."
3,On Quantum Innovation,"Gary Hamel seems to have borrowed a page out of Tom Peters' book with respect to getting provocative and challenging the reader's models of thinking. The style is breathless and evangelistic, and it seems that you are attending a lecture by Hamel.However the message that Hamel makes is a pertinent one, even though the examples he cites may not be too great (like Enron) anymore.The crux of his point is that organizations have to foster revolutionary thought and business models internally or else they will be thrown off by external businesses.All in all, an engaging book, if you are the CEO of a big corporation that is not growing and are willing to try anything to reverse the trend."
2,More New Economy Blather,"While many of Hamel's writings delivered solid business roadmaps, in this book he appears to have ""crossed over"" into a world of subjectivity and exageration. This book has many ""if you don't reinvent yourself everyday"" urban myths. To read this you'd think that huge companies are becoming obsolete and going bankrupt daily. Published at the beginning of the year 2000, the book is almost obsolete by November. The idea of business concept innovation is the main theme of the book and the reader can tell that Hamel, now working in California, bought the whole dot.com story about making everyone else's business model obsolete. We now know this is nonsense and as a result the person whom the book calls ""the greatest strategist in the world"" looks rather silly as the ink still dries on his book. This book like many that have come before it, uses massive exageration to sell books. Follow the advice in this book and you too can end up like the companies featured in the book - beware."
1,Opportunistic blahblah in Oprah Winfrey style,"This book from the so called 'mangement guru' Hamel lost all its standing when the Enron debacle emerged. mr Hamel has used Enron as worldclass example and innovative company. What a nonsense. Second, you need to know that this writer was in the Chairman advisory board of Enron.Where is your credibility as management expert with making such enormous mistakes ?!On top of that Hamel is trying to hide his past with Enron. The quoted flaptext of the book on his website does not mention Enron anymore. But, he forgot that it ist still in the flaptext in the printed book.Do not spend money on a would-be-guru who thought he was right and now is trying to hide his past after finding out he was dead wrong."
1,Disappointing: A Slick Re-Packaging of Warmed-Over Ideas,"Granted, Hamel is a strategy genius. But there is little in this book that you haven't read before, either by him or others, both in books and the numerous e-commerce magazines. The book has a cool, revolutionary design but its content can be grasped just by reading through the sub-headings. This is a good refresher course on what companies need to do in the face of the Internet revolution sweeping the business world. But those who haven't already got the message are unlikely to ""get it"" from Hamel's hectoring and rah-rah enthusiasm. If you already ""get it"" then you really don't need this book."
3,Interesting but a little naive,"Well written book with remarkable attention on the logic flow of topics.Chapter 8 Design Rules for Innovation is definitely the best part of the book (conceptual vision to implement Systemic Innovation in your company)I found a little naive the overall approach aimed to explain as to break the constraints in your ""sat down"" corporate fighting from the inside: the examples are as real as actually exceptional (Samsung on games, IBM on Internet, Shell and so on). It doesn't semm that those business revolution fighters have gained a lot from their efforts ..."
2,Enron cited often,"Some good ideas on driving innovation, but in hindsight, some of the cited companies haven't passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance. One of my favorite quotes from the book - ""At Enron, failure - even of the type that ends up on the front page of The Wall Street Journal - doesn't necessarily sink a career"". Yeah right! This kind of thinking puts one in jail."
3,OK.,"I've found that when writers write a non-fiction book with T.S. Eliot styling they usually have nothing of value to say.It's a good book, but too fluffy at times. You should be afraid if your consultant comes into a meeting with this tucked in his arm."
5,A extraordinary book on business strategy,"Hamel have done it again. Revolutionary, creative, innovative. A must read for those managing business in the new economy. People lyke Hamel, Prahalad, Govindarjan and Stuart Wells are proposing a new view for strategic thinking. If you really want to fire up your thinking about strategy making you've got to read Leading the Revolution and Choosing the Future (from Stuart Wells)"
2,Hamel is having a Tom Peters Moment...,"Usually, Gary Hamel's books are invaluable. So, when I saw that this book was coming out, I ordered the audio version to listen to while driving to clients' offices. I thought I would arrive energized, filled with great ideas, etc.However, what I heard was a Tom Petersish rant. Lots of exhortations and very little practical information on what to do in real life. Lots of advice about being courageous and having wonderful ideas and getting a product champion, and... hope he is paying royalties to Tom...The problem is probably the fact that the audio tape is an abridged version of the book. Hopefully the book has lots more meat. But this was most definitely a major disappointment."
1,"Overpriced, under informationed","""Competing for the Future"" was a great book, Hamel's next and solo act was a great disappointment.It seems the author started with a number of the very thoughtful charts from ""Competing"" and then just added 50 to 75 ""questions"" such as ""Am I a real innovator?"" As a result, the intellectual insightfulness was minimal. Secondly, the book came across as an unspiring rewrite of Tom Peters. The author should let Peters do his own sthick. Next, if the author used the term ""besotted (sp) CEO"" one more time,"" I would have..."" Finally, the graphs and colors add cost but no value."
3,"100,000 feet","Hamel's ideas are neat, but when reading this keep in mind that his ideas may work for an IBM or Ford. However, in the smaller firm, they'll be met with laughter. I almost believe that what you read here is Hamel's own promotional material for his consulting services. Still, there's a lot of good ideas to keep in a business leaders head - just be careful about taking everything he says as the word of God."
3,some good thoughts but lot of rehash ...,"A lot of the early ideas in the book are rehashes of things that have appeared in earlier literature. However, the later chapters on how to innovate within the context of a big monolithic company and for a big company on how to provide a great environment for innovation are worth reading (esp. for those that have been sleeping for the past 5-7 years).I wouldn't worry about reading the book cover to cover. Flip through it real quick ..."
3,"Deals with Romans, not Britons, mostly","Sadly, the subject 'the rebels of Roman Britain' runs to one chapter -- that on Boudica (if you disclude the chapters on- the fighters against the initial invasions, and- the Northern British). So, pressed into service to fill out this still-slender volume are the Roman governors of the province who used their positions to attempt to usurp the leadership of the Empire.That said, it's a well-written book, and the early, English chapters are quite stirring."
4,didnt expect the black...,"I LOVE this poster. The only problem I have with it is that the black is a velvet type...it's a little strange and I didn't know it was going to be like that when I ordered it. I'm not sure if I didn't read the description as I should have..but in case it isn't listed, the black is a velvet feeling material!!"
3,surprised?,"it was a cool poster online but when it arrived, it was made of fabric and spraypainted in neon colors instead of print. so i guess that was a weird surprise? still havent decided whether i like the surprise or not..."
1,terrible,Poster came in great quality and its nice and all but it took 3 weeks to get here when I choose 3-5 business days for shipping.
3,Runs Large,"Adorable costume! Although, my daughter was swimming in it! Unfortunatly, it ran larger than the normal size. I purchased this item for my daughter to wear for one Girl Scout event so we tucked and pinned it in a few places. Overall it's great for a costume, but be prepared to take it in if you purchase your child's actual size."
5,Extra extra,"This collection was purchased based upon the performers; not Mozart. Regret? On the contrary. They helpedturn on the proverbial light to Mozart.The three were meant to bring life to this work. I expected ""la-de-da"" and received a powerful interpretation of fine music. Midori is always Midori.Wow."
2,Flawed,"For ""period"" buffs, who says that authentic must mean bereft of emotionality? The notes of the Sinfonia are emotional. To me, bittersweet, nostalgic. The reviewer critical of the ""romantic"" style of expression, of course, cannot transport himself to the 18th century and it occurs to me that a performance is successful if it has an impact on the listener. Period. That said, this performance is not mpressive. It doesn't sing; it is muddy, plodding and lugubrious. The conductor and to a lesser extent the soloists have missed the point, but not because they've layered some ""romantic"" style on the piece. The slow tempi do not have to be a problem necessarily. There are many outstanding versions of this piece available on CD. It's a shame because Midori is a fine artist; maybe this is not her repertoire."
1,Hoped for more and got less.,My expectations were high and the game was just hard to look at. 2D graphis are boring and I will leave it at that. Games that only allow one angle of view on the field of battle are to me not 3D.
2,"Good fun, needs a patch though","When I first got this game it failed to run on either my windows 2000 or xp systems. I later reformatted both computers and discovered that this game fails to run on a fully updated install of windows. Although there is one patch out at the moment, it fails to fix the problem. I'm hoping another patch is in the works that will fix it. What I have played of the game however, is fantastic. If and when this game gets another patch, I would raise my overall score to 5, until then, it gets 2."
4,The TRUTH,"The only bad thing about this game and it's expansion (Battle for Europe) is this game rather poorly advertised and not very well supported.Although single player is just bad, the multilayer is really outstanding, unlike any other strategy game. Once you master basic skills in this game, you will enjoy it and never get bored of it.The only problem is that not so many people play it, so you might have trouble finding desired opponents from time to time, but otherwise, it worth the money."
1,So much potential - So much disappointment,"Having anxiously awaited the US release of this game, I was so excited to finally be able to play it. American Conquest and America Fights Back were so enjoyable. The Napoleonic period is my fav and I was expecting great things from Cossacks II, the next edition in a series from CDV. Basic to my expectations was that the game would be bug free. As it turns out, the game has some serious bugs in it. For one, enemy units on occassion, will actually fight against themselves. Secondly, although I run the game on a Dell XPS 600, which more than satisfies every system requirement, the game has a tendency to crash.CDV has issued one patch, but clearly additional work needs to be done to make this game playable. Someday, I hope game designers will debug their programs prior to their release to the unsuspecting public."
5,Great Soundtrack for an Amazing Book/Movie,"I saw the movie first before reading the book. I know, how horrible! But I really enjoyed the book. It is one my all-time favorites. Anyway, the soundtrack is great. I'm a huge fan of instrumentals, so I'm probably a bit biased, but it sounds amazing. There's Celtic hints obviously because the movie and book take from that time, but it also is just a nice instrumental soundtrack. I hadn't heard of the composer before, but I will definitely look for him in the future because I love this cd. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves instrumentals, soundtracks, or orchestras."
2,So So,"I loved the book, so I bought the CD. I often buy sound tracks from films. Many of them are wonderful music. However, I was sorry I bought this album. Perhaps it was great with the movie, but it did not stand well on it's own."
3,would have been better without the caterwauling,"The instrumental part of the soundtrack is very nice. But after a few listens the ""oooh ahh la de da"" wailing on the part of Aeone reminds me of cats in heat. I would have preferred just the instrumentals, or at least to have some of the extended wailing cut out."
1,Doesn't hold up without the visual,"I was extremely disappointed in this soundtrack after watching the wonderful made-for-T.V.- movie of Mists of Avalon. The soundtrack worked wonderfully when watching the movie, but for me, the music alone just didn't work. I'm hoping eventually the video is sold. Haven't seen that yet anywhere. Has anyone? Anyhow, will be selling this CD after only one playing of it."
2,not a calming mist,"The television movie was wonderful; but I guess I forgot how many drums and banging noises were in the background. Loreena McKennitt is wonderful to listen to, but it's not the soothing soundtrack I was hoping for with the Ahhhhhhhhhh singing and clanging of steel."
4,"Fitting, understated, and seldom overpowering","Lee Holdridge had his work cut out for him when he took this scoring assignment, what with having to write bookends around an existing Loreena McKennitt song, but the result is a noble meld of sounds instead of what could have been a bone-jarring clash of styles. Holdridge's score seldom overplays the drama (truth be told, I wish the movie's director had the same dramatic sense as his choice of composer), and when things do get boisterous, such as the pagan hunt scene, it's not out of place. In this respect, the score actually outclasses the miniseries a bit."
5,Music by Lee Holdridge,"I don't usually enjoy ""songs"" on my film score CD's but the vocal work by McKennitt (I own and adore her ""mask and the Mirror"" CD ) and Aeone work very well creating the Celtic mood for this magical score. But the real glory comes from Lee Holdridge himself.His sweeping orchestral work creates a wonderful sense of a time and place, lost to the world, and only felt in our dreams and our hearts. The Celtic pieces will set you senses soaring and If you love James Horner's ""Braveheart"" or even Trevor Jones' ""Merlin"" then you will find this is a very fine and beautifully performed (by the Munich Symphony Orchestra )addition to anyones collection of late (very late) romantic period orchestral music that has forever been lost in the mists of time."
2,Won't upload,This program installed and worked fine except when it came to uploading to camera. Can't do it even after repeated email exchanges with tech support. Shopping again.
1,HORABLE HORABLE HORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could rate this Zero stars, I would. It says on the front that it works with analog and digital camcorders. It might but you need I link for that, not USB. But my Analog camcorder doesn't have a I link port. So 6 months later I sell my analog for a digital (it is very hard to find editing software for analog camcorders anyway) and I get an I link adapter for my computer. IT STILL DOESN""T WORK! I E-mail tech support 6 times. each time they tell me to adjust something different in the settings and finally they just said they didn't know what to do. Circuit City wont let me refund it and Neither will Broderbund so im stuck with it. It is an overall waist of time and if you want to edit videos, find something else that actually works."
1,Bad bad product.... Worthless,Didn't do what it was supposed to do and was just terrible. Not worth the cost of shipping even.
4,Excellent Look,An excellent look at the Commonwealth forces that fought in Korea. Brian Cull continues his thorough and engaging style with a look at a long neglected aspect of the Korean War. Looking forward to volume 2.
4,An essential reading for cognitive tools research.,"The first and throughout book on the computer-based cognitive tools. Dividing the research and opinions on two camps, that of student modeller AI camp and the tool oriented camp, the editors attemp to find a middle ground for the issues.I found it to be one of my essential books for my doctoral dissertation which is also about the use of computer-based cognitive tools in music education.(my dissertation is listed in the abstracts)The book includes a fairly good definition of the concept of a computer-based cognitive tool, and has grounds for applying the concept to other computer technologies."
2,Microsoft Picture It Software,Product did not come with the mandatory 'Key Code' to load/register this software. Vendor unaware of this fact and immediately refunded money. Please note that you must have the 'key code' to utilize this software.
5,Great sk8 album,"This is one of the greatest sk8 albums for all of you skaters. If your into great guitar riffs and great music to get you ready to have a great time on your skateboard This is a must have. Tracks 1,2,3,6,7,8,and the hidden song at the end are the best. The hidden song starts at the 15:05 mark. You should also check out their video CKY2K. Come on skaters, rock and punk fans buy this album now!!!!! It'll blow you away. This is my review and my name is Beach bum 3/7."
5,Cky Vol. 1,It was in perfect shape. Shipped to me in a timely manner. I will definately purchase from them again
5,Can you say Revolution?,"This album is the best thing to happen to music since the invention of the radio! If you haven't heard already, let me be the first to tell that CKY is going to change the face of rock n' roll forever. This CD is a definite must for anyone's collection...forget about all the other bands out there because CKY is the only one that matters! This is the future of ROCK!!!!"
5,most creative riffs ever,"this is the most creative cd I own. I got this CD before it was rereleased on Island and had a Parental Advisory sticker put on it for some reason. This cd has no cuss words at all. The only reason I could see for them to put a Parental Advisory sticker on it is ""Promiscous Daughter""(great song by the way), in which he repeats ""I caught my daughter givin' head to my brother"", which in my opinion isn't even that bad. The best song on the CD is definitely Disengage the Simulator or Sara's Mask. A MUST HAVE CD. YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO."
5,Fantastic,"For those that are unfamiliar with cKy's history (see the CKY Documentary, [...], or wikipedia for more), many of the songs on this album originated from Deron and Jess' previous band 'OiL'. Certainly, 96 Quite Bitter Beings is by far cKy's most popular song, although the entire Vol. 1 album is freaking fantastic. The unique sounds of each song is demostrated by the contrasts between, say, Rio Bravo, The Human Drive In Hi-Fi, Lost In A Contraption, and Sara's Mask. There's so many different styles within this one CD, yet you can tell it's all cKy. The only song that doesn't really do anything for me is ""To All Of You"", although it's not a bad song, it just doesn't quite compare to some of the other masterpieces on this album. Also the 'Rio Bravo Reprise' and 'Halfway House' hidden after To All Of You are worth checking out.Note that Volume 1 is being REMASTERED (again) and RE-RELEASED in the near future (probably 2007)."
5,CKY KICKS A$$,"CKY is so amazing. Theyre so different from everything that is out right now. They are all extremely talented musicians and I'd reccomend them to anyone but especially people like me who are tired of all these little rock bands running around like Simple Plan, NFG, and especially Good Charlotte. Bands like these are simply are a fad, all copying off eachother. CKY has a truly unique sound and they are just awesome. CKY FOREVER!"
4,The Rougher Side of CKY,"This is CKY's debut album. This version is remastered and includes 2 music videos. It's definitely a lot harder rocking and louder than CKY's more recent, mellower efforts. Highlights of this CD include ""96 Quite Bitter Beings"" and ""Disengage The Simulator"". A great album to play in the car or at parties."
5,great cd for any cky or jackass fan,this is a great cd for anyone who has seen/liked the CKY videos.this cd has a track from Tony Hawk 3(96 quite bitter beings).disengage the simulater is a great song.when i got this cd it was the bet and...IT STILL IS!!! i have had it in my cd player for a few months now.this cd is a great buy and a must have for any jackass/CKY fan
5,So good!,"I know Cky only from Jackass, because here in Germany they are not famous, but it is good music! I hope that they will come to Germany one time to give a concert! (Of course) I'm going to join it! I will look for the Films of Bam; Cky, Cky2k and Cky3; here in Germany ! Must be great!"
1,its really a shame...,"Chances are, if you are looking at this book you will be taking sheng li's class at UF. There is good news and bad news, however, the good news is only for people who already know semiconductor physics. This book will not teach you much you don't already know, and good luck with the HW! I would recommend this book only to people who need it for sheng li's class because his tests are really based entirely on your ability to memorize the info in this book (no understanding required). Anyone else, go pick something else. There are a million books written by good authors who know what learning is about."
2,Beware - Device supplies power to PC,"I noticed that the lights on my PC would stay on even when the computer was shut off, and my machine was giving me problems starting. This USB hub connects its power supply to your computers power supply, feeding it with +5 volts even when your computer is shut off. This is bad for your computer and can cause strange problems."
5,THE PERFECT HUB,this usb hub worked great. the cord was long enough to fit my needs. the ports are perfecty spaced so it can fit certain flash drives.
5,Don't Look Back Charlie - This is fantastic!,"Charlie's Talent knows no limits! One of my favourite CD's in my collection. His deep strong voice grabs you and his lyrics are outstanding. It is such a shame that we don't here enough of him in Australia. I've been listening to this album and his others since it came out in 1989, and it's not the kind of album that you play half a dozen times and get bored of - I can't get enough! Keep searching for more!! Mel"
3,Refreshing music,"I love this CD, absolutely fantastic. Charlie's voice fits well with all the songs. This is the perfect CD for anyone who is a fan of 80's rock music.My favorite song is track 6 - ""For All We Know"" written by Danny Wilde. ""Cry Little Sister"" features Bryan Adams on backing vocals, and is a version of the Lost Boys theme song.Fans of Charlie Sexton who want to hear other songs by him should try and trace the soundtrack album to ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"" - features a song by him called ""In Deep"" that's missing from this album."
5,Worth its weight in gold...,"Beautiful, soothing music that has proven to calm and quiet my active toddlers. it's the only collection that has actually quieted them enough to indulge in a much-needed nap. And, though they may be children's lullabies, it's one of my favorite CDs as well. It is definitely not the typical collection of cute little children's songs but wonderful listening for all ages."
2,A frugal woman knows she doesn't need this book...,"This book was published by IVillage. It is a compilation of postings from IVillage members -- advice on how to save money, time, etc. The sections all begin with ""A frugal woman knows..."" For example, ""A frugal woman knows not to carry balances on her credit card"" (but the book does not go into particular detail on debt reduction). Or ""A frugal woman knows that to save money on groceries, she should try generic brands and loss leaders and always shop from a list."" (uh-huh) My advice: A frugal woman knows that all of this information (if you don't know it already) can be found for FREE on the IVillage Web site. Don't waste your money. (Or else check it out of your local library.)"
2,Very basic,Although this book is packed with many interesting tips I found it just that - a compilation of tips and lacking any real in depth issues. Most of the generic tips I have read before in other frugal publications and others are just plain common sense. Its a good book for those just beginning to seek sorting out their finances - but far too basic for others that have already been treading this path for a year or so.
5,A Happy Customer,Product arrived on time. Used 1 of the batteries right away and it has worked perfectly.
1,Incredibly inept storytelling!,"As I forced myself to read through this collection, story after story unrolled one cliched situation after another. The tales are one dimensional and show so little origonality or depth, I am surprised this writer has been able to sell so many novels. Amateurish writing both in style and concept. What a disappointment . . ."
2,no jewish cookbook,I ordered this book thinking that is was a jewish cookbook. But I am verry sorry that it is story and no a jewish cookbook. That is the reason I returned the book.
1,Defective,The product didn't work so I returned it for a replacement which also didn't work. Its being returned. For some reason the box won't switch to the other computer.
2,Misleading,Buyer beware as I was not. You are only getting one candle for $10. I can get far more than 1 pillar candle for $10 just about anywhere. Not worth it!
5,This ROCKS!,"Hey!! I would like to say this cd ROCKS and the songs are so cool. The tracks are as fallows: #1{Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know}(Album Version)[3:51] #2{Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know}(Hex Hector Radio Mix)[4:02] #3{Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know}(Hex Hector Club Mix)[10:12]. Ok we all have heard the ""Album Version"" but the remixes are so much better they are fast and kind of Trancy-Techno like Alice Deejay, they never fail to fill the dance floor, and are worth every penny. Buy this cd!"
4,Don't let me be the last to know,"Yo, everyone, this is the UK maxi single part one. It has 3 tracks. 1)Don't let me be the last to know- radio edit. 2)Don't let me be the last to know- remix. 3)Don't let me be the last to know- remix. I love this song. It's great. I rated it a 4 because part 2 of this maxi single has the video."
2,Nice looking but unstable stands,"I chose these stands for their height, curved appearance, and because the top plates were relatively larger than competitive models. The big problem, however, is that the stands are unstable because their bases are too small and unfortunately, these stands can't be loaded with sand or buckshot to improve the stability. If you have hardwood floors and zero foot traffic near your speakers, you might be OK, but anyone else with stability concerns should think twice before buying these.These stands do require assembly but they're easy to put together. I didn't have any of the assembly difficulties that the first reviewer described."
4,"A quality stand, but a bit pricey","What can I say? They're speaker stands and they hold my speakers up next to my TV, so mission pretty much accomplished. They look rather sleek with my setup. They come with rubber feet for flat surfaces and rubber spikes for carpet, a convenient plus. Remember, these are 3 feet high, so they'll tip easier than shorter ones. It's no Bell'Os fault,you'd need an inconveniently large base to make it much better. The platform on top is about 7'x7', so those of you with larger bookshelf speakers should remember to use double-sided tape, which this does come with."
2,Color is black,"By looking at pictures, I thought these stands had a red tint to them. But the a purely black, which is not noted in description. The other thing not noted is that there is some assembly required. Usually not a big deal and there aren't too many parts. BUT in this case the holes don't line up well (yes I'm assembling correctly). So assembly has become rather difficult and has lead to some scratches. It's a fairly nice looking stand, but with the experience I've had, I would've shopped further. Note that there are several sellers of this item on Amazon, I unfortunately chose the most expensive of the two (noticed this later of course)."
4,Excellent light case for Nano,"If you want a thin, lightweight case to protect the Nano from scratches, this works well. If you need protection from dropping, you'll want something more substantial. There is a hard plastic insert that covers the screen. The picture shows a cutout for the touchpad. Mine came with no opening but the controls work fine through the case. Everything is accessible with the cover on, but the hold button is a little hard to slide. The belt clip works well, attaches and unattaches easily, but is a bit bulky. My only complaint is that there should be a loop at the bottom center of the case so that the Nano is balanced when using the neck strap. Overall though, it works well and I'd buy it again."
2,Afghans to KNIT and crochet???,"I agree with the previous reviewer - the crocheted afghans are pretty, and if you're looking for granny-square versions, this is a wonderful source.However, don't be misled into thinking that knit and crochet afghans are presented in anything like equal numbers, as the book's title implies. Out of 100 afghans, a mere 14 are knit. Some are innovative, and some are just the same old thing all over again.I've read books and used patterns by Jean Leihauser and Rita Weiss before, and these seem to be up to their usual caliber.Overall, I give the book a 2.5. While most of the afghans are pretty, and are photographed nicely, the underrepresentation of knit afghans costs the book 2.5 stars from this (primarily) knitter. I probably would have scored the book higher if I hadn't been sadly misled by the title.Better wishes next time, ladies!"
5,Awesome and beautiful quilts that you can really make.,"It will take you a lifetime to make all these afghans, but they are all a feast for the eyes. There is something for every taste and skill level.Happy crocheting and knitting!"
2,Wish the lenses were bigger & darker - even though I ordered large!,"Good concept. Just wish the lenses were bigger an perhaps less flat across the lenses. The lenses smash against my dog's eyes. Tried adjusting the nose piece to prevent this. But after a few steps, the glasses don't stay in place and continue to smush his eyes. I have a pit bull mix with a pretty broad nose. This may work well for other breeds. Also would like the lenses to be darker. They seem fairly light. They are much lighter than in the pictures."
4,Review for formal,"The book seems promising, particularly for beginners, who wish to take up the study on formal methods"
3,Seek the Riverside solos instead,"It is sad to say, but Monk was not in top form during these sessions--at least not when you listen to his two Riverside solo outings. Much of the same material was covered there, and Monk sounded more at ease and playful. Once again I fault Columbia. As usual, the current box set is overpriced (for material they have sat on for 30 years)and slickly-packaged. It is a valid complaint when one looks at the original album art which often portrayed Monk in clownish get-ups in an attempt to make him look hip to late-60s music buyers. Riverside, on the other hand, always treated the man with respect and the recordings reflect that. Check out the documentry: ""Straight, No Chaser"" as Monk records a Columbia session. He is frustrated and the producer is condesending. Granted there is valuable music in this collection, but novice buyers should stir clear of his later material. Columbia-Sony is gouging the consumer."
5,Crystal Clarity,Sublime music. Perfect singing. The treasure is When David Heard. The spareness and simplicity of the Tallis Scholars' rendering of this piece highlights its text in a way that may break your heart. This single piece is worth the price of the disc. The rest is just so much superb gravy.
5,I love third stage,I love this album but the question is this compact-disc everything it could be in terms of SOUND REPRODUCTION???I think not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Audio CD,The audio CD came packaged as seller claimed. CD was in perfect condition and arrived before I expected. I'm thankful I found it to add to my collection
3,Well... it's Boston,"The one thing that Tom Sholz suffered from over the course of these first three albums is that there seemed to be no 'growth', no progress.The songs are different, and yes, Amanda is great. But I want to see progress, movement forward, and that generally means the sonic signature of a writer, band, and production changes, particularly with so many years between them.But we are frozen in Sholz's laboratory and he has a process and method that works for him. Okay, fine. I'm okay with that, really.The songs are, as usual, hit and miss. After so many years, this album should have been filled with sure winners all the way around.Well, not everyone will agree. That's okay, too."
3,8 years for this.,"Not a bad record by Boston, but it took eight years for this? ""Amanda""#1 is just a poor single, don't even listen to it anymore. I still enjoy ""We're Ready"" #9 mainstream rock, ""I Think I Like It"", the melody is perfect, and the great ""Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)/Still In Love"" #20 on the 100. ""Cool The Engines"", hit #9 on the 100, but i've cooled of this tune over the years. Without Fran, Barry and Sib Boston was missing some key parts. ""Walk On"", came on in 1994, at the heighth of grunge."
4,A band that can put on the rock,Boston is lost in the rock shuffle now as they are not out touring like their past contemporaries and that is ok as with sounds like this it shows what rock should be.
5,Beautiful MFSL Treatment of a Perfect Album,"This review pertains to the MFSL CD of Third Stage. As of the date of this review, it is selling in used condition for $45 to $75. All I can say is I wouldn't sell mine for three times that.This classic work by a classic band is enhanced dramatically by the Mobile Fidelity treatment. From the opening guitar of ""Amanda"" to the closing strains of ""Holly Ann,"" this is an absolute study of how to engineer perfection.The music is the key, though, with Brad Delp never sounding better, and Tom Scholtz proving his genius again and again. If you don't own the MFSL version of this CD already, buy one today, because MFSL is gone, and these will never be made again."
5,Why Brad?,"The most remarkable, beautiful voice in rock music. This album is a gem. Amanda, We're Ready, and Cantcha Say are 3 of the most memorable songs of the 80's. There are no words to say......"
5,As good as it gets...,"3rd stage, the aptly named 3rd album from this great 70's rock band, is a journey rather than a series of songs. For this reason it is difficult to pick a favorite track. This compilation of material really needs to be listned to at one sitting, preferrably in the dark, to be appreciated. Every now and again you find a record that you love ALL of, and don't get sick of. This is one of those for me. The transitions between tracks and the works of the guitar hooks draws you into the chapter. If I was forced to pick my favs they would be the haunting Hollyann, the powerful Cool the Engines and We're Ready.Buy this album!"
4,Third Stage Is Worth Adding To The Ship,"... Third Stage is not their best (probably #3 of the first three with #1 being the best), but it is very good. Amanda and Hollyann are great ballads, We're Ready, The Launch, Cool The Engines and Can'tcha Say / Still In Love are great Boston Rock N Roll! I Think I Like It is also very good and My Destination is good. I could skip To Be A Man and A New World and not miss them.Advice for those new to Boston: Pick up this release and Boston's Greatest Hits and you'll have just about all the Boston you need. If you're a real Boston enthusiast, get all four of their five releases (skip ""Walk On"" - it is pretty lame)."
3,The sunset of AOR.,"Eight years in the making, and it started off with a ballad. Granted, that ballad was the soaring 'Amanda', yet Boston's male fans were probably jolted out of their recliners when they put this disc on their basement rack systems and sat back to await the magic. Overall this is a fine album, retaining the classic Boston sound from the mid-70's. 'Cool the Engines' is easily the best track, while side 2 features the late Brad Delp's epic multi-layered vocals on 'Cantcha Say'. A bit ballad-heavy as a whole, but still a fine example of late-period album-oriented rock."
3,Utterly Mediocre,"""Amanda,"" ""We're Ready"" and ""Cool the Engines"" are the only tracks that really did it for me. Everything else sounded like an overwrought ballad, a stunted rocker or frilly trifles. It just didn't do it for me. For Boston fans, it's essential because it has ""Amanda,"" but in terms of being a solid album, it just isn't. There's too much filler and mediocrity for this qualify as a must-buy for average Joe."
5,3rd Stage,What can i say other than a good album along with the first two. I saw them in concert back in the 70s (my 1st concert) and stood right in the front row near the speaker. My ears were still ringing the next day. LOL. Tom Scholz is/was a genius at creating a new sound for rock and roll. Brads voice was one of the best. Thanks Tom and Co. R.I.P. Brad.
5,Still Soaring,"Boston's third effort is solid. Just for the magnificent power ballad ""Hollyann"" this disc rates 5 stars. Actually this disc is a magnum opus of one power chord on top of another!!! Third Stage does not disappoint!! Just lay back,close your eyes,and turn it up."
3,Boston: Third Stage,"Tom Scholz's company, which manufactured the ""Rockman"", was a client of my ad agency. Besides designing the sales materials for their many various mobile audio and performance products, we aso did some a lot of promotion work for their rock group, ""Boston.""This particular album cover was put together by me, from an idea drawing provided by a fan of the group, with me as the Senior Art Director for the agency handling the project.The spaceship is, in reality, a top-down view of the organ in the Old North Church, in the city of Boston, with the ""Boston"" signature spacecraft in the area where the keyboard would normally be.You really had to be a die-hard ""Boston"" fan to really enjoy this album --which I wasn't. However, the vinyl album cover is still in my design portfolio."
2,Who's on third? Nobody,"As good as the first 2 were as in no bad songs,this one is hard to find one good one which is to bad. Gave it 2 stars because i like boston. Dont let your heart tell you its good,its not very."
1,drivel,"eight years in the garage to turn out this sludge? should have been thrown out with the old motor oil! Pain inducing drivel from the second worst band to ever hit it big.(top honors still go to Styx)As long as it took to make,you would think it would sound a little different from the first two records.Makes me nostalgic for Uriah Heep."
4,Great CD by a great band.,"This was the first I had heard of Boston and I likeed it. I am not a die hard fan but I know what I like.""Amanda"" is a great track, I can see why it was popular. I especially like ""We're ready"" I think the guitar solos are pretty good in that song. Maybe the guitar is not a strong as I have heard in some of their previous songs but it is still memorable. I think it is great how they use various guitars to mimic a shuttle taking off(it sounds fairly realistic.Overall: When a band spends 5 years to make a CD that is fairly short, then you know it will either be great or horrible. Either way you look at it, the band was satisfied with it and I think they satisfied their fans with this album. If you like Third Stage consider buying Boston's Greatest Hits for some more great sound."
4,Look here...don't look back at Don't Look Back,"Very good recovery after Don't Look Back, which was not nearly as good as the debut. Third Stage has many strong songs Amanda, The Launch/Cool The Engines, My Destination. And I Think I Like It thru Can't Ya Say/Still In Love, Holly Ann together are great and end the disc on a very high note."
5,"Unhipper than hell, but still rocks my world every time!","Nobody understands my obsession, but this is one amazing album. Just listen to ""Cantcha Say"" and prepare to be moved. Layers of guitar harmonies just take you to a new level. Forget about My Bloody Valentine, forget Pet Sounds, and forget anything else you've ever heard before. This album just can't be topped."
2,Plant Layout and Flow Improvement,Save your money for a good book on Flow Improvement Through Lean Principles and Value Stream Mapping.
4,Great Resource!,"This book has been a great addition to my stormwater library. It is well written, concise and easy to understand. The software provided with text is also a great bonus!"
4,The book most borrowed.,"This is the book I can't keep on my shelf. It is clear, concise, and practical, but watch out it has a tendency to disappear when your not looking. Our storm sewer designers really like it."
3,An excellent compilation on stormwater state of the industry,"Haestad Methods has undoubtedly assembled an expert team of stormwater professionals. The subject matter spans two primary areas-- hydraulics and hydrological principles, and stormwater system design. In all cases, the explanations are succinct and adequate, and in some cases the authors should be commended for the impact and economy of the few paragraphs devoted to the particular topic at hand. Such economy should be expected of a compilation of such ambitious breadth, one intended as a reference book and review of the present state of the industry. For the industry leader in hydraulic modeling and analysis, however, the book falls short in bridging the span between system analysis and system design. Haestad's next release should dedicate more space to how its modeling software--StormCAD, PondPack and the others--fit into the stormwater system evaluation and design process."
4,Good Basics for Design,This book has allowed our Jr. Engineers to see the whole picture and is a good review for those of us who have been out of the loop for a while.
5,One-Stop Stormwater Reference,"This manual covers it all in clear easy to understand examples. If you only have room for one reference manual, this is it."
3,Pulls together many sources,"Much of my library consists of specialized topic books. I often have a desktop covered with texts. Lately I find fewer books on my desk at quitting time. This book covers the same topics, but in a manner that is practical, where practical is needed, and theoretical where needed. Explanations are readable and concise.Very useful for practicing engineers."
4,reference book for storm water engineers,"Cover all aspects of storm water modeling, very good for practicing engineers in water resources, in order to be well informed how to model and design the storm water systems, I use it as a reference book and a design tool for every day topic or task. It is easy to follow and to apply in practice."
1,and we call this writing?,"ok, so this book was kind of ok...if you're just looking for a bunch of sex connected by something kind of resembling a story line. give me a break! was this book anything like real life? NO! did any of the relationships resemble mature, adult relationships? NO! unless you're talking about the kinds of ""relationships"" that exist in middle school and throughout most of high school. were the characters believable? NO! it was as if a bunch of kids were playing adults. the men were all morons and the women were a pack of whores (asha and angie cheated just as badly as faith!). i didn't like any of the characters, i didn't sympathize with any of the characters, i didn't respect any of them! this book is a horrible excuse for ""serious"" writing and the author is utterly overrated and, if you were to judge by this novel, completely without talent (i wrote more realistic stories when i was twelve!). i would give this book no stars, but, unfortunately, that's not possible!"
4,Weird...,"I won't lie to you and tell you that I liked this book all the way through and everything was peachy. I learned a couple things about myself while reading this book. For example, for a minute, I thought I was a little homophobic. But it was weird because I didn't feel this way when I read E. Lynn Harris' books. It was wild to me to read about two lesbians try to find love because I had never read it before and being a heterosexual woman, it went over my head at first. But then I blew the chip off my shoulder and read the doggone book and I liked it. There were mixed feelings of pity, delight, comfort, curiosity, and disgust but many more where I laughed out loud (Big Les was totally vivid) and I have to give credit where credit is due. This book was controversial, organized, and the end was uncomfortably realistic. Read it."
3,good read,"Jayson is deeply in love with Faith and he proves it at the end of the novel, even though she cheated on him. I thought he was very foolish for staying with her, but in his eyes he did the right thing. Asha, Jayson's best firned came to terms with herself and she did what she wanted. Love Frustration was a good novel."
4,Good Book,"Although this is not one of my favorite books, it is a wonderful read. The plot will keep you guessing and page turning until the end. Great Job Mr. Johnson"
2,Unrealistic,"This book was sort of a disappointment to me based on the other books that I have read by the author. The storyline was very unrealistic. There is no way that the book should've ended the way it did with Jayson and Faith's relationship. If so, Jayson is very weak. I really didnt enjoy it, but I love the author so maybe the next book I read from him will be better!"
3,Good Read but not the best,"This is the 1st book I've read by this author. It was definitely entertaining and held my attention. I didn't enjoy the ending but I guess it was realistic considering the emotions involved in the complex relationships the author takes you through. Asha and Jayson are well developed characters but the author leaves you wanting to know more about Jayson's past to better understand why his self esteem was so low. The character Faith needs to be better developed because there is relatively no background development for her. This book leaves the doors wide open for a sequel which I'm sure Johnsom MUST have in the works. Overall, I'd recommend the book to friends for a entertaining read."
2,Poor gameplay,"I'm having trouble at the very beginning of the game, and I've solved some hard games. This certainly is not going to be fun for my son.Also, the gameplay is terrible. The camera angles are very limited. You can't even look up. The left-right movement is twitchy, it makes it hard to do a double-jump straight ahead."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air in the age of bling bling and bootie,"As a follower of female MCs, I was really looking forward to this album. While I didn't know much about Ms. Toi, her reputation preceeded her. When this disk came out, I quickly snatched it up and wasn't disappointed. In this age, when so many female rappers choose to use their bodies and explicit content to sell albums, it's refreshing to see another female MC that actually carries herself like a lady. While it took a while for me to get used to her West Side flow, I quickly became impressed by her content and beats. Some of the better gems from this album include the catchy ""Handclap"" (which I guarantee will have you singing the chorus after a listen or two), ""Love Me or Leave Me"", and ""Work a Twist"". I predict that people are going to sleep on Ms. Toi and that's a shame. It's so seldom that we see a female MC that is both classy and talented."
1,Stop Playing with Me,"Ms Toi is attractive and sings but what would make you want to rap. Her doing a rap album is stupid. This sounds like a 92 album and maybe then it would work but not now. Not with Jadakiss,Lox,Mobb Deep, Jay-z,Ras Kass,Cormega,Nas, Foxy, Remi,Rah and eve and others spittin the way They do. West coast gangster rap is shaky and for a female like her it is shakier. With appearances by Ice Cube on ""My Dogs and Locs"", MC Ren on ""Bangin"",Nelly and ST Lunatics on the childish ""Be Like Me"" and e40 on ""Work a Twist"" this album is garbage. She got songs on there like she is the queen gangster ... she can't sound hard or even represent even with the hard voice. This album is weak. The beats are so,so. Pick up Foxy Brown's ""Broken Silence"" if you just want to hear a female rapper. This album is down there with Angie Martinez, Amil and Queen Pen, so if you like those weak albums. then you love this garbage. One. peace"

2,"A favorite movie, terrible DVD transfer","""Q Planes"" is one of my pet movies, so I was very excited to see it available on DVD at last. When it arrived I was a bit apprehensive, though, because the packaging looked rather amateurish. Watching the DVD, my apprehension proved to be justified, as the transfer is of very poor quality, with constant pixilation, slowing and pausing of the image, jumping ahead to later chapters, and even stopping altogether when one of the cartoons on the same DVD begins playing. It appears to be a DVD transfer of a video tape of a decent enough print, but it's unplayable--and given the amateurish packaging, I suspect it's not just my copy. Very disappointing."
2,Bret/Owen is clipped,I picked up this tape hoping to see the Bret/Owen cage match in full. This turned out to be wishful thinking. Apparently it was more important to see Lex Luger standing around with his hands on his hips yelling at Adam Bomb. You'll have to either bite the bullet and pay for Summerslam '94 or pick up this match on a comp tape somewhere.
1,Book not stand alone,"I purchased the Kindle version of the book, thinking that if it was offered sans CD, the book must be a stand-alone product. Wrong! I'm half-way through, and it's abundantly clear that the book should never have been offered in any version without the CD."
4,Easy to read and valuable,"This is a book I would reccomend to everybody who are interested in meditation and past lives regression. Short, easy to read, summarizes very well Dr's Weiss mind set."
3,An intro to past live regression,"I bought this book because a friend attended one of Brian Weiss' workshops where they did a powerful past life regression. I thought this book and CD would be comparable to it. It wasn't. The CD is short and is very rushed. Every time I do the CD, I never feel like I have enough time. I feel like I am being yanked away right when I am starting to gain something.The book is quite short too. The pages are beautiful and relaxing. Its a good read and very helpful."
4,great cd,"I use the CD everyday and it has helped me learn a lot. If you're new to self-hypnosis, this is a great starting point. And if you're not, this is great place to learn a past-life regression technique. Brian Weiss seemed to have put a bit of extra fluff in this one, but over-all I like it."
3,Missing CD,"Bought this book back in Oct. 2011 and hadn't had a chance to read it yet. Now, I find that the CD is missing, so the product becomes useless."
