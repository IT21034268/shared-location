3,A half empty glass!,"Canin does little to renew this already old story theme. I found the story to be captivating though. The problem lies not in the story per se, but in Mr.Canin's forceful use of language. Much is written with little effect on the bottom-line image the reader gets."
3,"i just finished what i thought was a quick, gripping read...","only to close the book think about it and relize it wasnt even that special...funny how i wanted to like it better but cant. i have read his others, this tries to build charators that arent rich enough..."
2,"What an irritating, banal, self-satisfied little book!","This is the story of Orno, who goes to college, dentistry school, marries his smarter, more interesting friend's sister and has a baby. I started thinking about that name ""Orno."" Is Canin slyly signalling to us that he agrees with us that his protagonist is a zero first and last? I wish I believed he were that subtle. (Although Dr. Canin certainly doesn't go to great lengths to hide his contempt for dentists.) The characters are two-dimensional, great swathes of the plot are boring, and all of it is derivative of the work of better writers. The real conflict is between Marshall (""Martial,"" get it?) and his father. The problem is they're off-screen most of the time, and we have to see everything through Orno's infuriatingly dim eyes. Skip this book, and read ""A Secret History"" instead. Same plot, much better written."
3,Ramblin...,"I liked the book but I didn't love it and wouldn't tell people to run out and buy it, nor would I pass it along now that I own it. I grew to like the main characters enough that I couldn't wait to finish the book. But I ended up feeling somewhat cheated because I wasn't really impacted by any part of it enough to have made it worth my time. Towards the end of the book the story seemed mundane and like typical every day life. Nothing to write a book about. On a final and unrelated note, from the picture on the back of the book, I think the author is a hotty!"
4,max graham is not john graham,"good mix. nothing super extraordinary, but nothing went horribly wrong either.""quivver"" is the alias of john graham, a previous member of tilt. max graham compiled transport 4, which is not dark like quivver's transport 5, but progressive (leaning towards trance). i personally liked transport 4 better than this compilation, but no surprises here."
4,Could have been better...,"If you compare this CD with Transport 4, you might be a little disappointed because it's not as progressive or intense. But if you listen to this mix on its own, you will enjoy it quit a bit. This CD starts off with a disco feel to it, which is similar to Pete Tong's Essential Mix works, which is not my cup of tea but it picks up soon after that. Before you know it though, the CD winds down and leaves you wanting a little bit more. I would have liked a 2-CD set. Overall, not bad... uptempo and energetic for the most part...then it's over before you know it. Darn!"
1,obvious,"looking for a science book similar to ""the next fifty years"" by john brockman and twenty five other scientists. i camw to this and have not read it. by reading the description it should be clear that no-one should."
2,Unfortunate,"This book is nothing like a comprehensive biography of Harvey. The authors don't mention any of his television work, only a few stage plays, and an incomplete list of his films. The text is mostly trivial and anecdotal, and biased against this really wonderful actor."
1,Mean Spirited,"I have been a fan of Laurence Harvey since I was eleven years old. I am now 52. I have heard all the ""gay"" rumors, all the ""he uses women"" as well as ""he always goes for older, rich, slim women, etc"". But this book is a ugly, mean spirited attack on a dead man. I find it odd that the author waited until Harvey's death (in fact many of the quoted people are dead as well). I purchased this book and put it in the trash. I didn't even donate it because it was so hateful."
2,Not very enjoyable,"It's unauthorized! And here's how that translates on this video: There is absolutely NO Beastie Boys music in the documentary and NO footage of the Beastie Boys, with the exception of a few stock clips that were released to the general public. Also, because it's unauthorized, there really aren't any interviews with anyone who was close to the Beasties, again with one exception, DJ Hurricane. The interviews are limited to about four people: DJ Hurricane, a Rolling Stone reporter, the producers of the ""Fight For Your Right"" video, and a band member from one of Mike D's first bands. That's it.It's actually pretty thin on material and I didn't really learn anything terribly interesting about the band. As a huge Beastie Boys fan, I was disappointed with this one."
4,Love the Look of this Pendant Light,"I am very happy with the size and look of this pendant light. It is hanging over the table in our dinette. The one thing I would consider a negative is the quality of the metal(made in China). When my husband squeezed one of the links in the chain to close it up, it broke and the light crashed to the table. Fortunately he hadn't attached the glass globe yet. The metal ""arms"" that float over the globe are different heights from the glass. The ""nut"" that attaches the ceiling cover over the electrical box is of poor quality, ruff edges and difficult to get the threads to screw on. Three 40W bulbs give a gracious amount of light. 60W is too much."
5,Steaming,"This and a lid will transform any wok into a huge steamer, large enough to steam lobsters and Dungeness crabs, for example. It's inexpensive, well made, and exactly fulfills its purpose. The supplier was more than forthcoming and helpful. Delivery and packing were of the first order."
3,"It's good, but","This steamer works well, but it's hard to remove small-cut vegetables/items from it since there's no handle. The steamer has a tendency to shift if you try and use a spoon or even tongs to remove the items and I don't want everything getting wet in the 1,000 degree water below especially my hands. It's very durable and will last a lifetime. I may ""mickey mouse"" a handle or a chain to make my life easier. Have a nice day."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"Received steamer in an unpadded plain usps ennvelope which resulted it being bent in half with one edge crimped. Does not sit tight in wok. My husband offered to get his needle nose pliers to fix. also, photo shows steamer sitting in a wok but i thought the photo showed the steamer only which has convenient handles and a generous 2"" edge. I was going to use with my bamboo steamer but now reluctant to use even to steam vegetables since it does not sit tight inside wok to the edge therefore releasing indirect steam not even on cooking surface. I received a very flimsy punch-holed piece of aluminum that i would never have paid any amount of money for. My husband could make one better."
5,Funny and touching,Another win for MC Beaton. A humerous take on ladies who had to fend for themselves-plus an interesting history lesson on the culture of the Regency.
2,Not the best Marion Chesney,"I love Marion Chesney books. I have found them entertaining, they are a quick read and I can count on them. They are chessy- the formula is boy meets girl, one is in love with someone else, there is a threat on there life, someone dies, they end up together and they love happily ever after. Like Barbara Cartland without the extra trim. However, I couldn't read this one- I stopped after the second chapter."
4,what you waiting for...,love this song and video but unfortunately this cd doesn't include the Felix Da Housecat Rude Ho Mix.
2,Sensual?...Dull and Basic is more like it!!,"I saw this book paired with some massage oil on another website, so I thought I could buy the book and do the same to create a romantic gift. This book is far from sensual. It is a basic technique book with little romance involved. This book is good if you want to a basic full body message technique, but the title is misleading. For a more romantic book, look elsewhere!"
2,Pic doesn't match real product,"I bought this as a gift for my mom who looooves this fragrance, but when it arrived, SURPRISE, it's a cream. We, men, are not supposed to know what is a BODY LOTION, according to the picture, it is a perfume. Please fix this, anyone. Thanks."
4,a Keeper,"This book has earned a place in my ""keepers"" folder on my kindle. I will definately revisit it and reread it in the future. I love that this book was written over 100 years ago. I love that it reads in itself like a prayer. I love its simplicity, and its honesty.I would highly recommend it for anyone who might find the title interesting. It is free on kindle, and well worth the read if books of this type interest you."
4,LORD TEACH ME TO PRAY,One of the things we all need to do is learn to pray. This book is good for not only reading but memorizing scriptures
4,Great Book on Prayer,"This is a good book that helps you understand the words spoken in the Lord's prayer. Many times I say this prayer on my own and in meetings however, after reading this book it gives new meaning. Who better to learn how to pray then from the Master, Our Lord, and a man of prayer Andrew Murray. Thanks!"
3,Very deep,"I found this book too deep for me, and although I am a Christian, I fould it hard to relate to"
5,"LORD,TEACH US TO PRAY BY ANDREW MURRAY","I find this book very helpful, and knowledgeable,it gave me insight into the dept of pray.on how to enter into.and how to get the most out praying to the father. To build a relationship that is solid and lasting. A lasting foundation."
4,Great short work on prayer,I just got done reading this on my Kindle. Do not think of it as an exhaustive work on prayer but rather a short work of about 50 pages that looks at some of the things Jesus says about prayer. Murray is very readable considering when this was written. Worth reading. Free!Sent from my Kindle Touch
4,Well worth reading.,God's word never changes and is forever relevant. Easy to read even though it was written at least one hundred years ago. This was my first Andrew Murray book. I give it 4 stars.
3,It's okay,"I thought this book would be a 21st Century read, but it is written and reads like the King James Bible. Needs to be updated in current language and topics!"
4,Classic must read,"Written in an older English style, I found I enjoyed the encouragement and earnestness of the author.This book can be read many times always gleaning more."
3,A Prayer's Lesson,This book gave me a different perspective into how prayer should be approached and why we as Christians should pray.I like the method used to breakdown each line of The Lord's Prayer. This book also gave me a more depth insight of how to strengthen my own prayer time with the Holy Spirit.I would suggest this reading to fellow Christians who are looking to strengthen their ministry of prayer.
3,Praying,"If you ever wondered if you were praying right, this book will let you know. This book has verified the closeness of the father in prayer and the necessity of praying without ceasing."
5,enlightening,"it was very inspirational, kept my faith up and helps me in my times of need,definately recommended for everyone,any creed or race"
3,Pretty good,The book is quick and to the point. Could elaborate more in some areas. It was still worth the read.
2,Somewhat confusing,Very short book. A little confusing; but what I did grasp was very insightful. I did get that you need to choose a place that is just for you and thy Father to pray.
5,Must read,"Very informative, great for people learning how and what prayers can do for them and teaches what we should be praying for... completely inspired by Jesus's words... loved it"
5,Learning to pray,information is very easy to follow. Takes you on a step by step explanation about Jesus's advice to the Disciples on how to pray.Very easy read.
5,Teaching tool on prayer,A small but powerful book! The perfect prayer given by Jesus in the book of Matthew masterfully brought to reverence.
2,Repetitive and poorly written,I was extremely disappointed with this ebook. You will be too. It was repetitive in content and the grammar was atrocious!
2,Bad formatting on free version,I downloaded the free version and the formatting is very poor. I don't understand why there is no table of contents.
2,Two stars,Good and needed more facts. It could be more related to today's world more. More on how to pray in this present society.
3,lord teach us to pray,"I was disappointed. the first of it went on and on lord teach us to pray, I never finished the rest of it.I guess it is just one long prayer. maybe I am too impatient. I am a get to the point kind of person. I am sure there are persons out there who would really like it and benefit from it.How to Be a Good Wife: Secrets for a Happy MarriageAll About Wheatgrass. How to Use, Juice and Grow Wheatgrass.Unique DIY Centerpiece Ideas with Wheat Grass"
4,Teach us to pray,"Was easy to download, good price, and is very interesting to hear what he has to say. I am enjoying it."
1,What Threat?,"I did not like this book.I found it typical of most books that are written by cops who use self appointed experts such as the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center as their only sources of information(hardly unbiased sources of info. on the subject).Mr.Snow also injects his own opinion into the book on several occasions(the Government is always right,only the police should own guns,blah,blah,blah)Nor does he offer any insight into why people join these groups such as Waco,Ruby Ridge and I.R.S abuses(all confirmed by Senate hearings).The reader would be better served by reading""American Extremists""by Laird Wilcon/Kerry Noble to get a more accurate account on the subject."
3,From the Back Cover of the 1975 Edition,"The Divine Yes -- the living legacy of Dr. E. Stanley Jones, one of the world's best-known and most respected evangelists. Written in the fourteen-month period between a crippling stroke and his death, it is the personal record of Dr. Jones' struggle with physical limitations and his inspiring spiritual victories. It is, most of all, the story of God's power to use all things for the good of those who love him.""I have often said half jokingly that when I get to heaven, I will ask for twenty-four hours to see my friends, and then I shall go up to Him and say, 'Haven't you a world somewhere which has fallen people who need an evangelist like me? Please sen me there.' For I know no heaven beyond preaching the Gospel to people. That is heaven to me. It has been, is, and ever shall be."" -- December, 1972, Sat Tal, India."
5,Awesome music!,"This is one of my favorite CD's, he has such a smooth, quality voice that is perfect for a laid back, mellow day. Whenever we're looking for something calming to listen to, this is the first one we put in. Great stuff Matt!"
1,This book was a disappointment.,"This book would have been great if the author had bothered to show both the capital and lower case letters for each letter style. Instead you get either or. For example, you only get Roman capitals, no lower case. For Celtic, Gothic, Italic, etc. you are only shown lower case letters of these styles. HELLO, if someone is trying to learn a letter style, they need to see both capitals and lowers case letters for that style."
1,It was bad,First off I only got the little green plastic tool which was flimsy and it quickly wore down. I didn't get the screw driver. Not worth it...
4,Satisfied,I am not a tech savy guy but replacing the screen was cheap and not to terriblely hard to do. Any video you watch will under estimate the difficultly of spliting your ipod. I received the screen in great condiction and in the time estimated. I would recommend this seller.
4,Satisfactory overall,"I wish I would have bought this screen and replaced the broken factory LCD a long time ago. It showed up super quick, much faster than I expected. Installation wasn't bad, there are plenty of instructions to do the installation located online. After a few weeks I have one bad pixel in the screen, but given the cost and how fast the screen got there I can't complain a whole lot. Will be buying from them again next time I break a screen."
2,Not new like was advertised.,"When I opened the package that was sent to me in the mail, the screen had a few scuff marks on it and once installed the colors where all messed up. Getting the package and all that was really easy but the product was not new like advertised."
4,Extremely fast shipping,"I ordered this on Friday and received it Monday. This was with regular shipping, not the upgraded options. The screen is a perfect match for the 5th gen iPod and the tools are helpful in opening the device. The only problem I have is that the screwdriver provided doesn't fit the screws on the inside side of the faceplate. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
3,Only 1 problem.,"I ordered this LCD for a friend when I accidentally broke hers. When it arrived it looked easy to install, and other than taking apart the iPod, it was. The only problem I have with this product is that the display is all purple and green. There are no loose connections, and the screen is the proper size and fit. No idea what happened, it must be a faulty screen."
3,Good screen but poor quality tools,"The screen that came with my order is pretty decent and works well, however I can't tell the same thing for the easy opening tools. The tools are made of cheap plastic and they warped and broke as I tried to open my iPod. I ended up using a screwdriver and the guitar pick kind of thing that comes with the tools to open the iPod. 3 stars is because of useless plastic tools and lack of instructions."
3,"Great screen, but did not come with instructions.","Granted, its easy enough to find replacement instructions online, I just feel that if an item is in the product's description, it should be included in the received product. Watched a couple how-to videos on youtube and installation went great. Screen is good, very bright; however it had one dead pixel on arrival."
4,IPOD Replacement Screen,"Ordered this part from Amazon.com so I could replace my own screen. I received the part in less than 3 days. I thought I would be waiting the full 7 days! It was a nice surprise to actually get something I ordered online without any problems, let alone sooner than expected. Great first experience!"
2,Damaged screen,"I ordered a replacement screen for my ipod 30GB 5th Gen, and it arrived with a huge crack in the bottom of the screen. The bad part is that the packaging looked fine. It was in a nice sturdy cardboard box (no bubble wrap or peanuts however), and they did a decent job....except for the fact that no where on the package did they mark ""fragile""!! Its an LCD screen! Those things are kinda fragile dont you think? So I'm guessing since no one knew it was fragile, it probably got chunked around during sorting and shipping. Thanks New Harbor, or amazon or whoever packaged my item."
4,not so good on the time of shipping,"it took a little longer i thought it would never came but it works perfectly no question about it i fix it now its like new. Some other people toll me it was gonna cost a lot of money. well it did, but it was worth it."
3,Not a bad exchange,Product came just as was picture with the exception of the missing tool. In the picture it shows two tools. Only one was received. Other than that the product was great. The screen was in VERY good condition. Brand new even. Just short one tool.
5,How great is this thing,Screen is perfect. Very bright and easy to read. A little tool kit came in the mailer. You need it to get into an IPOD and complete the fix. I would encourage watching a video on YouTube a few times before you complete your fix. It helped me make sure I knew what I was doing.
4,"Work great, crappy tools!!!","I got it rather quickly via USPS first class mail. No anti-static bags just a plain electronics bag, guess I don't have to worry too much about ESD while working on this.My iPod 5G's screen started to experience horizontal dead pixels or something so I checked this out on the ol' Amazon. The tools are really something to be desired, they are FLIMSY. Tried the first green plastic tool to dislodge the clips and the blade had worn out on the first run. Same thing with the second one, ended up using a small flat-head screwdriver and took my time.Overall it was super simple to disassemble and the screen was a snap to install. There was an issue with the ribbon cable management and the HDD but just did a work around. Turned it on and it was like brand new!!!My major gripe is with the tools they send with the screen, they are worthless!!! The screen is just like the original, great brightness, color and fit."
4,I liked it.,"This book is not natural history, but a story the struggle of individual orchid lovers and growers against the surprising dishonesty, callousness, and self-serving behavior of top institutions and eco-bureaucrats. Well-written."
5,Botanical Cravings,"Orchid Fever reinvents horticultural non-fiction with its sensual imagery and thrilling accounts of real-life adventures in the mad, mad world of orchid fanaticism. From the very first sentence, I was hooked and could hardly stand to put this book down until I had found out what exactly was meant by each of the tantalizing chapter names. Hansen has a way of bringing surprising sex appeal and glamour to a subject that most would have treated with far less inspiration."
4,Woulda been 5 but it was too short.,"It has taken me 10 years, but I am now able to buy an orchid plant at Long's, care for it, repot it, and have it bloom more than once under my control and responsibility. I am that much an amateur orchid enthusiast, no foreign travel, no cloning, no $1000 species for me. Certainly no show winners. But orchids thrill me. I have 14 plants (I just bought another one: dayglo green with fuscia petals)all of which are in rather good health. Some have little nubs of flower stems on them.This wonderful book has inspired me. It has entertained me, and made me laugh too (""What's dog food?""). I have learned so much, and I now feel the depth and tradition and botanical (cellular, even) heritage that motivates and directs the DNA, hypothalamus, and higher-functioning regions of the brain of the orchid-lover. This book and its stories have added a romance and knowledge to my love and care of my plants."
4,A RARE HERMAPHRODITIC TALE,"The name said it all. ""Orchid Fever: A Horticultural Tale of Love, Lust, and Lunacy"" is one multi-faced novel which most readers would either cherish or dislike. Its pattern is dynamic: the initial momentum was sustained till the very end.The 272 pages that constituted this true story explored the strange world of orchids using men and women as its horticultural tools. It is one ominous tale that is rich in humour.This story has a hermaphroditic outlook. It shuffles between a crime thriller and a love story. It is well-written, and very captivating."
3,Less than expected,"I read a large segment of this book while stranded in the English Channel but found myself somewhat disinterested in the content which seemed to have an overwhelming focus on the regulations involving orchids. I was expecting a bit more of the focus to be on the amalgamation of people and their orchids but felt that overall, this book came up short in that department. I was spoiled by the first chapter ""Journey to Fire Mountain"" and hoped the following chapters would be similar; however, the emphasis gradually drifted away from becoming more acquainted with the fascinating people and their orchids and more to the more bureaucratic aspect. I recommend The Botany of Desire by Michael Pollan for additional reading or as an alternative."
1,neither entertaining nor informative,"I have in general been a great fan of Hansen's, and his book in particular about Borneo was a jewel. ""Orchid Fever"" trivializes almost every issue and individual that it touches. It is also extremely unpleasant to read if you dislike (as I do) the snide tone that it frequently employs as a substitute for humor. This is one of the most irritating books I have read in a long time."
3,Goes from being fantastic to childishly stupid.,"This six part BBC miniseries that has not been officially released stars Robson Green as the widowed father of a teenage daughter and a younger son. Struggling with the loss of his wife Bethany, George works in a chocolate factory while pursuing his passion to build a rocket to send Bethany's ashes into space. This story was both poignant and hilariously funny at other times. Unfortunately after being absolutely brilliant for the first three episodes it seemed to lose direction some way into the fourth and had become marred with some stupid childish scenes to continue to a disappointing and less than worthy ending.I had previously written a greatly favourable five star reveiw based on the two first episodes and had not seen the entire mini series until just recently. What happened to turn what was A+++ into a B minus second half?"
5,Reviewed Book,"The first book received was inadequate. It had blank or missing pages, the replacement book was just fine and in good shape. Apparently a problem with the publishers!"
5,"Concise, Readable, and Scholarly Overview of John","Encountering John is an outstanding college level volume on the fourth Gospel. The book is Evangelical, conservative and scholarly. I found it comprehensive in scope, while concise in content. Kostenberger occasionally presents his personal bias but always supports his views with reasonable arguments. Each chapter includes an outline, objectives, key words, interesting vignettes, and study questions. I would highly recommend the book to the serious student looking for a concise and readable overview of John's Gospel."
5,Save That Tiger! Ecology in India ---,"This fascinating book is primarily a message of conservation, of the importance of saving the large predators for the environmental health of the planet. Arjan Singh was recognized internationally as one of India's major conservationists. He maintained a farm in Uttar Pradesh called Tiger Haven, where he successfully raised big cats and returned them to the wild. The first section of the book is autobiographical, telling the story of Singh's evolution from a sport hunter to a conservationist. Following this, he refutes an entire gamut of misconceptions concerning the great predators, which have been used to justify the wanton destruction of the big cats, particularly the tiger. He illustrates his arguments with case histories of some tigers he has known; animals that took to hunting humans only under extreme pressure and entirely because of human interference in tiger habitats. Very entertaining as well as thought provoking!"
4,"""A Tempting Book""",This was a interesting novel I enjoyed reading it. I liked the characters and the storyline was fun. The chemistry between Noelle and Trent was hot. What's next Ms. Hill?
5,Delicious,"This product is worth every penny. It tastes good on everything, and makes everything taste better. Its like bacon. (Not bacon flavored just making a comparison of excellence)"
5,Dave's Hurtin Habanero Mustard Is Awesome,This stuff is so good its practicly addictive! Awesome on brautworsts! You have to try this!!!
4,Perfect Blend of sweet and spicy,"Good balance of tangy mustard, slow heat from the pepper, and a mild sweetness that ties it all together"
5,Finally! All the different mixes on one CD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Finally! All the different ""Perfect"" mixes are put on one CD... Thank God! This CD puts the various mixes (6 in all) together from different releases around the world (the US, Australia, the UK...), plus a couple new ones. You get:1. Perfect (album version) 3:232. Nellee Hooper Mix 4:143. Nellee Hooper Instrumental 4:124. Perfecto Mix 7:005. Electro Breakbeat Mix 6:026. Perfect Dub 7:04Rather than track all these excellent mixes down around the world as they appear on various singles, etc., this is ""the one"" release which gives you everything about ""Perfect"" on one disk...perfect!!! If you are tired of buying 2 or 3 (or 4) releases to get the different mixes, this CD is for you. I love it! Thank you Smashing Pumpkins for thinking of us."
3,I'm with this guy Help them and DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"I got this cd at the music store in the mall for a high price. They said it was VHTF and that was why i bought it. Now look at this there will be 1000's of them produced! All the management wants to do is make fans think that the cd they are buying is rare, then after all the poor suckers buy it at the high price they produce about 6 million copies so that they can get more and more and more money from the fans (what im saying is that the fans that get it when it is supposedly ""RARE"" is gettin screwed) So Help Them And DONT Buy This CD."
3,sterling silver flat chain bracelet,While the sterling silver is very bright and looks well made it would not take much to break it because it is so thin. I was going to give it as a present but worried if my friend wore it once it would break. The price was good but the product was to delicate.
1,Dry and uninspired,"Not an enjoyable thing to listen to. My old harpsichord teacher had me buy Metzger's book ""Harpsichord: A Guide to Expressivity,"" and this CD came free with it. It fits nicely into that category of recordings in non-reverberant spaces with music that just sort of drones on."
5,Girlfriend is happy,"Burt's Bees is my girlfriend's favorite product line of lotions. Some of this stuff is getting harder to find, so we lucked-out to find this kit at such a good price. If she is happy, then I'm happy."
4,One of the best Alt-Country Cd's I've heard but...,"But... I wish it wasn't so directly influenced by Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt, etc. Though, I love those bands and many of their hybrids. I think this band is obviously as good and talented as any of them and deserve the equal success. Maybe on their upcoming new CD they won't be as direct with the influences. Otherwise, this is the best Alt-Country CD I've heard since the 1st time I heard Anodyne (See Uncle Tupelo) or Trace (See Son Volt)"
5,Hands Down the Best RTS ever made on Console!! Believe it!!,Any one that has ever played an RTS title on a console know they SUCK!! They Just do. This is the first RTS title that really works and its a Blast. Direct control over clans and Titans is just Freakn Cool and takes you all the way into the world unlike any RTS title has ever done.Has all the high action of a Console game with cool strategy elements. Highly recomended!! Five Stars!!
5,Goblin Commander,"This PS2 game is one of the best RTS games I have ever played! The graphics, sound, and gameplay in 'Goblin Commander' are awsome! This game is very addictive and fun because you go around killing other enemy goblins and destroy enemy territory cammanding an army of your very own goblins and titans. I highly recommend that you buy 'Goblin Commander' for the PS2! Another game which I highly recommend you buy for the PS2 is 'Giants: Citizen Kabuto'. It is also a great game and, in my opinion, it is a little better than Goblin Commander.Rating ('Goblin Commander'): 5/5"
5,This game ROCKS!!!,"This game is awesome!!!!! It is a lot of fun for people that like GREAT games, let alone RTS games. There hasn't been anything like this before that I've played, cuz all the other RTS games on the PS2 have been weakass. This is the game you want to be playing, want to be asking your mother for, or using your gift certificates on....then you can play it lots, get good at it, then come over to my house and I will skool you in multiplayer.Hah ha, take it!"
4,An RTS is....,"An RTS is a game in which you (the gamer) control a whole army or civilization and attempt to make it more powerful than the other peoples. The Sims may also be considered to be a RTS and some people even consider the zelda games ""ocarina of time"", ""majora's mask"", and ""wind waker"" to be RTS games since they all have their own clock systems."
2,DON'T BUY IT!!!,The campage in this game isn't fun at all. I found the Skirmish a little fun but not near as fun as Age Of Mythology. I also found that you can't play more then 1 titan at a time what's up with that!!! Overall do not buy it!!!!
1,Goblin Commander,Don't know how this game is my 7 year and son and I have not recieved it yet. It's been almost 2 months.
4,THE GAME of the consoles - GOBLIN COMMANDER UNLEASH TE HORDE,"I think this is the best game i ever have played.I have more than 50 PS2 games, but this is the best of all thegames i ever had played.This is a super-RTS game.This is a recommend game.When i am playing this game i just can't stop.THIS IS THE BEST F*****G GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!buy it, JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
5,new old blues,if you like the old blues guitar style you will like kenny.gets better everytime I hear it. great recording
5,"Funny and dark, well written and sick.","David Martin is a creative story-teller with a soulful and a sick, vivid imagination. He's got a way with words and has come up with another unpredictable storyline. A master of suspense, he opens the story with an intruder in the house and let's you know the married couple are doomed in the first couple of pages. Yet, the chapter is filled with suspense. Afterwards, everytime a chapter ends or starts with ""Tap Tap,"" the reader holds on tight, knowing something horrible is about to happen. But you read on. You have to! Hollywood, instead of filming re-makes, should turn this book -- and others by Martin -- into movies ASAP."
3,Very Gory Book,"This book was very gory and sick. I for one would not want to see it as a movie. It is too bloody and gory. It is hard to put down however, but as I read it, I kept asking myself, why I was reading it? I like thrillers but this one is just too graphic for me. It didn't scare me. I guess I don't understand how anyone could come up with such gross senarios. Don't read this if you have a queasy stomach!!"
1,Unbelievable,"This book was unbelievably gory and nauseated me beyond words. However, the biggest disappointment was the ending. I would rather Marianne have been killed than for her to end up a vampire. I doubt I would ever read this author's works again."
2,"Dumb!, Dumb!","Below Par on every level, bad writing, a good plot idea immaturley executed, reminded me of a high school creative writing student but only mildly better. Might appeal to people with an IQ of 70 on a warm day. Try Brian Hodge or Matthew J. Costello Instead, they are far superior."
3,Different,"I can taste a little bit of Chrysanthemum, but there is something else in it as well that I don't like it. It's not horrible, but it's not what I expected from the ones in restaurant."
1,not so sure,"when i opened this, it smelled like fish. i thought it might be the tin, so i brewed a cup to check. it reeked of fish even more, then. had to return....gotta love amazon...."
2,"Dell AC Adapter Worked, But With Problem","Adapter received on a timely basis. Did not work immediately. Worked intermittently. Appeared to be a problem with the AC power cord, possibly a broken wire. Fortunately, I had a spare power cord. With power cord replaced, adapter worked fine and is still working.Good value."
1,PA-9 Family 6G356,Make sure you have the correct plug identified before you order. I just opened the box I recieved a couple of days ago from siriustrading and it looks like I may have a paperweight because I'm beyond their 7 days from purchase time frame for returns.....I'll try checking with them....
3,Essentials for Psychological Assessment,Book was a good price.Condition much less than advertised.Book splitting at the spine. I had to do alot of scotch taping to keep pages in book.Thanks anyway!
5,Essential Reading,Any psychologist considering or currently working in the field of forensics will benefit from this book. Essential reading.
4,"An old theme, handled well.","The book is about a romantic marriage in which one spouse thinks he is marrying above himself, and the other worries she is marrying below herself. Four of the characters are narrators, the married couple, his mother and a spinster cousin. The mother imagines discussing her problems with people like Oprah and Joyce Brothers, and very different versions of their answers. The book has a good plot line, humour, interesting people, both the primary and secondary characters, and does an enjoyable job with small town life. Most of all, the book explores its main theme with honesty, and even subtlety and depth, without ever losing its light touch. Both spouses are in fact good enough for each other. This is a very enjoyable book. For me, it suffers a little from a pat ending."
3,Did well,"The cleaner did well, not great. I really had to work at spots to get them out. My carpet felt a lot cleaner even though it didn't look a lot cleaner. It was easy to use and clean. Overall I think it is a good product, just make sure you put in the effort to vacuum really really well before you use."
5,Great product,"This is our second Bissell and we are very pleased with the results. We've used it on short and long pile carpets, and even in this damp climate the carpets dry in a reasonable time. The secret is to pretreat spots and go slowly."
4,Light weight and not especially powerful..,"but,for the price, it rated 4 stars for me. So far, no leaking issues and the brush bar does rotate, as long as the front piece that holds the sucked up dirty liquid is replaced properly. If it is not, it leaks like a sieve and there is next to no suction. Regarding the time it takes for the carpet to dry, it really is not bad, if you just move slowly and give the machine a chance to suck up the liquid. If you move fast, much is left behind and it takes extra long to dry. Expect dissapointment if you want to get your whole house done in a day. The brush head is small and the machine is not very powerful, so for the cleaning to be effective you will need to take your time and make sure you get everything up. This machine is best for those without big stain problems and is best suited for those that clean their carpets with some regularity. If your carpet is trashed and really dirty, you need something bigger and more powerful (or professionals)."
4,Great for the price,"I have only had this for one day but so far so good. I have 2 indoor cats and two indoor dogs. I do have a better, heaver, more powerful steam cleaner i use 2-3 times a year, but before one room is done my back and hand is killing me. This i will use once a month. Also, our washer (in the carpeted bathroom) had a leak and the carpet was so wet it felt as if it was a yard after a septic tank overfilled.(mushy) This is , slowly, taking all that water out. You can 'suck' and not spray water. It is light and easy to use, also we have a tiny bathroom and the large cleaner would not fit well in it. If you have pets, you know that you still get a lot of hair in the uptake. This comes apart easy to clean."
4,Rug Cleaner Review,"I have found this cleaner to be very easy to operate. It does a good job considering its size and power. Very easy for me to handle (I am a senior citizen). Given that it is little, I have to refill it many times in order to complete my task, but that is OK as the ease of operation I don't mind that at all. I like it a lot."
3,Does a decent job.,"The Bissell 2080 is extremely easy to use and did a decent job on my carpets. My only suggestion is to pretreat any stains ahead of time. Overall, I was pleased with the product, its cost, and ease of use."
4,Bissell Quicksteamer is fantastic!,This Bissel 2080 Carpet Cleaner is a must to havein your house. I have always had a carpet cleaner.This carpet cleaner is so light you don't thinkthat it will clean but it does wonders for mycarpet. The only thing that took a star off isthat the water receptical is very small but Iwould rather have it be light and empty thewater more often.
2,so so,"I have this and I find it better for the attachment aspect than the carpet cleaning feature. It just doesn't seem to do much as a carpet cleaner. If you have spills on chairs or using it on car seats, it does a fair job. But cleaning carpets I am not impressed. It gets it wet, it tries to suck it up, but doesn't exactly clean, and the feature on it I hate is is pools water after you shut the thing off underneath, so you have this mess of a spot to deal with. So is why I rated it low. I have the bissell old type of canister carpet cleaner that is awesome. It has plastic parts that you can't get anymore, which is sad. But that outcleaned anything. You could saturate the stains and it would pull out the stain and the water used..."
2,Stopped spraying water,"Bissell seems to have a common problem among most, if not all of its steam cleaners in that they stop spraying water. My 2070 unit started having problems last year. I'm not sure what I did to get it restarted but I managed to get it to work for another year. It once again stopped spraying water and will now make its way to the dump."
2,"Quicksteamer, Where is the steam?",I bought this vacuum cleaner hunting for a steamer vacuum. Well what a joke? I started wondering where is the steam? Then I learned that this is no steamer. Why the hell did they name this product a steamer to make fool of people. Even though I cannot argue with its performance (Was good) but in the end I was disappointed as this was no steamer. I was hunting for a genuine steam vacuum cleaner and got fooled by its name. I returned this product the very next day.
2,Does not clean at all,"I did not think this cleaned at all. I used several times and saw no difference. (I love Bissel I have many of their products. TheBissel healthy Home vaccum is great, but very heavy.)I had better luck with my McCulloch MC-1275 heavy Duty Steam CleanerThat is for daily cleaning. I did not buy it to clean my one carpet.The Bissel carpet cleaner just did not seem to make a difference.The brushes do not touch the carpet and it does not pull the water or dirt out.It is very lightweight and easy to use, but it did not clean.I used according to the directions.It's barley used if someone wants to buy it!Makes a interesting coat rack."
2,Functional but Tedius,"- Hard to clean. Lots of unscrewing and dismantlement just to clean some areas.- Dirty water shoots out of the front if its just a ""little"" too full.+ Its cheap"
2,Bissell,"You get what you pay for. This cleaner is lightweight and should be used only on light carpet stains. It leaves streaks when you use it, so you have to move it very slowly. I would have preferred buying a better one.Bissell 3910 Momentum Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
2,ORDER THIS IF YOU NEED IT NEXT MONTH!,"ORDERED THIS ITEM ON AUGUST 27TH, TODAY IS THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER, AND IT HASN'T EVEN SHIPPED YET! YOU WOULD THINK AN ITEM THIS EXPENSIVE WOULD BE SHIPPED OUT RIGHT AWAY...I'LL BE PURCHASING LARGE ITEMS LIKE THIS FROM A STORE FROM NOW ON, VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Don't buy this one . . .,"The picture and description is deceiving. I thought that I was buying the Bissell that was on display at Wallmart. The picture and description fit. Wallmart did not restock their shelves fast enough, so I thought I was buying the same Bissell Cleaner and saving $10 in the meantime. This on-line version is a much smaller version of the cleaner, with half the power, and the tank capactity does not hold 1/2 gallon as advertised. If you want to continously fill and empty tanks, then buy this one. Otherwise, go to Wallmart and get a much better deal on a larger capacity, Larger rollers, and more powerful amp machine for $10 more."
4,"Great results, fast and easy!","I highly recommend the Quicksteamer for to people who hate the hassle and difficulty of a full size carpet steamer. It is so easy to unclip, lift and dump the dirty water reservoir, and even easier to refill the clean water reservoir. This makes it painless to do several areas with low commitment of time. Each tankfull will clean about a 4' x 6' area if not more, and most pet hair blobs up to pick up instead of clogging up the steamer. It takes up a small space as well and so easy to push. This isn't recommended for industrial or professional cleaning, but for the average user, you would be more inclined to use it more often, which is appealing."
4,Bissell Quicksteamer,So far I love it. Great for little messes. Have kids and animals and this has worked out wonderful. Little harder to do a big room as the tank isnt that large but for the price it is great!
4,Great machine for its value,I recently bought a Bissell 2080 with the hope that it would clean some light carpet stain. I have a two and a half year-old daughter so the house can be very messy. I did not expect much from an $80 machine but it exceeded my expectation. The carpet looked new again after it dried. The food stain that I wouldn't expect to come out did came out. Great machine for its value.
5,A handy little appliance.,Works well as advertised. Small profile - easy to store. We use it to clean our entrance mats. Especially handy during the winter.
5,Best Carpet Cleaner I have ever used!,"This carpet cleaner is so easy to use. It is lightweight and be moved from one room to another easily. I used to have a canister carpet cleaner and it was so bulky, heavy, and had so many hoses to hook up that I would rather just call a carpet cleaner. It does have a smaller dirty water collector but by the time I fill it up I need a rest anyway. The container that holds the cleaning liquid is easy to unattach and fill. I would recommend this cleaner to anyone that likes to clean their carpet more than once every six month. Good with pets and children cleanup!"
4,works well,"have three rugs. Works on these well. Black dirt comes up. Don't love because there is one small spout to get all the dirty water out. we have a dog, so it is hard to work the dog hair around enough to get it out of that little whole. Also sometimes tough to get 'a seal' with the front suction. Overall though, for the price I'd do it again."
1,Awful,"The solution leaks through the container and machine. After a few uses, machine started to smoke. Had to throw it away. Piece of junk."
5,this works really good.,"it's perfect for small area rugs and rooms. it would take a long time to do a full house of carpet with this, as you need to work it rather slowly to get the job done, but it does take up a lot of dirt, you can see it in the water. doesn't hold lots of fluid so you get several passes, then need to refill. but if you're not doing tons of carpet, this is a great little tool for the house. light and easy to use and fill and clean. awesome for spring cleaning of the area rugs on the hard wood floors, bought it for mom just for that reason."
4,Works well,"It works well. The tank is small for large areas, but it cleans pretty well. I have a small child and I can use this cleaner the night before and the next morning the carpets are clean and dry."
2,Moderately satisfied,This product is not recommended for highly traveled traffic areas or heavily stained carpet areas. You have to refill tank over and over to thoroughly clean arelatively small area. However it is amazing for spot areas and small jobs.
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this machine at Target because I got a new puppy who finds it fun to potty on the floor. It does a great job at freshening up plain carpet after a vacuum, but is almost worthless on pet stains. This is an ideal touch-up cleaner, and for the puppy owner, definitely not a good match. I think I'm going to buy an actual steam cleaner next."
1,pathetic,"Had it for three years, used it three times. Then the mechanism controlling the solution release valve failed and it stopped releasing the solution when the switch was depressed. Will attempt to fix it, but it is otherwise useless since it is no longer under warrantee. If you ask me, this is not an auspicious beginning for a carpet cleaning device."
1,Can't recommend it for tough stains -- dog owner review.,"I bought this steamer based on all the positive reviews here, but I found it inadequate to handle the tough stains that my three bullmastiffs can create. It has a very small track and even though I have only two rooms of carpet, it would take me quite a long time to cover the whole the whole area. And it left the stains in situ. I switched back to my favorite steamer brand so far -- the Dirt Devil vision -- and it works beautifully! It has almost twice the track size of the Bissell, a much larger tank, and it gets out the dog stains - ground in mud and dirt, slobber, urine and other accidents -- quickly and beautifully! Every time I think I finally have a stain that will beat it, I'm always surprised when it cleans my carpets like new again. I really can't recommend this Bissell steamer, it's VERY lightweight, you probably need to have fairly clean carpets to begin with -- I gave my Bissell away . . ."
3,Groovy for small stuff,Works good for small stuff..FYI if you use simple green in it as opposed to bissle carpet solution you will not only get better results but it smells better. The simple green was suggested to me from a pro that cleans carpets everyday.
5,Very pleased,"My husband and I were very happy with our recent purchase of this cleaner. We've used Bissell products for years (Green machine etc.)but wanted an upright spot cleaner- we have a small dog (15lbs) and occasionally have ""piddle"" accidents. This cleaner has been great! We learned to remove the ""piddle"" first with the cleaner and then follow the directions to spray and clean. Took no time to dry when you're careful how much spraying you do. We would highly recommend this for what we're using it for."
4,Great Shampooer,"I love this little shampooer. I wouldn't call it a deep carpet cleaner, but it does a good job for the price and power. I shampoo my carpet 3 to 4 times a year and it is just what I needed.BevyK"
3,"Not exactly a ""deep cleaner""","This product is good for light carpet cleaning. It doesn't really have enough power to deep clean anything. It is lightweight and easy to cart around the house. The water tank is very small so you will have to refill it constantly if you are doing the whole house, or even just the living room for that matter. The brushes spin from you pushing the cleaner, and are not removable for easy cleaning. Cleaner occasionally leaks from the dirty water tank when you are at the end of your half gallon in the clean tank. Recommend this for small easy clean ups and spot cleaning. If you need more than that, buy something better because this won't do it for you."
4,Good for the price,"The cleaner does its job nicely. Although mine leaked the formula a little bit, the carpet was a lot cleaner than before. One shortcoming is, the water tanks (both supplier tank and the one to hold dirty water) are too small so I had to refill it several times before I'm finished with my small room. (the room is around 3m*4m)"
4,Good lite machine,"A lot better than expected. It cleaned pretty well for amount of money spent. The only shortfall may be the water container appears to be too small therefore, you would have to fillup water more frequent."
5,Great for homes with pets....,"This is a wonderful product. I had the Bissell Powerbrush I Lightweight for over 2 years. It was used on a daily basis in a home with two doxie puppies that were being house trained. It worked great! The Bissell II has some wonderful improvements, a longer cord, larger capacity for waste water and to me the best improvement is the on/off switch being made into a pedal start not a switch on the side of the machine."
4,great until it the brush stops rotating,"The concept of the machine is brilliant: fairly powerful yet lightweight which makes cleaning stairs easier. Downside, this is my 3rd machine as they do stop working after 1 year--but the cost (cheap) makes up for it. What doesn't break after a year? Hopefully they will improve the brush--but if not I will just replace it. Again."
5,surpassed my expectations,I needed something to beat the cost of renting a machine. It's lightweight and worked really welland rugs dried really fast
5,Excellent for apartments,"This unit is lightweight but powerful. I live in an apartment and can get the managent to clean the carpet but they want you to move your furniture and have to do the whole place in one day. With this unit I can clean one area at a time, when I have the time. It was easy to assemble out of the box(3 phillips screws)and was up and running within 30 minutes of receiving it."
5,this is for the wild children only!,"when you put this album on, look out for flying rump roasts! seriously, because your enraged neighbors will be throwing rump roasts or anything else at you that they can find. and original guitarist chris holmes was knocked out by one in europe when blackie said they were going to play animal (f--- like a beast). to sum it all up, this is a nasty a$$ band. if you like metal and hard rock, this definitely belongs in your collection, but don't get it if you like softy crap like van halen."
4,wasp heavy metal,i already had this cd but mine had a real bad skip so it was time to replace it this is one of their real good albums .it came in a timely manner and as described .
4,Glad Howland isn't on this one,WASP is so much better when Stet Howland isn't in the band.Blackie was smart to fire that idiot.I know nobody really knows who he is as he's nothing more than a bar star.Such a loser.LONG LIVE WASP!Great album - great songs.
2,More than you ever wanted to know!,"This book covers the history of the White Star Line from the beginning of time. Not the most exciting read this year. The paper is of poor quality, seems to still have chunks of wood in it and the type face is not to my taste. The writing style is pedestrian at best. Lots of detail though, I haven't found any glaring errors, but you really have to be an ocean liner fanatic to get through this. Thankfully I am. For a more entertaining and interesting view, look for something by John Maxtone-Graham like The Only Way to Cross. J. P. Morgan's biographers also have lots of comments about White Star. Pictures are good, information is accurate as far as I know, but definitely not a page-turner."
2,Not recommended,"Regrettably Gardiner's latest offering ""History of the White Star Line"" is little more than a poorly written chronology of largely disconnected events in the history of the famous shipping company. While apparently factual (in contrast to his earlier ""Titanic Conspiracy"" which suggested that Titanic had been secretly switched with her sister ship and intentionally sunk) I found ""History of the White Star Line"" to be a largely unreadable assembly of historical tidbits which seem as if a collection of unrelated newspaper clippings had been bound together and covered with a dust wrapper. His research seems to be adequate, however style and editing are largely nonexistent."
4,A great documentary focusing on the early career of Wilt,"I liked this DVD. It goes all the way back to Wilt's high school days, and it features interviews with his high school coach (who in fact produced this documentary). It also features the audio from the game where he scored 100 points (I believe that game was not filmed). All in all it was well done and very nostalgic. I was left wanting more at the end, as it clocks in at a little under 1 hour. Highly recommended though for basketball fans who want to learn the history of this great athlete."
5,Greatest player ever,I loved it!!!Very informative on Wilt and his career. Love watching Wilt play and show his skill on the court. Enjoyable!!!
5,Add Picture,Please add the picture from the DVD description to the instant video description. The place where the picture should be says no image available.
4,Good,i was very interessed in chapter irianian magic i think this book gives you a very realistic idea about magic in iran .i would like talk to people how are interessed or practicing eastern magic
2,This here book; Columbo three; it badly disappointed me.,"What happened? Columbo would be deeply saddened to read how his character has been so trivialized and packaged for sensational appeal. So much of this story is padded with solicitous sex and violence. What dose oral sex have to do with case? Do we need to read how some second-level victims are ""blown apart"" by a large caliber weapon? Who can't tell what the Hoffa connection is going to be from the very start? I was very disappointed in the handling of this. There is a very minimal story line to begin with and the superfluous verbiage just makes it more tedious. Mr. Harrington can do better than this. You don't have to print ANYTHING; wait until you have the kind of story line that was so evident in the original TV series. That's what brings in the interest. What we've been given is an overdose of rumpled fluff and all the references to semen, gore and peek-a-boo sex don't make this a hotter, more palatable bowl of chili."
2,VERY disappointing...,"Compared to his other 'Columbo' works, this is by far Harrington's worst. I never thought I'd see the day when I couldn't wait to finish a Columbo mystery just to finish it and get it over with, rather than for the finale where our hero normally breaks down the case and explains all. As it is in this one he explains bugger all and the 'Hoffa connection' is both ludicrous AND unnecessary. Top that with the fact that the Columbo we see in this book is so far removed from our beloved Columbo on TV that it looks like an entirely different detective PLUS the fact that one of the main characters, Mickey, switches from a last name of Newcastle to Newhouse with irritating regularity and you've got yourself a pretty lame effort... sorry!"
2,Very disappointed,"It doesn't look anything like the picture, it doesn't display as shown in the picture either. Item is really fragile and cheaply made. I would not recommend it."
2,eye in the sky,very detail a little complecated very small parts so i donated it to one of my disable fellow veterans from iraq war.
1,Beware!!,"We ordered this piece along with the 6 drawer dresser and the nightstand. All of which had scratches on them. This piece, however had the most damanged. It took Target three times to send us this before we got one that wasn't extremely damanged. We had to repackage and ship back the first two which was a headache on it's own. Even the UPS man told us he has to pick up a lot of Target stuff because they don't package it well and it should really be sesnt Freight instead of UPS ground. I love the look of the piece and wish it was better quality."
1,Drawers do not fit well,i built the dresser step by step and found it hard to screw in some of the screws and then the fit doesn't fit as well as ikea products. very disappointed
5,Works great,"I use this to step up to 77mm filters on my 35-70mm f/2.8 Nikon lens. It's an odd size so I didn't want to buy a whole other set of filters just for that lens. Using a step-up ring isn't a fast way to swap filters, but it works very well for what it was designed to do. I just need to get an extra 77mm lens cap"
5,Does what it's supposed to...,"...nothing special, just converts your filter ring size. The Adorama brand seems to be just fine."
5,works as advertised,"I got this step up ring for my 24-200 lens to mount a matte box. Works, finish is good and I haven't had any complaints. I would buy from this company again."
1,silly,"E.E.E.I. is simply silly - the man is a legend, in person on-stage he can move audiences even when they do not speak english (I saw him in Rio and he lit the place up!)but he is no philosopher, this book is a read/watch one time and file in the round bin"
4,English,"As a Christian Reformed Dutchman from Minnesota, I must admit that I may be a bit biased in reviewing a book written by a Christian Reformed Dutchman from Minnesota. However, Schelhaas's page-long discussions of 100 common (like, grass, yahoo) and uncommon (alas, fete, maudlin, shrove, sostenuto) words are informative, humorous, and thought-provoking. Although his target audience is clearly people like himself, (his tone is almost like a Christian devotion book at times) the words and their histories are interesting to anyone who speaks English - if you're reading this, you'd like the book. My only carp is that some phrases and formats are repetitive and lose power quickly. However, the essays were written for the radio, to be presented one at a time, and, I think, are meant to be read one or two at a time as well. Browse through it, find a word that interests you, and be amazed at this incredible language we call our own."
4,It's alive,"I was fortunate enough to be present at one of the recording sessions for this CD. It was performed over two nights in Boston Symphony Hall and the recording was assembled from those performances. The performance was first-rate and Dutilleux himself was in attendance. The premiere actually occurred a few months earlier (again in Boston) and the composer made minor tweaks in the score before the recording.This is not the very best of Dutilleux (that's a very high standard), but it's still quite a good piece. It is essentially French--even with its tone rows. The compositional backbone is a little more obvious that some of Dutilleux's other pieces, but we're still fortunate to have the composer doing good work at such a late point in life.The CD is short--holding only this single piece--but well worth a number of hearings."
5,one guitar one bass one GREAT recording!!,This CD is pure magic....Manring is a world famous bass player and this fellow David Cullen on nylon string guitar sounds like Ralph Towner on steroids! The songs are catchy and still very inventive and intelligent. The interplay between these two is remarkable and yet according to the liner notes this was recorded as an afterthought to a jazz festival they both played at.....amazing. This is one of those rare recordings that actually improves with age and more playing...highly recommended.
3,I smear this lotion on my self.,"Sometimes when i use this or wear it, I can keep going on and on until i've used up the entire bottle."
2,Didn't enjoy it,"I was disappointed. I did not like any of the cuts on this CD. I don't really know why. It was just not enjoyable. Also, there are 10 cuts listed on this CD. There were, actually, only 8 songs on the one that I have. I don't know what happened to the other 2 cuts. There were just not there."
4,"Pedantic, yet thorough","Parkes writes in a manner that does his subject justice -- though the index isn't quite what I need it to be, his research (as far as I can judge) is exquisitely thorough, and the incunabula in the appendices are fascinating. Compliments to the author, regrets to the indexer."
3,no history!,"It has a lot of photographs, but i expected them to be a little bigger. the book in the screen seem to show a little bigger photos, and there is no info!!! no history , very very little.I'll have to do more research or buy more books on the subject."
1,"Way too ""new age"" for me","I bought this CD hoping it would help me improve my confidence with public speaking, but I was very disappointed. It has an extremely heavy ""new age"" and hypnotic feel and sound that I found very irritating. I turned it off after about 15 minutes, and I never plan to turn it on again. It will be headed to Goodwill with the next load.I recommend ""The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" by Dale Carnegie. It is a classic that has never been surpassed. It provides extensive help and practical guidance that has been very valuable to me both in terms of technique and confidence. Dale Carnegie was THE expert on public speaking; his books and courses have helped millions of people overcome their fears and become effective speakers. His books have a positive ""you can do it"" attitude that I like."
5,A great complement to Janet Esposito's book,"This is a great CD on its own or as a complement to Janet's book. My favorite thing about the CD is that you can listen to selected pieces of it for a quick reinforcer if you are short on time, or you can listen to the entire CD when you have the luxury of time to treat yourself to a relaxing and centering experience. The CD is great for my head, my heart, my spirit, and my body. I will use it often and recommend it highly to others."
5,Just what I needed!,"Public speaking had always been a horrific experience for me. Yet as a forensic expert I have to frequently teach classes related to my work as well as speaking at various church functions. These experiences were so dreadful to me that they were actually taking a toll on my physical health. What I like about this CD is that Janet is very truthful and doesn't offer a magic bullet, but she does show you how to gain control over your reactions to these situations. It is amazingly simple to implement the techniques presented in this CD and they do work. Still I suspect that most of us who have suffered from this problem never really knew how to access the power within ourselves to overcome our reactions to these situations. I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, I would have paid ten times the price for this CD and considered it a bargain."
5,Great CD,"I thought that Janet's CD was extremely effective, and I used it before presentations. It helped me tremendously and encouraged me to focus on positive thoughts rather than those that were self-defeating. I would highly recommend it for those with public speaking anxiety, and even those people who only get slightly anxious before presentations. Loved it!"
4,Penguin 170 Aquarium Filter,"This filter is fine for the mid-sized aquarium. It is excellent for both particulate removal and for phosphate reduction. Know the necessary clearance measurements for both inside and outside the aquarium before buying. You will need to know the clearance necessary between the wall and the aquarium as well as how much room you will need inside the aquarium to be sure the aquarium can accomodate this filter. Given the proper installation, I recommend this filter for its excellent results."
4,So lame it should qualify for disability!!!,"This is not only the worst star trek game since ""APPLE TREK"" (on Apple 2 E computer,,,anyone remember that??) but also the worst x-box game ever to foul my laser!!!! You dont get to control the big ships!! What you are given is a lame shuttlecraft that weakly blasts the big starships with a laughable phaser and torpedo effect!! WHY DID THEY EVEN BOTHER to make this game!!!Like many I was hoping this would be similar to the old SNES star trek academy game where you could choose a starship and go against other ships from the tv and movie series!! NOW THAT WAS A GAME!!! You could play against another person as well which rocked!! Imagine the fun of a cloaking shield!!! Then out of the dark you materialise behind the enemy and blow him away !!BUT THIS!!!! THIS TRAVESTY is the saddest effort I have ever seen!!! PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME AND TEACH THE DEVELOPERS A LESSON!!P.S. the tech tv series X-PLAY gave it 1 out of 5 as well haha!!"
1,Absolutely Dissapointed,"What is this? Maybe it's just me, but I thought I was a pretty good gamer, I normally beat all my games, mostly in the first week easy. But, after or during the 5th mission I flat out couldn't beat it. After 5 or 6 tries at 30 minutes a pop, I gave up. This could be quite possible the worst gaming experience I have ever had."
4,A GOOD STARSHIP DOG FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!,I have been looking for a good Star Trek video game since the 1980's when the Star Trek arcade game was out. I saw the traler for it and it looks great.I say get the X-box verson of this game. The look of the game will be a lot better than PS2...
3,good game for Star Trek fans,"Although it's not the best game I've ever played,it is fun to play, especially if you grew up watching the original series. I wish it had more of the original characters besides just Sulu and Chekov. And it would have been fun to take control of the actual Starship instead of just the fighters. Which by the way seems to be the biggest deviation from Star Trek : I don't remember any fighters! I would have probably rated it lower if not for the fact that I am a lifelong fan of Star Trek. And also, I enjoy any flight simulation type of game to begin with. In all fairness, I am only 5 or 6 levels into the game. So, there may be some surprises later on that will impress me, or maybe not."
2,Another Disappointed Fan,"This game had everything going for it, even Walter and George reprising their roles as Sulu and Chekov, but the game just falls flat. The levels are repetitive and very difficult, almost impossible even with invinciblity as another reviewer here said. The game gets old fast, the game play is just the same thing every level.This game is also very dull, I tried to play this game twice and I always stop by the fourth level. The story itself seems messed up since the Excelsior crew transforms into their mirror characters in the game when in the real mirror universe in Trek, there is already someone in an alternate universe that looks like you but acts different. The game just feels really slapped together and made for gaming pros because the game is HARD. That can't be said enough."
3,Better Than Nothing,"Located in the ""Mirror Universe"" of Star Trek TOS, the game features the voices of George Takei and Walter Koenig. Sadly, the game is intended for a very skilled kind of player, used to dogfights. This, and the lack of proper controls make this game a hard one to master. The graphics are average, below the ones we're used to see in PC games of the ST franchise. However, it's enjoyable, and the difficulty to finish every mission gives a sense of real achievement every time one is completed."
1,Crappy,"Some of the levels are seemingly impossible. Even with cheats like infinite shields, the game is insanely hard. In one of the levels you have a couple minutes to destroy an insane amount of ships. Don't waist your time unless you are a serious trekkie and really good with this type of game."
2,Should have heeded the warnings,"I went ahead and bought this game, despite the repeated onine warnings against it.While I actually enjoyed the ship graphics (the character CG is terrible), I got terribly frustrated. Even with all the cheats, this game is near impossible to complete. I gave it a month, on and off, and finally got rid of it.Unless you just want the opportunity to blow up original series starships, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away!"
2,"Great actors, lukewarm performance","This is one of the more historically interesting WWII movies I've seen. It's one of the few that explore the implications of Germany's development of the V1 (buzz bomb) and V2 (missle) but it's one of Sophia Loren's more lacklustre performances. George Peppard comes across as a WWII Banacek. If you're interested in Germany's missle development, take a look. If you're looking for a darned good WWII movie, opt instead for The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, The Great Escape, or To Hell and Back."
3,Wait for a better print !,"I gave it a 3 star not because of the movie but because of the print used. It looks as if it was taped from a VHS version. It is not bad at all but it could have been better. You can't expect much for $7.99.Unless you want to own a copy on DVD very badly, wait until a major studio like MGM releases it. I think MGM has the rights."
1,Operation Plop,"What a waste!I've loved this movie since first seeing it in the theater back in the 60's.I own the Laser Disc, which MGM did a fairly good job with.But this DVD is a joke. It's grainy, fuzzy and the beginning credits are cut out! It's also in full screen -- why --considering the original film was made in 70mm.The audio is also another disappointment. The Laser Disc has surround sound, yet this muddy transfer to DVD is only 2.0.I'm hanging on to my Laser Disc until Trinity Entertainment comes to its senses and re-releases this movie in better condition."
1,What a work-up,"I remember seeing 'Operation Crossbow' in the late '60s soon after it came out. Resplendent with MGM's roaring lion logo and the superb Panavision presentation - on which basis I bought this newly issued DVD. What a let down. Only a 4x3 format and a pretty fuzzzy transfer, despite the cover proclaimation of a 'digital'mastering'. No opening logo - straight into the main title and only 4 chapters to the entire film. No extras, not even a trailer. Atleast it could have been issued in the original Panavision format. Barely worth 1-star. A total waste of money"
1,Glad I cancelled,I preordered this one which is from the same company which released From hell To Victory. FHTV was a bad transfer to dvd. Anybody order Attack Force Z ? That one looks like somebody made the copies in a basement. How a reputable company like Amazon can sell such poor products is beyond me.
4,Operation Crossbow movie review,"This movie was made when the horror of World War 2 was wearing off and being replaced with early attempts by the Hollywood crowd(English included) to rewrite history, to put the action into the minds of the taxpayers as having been carried out for the protection of the citizens of the U.S. and England.How did the Germans come so far in developing the world's best rockets, the worlds first guidance computers, the worlds best submarines,tanks,artillery,and all to fence in Europe, unless they got financing through the 1920's and 1930's with Massive amounts of money from British and American Banks. And if so, for what specific purpose?"
4,Ladybird,"This book is a picture book with a small amount of words for young children, along the lines of the poem ""Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home."""
3,Musically Weak,"I love Charlie Zaa. His voice is interesting and I find I rather enjoy it, despite its quirky quality. I also love bachata. One would think I would love this cd, howver I do NOT.The music is nice, the vocals are nice. But Charlie Zaa is, it would seem, not especially talented when it comes to the Afro side of Afro-Latin music. Quite simply- he doesnt sing in rhythm. He is no sonero nor is he a bachatero. He does boleros and does them well, but absolutely does NOT adapt his singing to the rythmic structure of the bachata music. His timing and phrasing remain the same.I am not sure if he is even to blame, it sounds like he sang songs and then someone in the studio plopped the vocal tracks down over a few bachata tracks. Initially, it isnt jarring but a few songs into the cd and you begin to notice that the singing remains the same even when the music changes.This cd does neither Charlie nor bachata any justice. Pass it by."
4,Not for Thru-Body Short Scale Bass,"These are probably great sounding and playing strings. But, I'll never know since they don't fit my 30"" short scale through-body Fender Mustang Bass. The through-body design adds at least an extra inch to how long the strings need to be, so the blue fuzzy core doesn't clear the first fret to get behind the nut to the machine heads. Now I'm waiting for those elusive La Bella flatwounds custom-made for the Mustang bass..."
5,Could tell the difference,Awesome. We bought a mixed case of Oktoberfest micro-brews to compare against this kit. We honestly couldn't tell the difference between the homebrews and the micro-brews. Now we are getting ready to brew this kit again.
4,Das ist good bier.,"This was the first lager I have attempted since I started home brewing. The kit was straight forward, but lacked the detail for a true lager. I supplemented the instructions with other reference material. The batch is bottle conditioning at this time, but the beer turned out great so far. The color and clarity is good and the flavor will be great."
4,Great combination of Pickers,"I reviewed this CD for the official website of Chet Atkins, ...These guys each have their own brilliance when playing solo, but playing together, they are like peanut butter and jelly.As James Jensen said, this is the best album Merle Travis and Jerry Reed NEVER made!Tom Redmond"
5,beautiful,"i dont own this cdjust wanted to comment on how beautiful this song isgreat music and melodys and words from this supertalented womanbuy the album ""little earthquakes""its amazing!!!"
1,not what i expected,"it just wasn't what i was expecting... I was looking for a video that my husband n I could exercise to, not ""intimately connect"", so I was disappointed in what I received."
3,OK post Tubular Bells,"Much of the same thing as the previous, but much less inventive or invocative. Nice for fans of Mike, maybe a must. I was dissapointed, manly because I KNOW Mike Oldfield could do better. However, I do like the album and listen to it often, just NOT as often."
4,Pronunciation?,"Is it ""her guest"" or ""her jest""? A great second effort from a reclusive genius. Still one of the great 1970's artists!"
5,Unique in popular music,"The thing about Oldfield is how different his music is from other popular music. Not being a trained musician it's hard for me to articulate but I'll try. Orchestral and sweeping with distinct movements, the music communicates emotion and thoughts without lyrics. I don't know where Hergest Ridge is, but I've traveled there with Oldfields help. A great work of art, and one that finds more inspiration in Bach than Elvis Presley.I once read that the Moody Blues were the Sistine Chapel of popular music but Oldfield is more deserving of that comparison."
2,There's Something to be Said for Leaving Well Enough Alone,"I was thrilled last week when I ran across this CD release of Hergest Ridge. I have had the pleasure of having owned and heard the original release. I just received my CD in the mail today, and, of course, immediately put it on. In a nutshell, I'm very thankful I have my copy of the original LP. So much of the depth of sound is missing from this remix, not to mention entire sections missing. A number of sections that used to build and build and build, tugging a certain way at one's emotions (or at least mine), are now missing. I'd rather hear the pops and hisses on the original rather than this sterile rendition. I guess I'll have to retrieve my LP's from storage and get hold of a new turn table somewhere!"
4,Oldfield's underestimated masterpiece,"In many ways, this album is insignificant compared to its illustrious predecessor. 'Tubular Bells' changed the lives of Oldfield and his boss Branson forever. And although it wasn't the first of its kind, it was the first to find mass appeal. It opened up massive audiences for bands like Tangerine Dream and perhaps even composers such as Steve Reich.In contrast, 'Hergest Ridge' did not change the course of popular music. But in several ways it is the better album. The melody on side one is the most beautiful that Oldfield has ever written. The oboe part is particularly poignant.I've never been so impressed by side two, which is why I didn't rate this a five-star album.Several of the reviews of this album here make comparisons with other mixes of 'Hergest Ridge'. For me, the difference is fairly abstruse. Suffice to say that this remastered version sparkles. Buy it!"
5,Among the best.,"Herbgest Ridge, Ommadawn and the Origional Tubular Bells Hybrid, are the best of Mike Oldfield."
2,Tragic,"I know that this remaster is based on Mike Oldfield's 'improved' Hergest Ridge mix. But I think this is a case where the artist should have left well enough alone, and the label should have gone back to the original masters and re-released THOSE. Oldfield's tinkering did nothing to improve upon the original work. If anything, it robbed it of some of its most beautiful musical moments.The original version of 'Hergest Ridge' (hisses and all) is still preferable to this one. Tragic, but true."
3,Mike Oldfield - 'Hergest Ridge' (Virgin) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1974,this was Oldfield's second album. His decent follow-up to 'Tubular Bells'. Like 'Tubular...',this CD reissue has two lengthy tracks of progressive/new age(as some might call it).""Hergest Ridge,Part 1""(21:40) and ""Hergest Ridge,Part 2""(18:51).Maybe not a disc I'd play that often,but worth a spin every now and again.Other players featured on this CD are Lindsay Cooper-bass&oboe,Sally Oldfield(Mike's sister)-vocals&voice effects,Terry Oldfield-flute and Chilli Charles-drums."
5,Please put Homefront on DVD,"""Homefront"" was one of my all time favorite shows! PLEASE put all of the seasons on DVD! I believe there were three seasons in all. Kyle Chandler was great then and he is the main reason I've been watching ""Friday Night Lights"" this Fall season."
5,DVD Please,"I was young when this show aired, but it has stayed with me and most certainly needs to be on DVD. Great Show!"
5,Please DVD it!!,"I keep checking to see if they have published the Homefront TV series on DVD. It was a great show, and I would really enjoy watching it again."
5,Homefront,This show was on when I was in high school. I loved it immensely and have been looking for a way to watch it again.
1,No warranty,"Used about 5 times in 7 months. Found 3 vertical cracks (at piece joints) that leak steam. Since there is no manufacturer info, I contacted the seller. Seller refused the warranty. Seller replied in her email ""You are probably from China and you are probably aware that China is not going to have a warranty on a cooking pan that is plain and simple"". Similar item is sold in China at much lower price without warranty. Seller wants to sell at high price in US with low service in China."
3,Better than electrical steamer,"I prefer this to the electrical steamer. It's good size and very convenient. However, once you have made a decision to get this type of steamer do your research, as the product does not look very sturdy (I have read from some other reviews), you might find a similar product for a lot less."
1,did not like,i could not head it it did not work at all this is 2 time that i buy somethings from you and did not work
2,NOT a Logitech,"Works OK, but this is not a Logitech, it is a Labtec which is not affiliated with Logitech in any way."
5,Two Great Stories,"I always read Linda Howard and Loving Evangeline was as great as expected. Not expected was the equally enjoyable story by Allison Leigh; now I'll be looking for more stories by her, too!"
3,inks a killer,yes its a cheap fairly good printer but with toner @ 80 dollars a pop I'd think twice before purchasing again
3,nice and works with Linux,"This is a nice inexpensive multifunction printer/scanner/copier. Not the best possible but the price/performance is really great. Works very nicely in Windows, but would not run in Linux when I first got it. Fortunately, Samsung has now got drivers for this printer for linux and it works nicely."
5,Takes a lickin and keeps tickin!,"This is a sturdy little all in one laser printer. For the price, it is unbeatable. For the quality, it has lasted longer than my HP Officejet all in one printer. I highly recommend this if you need a economical office laser printer."
2,Poor print quality,I purchased the 4016 about 5 months ago. The print quality has been really bad. I am suprised others in the reviews have not complained. The toner that came with it has run out. I will be putting in new toner and see if fixes the quality problem.
4,Good overview of Cornell & his work,"This book is large format with many full color photos of the work. It presents a history of Cornell and his work with a good amount of personal detail. If you like Joseph Cornell's work and want to learn more, this is an excellent book for the shelf or the coffee table."
4,"Dense, difficult but rewarding","This is a book I recommend only if you are interested in the experimental use of language or interested in everything Beckett.I found I needed to read this small volume multiple times before the repeated images, the disjoint non-sentences, the crisp objectiveness of the language began to congeal into an interesting study of self-awareness. Even the first reading leaves one knowing they are in the hands of a master wordsmith. Well worth the time but certainly not for everyone."
3,"Adequate for the job, but not the best quality...","We're pretty into smoothies at our house and we've found the Back to Basics mixers to be adequate for the price. They do work well for a year or so, but the frustrating part is that when something breaks you don't have the option of ordering parts.This is our second mixer so knowing it's life would be limited by the typical quality of the company, we purchase the least expensive one (the Smoothie Maker Freeze). $20 every year or so isn't too bad. I wouldn't invest in a more expensive model as you're pretty much out of luck when it stops working.If there was something a bit more expensive out there that would last longer, I'd be interested, but this does the job for a cheap price.Oh, and don't put any of the parts in the dishwasher. The product manual even advises against filling the pitcher with hot water. They really should put a little more quality into these as it's a great idea."
2,Works well but terrible quality,"I bought this smoothie maker because I needed one for a party and my old one broke. Thankfully it worked well for the party but the next week the stirring mechanism broke and another week later the dispenser broke my dad tried to fix it but he couldn't then the a month later the lid snapped in half and finally now it just won't turn on. It worked, but I DO NOT recommend buying this!"
2,Does't chop frozen fruit,"I just bought this blender today. I just used it to make a smoothie and I added frozen fruit and yogurt, but it doesn't even chop through frozen peaches. How can it chop through ice if it can't even chop through fruit? The dispenser part was useless because it did not blend my smoothie well enough so that it could come out of the dispenser. Also, this blender is extremely loud! I'll probably be returning it for a more expensive, regular blender."
1,Disappointment,"I needed a blender for exclusively making smoothies so this product sounded good. It turned out to be a total disappointment: it took a long time to blend frozen fruit, was very noisy and the dispenser didn't work. The only positive thing was the stir stick.After about 1 week the dispenser cracked and started leaking so badly that I could no longer use the blender.I recommend investing a few more dollars in something that is sturdier, has less frills, and lasts longer (I now own the Osterizer 14-Speed and am very happy with it)."
2,A disappointment for Oldfield fans,"Anyone fond of Mike Oldfield's other work, whether instrumental or song-based albums, will be disappointed by this one. The songs are generally bland with Mike's usual strong melodies conspicuous by their absence.Only 'Holy' sung by Adrian Belew and 'Blue Night' sung by then Oldfield regular Maggie Reilly show glimpses of the inventiveness and tunefulness Mike usually delivers.It just sounds like his heart wasn't in it - subsequent releases Amarok and Tubular Bells II suggest he was storing up his energies for later projects."
3,Has its moments...,"As others will tell you, this is far from Mike Oldfield's best album. Scansion and lyrics are occasionally tortured (see ""Holy"" for the former, as another reviewer has mentioned, the choruses of ""Far Country"" and ""Innocent"" for the latter), but there are bright points. Adrian Belew makes ""Holy"" work, and the bridge of ""Far Country"" is a delightful glimpse of what could have been as Oldfield and Belew trade guitar licks--not in the ""Look at me, I'm a virtuoso and can play really, really fast"" style of McLaughlin and de Lucia, but always tasteful and suited to the tranquil nature of the song. The religious allusions come thick and fast on this album, but my favorite track has to be ""Blue Night,"" IMHO featuring Oldfield's best lyric writing since ""Crime of Passion,"" fine guitar work, and Maggie O'Reilly's always excellent vocals. Call it Oldfield's worst, but it's still worthwhile."
5,"Slow, sexy, lush...","I'm keying in a brief review, after having perused the reviews of some apparently dedicated Oldfield aficionados. True enough, this is not representative of his other works but once again some singles paint complex, emotional landscapes... Blue Night is a slow, sensuous, narrative-driven erotic masterpiece worth the album itself..."
4,Second-rate Oldfield...But still a good album,"Okay, so this isn't Oldfield's best work. You should, however, keep one thing in mind: second-rate work by Oldfield is still head and shoulders above the best work by others.This is an atypical Oldfield work in a lot of ways. Oldfield, an extraordinarily talented multi-instrumentalist, made his name recording albums where (through the miracle of overdubbing) he played the vast majority of the instruments himself. Here he uses plenty of other musicians. The composition on this album are also unlike a lot of his other work.But different isn't necessarily bad. The title track, ""Runaway Son,"" ""Blue Night"" and ""Holy"" are more than worth the price of the CD. Can you get significantly better Mike Oldfield work? You bet. But for a paltry 12 bucks, you won't regret having this album as a companion piece to his best work."
1,Thsi is Mike Oldfield?,"What an utter piece of crap. Did they sign Mike to a contract for this one with the caveat the he write cliched and uninspired pop song garbage? How did Adrian Belew get involved with this nonsense? If you love the albums Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn, Incantations, and inspired compositions on albums such at 5 Miles Out you will find it hard to believe this is the same artist. Too bad Mike got involved with the Exegesis thing, it sure didn't help his composition."
1,Substandard pop fare,"I love Mike Oldfield, and even really like his early to mid 80's pop output (""Moonlight Shadow"", ""To France"", ""Family Man"") but this is what happens when the execs at the record label push you to make even more commercial music. I admire for Mike actually doing it in the early 80's, but doing it his way. This album is nothing more than pure pop fluff which sounds, well almost embarrassing. And the cheezy synths that were so in vogue make this album sound completely dated. This review may sound a bit harsh but I am tired of record companies ruining good artists' reputations and making them pump out substandard garbage like this in the name of the BOTTOM LINE.Even if you're a die hard fan, I'd say skip this one."
1,recordcompany went crazy,"I appreciate many efforts of this artist, but here the record company divulged in crying rubbish. Only 3 acceptable tracks: Holy, Earth moving, Blue night. OK Innocent may join in as well. All the rest is just not so much worth. Get Amarok, Songs of distant earth, Ommadawn, Tubular bells III and rock on"
3,"Create Irrevocable Trust, buy second to die life insurance","This book makes a pursuasive case for creating, at nearly any age (assuming you have a net worth in excess of $2-3 milion), an irrevocable life insurance trust, and using the cash to fund a second to die life insurance policy. The proceeds will be used to pay estate taxes, giving you huge leverage over other alternative investments. All good concepts, proved with numerous and interesting examples. Unfortunately, the book is redundant, starts out a bit ""hard sell"", and has a defensive tone throughout. Mr. Kaye would be better served by writing in a less collequial way...more ""professional"" in tone. And, not frustrating his reader who eagerly turns each page to learn new concepts, only to find Mr. Kaye making the same point over and over again. It is almost as though Mr. Kaye doesn't think he will be believed...so he repeats the thesis again and again. It got tiring..."
3,You might be able to get something good out of this,"Like another reviewer has said, this books has a lot of AFC (Average Frustrated Chump) material in it. There are a few good tips in the book and I would recommend it to naturally good looking guys (the author is a part time model which is why I think the material works for him)."
2,Disappointing,"General common sense advice on confidence and self-improvement, but nothing very specific or useful.There are other books much more helpful if one wants to learn how to approach and attract women."
5,Awesome!!!,This book is great!!! The stories are great!! the techniques are great!! You will enjoy reading this book!
5,This book is just what the dating world needs...,"As a single female, I didn't think I would like this book. After a friend told me about it, I was interested in seeing what the talk was about and read it...I couldn't put it down, it was so interesting. I love hearing from men's point of views on how they think they know what women want and need. I was shocked that I actually agreed with the writers on just about every tip in the book! I told all my girlfriends they should read it too, just reverse the male version to the female version, it applies to everyone. I would highly recommend this book, it is a great gift also!"
4,Their best songs,"I had to buy it because my favorite songs were on there. No1 ""Hunted when the minutes drag"". No2 ""So alive"". No3 a reprise from the Temptations ""Ball of confusion"". No4 ""Kundalini express"" and finally No5 ""Saudade"".They were pretty original."
3,Bad collection of a great Band,"It would be almost impossible to make a greatest hits album of Love and Rockets without leaving some of their great songs out, but it seems that they actually omited some of their best songs ever, for instance ""All In My Mind"" or ""An American Dream"". I would not recommend this album very much, the tracks selection is poor."
3,decent,"A decent collection, but you'll need to supplement this with ""Express,"" ""Earth Sun Moon"" and ""Love and Rockets,"" three great CDs."
1,Not worth $1.oo,"While cheap, this remote is no bargain! Poorly written instructions, out of date codes and non functional equipment make this remote a poor paper weight and an even more worthless remote. Tried programming three items (TV, VCR and DVD) after an hour I got the VCR to turn off and on. If you are retired, or don't have enough to do this could be a 7 day project, otherwise you might want to try ANY other brand."
1,Do not buy this book!,"I would have given this book a negative rating if I could have. The idea of this activity book is a great one, but the facts of the book are nonexistent. If you are looking for an activity book that has facts about Pocahontas's life this is not the book for you. It is only about 10-12 pages long and since it is activity book there is not much writing, but pretty much everything in the book is incorrect.If you are looking for something for your children that tells the real story this is not the book for you at all. I do not know where the author got her information, but it is so horribly inaccurate that it made my head hurt. For a great children's book about Pocahontas look to Jean Fritz's The Double Life of Pocahontas, one of a handful of great books that get the facts correct.Stay far away from this book, and anything in this series for that matter as they are all horrible inaccurate."
5,Treasure Trove of Information!,"""Griffon-Powered Mustangs"" is a must have for any air racing aficionado's library. Profusely illustrated with quality black & white, as well as color images, ""Griffon-Powered Mustangs"" gives an in-depth history of three airframes: N7715C (Miss RJ/Rotofinish Special/Red Baron), World Jet, and Miss Ashley II. The last is not a true Mustang, but a reproduction, but should rightly be included in any book on the subject. The icing on the cake is the inclusion of a chapter on the history of the Rolls Royce Griffon engine (replete with pictures and diagrams), and background on Vendetta, a P-51 pylon racer that greatly influenced the construction of the Miss Ashley II. Any modelling enthusuast (such as myself) wishing to replicate any or all of these air racers, needs to obtain this book. ""Griffon-Powered Mustangs"" is an informative and entertaining read. Highly recommended!"
4,Good,I really liked this book. It isn't all history of all romance. I really became interested in its plot for more than its romancic interludes or history. I highly recommend it.
3,"I've read better, I've read worse","I could see the plot twists coming a mile away, the love story took all of ten pages, and the ending was rather flat. But it was well paced and interesting enough to keep me reading until the end."
4,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read (from a Non-Gusher),"While Bradshaw's works always maintain a high level of excellence in writing and historical detail, this semi-classic is my favorite. It's the story of a company of Sarmatians (of what? Yeah, I'd never heard of them either) who, having been conquered by the Romans, have no choice but to join the Roman Army, and are sent to garrison the semi-rebellious Isle of Britain. History, a little romance, some great fight/action sequences, and a happy but not sappy ending. Great characters, great writing, great book! (I'd give it 5 stars, but only Jane Austen gets 5 stars from me: everybody else must bow to innate genius and be content with what I can given.)"
5,Great read,"One of my favourites of this author. There's plenty of action, historical facts which are - as always - well researched and a bit of feel-good romance and happy endings. Bradshaw manages to write as if she'd been there, easily bringing past beliefs and practices to life. Great read and well worth the money! Re-read many times."
5,Whole series is excellent.,I am enjoying this series. Well written. Enthralling mystery series with a great illumination of Ancient Rome. Has characters that are enjoyable and fairly realistic. Recommended!
4,One man's journey to earn the coveted title of Smokejumper,"Smokejumpers have led the attack on wildfire in the United States for over 50 years. This well-written and interesting book follows one man's rookie year as a Smokejumper. From his first nervous day to the pain of the death of a fellow firefighter. It is easy-to-read, informative and would appeal to anyone who loves firefighting or our natural resources. Especially recommended for wildland firefighters."
5,Every Problem Creates a New One,"In the above, I believe borrowed from William S. Burroughs, we have a succinct statement of what's really going on in our processed world. Mr. Titus has his pen pricking at the vein of our modern condition as it were. Not to say that it won't be fun. It is. It should or will be illegal. Think Mark Pahualaniak and Mark Leyner and maybe Doestoevski if he wrote for the SF Chronicle (and NOT the Examiner). I won't spoil it by telling you what happens. The Adventures of Farley Wileywitz is quite worthwhile as well."
4,Mixed reaction....,"Before I start, let me point out that I only find about four photos with Betty Page in them. Most of the girls were unknown to me, but a few pop up and you say, oh, I know that one from such-and-such. That is what makes it so interesting - the knowledge that thousands of women, girlfriends, housewives, mothers, students, tried to make money and make a living by posing for pin-ups, nude photos and stag films. That girl next door WAS the girl next door. For adults only, no matter what the kids say, don't let them see this. Some photos are grouped into subjects, like girls posing with cigarette, but no real order.I liked it and look at it a lot, but it is what it says - cheesecake. Not a serious study or history and does not pretend to be. Buy it, enjoy it, keep it safe."
2,Size isn't Everything,"While the subject is interesting the approach brings nothing new to the subject. The numerous illustrations are not organized in an interesting or novel way.As if to reflect the poor quality of the material and editorial approach the physical product is shoddy. The reproductions are poor, the book is not solidly bound.On the bright side it should not last very long."
4,Heart-breaking tale of survival,"Like the hero of ""All the Pretty Horses,"" the first book in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, Billy Parham is a teenager who crosses the border into Mexico, where he must struggle for survival at a primitive level. At first, he makes the crossing to release a wolf he has trapped and cannot bear to kill. Later, he returns with his brother. In the course of this novel, Billy undergoes just about every misfortune it is possible to encounter, becoming progressively more wretched until the final pages, an understated vignette with a potent, heartrending effect.McCarthy is a fine writer and story-teller, particulary in the early section concerning the wolf, but I have to remove a star because of a number of dull episodes in which Billy encounters various old Mexicans, gypsies, and soldiers who inflict their convoluted philosophies upon us."
5,A miracle in prose,"Set in the late 30's and early 40's, the novel follows Billy Parham on several journeys back and forth from New Mexico to Old Mexico. Both Billy and the characters he encounters on his journeys suffer immense loss and hardship. It is this sense of tragic experience that lies at the heart of the novel. One of the many ideas McCarthy touches on is the meaning that experience acquires through the retelling thereof. Thus the reader himself becomes interwoven into the story's meaning. McCarthy's beautifully lyrical rendering of the landscape is stunning, while his exploration of the themes of man's relationship to self, nature, and God is timeless. The Best of the Border Trilogy."
4,"Great book, but a letdown from ""Pretty Horses""","This is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story, but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this Border Trilogy. McCarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of ""All The Pretty Horses"" and instead became much more wordy and allegorical. I appreciated the straight-ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time. In The Crossing, the language was as beautiful, but there were often stories and sub-plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book. These asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters, but for me weakened the story."
3,Definitely not his best work,"I have read 5 of Cormac's books and enjoy his writing immensely but this book is different. The first half of the book is captivating but the last half is long and meandering. The conclusion was an uninspired letdown. Also, there is so much Spanish dialogue in critical parts of the book I became frustrated having missed critical information. All the Pretty Horses was excellent. Stop there and forget the trilogy."
3,Blood meridian is better,"It's surely a good book,but not as good and interestingas ""blood meridian""..."
2,Starts off okay and then sinks,"This story starts off with promise, but then quickly sinks to despair and stays there. You are left with a sinking feeling of having wasted your time. If you want to get depressed turn on the news, don't bother with this book."
3,Difficult to read and to forget,"I am a big fan of prose and loved All The Pretty Horses. However, I must say that I labored through this second book, frankly, because I could not understand all of the Spanish dialogue; I kept feeling like I was an outsider to a conversation between foreign people.On the positive side, I am still haunted by much of the images in this novel. It is also one of the most thought provoking works I've read in awhile; trying to piece together all of the parts in an effort to understand what Mr. McCarthy is trying to say will keep you busy rereading sections all of the time.I will be reading the final piece of the trilogy, so overall the work is very good."
3,Will Keep On With Next Book of Trilogy,"Having really liked ""All the Pretty Horses"" and ""The Road"" I began reading ""The Crossing"" with high expectations. However, lots of long windy philosophic speeches from characters met only briefly here and there, and an excess of Spanish from start to finish left me disappointed and feeling left out in the dark as an English reader. While the stories of the transitory characters and the unintelligible Spanish (for me) point to the underlying meaning of the book, they did not make for an engaging read. I also have trouble following the prose. Still, this novel relates all too well to what is often the experience of life change,and I'll keep on with the 3rd book of the trilogy."
3,Ok,Good book but not his best. I loved All the Pretty Horses so thought I would continue with the trilogy but didn't think this one was all that great.
4,Somewhat difficult but well worth it,"McCarthy presents with The Crossing a challenging and hauntingly beautiful novel. I learned much spanish trying to labor through the dialogue and I admit it took much longer to read than most 400 page books. The dialogue, when in English, is understated; the scenery is bleak; and the characters extremely human, sometimes divine. The journey into Mexico is much like Conrad's Heart of Darkness, both physically and psychologically. A book that is hard to forget."
5,Great tortillas and hunger...,"Rich, biblical prose. Gives a great feel for remote, hostile Mexico of the 1800's (and forever?). But where certain civilities are practiced. You might get shot, but if you ride until you're starved you can also ride under an archway into a little hamlet and someone will fry you a tortilla without anyone saying a word. Great shady tequila bar descriptions. Great feeling of a teen getting in over his head and slowly starving while on too long of a ride. Revolutionary chaos description. Only trapping scene in modern lit that I know of. Long, seemingly random digressions...but that also fits the Mexican vibe."
1,Avoid the Kindle edition,"As of 2011-01-31, please refrain from buying Kindle edition. It's full of typographical errors, many of which are disruptive. I've reported many of them to Amazon, who (I hope) will work with publisher to fix ... but until then, stick with hardcopy."
2,Too much Spanish!,"I looked forward to reading this book, since I considered ""The Road"" great and really enjoyed the breath taking description in""All the Pretty Horses""and ""Cities of the Plain."" However, I am so disappointed in ""The Crossing"" I doubt that I will even finish reading it.A major complaint is that there is way too much Spanish. I early on stopped even trying to decipher the meaning and just skipped those passages, which are very numerous and sometimes a paragraph or two in length. What is probably an attempt to provide local color becomes merely irritating for those who do not know Spanish. (And I've yet to figure out what Mr. McCarthy has against punctuation.)The interminable mountains and rivers which, after all, cannot differ much from each other, get pretty tedious after a while, too. As do the stories and philosophizing from people met on the journey. After a couple hundred pages, my feeling is let's get on with it! ( It being the saga of Billy and Boyd.)"
2,Pages out of order?,"Much like his other novels, I initially found the story to be absorbing...very difficult to put down until about 2/3 of the way through I noticed that the end of one page and the beginning of the next were completely out of sync (Vintage International, March 1995 printing). At first I attributed this to McCarthy's unconventional writing style (LOL), but as I read closer I realized that the pages at this point forward are completely out of order. I guess I got one that the quality control guy at the publishing house missed! I just gave up after searching for the place in the book where the pages were back in order, because by that point I was completely lost track of what was going on in the story. Too bad...it really started off as a compelling read. I guess I'll wait for movie adaptation."
3,"Pretty good, but could be better","I didn't like this as much as ""No Country for Old Men."" ""The Crossing"" bears parts that are nearly perfect, and the dialogue among the characters is wonderful, but the stories that the blind man, the priest, and the gypsy tell nearly lost me. Especially the priest."
2,"Depressing, pointless narrative","...A book about random acts of random people. Prose is asoverblown as in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES. Too much geographical detail -the ennui and angst might have been better without the detail - we might have begun to view this in an ""everyman"" light. Part of the story may have been ruled too upsetting, too subversive or too stupid by the editors, who have set it in Spanish so we don't need to pay attention to whatever is happening or whatever the characters are saying.This is better written than ALL THE PRETTY HORSES and slightly riveting, mostly because there is only one point of view. Sadly, the point of view doesn't open on any vista worth seeing or investigating."
3,"Terrific read, when is the English edition coming out?","Loved it (what I could understand of it) but there is simply too much Spanish. As a dam blocks the flow of a river so does half a page of Spanish get in the way of this story, again and again and again. If McCarthy is going for authenticity, why not go all the way and just write the book in Spanish, with English dialogue between the American characters? A show-offy, pretentious device, and for that he loses one star."
4,Cormac's compelling read,"The ""Crossing"", is not Cormac's first book. As such, it is noteworthy for its narrative. It is a dark moody walk through a landscape of people you hope to never meet. Cormac has a style that sets him apart , as all his novels show; notable, Blood meridian, The border trilogy and others. AS a writer of unusual people he can not be topped ! Check him out.."
1,Self-absorbed prophet goes for profit,"This is one of those books that had it not been for the vocabulary would be a high school senior's creative writing assignment. Pompous and overblown, McCarthy often explains what he has just tried to show--like a stand-up comic, he knows everything, notices things we don't and he's going to inform us. ""Look, you're jerks and pseudo-intellectuals--I'll tell you what you need to know."" His favorite author is Melville, his favorite book, Moby Dick. In The Crossing he tries to imitate Melville's style--inserting long passages about technical matters like bull-roping, chain-making, etc. To paraphrase a V.P. candidate running against Dan Quayle, ""Mr. MaCarthy, I have read Herman Melville...and you are no Herman Melville."""
1,CHAPTER ONE WAS GREAT!!,"WOW!! DEJA VU I SAY THIS AGAIN---HOW CAN THIS BE THE SAME GUY THAT WROTE""""THE ROAD""""???? CHAPTER ONE---127 PAGES LONG---WAS REALLY GREAT--REALLY GREAT.THEN AT THE START OF CHAPTER TWO--THE GUY WITH THE CATS STARTS YACKING & YACKING---AND THE POINT IS??----AND YACKING & YACKING----AND THE POINT IS??----AND FOR ?? 30 PAGES ??OR SO THIS GUY IS YACKING AWAY----!!! GET TO THE POINT !!I BROUGHT THE BOOK TO GOODWILL!! I STOPPED READING IT!!! I COULDN'T FINISH.TWO STARS IS ONE STAR TOO MANY."
3,All The Pretty Horses was better,"This one dragged. Slow to get into and slow to finish. The first book in the trilogy was better. It's ""OK."""
1,Confusing piece on AP exam!,A bit about the guy burying the female wolf was used on the 1999 English Literature AP Exam this afternoon. It was horrendous and confusing... 'What is the impact of the event on the main character?' How are we ever supposed to know unless we read the book... Oh well... Guess it can't be that bad... it IS in english.
4,A Slice of American Pie,The Life and Times of a Deco Dowager is a slice of American Pie.The interplay between the architecture and the times shows how the history of an area can be impacted by world events.The Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce carries this book in the Miami Beach Visitor Center because it provides insight into the facinating history of Miami Beach.An easy read for history buffs.
2,Missing much of the history,"I enjoyed the Deco Dowager, as I grew up on Miami Beach and am fascinated by the area and the architecture. What disappointed me in this book, is that the author ended her history of the hotel in the early 50's and didn't pick it up until the 80s.I realize that the area was not in its prime during her ""missing years"" but something certainly must have occurred. Who owned it? What did it look like? What happened there?Certainly the book would have been better served with more history of the hotel (and photos) along with the author's ""potential realized"" with celebrities."
5,"This ""doggles"" are awesome!",Awesome for dogs- even have a little chin strap to hold them on! The XL was too largge though for a 100 pound pitbull. He could have easily worn a large.
3,Doggles !,This are great if you can keep the lens in. This is our third pair and had to glue the lens in due to the others fell out on the road while ridding. Couldn't find where to complain so I guess I will here. Now I know why the lens cost almost as much as the Doggles.
4,Which way to go,"I'm giving this a 4 star, hesitantly, because I enjoyed much of the humor in it (microbrews, Starbucks, WMD) but the story itself was just okay for me. I found it enjoyable enough and liked the subplots and subterfuge going on; however, I also found it highly predictable. I liked the characters presented and yes it is a parody on Hamlet with other stories thrown in but then ""Unhandsome Prince"" was the same way with fairy tales and I enjoyed it much more. I'm not going to run down the plot as other reviewers have done that for us. The book is good enough to read and doesn't require much thought processing. I loved the cracks on footnotes ala Terry Pratchett, et al. As fantasy parody, it's good enough but the market will continue to draw others into it so Moore needs to step up what he's doing. Of the three John Moore books I've read, 'Heroics for Beginners' is my favorite.Overall, good enough to read and enjoy even for the average $7 price tag at your local bookstore."
1,Biased. One-sided. Unbalanced.,"If you even know one _boy_ and are planning to read this book, then fairness demands that you also read ""Failing Boys? Issues in Gender and Achievement"", by Debbie Epstein, Jannette Elwood and Valerie Hey (editors). It was published in April 1999."
3,This book is becoming obsolete....,"...As America continues being one-sided in its attempts, by turning the table on boys... boys are behind in school now. And why? Because they are ignored, after all the attempts to help girls. Why can't we help both sexes in school? Why is it one or the other? School has become increasingly unwelcoming to boys. It is not their fault. Now there are books coming out on this subject. I suggest you all take a look."
1,Completely worthless,"If a girl fails it is blaimed on schools. If a boy fails he has a learning disability. This book uses pitiful data collection methods and bias theories in a vain attempt to make us believe what they are saying. Save your money. If your a man just hate yourself for as long as it would take to get through a 250 page book, and if your a woman feel good about yourself for that amount of time."
4,It's About Time,"I found this book to be quite enlightening in the sense that many do not want to recognize the social injustices that have plagued our society and ignored women's achievements throughout history. Not unlike the achievement gap that exists between poor and minority students and their more priveleged counterparts, it is crucial to address and evaluate the institutional barriers that exist within many school cultures today. Students who are disadvantaged because of biases that impede their emotional, career, and academic development in school and in their life deserve the additional support and attention that will allow them to reach the goals that were once not meant for them. Sadker and Sadker have done an excellent job in demonstrating another facet of accountability that teachers must embrace-that of demonstrating and practicing gender equity in the classroom."
4,Product was as described,The book came in the condition described and when they said it would. The price was great especially because I was buying it for a class.
2,Descent for beginners,"This book reviews the very basics of map design and hardly touches on cartographic representations. It is probably a good starting point for first timers to GIS and mapping, but for the average map maker/cartographer it is too rudimentary."
4,Call it training,"If you analyze data and make maps, this is well worth the money.It helps if you use ArcGIS too...."
1,disappointed,I bought this toner and when I loaded it in my copier....it was giving me a low toner message...I was disapointed ....I will purchase this item from a different source next time.
2,"Well-intentioned, if lacking.","The Kirk Chancel Choir has plenty of spirit and makes excellent efforts on this recording. Ricky Tims put together a capable orchestra to back them up. Still, the choir suffers occasionally from intonation problems, especially during grander passages that require a large sound.Most disappointing, however, is baritone soloist Charles Waldron. His voice sounds strained in the higher register of the Mystical Songs. More troubling is his vibrato, which becomes a pronounced tremolo as the volume and intensity increase."
5,Bic XXL pens,"Wal-Mart, Staples and Office Max seem to have stopped carrying these and I write ALOT throughout the day --my hands don't get tired when I use these pens!!! Great product!!"
3,Don't write Christmas cards with it...,"These pens are great for ""short term"" writing but if you are planning on writing out some Christmas cards, forget it. Where the grip and the hard plastic of the sponge meet near the tip of the pen, it will bear pressure on your finger which will cause discomfort.."
1,Rip OFF,"This is the biggest rip-off I have ever experienced via Amazon. Perhaps it teaches me a lesson not to purchase so much on line. I expected a group of Multi-Ethnic Hispanic dolls-NOT 1 doll which by the way I wasn't given the option to pick out.I have purchased better made dolls for the money I paid for an awfully made one like this one.Shame on Amazon and shame on the dolls manufacturer, it's christmas and their will be a disappointed girl when she sees only one badly made doll."
4,Above Average,"Certainly it does not compare to Edelman's masterpieces, Gettysburg and Dragonheart, but his score to The Hunley is one of his better orchestral works. It stands alone very well and makes for a pleasant listen in the car or around the house."
3,Aims of Argument Book,The Book is in great condition for being used by a few different owners. The pages are not worn and very much serves its purpose.
1,are your serious????,"Mariah Stewart would have you believe that the FBI is handing out condoms and birth control instead of travel vouchers. This is a very predictable book that is purely romance with a mild suspense story wrapped around it to make it a viable entry into the Suspense or romantic suspense genre. The characters are flat and boring and their predictable romp in the sack takes place between pages 338 and 342 of the book, which is about the same for each of these novels. Stewart doesn't seem to take into account that if the FBI was sleeping around nearly as much as she portrays, all of her characters would have been on suspension for misconduct a time or two. But this isn't the only thing she has failed to research. Save your time and money unless you are desperate for this type of mindless dribble in which case you must be a very lonely,repressed, and socially stunted person..."
5,another great book,"Mariah Stewart is my favorite author. Love all her books. The stories, the characters. I read her books out of sequence but it didn't matter. I enjoy them all the same. It's nice that she refers to the same people (i.e. John Mancini from FBI) in different books so you feel that you actually know those people and what they are like. I normally flip through the pages if they are boring but with her book, I read every single word... sometimes more than once. Can't wait to start another one."
2,More like 2 1/2 stars,"This is a great concept for a three book series, but after this first book, I felt unsatisfied with the character development and predictable plot. Mariah Stewart did a great job of writing, though the book wasn't that suspenseful (maybe I've just been reading too much lately). The relationship between Mara Douglas and Aiden Shields wasn't fully developed. I would have liked a few more scenes where they get to know each other, or something just to show the chemistry between the two. I found that seriously lacking in this book.If you want an easy read, get a used copy of this book, but definitely don't pay full price. I'm not going to bother with the other two in the series. This one didn't make me care enough to finish the series."
3,Just a plain book,Albeit the main story is very good it has some flaws:1 How can a professional killer murder one person instead of the right one... three times? I'm just telling you the first chapter.2 How can an FBI agent leave his/her weapon in the car when he/her is on duty?3 How can the police just finish a stakeout because they thought they have the killer?And I can keep on and on but maybe I'll spoil the book.The love story:There really is a love story? Or is just a one night stand straightening to every weekend?
3,Good Enough.,"First, I read the reviews, then I went out and bought the three books in the series (at a half-price book store), and now I've just finished book #1 = Dead Wrong.I only gave this three stars. The book wasn't really a page-turner as some of the other reviewers thought, but I kept reading. It kept my attention long enough to finish the story. I'm hoping Dead Certain and Dead Even are better. This one was just a little too ""calm""."
5,Wrong book being described here,I noticed that the reviews of Bruce Catton's book are actually reviews of Ken Burns PBS Civil War book.Would like to see reviews of the latter book.
3,short history of civil war,THE BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN AND LAID OUT. THE PROBLEM IS IT IS A CURSORY REVIEW OF THE CIVIL WAR WITH NO PARTICULAR DETAILS. IT IS A COMBINATION OF THE AUTHOR'S PREVIOUS BOOKS. IT IS USEFUL FOR SUDENTS OR OTHERS WHO NEED A CRAM COURSE IN THE CIVIL WAR FOR HISTORY CLASS BUT IT IS OF NO PARTICULAR VALUE FOR SERIOUS CIVIL WAR RESERCHERS.
5,American History,I purchased The Civil War on Cd's because my child was reading The Civil War book and it was alittle hard to follow because of not being able to pronounce alot of the words. The Civil War Cd's are word for word for The Civil War book. I would recomend this product to anyone reading The Civil War or learning about the Civil War.
5,Civil War CD,"For Civil War buffs like my father, this came in very handy on his morning and evening commutes. Literally could not stop playing it and currently is listening to it again. It is one of those historical narratives that you could listen to a number of times and hear something new each time."
4,A fine basic summary,"This is a great book to read if you are just beginning to learn about the Civil War. Catton, best known for his biography on Abraham Lincoln, gives an understandable basic summary of why the war started, how it progressed, and how it ended. I wish it would have gone into more detail about the strategy used, but otherwise well done."
4,Duplicate Text,"I would like to pass on to others that the text of this book is exactly the same as the text for Bruce Catton's ""American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War"". I highly recommend the later book as the many illustrations add much to the text."
5,Great Item,I just want to say that the ZVUE is wonderful for my nine year old. This is very easy to work and to get downloads.This is great for any pre teen with the perfect price tag
3,Recommended if you don't listen to A LOT of music...,"The ZVUE is good except that it doesn't come with much space for music and the media cards are expensive so if you're looking to put more than 60 songs on this you're out of luck! (And that's ONLY if you have no videos on it... just one 3 minute music video cut my music time in half!) The screen is big for an mp3 player but the quality isn't that great (think of watching tv with an old fashioned bunny ear antenna, no cable or satellite, that's the video and picture quality). As for battery life it says it lasts ""for hours"" but mine barely made it through an hour and a half! I would throw mine away but then I'd feel guilty cuz my Mom got it for me for Christmas! I'll give it a year for her sake but then I'm buying a different one!"
2,"Ah, no!","This game seems like it would be fun, right? But it comes very short in the story mode with the lame training and the sad submissions. It is so hard to escape a submission, you have a sec, then its over. The stand up is alright, but i would look else where for a fighting game"
1,Boring,"I must have been reading a different book than all of these other people who rated it. I can't say that I should have expected much because I got it for like $3 at the bargains section at Books-a-million. It left SOOO much to be desired!!! I could hardly even get through it, but I'm not one to give up on a book... I wish I had."
5,Informative and amusing.,"Miller's enthusiasm, likes, and dislikes come through in this wonderful guide to West Point. Rather than the sterile descriptions often found in guide books, Miller's love of architecture lets us know honestly how and why any given building is magnificent, or why it' s an abomination (in his opinion). Full of interesting historical and archectural information and well illustrated, it's also humorous in its sometimes blunt appraisals; in short, everything I want from a living, breathing tour guide when on a tour."
2,Bah!,"These guys are just a chip rip-off of Busted, who also suck. This is really just a gimmick; the record companies get a band of teenagers together who can play a couple of chords on their guitars and bass, and a drummer who can keep a basic beat. They get them to look all pretty and spike their hair all nice and purty. They play music that sounds like early Beatles or Beach Boys music, which isn't bad, but they dont have any real style or anything to it."
1,Book never showed up,"I know the book is great because I borrowed it from my local library before ordering it here. Unfortunately, after waiting for over a month my book never arrived. International Books finally issued me a full refund but not until almost two full weeks after I was supposed to receive the book. I will NEVER order from International Books again!"
5,Who's dumb enough not to buy this movie collection?!,"I don't know how much time I spent my time here to serach for this kind CD, and this is the best one I saw yet, and with the original recordings of the songs. It's a MUST HAVE CD for soundtracks lovers!"
3,adorable but broke ...tiny,"I was quite surprised at how tiny the charm actually was. I ordered it for my three year old and it was perfect. She is a petite frame girl and this was small looking on her! However, it is sweet and she loved it right away.The chain (so thin)broke the next day. Replacing this chain will not be easy due to the tiny scale of the charm."
1,terrible,"use something else, possibly a jigsaw. This tool will take you hours to cut with and leave you with sore blistered hands, and most likely an uneven cut that will not be proper sizing for your window to fit."
1,Hands down the worst purchase I ever made!,"Wow, what a hunk of garbage. Won't even cut through most of the 360's case(without heavy sanding) because of the inside of the case. I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone unless they were planning on teaching a shop class to ""special"" kids."
5,A Wonderful Adventure on the Elephant Islands!,"In Ella's second book, more of Ella's island and its occupants are revealed. Ella takes on a challenging errand to help her mother and their bakery that provides a more in-depth view of the island. Beautifully written and illustrated, the character and morals (strong, yet sweet) and fantastic illustrations couldn't be more pleasing. I intend to ""gift"" this book to all of my grandchildren! I love it (o:"
5,A Great New Character in Children's Books,"We are so happy we discovered Ella the Elephant! The illustrations are beautiful and the story here, about Ella and her mother's bakery, is so sweet. Ella sets a great example for little girls--she's smart, a great problem solver, and determined. She also wants to finish what she starts. I love the book as much as my daughter does. She will be getting all the Ella books for her birthday to add to our home library."
5,A Great Read!,This book provides insight into what is really important in life. It helps one focus on the areas of their life where they can make a difference. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to expand their own horizons.
4,"King Crimson-'Live At The Marquee,1969-Collector's-Club 1' (DGM)","Took me quite awhile to finally get my hands on a copy of this CD.This is just one(of several)archived live performances from the band's historic 'In The Court Of The Crimson King' tour.Sound is of acceptable quality.I mean,WHAT else can you expect?Believe some of these 1969 tour CD's might've been made available by fan's home recordings.I listened to this disc a lot when I first got it.Tracks here that make the grade are the frantic opener ""21st Century Schizoid Man"",the intricate ""I Talk To The Wind"",""Epitaph"",a non-lp song ""Travel Weary Capricorn"" and, yet another non-lp song,the eighteen minute ""Trees"". Prime pre-'70's progressive rock&roll here to be fully experienced. Need to be in the 'right mood' to thoroughly enjoy this live CD. A should have."
2,3 bulbs dead in 8 months,"The only thing I like about these bulbs are the hue - not too yellow, not too white.We moved into a LEED certified office a little over 8 months ago. In that amount of time, we've had two of these bulbs go dead in two different (brand new) light fixtures. I removed another dead bulb today and when I shake it, it sounds like there's a piece broken off inside. Not good. There's also a black ring on the inside of the fluorescent tube on both the of dead bulbs and another flickering (almost dead) bulb. We have other brand bulbs (Sylvania & Philips) in the same type of light fixture in this office and none of them are exhibiting these problems. These bulbs are supposed to last for years! We'll be going with the competitor's bulbs from now on."
3,Please get an editor,"The story is interesting and it kept my attention, but the punctuation use and grammar were so bad that they really detracted from the quality of the novel. Quotations marks were used gratuitously and frequently; possessive words were punctuated incorrectly; there were frequent sentence fragments. There were also spelling and factual errors that a good editor would have caught (for example, the blue and gold Purdue pennant, when Purdue's colors are black and gold - since he studied there, I assume it's a typo, but an annoying one given the extent of the Purdue mentions). While errors like this don't mean the story isn't interesting, they do wear down the reader and make the book less enjoyable. This reflects the problem with self-publication quite well.The dream sequences also got a little old, and the ending was kind of a let down in terms of content."
1,disappointed,"i brought this at the same time i got my ipod mini. the latter's great!the case smells very bad. a chemical smell. very strong.also, the part that covers the screen's scratched.im not returning it because i dont have time. if idid, i definitely would.like people already mentioned, it does also bulk to the ipod and wont fit into the belt clip, the screen part does attracts lints, making the screen not as clease as it can be without the case."
4,Functional as it gets,"It's not the prettiest case for my iPod, but who cares? It's going to keep it from scratching/breaking when I eventually drop it! The main selling point for me was that there's also a protective plastic layer over the screen that will protect the screen during collisions as well. Not many (if any) other cases had that. Plus, you can see the colors through the silicone. I thought the pink/blue/green iPods were way too bright for my taste, but this case could easily blunt those colors."
4,Not Up To Normal Standards,"I love Charles Paris and other Simon Brett books, so I did enjoy the book. However I would recommend that those new to the charactors would check out some of the older ones - to have more background and general flavor.I did LOVE IT when Charles tries to salvage his dignity as a performer by playing the part the way he wanted. Very mid life crisis (I guess slightly past). I hope we watch Charles grow extremely old aged."
3,Pretty good if you like various cd's,"Its not a bad cd if you like 80's music, the one hits are really well known and great sounding."
4,Not too bad,"This was the first MP3 player I ever bought. Yes, it only holds about 50-something good-quality MP3 files, but it cost about $30 and fit into my pocket easily while walking/running. I also like the fact that it came with earphones, not earbuds.This would be good if you are a parent and are hesitant about buying your kids a more expensive player that they might break or lose within a month. The only thing I didn't like is having to get batteries (I have an IPod now, so it charges on the computer)."
1,"What an awful, awful product!",This MP3 player worked for less than a month and then became unusable. RCA says it is no longer under warranty even though I purchased it 6 weeks ago! Apparently these are older units which are still being sold but not guarenteed by RCA.
3,Music fan,This recording is not as good as the previous releases that are generally imports. If you really want to hear the Fleetwood Mac of this time period then look for the import releases.
5,You can't help falling for this big green alligator!,"This is a gem of a book,Alvin the alligator is a character you can't help liking, a lot. The illustrations are absolutely hysterical, as Alvin's wild imagination takes the reader to all these wacky situations. Who can't love a big green alligator acting like fred Astaire while he wears dancing shoes, and then later in plain shoes he is seen on the street wearing his casual clothes- including a knit shirt with a human for a logo! I am totally sold on this book and recommend it to anyone with kids of any age (You can always read it yourself!) I am buying a few extra copies to give to friends."
4,Ms. Foreman's Summer Reading Camp,"This is a funny story about an alligator. You have never seen an alligator like this before! The pictures and story are fantastic. If you like to use your imagination, buy this book! It is an awesome book that young children will love to read!"
1,The latest version is not better.,"I should have spent time reading reviews before getting system commander. The only thing they did right was to warn about backing up any important data. Nothing worked the way it was supposed to including the partitioning. The idea sounds great, but it turns out the friend who recommended it had never actually tried the program."
2,When does the hurting stop?!,"You better know what your doing if you use this software. Expecially if you use it with Windows 2000 pro. Problems, problems, how you gonna solve them? System Commander has put me through a living hell. I spent 30 hours just to get System Commander to work with Win98 and Win2000 pro! And when I called LONG DISTANCE to speak with ""customer service"", the only answer I could get is ""I don't know"" and ""Give us a call when you figure it out"" after I remained on hold for TWO HOURS. What is really sad is that these words were spoken by someone who works in System Commander's Technical Support that is an MCSE! Can you believe it? All that studying to get an MCSE so he can tell people ""I don't know"". V-Com (System Commander) better make some changes in their Customer Service and Technical Support Departments or they won't be in business much longer."
3,nice trailer lock,This is a good lock for a trailer or a gun cabinet. The only problem I see is the quality is not as good as the first one I bought years ago. But that's nothing new with things these days. The lock is the same but is much courser and rougher. Not as smooth acting as the older model. But it will do the job just as good.
4,unique and strong music,"I have remembered the music ever since I saw the movie many years ago. The strong, unique, and sometimes stirring music covers a range from sounding classical, to metalic, to light rock, to ethic. A good niche CD for the music collection."
4,Warner's Satin Tux Contour Bra,I purchased 2 of these on sale locally for my teen granddaughter. Sheis so happy with them that she drove over here just to show me howthey look on and how fabulous it made her feel wearing them. So Ipurchased 2 more just now thru Amazon.com. IF you are on the slimmerside (like her) the bras are great! Since they have only a 2 hookback a heavier person like me probably should get something else...LOL
1,model numbers matched but item did not,Should of been an underwire but was not even though the model numbers matched when ordered. So disappointed I just threw it away
1,Doesn't fit,I think buying bra online is risky. The reviews sometimes are not helpful... This bra simply doesn't fit well at all.
3,Maybe not for larger cup size,"Warners Bras have been a success story for me - they're comfortable, durable, and don't make me feel frumpy. However, although I *LIKE* this bra, I would suggest it for smaller cup sizes (I am, sadly, a D *sigh*). The chest band is only two hooks wide (IMHO, the larger cup sizes need at least 3), and the shoulder straps are very narrow, which makes me worry about their staying power for daily use. Plus, the bra doesn't give much ""lift"" which may be due to the fact that it's not an underwire.Please don't think of this as a ding to the bra: as I said, it's nice, comfortable and well-made. But, I think that ladies who *ahem* have a substantial *cough* presence *grinz* should look for something a little more... supportive for the best value."
5,This bra is great!,"I just love this bra. I purchased one at Kohl's recently and after wearing it for awhile, I decided that I had to have several more. My old bras just won't do any longer. The band stays in place (does not ride up), the straps stay put all day, and no wires poking me and leaving marks on my skin. I no longer have to worry about adjusting my bra in public (or private). I would definitely recommend trying on any bra in a store before buying the same online."
2,Disappointed,"I have been desperately searching for a wirefree bra which is also padded... this is a rare combo!! So I was very excited to find this bra. Unfortunately I didn't find this bra very comfortable, but I didn't come to that conclusion until after wearing it for a few hours (and therefore too late to return it.) The cup shape is too pointy for my preference. I do like the satiny material."
1,Katana - Don't buy this software,"Won't install on OS XP Pro, and had one hell of a time trying to install on 98... got it work once."
1,WARNING - Do not Purchase if you have XP Pro,Apparently this item does not work with O/S Windows XP Pro. I have tried for 2 hours to no avail. The Site offers no assistance with this bug. The manufacturer should at least place warning on their packaging that it does not work with a highly popular O/S.Where's the Class Action Suit?
1,Will not work at all!,"Stay away! Just like the other reviewers, it didn't work for me. I tried it on 2 different computers. I bought it on another site--wish I would have tried Amazon first--the reviews would have stopped me."
1,No room for variance,"I found out the hard way that this software only works with the ""pure"" SCP-6600 model Katana. I have Credo Mobile as a carrier and was sent the SCP-6600PL model despite the fact that Credo uses Sprint PCS as their service backbone and Sprint sends out the original model.So if you have a Credo Mobile account, DON'T GET THIS KIT. I'm currently asking Credo which kit will work so I'm afraid I have no suggestions."
5,Very Pleased,Great glasses! I have a larger than normal face and almond eyes. I wasn't sure about the size Maui Jim recommended until I tried them on. They look and feel great. I recived my order quickly and the packaging was spot on perfect! I highly recommend this product.
3,"Love Maui Jim, but the color is more black than Tortoise :(","I love Tortoise colored glasses, so when I lost my last pair of Maui Jim's I got these over the Web. Unfortunately, the color is really more black. Sad!!! Great glasses though, if exact color is not important to you..."
5,A great book.,Read this enlighted book. its so great and a very informative story. It will be a few minutes of your time to read this book.
4,could have been better,This game is a decent fighter but if you aren't a fan of k-1 then you won't know who the fighters are. Also the game can get very hard so it is best to work your way up the ranks.
3,its not good not bad... ok,i have purchased this item because its was on sale. But for the actual price is not worth of buying it. over all as a sale deals its ok to have.
3,Nice shoe at the right price,"Michael Toschi makes wonderful shoes, but the catch is...they are expensive. You are paying for the shoe and not the brand name. I had never heard of ""Michael Toschi"" until a shoe clerk recommended them. The Toschi ""Balboa"" slip on is the best shoe I have ever owned or worn. So, when or if a different Toschi shoe hits my price range, I'm game to try it. The Navy SUV2 is a good 3 star shoe for me. It is a tad bit narrow for my foot, so it does not have the ""walk on the cloud feel"" that my Balboas have. Works great with jeans and casual Friday's at work. I've received some nice compliments on them. If they were little wider, I would give them 4 stars. For comparison, the Toschi's Balboas I would give a highly recommended 5 star rating."
3,"Great songs, bad sound.","I was hoping for this to be a great cd. In theory it should be. All of the songs selected are great songs by Sykes. Being that this was a Japanese release, I expected the sound quality to also be good. Unfortunately, the sound quality is pretty poor. Unless you are a completist and just have to have this cd (like myself), save your money on this collection and pick up the individual cd's."
5,Outstanding product for curly hair!,Leaves my hair feeling soft and natural and makes it hold the curl really well. I love it! Have gotten numerous compliments on how nice my hair looks.
2,Its pretty but...,Its a very pretty ring but within days of receiving it the coating wore off it to show the brass underneath.. Not happy at all! Rated 2 stars because it is very pretty
2,"Same Old stuff, different package.","I have seen some very good WWI war documentaries however this was not one of them, it will put you to sleep which is not a bad thing if that is what you're looking for. I was reading a review for another DVD and the person made the comment ""you get what you pay for"" well this is a clear example of that, even for the low price I would not purchase this DVD again. Yard sale."
5,firewire cable,This cable works great. It is not stiff as someone else said. It is long enough to use easily. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one!
2,10 foot - Not 6 foot,Description states 6-footPackage and actual length was 10 footOther than that it works fine
5,Does what it says for a good price,"I was a little worried after reading the review that the cable was stiff, but when I got mine, it was actually a very flexible cable. It also has a nice texture to it. It came exactly as pictured. All the connectors fit well into my ports. It works, there are no flaws that I can see, it shipped super fast, and the price is great. That's all I care about."
4,good cable at a good price,"I have no complaints about this product. It is inexpensive, it worked as advertised. The cable seems fairly sturdy although I haven't subjected it to any extreme tests. It was also shipped quickly, and with all things considered it was a good purchase."
2,Frustrating edition,"I really enjoy the short stories of Saki, but I wouldn't recommend this edition. It is poorly formatted in terms of navigation. One can only get to the table of contents by first going to the cover. Then it is possible to access the contents for the various volumes. if, however, you were to go to ""Beasts and Superbeasts"", for example, you would find an elaborate completely non-functional list of the stories in that volume. Getting to a specific story would require guess-work.I'm returning my copy and will pay a bit more money for a better edition."
5,"Saki is a master of the concise, witty, dark short story","He says in 4 pages what others might say in a 100 - and better. Apart from the wit, a peep into a vanished world of edwardian elegance. Black comedy of a very high order (warning: this edition could be better formatted)"
3,Good book poor navigation,I enjoy the stories however the navigation on this book is exceptionally poor given that you had to pay for it.I would suggest looking on Project Gutenberg for the stories. I normaly prefer to pay a few dollars for better navigation but this was not the case in this instance.
5,Absolutely the Best,"This THE fashion book.Before this book, I was tangled up in concerns about dressing for my figure line, color profile, body weight , etc., etc... After Metamorposis, all that flew out the window! Thanks to David, I have stopped letting my penchant for Victoriana cause me to stifle myself in unflattering frills (my category is 'soft natural'), and my idea of dressing sexy is no longer tight waistlines and clingy fabrics.Be forewarned that Metamorphosis may dispel some of your most cherished ideas about your clothing style, but only those which obscure your individuality and ultimate style potential. In return, you will obtain the knowledge and courage to express yourself like you probably never have before.The one problem, I admit, is the book's age. While the basic tenets are timeless, the model's fashions are not, and it would really help if David could cover today's changing fashion scene.I agree--a sequel is badly needed.Where are you David?!"
3,Total concept approach to image,"Fairly sophisticated approach to ""total concept"" in apperance. The ideas are original and effective, presenting a conceptual approach to image. The system would work for anyone, with any assets and limitations. The concepts take some mental energy to personalize, but the system seems worth the effort. One could save a bundle on mistaken purchases by using these concepts. More visuals would be helpful, and some of the ideas left me curious as to what was actually meant. None the less, more interesting and broad in scope than the typical fashon book."
5,A treasure of a book--why is it out of print?,"This is the only book on style and fashion that you need. It's been immensely helpful to me. I've changed my entire way of dressing and it's a lot easier to buy clothing that looks good on me. I can make catalog or online purchases without trying things on and immediately know what I can and cannot wear. David Kibbe is a genius. And he doesn't ""make you over""; he helps you express and bring out what you already have."
1,Where are the New Age clips?,"what a disappointment this is, this is just a collection of classic rock.....none of the opera or new age music used on the show is here..."
3,Strange Island,"Whisper Island is a mystery romance film. The problem with the mystery is it's very hard to solve when supernatural things are involved that you don't know the rules of. Some people must love that sort of thing. Others of us don't. To me, without rules, this is strange. Don't get me wrong, the characters are interesting and fun, but the rest is, well, less so."
3,I'm a fan but...,I'm a fan but I wouldn't make this the first purchase if you want to get some WASP. Not horrible but unless you're a hardcore metal fan trying to expand your collection I would skip.
4,Great book for primary age readers.,"This is a wonderful story that will bring tears to your eyes. One crooked little tree is left all alone on the Christmas tree farm after everyone has come to choose their special tree. He tries to find out what is so special about being a Christmas tree and why he is not ever good enough for that title. Then one day the little crooked tree is dug up and taken to a new home. There he discovers how special he is and what it feels like to be a Christmas tree, not just one year but for many years to come."
5,70's Japanese psyche rock weirdness,"With a name like ""Flied Egg"" you know you're in for somethin' different and this delivers that in spades! Kinda proggy psyche rock with some great proto-metal riffs is the order of the day here,served thru a Japanese filter that adds to its uniqueness.Yea its kind of weird,but its pretty catchy and fairly heavy in spots for its time.Flied Egg remain one of my favorite early 70's Hard Rock bands."
1,"dreadful video ""quality""","Terrible, choppy playback.We have very fast internet and wifi in our house. No reason at all for the quality to be soooooo bad.Stick with Netflix for streaming."
4,young kids dig this,"Well the kids love it, I can not take the music myself on some of the episodes, however the kids like these songs. You will find yourself sinigng them even when the show is not on and your are far away from them."
5,Absolutley Amazing!,"Awesome. This is indeed a strange game at first but after 20 minutes you'll be hooked. After playing RTS's for the PC like Starcraft, Emperor:Battle for Dune, and the like, I got Goblin Commander as a Christmas gift. There are 5 clans in the game:the valiant Stonekrusher, brave and quite humorous Hellfire, magical Stormbringer,insidious Plaguespitter, and of course, the evil Nighthorde. You start out with Stonekrusher but end up controlling all of the clans. A good tactic with multiple clans is tough melee troops(Stonekrusher, Nighthorde) and devastating ranged units in back (Hellfire, Plaguespitter, Stormbringer). Different clans excell at different areas, for example Hellfire is excellent at ranged warfare (Hunters and Bombardiers absolutley shred other units) but are poor at melee, quite opposite from Stonekrusher. A goo game overall with a reallly great multiplayer mode! I beat the game in about 12 hours the first tim I did it, pretty long."
3,Wierd...,"This game is fun...ish. It's very, very strange an d kindaa funny... really, unless you like goblins, you should not spend alot of time with this game. In other words: RENT IT FIRST!!!"
4,Repetitive,"Can't say much besides try it out. It falls as other people say into the easy to learn, difficult to master category. I'm stuck on act 4 (Plaguespitters) but I had enough fun getting there."
4,get yours for $16 at EBgames,O.K. this is a good game with great controls and an awesome multiplayer and as my offer to you ill let you in on a secret to get it for $16 (but it is used at EBgames) go to EBgames and put the used Goblin Commander into your cart. put in this special password QT4ER4BSI and get $10 off automatically then just select the limited edition free shipping EBsaver and you get your copy of goblin commander for $16 with no shipping.
3,"Ms. Maggert, gifted with an exceptional voice, needs a producer.",This album seems to have simple accompaniment and straight forward rendering of some very beautiful songs. Sometimes her voice sounds reedy when it is unfiltered by an accompanying instrument or good soundboard enginerring Orchestration could set these performances in a much more dynamic setting. This is what a producer could do. Diana Kral had Tommy Matola. Barbara Streisand had Dwight Hemion. Maude Maggert is ready for a strong visionary producer to present her to the music world at large.
4,reissue,"This is a re-issue of an earlier album. It is excellent music (although the re-issue gives Grieg credit for a piece by Saeverud). The CD cover art is different so don't be fooled into buying it twice, as i was."
2,Not really there yet!,The best part about this game is in fact the cars and what you can do to them. I had the best time pimping up my ride for the contest and that is pretty much as good as it gets. They should hook up with the people who make the Need For Speed Games and then make it really about the cars. Give us some more rims to choose from or something. This game looks and feels like something nintendo put out in the early 90's. Lets up the fun and bring the game into 2004. They should re-design the hole thing and re-release it with a bang! They need to do for Lowriding what Need For Speed Underground is doing with those euro cars!!!!!!
4,lowrider game,"This Game ISN'T the best ,but lets face it,it's THE ONLY ONE O ITS KIND. it's fun to play for a while but it could be a lot better. i have always dreamed that Rockstar or some other big name would TEAM UP with LOWRIDER MAGAZINE and make this game all it can be or better but that still has not happened...YET. maybe someday SOMEONE WILL, BUT UNTIL THEN THIS GAME IS FUN.4 outa 5"
4,iffie,"If your into high bouncing get-em-up cars. this game is for you. I liked going to diffrent competitions with my lowie and bouncing her a$$ in peoples faces as they cheared me on... but the length of gameplay is shortend by lack of storyline or anything of the sort. I seemed to get board with it after about 3 and a half hours or so. However, it earned all 4 stars fully. its a great game, fun to play and if you drive em low, youll love it!"
3,Flimsy but Affordable,"This tape is fairly thin and it takes some effort to peel it off without the strip tearing into separate shreds. If you're looking for a durable fool-proof masking tape that will take some abuse, this is NOT for you. However, if you don't want to spend $10 on a roll of tape for a minor project, this'll get you by."
2,Insomnia Cure,"I'm a Sunday School teacher and was looking for something to supplement a lesson on Noah's Ark. This looked interesting, so I bought it without review. The cinematography is nice, yet if you're looking for a good re-enactment of the three Genesis stories you should look elsewhere. I gave it two stars as it does stay close to Scripture.The story is narrated with brief and ""low budget"" portrayals of the three stories. Much of the film shows a nomad (Beduoin?) family seemingly from the time the stories were actually written. Seeing people sitting in tents or around a campfire while an old man narrated was not compelling. Wife was snoozing after ten minutes, while husband had to fight gamely to make it to the end, though there's a good probability some portions were missed."
4,Works as Advertised,"I've been using this for a few months now and I've not had a problem with it. It charges my shuffle very quickly - generally in about 10-20 mins., depending on the level of charge needed.I have not had a problem with this frying the shuffle either.The only complaint, and this is minor, might be that like a cell phone charger, it might interfere with radio reception a little bit, depending on the station too though.Otherwise, I'm glad I found this product. It's inexpensive and works. What more can you ask for?"
4,Handy To Have When The Player Is Almost Out Of Juice While In The Car,"My fiance bought me this for Valentine's Day. I'm a sucker for functional gifts, especially when they are things like chargers or cases for something. This is for my matchbox ipod 2nd Generation. It's very handy and I'm able to leave it in the car and have it just in case my player dies. I like to listen to it a lot and rarely have time to leave it jacked into my computer to charge it. Very handy."
1,Junk,This item was a piece of junk that destroyed my Ipod!Do not buy.I only gave 1 star because you had to.
4,Check Out Fred Neil!,"I first heard The Dolphins on the Soprano's, and took notice immediately. The remainder of the CD is also worth it. This guy was extremely talented, and worked with some of the best in the industry. Check out FredNeil.com...very interesting."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"The floor plan prints are hard to read, very small print and often blurred. Aside from the quality of the floor plans the writing while sometimes interesting, is often too vague."
4,An interesting look at how people live,"If you live in New York City, this is a great book to see what the building ""insides"" look like. Although I don't live there, I still enjoyed seeing the floor plans and getting a very brief descriptive of each building. Just a fun book to look at and imagine yourself living in one of the more grand one-floor coops or condos. Fun to dream! The only downside is that some of the floor plans were so small that I needed a magnifying glass to identify the room layout."
2,New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments,"I was expecting photos, not only floor plans in black and white, that's why i was disappointed. But i will read it."
3,Beans - Now Soon Someday,"Beans sets his dextrous lyrics out to play withNow, Soon, Someday. The IDM-style bleeps and bloops of ""Structure Tone"" shows that he's just as interested in the sounds behind him as the sounds he himself makes -- the track ends on a note of pure abstraction. El-P's mix of ""Mutescreamer"" gives the track a little electro nudge, while Prefuse 73 somehow makes the track melancholy and finger-snapping. He returns to his own weird take on Detroit techno with ""Databreaker"" and ""Composition in Void"" while ""Gold Skull"" goes deeper and darker, with sparser lyrics. Prefuse 73 returns with an instrumental mix of ""Phreek the Beet,"" which is like an acid flashback to the 80s. Pretty freaky, indeed."
3,"Not as good, or as bad as the others say.","Band of Angels: the acting is passable, not fantastic, but fair enough for a B-Movie. The sets & costumes are wonderful to look at, which is the main reason I'm giving this one 3 stars. The story is entertaining to the end, so in that respect, this is worth seeing at least once. The one actress holding this movie back was Yvonne de Carlo. She's much too old for the part, and not at all believable as being ""mulatto"" or ""quadroon."" At times its painful watching her struggle with her lines. They should have cast an actress who was truly of mixed-race to play the part, and a much younger one at that. Then maybe this film would sing the way it was intended. Overall Band of Angels struck me as a dime-store romance novel transported to film."
3,"wannabe ""Gone with the Wind""","If you like the time period of the movie, you will probably enjoy this. I liked it. Maybe not as well as Gone with the Wind, but it entertains."
1,Painful Movie,"It was pure agony watching this horribly overly melodramatic, wretchedly acted film. The story line was jumbled and veered off all over the place - completely disjointed and messy. The characters were half fairy dust and half bombasity. It was astounding to see such reknown actors reduced to high school theatrics. Clark Gable did the best he could with the trite dialogue and silly scenarios. Sidney Poitier was excellent and admirably portrayed the black anger of the 1950's that this film is really about. If you could only watch his scenes (minus the awful dubbed singing)it could be somewhat worthwhile. I finally turned the film off before its oh so timely end."
4,More Than I Expected.,Quintessential Gable... I found the movie quite evocative - given the distorted ethics of the day - and quite surprising that the plot was as honest as it was.
2,STAR SYSTEM IN ACTION,"This movie is a classic example of big contract stars struttung their routine stuff. Probably most of its budget went on casting Clark Gable; it is his presence that would've compelled the movie audience to go see it. To give it a decent rating would be like rating a local TV new bulletin. It's not good, it's not bad; it does its job. BAND OF ANGELS kept more innocent moviegoing audiences of its day sufficiently enthralled to make it a success. For those reasons- and its color and technical proficiency- it is a historical record of Hollywood dishing 1950 punters, and Gable fans, with what they thought wanted to see that week."
4,Rhett Butler full grown,"I like this film for 4 different reasons. I very much like the type of man that Clark Gable played and I think became. This is a tale of redemption, an interracial love story, and as one review wrote perhaps the clearest protrayal of blacks in the US of A that has been seen on film.This shows a former sea captain, a former slaver, a very wealthy adult living in New Orleans at the outbreak of the War Between The States Who for some reason pays a fortune for a young mulatto girl off of the slave block. Take her home, and does not have sex with her. This is a story of a gentleman who is not a pussy.This movie shows that once Clark Gable played a part, that part would always be his whether it is in a film or a book."
4,A Film Ahead of Its Time,"It would be interesting to know how audiences reacted to this movie when it was first released in 1957. I never knew that African slaves got packed into ships like sardines until I saw the miniseries ""Roots,"" yet in this movie Clark Gable reveals the shameful story of how Africans were captured (sometimes with the help of other Africans) and packed into slave ships, and how cruelly they suffered. It is like seeing the other side of Rhett Butler, a very dark side. I don't consider this movie to be so much a romantic story as it is a story about forgiveness and the hope of a new and better era. I never knew that Sidney Poitier and Clark Gable had been in a film together, and it is a treat to see two such great actors confronting each other. Poitier plays his character superbly--he is rightfully impatient for freedom and justice, yet he knows he has to watch his step or else he will be crushed. ""Gone with the Wind"" seems very shallow compared to this movie."
4,Band of Angels,"I saw Band of Angels with Clark Gable & Yvonne DeCarlo many years ago & I was very moved by it! It wasn't Gone With the Wind but I thought it was very good!R. Roeder (Reading, Pa.)"
5,BAND OF ANGELS,"iT IS ONE OF THE BEST CLARK GABLE MOVIESIN MY ESTIMATION.THE ACTION IS GREATI LIKED IT SO MUCH,I DECIDED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND BAND OF ANGELS TO ALL WHO LIKE CLARK GABLE ACTION MOVIES."
5,Best Value among similar teleconverters.,You must be careful about compatibility with your particular digital camera but this teleconverter works well with nearly all Olympus digital cameras and all Panasonic cameras manufactured before the end of 2005 (many others of all brands also but these are the ones I'm sure of). Note that you need an adapter in some cases. This item has 55mm threads. The only competitor generally thought to have slightly better quality is the Nikon TC-E17ED and it costs 4 times as much.
4,Olympus Teleconverter Lens,This teleconverter works well with a Panasonic Lumix FZ18 camera - nice to have 30+ optical zoom.
3,As Good As Telephoto Gets With an Olympus Zoom Camera,"This lens about doubles the telephoto magnification of an Olympus zoom lens digital camera. However, that isn't a lot of gain considering the cost of this item and the required adapter rings, plus the hassle of putting this lens on and taking it off. It does provide a bit more mileage out of your Olympus zoom camera and would be a good buy at about half the price."
3,Pretty Good for the LX3,"So I got this for my LX3. It is kinda big and clunky so it doesn't go out with me a lot. If you are using it, you will have to use the EZ zoom on the LX3, this will reduce the quality of the photo. But for the deduction in the quality of the photo with this 1.7 zoom, you get more reach for the cut in quality. For some shots there is no other way. If i had to do it all over again, I would have gone forward in time to now, buy the LX5 with more zoom, then go back to 2 years ago with my LX5 with more zoom. I mean it is still a high quality piece of equipment, and I can't complain since I have some awesome shots that I could have never taken with it. But for the LX3, I wouldn't get it."
3,Quite informative,"This book arrived in good time and was well packaged. It was quite informative but because the subject matter was so broad I didn't feel it concentrated enough on elaborating on the names listed. The writer resorted to listing the families with too brief a background. I have found a better book for me, personally, since travelling to Cork in Southern Ireland. It was far too expensive for the small amount of information the book contained."
1,Strange Book,"Is this research? Is it a long statistical essay? Or is it an agenda-laden piece of you know what? Has Mr. Greene ever spent a second in front of a real classroom? He criticizes Jonathan Kozol referring to his writing as ""anecdotal"" and not research-based. OK. But at least Kozol has done some 'real"" leg work and visited schools in poverty stricken areas all over the US and speaks with the kids, parents, teachers, and principals. Plus, Kozol is a talented writer. Reading this book, however, one gets the feeling that Mr. Greene has been hanging with the high set rather than the homeboys.The chapter where he contends that there is no evidence demonstrating that smaller class size has educational benefits is pretty laughable. Ask anyone who has ever taught both small versus large classes. There is no comparison.Come on, Jay, even you can't believe what you've written, deep down."
1,Propaganda,"I have never read such bull**** in my life. As an educator with her recent Masters in Education, I debunk Greene's theories. I suggest reading actual research done by Phd's and educators such as: A.R. Sadovnik; H. Kohl; R.P. McDermott; J. Bettie, M.A. Gibson; M. Polluck; Fine, Weis, & Powell; R. Rist; J. O'Neil .....to name a few. When Jay Greene has read from all of the experts above, spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative, caring, open-minded teacher, and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds, then he can write a book about schools. Our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals, yet Greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader's think that education is something as simple as a broken toy. In fact, education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers: something Greene does not want his readers to do."
1,Academically This Book Never Should Have Found a Publisher,"Greene's methodology is horrible. The entire book is based on a strawman. He creates ""myths"" which he himself puts into words and defines. This makes it simple for him to prove them wrong, even when there's no evidence that the Common Man actually subscribes to these myths.His definitions for the myths and how to find them true are false are tautological. They are worded in ways so that the outcome is already assured. I am unsure how the first draft of this ever made it past an editor.Regardless of whether you want these myths to be ""true"" or ""false,"" please find the answers in a better written and more credible source than this."
4,Excellent Discussion of Why the Conventional Wisdom on Education is Wrong,"""Education Myths"" is one of those ""love it or hate it"" books. Liberals who have bought into these myths will despise the ""reality checks"" Greene gives while conservatives will applaud his meticulous debunking of them. Are schools underfunded? Are teachers underpaid? Do smaller class sizes raise student achievement? Does teacher credentialing result in better performance? Do vouchers work? Greene reviews the research on these and other ""hot button"" issues to demonstrate that the conventional wisdom is very often wrong."
5,Thank you Mr. Greene,"Jay P. Greene has an agenda: the beginning of a modern system of public education. Wake up America, we need change in Public Education and Greene is right on point. Some of his points can be offensive (to teachers), but sometimes the truth hurts. Everyone agrees there exists a problem, and when Greene asks the reader to look at the facts that lead to the roots in order to get to the solution, I am inspired that there is hope.We all have agendas in life that govern the decisions we make from the time we wake to the time we sleep. Some of the agendas we choose in life are selfish and regressive for our great country. We can only hope that more are interested in progress. Greene is a true American who has put the progress of his country at the front of his agenda. ""Education Myths"" is clearly written from the hearts and minds of men who care and I look forward to reading more from Greene and others from his school of thought."

5,Breaking the Chain,Really enjoyed this book. Story line was suspenseful and kept the reader guessing until the end. Good job to the author and thank you for sharing this book on amazon.
5,Awesome !!,"No doubt that this single marked the Big Five come back. Yes, their back together again!! And its really really a great single ever!! It's like the old days coming back again.... back to the glorious era of Duran Duran. Its a must have single to all duranies all around the world!! Its a very Duran Duran's style which combined Nick's touch with all the Taylors' style along with the sexy voice of Simon!!"
3,Sunrise--very good! Know it all---FLAT!,"I just bought the single for the Know It All song that is not on their Astronaut album. While Reach Up for the Sunrise is very good and sounds like it was recorded in an arena in front of thousands of fans, I didn't like Know it All. Know is just eerie sounding and more of an instrumental song, with one member singing over a vocoder. Sometimes, you hardly know what they are singing in the song. I can see why they left it off of the Astronaut album, where the 12 songs on there are very superior. So while you're dancing to Sunrise, skip the CD button on Know it all. It sounds flat."
3,IT'S O.K!!!,"A fun and lovely read but that is all!It didn't move me like "" divine secrets of the ya-ya's"" and certainly didn't ""stay"" with me.I didn't think all characters were fully developed and Laurie Graham rushed the story...like she had other places to go.In my opinion there was great potential here...such a shame that she didn't take the time to let the characters grow on you!"
2,"Oh, Please","The characters were largely interchangeable -- it was hard to keep track of who's who. Having grown up in the deep south in roughly the same time period, I found it hard to believe that high school graduates (including a top scale wedding consultant) run around saying ""I seen..."" ""Me and her went.."" and ""She brung... Very grating."
4,"This is a nice, comfortable read.","I had my doubts when I first started this book. It starts out really slow as Graham sets up the characters, but it all unfolds very beautifully.This story is about five Airforce wives... Peggy, Betty, Lois, Audrey and Gayle and follows their lives through divorce, death, children and numerous moves. It is told in the voice of Peggy, who is the glue that holds the clan together.This book is light, funny and very easy to believe. I give it four stars because it wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, but it was obviously worth the time to read it. Very entertaining."
4,Good Fun,This book was a lot of fun. I really got into the story and couldn't but the book down. It was our October book club book. I would have never read it if it weren't for this book club. I really enjoyed the story and wanted to know what happened to these ladies next.
4,Well worth the read,Somehow I picked up this book at the bookstore and once I got it home I couldn't put it down. The novel progresses through the friendships of women and their struggles. The ups and downs of life. Just a wonderful book that shows how special friendships are.
1,Still have not recieved,"I borrowed this book from a friend as I still have not received it from the company I purchased it from. With that being said. This book was not my style. I don't know if was based on real life events or if was pure fiction, either way I was bored. If you like reading about the interpersonal relationships of women who only get together because their husbands (or in Kath's case, pure chance) are in the military, then this is the book for you. On the plus side, it is a pretty quick read."
2,Could have been very good,"A decent story about several American women and their individual and connected lives starting on a military base in England and thereafter. However, the book was severely hampered by the British author's portrayal of several Americans as ill-spoken, barely educable dolts. Also, some poor editing and the author's lack of research was jarring. For instance, she has a character in early 1960's USA who has Hubba Bubba bubble gum - a product not introduced in the USA until the 1970's."
2,Not worthy of your time,My book club met last pm to discuss. 7 of 8 women were very disappointed by the quality of the author's writing as well as its negative portrayal of Americans. Would not recommend it!
1,Check for phone support before buying,"Go to their website and see how much support the software offers for your particular phone. For my LG PM-325, this package is not really worth it. It can download the phone #s off my phone. But it can't retrieve my ringtones nor can I upload ringtones to the phone. It can get pictures from my phone but it cannot upload to the phone. Kind of pointless with such limited features.Worst part is the length of time it takes to update the software. Its ridiculous as one writer wrote having to upgrade each incremental update yourself (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.....3.11)."
1,Horrible Tech support,I had problems from the start with this product. After emailing tech support all they did was repeatedly quote solutions that were on their website FAQ's (which I had already tried and notified them of that in my email). They chose to ignore my subsequent emails telling them that none of their solutions worked. They kept trying to close the ticket without finding out if their solution worked for me. I have had the ticket open for a month and still no response even after sending follow-up emails to them.Stay away from this product and anything made by Susteen!!!
1,Not worth the time or money,"I recently purchased this cable and software for my LG phone. Worked fine moments after install, then lost connection to phone. Only after a re-install did it work again, and that was momentarily as well. Now not able to use software at all. Definitely a rip off."
1,Stay Away!!,"This is horribly written software. Difficult to install. Half the features it says it has don't even exist. No contact sync, no calendar sync. Won't recognize mp3 files. Midi conversion program sort of works but is garbage."
4,Bridget's Review,"Both his father and grandfather have passed away and now Richard II, who is just a boy, is the new King of England. Being a child he was only able to rule with the Regency Council. As he grew to be a teenage, the council was null and he was able to make decisions for his people as he saw fit. He also fell in love and took a wife, Anne of Bohemia at this important time in his life.There are so many things that happen in this book. King Richard's life is like a roller coaster. There's drama, romance, murder and more. This is a fun fictional portrait of King Richard II."
2,As warned the chorus is much louder than the featured performers,I have had the pleasure of hearing this on vinyl and the voices of the main performers are clear with the chorus in the background as expected.It was highly disappointing that this version buries the interesting performances under the chorus. One of the main reasons for buying this on CD was to have a quality recording of similar stature but for some reason this mix has the purpose backwards highlighting the chorus at the expense of meaning.Avoid this if you ever heard the first recording or would like to hear the lyrics and the solo performers.
4,Unusually brilliant................,"This is a bizarre and relentless opera-as the surreal title implies, more dream than drama. Where the earlier recording had an abrasive edge, this new one is more refined, melding the different elements, electronic alongside acoustic, more subtly and persuasively than before. Even so, the first train episode, over 20 minutes long, remains mind-blowing in its relentlessness. The impact is heightened by the vividness of the recording, with spoken voices in particular given such presence that they startled me as if someone had burst into my room. The vision remains an odd one, but with a formidable group of vocalists and instrumentalists brilliantly directed, often from the keyboard, by Michael Riesman, the new recording certainly justifies itself."
1,never worked,"Never could get this game to play on my windows 7 laptop. After dowloading fixes and patches and changing registry entries,still never worked.Money wasted..."
4,A sweet book,"This book was special because of the unique sweetness of the heroine, Becky. Young and childlike, with a quick temper and a soft heart, Becky is unlike the majority of the women in romance novels. She is never domineering or flirtatious, but, rather, adorable. She is the reason this book is worth reading."
3,Not for me,I couldn't get past the youth (17!) and childishness of the heroine which turned me off. Everybody seemed too overwrought. I give it a thumbs down.
4,Works as Expected,Happy with purchase. Worth every penny. I bought this to use for connecting a field recorder to the sound engineers equipment at weddings to record speeches directly from the mic remote.
4,Works as it should,Stone works just fine and aerates well. Cost was a little higher than I would have liked but was ordering a bunch of things so I threw it in. Cheaper at Walmart but no big deal.
3,Not exceptional but informative,"This video was worth the purchase, though I was disappointed in it in some ways. While I enjoyed learning about the nation's economy, two largest cities, architecture, and so forth, it sorely lacked a colorful portraiture of the national chararcter. I have never been to Sweden, nowhere close to it, but from what I've always heard and read about it the people there seem to be honest, hardworking, charmingly shy people, the type of which there should be more of in the world. True, learning about the natural resources and the Laplanders was interesting, but the part that showed the different meats of the Smorgasborg, while informative, made me wish they would investigate national traits instead--the few interviews conducted gave the impression that these are a peaceful, loving, sweet people, in sharp contrast to their Viking ancestors. This is still worth a buy, though, for anyone interested in learning about this scenic, charming, and peaceloving nation."
1,Not Available???,"Sounds like an interesting story - one I would like to read. The fact that has been made not available for Australia however, disappoints me. There does not appear to be a good reason for this decision - at least not one that has been communicated.Due to this I will now not purchase other works by this author.Actually the 1 star rating was given as I must select a rating - personally I would have given -2 if I could have!"
3,FRESHWATER ROAD,Good book with insights into a young CIVIL RIGHTS worker's struggles. I felt the ending could have been stronger and deeper.
4,Engrossing!,I really enjoyed this story of Freedom Summer in from the standpoint of a college student from Michigan and the people she meets while attempting to register blacks to vote and run a freedom school for the black children of small-town Mississippi in 1962.
4,Freshwater Road,This book brought the Civil Rights movement to my attention. Having lived thru that period and having read news articles about the happenings I continued to be amazed at what went on enabling the black folks the right to vote.
5,Freshwater Road is right and accurate,"As a southern woman, I know what she wrote was right and accurate. I could feel the red dirt between my toes."
4,"Tense and gritty, Freshwater Road is a must read for any American","This book takes you on a journey you will be so thankful you never had to endure in real life, and feel sorrow in your bones for those who did. In places I found it hard to breathe. I wanted to believe I was reading fiction, when all the while I was sad because it wasn't. Heart breaking, but all I could think was, it DID change. It took too long, but it did change, praise God."
2,Just too boring,"I had high hopes for this book. I really did. It had gotten great reviews, and I had recently read The Help, which is also about race relations and that kind of thing, and is in my Top 5 of all time. I loved the interactions between The Help characters, and the character and story development, the pacing of the book, etc.Freshwater Road could not have been more different. Talk about plodding along. I realized at one point, characters had not spoken to each other in 30 or so pages. Just page after page describing the heat and bugs and sweat....Why no closure to the Sissy story ? I also didn't get how Celeste mentally accused Mr. Tucker of molesting and murdering Sissy. Just because someone is opposed to Freedom School, and I gather a lot of local people were opposed to it, doesn't mean the person is a pedophile and murderer.I had to force myself to finish this."
4,Freshwater Road,"This book was as entertaining as it was informative. I felt I was right there in hot, hot Mississipi summertime. The author's unique use of words added interest as well. I thought the book very well written and look forward to reading more from this author."
4,Puts you right into the book.,"Purchased from Amazon.I am in the process of reading this book and, so far, must give it high marks.The author's writing is such that you feel what she feels, smell what she smells,fear what makes her afraid. Denise Nicholas has certainly done a beautiful jobof taking you back to that time when a ""Negro"" had many things to fear and learned not to expect much. Her characterizations are absolutely amazing and you feel you come to know the people that she is describing. That is an amazing talent! I still have much left to read, but did not want to miss this chance to give her 4 stars in order to encourage others to give this book a chance.When I finish, I may want to write another review. Perhaps I can give it 5 starsat that time.P.A. Woodard"
5,Very good book.,"EXCELLENT. Couldn't, put it down. Very interesting perspective on the south in the 60's. Hard to imagine that sort of attitude."
4,Thoughtful well written book,Well written enjoyed book very much. Civil rights era e work. The author kept me coming back for more! Descriptive and concise.
2,A long ride to nowhere,Each page gave me hope for more....but in reality I glanced at my Kindle to see I was halfway the and still nothing significant had taken place. I finished the book but the story never had any meat to it. It's a shallow dance into a dark and violent period in our history as African Americans seek the right to vote in the sixties. How could the author not make this story more gritty? I feel like the main character didn't grow up or change. She left her world to help with voter registration but still never broadened her world. Disappointing book.
2,Historically interesting,"Worthy of reading for its historical perspective on the civil rights movement in the 1960's South. As a work of fiction, the story doesn't really go anywhere. The author attempts to tie in the main character's family life, but doesn't quite get there."
5,Civil Rights Movement Made Relevant and Real,"Denise Nicholas truly brings history to life in this novel based on her own experiences as a young college student involved in the Civil Rights activities known as Freedom Summer. It took incredible courage for youngsters, both black and white, to spend a summer in the deep South, trying to register black voters to vote for the first time. Even though they'd been legally able to vote, Negroes were intimidated and frightened, even beaten to prevent them from voting. Denise takes us inside that time and helps us understand what that was like. It left me deeply moved."
4,A story not yet at ended.,"It's perplexing to discover the events going on in the deep South as I was growing up in a fairly integrated Northern community, oblivious to the cruelty of that time. Ms. Nicholas does a credible job of depicting events of those times, perhaps giving hope for better racial understanding."
2,Language.,I had to quit reading fairly early on because I don't like that kind of language. I realize there is worse but I don't care for it.
3,Freshwater road,"I know that the story is probably very acurate to the time. However, it was very slow reading and seemed repetitive and boring."
1,Put down book,"This is the first book in a long time that I've put down and stopped reading. It is overly descriptive and wordy. The story drags on. I kept thinking to myself come on get going, what's the story here? Really dragged along. Can't figure how it rec'd so many 5 star reviews in the 1st month except that they must have been written by friends. Can't recommend it."
2,Freshwater Road,"I wasn't too crazy about this book. I am from Mississippi myself. I feel it was very factional correct. I am 63 years old so I remember the times well that this book was written about. With that said, it still was a little to slow for me. The author seemed to repeat herself a lot.The main character seemed as if she was always holding back. It maybe a race thing. A black reader may get more out of the book. I love reading any thing southern but this just wasn't me."
5,A fresh and different coming-of-age novel,"I read this novel because of its setting and subject since I was a young white woman from California who did something similiar in Alabama in the early 60's. By choosing this setting to have her protagonist find herself gives us a thrilling true-to-life look at a period in our history that, unfortunately, still exists in so many minds and places. Nicholas' descriptions put us smack in the summer of the South and her conversations are true to the area, the time, and the age of the speaker. By adding the voice of her father in Detroit we have a complete picutre and separate views of the protagonist. I recommend it highly and I think it should be taught in high school histrory classes.Jacqueline Hand"
4,Cant get enough,"I'm not even done with the book and I can't seem to put it down. Great so far, I love it."
5,Great Debut For A New Writter,"A beautifully written narrative. The author takes the reader back to the initial years of the Civil Rights movement, to the dedicated work, the dangers and the accomplishments, in an experienced and engaging way. After all the talk in our recent election about this country going to hell, this book reminded me of all the progress we have made as a country and how grateful we should be to all the people who helped get us to where we are. Now we just have to keep going forward."
4,Freshwater Road,Great read about the hardships concerning voting in the old Mississippi days. Itgives us a look at how certain people had to fight for the basic right of voting.
3,"Good, but not as good as the original","Years ago I had a set of these lights that had the older, higher brightness (and energy use I am sure) bulbs. They looked better than these new ones. Also the new ones have an annoying habit of the color shells falling off - they are all up with scotch tape to hold them on, but this fix looks ugly upon close inspection.I wish I had the old ones, but given that they are no longer available, I just hope the manufacuter fixes the bulb shell issue to make them a good product. I recommend them to all who like the lights, but beware of the design faults."
3,summoner guide,"I bought this book as I was getting 'bogged down' with some of the side quests.I found the Prima Guide helpful with these and it contains some useful information about weapons, armour, etc and has fairly useful maps.Having said that, the text is not always clear and is at times downright difficult to read and the book itself is a little flimsy. I also feel that the publishers could have put a lot more detail in than they did.All in all quite a useful book if you are stuck but certainly not the best of it's type and not the best value for money."
2,A great guide if you want a second copy of the manual.,"I was dissapointed in the guide in that it contained next to none of the secret things about the game. It contained no statistics on summoned creatures, spells, items (as far as amount of points healed, etc.), and many other things, all of which would have been most helpful. I must give credit in that the guide does tell you where to go, I'll give it that. But in order to fully experience the game, however, a far more in depth and detailed guide would be needed. All-in-all the guide leaves a lot to be desired. I think a great game like summoner should have a great guide to go with it."
2,Not worth all the reasonable price,"I just received the vacuum and used it on my kitchen floor. I was shocked to see it didn't pick up the crumbs as good as I thought. My 15-year old Hoover vacuum did a better job. It just kept pushing the crumbs and not picking them up. I kept adjusting the height of the vacuum using the dial on the bottom which is extremely hard to do. It took a lot of muscle to turn it. Adjusting all the height differences made no change in its ability to pick up the crumbs. It is also a very heavy vacuum and the placement of the cord is not well designed. I kept having to move the cord so I wouldn't run over it , because it comes out from the bottom of the vacuum. On a positive note, I loved the lift off and turbo brush to vacuum the stairs. I thought that part did a great job, but overall I did not like it and returned it."
1,It's not working,"I bought it in local store in 2006. I have ever used it only less than 5 times so far because it doesn't pick up anything. The brush stirs up hairs and leave them on carpet. In fact, when I am trying to clean inside, it's surprised me there is nothing there. It simply doesn't work. It's light and quiet. Otherwise, I will rate it 0."
5,Douglas Kennedy books.,"I love Douglas Kennedy books. I think I have read all of them - am currently in the middle of Gods Country which is differeent, but still entertaining. I wish he would hurry up and write more !!"
4,Douglas Kennedy,Another great ready by Douglas Kennedy - i am now actively searching for all his books - they are just great!!
3,"good, but not his best.","Engaging story. Douglas Kennedy does a great job at weaving an interesting plot with varied characters, but his negative stereotyping of evangelical Christians got a bit old. Kennedy's radical leftists seemed human, with good and bad traits, but the Christians were all depicted as a bunch of losers, with no redeeming qualities. Life's not like that; there's always good and bad in people."
3,Would rank game 3rd after Heroes 3 and 6,"Actually liked very much this game despite general critics that not as good as Heroes 3.Most concepts are similar, with a few improvements and differences.Graphics are way more subtle,. The fact you could use your heroes without armies brought an entire new dimension.Would rate 3rd in the series affer heroes 3 and 6 that are likely ex aequo."
2,no just no,"Heroes 3 was awesome and i found little to no problems with it, but this game at least for me crashes constantly or somehow ends up with glitched audio loops speaking of audio i find the game sounds very annoying in comparison to other games. i like these types of game to have decent graphics but i can live without the crazy 3d stuff if it is going to cause my game to crash at least once every scenario/campaign match i play."
2,What a disappointment,"What a disappointment. So far most of the rest of the Heroes of Might and Magic series has been great. However, this particular one brings nothing really interesting or new to the series. From what I've seen so far the big deal that has been made about it seems to be that you can now use your heroes in combat and strategy. New creatures, new maps, etc. not much else.The AI is horrible, the computer cheats constantly, gathering massive armies in short spans of time that are either impossible or difficult to counter. The cd doesn't ship with a finished multiplayer mode, and 3DO has promised a patch to make this available, but I am unsure if it ever came out. The soundtrack is pretty typical for this series, nothing impressive. All in all, if you want to play a good Heroes of Might & Magic game go back to 2 or 3, after all there's not a huge difference in the games."
4,Give Them A Break,"You have to forgive 3do. They just can't compete with a game like WarCraft3, or Unreal Tournament 2003. At the same time, though, they never claimed to.HOMM 4 is the BEST turn based RPG/Strategy out there. I've played every HOMM in the series, and each installment continues to bring the series to new heights. HOMM always has been a kind of underdog, never selling that many copies, but lots of people play it over and over again.Some improvements they've made are a 3D environment, a complete engine overhaul, completely new graphics, a new magic system, etc. They've added quite a bit for only one step in the series.So, should you buy this game, you ask? It depends, if you like a slower paced, tension built, time stealing kind of game, which requires a lot of thought, and intelligence, then you may have what it takes. Like I said, it's not a RTS, or a FPP Shooter either, so don't expect it to be."
2,"Poor job by 3do. This is not Heroes, but a all new game.","I was upset and disapointed with this game. The change was far more then needed, or wanted. I wanted more of the same and yet 3do made a completely different game here. I have been playing Heroes for years and would not have paid the price for this game If I had known it was going to be so different. Sorry 3do but to me you screwed up big time with this one."
2,Not as fun as I thought it would be,This game really dissapointed me. The grahics were really great and all but the game play and control really [was not good]. This game is really hard to play. HOMM3 was simple and way better then this.My advice do not buy this game. This game [is so bad] that I am willing to sell this game ...
1,HOMM IV falls way short,"First of this is not the US game. THey are selling a knock off UK version. Secondly it does not have Multi Player support, not even hot seat, even though it says it does. You can upgrade it py patching all the way to v3.0 and get multi but most places with the patch are pay sites since 3DO is no longer in business."
5,The best game ever...,The game gave me hours of fun! I recomend to any man who consider himself a real gamer!
3,What no multiplayer!?!?,Ok I have been waiting for this game for a long time and I am at a loss as to why there is no multiplayer included with the game. Every other Heroes had why not this one? Everything about this game seems great except for that. What the [heck].
5,A fun game,"I never played the first 3 Heroes games, so I can't really draw a comparison. But I really enjoyed Heroes IV and am looking forward to getting the expansion."
4,New graphics = More Gameplay,I played HOMM 2 and 3. This one looks like it builds upon those with the addition of new and snazzy graphics. Not that this is a bad thing. I will fully support a game that I have enjoyed previously if they have upgraded the graphics while keeping the gameplay the same. I would go and buy this game ...
1,Where is multiplayer support!,MULTIPLAYER IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE 3 Months after the release. They even included a nice note saying multiplayer would be available shortly in a patch. It has been 3 months.. 3D0 has lost this long time HOMM fan.Where can I return this piece of patchware.
2,Not worth your time,"This isn't worth your time. The First Heroes games were excellent. I spent about 2 month playing H3. But the fourth game is disappointing, it has several innovations, that make the game worse. The Heroes 3 game is older, but much better."
2,Don't bother.,"This game is ok. While they have added some pretty neat new features (mentioned above), they seem to have taken out everything that was so terrific about hmm3. I liked being able to upgrade my creatures and the random map generator was the greatest thing going. Gameplay is so much slower in 4, although the campaign scenarios have better stories and a little more action and mystery to them, ie you have to complete one task in a scenario before you can move on to the next as opposed to just find the grail kind of thing. Overall, I don't think I'd really recommend this game, stick with heroes 3."
1,This game...SAY NO,"Well, I bought this game about the day it was released. My brother moved away, and we used to have a lot of fun playing head-to-head Heroes III over the net. As you can imagine, we were pretty stoked when Heroes IV was released, because we were getting so good at III, it was becoming boring. When I looked at the box, it never occurred to me to check to see if it said ""multi-player."" I mean, after all, it was *Heroes*. I installed, it, and clicked ""Multiplayer."" Oh, gee! ""We're sorry, this feature is not yet implemented, please check our website for updates."" I was incensed! I do still check the site occasionally. They released an expansion. Before they even finished the core game! As far as I know, there *still* isn't a multiplayer update, over a year later, meaning there won't ever be..."
5,"Different, but that's not always bad.","Heroes of Might and Magic 3 was one of my favorite games of all time. This game is not as good but it still is far above most games.New things-Heroes can fight and customizing them is much more fun.You choose between high lv units. adds lots of strategyMap editor is huge and in depthOld things that are goneNo upgradesThe 2dish system, now its isometricI don't think that this game has ruined the series in the least. It could use a few more units but other then that it is nearly perfect. The campaigns are good and keep you going (one of em is really sad) and the units are more creative A+"
3,bjr934,This game is not as good as the first three. They took away alot of the use of magic and your heroes no longer have any special skills any can't learn as many spells unless you are very high in level and by that time you should have already won.The game so just buying creatures and fighting with them and the aritafacts are so so And so far a have not found a cursed one.The game has change (ITS NOT THE SAME) some things are good about it but the first three games they made were better.
3,The War & Peace of Games. BEWARE!,"I am by no means a gaming expert, but I have had a mild addiction to Heroes 3 for a couple of years now. I was borderline ""giddy"" while driving home from the local came store with my new prize - Heroes 4.6 weeks later, and I finally gave the thing away. It's not a bad or even mediocre game by far, but the problem for me is that I have a job. Meaning to say that any normal human with half a schedule cannot devote the time needed in order to get their hands around this goliath. It is so complicated and intensive and well, frankly too thorough. I'll stick to my old version. WHO NEEDS THE HEADACHE.Bottom line - If you have your PhD in Gaming - this one's for you. If you're just a regular gal who likes to play a good, robust game a few times a week - get Heroes 3 - you'll love it."
5,Having actually played the game....,"I bought the game this weekend and while I have only put in about 2 hours of playing time I am EXTREMELY impressed and can't wait for the hours to whither away at work so I can go home and play some more.If you've played Heroes II or Heroes III get ready for a VERY different game. Although they have lessened the number of monsters available in the game they have significantly raised the quality of the monster in the game. Almost all of the monster's have special abilities or some unique trait, even the lowly peseants.The playing controls all still seem to be there from the older games however they are moved around the screen some to give more screen to informational things and maps.Overall it's a VERY cool game and I'm glad I paid the price to play it now instead of waiting 6 months for the price to drop like I usually do."
2,Abomination,"For years I've preferred games distributed by 3DO, largelybecause they were so well programmed. HOMM4 is very poorlyprogrammed. It runs slow right off the bat, and quickly andsteadily slows down until it locks up the system, requiringa cold reboot. It's a serious memory leak. I've run intonumerous other bugs as well, such as the weapons shopssuddenly ceasing to work, inventory items vanishing, etc.The AI is also poor, making the game much too easy to win,even at high difficulty levels. This is a sad end to what hadbeen arguably the greatest game series."
2,This game would be AWESOME if the A.I. was a lot tougher!,"I really love everything they did to Heros 4 except for the fact that the A.I. stinks. When I play Heros 3, I lose at least 50 percent of the time. However, when I play Heros 4, there is almost no possiblity to lose to the A.I. For that reason, this game is REALLY BORING. I was very disapointed. If they patched the A.I. it would really give new life to this game. But, this game might be a very fun multiplayer game. It's too bad they game makers are taking so long to make it a multiplayer game."
1,This game freaking ...,"I have been a HOMM fan ever since HOMM 2, I loved HOMM 2,and loved HOMM 3 even more. Man, HOMM 3 is such a great game.I looked forward to this game, but no, 3DO had to change thegame completely. 3DO manages to successfully taken outeverything that was fun in the HOMM series and give us ahoribble looking and boring game.no longer we have the beautiful graphics of HOMM 3,no longer we have the challenge of HOMM 2no longer we have the serious tactics of HOMM series.good job 3DO, no wonder you are doing so bad.get rid of the M&M; series and focus on HOMM!!but I heard they are not going to develope the HOMMseries any more. which is just stupid. how muchdid you make off M&M;? how much did you make off HOMM?can you guys do math?"
2,Why?,"A perfect example of the folly of fixing that which isn't broken. 3DO has managed to make one of my favorite games a major let down. If you liked Heroes 2 & 3 (true improvements over #1), this is likely to disappoint you. Annimations are poor, important arrtibutes are hidden in screens way too cluttered in ""decoration,"" and the new magic system is just plain poor. This (I'd guess) ill conceived attempt to move to a more AD&D like format is breaking the strength of previous versions - simplicity and non-conformity. You'll be better off spending your money on something else."
1,Knock off,The amazon company sends you the wrong product. They send you a cheap Ubisoft product when it is suppose to be 3DO. So you cannot get expansions for the ubisoft software for this game. Amazon needs to send the correct 3DO version of this game as shown and told to be.
3,This game is one that u should not look forward 2,I am a huge fan over heroes 3 but this game has its pros and cons. For example There IS NO RANDOM MAP GENERATOR!!!!!!If they made a platinum edition for this game like heroes 3 and also INCLUDED A RANDOM MAP GENERATOR! then i would run and buy it in a heartbeat. O AND ANYONE WHO HELPED MAKE THIS GAME MIGHT HAVE READ THIS REVIEW U SHOULD GET UP AND PUT ON WAT I PREFERED AND SO MANY OTHERS DID 2.
1,Not qualified,"For a person with only a master's degree, he has alot to say about nothing. His comments can be easily refutted by well known creation scientist, who have a doctorate degree."
2,"SEEING, BUT BLIND","I RESPECT THE CREDENTIALS OF THE AUTHOR, BUT I DO HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. WHY DO EVOLUTIONISTS, THE ""TRUE SCEINTISTS"",CONSTANTLY LOSE DEBATES AGAINST THEIR ""UNSCEINTIC""OPPONENTS? IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT WHEN ONE WORSHIPS A BLIND WATCH MAKER,HE WILL BE CONFORMED TO HIS IMAGE. WHEN READING THIS BOOK BE AWARE OF THE AUTHOR'S EXTEREME PREJUSTICE AGAINST ANY OTHER EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS BUT HIS AND THE ""OPEN-MINDED"" ESTABLISHMENT. I RECOMMEND MICHAEL CREMO'S BOOK ""FORBIDDEN ARCHEOLOGY'S IMACT"" OR JONATHAN WELLS', ICONS OF EVOLUTION"",AS A GOOD COUNTER READ. IT SHOWS YOU HOW THESE ""TRUE SCEINTISTS"" REACT WHEN THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING."
3,Interesting but a little too contrived,"This book is a good read but a little too consciously profound and the Angel Cohen a little too Reminiscent of John Travolta in the movie ""Michael,"" That said, it still lends some interesting insights into the conflict into the Miccle East, expecially the Palestinian side of the story."
5,Cool & Groovy,"This guy can play! Honestly speaking, I haven't been too keen on solo guitar music up until now...but this best-of CD by Masa Sumide has turned my thinking around and given me insight into ""one-man band"" music. The last track ""One Heart"", in particular, is so beautiful it will bring tears to your eyes. It did when I first listened to it. This album is a winner and will stay on my play-list forever."
1,The star is for the DVD transfer/ Bhowani Junction a great film,"Why is there being marketed this series of very good films (some not) at these sky rocket prices, with no significant art work, no inserts, no trailers, no special features, and no chapters with any logic..every ten minutes there is a chapter break, and are they awful.These are DVDS from tapes, sold to customers for close to $30.00 each.Further, the restrictions on playing them are absurd, showing the nature of the copying. They are way over-priced knock offs, of the very bad over seas variety.Hard to understand, but beware, and if you have B. Junction, Private Lives, Sins of Rachel Cade etc., on VHS, hold on to those copies, they are much better.At this price..a disgrace."
5,English Christmas,"This is an excellent new project from the gifted vocalist.Michael adds his own self described style ""english in it"".This project combines his powerful voice singing the majorityof the songs in an R&B/ jazz style.The remake of Mary Did You Know is incredible and is actually better the his original release of the song in the 90's.Other tunes are fan favorites in Silent Night, Go Tell It On The Mountain, O Holy Night, etc.English fans will be very pleased with this latest effort from English."
4,Great way to make a comeback!,"Michael English has come a long way in the past few years. To come out with a Christmas album that celebrates the birth of the Savior is an awesome way to cap off his return to the Christian Music scene.As all of his work, this will surely inspire and encourage you when you listen."
3,A study of sequestration,"Onetime Simpson juror Tracy Kennedy has written an account that, intentionally or otherwise, argues strongly against jury sequestration. Those looking for juicy tidbits about courtroom proceedings during the first Simpson trial won't find them here, and in a way that's the point. Kennedy demonstrates the effects of long-term sequestration, showing that the jurors were not only not informed about most of what was happening in court (those who watched CNN knew more than the jury), but that they also grew increasingly, dangerously isolated from the outside world. Tracy and his wife Judith contribute chapters as Judith recounts her growing concern over Tracy's emotional and physical health. ""Mistrial of the Century"" could be useful reading for those studying the jury process."
2,Injustice to title,"I am glad that I bought this book at a thrift store. I was disappointed in the content. The title should have been more closely associated to the content. I believe that the author was merely trying to ride on the sensationalism of the trial, contrary to his written statements within the book. Although I can sympatize with the author's anguish, while associated with the trial, a different title should have been chosen. As an adjunct professor,of Criminal Justice, I may make a passing comment in class about the content of the book. However, I certainly would not recommend it to my students."
3,A cute book for the younger set&#65533;,"Okay, so it?s pretty predictable. And the storyline is repetitive quite a bit. However, this is just something about the story of Prince Edward and Princess Elizabeth who take a journey to visit the Engraver to break a marriage contract that makes you want to read on. It might be the adorable drawings. It might be wondering what strange place they stumble across next. Whatever it is, it?s a cute, quick read that had morals at the very center."
1,Doesnt work,I have dark hair and it doesnt make it any lighter it just dyed my skin lighter and looked awkward I wont purchase again It also stings when you put it on as if it's burning your skin
4,Got have it,"This product is great! It does the job in only 8 minutes, bleaches nicely and evenly. I have been using this product for over 13 years and it is great. I recommend it to anyone"
5,This product is really great. I have sensitive ...,This product is really great. I have sensitive skin but I didn't have any problems with this product. It lightens facial hair quickly and effectively.
1,For Thin Hair Only,"This product, or any bleaching product, is only good for the thin wispy hairs. If you have dark thick coarse hair it won't work. I tried Jolen bleach as well as the Sally Hansen bleach on some dark thick coarse hairs on my upper lip & chin area & after wiping away the cream they weren't bleached at all, if I left it on any longer it would have burned my skin. If you have the thin wispy hairs it WILL work however so not all hope is lost on this product, I tried it on some thin wispy hairs on some parts of my body & it did bleach the hair. I am unfortunate to inherit the dark thick body hair & face hair from my Italian family & I wish I could say it worked on the thick hairs on my face but it does not. Thin hairs on the body yes it does work."
4,great product,This product works well for people who have dark facial hair. It is a gentle way of bleaching those hair sticking out from your upper lip area. Even works well for bleaching dark arm hair. Though using excessively or/and frequently can damage the skin.
3,"Overall, I liked this product. It bleached pretty ...","Overall, I liked this product. It bleached pretty well on the first try. You have to mix the creme with the supplied powder prior to using it. After applying the creme mixture, you have to wait ten minutes, so it's not something you can do very quickly. I'd recommend using this product."
1,ITCHY AND IRRITATED SKIN,"So I got my bleaching creme in the mail today and I went to test it out. By the way, I have fair skin and dark brown hair. As a precaution, I only tested a small part of my inner arm. After applying the creme, my arm felt fine. 2 minutes later, however, my arm began itching. As the minutes went by, the itch progressively became worse. After 10 minutes, I quickly washed off the creme. I looked at my inner arm and saw patches of red, irritated skin. I have slightly sensitive skin, but I should not have broken out into a rash. After all, this is only a bleaching kit.If your skin is even the slightest sensitive, I DO NOT recommend using this product."
3,This product worked fairly well on the dark ...,"This product worked fairly well on the dark hair on my arms. I also tried it on my eyebrows and on the hairs that I sometimes get on my upper lip. It worked pretty well, but left my eyebrows a little orange-colored and it irritated the skin on my face a little. I'd recommend this product to anyone who'd like to lighten the hair on their face and arms."
1,you call this large?,"I got this hat as a gift. I don't know how they figure sizes, but this M/L couldn't fit the smallest adult head. Maybe they're sized for children, but I didn't see that in the description. Very disappointed."
4,"nice purchase, fast shipping...","this is a nice product, was delivered correctly and on time, exactly the way it appears on the image."
1,Misleading product info,"I purchased this item from Amazon because the kit included 4 AA rechargable batteries. Upon receiveing the item I discovered the kit actually had 2 AA and 2 AAA rechargable batteries. I need 4 AA not two. There are two different products listed for this kit, one being the aforementioned and the one I wanted.Energizer Easy Charger KitFor this reason, I give both Amazon and eek Technology 1 star."
5,OILCANCHARLEY,"CAN NO LONGER FIND PRODUCT LOCALLY, FOUND ON LINE, REASONABLE PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT. WILL BUY AGAIN."
3,#2 FINISHED....,"Okay, I've read #1>Dead Wrong, and finished #2>Dead Certain. Story still reads a little slower than my usual mystery/suspense novels (that's why only 3 stars), but the story *is* rather unique and it kept my attention.A tip: When I have lots of different characters in a book, I use a large index card as a bookmark and jot down pg#, character's name, and something about them on it. >Hey, it's hard remembering who everybody is! And throughout these three books in the series, there are LOTS of folks!I've just finished #3>Dead Even, if you're interested in my last review on this series.....?"
2,Predictable police procedural...,"Did I read the same book as the other readers here?This is a very predicatable police procedural with a same-old, same-old plot.The characters are not sympathetic and full of both racial and ethnic stereotypes.The heroine particularly is short of a full deck. This book is more D.O.A. than Dead Certain.Sara Paretsky, Ruth Rendell, and other women who write GOOD cop/mystery books shouldn't fear this second rate effort. Pass."
2,Fell flat,"Was really looking forward to this 2nd installment in the series, but was disappointed for the most part. Check it out at the local library instead of buying, is my advice."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR - BUYER BEWARE! SHOP AROUND!,"I just bought the genuine replacement battery from [...] for $14.95. This site is overcharging customers. Please shop around for the best value, but Plantronics warns on their equipment to use only genuine Plantronics replacement parts. That is why, after shopping around looking at all these cheaper-priced places and realizing that they were not genuine Plantronics batteries, I went to the Plantronics website to purchase the real thing. Imagine my surprise when I found it to be less expensive than this place has it for!"
2,never recived,I never recived the item so i don't know how the video would've been. The seller told me that they lost it.
5,The Best!!!,"A wonderful book. Great designs and photos. Amazingly creative patterns and yarns, and a brief visit to Ireland to top it off."
5,China Jewels Nativity Porcelain Sheep,The sheep are a lovely addition to the Nativity Set. Nice detail on the figure.
4,"Exciting, well paced adventure shot entirely in Africa.","Actor/director Cornel Wilde has fashioned a tight, well crafted adventure story of survival in the African bush with ""The Naked Prey"". The story involves the capture of a party of white trophy hunters by a tribe of native Africans, who are gruesomely tortured to death one-by-one. Cornel Wilde, whose clothes had been removed by the natives in preparation of his execution, succeeds in escaping (hence the title of the movie). The rest of the film involves his fight for survival in the wilderness while being pursued by a group of native warriors.The film starts out slowly but the tension builds as the white hunters ignore and insult the natives that they see as harmless. The scenes of torture and death are quite graphic for a mid-60's film and because of this the film is not for family viewing. The movie really takes off once Cornel Wilde escapes and his fight for survival is as realistic as it is gruesome."
4,Raw film before there was a category,"When film making was still learning to shoot on location, this film takes us to colonial Africa, where tribal life was still the way of life for nature and humans. Cornel Wilde makes us look at survival in the raw."
5,Naked Prey,Quality of movie (Criterion) is great. Movie is timeless in its plot. Man vs. Man. Cornel Wilde is great as he did all his own stunts and the other actors were tribal bushmen. A true classic in my opinion but others may say different for different reasons.
5,The ultimate adventure action movie,"There is not much of a story, after all it is all about the chase. The lone survivor, and the hunters becoming the hunted. What really distinguishes this movie, is that it achieves all the drama relying only on visuals and cinematography. There is almost no dialogue, the silence of the African Savannah is only interrupted by a few grunts and shouts. However, the action with all its twists and plots is unrelenting until the end of the movie. This movie is a landmark because it relies just on the basic elements, there are no special effects, gratuitous violence or moronic dialogue. There is only one atypical scene in the beginning, about the cannibal cooking practices that could have been left out. I have the VHS version."
4,Gripping,"There was more to Cornel Wilde the director than there ever was to Cornel Wilde the glamorous matinee idol. His risky independent effort THE NAKED PREY is one of the greatest of all chase movies, and all the better for managing, with minimal dialogue, to impart a cultural awareness and a socio-political viewpoint as well. Stunning to look at, taut, tense, and eye-opening."
3,Miopic reviews,"It astounds me how some people are not able to or are unwilling to take things within their own context. It is obvious to any person with a half a wit that something that is decades old must be judged by the way things were done at the time, regardless if it is considered right or wrong be current standards. It is after all historic by now, and we can learn by these anachronisms but still appreciate them for what they are ie basic entertainment. All this self righteous pseudo intellectual bull*#+"" makes me ill!!"
3,"Movie five, price a one.","Criterion is known for two things; a better than average job on the DVD release, and sky-high prices. I hate to see Criterion get the rights to a movie since it means I won't be buying that movie for a long time, if ever."
5,where is the justice,"This movie is a great masterpiece, easily stands among the great survival movies of the 60's my only complaint is to Mel Gibson..........why don't you give the credit for ""Apocalypto"" to Cornel Wilde who you stole every idea from"
4,Realistic and exciting story of survival and courage!,"I first saw this film in the theatre as a teenager. It really packed a wallop then and is still very compelling. The action is well choreographed and the photography is beautiful. All of the characters are complex human beings with reasons for behaving as they do and the film is refreshingly void of stereotypes and cliches. The suspense builds until the last few seconds of the film and Wilde's fate remains uncertain right up until that point. The brief ""salute"" given Wilde by the Native leader at the film's end was very moving. A great film! WHY is not available on DVD??????"
4,"Intense, well-filmed movie portraying a run for survival","This intense movie portrays a man running for his life from african warriors. The chase scenes are dramatic, tense, and realistic. After the initial scenes of torture which are somewhat fantastical and stereotypical, the african warriors are portrayed as strong, fierce, brave, and single-minded in their pursuit of their prey. It becomes a battle of wits and endurance between the hunters and the hunted. This is not a flashy and shallow modern movie, it is a dramatic portrayal of man against man, in a struggle for survival."
5,An Excellent DVD Prospect!,"... I found it an impressive tale of survival in the great African wilderness. A genuinely savage story of the survival of the fittest, whom in this white movie happens to be the white man's superior knowledge of the wilderness... To be shelved next to ""Walkabout"" and ""The Emerald Forest"" in the ""White Man Trapped In The Jungle"" section! Somebody please produce this on DVD soon!!! I want it in my budding collection!"
5,"The Original ""Apocalypto""","A bloody footrace to the death between one unarmed man and a pack of sadistic hunters... sound familiar?After I saw Apocalypto, the next day I had to pull out my VHS tape of ""naked Prey"" and watch it again. IMO this movie is considerably more intense, more satisfying than Mel Gibson's razzle-dazzle imitation... but I'm an old guy... YMMV..."
5,WONDERFUL MOVIE,"THIS WONDERFUL MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END IS SUBERB, STORY OF MANS SURVIVAL. I HAVE IT ON VHS, BUT IT MUST BE SEEN ON THE WIDESCREEN FORMAT.BUY IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONTED."
1,Tired exotica,"Let's be real. What gives this movie its ""charm"" is the fact that it plays on and reinforces every Western bias about the dangerous ""otherness"" of African culture. If you must, watch it for its cinematography and haunting score, but don't kid yourself about why it is so ""thrilling."""
1,Mobile Edge MEALC1 - Lock does not fit new HP TouchSmart tx2z,I purchased this item based on the description that it will fit ANY laptop. Well that is not true...! This lock does not fit my HP TouchSmart tx2z. I was mislead by this description of this item. I will suggest the vendor to report which laptop brands this security lock would work.
4,Charming plot! Easy Read.,"Meghan's Mom's dying wish is to see her daughter married so she'll be cared for when her mother is gone. She has regaled her mother with stories about her secret crush, only her mother believes they are dating. When, Meghan explains her mother's dream for her to the hospital doctor, she is overheard -and misunderstood - by a nurse who shares Meghan's happy news with the dying matriarch. At least she will die happy, Meghan admits. But her mother found the will to live, recovered, and is now coming to visit Meghan and her new husband. Meghan is prepared to concoct a story about an extended business trip until Mr. Right shows up in the wrong place at the wrong time!The clever plot and charming characters had me rooting for them to get together - reminds me a bit of the film ""While You Were Sleeping"". The writing was a bit choppy at first but gained polish as the story progressed."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"i WAS ESPECTING MORE OF THE BOOK, nOT A SENTENCE ABOUT THE LORD EVERY THREE MINUTES. i DONT REALLY LIKE RELIGIOUS BOOKS. gOOD STORY LINE BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER, TAKING THE LORD OUT OF EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE."
5,Cute Little Book,"This cute little book tells the story of Mary Kate and Ashley. It is a small book, so it doesn't give boring details - only interesting facts. It is interesting and entertaining. The book tells how these girls (twins) got started in show biz and some interesting things in their lives. If you are interested in little autobiographies, then you would like this book.These girls are grown now. But they still have fashions for a much younger age group. My youngest daughter likes their fashions."
2,A scan read,"overly distracting language, which constantly repeats itself in several chapters. There are good points within the book it just takes a while to reach them!"
4,Technically great,"If you have any interest in what happens to make a U2 concert happen, by the crew members, designers, and band, this is the book for you. It is not only a backstage pass to most of U2's greatest tours, it is also a technical approach to a technical process. Pictures are pretty good too, but don;t purchase this book if you want some old photos from long-gone tours; buy this book if you want to read about the tours.This would be a good book for someone interested in becoming a ""roadie"" or stage crew member, and all the like, for it talks a lot about how and why the tours were as they were. It will require a lot of reading, so don't thing it is a simple page turner.If you love U2, want to know more about their tours, from the inside out, this book is for you. Get ready to read!"
3,The New Minuchin,"This book is the culmination of several years of Minuchin testing his 4 Step model. Once he told me he was writing his autobiography with emphasis on his development as a therapist. Apparently he went in another direction. The first chapter described where Minuchin is now.To those of us working with the urban poor families in the neglected communities this book is not for us. This publication represents an accomodation to the new fads in psychotherapy.Nevetheless the chapters written by Minuchin are not that bad. Personally I prefer the Minuchin of the 60's, 70's and 80's."
4,A must-read guide for structural family therapy,"This is a thorough guide to understand structural family therapy on counselling on family case yet a bit expensive in price. If you want to know more the power of counselling, you need to read the book."
2,Boring,"I did not get the insight into Prince I was looking for at all. I found the book boring. The articles/interviews with him in Rolling Stone gave a lot more insight and were free. Does anyone know of any book about him that really gives one insight into his personality, mind and life stories??"
1,No Joy - space truck driver game,"Save your money and time. 3DO doesn't have the technical resources to do multi player gaming. The game constantly disconnects. When it doesn't disconnect the online screen is jumpy. The game itself has a weak attempt at an game economy; where players are space truck drivers on hauling missions. Long, boring, endless hauling missions. There is a chat window. Player's exchange low brow humor, or mindless dribble. All this for a mere $10/mth subscription fee."
5,Fantastic Study Aid,"I used the GMAT test and can't speak for the others. For GMAT, the material was extremely comprehensive with lots of sample questions and tests as well as lots of excellent tutorials to review math, testtaking tips etc. I also picked up a few other books, including the Kaplan book on GMAT, and this software is heads and shoulders above anything else.I would highly recommend getting this software if you intend to study for GMAT.Scott."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON MacBooks!!!!!,"Here's the message from EncoreUSA, the software publisher:""Limited Macintosh Intel Core Duo supportUnless specifically listed in your product's System Requirements, Macintosh systems running on Intel technology are not supported.""In other words, it won't install on a MacBook.Besides that it has an uber cheesy interface and is designed for the old GRE test (which had an analytic problem solving section and different timing on the quantitative).Even if you don't have a new Mac, it isn't worth buying.It really shouldn't even be sold anymore."
2,"Looks good, relatively comfortable, but flimsy","The first thing I noticed about this helmet was its cheap construction. The plastic shell feels flimsy and plastic trim pieces feel like they could very easily be ripped off. The construction is not solid enough to inspire much confidence in safety. Even for just $80, I feel like I've been ripped off."
1,only lasted for 10 rides,Got two of these at the end of the season (Sept). So I did not use them until this spring so the warranty is no good. Always had a problem with the release button to pick up the chin bar on both of them. After just a few rides one of the buttons broke and will not work at all. I would stay away from Fuel helmets.
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered the XLg version of this helmut but I noticed right off that it was too small. After I examined it closer I noticed that the padding in the helmut was sized XLg. I then removed the padding and saw a big L inside the helmut. What they did was to put a XLg padding inside a Large size helmut and then called the thing Xtra-Large. Apparently they had no XLg helmuts around so they sold me a Large helmut with an XLg padding! Better to stay far away from this as you probably won't get the size that you ordered.
1,Very uncomfortable,"Had this helmet for a week and its about 15 minutes from home to work one way each day. This is the most uncomfortable helmet I have ever had. The padding fabric has honey-cone shape at the center (from the forehead all the way to the back of your head) to help air circulation. But this honey-cone shape fabric cut into the skin of my forehead so much, it left a honey-cone imprint on my forehead for an hour (keep in mind, this is only 15 minutes ride). The imprint will last for up to 2 hours on my forehead. I don't understand why the other reviewer, Flo Troche, said its comfortable. My guess is he must be working for this company or something. And you might question maybe my size is not correct, and that is just not the case, it fit perfectly on my head. I had carefully measured my head size with the chart."
3,Anthony Hernandez,"Quick Shipping,Comfortable helmet,price is fairly modest,didnt like the button to pull up the helmet but other than that no complaints helmet does the job,looks quite big at first then when its on my head doesnt look bad,if i had to buy a helmet again i would buy this 1,attention grabber,patriotic."
1,More imported crap,"The overall construction is crap. big seams, misaligned rivets and such. very uncomfortable, part of lining digs in to my ear. it is gigantic. like shoulder width, no kidding. although it feels really tight for a large. its not too heavy but the weight is so spread out and high up over your head it makes you feel (and look) like a bobble head. and it is HOT. fogs up really bad too. the vents are apparently just for show, even at 65mph there is no difference when they are open or closed. pass on this one."
2,Not the Same,I was hoping this fragrance was the same as the one from the 90's. Unfortunately it isn't and the scent is not too flattering. I ended up giving the product away.
1,Kids found it boring,"If you're trying to instill an appreciation for classical music -- and I can't imagine any other reason to show Peter and the Wolf to kids -- don't buy this version. The DVD does have background music from the symphony, but the musical aspect is NOT EVEN MENTIONED. The true test is in its appeal: 3-year-old boy, 5-year-old boy, 9-year-old girl ... all found it boring."
2,Swiss schmaltz?,"Yuck. The story in which the animation is embedded is schmaltzy, and the acting is clunky. And-- this very Russian tale is set in *Switzerland*?!If you know Peter and the Wolf, you know it teaches you that the cat is an oboe, the duck a clarinet, etc. Not here. Wiped clean of such old-fashioned detail.Dumbed down. Not worthy. The Emmy award? They must have thought endorsing Prokofiev would make them look sophisticated.Stick with an audio-recording."
1,Avoid this one altogether!!!,"Between the amended ""politically correct"" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong!"
1,Horrible Movie,"How can you take something so beautiful such as Sergei Prokofiev's music and make it unbearable? Watch this movie and find out. You'll see a horrible story line with unsympathetic characters try and create a narrative for the music. The effect: disastrous. Kirstie Alley's whinning narrative supercedes the music in most points. The unimaginative child's remarks to his mother's, Kirstie Alley, narrative show that the writer's have no understanding of children or what to do with good music. The only thing worse than the story line was the awful animation. If you want a cheesy, poorly written and unimaginitive interpretation of some classical music you'll never hear during the movie than this is the movie for you; otherwise steer clear."
2,Not what I wanted,This was not Peter and the Wolf -- It used the music as a background to a silly story. I do not like Kirstie Alley
5,Peter and the Wolf DVD,"""Peter and the Wolf"" is a great way to present Prokofiev's music, and indeed classical music to children. My grandchildren love it, and watch it over and over again. I have bought 3 copies, one to have at home, and the other 2 for them to have at home. A big plus is the interactive Music Game which teaches children which instruments are playing each theme. This version of the classic is the most entertaining and educational I have seen."
4,Peter & the Wolf DVD,"I have used this version of Peter and the Wolf (originally on VHS) for years in teaching elementary music. My only frustration is that the dialogue obscures many of the musical themes. However, the feature at the end of the story - ""The Musical World of..."" makes up for this somewhat. I frequently show that section first.In addition, the DVD has a ""game"" on matching various animals with instruments which is extremely good for K thru 2nd.The production is ideal for a family and can be adapted well for classroom."
4,Cute animation of the work,"Very cute storyline for ""Peter and the Wolf."" It does start out a little slow and loses childrens' attention. Good overall."
4,Peter and the Wolf,"The grandkids loved it. Ages 7 and 5. They asked to watch itseveral times. I was disappointed in that it didn't showcase theorchestra instruments to educate them a little in that area, butthey didn't notice of course."
5,A Must Read for All GoLive Users,"I have been using GoLive since the Cyberstudio days, and this book STILL florred me on how much useful information it contained. Everything from the ""Well duh! I can't believe I didn't know that"" to the ""WOW"" tips are in here.Simple. Consolidated. Useful."
5,From the prospective of a 50+ white female ...,"Dr. Pierce details in an interesting and thought provoking way the struggles of the African-American population to gain an equal voice within the community of Indianapolis.From the prospective of a 60's generation who grew up in Gary, Polite Protest was enlightening and disturbing. I was uncomfortable reading about how long African-Americans had to struggle for equality in education, housing and employment.Without these significant changes in our society, it would be impossible for me to share a cup of coffee with the author, attend one of his classes, or live in the same neighborhood.Thank you Dr. Pierce for writing and enlightening, explaining and exploring. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to understand and learn."
1,Sub Woofer stopped working after 2 and 1/2 months,"today my wife noticed that the subwoofer wasn't working. I've turned it off, let it cool, restarted... nothing. It has plenty of space, I keep it fairly low so I don't anger the downstairs neighbors. I'm going to try out the warranty but I am not happy.They sent a new one. So far so good. I just had a defective model, seems to be becoming fairly common, (unrelated?) had my camera and monitor go bad after just a few days (from different companies). Or I'm just unlucky.And no I'm not misusing any of my items, and I am very comfortable with technology as well as patient with tech support.Only 2 out of 19 found my review helpful? Where's the love? Don't you want to know if a product goes bad and you have to pay to ship it so they can verify that yes it can't be repaired? Or was I just not descriptive enough when I said ""(it) wasn't working"". How about it didn't function at all and was replaced rather then repaired because Creative Labs agreed."
2,Don't buy them!!,"Speakers were great until, the subwoofer started to suddenly turn itself off every now and then. First we thought we'll live with it, since it would start working again ones you turn the main switch on the woofer off and turn it back on, and it would work fine. but the it got worst and the rate of it abruptly turning off increased to every couple of hours. and now it doesn't work at all. Turns out that a lot of people have faced the same problem, and creative has a terrible tech support. we are disappointed and will never buy any creative product again. we are going to sell it on ebay."
2,Sound is ok but .......,"Nice set of speakers and good features, but a big annoyance is there .... which is: the VERY VERY short speakers cables!! Yes, they are short to the extent that you should NEVER expect that you will take the toy out of the box and start enjoying! Instead, you should expect some effort to be done first to seek some electronic technician help to create a special extension for the supplied cables!!!Big shame!!"
1,Wait for the official dvd!,"Do not purchase this dvd. It's simply going to be a bunch of interviews about the band, but not actually featuring the band themselves.Evanescence will be releasing sometime this year a dvd featuring one of their live performances, as well as extras. Do yourself a favor and skip After Midnight."
3,Recommendation,"If you want something that's more precise, I suggest you get the ""Anywhere But Home"" dvd - exclusively made BY the band, not just something artificial. But if you're a fan, well, I suggest you get your hands on this, or any ""out-in-the-market"" Evanescence item."
2,Key problem,"I have an old Microsoft Natural Multimedia keyboard I'm very attached to. Sadly, my new computer does not have a PS2 port, so I bought this so I could still connect it.Big problem: It's slow. I set my keyboard delay to the smallest value possible, but it still doesn't work with this adapter. Press if you press and hold a key, it pauses, stutters, the goes. I'm going to have to replace this item as it does not let me scroll or navigate smoothly and quickly with my keyboard."
4,The only adapter that works on IOGear PS2 KVMs,"As many have pointed out, this is the only model that works well with IOgear's line of KVMs that are PS2-only models. I ordered several to have my 4 port KVM (the green one with the 4 cables built in). One of them turned out to be defective. The symptom was the computer reporting it as an unknown device. Amazon replaced it promptly at their expense, and all is well."
1,Does not work with my laptop docking station,"Was attempting to replace a Tripp-lite with this one because I thought it was giving me problems. This adapter would work on USB ports right on the laptop, but not on the docking station. The whole point is to connect this up to a KVM switch - so it must work on my docking station. The computer does recognize that ""some"" USB device has been attached, but can't figure out what it is. I called tech support and they had no ideas about how to remedy the problem. This is the only USB device to do this to me (works on built-in USB port, but not docking station port). Problems turned out to be the attached Keyboard and Mouse getting flaky - so the old adapter is back in place."
3,Tape Review,"Delivery and price were good, but it really doesn't work much better standard packing clear tape. I tried it on a car cover and was very disapointed, after a week, it was coming off"
4,Repair tape or packing tape?,"I bought this tape to repair a rip in an all-weather car cover. It applied easily but it hasn't been exposed to rain, so I don't know how ""water proof"" it is. I wanted to tape both sides of the cover but there was only enough tape to apply to one side. I had a role of shipping tape which I applied to the outside of the cover. From appearances the shipping tape looks the same as the repair tape, though I suppose the adhesive may be different, and I don't know the comparative cost. If you have shipping tape on hand, give it a try, first."
2,Only one good song.,"The title-track on this album is a great song, but the remainder of the selections are just mediocre. I don't doubt the musical talent of Atkins, but the songwriting doesn't keep pace with more major artists (A. Jackson, G. Strait, T. Keith, etc.) That's not a critisism, many country singers are great at recording, but not as gifted at songwriting...Randy Travis for example. In short, better song selection would go along way."
2,Pretty Bland,"I see a lot of potential in Rodney, but this album isn't very good. It is not his voice that is bad, it is his songs. If he had better songs to sing, he could be a huge success. Most all of the songs sound the same, and are very boring. If he gets the right producer, he will be very successful, but I didn't enjoy this album."
4,"GREAT CD, THOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHER TWO.","I bought this CD for the song, Honesty. Love that song, and well worth purchasing the CD for that song alone. I do like all the songs, but of the three CD's he's put out, this one is my least favorite, though it's still good.Make sure to get his other two, If You're Going Through Hell, and In America. Both are amazing CD's, every song is a #1, in my eyes."
4,Great New Artist,"Three of the songs on here I love, just had to have, and never get tired of; I'm very happy with the whole CD."
5,Splendid performance!,"I attended this live performance in the summer of 2000 - on three separate evenings. Each time the cast and orchestra were excellent - kudos to conductor Isaac Karabtchevsky who revealed more beauty in this score than I'd ever heard in other performances. I was surprised to find later it had been recorded. I managed to buy a copy and can report that it is also fine, excepting a few places where a singer's voice temporarily fades a bit due to movement across the stage.Disclaimer: my cousin sang Claggart, and I enjoyed a few dinners in Venice with some of the cast, but I was already a Britten fan and had heard his recording of Budd back in 1972 when I was still in high school."
2,A lot of nitpicks in this book are invalid,"For example he picks on one Trek ep for mentioning the Euygenics Wars of the 1990's and the fact that in the real life 1990's the Eugenics wars never took place. Also, he mentions inconsistencies beween the TOS and TNG shows. If these are nitpicks they should be in the TNG nitpickers guide. Also I hate when he talks about how Miri would be a shorter show if they (the landing party) could talk to the ship. Wrong author Phil! It would be a different show if they could talk to the ship."
4,Classic Fan Fun,"I don't recall how I came across the nitpicker's guides but I enjoy every one of them because they offer a deep look into episodes which causes you to notice things you didn't before, and this is coming from someone who considers himself quite observant. While all of the 'nits' mentioned may be just that, extremely nitpicky and easily rationalized, this book is in no way official and strictly for entertainment. I rated this book four stars only because TOS was a bit before my time and I haven't seen as much of this show as the others, so it wasn't as applicable to me. However, this book also includes reviews of the first six movies, which is the main reason I bought this. Unfortunately due to legal reasons there will be no updated Nitpicker's Guides, but the website started by author Phil Farrand (nitcentral) is still up and running if you're curious."
4,Can you see the real me?,Put away the crack pipe and come inside the Electric Circus. The animals are all insane. God help us. WASP RULES!
1,INSIDE ELECTRIC CIRCUS,"IF ONLY YOU PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SENT IT TO ME YOU KNOW THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH AMAZON IS YOU GOT BOGUS DEALERS THAT DO NOT SEND OUT THE ORDERS MADE I NOTICED A FEW OTHERS YOU WANT ME TO REVIEW BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE THEM YET , OR EVER. JOSEPH G MEDINA"
5,perfect,perfefct way to store millions of stuffed animals! we bought 2... put them in with anchors to prevent the weight and grabbby 5yr olds from pulling it out of the wall.
4,Extremely Satisfied,"I am extremely satisfied with this product. Easy to install, about 15 minutes total. It greatly improved the aesthetic and flow of my daughter's room."
5,Great product!,"This product is sturdy, received super fast and it holds all my daughters' stuffed animals with ease. Highly recommend this :)"
5,wonderful!!!!,This net is just what i was looking for. It holds all my daughters stuffed animals and was shipped very quick. Very happy and would def recommend this product!
4,"Toys, Toys, Everywhere","My daughter has entirely too many stuffed animals so when we went looking for an 'animal net' we turned to Amazon.This net was a perfect fit for us and we ended up getting another one for the other corner.One thing that would be good to know is how much weight can be supported, we have not had any issues whatsoever but I'm not sure what the net is rated for."
4,This toy hammock is just what we needed to get our children's stuffed animals out of the floor and up out of the way.,This toy hammock is just what we needed to get our children's stuffed animals out of the floor and up out of the way.
4,keeps things organized,this is so necessary! keeps clutter to a minimum. love how it looks in the room as well! perfect storage addition.
3,Not great with command strips,"This product would probably work perfectly with the given hooks that screw into the wall. However, since I'm renting my place, in an effort to put the fewest holes in the wall as possible, I simply attached command strip hooks to the areas where I wanted to hang this net. I picked a corner of the room, attached one hook to the back ceiling corner, and the other two on the wall a set distance away. It was an adventure that involves numerous instances of hooks unsticking and stuffed animals going everywhere, but eventually everything stayed where it was supposed to. Since I'm not using the given hooks, I can't blame any of my troubles on the product itself. I stuffed animals that added up to a surprising amount of weight and I'm actually really impressed with this product that it was able to fit all of them, including a rather large amusement park prize dolphin. Very happy with the size and expansion capacity of this product!"
2,Not a very good item!,"This net is nothing like what the pictures shows! Its very small and would not hold but maybe two or three medium stuff animals. The net is not stretchy at all but the edges around the net are. Its not worth the money at,the hooks are not a secures as i would like for even as little as it does hold! Hope this helps!"
2,dissapointing,i didnt get any sucktion cups with it. so i had to hang it up in my kids room and it is way bigger than i thought so i am glad i put it there. there is no way it would fit well in the bathtub
1,Completely worthless purchase,"Even with larger wall anchors (purchased separately from the hardware store), these nets just fell right out of the wall, leaving holes that had to be patched and painted (with paint purchased separately from the hardware store). So our $10 nets cost us an additional $25 in supplies to fix the damage they did. Live and learn."
4,Good product!,I have to start by admitting that I was a stuffed animal fan long before my daughter was born and wish that I had something like this years ago. It installs easily and holds my collection plus the one that I'm starting for her. Great product.
4,Holds great!,"My son is a stuffed animalaholic. He has so many I had to buy this net, and we counted he's got 42 stuffed animals in this netting, and 4 of them are huge! (Taller than my 2' son). I highly recommend this item if you're tired of looking at stuffed animals everywhere. I'm about to purchase another one, because he has since found more! lol"
4,toy hammock is great,It fits all of her stuffed animals which is a plus since she had sooo many. We got the package pretty fast too.
4,Net,I didn't care for the design of this net as much as my other one. It was hard to find a good way to position it and get the animals to sit correctly on it.
5,Perfect!,"The best few bucks I've spent in a long time! Exactly what I was looking for. Now my daughter has about a fifth of her bedroom floor back, and I'm no longer stressed out over the mess! Wish I would have thought to buy one years ago."
5,HUGE,I did not expect this to be as big as it is. It holds so much and I still have room to put more.
5,rede,"muito boa para guardar os bichos de pelucia, pode ser colocado em qualquer altura. Vem com instrues e os ganchos também esto inclusos"
4,Just what I needed,"The toy hammock was just what I needed for my daughter's nursery. Being that space is limited in her room, I have a great place to store all of her stuffed animals. Its been hanging on the wall for about 5 months now and it hasn't leaned or fall out of the nails. Assemble is a little time consumimg but once you get the right angles its perfect! This is a great guy for a great price!"
3,Very stretchy,"It is a very stretchy netting material. Almost not functional. We had to pull it very far apart in the corner so that it would hold anything. Still only holds about 10 stuffed animals. And they really just want to fall out of the front. Im still using it but if i had the choice, i would have bought one that doesnt give so much."
3,Stretches,The stretchy material this is made out of causes it to sag low on the wall. Other then that it is ok.
3,net for toys,"i bought this because my son has alot of stuffed animals and i dont know what to do with all of them! lol this product is helpful i just wish it had more elastic, the net seems flemsy."
2,Horrible anchors,The anchors that came with the hammock are horrible. They wont stay in place. My daughter just reached out to pick some stuffed toys and screws came off with anchors. Very flat and thick anchors. A very poor job.
5,Very cute,"I put my 22 month old's toy balls in here. It holds all of them and my 5 year old's basketball (don't ask lol) easily. It was easy to install - with a drill of course, not included (haha!). I know the competing brand (name?) has much worse reviews. I don't know about that brand but Prince Lionheart's toy hammock works great!"
4,Holds lots,"A lot of reviews on here say this hammock doesn't hold that many toys, but I have about 40-50 medium/regular sized stuffed animals hanging in this thing and it has done great. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because of the way they give you to hang it up. It is one of those screw hooks and they leave huge holes in your wall when you take it out."
2,Did not end up using,"We did not end up using this hammock and just hung a shelf to hold his stuffed animals instead. It's not that he has too many stuffed animals as it is that this hammock really sags. I see now that the picture shows this, but our ceilings aren't high enough to prevent my 2 yr old from hanging from it. This may work in an older child's room."
3,Hammock,"wasnt as i expected. it good, keep all stuffed animals in place, but doesnt strech out as says. Toys are off floor so its okay"
3,Play net,This play net is alright I guess. However the ceiling/wall anchors are really cheap and didn't easily instal. I don't think I'd buy this product for my second child. I'll get better quality and spend a bit more money
3,It was okay...,"The hooks that came with this hammock were too thick and very damaging to your walls. It's able to hold a lot, but the net is still pretty flimsy. It's not worth $8."
5,Works Great,"This works great, a little streachy, but was what we needed to get my sons stuffed animals off the floor and his bed. We mangaged to fit at least 5 large and 50+ mediuma and small into it."
5,Hammock,Very nice product. Good quality. Easy to install. I use it for my dorm room because I have the top bunk and I keep all my blankets and extra pillows in it.
5,"Large, Easy to install!","My daughter had so many stuffed animals taking over her room, bed and the toy boxes. I had bought a doll net before that lasted about a year. It was too small and the netting was poorly constructed. This one was perfect! It is HUGE. It also comes with the hardware and is very easy to hang. I recommend this for anyone who needs a place for the animals and dolls taking over their house!"
4,Great space saver!,Product is great for storing all those stuffed animals your child somehow aquires! We Hung ours in our 1 year olds room in the corner above her bed. You would be surprised how much it can actually hold. Definitely recommend.
4,"Good, but too small","I was looking for a net to hold all of my Squishable plushies. I have over 20 right now and as they are large they take up a lot of room. I also have other various plushies that people have given me over time.I was looking for baby shower gifts when I stumbled across this Jumbo net, and being only a couple of dollars, I decided to buy it and try it out. I knew 6 feet would only hold a few of my plushies, but I didn't think it would only hold 3 plus 2 smaller stuffed animals without things falling out.For my uses, not so great. It saved me some room, but not a lot. If you have normal sized plushies, you should do fine, probably can fit maybe 15 or more. It only sinks a bit with my set up, and I can walk under it without it hitting me (I'm 5'4). I'll continue to look for a better net, but for now this will do."
4,HUGE!,"I looked everywhere for one of these and finally ordered from Amazon alongside Christmas gifts this year. I was pleasantly surprised at how big it was. It's actually a little TOO big for my little guy's nursery, but I adjusted the corners to a nice fit. Great item for a great cost."
4,Holds a lot of stuffed animals!,We really needed to get our stuffed animals off the floor where they covered the entire room. This fit the bill perfectly and held all our stuffed animals!
5,Perfect,This was exactly what we were looking for. It was easy to put up and is currently holding about 30 stuffed animals. It really helped me get some of the kid clutter in order.
3,Had to buy different anchors.,The product is exactly as it is shown. The anchors they send with it are weak. I would recommend you buy stronger and bigger anchors and hooks.
4,Stuffed animals finally have a home!,"Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy HammockNow my daughter has a way to tame all those wild stuffed animals all over her room. The netting is made of a sturdy material, and I think they will hold up to holding all of her stuffed animals in an organized way!"
5,Space Saver,"I love this product as it gets all of her stuffed animals off the floor! It is high enough that her chair can fit under it, and large enough to fit large stuffed animals. I am very happy with the toy hammock!"
5,good product,"I bought this product because, even at the age of 23, I still have many stuffed animals. Most of which are stuffed Garfields, ranging in age from more or less current back to when Garfeild came out. I DID have them in a garbage sack sitting on the floor of my bedroom, and when I decided to go on a cleaning binge, I decided to purchase this item. When I took it out of the package, it appeared much smaller than I anticipated, but when it is up upon the wall, it holds a fair amount of ""toys"". The photo is misleading, because it MUST be showing tiny toys. In spite of that, this product still hold all of my beloved Garfields and then some."
4,works great,"I bought this for a place to store my pilates balls, it works great! They're up off the floor and not rolling around everywhere. I was pretty easy to put up too."
5,LARGE size!,"I bought this to put all the stuffed animals she doesnt play with, in the corner of her room. Its GREAT! Large and sturdy. It matches her white furniture and her ""fish"" themed room. I would recommend this to friends :-)"
4,Great organizer!,"I could never get my 3 year old to pick up all of the stuffed animals in her room until we purchased this product. The hammock is a ""bed"" for her stuffed animals and she picks all of the animals up and puts them to bed. GREAT product.Good quality and includes mounting materials. Super easy to install."
4,VERY stretchy,"I ordered two jumbo-sized hammocks because my kids have way too many toys. Honestly, this hammock was almost too big and stretchy. I placed it near the ground for easy access for the kids, but had to keep moving it up because everything made it sink to the floor. I'm very pleased, though, and surprised that this actually is ""jumbo,"" as stated. If I ever need to purchase more of these or order replacements, I'm definitely going with the same hammocks because it makes the out of control toy collection look like I have just a few.The material of the hammocks is a nicely done and good quality polyester; they should both last for a long time with continued use. The rope (mesh? I'm not sure what to call it!) is very sturdy, stretchy and durable. I love the product, but I'm not sure I accounted very well for the size. ""Jumbo,"" in relation to children, is usually such a loose term. Normally everything is just too small. Not this!"
5,Great Product,Product was exactly what we expected. This is a large hammock that holds a lot of animals. It was very easy to set up and is a great spacesaver.
3,It works,"Doesn't fit as many stuffed animals as the pic appears. Can't put ant of our daughters big stuffed animals n it, just the medium and little sized ones."
1,Do not believe the other reviews,"This ""animal hammock"" is terrible. I purchased it based on some of the reviews that stated that a lot of animals (sometimes up to 50) would fit in the hammock. That is simply untrue. I put this up in my daughters room and it barely holds 5 animals of decent size. The front is very flimsy and the animals just fall out. We had to purchase a different type of stuffed animal holder because this one is woefully inadequate. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE this hammock."
3,Needs better anchors...,"The overall functionality of the product is adequate. The included ""anchors"" leave a lot to be desired. After installing the included ""anchors"", the weight of just a few stuffed animals pulled the ""anchors"" out of the wall. When I used plastic aftermarket anchors, the hammock held a full complement of stuffed animals without incident."
5,Prince Lionheart Toy Hammok,"This was a GREAT buy. It holds SO much more than I expected. ankors were easy to install, hammok is sturdy, doesnt spill over. I seriously am not exadurating when I say..it HOLDS alot!!! The picture of this product with animals in it...double that and your close to what I have in ours...the girls LOVE it!"
3,Toy Hammock,"After a year of having 2 of these, they are really starting to sag. And I'm no atuffed animal hoarder. Seems like I have to find a way to stretch them out far, but I don't really know if that will help. My 3 year old son can reach it and pull it down now, because it's saggy :( Like a woman who ages. But for the price ,I shouldn't complain."
3,It's just OK,"It is really small for a ""jumbo"" net. Not much more than a pillow pet fits in it. Also, I know that they hang lower when you put stuff in them but damn! It's almost hangs down onto his bed and it is hung a good 4 feet over the bed in a corner."
5,Large sturdy net,Product came as described and can hold a lot of items. Installation was easy and quick. Would recommend this item
2,how do i hang this thing so it doesnt look stupid!!??,Received this in the mail today and tried hanging it so i can put my daughters stuffed animals in it and it looks so awkward on the wall. The HAMMOCK is HUGE! You need ALOT of wall space to hang.
5,Absolutley love it,"I had no idea there is a product like this which can make your soft toy collection look even cuter!! Super easy to install and has been hanging for last one month, no issue, no sagging. Its holding more than 30 soft toys all of diff shapes and sizes"
4,Decent toy net,It does well I do not think it is as big as I first had thought but over all it as really good toy net
3,Doesn't hold too many animals but good quality so far,"I bought this for my sons hundreds of stuffed animals. You hang it with screws so I was hesitant where to hang it. I only hung it on the underside of his bunk bed for now! it is really stretchy and doesn't hold that many animals , just a few of his beanbag sized ones and then it really droops, but I am sure it could hold more. It is an ok item , just wish it would hold more."
5,Finally a solution to the clutter!,"My daughter's room was being overrun by stuffed animals. I can't believe how many this holds! It held temendously to get them all up and off the floor. Now there is room for the rest of her toys and it's doesn't look cluttered. VERY easy to hang, VERY sturdy!"
1,Misleading,"""JUMBO"" toy hamock? I'd hate to see the small size. The photo in the ad must be of 1"" stuffed animals because this hammock holds not more than 3 (three) 8"" stuffed animals. Ridiculous. It is smaller than the toy hammock you can buy at the dollar store! Won't be buying anything from Prince Lionheart again."
1,Does not work,Bought this in early April and have finally gotten around to putting them up and they do NOT work. I can't even get 3-4 stuffed toys in it without it just flipping out the front. Really disappointed I cannot return them because I had removed them from the box 3 weeks ago to instal and then did not have the right size drill bit for the anchor... so had to wait. So upset.
2,ehhh.,"I thought this would be great for the kids rooms because we have such a small house. The only problem is that the hooks were too big to use, and I had to get different hooks. Then my 3 year old found it extremely easy to rip them out of the wall. It also takes up a huge amount of space in a corner. It also sinks A TON! I put it at my shoulder level and it sinks down to my daughter's height. I don't even use them. I kinda feel like they are cheap crap."
2,mislead,This is not what I expected. In the picture the hammock has suction cups. what I recieved has nails. I cannot attach this to the tiled walls in my bathroom. Disappointed.
1,I regret this purchase,"I didn't want to put 3 big holes into the wall, so I tried to use adhesive hooks and they didn't last long. While they were there, I tried filling it with stuffed animals, and it didn't hold very many. So I'm glad I didn't commit to the holes before I tried it out. I later purchased a hanging mesh storage closet organizer for the stuffed animals and it works great. No holes in the walls, she still gets to enjoy all her stuffed animals, and holds bigger animals without it flipping over like the hammock."
1,Disappointed!,This hammock had awful instructions. Stretched awkwardly and is definitely bigger than I expected. It drooped so bad I had to stretch it way too far and it doesn't hold stuffed animals well. So disappointed.
2,"Cheap, and you get what you pay for.","I purchased 3 types/brands and this is by far the worst. It is not elastic and sags horrible no matter how you install it. So when packed full of animals, the others looks great while this one sags, streches and look horrible. It looks like it will fall down any minute, even though it wont. Buy the ones that dont have elastic!"
3,Not bad. Not good.,"Had problems putting the toys in after we got it hung up. They wanted to roll out the front. Is it too stretchy? Solved the problem by sticking various ears, paws and tails through the back side to hold the animals and arrange them so they looked cute. The 3-year old loves having her ""friends"" watch her while she sleeps."
4,Wish there were a couple more titles,"Nice, small selection of popular 80's hits. Collection seems a little short with only 6 videos.Titles included in this set are:""Take on Me"" a-ha (1985)""Love Shack"" B-52's (1989)""Drive"" The Cars (1984)""Whip It"" Devo (1980)""Keep Your Hands To Yourself"" Georgia Satelites (1986)""New Sensation"" INXS (1987)"
1,another deceptive title,"Hits of the 80's sounds like a lot of videos from the 80's, not true, there are just 6 videos. Reading the description on the item when I bought it that info was kept a secret."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"When I bought this item I was thinking that I'd receive 2, but, when I open the package has only 1. It isn't ""2 Pack""."
4,clear book but you'll have to type the code.,"This is a clear book on an interesting subject. Computational geometry is a(nother) field where designing object oriented programs is so natural. Examples are clear, explanations also, with a good level of mathematical formalism.I deplore however that source code is not provided with the book on disk or on the internet. You will have to type the code you want to test.The paper of the cover is too thin to protect the book."
2,Poor writing manages to make an interesting life boring,"This book covers an interesting life story and has great detail, but unfortunately much of that detail has nothing to do with Mr. Fleming's life, instead focusing on the bloodlines of every British person he ever met. A typical sentence would read ""While at the party Ian met John Blankenship of Eddileshile, who would later become the Duke of Ipswitch and marry the Dutchess of Flem, whose mother, the Dame of Foppishnich, once had lunch with Sir Henry Handllberg"" - and NONE of these people would have had anything to do with the story, the party, or Ian Flemming. It is as if a Flemming biography was inadvertantly been mixed with a ""Complete Peerage of the Brittish Isles"" and they went ahead and published it anyway. If you must, get the print version, so you can skim over the irrelevant stuff that pops up every other sentence - if you listen to the Audible audio version (like I did) you will find it had to follow and boring to boot."
2,Disappointing,"This book starts out interesting enough, but soon the plot devolves. Obvious questions go unanswered. And in the end, the book does not come to a satisfactory conclusion. I found it unfulfilling."
1,toxic,Affixed to the electrical cord is a label that says that the cord is coated with a material that is toxic and also causes reproductive harm. Too bad the cord wasn't made with an adapter - it is built into the machine. Guess you could just put batteries in it and not use the electrical cord at all but still you would have to wash your hands everytime you touched it. Why do people make toxic toys?Also there isn't a headphone jack.
1,"Cute, but TOXIC cord that reads to WASH HANDS after handling","THis is a very cute CD player, but after I read the ""toxic"" waring on the electrical cord to wash your hands after handling and that it can cause reproductive harm--we returned ours. I don't understand why they would make such a product for children to use???"
5,Exciting Coming of Age Story,"Wise, profound, exciting and beautifully written coming of age story by a prize winning international author.I recommend this book with 5+ stars."
4,Great read,A beautifully written book - not too wordy like some books that rely on adjectives to take up space on the page. It flows nicely and gave my imagination beautiful scenery in my mind's eye. Thank goodness I read it over the long holiday weekend because I could read late into the night and start back up again 1st thing in the morning. I can't wait for the next one!!!
5,Wonderful fantasy/adventure novel,"I found this book to be a wonderful fantasy/adventure story about a young women's quest to fulfill her destiny. Very descriptive imagery, I felt as though I could easily visualize what the author was conveying. It was also very refreshing to read about a strong women character with high morals. This can be a great inspiration for young adult readers and I would highly recommend it."
1,Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time,wouldn't work on my apple mac like was told. also I didn't get the change to send it back so I could get my money back. Gloria K freestone
1,Never worked!,"I love Carmen San Diego & was so excited to get this for my kids. However, it never worked properly. We didn't even get the game to start w/o crashing. Same happened w/ other Carmen San Diego games. Bummer!!!"
1,program won't run,"Again, a big waste of money. My daughter loved the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego that we bought through Scholastic, so I thought I would treat her to a few other Carmen Sandiego videos. This product won't even install. It gets caught up when trying to load the Quick Time feature. I am very dissapointed with Space Bound for selling us ""brand new"" garbage."
4,A learning adventure filled with excitement,"Carmen has done it again, packing learning into an exciting adventure. Carmen has taken her villains back in time to steal priceless historical treasures.The mission, travel to the past, solve any historical problems that Carmen's crew cause, and catch the villains.The adventure will have you wrapping mummies in ancient Egypt, repairing pipes in Rome, traveling with Columbus and much more.Recommended age level 9+ but we found it easy enough for a six year old with minimal help."
2,Training schmaining,"The book is called Rachael's Training and that is a cheat. It is about a couple of girls who enjoy being spanked and have male companions who enjoy doing it. No training is involved at all. They pick locations and swap partners, and it is cheerfully enough written, but deep down it is soft porn at its most vanilla. I was so bored I can't even remember getting to the end, so if there is something startling there I apologize. But I doubt it."
2,Platitudes and useless definitions,"Of all the business literature I have read during my MBA this was definitely one of the least beneficial or inspiring. It gives very few useful models or theories, much of its information is much too obvious to be interesting and it uses examples that are either wrong in facts or don't really support the theories of the book. You will have forgotten about most of it as soon as you put it away but don't be sorry for that, this book would never help you achieve better operations anyway.The sand cone theory described briefly in thios book but better elsewhere is one of few interesting and useful theories of the book. Forget about the operating strategy matrix, you won't be able to make any use of that in any organisation."
3,Overated,Overpriced for glorified masking tape. We Hope it sticks well on cold packages and plastic freezer containers. Standard address labels would work as well..
5,FoXtRoT RoCkS!!!!!!!! This is a great comic book series,"In this foxtrot, Jason's nintendo breaks!... THey go on a trip to cactus flats... Peter tries to join ""American Gladiators""... Read the book to find out more. This is a best comic book series. As good as Garfield and Calvin and HObbes (Maybe better) NOT A WASTE OF MONEY"
4,Great book for first grade,This book helped me introduce more than and less than relation symbols. Also it is easy enough for some of my students to read on their own.
5,The Second Bill of Rights,"My first semi-legalese book. Quick and easy read, and very inspiring. The professor makes an excellent case. Who needs to amend the Second Bill to the Constitution? Just adopt it America. If you will it, its yours."
1,Don't buy it but if you have it broken - it's an easy fix.,"Around 14 months after I purchased this TV the power went off.When I was buying it I did not do any research, just went to Circuit City and bought it. After it went out I was reading reviews online and found the cause. Blown fuse. DO NOT TAKE IT TO A TV REPAIR PLACE. DO IT YOURSELF. The whole repair takes 5 minutes, excluding a trip to Radioshack, if you have just basic $10 tool set. Remove the rear cover, locate the fuse by the power cord, replace it with the good fuse and put the rear cover back.If you can lift this TV - you can fix it."
1,Do not buy,"I have bought this model brand new and it died on me after 4 months. It just stopped powering on. Apperntly it is a fault with the model itself but Philips refuses to accept responsability. Although the warranty covers parts, but you get stuck with paying for labour and having the hastel to transport it to and from the local repair shop that Philips recommends. I truely recommend not considering this TV."
1,Stay Away,"TV stops working about 15 days after warranty expires. I cannot believe Philips hasn't done anything about this. Costs $150-200 to ""maybe"" fix as there is a well-known circuit problem on the board. Piece of heavy junk."
2,Has Short Lifetime,"I had this TV for 2 and a half years, and suddenly it turned off, and from then, everytime I turn it on, its green light will come on and then off constantly. The fuse is not damaged, though, rather an internal board part. It has a very low life time for a TV. Also, when it was working it had a long delay for the picture to come, as well as when switching channels. The quality of picture was good though."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!,"This TV should not even get 1 star. I bought this TV in September 2005 and it is now May 2006 and the TV will not turn on.After this happened, I did some research on the internet and have found that this problem has happened to thousands of people. This TV is defective.Philips will not take responsibility for this problem.I MUST STRESS DO NOT BUY THIS TV!"
5,Great Dvd,Nashville Pussy live is awesome and these dvd is no exception. THEY FREAKIN ROCK! Should be alot more popular than they are.
2,N/P -WERE THEY IN PARIS?,TOO FRANTIC CAMERA ACTION- THEIR OTHER VIDEO WAS 500% BETTER.i'M NOT SURE THEY WERE EVEN IN PARIS MORE THAN 5 MINUTES AND THIS VIDEO WAS 64 MINUTES LONG
3,the only bright light for the Texans!!,"This light is easy to use after reading the instructions, It adds plenty of light to the room at night so that I don't trip when I get up to eat cake and stuff. It's kinda cute. They need a Black version also. And maybe Asian."
5,A classic,"This is a classic boat shoe at a great price. I could not be happier with this product. The sizing is perfect (and I'm a size 14)! The delivery was very quick (two days). And the quality is excellent. A ""Home Run"" as far as I'm concerned. Highly recommended."
2,a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and warranty,This product is not designed or built to the usually high Sony standards. The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty.
1,Shotty workmanship,"The LCD had over 20% pixel death right out of the box. When I took it back to the Sony Style store they refused to honor the warranty. I have sent the notebook back to Sony, and they say it will be $699.99 to replace the screen plus another $99.99 diagnostic fee.Not long ago Sony was the standard that all manufacturing aspired to. It is sad to see how far they have fallen."
1,DON'T BUY THIS - ESPECIALLY FROM BEST BUY!,"I recently bought this laptop from Best Buy. It took hours on end to update itself online. It comes prepackaged with tons of trial software and sony software that slows the computer down - some of which you can't uninstall. The screen flickers upon start up and shut down. The computer freezes with more than one application open at t time. It is a piece of junk. Within two days I tried to return it at Best Buy and they charged me a $345 dollar restocking fee because apparently this isn't ""defective."" It was a horrible, expensive experience. Don't make this mistake. AND DON'T BUY FROM BEST BUY!!! Horrible company with horrible customer service."
1,Probably The Worst Christopher Lee Film,"And I have seen at least 150 of them. This is just bad, bad ,bad! Terrible effects, terrible camera work, cheesy lines. Just don't bother. This hardly even qualifies as a B movie. Hard to sit through; maybe a ZZZZ movie?"
3,Good Basics; Questionable Perspective,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a good book (or tape) for understanding the basics of Islam. But if the book was, in fact, updated in 1995, one has to question the objectivity of the author, who says, e.g., of Wahhabism: ""It is probably the most profound, and may yet prove to be the most beneficial, change that has supervened in Arabia since the preaching of Islam..."" (p.153)."
2,"A real snoozer, apologetic, and irrelevant post-9/11","Many are snapping up whatever they can read about Islam, driven by our desire to know more about our enemies who are trying to kill us. This book won't help. It's more of a sympathetic, scholarly treatment of Islamic culture and practice, not a primer that is in any way helpful in gaining perspective on militant, radical Islam. If you want to know more about mainstream Islamic practices and tenets, but aren't looking for a satisfactory answer to why so many Muslims hate America, Jews, and Christians, then by all means, buy this book."
3,"Good, but far from perfect","The first thing you notice is that this hub is impossibly small, and very cleanly designed. But once you plug it in the benefits of the size fade quickly...it gets incredibly hot very fast, probably because it is so small. It just doesn't seem like a good trade off. Go for a larger, more mainstream solution unless size is important."
2,Worked and then failed,I bought two of the hubs in June 2004. One of them failed in about a month of using it with a HP/Compaq Laptop. IOGEAR replaced it for me. I am now using it with a Dell Laptop and it seems to be doing fine. The other one I used with a Mac for about a year and a half now and it has failed. I am beyond warranty so I will go with a different hub to replace it. It does run hot so I think it must have good ventilation to hold up well.
2,Same as previous poster,"Uncanny, but my hub had the same problem - mine lasted for about 1 year, but now the middle two ports don't recognize devices.Wierd. When it worked I loved it, though."
3,Micro Miles,"Other than two minor flaws this hub does just fine. It would be nice if it could simply be system powered, as are others, without the need for A/C. Also the unit does need some ""cool down"" time before you put it away."
2,Hard crashes on Win2000,When used on a USB2.0 port on my Win2000 box it causesa hard crash during driver installation. Works OKin a USB1.1 port. Case does get quite warm during use.
2,"Great Idea, Bad Design.....",This was a great idea for a 4 port hup but it was it badly Designed.The cables were way to short. It seamed too hard to add more than two extra USB cables because the extra USB slots seemed too close to gether.Thats my two cents...
3,Holmes vs. Conspiracy?,"Taken separately, Plummer (too emotional) and Mason (too old) are miscast. But, their chemistry is excellent, though not as good as Rathbone and Bruce (fourteen films)or Cushing and Mills (""Masks of Death""). Frank Finlay may just be the best Lestrade. Most of the Holmes vs. Ripper film is quite good. Then comes the ending, with just about every discredited conspiracy theory ever offered thrown into one long-winded emotional speech by Holmes. Did the writers forget that in the stories brother Mycroft Holmes was the government?"
2,DVD Manufacturers Just Don't Care,"So far, this is the only forum I've located - beyond my local retail outlets - for my complaint about the quality of too many DVD's.I agree with the other reviewers and think this movie is truly one of the great illustrations of Holmes, but I have gone through a half dozen copies of this DVD from two local retail outlets and every one of them has a three-second stall in the transition from Chapter 14 to Chapter 15! So, I rate it 2-stars.I enjoy watching movies, but that enjoyment is ruined by this still scene of a steam locomotive rounding a curve at the beginning of the chapter!I encounter this phenomenon in fully 10% of the DVD's I buy. I don't want another disc in exchange; I don't want my money back. I want the manufacturers to pay more attention to quality control."
2,Have any of the rave reviewers ever actually read the Holmes cannon?,"The movie was OK, if a little dragging. I expected it to drag a bit because the traditional Holmes stories are rather slow and contain far more expostulation than action. That's fine. I was even vaguely willing to accept the psychic, because although Holmes does not involve the supernatural, Conan Doyle was a believer.Then Holmes was moved to tears. Holmes! Crying! This moved me to turn the movie off, throw it in its envelope and get it out of my house. Sorry. Holmes does not cry."
1,Just plain awful.,"I carefully read the reviews of this film before purchasing the dvd. All I can say is that they must be reviews of another film. This is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes films I have ever seen, which says a lot when you think of some of the black and white stinkers that are out there.Apparently , according to this film London consists of about three streets and is occupied by about five people. Plummer played more of a man in The Sound of Music then he does in this film.This Holmes is constantly falling down and getting knocked out. Stick with the likes of Without a Clue or Young Sherlock Holmes."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The production values of this Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper film are decent but Plummer and Mason never seem comfortable in their roles and the movie goes through the motions of a Royal conspiracy without ever engaging the viewer; unless you're a Ripperphile who's already seen From Hell, there's little reason to make time for this turgid bore."
2,Doesn't hold up,"Personally I get tired of the current movies with their hyper-kinetic MTV editing and pacing (see From Hell). So I am more than open to the movies from 10-20 years ago where the pace was a little more relaxed. But even having said that, this movie is still TOO slow, and TOO talky. The cast is fine, though as other people have mentioned James Mason is perhaps 10 years too old for his role. And a personal pet peeve: it annoys me when you have a period piece film but then the actors have contemporary hair cuts. Christopher Plummer's hairstyle is circa 1980 and NOT 1880 as it should be."
2,Not true to the spirit of Conan Doyle,"The problem with MURDER BY DECREE is simply this: That it is a product of a sensationalistic screenwriter who, while deeply influenced by a late 20th-century revulsion against the abuses of power, cooks up a plot way out of whack with the material that one finds in the original Conan Doyle. No more on this for fear of being a spoiler. I say sensationalistic because of the Hollywood emphasis on blood and gore and violence against women. Some of this is stomach-turning. Conan Doyle would have hated the film's lack of the decorum that his works observed. This really isn't for people who cherish Sherlock Holmes within the sensibility of the Edwardian era, which sidesteps the sickening in its thrill-seeking."
3,Joe The Ripper,"Anchor Bay surely cannot know what it is like to want to replace your ageing vhs only to find that some philistian with a blunt pair of scissors has butchered the best scenes. It's only 30 seconds but that is a lot in the circumstances. It's amateurish and shows apparent disrespect for Film as an art form - would the person who did this be prepared to pay full whack for a slashed portrait of Amber Heard? In its favour this movie is atmospheric and the five victims are otherwise presented historically accurately with much of the filming in London. The substitution of Plummer's Holmes for Abberline works quite well. If you enjoy this version try Blood And Black Lace, Fistful Of Dollars, Schizo and Black Sunday(La Maschera Del Demonio)- have a good time kids. Seriously folks, distributors and dvd studios should think again before going for a more lenient classification without making a NR available."
4,Superb Sherlock Holmes Thriller,"Christopher Plummer and James Mason are brilliant as Holmes and Watson, respectively. In fact, Mason's Watson is the best version to appear on the silver screen. The sequence with his dinner and the peas is just fantastic. The mystery is a little uneven, but the movie proceeds at a suspenseful pace and the ending is masterful."
1,One only because I can't give it a zero,"One of the worst movies I've ever endured. Ridiculous plot, poor writing, bad acting. Need I say anything else? The best thing about this film is the London fog."
1,Self Promotion for Producer.,"Nothing but self-important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age, as mere snipnets of what I thought was going to be a movie were shown. Very disappointing, as listing didn't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped!"
2,No table of contents,"Thomas Goodwin is great puritan to read but with no table of contents I would not think about buying this kindle version, there would be no easy way to find the work you want to read."
2,Eastern Approach with all its Eeriness.,"It is very Japanese - the very essence of the Japanese Shintoism. If you are familiar with classic Japanese music, you'd at once recognise this. It is eerie, it is mysterious, it is very abstract to Western ears, but no secret to a pair of eastern ears like mine.To what extent is such the intention of Debussy, I am left to wonder.However, if you consider that this is an acceptable approach, this is still a very decent performance.I personally would opt for other more convincing Western intepretations."
2,Low Budget Ameature!!,"I can't believe I paid for $14.99 for this. With the previews, I thought I was getting a fresh Thai martial arts + dancing + popping movie, but it turned out to be the lamest martial arts movie ever. You know, the low budget kung fu type where all you see are flying kicks and more kicks. Not much hand to hand b/c these kids don't know real martial arts. Also, can we find better looking actors and actresses? I mean, geesh.... And OMG, what an unoriginal storyline, so friggin boring! This is one of those low budget first time movie types for whoever produced it. I don't know much about Thai pop-culture, but if these kids in this movie want their careers to excel, then they're seriously mistaken, b/c this is the type of movie that will ruin any start-up Thai actor. Poor acting, poor action scene, low-budget, average looking actors at best = a poor movie!!!!! Let me sum this up by saying that this movie is again unoriginal and boring."
2,OK but not a 3,"Typical 50s special? effects. A new redue would be great! Want real spider effects get Eight Legged Freaks! We need more spider movies! How about a black widow and forget tarantulas,their not scary any more."
1,Avoid This Drive,"Nothing but errors and coasters. Does not seem to properly write to DVD-R discs. Works fine for DVD+R, but will not work at all for DVD-R. Tech support at Iomega blamed the software company, the blank media and so on, but had no clue what was really happening.If you need DVD-RAM, stick to Panasonic, since they created it. For all others, just avoid this drive."
1,update on last review,"Well, after couple days of messing around with this drive I have given up. Software does not work, wont read dvd-rom (movies), wont read dvd-ram discs, only thing it does do is create music cd's (could buy a cd burner for 20 bucks). Will be returning this item on Monday. Techinal support does not help, not worth wasting your time with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,CLAM CHOWDER,"Twelve string guitar music has always been Home for me. This Solid Air Records disc is warm and comfortable. Tracy Moore himself seems an affable type with above average composing and playing skills. Americana hits with his live version of Foster's Old Folks at Home that he's calling Swanee River Boogie. Several of his other titles like Mumbles the Cat, The Dilettante Sidestep, and Bob Takes His Truck to the Dump display a sense of humor necessary to live the life of a solo twelve string guitar performer. It's rare that one exists or can exist in our otherwise occupied country. Acoustic Music Resource is where I found this record--they have an incredible inventory and I've been going there since they started. Tracy Moore: the Collection is a great place to be in the acoustic guitar world."
5,WOW! Great deal!,"Buying this nativity scene for my Sister. If anyone has other pieces, particularly the ox, please list them!"
2,Challenge without answers,"Easum and Bandy make excellent points regarding the difficulties of traditional churches. Who can argue with the reality of decline; the substitution for institutional maintenance for evangelism? Unfortunately their response to the challenge is gimmicky and shallow. For example, they envision ""worship"" consisting of chats with a holographic Jesus and Mary on the challenges of family life. Is such a retreat into entertainment the only way to reach today's generation? Is it even possible for such entertainment to be authentic worship, or have we settled for a Disneyland version of reality? The authors don't consider such questions, nor do they address the question of resources, envisioning the megachurch, with its wealth, to be the only option for the future. Current trends indicate the future is not quite so monolithic. There are other books tackling these issues with far more practical advice."
4,Great Detail,"I've been using procmail in a basic way for a number of years. Whilst I've always meant to get around to using some of the more complicated (and useful) tools in the procmail toolbox, I've always been discouraged by the man pages.This book explained those areas wondefully, and also showed me quite a few possibilities that had never occurred to me.I think this book would be useful even if you already know procmail pretty well.It would have got 5 stars, except for a couple of typos (involving quotes) that should have been caught. Mostly excellent!"
3,Fine for outdoors,"I was looking for something that would have decent sound and easy to install for outdoors. Traditional speakers would have had to been mounted to wall but all I had to do with these was put them on the ground. The packing to the item from the manufacturer sucks. Had some chips in the ""rock"" but fortunately had some similarly colored caulk to fix it. Pretty good design of sealing off the speaker cable attachments from rain, dust, etc. The sound is very decent, great for the price. Now just gotta wait and see how it holds up to the Vegas heat."
4,"Good, inexpensive outdoor speakers...","The color and look is good. Not exactly rock-like because of the flat, sloped front, but they blend in well. The sound is a little too bright, but some tone control can balance them out. The bass doesn't go very low, but they are relatively small and only cost $92. Overall, a good product and a good value."
3,Safty chain,The Product was of standard quality. The price however was 1/4 that of local suplies. I will gladly use this suplier on my next run of my product.
3,Taste odd but filling,"These arrived at my house badly melted and a complete mess to eat, but I tried one anyway. They taste like peanut butter soaked in a lot of chemicals with soy crunchies. Not very appetizing at all. I did stay full for about 3-4 hours, but there are better things to eat."
5,Sweet and Filling,These are covered with chocolate that provides a sweet counterpoint to the peanut butter. It is a very filling bar with a nice texture (rather than to waxy one most protein bars have)and is not sickly sweet. It is a nice morning snack that gives a great boost of energy and sneeks in a couple more hours before you have to stop for lunch. If I could give them 10 stars I would.
2,Horrible Flavor but Good Protein,This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms (partially allergic). I assume it's the soy based product coming out in it since it's vegan and doesn't use any other source of protein. I gave it an extra star (bumped up from 1 star) since it does provide protein and that's essentially what I wanted. I ended up returning it since it tastes horrible.
4,Useful,"I will keep it for many years. Sometimes it is good to come back to the basics and review what you are doing with your company's ""blood"""
4,Must Read for Undergrads,This is an excellent book that I wish that I would have read as an undergrad and applied to some of my smaller ventures. The book is straight-forward and articulately explains the concepts that I personally took for granted. The examples were not exactly challenging but they compelled me to think about how I create a much more sophisticated model based on the principles illustrated. Simply a great read and a solid tool to help you create a better organization.It's a must read for any aspiring entrepreneur!
4,Fantastic sequel!!!,"Col. Glenn Manning, from THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, is back, and after his fall from the top of Boulder Dam, is a hideously scarred, out of control monster, with no recollection of his previous life. The story centers on the giants sister trying desperately to bring him out of his madness, and keep the authorities from destroying him. This sequel is more entertaining than its predecessor, with an exciting, and touching, conclusion. Classic 50's sci fi at its best!"
2,"slower, less interesting, and thin","This film fails to engage the viewer. Unlike the first one, the characters do not develop, there is no humor whatsoever, and the beast is just a brainless brute run amok rather than a military hero under severe and tragic stress. This one isn't even suspenseful or scary, it just kind of plods along: he is found, subdued, escapes, and meets his end.Not recommended."
3,or less stars...am. col. mn 2,"at start of film-y not show at least a giant hand or foot or the whole thing approachin the movin mex. teenangler p/u. 1st visit-ok,1st capture-ok and show it 1st breakin out w/ damage at the airport and again when it finally got away from the airport and damage along the way to the end-the observatory. i think this was all the action scenes---could have had more visual monster action; they have the monster y not use it more---$? the monsta or studio finally took him out so no more pt 3 of types."
2,So-so.,"The hymns are very competently done, but there doesn't seem to be any energy or excitement to what they are doing. It's okay, but I wouldn't have purchased it had I heard it ahead of time. I got it based on a complimentary review--obviously, I'm not quite in agreement."
1,WARNING for OS X users,"If you use OS X and buy this you will wind up pulling your hair out and then in an out of the way Iomega support page(http://www.iomega.com/software/cdrwdrivers.html) you will find the following statement ""Iomega HotBurn does not currently support Mac OS X or Mac OS 9.2.""THEN, they will try to sell you software at a ""special price"" only $34.95!Or you have to buy Toast for $89.95. Plus no DVD software.I wish I wasn't so cheap and had been willing to shell out the bucks for a Que Firewire drive."
3,average nothing speical,lets just say they work well enough .but there expensive for the price and there not high end equiptment but hey ya get what you pay for in life lol
1,I thought it was a joke... especially the tape!!,"I have studied Feng Shui for quite a while. I am not sure WHY they even included the tape, which basically says nothing...."
2,Nothing Special,"I was disappointed in this CD. The songs are somewhat ""blah"" and don't show off Carly Simon's wonderful voice. In the duet with Willie Nelson, it was as if they were both singing unaware that the other was there. I had high expectations, given that I still LOVE her older albums. Maybe my expectations were just too high..."
2,Have Yourself a Dreary Little Christmas........,"Gee, all she needs is a cover of ""The Christmas Shoes"" and this depressing cd would be complete.....I love Carly, but stay away from this, unless you're a HUGE fan and you need it to complete your collection. She can do much better."
3,Not To Be Confused...,"Not to be confused with last year's Christmas CD entitled ""Christmas Is Almost Here"" which showed a lot of originality and a nice duet with her son on God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen as well as a spirited duet with Willy Nelson on ""Pretty Paper."""
1,Re-release Rip Off !!,"Why are recording artists re-releasing albums with ""bonus tracks"". I bought this CD the first time only a few years ago. Already a new version?? As a Carly Simon fan, I am supposed to contribute to her retirement fund by purchasing the CD again!? I guess if Mariah Carey can re-release ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" 3 times each time with additional songs and sell 4 million copies, why not Carly. I think if an artist appreciated their fans, they would release new songs on a CD single or just a new CD. I feel ripped off. I will step off my soapbox now, but not re-purchase this CD. My Christmas CD this year will be from the Lovemongers!!"
3,slow and country twang like,I am a fan of Carly and her music. This CD is a bit of a disappointment for me. It has a country tone to it and I'm not a country fan. It is slow paced and will perhaps work well as background music during a holiday gathering. Willie Nelson is not a muscian I would listen to if I didn't have to. I was surprised he was a part of this CD.
3,Carly trips and slips into Christmas,"I Really was excited about 9 yrs ago, when i heard carly had recorded a christmas cd. Over these past Christmas seasons i have listened to the cd many times. I have loved carly for many years and i suppose now decades. Christmas is almost here, however is not carly at her best. I feel the cd lacks a certain joy and excitment that i like in Christmas music. The cd comes off as rather harsh and not well recorded. I should say i do enjoy a few of the tracks and will continue to listen to cd into the future. All in all i believe every artist has a slip or trip in their recording catalog and that just happens. I still remain a Carly Simon fan and that will not change."
3,great album-misleading advertising,"Being a big fan of Ms. Simon, I wasted no time purchasing this product last year....so when I saw it on amazon.com, with a special bonus song that I didn't have, I thought I'd order it again. Great album....no bonus song."
2,A Quick One...,"This album seems like it was recorded quickly. With it's minimalist instrumental backing, and heavy use of keyboards, it sounds like little care was taken to ""get it right"". The exception is the fine title track that shows son Ben inherited his parents ear for melody. Too bad the rest of the album is so poorly executed. The low point comes on Simon's duet with Willy Nelson on ""Pretty Paper""...rarely have two voices been so mismatched."
5,mr,works quite well and looks better. i like it very much and would recommend it to everyone. you go get it.
4,Porch ceiling fan,"Once again, great product, great service from Amazon. Very attractive fan, quiet, stable and moves a lot of air. Will do business with Amazon again"
1,Poor Quality - DON'T BUY HUNTER - CHEAP PLASTIC,"Don't buy these!! I bought 2 for my outdoor kitchen and it lasted 6 months. The first heavy rain storm that we had with a little wind (not tornado or hurricane force wind) and the blades came apart at the area that looks like metal but isn't. The fan is made of plastic, not just the leaf blade. The part that looks like metal and attaches the leaf blade to the fan is plastic....very misleading by the picture and description. I called Hunter and they won't replace the blades since they say it was an ""act of God"" issue. I told them the issue was they made outdoor fans of poor quality material and can't survive a basic rain storm and that ""act of god"" is generally used for tornadoes and tropical storms."
4,Had to wait a bit for it...,"Had to wait a bit for it (back order I guess), but all is well now. Easy install and works great!"
5,Hunter Bayview Fan,Fan is everything it said it was. The blades look like palm leaves. It gave a custom look to our family/sun room.
5,Porch Ceiling Fan,"I purchased this with the idea of having a fan that did not scream out 'notice me' over the other items on my porch. But with the textured blades I do get a tropical feel with great function. I am quite pleased.Hunter 23979 Bayview 54-Inch Five Blades Ceiling Fan, White Wicker Palm Leaf"
2,pull chain problem is not fixed,"We installed this fan on our outdoor patio just a week or two ago. Pull chain is a problem. I haven't figured out how to use it. Should I pull staight down, or stand to the side? Neither works well and it feels as if the chain is going to come right out of the housing. Not good for a brand new fan. I would look for an alternative."
2,I was warned...,Other reviewers noted the problem with the set screw stripping out and all I can say is I was warned. Otherwise the quality and finish seems fine. When I get time I will drill and tap for a slightly larger and better quality set screw. Such a simple and cheap fix is needed to make customers happy and this company just doesn't want to step up and do it.
3,The screw,"The tightening screw needed to be re-tightened after a couple of clips. other than that, it works great in directing the sound"
5,Excellent for any educator,"This book has been so helpful with creating card games, jeopardy games, focal points for word work instruction, basically practically any type of word activity or lesson- Very useful tool for any type of classroom!"
5,Love this!,This is a terrific resource to utilize and it covers a range of topics and for multiple ages. I am so glad I purchased this.
4,love this book,"I have been using the third edition for years, but it became mildewed from a classroom leak. I replaced it with this fifth edition download - no more mildew and the resource is at my fingertips."
2,Kindle version missing pages,The kindle version looks as if it was just slapped together. The graphics have been scanned terribly. Which seems to speak volumes for the quality of the rest of the content. The charts from the book are too small to read comfortably on the kindle. Those should have been typed and formatted just for the kindle version. The biggest sin is the missing list I found; which happened to be one I truely needed.
3,"""oTHER peoples' hereos, enjoyed it..*","This is a superhero comedy that has been revised and expanded. I have read it before, so I liked to new version with extra storyline, and new scene. The main character Josh is a reporter, and he is portrayed in a such a way that has a feeling of real life to him. There are other rich character portraits in this novel as well. What I liked is that this book is about comic heroes with an imaginative storyline. The novel has some twists, and felt like a unique superhero themed book. I enjoyed reading the story of Siegel city and am looking forward to reading more from this author.."
4,"Petit's debut ""Heroes"" worth a look","First off, I have to admit that super heroes and that genre have not been high on my reading topics since I was about 10. But upon a tip from a friend of mine, I obtained a copy of Blake Petit's ""Other People's Heroes"" and I can honestly say that I had a hard time putting it down. Petit's character development is very good and while he brings you into a situation that you obviously have never been in, but you can relate with the characters (much like Kevin Smith of View Askew fame). His storyline is solid and well developed with several small subplots to keep you constantly wondering what's going to happen next and what kind of curveball is waiting around the corner. The end has a sort of a ""Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"" feel to it which I feel helps relate the story that is obviously fiction to the true-to-life world around us. For a first-time effort, Petit's ""Other People's Heroes"" is a keeper."
3,"Awesome Concept, Lukewarm Execution","The idea of what's going on in Petit's novel is a great one, a layered superhero conspiracy mystery peppered with interesting characters. However, the writing was a bit unpolished. Petit has talent and imagination and I look forward to seeing him grow, but unless you're already a fan of superheros and don't mind the liberal application of cliches, you might enjoy this book. I bought it out of curiosity and for the price, I don't regret my purchase."
3,Good read!,"This book took me a while to really get into and I almost gave up on it a few times. Once I really got into it however, I really enjoyed this book. The characters are great, but the author doesn't really flesh them out too well and there are so many new and different characters, you forget who is who. The protagonist is likeable, but not always believable. I love the premise, and am looking to try out the sequel. Hopefully he builds on this platform and the characters are stronger and better defined."
4,Wanted to like it more...,"I wanted to like this more than I did- there are some great! elements, but about 2/3 of the way through the major villain was revealed and I got lost and it got too convoluted (no spoilers). Some of the plot points were too obvious. I liked the way the writer kept us guessing (lets face it ALL the 'great names' are taken, so there is some wonderful twist and turns). Some nice 'nods' as well (Siegel City and Kirby (square?) being two of them (thank you). I like the use of 'current time' as well (again some nice comments). A character with 'totems' was especially fascinating (well written/thought out).Maybe if a few plot points had simply been tightened/edited a bit?That said I would definitly (sp) buy a sequel if it ever happened. Glad that there is this type of fiction out there for the geeks. Thanks"
4,Fun and practical,The 8 inch Thai hotpot is an unusual but fun little item. I found the concept good but a bigger version could work more efficiently perhaps.
3,Better second time around,"When I originally read this book I found it difficult to follow and too full of confusing metaphorical language, however the charachters were quite realistically portrayed, and had 'real' emotions and thoughts. I am giving this book a second chance, so to speak, beacause after reading Dangerous Angels, which I highly recommend, I have a better understanding of Francesca Lia Block's writing style, and this has made Ecstasia easier to read and understand. Whilst this book is one of Francesca Lia Block's better works I would recommend reading any one of the Weetzie Bat books if you are new to Block's writing."
1,Terrible. Just Terrible.,"I am probably the biggest Francesca Lia Block fan you can find. I am always gushing about her books to all my friends and recomending her to everyone. So, you can imagine my dissapointment when I discovered the utter tripe that is Ecstasia and it's companion book Primavera. These books went out of print for a reason. Because they were horrible. What I have always loved about Block's books is her ability to blend fantasy with reality, and her awe-inspiring descriptive language. These two books have removed reality altogether, and what we are left with is overdone fluff with too much metaphor and no substance. Comparing these books to masterpieces like Violet and Claire, Echo or the Dangerous Angles series is like comparing a chocolate chip cookie to eating handfuls of sugar out of the bag."
2,Circle - Eddie Izzard concert,"very dissappointed in this concert. As a die hard E I fan I noticed that Eddie used old material, and was very full of himself in the pre concert interview. Because of this poor concert I didn't bother with the next ""Sexy""."
3,more amusing than practical,"If you are looking for a serious 'how to' book you might want to look elsewhere. If you are looking for a lighthearted and amusing read to help lighten your mood, then this might be just the book for you."
1,"OK for 20-somethings, still short on relationship experience","I was disappointed. It was not nearly as sage and nitty-gritty practical as the book, ""How to Dump your Wife"" (a gem,) but then marriage imposes more legal realities that require real assistance. This ""Guy"" book probably would have been more entertaining, as well as useful, in my 20's or even 30's. But for anyone over 35, one's real experiences, friends, family, movies, magazines, etc., have probably already covered most of those points, which were often presented tongue-in-cheek anyway. I considered it mostly ""fluff"" despite the promise of ""meat"" on the Today show interview and the Table of Contents. I wish I'd looked through it before buying it right off the shelf."
1,THANKS FOR ALLOWING A WAY FOR MY GIRLFRIEND TO DUMP ME.,"I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO HATE THE AUTHOR OR THANK THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK. BUT, AFTER MY [EX] GIRLFRIEND READ THE BOOK (given to her by her mother) SHE DUMPED ME. HEY, I DIDN'T READ THE BOOK, BUT CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF IT TALKS ABOUT GIVING SOMEONE TWO WEEKS WITH NO COMMUNICATION?FINALLY, WRITE A DAMN BOOK ON HOW TO DUMP A GIRL.(DAMN, STILL CAN'T BELEIVE THIS BOOK SCREWED ME.)"
3,Some of the joy may be the environment,"Having not been to the place where other folks have tried this, I'm guessing the market is a lot of the charm with this tea. Its ok, but its not the greatest tea I've ever had. It is spicy, and its sweet, but I prefer to control my own tea sweetness. I'm happy that others have found a tea they enjoy, but this one just isn't it for me. I will finish my box but not sure if I will get more."
4,Cinnamon Tea,"The teabags are convenient and I use them at work, but the loose tea is much better. Both the teabags amd the loose tea are great for anyone who loves cinnamon!"
5,market spice tea bags,"I'm very fond of Market Spice Tea and when I just want one cup, the tea bags are very convenient. I like to be able to do it in the microwave so obviously I can't use the loose tea and the metal strainer things. I put a tea bag in a cup of water and put it in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and it comes out just fine!"
5,Market Spice On-Line? GOD SEND!,"I am a Seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast.As an avid tea drinker I frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that Market Spice tea is the greatest tea blend EVER!!Now that I can buy Market Spice on Amazon, I can finally prove it!"
4,Love it!,"I needed a larger than average 3 ring binder, and this one works great. The outer material, in my opinion, could be a little nicer. It's just a plastic-y type material. That's not really a complaint, but for the price, it just would have been nice if the material was a little nicer. But it seems durable, and it works great for what I need to store, so I'd buy another one!"
5,MIRACLE JUICE!!!,"I've been drinking Genesis 100 Mangosteen for about a year now. A bit expensive but so worth it! It has helped me TREMENDOUSLY with my severe arthritis pain, allergies, ear infections, you name it. It is basically a natural anti-inflammatory and also keeps your immune system 'flushed'... as well as so many other benefits. I am a long, long time sufferer of the above illnesses... and discovering this product has been such a blessing! I will continue to drink this ""Miracle Juice"" for the rest of my life. Thank you, Lord, for this product and for aiding me with my healing! Miracles can happen! ;)"
5,Cuts down duration of colds,"I've been taking Mangosteen juice for about 3-4 months now and it definitely helps! A few months ago I came down with a bad cold that was going around that completely knocked me out-I couldn't even walk straight. I stayed in bed all day Friday and all night and by the next morning, I was up again. By Monday morning I was back in school working. Amazing-normally I get colds for about 2 weeks. But this one was gone in 3 days!I take about an ounce a day or every other day if I forget, and mix it with Juicy Juice or Cranberry Juice or whatever I have on hand. I recommend it and don't think it's too expensive because it lasts about a month-use it like a vitamin-a little every day as a supplement."
2,Fruit+ seeds+shell = Juice?,"it is like eating cellulose....., or watermelon with the green shell...Lucky me I bought a sample first and the the taste was disgusting, thought mangosteen fruit is one of the most delicious fruits. then I read on the label that there are in the bottle also seeds (which is about 70% of the inside) and the outside shell....Genesis Sea bukthorn juice is 5 star product, but this one is not."
4,Packaged well,"This was shipped to me wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged Very well ! It doesn't taste good, but doesn't taste Horrible either. I bought a bottle of Noni 100 from the same company, and got the same Great bubble wrap packing, but the taste of the Noni juice is horrible. I might have to just throw the bottle away, this Mangosteen tastes much better than that at least !"
2,The benefits DON'T out way the cost,"Used the mangosteen for approximately a month and didn't notice anybenefits greater than eating 1/2 a lemon twice a day, cost 0.30$ opposedto $1.16 per day for mangosteen.In my opinion the stuff is good for you but the benefits are mostly hype."
5,Now I know why these things are so expensive...,"There are certain conditions that nothing else can come close to sanding effectively. When sanding small parts or intricate details, I start with the outside edges and corners of the pad and trim those away when they become less effective, and nothing beats these things for sanding primer on automotive projects and lasting through the whole job. A quick blow off with an air hose and they go right back to work as though new."
3,Mixed bag,"This book is the culmination of research done by Mr. Gorsline. He has recreated the illustrations based upon research done primarily in the New York Library system. Many of his drawings have a reference... but that reference isn't formatted in such a way you could actually find out anything useful. For that reason it's not a particularly good choice for serious ""historical"" costumers. But if you're willing to accept that limitation, it is a nice reference, particularly the collected drawings of hair and head coverings."
1,Not Recommended,"For general interest or as an aid to artists, who merely need to know what a given article or style looked like this book is acceptable.But for researchers and writers, I would highly recommend Fashion in Costume 1200-2000, Revised by Joan Nunn. Not only excellent illustrations, but detailed information regarding what particulars were called, but their use and evolution."
1,Not even a tertiary source - redrawings of redrawings,I do not recommend this volume for anyone doing serious research on costume. I would recommend going with sources closer to the original.
2,Where's the rest of the world?,"This book focuses almost completely on European styles, with an exception for ancient Egypt. I was really hoping to use this for some 15th-century Incan / Mesoamerican reference, but this book doesn't even include anything close."
4,pretty good,"""Secrets of Discipline"" has some great philosophies about discipline. However, I take it with a grain of salt, as there's more than one way to skin a cat and every kid and situation is unique. That being said, I would reccomend this book as an addition to your parenting/ and or teaching bookshelf. It's an easy read and sometimes entertaining. Perhaps it's only fault is being a little ""up on my soap box""-ish."
5,A Grant Winner's Must Have,"Cheryl Carter New and James Aaron Quick have put together a complete collection of MUST HAVE books for the Grant Seeker. Getting the Grant funded is just part of the process, ""The Grant Winner's Toolkit"" walks you through the ""Now What?"" phase of grant seeking. I never put Cheryl and James's books back on the shelf, they are ALWAYS on my desk, where I can easily reach for them...they are the BEST!"
5,Real Age Makeover Book Review,Best guidance I seen on living a healthy lifestyle for normal people. I refer to it often. I highly recommend this book.
4,Very helpful information.,I enjoyed this DVD very much and watched already several times. There is so much useful information that is difficult to take it all in from the first time. I will be watching this again and again. I want to memorize all the information.I like it so much that I ordered a book by the same title. Dr Roisen is great.
3,Info-mercial in print,"I am not trying to take anything away from the underlying message in this book. Because, it is valuable. BUT, it is a painful read. It is just like an info-mercial... The 1st 100 pages keeps repeating that you are going to learn a better way to live but doesn't tell you how. The book could have been a third of the length and gotten the message across very well. Michael needs to find a new editor for his next book."
3,"Too much ""Fill""","The content is good but way too much ""Fill"". The meat of the book could be published in less than 1/3 of the pages of the book."
3,Dvorak Piano Quintets,"Wonderful music, wonderful quartet - especially Richter, the amazing pianist, but poor quality reproduction on this older recording. Too bad."
3,Bob in Santa Monica,"This is supposedly a classic performance. I recommend, however, that you avoid it. First of all, it is a live performance, which is not indicated in the Amazon listing, and which is in very small print on the back of the CD. Although the audience is mostly well behaved, the sound editor could easily have removed the usual coughing between movements, and the mood-jarring applause at the ends. Minus one star here. Second, the performances suffer (in my opinion) from frequent aggressive, driven tempos which suck the beauty out of the music. While the effect is virtuosic and the contrasts can be dramatic, the performers seem more interested in making a statement than in making beautiful music. Minus a second star. A disappointment, overall."
3,"Good, but not great","Jack Gilbert has penned many fine poems, but his range is limited, and he is a bit more showy and tenacious than deep. I too come away feeling like I am hearing the same poem over and over. Ezra Pound he ain't. I can understand why many might like his work, but really now, a ""national treasure""?There are stronger poets, more fierce, more profound, and brighter by far."
5,Excellent Romantic Novel!!,I thought this was an excellent book. It was very well-written. I read it in one day!!
5,"Superb collection, a great place to start",This is a superb and mostly down-tempo collection of some wonderful compositions played beautifully.I have listened this CD almost 100 times in the last decade and have yet to tire of it. But who's counting?
1,He frickin' hums on every cut,"Ok, not the most sophisticated review but.... I can't get past the humming. Plus he isn't a very good hummer. Oscar Peterson - now there is a good hummer. I am listening to Genn's CD as I write this and the guy is still humming away - didn't he know they were recording? Maybe I am missing something here - is humming along with Brahms really OK? No more Glenn for me. I like my classical piano hum free."
1,Nice Notebook Terrible service from HP,"I would have given it a zero if I could. Do not bother buying an HP their service is terrible. My hinge broke on my notebook. I called HP to purchase the part and they told me they cannot sell one to me. However, they do have the part to fix it if i pay them $300. What a joke. I would put any HP at the very bottom of you list."
3,Photo incorrect,"The photo shows a 1.8 inch tape. The actual product is 1 inch width. Other than that, its just scotch tape."
3,household use,does not have medium high adhesion as said in listing-i would say just medium level adhesion.good for household use - may not suit for covering polished surface
2,On the Boring Side,"I just finished Hot August Nights and wasn't that thrilled. I did think the writing and characters were good. They had depth and were likable. However, the situation and their romance in particular lacked spark or something. I found it to be on the boring side."
1,Snooze,If you should happen to get passed the Housekeeper's Daughter and hoping things pick up in Hot August Nights (like I did) your sadly mistaken.There's nothing really hot about the story. The beautiful rich and catered woman ends up working building a house with her brother's best friend whom she had an affair with. You would think there would be some excitement. Except there's none. Not even the hurricane heading for the construction site pulls enough excitment.Like Housekeeper's Daughter both charactors are really likeable and the storyline is really good but instead it just dry as a dust.
5,OEM at a great price,I bought this Blower Motor Resistor thru Amazon for less than 1/2 the price of the local auto parts stores. It was original equipment so I wasn't worried about the quality or fit. It was quite easy to install and saved me a ton of money as compared to having it done professionally.
4,Billie,This was the best Bio I have read on Billie. Previous Bios never were clear on how many times she was married. Actually she was only married twice. There was also quite a bit of detail on her growing up in Baltimore. I always thought that Billie was from the Pennsylvania Ave. section of West Baltimore. But she actually grew up near Fells Point. LATER she moved near to the Royale Theatre in West Baltimore. Also there is clarification of the relationship between her Mother and Father.HOWEVER there was too much description of her later drug use. (If you have read one Junkies life (as in John Belushi) you don't need to read about the drug use in another Junkie.) BUT there was also clarification that her addiction didn't start because of a white Band Member (which was shown in the movie).Of the 4 books that I have read on Billie this was the best.
5,Entertaining and Educational!,"""Wishing on the Moon"" by Donald Clarke, is an incredibly remarkable book. I was totally in awe how a man can capture every little detail of Billie Holiday's life, as well as those who were around her...those that new her the best and AT her best. He tells the truth in all of it's entirety. The information gathered to produce this book is very well written, for it gives the reader a set time that a certain event has taken place. He(the author) goes into a summary of each period to give the reader background information about people that played a part in her life. This form of writing helps the reader not only learn of the life and times of this great performer, but also helps the reader imagine what is going in her (Billie Holiday's) lifetime as you read. It's like a great movie fit into a little book!"
2,The Blues,"I approached this book hoping that it would educate me and be an interesting read. I have already seen the movie about her life and read Lady Sings The Blues, so I was hoping for a more in depth look at the lady. To be truthful, this book is not up to that challenge and throws little new light upon her life."
3,No Grill,"I read the review from another buyer and noticed there was no grill. Given the name of the Microwave containing ""grill"" I however ignored it and bought it anyway as I wanted a grill. There IS NO grill!I believe this is a mistake from Amazon as it says nothing about grill on the package it arrived in. Since it is almost impossible to change things via Amazon I have kept it and it works fine."
3,Whiny,"This is a whiny book. The author rails against whites who moved to the suburbs or placed their children in private schools and against blacks who did the same. She seems to long for some sort of state run utopia where we are all forced to live side by side and forced to smile and like it or else.No thanks.In the wake of the aniversary of Brown v. Board of Education several silly books like this were published. All, and this one especially failed to grasp what Brown was about. It wasn't that black people need to be near whites or that we can't live without them in our neighborhoods or schools. Brown was about the chance to go out and meet opportunity. We are free to go to school where we want. The national guard doesn't have to be activated in order to get black chidren into a shchool anymore. We are free to live where we want. We are free to socialize with whomever we want. I'd hardly call that integration's failure. The book and the author don't make their cases."
2,Great Performance Horrendously Overly Remastered,"The small bit of the performance that I heard was lively, full-throated in its excitement. What a let-down, then, that the remastered sound was so artificial. The instrumentalists sounded as though they had been vacuum-wrapped in plastic. There was no audio hiss but also no air space or what should have been the natural sounds of the instruments, especially the brass."
1,definitly not step-by-step!,"I bought this book because although I'm very proficient with film, I'm new to digital and wanted to learn some of the basics of photoshop as it relates to portraiture. I was extremely disappointed. I tried one of the projects that had 5 steps and it ended up taking me two hours to complete. In the end, I had to guess because several key steps were not even mentioned. Computers are my thing. Photography is my thing. This book does not address both in a way that integrates the two well."
3,Lite Light,It works and has a non-laser output. I bought a package of the same lights[3] for $9.00. So I would not say it was cheap by any stretch of the...
1,A waste of money,"I originally reviewed this item when it was new and gave it a couple stars. Now I see that was generous. The lasar light never worked. The led lights quickly faded until the 1-led backup that I carry on my walks was brighter than this one. I replaced the batteries to no avail. I tweaked the contacts and it got a little better. Then I walked with a friend who has a flashlight from a different manufacturer, fewer led's, that works properly. Compared to that one, this one is no better than a Christmas tree bulb. Don't waste your money."
1,Product arrived nonfuncional.,I have no idea how this product works. It arrived at my house nonfunctional. A little quality control would be nice.
1,Flashlight is awful,"When I received this flashlight, the battery cap would not screw on and the case is very cheap. Would recommend buying one of the other hundred flashlights on amazon."
4,Great!,This Laser Pointer Flashlight is a very great product and I recommend that you buy it. It has a good price and it comes with a case. The flashlight and laser are strong and it only requires 3 aaa batteries.
2,Never got item,I never got this item. They told me that they had sold out of them and asked if I would change my order to another light. No thank you.
1,Avoid at all costs!,"1. After you click on the flashlight, you click again for the laser, then again to turn it off. it should have separate buttons for the two.2. beam is way too wide like a shotgun spread. not useful at all at any distance.3. Should be much brighter for 8 LED's. I have a 1 led light that's just as bright!4. Some of the LED's started crapping out on me after only a weeks usage!5. Lanyard is not even large enough for an average 7 year old kid to get their hand through!This one looks good, feels heavy duty but in reality - it's an el-cheapo light. Avoid! Sent back for refund!"
5,Classic Kinsgmen Quartet at their Best!,"This is one of the Kingsmen Quartet's best projects yet. It's hard to pick a favorite on this project because i like them all. Beautiful four part harmony being done on old songs that we used to hear. Bryan Hutson on lead, Parker Johnathon on baritone, veteran bass singer Ray Dean Reese, and tenor, newcomer Jerry Martin. Also, there is a video of this project that is fantastic, if you like behind the scenes footage of in the studio as they record this album! This project is a must for all Kingsmen fans and/or Southern gospel music fans!"
1,misleading title,"This book is a superficial discussion of evolution on earth, not artificial life. The actual content on artificial life and agents would make a mediocre and short magazine article. This book brings out the shortcommings of buying a book online because less than five minutes in a bookstore aisle would reveal the uselessness of this book."
5,YES! FINALLY!,"I just moved away from Detroit to North Carolina, and the one thing I will miss the most is the music; the accessibility of the stores, the artists, and the venues. Musically, it is a truly fine city with plenty of history and character.This album was supposed to be a out a long time ago (a LONG time ago). It is really a treat for the fans who have gone to the shows to hear these great songs because now they can have them to play at home. This is especially true for me, since I no longer have the ability to see shows in Detroit :*-(For those who have yet to hear of the Fags, you're also in for a treat. Their sound reminds me the most of Cheap Trick; they write very well crafted songs, but also maintain enough of a rough edge that really keeps this from falling into the category of soulless corporate crap rock.My favorite song has become 'Rockstar', but again, they write good songs, so enjoy every moment of it."
4,The Fags - 'Light 'Em Up' (Idol Records),"Saw this trio open for X awhile back during their 'Make The Music Go Bang' tour. Basically, just good toe-tapping power pop with plenty of drive. Tracks that make this CD worth a listen are ""Tonight"", the Cheap Trick-like ""Siren Song"", ""Here's Looking At You"", the radio friendly ""Back Of The Line"" and the title cut ""Light 'Em Up"". Line-up: John Liccardello - guitar & vocals, Tim Patalan - bass & vocals and JImmy Paluzzi - drums & vocals. Recommended for fans of the Replacements, Cheap Trick, Mooney Suzuki and The Go."
2,Works for a month or so,Worked fine for the first month and a half then developed holes that sprayed large areas and reduced the pressure in the rest of the hose so they no longer sprayed an even pattern.
1,TOTAL *** WASTE OF MONEY ***,I bought two of these from Amazon. Initially they worked fine but within several weeks a sprinkler hole near the end of the hose enlarged to the point the rest of the hose lose pressure. DO NOT BUY THIS HOSE UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY!!!
1,Only Sprinkles in One Direction,You buy a flat sprinkler hose to layout a uniform flow of water to both sides of the hose. Not this one. All the holes face one direction. Big holes at both ends and small holes in the middle. I'm glad I did not throw out my old hose. I'm going to fix it. Better than this new garbage.
1,Sorry soaker sprinkler hose,"If you can't set a timer and expect a hose to work, then you are not buying a hose, but a piece of junk. The first day at the hose ends a tear started inside as the support ridges tore from the top and bottom, causing the ends to balloon up like a weenie balloon. This got worse with each use until it got about 8 inches from the brass ends. The holes enlarged so big that water jetted out there and little elsewhere. I have owned 3 flat sprinkler soaker hoses in my life. Each one was the harder green material and not clear like this. Each lasted about 10 years. I think the plastic is too soft, and the clear only compounds the problem as water gets hot inside making the plastic even more soft. I would not recommend buying this unless you wanted to hang yourself, because that would be a soft touch."
1,I got hosed,"I first purchased 3 of these soaker hoses a couple of years ago with great success. However, in the last year I have purchased 2 more and they have sprung leaks at the beginning and end, just as others have reported. Waste of money."
1,GILMOUR SOAKER HOSE,"THE GILMOUR SOAKER HOSE IS A LOOSER. I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM AND WITHIN THE FIRST TEN DAYS, THE FIRST ONE FAILED IN THE SAME FASHION AS DESCRIBED IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS.IT DEVELOPED LARGE HOLES AT EITHER END RESULTING IN HUGE QUANTITIES OF WATER THAT WASHED AWAY THE SOIL. I HOOKED UP THE SECOND ONE WITH THE SAME RESULT IN TWO WEEKS. IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT MY WATER PRESSURE IS A TIMID 40 LBS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS KIND OF FAILURE. THE LIFETIME GUARANTEE IS EQUALLY AS BAD. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO CUT OFF THE ENDS OF THE HOSE AND SEND IT TO THEM AND THEY WILL SEND YOU A NEW ONE. IT WILL COST ME NEARLY THE VALUE OF THE HOSE TO SEND THE ENDS BACK TO THEM AND AND THEN ALL I HAVE IS ANOTHER HOSE THAT WILL FAIL.SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND AGGRAVATION AND TAKE A PASS ON THESE HOSES."
1,Soaker hoses are very flimsy,"These hoses are very flimsy. Very cheaply made.The ""lifetime warranty"" is only good if you jump through a bunch of hoops that are not stated on the packaging.The company address on the packaging is not their current address.I am very disappointed with these hoses."
1,lousy product,"I've owned three of these sprinkler hoses. The last one lasted a month. I orderer a Flexon sprinkler hose and it cost a couple of dollars more, but seems to be much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,Poor quality even with care.,This product is of such poor quality that even following the procedures of slowly turning on the water the products holes began to enlarge and the hoses would no longer work. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Waste of money!,"Looks like everyone says the same thing... After just one use of this hose, it developed a huge hole on the back side (not the side with the holes)... So now it cannot be used at all because the force of the water coming out this huge hole will dig a huge hole in my flower bed... I DO NOT recommend this product!"
1,low quality,"Purchased 2 of these hoses, both have sprung leaks after a couple of uses. Really low quality plastic. Don't waste your money on these."
2,Doesn't hold up to regular use,We used this to sprinkle on particular area only. We would move it only for weekly mowing. It lasted but a month or so before it sprung a significant leak making it unusable. We had bought two and the second faired no better.
1,Very Disappointed!,"I actually LOVE Soft Musk by Avon.What I hated was the fact that when I received the two bottles, the boxes were dog-eared and the perfume was so old it had no smell whatsoever! I take that back it smelled like alcohol. I know this because, I had an Avon lady who gave me some that she had for quite some time...and the conition of the cologne was exactly the same. I was very disappointed."
4,Just like I remembered!,"I was so pleased to recieve my order promptly and in good condition. I ordered it for myself, but it was my Mother's perfume and has sentimental value to me. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to have this beautiful fragrance again. Thank you."
2,Terrible quality,"I bought this product because it had been very highly rated. However, I quickly realized that with windows xp the installation would not be simple. After going through a long process to get this thing installed, I was given the worst quality video I have ever seen in my life. The quality is so poor that it is unwatchable, even from a distance. The only reason that I even give this product two stars is because the TV Listings function is very nice and makes recording simple. Unfortunately I have never wanted to record anything because who wants to record something that they can't even watch?"
2,"I'm with ""Sheer Boredom""","I'm with the reviewer who posted ""Sheer Boredom"". I greatly enjoyed the Lytton family trilogy, but this one is a real disappointment. In part, it may be the lack of historical trappings, along with the singularly uninteresting contemporary British political backdrop (and the author's pet peeves about socialized medicine), but I think the far more serious problem is the lack of character development. It's simply hard to care what happens to these cardboard cut out characters.I haven't given up totally on the author, but will be cautious going foward."
2,Too much detail...,This book reads like a boring conversation. Way too much detail before the author gets to the point. I figured the interesting pieces out early and was left with mundane dialog of characters trying to figure it out. I was sort of glad when one of the characters died so I wouldn't have to listen to that characters piece of the story. I read the whole book because I was hoping for an interesting twist that didn't happen.
2,Long and Dull,"I listened to this book on CD and it was incredibly long at 22 CDs and not terribly much happened. I would have thought there would have been more character development in this book. It really is true that the reader must find something likable about the characters to care what happens to them. The fact that the author practically broadcast who the baby's parents were so early in the story made it not nearly as fun. By the time the ""revelation"" came about I think I knew for at least one hundred pages if not more earlier. This one had the potential to be really great, but this is one I would pass on. I can't get back all of those hours of listening."
3,wasn't this a TV mini-series in the 80's?,"Back in the 80's, there was a TV mini-series with a one-word title involving some high school girls, a hidden pregnancy, a child placed into foster care. All the girls became highly successful executives. The girl baby up to be a soft porn star and went searching for her mother.Same plot, same characters, different decade/scenery."
2,sheer meaning transparent?,"I have enjoyed other novels by this author, and normally enjoy the fact that my intelligence is not insulted with the usual ""chic lit"" blather. Unfortunately, this book has tainted my opinion a bit.First of all, I knew by the end of chapter one who Kate's mother was. I knew by the end of chapter 2 that I couldn't care less what happened to any of these insecure, neurotic, annoying women. I knew by the end of chapter 3 that this book could have, and should have, been about 200 pages instead of 600+.I can't believe I ""ate"" the whole thing. There's 4 hours of my life that I can't get back."
3,Pleasurable writing but the plot drags like a soap opera,"This was my first Penny Vincenzi novel. After reading numerous reviews of many of her books, I chose to begin with this one in Kindle. I was ready for a great read. I ended up with a contradiction. I did enjoy much of Ms. Vincenzi's writing style - she isn't flowery & full of superlative adjectives, thank god - but I got fed up with the immaturity of her characters. Rather than keeping my interest piqued I lost confidence in her ability to wrap up the story or leave me with admiration for any of her characters. Maybe if I was 30 years old & reading her book I would have enjoyed it more. But I am close to 60 & I found myself saying, lord are these women going to grow up? Maybe I will try another of her books, but not for a long while."
3,Very good but not great,This book is very good but not great. The Lytton family trilogy is her best work. Read all 3 of those before this one.
3,Not up to par,"Last summer I discovered this author and fell in love with her family trilogy that began with No Angel. I was disappointed when the last one ended. I had invested 2500 pages in the family and it was hard to say goodbye. After a Vincenzi break, I was eager to fall into another one of her stories. Sheer Abandon was quite a disappointment! The story was okay, but very predictable and not up to par with theother books by this author. With that said, it is still better than some. Maybe it would not have been so disappointing if I had not read the trilogy first."
4,little too much,"as prolific a writer as louis l'amour was, there are all kinds of great quotes, but with as many books and stories as the man has, they can be tough to look up. so it's great that his daughter compiled this collection. i had to only give it four stars for 2 reasons: 1-you'll find no quotes from his single poetry collection or from interviews; 2-when you write as much as l'amour did, you are going to end up repeating yourself. that's understandable, but when editing a collection of quotes, you can leave out quotes that simply say the same thing in just about the same words."
4,Nearly a 5-star,"The only thing that prevents this book from being a 5-star book is the limited number of works the quotes were taken from. Many wonderful bits of wisdom were missed in quoting mostly from the Sackett series and some of the ""major"" novels. This book would be good for everyone whether they read L'Amour or not."
3,Some classic cuts.,"All these ""old school"" compilations always have a handfull of great tracks, and then a good chunk of filler. This is no different. You can decide what the filler is, but there are 5 great cuts. Other than the obvious classic ""Rapper's Delight"", there's also ""The Message"", ""That's the Joint"", ""White Lines"", and the excellent ""New York, New York"". Now if somebody could ever get these hits on a single CD with Whodini, Newcleus, and The Fat Boys, we'd have a 5 star collection. This is good enough to get out the cardboard though."
4,"an album that is one of a kind, excellent","brilliant one of the best albums, up there with de la soul, THREE FEET HIGH AND RISING and kurtis blow THE BEST OF RAPPIN' well worth buying if you have the spare dollars! You may also want to take a look at a trach by the fresh prince - GIRLS AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE"

1,Pretentious Hipster Nonsense,"This is purported to be a children's book? It reads like someone who desperately wants to make sure everyone knows how hip they are to the ways of Hollywood and celebrity. The story is beyond the grasp of children and yet way too juvenile for adults. Even the design and illustration are a perfect example of how to make a mess with too many changing fonts and too many precious doodles.I noticed that Ms. Kalman recently did the illustrations for the new Elements of Style and with some restraint, her talent is much better displayed in those pages."
2,Way of Bootleg,This one sounds like it was recorded with a hand-held mic. Back in the day we called this a bootleg. I can't believe GG would have authorized this release.And yet the musicianship transcends all...giving it two stars for the transcending.
1,Sounds Like ....CRAP !!!!!,I'm A Big Gentle Giant Fan....And Have All Of There Stuff....This One Is The WORST!..PLEASE..Don't Waste Your Money.....Sounds Like It Was Recorded While Takin' A Crap.
1,iPAQ H5550,"It's cheap. But, it doesn't fit good. It's protruded, and I have to use tape to hold it down.However, holds the charge good."
4,I should have listened to Gamespot TV before I bought!,"Last year when I was Xmas Shopping, I bought MechWarrior 3, One of the Featured Best Mech games along with Heavy Gear 2. GSTV reccomended HG2. I wasn't at all impressed with Mw3 - Non oringinal story line, hard to control mechs, and a wee to hard. HG2, however, is and older game I just bought in the Jewel Case, Being 2 years old, I thought it had BETTER Graphics, MORE 'Gears', MORE, COOLER weapions, and a top notch story line. I should stop being stubborn!"
3,Mechwarrior light,"This is one of the robot combat games that has been released over the years. Mechwarrior is another example of these games, and is in my opinion the best of them (Mechwarrior 3!). But this one isn't that bad either.It's set in a much similar setting and is also based on a boardgame (as Mechwarrior). The biggest differense is the scale of the robots, in Mechwarrior they are the size of buildings, while here they are just a bit bigger than a man.What i think this game lack is the control you have over building/configuring the mechs (compared to Mechwarriors endless possibilities).But overall the game is fun to play, ok to look at and have an ok storyline.But if i had the choice between Heavy Gear and Mechwarrior, I would have taken Mechwarrior any day!"
2,The Hard facts,"The facts are MEch 4 was jsut released a couple days ago, and jsut by playing the first couple mission i can tell that it blows heavy gear and HG2 out of the water, i am a big fan of battlemech and gear type games, owning mw1-4 and HG 1 and have played hg2, the mechwarrior series is much more realisitic and has a much better storyline, in mw4 the 'mech is responsive to being hit by a ppc (particle projection cannon) blast not jsut standing there like oh no u hit me with with a ppc, and HG 1 gives way to much freedom with the gear lab, so u can have your own personal configs, not the madcat or atlas that has been feared, if u r looking into this game look into the mechwarrior series first, exspecially Mechwarrior 4:vengeance"
1,Caused greasy acne....,"Stuff is too strong. I only took a few drops and broke out into the most horrible black head, greasy acne ever. Acne cleared once I stopped taking. A coworker even noticed the acne and commented on it. The problem with this stuff is that you don't quite know the correct dosage to take because too much iodine is just as bad for the thyroid as not enough. I read the directions but still did not like the outcome. Maybe Iodoral works better, but not sure yet."
5,Wouldn't be without it!,"I have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years. I live in California where we get many little earthquakes, and I have grandchildren who occasionally slam doors, so anything hanging on the walls could shift. I can't stand having mirrors, pictures, clocks, etc. hanging crooked. I hang the object with a picture-hangar which holds the weight, but always put mounting tape at two corners which holds the frame straight on the wall. This mounting tape is permanent - so place it where you want it to stay. I would never put it on the back of a clock, for instance, if the battery will need changing once a year. I have found it takes patience to remove it from any surface. This product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that cannot tolerate a nail or screw hole. Scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal."
4,Useful stuff to have around,"I remember learning, back in 1st or 2nd grade, how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk, hand a couple of light pictures, and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light, inexpensive, durable and is handy to have around."
1,No stick!,Beware. Doesn't stick to porous surface - which is 99.9% of all outdoor landscaping materials. Tried to adhere a small landscaping stone to another which had come loose. This product did not do the job - it would not stick to the stones.
5,"A very good product, just be careful where you use this tape","Scotch is the brand I usually buy when looking for tapes. I have bought the two sided tapes for years now, for both business and personal needs. The early lesson I learned was to make doubly sure that you mount to a surface where you won't want to remove the item from later. If you mount a picture to a painted wall, for example, and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape. This tape here is clearly called ""Permanent"" for good reason."
5,Works on many surfaces,"I have used this on tile, metal, glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience. I did notice that if the surface is ice cold, make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick. To remove, I slid a razor through the foam core and used Goo Gone to remove the rest of the square, worked great! I was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than I had been meaning to mount for months, this stuff gets the job done!"
4,Great for mounting Photos,"So far I've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass. It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs. It does depend what you mount to, someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls, if the surface you use is weak the tape isn't going to change this fact. I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface, this tape is strong enough for jobs like this. This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape, the roll is 1/2"" wide X 75"" long, other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size."
2,Didn't hold very well,"I used this to hold up a light mirror. At first I thought the mirror was too heavy, so I used tape all around the edges and the inside part of back of the frame. Yet after a few weeks, it fell from the wall. The mirror is 8x11 and made with very light wood material, yet it still couldn't hold it up. :("
4,"""Magic""","Putting objects, other than pictures, on the wall can be daunting. The permanent mounting tape is easy to use and seems to work well so far. Pealing the tape is easy and mounting it is also simple. I also have used it for creating art projects where I want certain items to stick on without the use of messy glue.Of course nails and screws work well for hanging things, but I don't always want to put more holes in the walls of my house. Holes can be hard to fill and hide even when you paint over the surface. So the tape is simple and can be used on most wall surfaces including tile and wood. It's difficult to put nails into tile, so this product takes care of that.It's also handy since it's a simple roll of tape. I don't need other equipment and there is no cleaning up. So for that unusual project, I think it's great to have on hand. The only question is whether it will be easy to remove and clean up if I want to take if off the wall or off the other items."
5,Strong and Sticky Mounting Tape,"This is useful and highly adhesive mounting tape that can be used for a number of applications. I found it useful for mounting posters, but it has a number of other applications as well. It offers a good amount for the price."
4,Scotch mounting tap,"Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. One helpful hint, be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks, so that it doesn't lifts off easily. Also, we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape. The paint and texture don't come off so easily when you take the tape off later--which is great. We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip. We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape."
3,The Story of Professional Gospel Quartet Singing,"This book is about white gospel singing groups. The roots for Professional Gospel Quartet Singing is with Black Gospel Quartets/Groups. The book has errors but in general is good information. Mr. Terrell needs to define the term ""Southern Gospel Music."" I gave it a 3 star because it lacked details and dates. Other than a few words about CANAAN there is absolutely no mention of artists and recording companies in other parts of the Midwest and on the Westcoast and their contribution.Thank youJim"
2,could have been worse....,"This movie was just ok.not the best and deffinatly not jeffery combs at his best but ive seen worse.the was a few good and creative killings and some gore but not much,lots of blood though.the plot was really paper thin but passible.as a whole the movie couldve been better.worth a rent but i only paid $0.15 for it so i cant complain.dont buy for anymore then $5.like i said not the best but you could be watching alot worse like turistas(horrible).the sound on this dvd is a mixed bag where the talking is kinda low but the music and sfx are loud,although this leads to a few cheap scares that will force some people to jump because of the loud ness of the sfx.watch at your own risk."
1,Brutal...you can say that again,I fell asleep before my dog got the chance. This one is really brutal...no pun intended...no acting...no script...no way! The best of this film was my fast forward and stop buttons.
1,Worse than a B rated slasher,I thought Turista was bad - how wrong I was b/c Brutal is even worse. The movie is slow and I've forgotten what a bad B movie is like. Don't bother with the movie and don't consider it a rental.
2,Brutal Indeed,"Pretty much mindless repeats of the old standards.. only one woman with an iq above 30, archtypical men, lame responses to danger, lackadaisical performances.... for it's type it's ok .. only the thinest plot to glue a series of grusome events (poorly depicted and poorly shot for slash films) together and flash a bit of T&A along the way.... you could pass 90 minutes on this but you probably have something better to do. As a movie I'd rank it a 1 star, but as a slash film its probably a 3 so I average it out to a weak 2."
1,Poor Carburetor,"I will agree with many others on this site. The unit is hard to start and will not run after a short operating time. The reason is the carburetor. The thing is poorly designed and Troy-Bilt and Briggs & Stratton will not stand behind this product.The unit comes with a two year warranty which is one reason I bought it. But when it does not start or run and you take it in they will tell you it is a carburetor problem and that it is your fault for using bad / dirty gas. They will not honor the warranty. The same gas that runs your mower, weed whacker, chain saw, pressure washer and generator just fine. They also fail to mention that the gas cap is indeed vented. The usual repair charge is $60 but after only getting 6 difficult starting uses in less than 6 months I returned it for a refund.I have never received such rude customer service as I did from Troy-Bilt. Something tells me they are used to hearing about the poor performance of this unit.Caveat EmptorI am looking at a McClane now."
1,Junk,Worked 1st 2 times very well now I have to push the primer bulb for 5-10 min for it to warm up. Then I can edge with it and stop pushing the primer bulb. I have never used old gas in this unit and have only used it 5 times sine I bought it last year.UPDATE:I added a manual throttle control to replace the auto throttle on the carburetor now it starts 1st pull every time. I spent around $5 for it with the cable.
1,Piece of Junk!!,"I still Purchased after reading all the bad reviews and it was one big mistake. The unit was packaged so badly it almost fell out of the box when I picked it up. Luckily is was only shipped from 50 miles away so there was little handling involved and little time for shipping damage to occur. After assembling, adding oil and gas I went to pull the rope to start the engine and it would not budge an inch. I cannot believe it was allowed to come out of the factory like that. Of course it cannot be returned and actually isn't worth it to fix so Amazon customer service told me to donate to someone and they would ship out a replacement. Hoping for better luck this time around.Just got the replacement today and this unit has the same problem.Update:Both were damaged in transit. Both recoils were smashed. I was given a complete refund."
1,Impossible to start,"As has been noted by other reviewers, this edger is very hard to start. Priming 10-15 times helps but not always. After a year of frustration, I gave it away."
1,drive belt short life span,"I purchased a troy-bilt lawn edger model 554 1 month ago and have used it 3 times. The drive belt broke during the 3rd time I had used it. Uncertain as to why. I had not been ""over-taxing"" the system by edging through thick grass, etc. Needless to say I am very disappointed. Does anyone else who has had this problem have a suggestion as to how to avoid it from happening again? Is there an ""industrial strength "" belt available?"
1,Inoperable edger shipped to me,"With no damage to the carton, my edger had either a frozen engine or binding accessory. I removed the spark plug and with great effort the engine can kind of turn over. I am instructed to take it to a Troy service center 30 miles from my residence. More later on that. The pull cord is out and will not retract. Even the most basic inspection at the factory should have uncovered this problem. Now Amazon says they are done with this deal and I am stuck with an inoperable and unstartable edger for which I paid $296. We'll see what the ""authorized service center"" comes up with but I'm reasonably confident that all the inconvenience will be borne by me the consumer and no help from Amazon.com. John Marshall, Bluewater Bay Florida"
1,You get what you pay for,"I received a cheap copy of a poster that was poorly printed and it ended up in the dump. In all fairness, I didn't pay much for it and I definitely got my moneys worth. Next time I order this print, I won't be so cheap and hopefully will get something of better quality."
4,Clever and great for the classroom,"I have a growing collection of works that are variations of classic folk and fairytales. This is one of the cleverest reworkings of the 3 Little Pigs I've seen. In the literacy program I am working on in Chicago Public Schools, we are using this book in several intermediate grade classrooms as an engaging way to teaching a point of grammar (comparative and superlative forms) and as one of a series of 3 Little Pig stories we are comparing--the end goal is to turn the kids into authors of their own ""fractured fairy tale."""
3,Here comes Bozo the Clown.,"Here we have a children's album by Larry ""Bozo"" Harmon. Do children even know who Bozo is nowadays? Anyway, this is a pretty fun album for kids and kids at heart."
4,Fun for the price,My 3 year old daughter loved this zoo playset! You can mix and match with other playsets and the magnets are good enough to use for play on the refridgerator. The only issue is that the magnets get damaged and some of the smaller pieces get lost easily.
4,good travel book,"My two-year old son loves this book. It has served us very well. When he was a bit younger, he just liked sticking the magnets on the board and taking them off. Then, he started asking about the names followed by matching the magnets to the book that is included. ""Look Mommy, this is a polar bear,"" and would point to the same thing in the book, and I could read the description. We took it on a trans-Pacific flight and it took up some time. (The handle broke off quickly.)"
4,a pleasant change in game cube games,"I bought this for my grandson, age 6-1/2 for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. More than any other games he has. Says that it is fun and lets him do things. They get to use police cars, fire engines, cranes, dump trucks to unlock different areas to go to. He keeps replaying it and never gets tired of it. A wonderful game for this age group."
3,Great for youngsters,"Bought this for my 5 year old son and he just loves it. He loves that he can do so many different things with the different vehicles available and I love that he can play this game alone, without help from me, boosting his confidence along the way. So many of the games out there are too difficult or just plain inappropriate for young children. This is a wonderful game for beginners."
4,Great game for a beginner,"Bought this game used for my 5 y.o. who is new to gaming systems. We play it on the wii with the gamecube accessories. I love that it is self-directed and not high on the frustration factor. Its one of the few games that I don't have to sit next to him and give him constant direction along the way. Gave it 4 stars because it is repetitive and Tonka Joe is annoying... however for a child who doesn't always listen the first time the repeated direction is quite helpful. It also helps teach the joystick movement and gets them used to using the button controls. I plan to save this game for my younger children to grow into. If you can find it used at a gaming store, its worth the $4-$5 you pay for it."
4,Good book for anyone interested in rock or FM radio,I enjoyed this book about the history of FM rock radio. I live in the New York metro area and grew up listening to WNEW (Richard Neer's station) and WPLJ (the biggest competitor). So many of the characters (mostly the DJs) were familiar to me. Richard Neer does a good job of intertwining his story with the larger story of the FM radio and rock music industries. He does tell us about many of the people of the industry and sometimes it is a little much to keep track of all. All-in-all recommended for anyone with any interest in rock music or the NYC radio scene.
3,Autobiography of a radio survivor,"A memoir of a bygone era, FM tells the story of the successful career of it's author, Richard Neer, a one-time champion of free form rock radio. Focusing predominately on his rock and roll heyday, Neer concentrates on what he lived first hand, the rise and fall of New York's premier rock station; WNEW FM.Reading much like an interesting biography, FM's flaw seems to be its limited regional appeal. Luckily for the reader, Neer's nice-guy personality outshines any minor foibles. For a fan of WNEW in the 70's & 80's, FM is joy to read.Like its obvious predecessor, ROCKING AMERICA by Rick Sklar, FM's target audience would seem to be New York area radio listeners and professional radio broadcasters. If you are either, open it up and see what falls out of Neer's closet. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Noble Topic, Wrong Author","It's amazing that a book mourning the loss of FM Rock Radio comes from someone who did little or nothing to save it during its decline. Richard Neer for years seemed happy playing a narrower and narrower playlist at his NYC station. Unlike some jocks that stood up for the format by leaving for other stations where they could remain true to the early rock radio ideals, Neer just kept collecting paychecks at WNEW-FM as they became more and more what he is now writing against. And now, Neer is a talk announcer at an all-sports station, making his credibility even less for this topic. My point is this topic would be better served by someone who actually took some career chances to defend the FM format that is praised here."
2,"It's been written, but...","The book is ""Radio Waves: Life and revolution on the Fm dial"" by Jim Ladd. Change a few call letters and it's a very similar book. If you lived in NYC and listened to fm radio there in the 1970s and enjoyed it, then this book is for you. If you really are a radio nut, then this book may be for you. It's a good read. However, if you've read Ladd's book, save your money and more importantly, your time. Life and time are short and there are a lot of other stories (books) to read."
5,Best support to seeing live,I saw These guys live in MPLs last year and it was wonderful!!! The energy of the music is really conveyed on this CD. More club sounding than his other stuff. His other CDS are good but I like this one the best!! He is able to make his music poppy yet bring the bring the club beat!! makes you just wanna get up and dance!
2,Stay away from this one !!,"I am a synthpop fan but this album just doesn't work for me personally. It's very inconsistent, especially the vocal. I am not saying the whole album is worthless, there are some good songs too such as ""Spellbound"" & ""The White Room."" But that's it!! One may experiment with the music, but they definitely need more consistency in creating a sound album. A couple of okay songs don't do any justice at all. Maybe what they need is a great producer to work with..... so they can bring themselves up to the next level. At this state, it's simply POOR. TOO BAD. Peace!!"
4,Great computer game thriller,"This is probably one of the better books I have read recently that tries to capture the addiction that is possible with computer games. It does so well without coming off with too much of the typical stereo types. The story moves along quickly and the characters are written so as to be very believable.I would recommend this Christian book to anyone who is looking for a good novel to read, or anyone who wants to point out to some of the gaming generation out there, about the dangers of video game addictions."
5,Should be a School Textbook--but probably won't!,"This is a wonderful, to-the-point saga of the years that changed history! It should be a textbook--and the only reason it WON'T be is that it crosses too many agendas!BTW--why is this book out of print?"
1,Continuing The Myth,"I cannot recommend this book. The author totally ignores the facts. He practically ignores the effects of 44 years of anti-Communist American foreign policy, and fails to discuss virtually any policies or actions, not connected to the Reagan administration. Of course, if you already buy into the myth, this book is for you."
5,Powerful performance of Handel's Best,This is an excellent performance of Handel's finest oratorio. The most casual listener will be overwhelmed by the sheer power of this masterpiece. The choruses are truly the most magnificent and awe inspiring that Handel has to offer. This classic is well worth adding to one’s collection.
1,Judge?? What judge????,"There are two episodes on this disc. One makes passing reference to ""Here Comes Da judge!"", and the other has Sammy Davis Jr. as guest throughout, and a few brief cameos, such as Sammy and a few others in Judge garb as they introduce ""Laugh-In looks at the News"". If you are expecting a collection of several skits or of witnessing the way the phrase took the nation by storm, as mentioned on the cover......DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"Great design, but bad color cast","I have a graphics card with two plugs, so I was able to compare this monitor side-by-side with a 19"" X-Brite Sony LCD (one monitor used DVI, the other analog, but I switched back and forth and it didn't seem to make any difference which one was on which for my observations).The Sony was bright and brilliant, and made the HP look positively dull by comparison. One big advantage of the HP is that it can show a true black screen; the Sony's blacks are marred by the backlight ""leaking"" in from the side.However, the deal breaker with the HP was the color cast--there was a slight yellow tint that I couldn't get rid of, even after updating the drivers, and using the OSD to adjust colors, etc. Also, if one raises the monitor's contrast to above 75%, this color cast becomes much more pronounced.I really wanted to like this monitor, but after comparing it side by side with the other monitor displaying the same image, I decided I just couldn't live with the yellow color cast."
1,"Bad, Bad, & Worse","This monitor only lasted me for 14 months and then the screen went blank (dead.) I called technical support and even tried to troubleshoot the problem myself but the bottom line was that once the warranty on HP products expire then (LOOK OUT!!) because you will soon need to purchase a new computer or monitor.I have had nothing but problems with HP's products(I have gone through 2 new computer systems and monitors.) The products do not last for more than four years( that has been my experience.)My advice, DO NOT BUY HP PRODUCTS!!!"
2,Not as expected,I thought this toy is a music box that could produced nice little songs like Fur Elise or Swan's Lake kind of music. It is not.
3,good eighties fun < wannabee revenge of the nerds >,I saw this movie on t.v. about 1987 when it was new. Lots of eighties style laughs w/ obvious attempt to be as funnt as revenge of the nerds. The movie didn't succeed but a good try. I keep waiting for the dvd to be released. LOTS of looking and I found a used vhs on cdnow witch is better than a nothing. Annie sprinkle does a guest scene in the film. Acting is defenetly 80's style but at the time it was great. Film is about a nerd that ends up living in the football frat house. He helps them pass a test on the promise of a date. He delivers the frat doesn't. After a wild long night the nerd wins the jocks girlfriend. The jock is expelled from school.Final: Great 80's Movie for the hardcore 80's collector Thank you
2,"While nice, does not fit ports that are recessed.","While the product looks like a good product, if the port that you plan to use this lock on is recessed, then it is not likely to work with this product. I have several laptops that sit in docking stations, so the lock hole for most normal locks is not accessible while the laptop is in the dock. But the VGA port is on the side of the laptop so I thought that this product would be perfect. And while it came packaged nicely and looked sturdy, it was expecting the VGA port to look like ones on the back of a desktop -- protruding from the board. But on most laptops I found that the VGA port is recessed so this lock will not work. Too bad. I had high hopes. :-("
5,Great For Big Jobs,"Having a large roll of plastic is so much more convenient than buying individual drop cloths. Unlike fixed-size sheets, You can unroll the just the length you need and cut it from the roll with scissors.I had four rooms to paint, all different sizes, so it was very convenient to just buy a large roll and cut the sheets to size."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,THERE IS 5 MINUTES OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AND 95 MINUTES OF COMMERCIAL FOR TANTRA SEX AND THE CLASSES THEY TEACH.
3,great illustrations - poor editing,"Dore's illustrations are fabulous and clearly reproduced, which is the reason I'm ordering this edition, however this book has an unbelievable number of typos which can be confusing to a student of Spanish.As for the illustrations, Dore managed to capture the emotion and humor of the story in each drawing. They are too good to miss."
5,Creative and beautiful,"What a fabulous indie film! It was beautifully and creatively filmed, and the acting was fabulous. I'm so glad I stumbled across this film - you will be too!"
1,Unfortunate,"After the hype about this film and reading the reviews, there isn't much positive to say about it. Trevor and Robert Loggia's acting are great, but the plot moved too slow and it's been done before. The constant buzz about Amelia Island being the setting would have been enough to captivate me seeing my hometown, but there was hardly any of it in the film. I believe the intentions were good, but it awful."
5,A Great Rich Spoiled Kids Movie!!,"Mickey Rooney stars in this movie as a father investigating the death of his son at an exclusive Military Academy where the students thinks that money puts them above the law.also co-starring Terry Moore and Dan Duryea.It's a great rich spoiled kids movie,so check it out!!"
4,Pretty Good Film.,"World War 2 hero Steven Conway(Mickey Rooney)long divorced from his rich wife is looking for his son who he hasnt seen in years.He finds hes in a brutal milatary school on an isolated island.The people in the local town are living in terror and refuse to have anything to do with the school.Steve hires a boat and finds its run by sadistic ex Korean War officer Maj Redfern Kelly(Dan Duryea)Most of the staff including slutty teacher,Jennifer Evans(Terry Moore)are little better.The only one of any help is store owner(Elisha Cook JR)but he lives in fear of the Major.Steve is told his son is dead.He also finds that most of the cadets(Jimmy Boyd,Conway Twitty,etc)are young thugs of every kind.Once Steve finds his son was murdered,needless to say,the major and his thugs(Christopher Dark and Richard Jaeckel)have plans for Steve.Remake of Bad Day At Blackrock.Not as good as the original,but not too bad either."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this mug after searching for several reasonably priced coffee mugs. No matter what I did, I could never get it to seal. The threads were designed such that it always leaked out. And, the first time I dropped it on a desk, the bottom cracked. Not worth it."
1,Terrible,"I have gotten free travel mugs from promotional offers that work better then this. I tested it at home and it seemed fine but by the time I got to the train, my white blouse for work was stained all down the front with coffee."
1,Really crappy PowerPoint presentation,"""The Meier Contacts"" is a poor-quality PowerPoint presentation with an absurdly high volume level. Michael Horn reads a script with a low-quality microphone with lots of popping. It sounds like it was recorded in his bedroom. Plus, the presentation has the artistic value of an eighth-grader's book report. Buy it at a yard sale for 25 cents if you're interested, but don't spend any more than that."
1,I felt ripped off!,:(This video isn't worth the money. It looks like a cheap documentary and the flying saucers look terribly fake!!!!!Buyers beware! Save your money!I was highly dissapointed. I bought it and got upset when I saw the video. It was so cheaply done. I'm glad I was able to get rid of it by selling it on E-bay.
5,Easy to tear,This tape is perfect for sending out packages. It was easy to rip off and sticks well.So far I've used it to send a package back to Amazon.
3,They seem to be bottom of the barrel.,I use this type of tape (Scotch Tear - Packing) daily. I placed an order for several packages and they all are the same - need scissors.
4,Funny and Satisfying,"This isn't one the the latest and greates, but it's a great game to play - if you like playing for the sake of having fun. There are interesting challenges throughout the game. The short games between levels can get very intriguing. Imagine trying to catch bouncing puppies and bring them safetly to their shouting mother or else she turns in to a raging bull dog if you drop too many. The background and music to this game is also conducive to the environment. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys Earthworm Jim."
5,GF Granola,"This Brand never fails to impress me. I've tried almost all varities, and they are very tasty. Having a crunchy snack is always good, and I almost wrote off having granola since being diagnosed with Celiac's. This is also the best price I've ever found and I only order here. I use the free super saver shipping and it comes in 3-4 days!"
3,Just OK,"I ordered this product because of the rave reviews. When you open the bag, it smells like Christmas...Wonderful! But...the flavor is a strong combination of orange, and cloves. For someone who's diet is relatively bland, this was a little overpowering for me. I have tried the Apple Raisin Walnut flavor and loved it."
1,"The Gluten Free Granola, Cranberry Orange Cashew",The product was very unsatifactry. I wasted my money on this product. I would never never recommend it to anyone.
3,Won't do this again,"Price was right but the product wasn't as good as product I got from Bakery on Main directly. It was stale, probably due to storage or age. Not sure but I won't do that again."
4,Works as promised,"I bought one from one of the market place sellers on amazon about 6-months ago, and it continues to work fine in My Dell C600. Much better than paying Dell $150!"
3,A bit disappointed,"This film told a sad story about how Pat Tillman lost his life and how the Army did not convey the truth about his death to his family. This narrative is mostly expressed by Pat Tillman's mother, who explains how she diligently sought out the truth behind her son's death. This is an important story, in that the American military has a responsibly to their soldiers and their families. However, what disappointed me was not hearing more from Pat Tillman's wife -- I think out of all the people who spoke out on Pat's behalf, his wife showed him the most dignity and respect. His mother exhibited herself as angry and failed to accept her son's choice of entering the military. A disappointing section in the film, is when Pat's mother narrated a section while exhibiting a military document, and misrepresented the soldiers in that document. I gave this film three stars because it is a story that deserves telling, however I was disappointed in how the story was told."
3,List all the facts!!!,I find the movie very informative but extremely one-sided. I am sorry for their loss but at the same time it seems like they only tell you what they want you to hear and not all the facts. One Soldier states he never saw/heard anyone else engaging them while another says different. I know for a fact that there were others injured by enemy fire but that was never brought up. It seems like they try to persuade the viewer into believing that there was never any enemy engagement to begin with.
2,unfortunate and boring.,"I love conspiracy flicks and theorist films such as Loose Change, Earthlings, etc. and when I saw a trailer for this film I was expecting some huge government cover-up but really it's just the unfortunate story of why the government covered up the death of Pat Tillman, because they were ashamed a famous American soldier was killed by friendly fire. That's all there is to it. They lied to hide their shame (what's new there). There's nothing else to this film. It's sad and it sucks and my condolences goes to the family but this film is drawn out and a bore to this theorist."
2,more about hurt than Pat,"I was pretty disappointed with the movie. It was more about how the mother is hurt and guilty about her son's death than it was about Pat. I was hoping for more about the story of why a man would give up all the money and fame to fight in the Middle East, but it was really more about anti-war and ""I hate the government"" from the family's perspective. Not was I was expecting. Not what I wanted."
3,PAT TILLMAN STORY,"THE STORY WAS OK AND INTERESTING, JUST THINK SOMETHING WAS MISSING.WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM IT.SUPPORT TRUTH 4 OUR TROOPS, SINCERELY, Boomer Kohli"
4,Interesting,"Not a bad documentary. My only issue really being that what happened with Tillman, is how many other families does this happen to? Yet they don't have the resources to investigate as much as this family did. Regardless it is a sad reality of our times, and absolutely worth watching."
3,Pretty good. Not great.,"This documentary is about the Pat Tillman, his history, and his family's quest to find the truth. It is an interesting story. There are some funny parts, some sad parts, and some conspiratorial suggestions. The camera work is not great, but good enough to not distract from the story telling. I recommend this movie if you are interested in the way that politicians lie to their people in order to keep power."
5,Brave people,"This excellent documentary clearly explains what a great human being Pat Tillman was and the brave persistence of his family and others to uncover the truth. Pat and his family are an inspiration to everyone who seeks truth and justice. Shame on some in the US government and military who deceived, lied, and mocked this great American famliy."
4,Very revealing!,Great work on the documentary! I thought it took the cover off of the given story about Pat Tillman. Hope you can handle the truth!
2,Almost pornographic,"I am a huge Ron White fan, so I hate to give it a low score - but this CD just seemed to me like he sunk to a new level. Almost every track on this CD is a crotch joke and/or relates to sex, and where I am definately not a prud - I felt a little sleazy for listening to it. I was very disappointed. I highly recommend his previous CD ""Drunk In Public"" instead."
5,Ron white is the new king of comedy,"Finally new Ron White material.I'm a huge fan of Ron's but I was getting sick of the same old jokes.This one of the best comedy cds I've ever heard. Ron is defenetly the best out of the blue collar boys, and this cd proves it. Any true comedy fan needs to get this cd. Don't worry if you don't buy this cd at least you'll have an excuse, You Can't Fix Stupid."
1,Totally Inadequate,"When there are multi volume sets on this same subject, covering only one or two years at a time, how can this be useful? The French magazine Militaria runs multiple page articles on individual items of equipment. And I am sure there are others. But I am sure the illustrations are well done. Volstad does excellent work."
4,Nice book about Boeing,"I especially like airliners, and I am not so much into military planes. Therefore the large sections on the B17, B29, B47 etc downgraded my rate to a 4 star. But I must admit, the (military GA-2) section was very funny. My copy is an old one from 1983. So the chapter 'A new era' shows the prototypes of the 757 and 767 and a model of a 7-7 (certainly not a 777). Check out what the new era is now. All aircraft are covered including the lesser known beautiful 307 Stratoliner and the classic model 247. Lots of colorfull pictures, and a informative text. A real nice to have book if you are interested in that other company from Seattle"
3,Other Books,"A coffee table style overview of horror movies, focusing on the various types of classic monster."
2,VERY brief history of horror movies,"Daniel Cohen's book is a short history of the horror film. It does not contain many details but rather explains only basic plot elements for a number of films. It covers the silents up through the thirties in adequate detail, but then glosses over the 1950s and skips ahead to the seventies. It also mentions some of the greatest horror films (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) in only one sentence and describes them as ""violent"" films which offended many people. Horror Movies includes multiple photos of films that it barely mentions in the text. After chapters on the topic of horror films, it sums up their importance in one paragraph. Since this book was published in 1984 and obviously cannot include more recent movies, and in light of its brevity on some of the most important movies, I would not recommend this book."
5,Pure and honest music,"There are two fundamental factors comming together on this release that make it an absolutely ,outstanding listening pleasure.For one, Raul Midon's voice sounds pure and unforced, allmost liberated so that it just flows naturally and it's rich beauty can shine in every word.Secondly, the lyrics are meaningful, positive and filled with such strong images,they easily capture one's imagination.These two factors not only make for a strong combination,but are a clear sign of a great artist in his own right.This is actually one of those cd's that sounds so fresh and inviting, it makes me feel good everytime I play it."
5,IN HONOUR OF THE GRUNT,"Brought the reality of the Vietnam war back on a very personal basis. The writer has the ability to bring the reader back in time and to walk in the boots of the brave Aussie Grunt soldier. As an Austrlian Army Sapper I had the honour of working with men from 6 RAR at the Horseshoe in 1967. Although I joined them on regular clearing patrols, I was fortunate to not have faced the enemy in the way they had to on a regular basis, but if I had, I know I would have had the best of the best next to me. I have always cherished my time with the Grunts and this book just proves how brave those men were."
2,Not much action,"At times I thought this book was very boring, Viet Nam stoies should not just be about things done at the base they should be filled with action in the bush."
2,a little hokie,"I sent this book back - Its basically the myers-briggs at the organization level. It goes through characteristics of the ENTJ organization for example. My problem with it was that the people make the organization and the culture and unless all the same types of people are being hired or cloned and all the people in the org are primarily the particular type then the concepts fall apart. The other thing that bugged me was that the leadership generally sets the tone for the organization so if the leader is a certain personality type then that will probably prevade the organization so there's no need to look at the organization's type but instead to look at leadership and see what type of culture/values they portend andthen work at that level to make change. Anyway, I didn't find this book useful at all - just another spin on myers briggs"
1,He advocates the killing of gays,"In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica, where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a man who might have been gay.When asked to apologize and change his ways he wrote a song about how hewould not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Blacks or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. Please don't support him bypurchasing his music."
3,nice pictures,"this was a disapointment. i thought there would be more information about the jellyfish. the pictures were great. $8.95 was probably a fair price, not anything more."
4,Great story,"Not the best documentary you'll ever see, but an insightful, well documented view of Father Roy and the SOA Watch that you'll find. It is an important film and, hopefully, more Americans will see it and form their own opinions about how our tax dollars are being spent."
2,Not the best execution,"Some of Coby's products work flawlessly. Others were designed to frustrate. This one's smack in the middle. It's hard to insert and remove from the cigarette lighter socket in my Ford. And it picks up the static hum from the car's electrical system, giving my iPod the equivalent sound of an FM station broadcasting from 60 miles away. Nice try, Coby, but I'm disappointed in the execution."
1,Sent Back - Do not purchase in Denver Area,I purchased the Coby CA-739 Wireless FM Transmitter and was disapointed by how each of its pre-programmed frequencies were major Denver Area Radio Stations or had high amounts of static in the Denver area. The transmitter was noisy and weak. I sent it back and purchased the I-River which allows you to program your own frequencies. Low noise. High quality. Much better....
2,Disappointing Gain,"I bought this to listen to my SansDisk Sansa MP3 play thorugh my car radio. The signal amplification so weak I have to turn the volume of both my car radio and the MP3 player to max to hear anything at all, and it's faint and fuzzy.In fairness, maybe the output of the MP3 player is faint, but it works fine through the headphones it came with.I have no choice but to return the unit."
1,This product sucks,"It could have been good, but there's hissing and reception problems. My wife has an IPOD and here wireless transmitter doesn't have this problem. Don't buy - you'll be sorry."
2,Works well but has one major issue,"This xmitter works as intended.It even xmits overtop of some local fm stations I have.My major issue is, it does not have an ON/Off switch.You have to plug in and out to stop xmitting.(turning off my car does not disengage the 12 adaptor)Doesn't sound like a big deal except I keep blowing fuses.No matter how carefully straight I pull the thing in and out, I blow a fuse about 50% of the time.I should have learned by now,you get what you pay for.I should have spent the xtra 10 bucks and got a different model."
3,Maybe too little power...,"Though it certainly works there seems to be a need to get this thing close to the receiving antenna. Otherwise the quality of the audio drops... Also I am having trouble with the stereo jack. If you touch it it will make a screeching terrible sound. I've tried this with three different devices and I've got to the conclussion that the problem is the cable.. :-(On the other hand, the piggyback style 12V outlet is extremely convenient and so is the frequency selector. Just set it to an empty frequency and set your radio memory and you should be ready to roll."
2,Just okay,"Only one station on the unit works with my stereo. its big and bulky. It works but comes in rather staticky. oh well, at least i can kinda hear my music. you get what you pay for."
4,Better that expected.,I purchased this FM transmitter few months back from Amazon and I am quite happy with the same using it in my Lexus. There is some loss of audio which is expected on a FM transmitter but still the quality is good. Setup was very simple. I have tuned it to 88.9FM and plug in my PDA with a 2.5mm adapter or use my MP3 player sometimes and both sound good with volume crancked up on both sides. There is some static sometimes but most of the time I am able to get clear signal. Only negative thing I could say about this is the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter is slightly large so I could not use it in husband's Prius. Overall I would recommend this product.
4,Nice Add On Unit,Just wanted to play audio books thru my car sterio. This little unit does the trick. Works on several channels so you can adjust as needed.
3,"Not the best unit, but maybe the best buy","I've had this for 6 months now, and overall like the unit. First, for $17, it's not bad. However:(1) It's easy to accidentally change the transmission frequency, but not so easy to read the frequency setting while driving.(2) There's no power switch, so if your vehicle doesn't cut power to the outlet when the ignition is off, it's necessary to remove it from the socket when it's not in use.(3) The tip unscrews. I thought I'd broken the unit, but after fishing the parts from the socket, I was able to reassemble it. I guess it behoves one to tighten it occcasionally.(4) The sound quality is marginal, with the higher frequncies attenuated.I wouldn't pay more than $17 for it...."
4,Good for long trips... sensible in the city.,Good piece of equipment if the stations in your region are well distributed. In highways it is perfect.
1,couldnt get it to work,"PLugged it into the pwr outlet and it wouldnt turn on. Tried to turning on the car, even drove around some but nothing worked. IT simply wouldnt turn on. I tried both cars a camry and a carolla both 2006 models. any suggestions"
1,absolute piece of junk,"Opened the bag tried it on two cars, 2 different players and realized that the thing doesn't work. A few hours after trying every possible station on both the cars and a creative mp3 player and a panasonic mp3 player (CD variety) gave up and returned it back. Hope I get back my money (including the shipping), since I never returned anything to Amazon before.Initially the fm adapter part wasn't working. Very obvious since the moment I turn on my player the station would go blank else the original programme on the station would sound. It didn't even work on a blank station.The power part of it wasn't functioning later. Both were camry's in the 1st car the power seemed to work, later on I had to keep it pushed else the power light wouldn't light up. Realized that Coby is something that one should totally stay away from it. I can't remember an ocassion where a product died or didn't function straight out of its package."
1,Doesn't Work for all Vehicles and Poor Customer Support,"This device does not work with my 2004 Toyota Corolla. Apparently, there's something funky with the power receptacles in my Toyota, because this device works with my other car. I've tried both sockets in the Toyota, and neither work, which is bizarre, because my cell phone adapters work fine with the Toyota's receptacles. Anyway, I contacted Coby's customer support for a resolution to this problem, but it's been over a week, and they have yet to respond."
3,Not working properly,"First day it was working perfect, but since the other day it, not working properly!"
1,lasted 64 days then died,"Internal fuse is fine. the flexable hindge seems to be the problem. over period of few days in the end of its lifetime, the hindge required repeated flexing to get it to come on.I don't recomend this product. 21$ = 64 days wasn't worth it. Amazon only covers within 30 days, and Coby (if you can find them) wants $ after 64 days of use then to be without for 2-4 weeks. I learned my lesson when buying online heed caution when others warn you."
3,Not bad for the Price,"I mainly purchased this product to listen to audio books through the MP3 player. I live in a metropolitan area, and have rather strong commercial radio stations either on all the frequencies, or within 0.2 of them. So bleed over on the radio is bad depending on the location of the city. There is a coiled cord that is not shown in the picture that plugs into the audio output on the player. It seems when stretched out, or placed in various locations acts somewhat as an antenna giving better and clearer reception. I had to crank up the volume to achieve just adequate volume. I have not tried with music files yet. For the price it is not too bad, and better than driving with ear buds in. I do like the fact that the flat end is actually a cover that when opened allows another item to be plugged in."
1,Truly craptacular,"The DC plug for the adapter is a bit too big to fit in a vehicle lighter, you have to fight with it to plug it in and it becomes dislodged at the slightest touch. Broadcast is very staticky, and at least with mine if the cord is not positioned perfectly, and even if it is, the slightest touch will send MASSIVE amounts of static. Replaced mine with a different model the next paycheck after I bought this one. Don't waste your time (or your money)."
3,"Remarkable artwork, but no story line","I was a little disappointed in this book as I had anticipated some sort of story line; there is none. This is a collection of paintings and drawings which bear no real relation to one another. That said, Von Gotha is clearly a master of the genre - the art work is exceptional. It is the absence of a story line which causes me to modify my rating, which may be a little unfair, were I rating the artwork on it's own we would have a 5 star work here."
2,"Gotha fans, look elsewhere","It looks like Eric von Gotha emptied out his scrapbook for this one, and then charged us $20 for the privilege of browsing through these unconnected, often unfinished sketches. Let's hope Eric gets back soon to creating more adventures with plot, dialogue, and quality artwork."
3,Her voice is not the best but she has style.,geri will not win any vocal awards. She does know how to present herself and is a good performer. The song LOOK AT ME is a hit in England and could be one in America.
5,Best comic ever,"This is simply the best, and funniest, political comic book ever done. Howarth is one of the great (oddly neglected) comix artists. Those Annoying Post Brothers was superbly warped, Savage Henry was hysterically funny. Fantastic artwork, fantastic story-telling. But for my money, WRAB tops them all. I re-read this comic as if it were a novel by Mann. Find a copy, prepare to be blown away. And don't forget those subliminals!"
5,"great quality, fast storage of pictures","Product works as advertized, great quality, fast storage of pictures, works great with Olympus E500."
4,Same as my Ultra II,"I bought this card for MY Nikon D200. It's a nice card but no faster than my Ultra II. The camera buffer on the d200 is so large that the write speed on this card is really useless. It does download a little faster than the Ultra II, but not by much. If you are buying this for the faster write speed, you will not benefit if you are using a good SLR with a large buffer."
4,*Sigh* If only this CD had the complete score...,"I performed in this musical at the Buffallo Arts Academy back in 1986. It is STILL one of my all-time favorite shows! The score is excellent and the performances powerful. The only drawback? About 1/3 of this beautiful score went unrecorded! Lost are such gems as ""Rejoice, Children"", Nell's gospel ""Take Hold the Crutch"" Lloyd and Lillian's beautiful deut ""What Happens to Life?"", ""Fugue for Four Girls"" and (a personal loss for me because I played Benjamin) ""Flying Milk and Runaway Plates"". If only recording technology back then allowed more recording time. Otherwise this CD is highly reccomended!"
5,Thank you for putting this in cd format!,"I played Lillian in a production in Maryland in the late 70's. It was very difficult to find the LP, but after I bought it, I just about wore it out. Yes, it is missing some of the songs from the musical, but what remains is so meaningful to all ages, from teens to adults. For those of you who have not experienced the life of the ghetto, the songs in this musical were taken from authentic poems that ghetto kids wrote. They are so powerful and the voices on this cd show the torment and all the other emotions that go into this life with violence all around."
4,Excellent show,"This show is very 70's and very rock-ish. If you don't like rock musicals, don't buy this show, because that's just the only way to describe it. But by no means is this the average rock musical - senseless rock songs set to a stupid story - no, this musical has real heart squeezed into every song. The stories of these children really are the moving force to every song, though some of the songs are just meant to be fun, but such songs as ""If I Had A Million Dollars"" and ""Let Me Come In"" really let the stories from the children take the lead. ""Sounds,"" in my opinion, is the best song on this CD, a rock musical with a bit of jazz strewn througout. Overall, I'm so glad this was re-released onto CD after so long, and it's worth your money!"
4,Great Challenge,"I have been looking for this game for my mom for 2 years now. She had a demo originally , all the family would play . If you like challenges this game is great . The colors are so vibrant in this game. I am giving this as a Christmas present. I also know it is something she will love."
3,Use on small branches only,"These pruners were part of a 4 piece set I got from Gilmour. The following is a review of all the tools including, Bypass Pruner, Gear Max Folding Lopper, Folding Saw, and Telescoping All Purpose Hedge Shears. I have found uses for each tool in the set and have been satisfied with each of them. The small pruners help with little plants and have a nice grip. All the tools have a nice non slip grip and our made of materials that are made to not rust so they should last a long time. The extension for the trimmers is a nice feature for cutting hard to reach areas. The saw tool is good for thicker branches and has a nice design that stores closed so you don't get cut picking it up. Lastly the big trimmers have good torque to cut bigger branches. The price is a little high, but overall you can get a lot of use out of these tools. I would recommend this set to anyone who has a use for garden tools and is better than buying each individually."
1,Might as Well Be Fire Fighters on Therapy,"The contents of this book shed no light on the complexities of the self and the creative process or on any sort of relationship between therapy and writing. The contributors just happen to be writers who also happened to have therapy. Big deal! So am I. And my story is about as interesting as most of theirs--which is to say, ""not very."" (There are a couple of exceptions.) Don't waste your money."
5,Bands of Gold,"I was in my sophomore year of high school when I first read this book when it first came out, and that was a long time ago. I remember my dad bought me the book. ""Bands of Gold"" was the very first African-American romance novel that I have read, and I fell in love with it."
5,Memorable !,"Having had the distinct pleasure of meeting Ms. Benson, I looked forward to this well-written and provocative novel with great anticipation. She did not disappoint me! Her characters are well drawn and the story nicely plotted. By the end, I was checking things off that list right along with her main character."
2,Not a Dell charger,"This is described as a Dell Charger...IT IS NOT. It is a cheap looking imitation. However, it worked, and was inexpensive. I have not gotten any error messages, but I have a serious problem with describing something, and posting an image, of a genuine replacement, and then getting something else. The Battery Center should not be allowed to do this."
4,"Not a genuine Dell product, but works ok.","Despite being advertised as ""a Genuine Dell PA-10 Family 90W AC Power Adapter"", this is not a genuine Dell product. It has the exact same size/shape as the Dell unit, but lacks the Dell logo, and appears slightly lower in quality, with a shorter and cheaper feeling cord.The computer doesn't recognize it as a Dell unit either, and gives a warning (both on boot and in Windows) that it isn't genuine and won't charge the battery, and that the computer will run at a lower speed. Despite this, I found that it does charge the battery and the computer runs at full speed.So this is far from a perfect replacement. However, Dell's own units are of such abysmally low quality (I had 3 fail in the first year of owning my laptop), that this one can hardly be worse.Worth it for the price (much lower than buying from Dell), with the above caveats."
1,"Warning, the part is not made by Dell and is not original","In the advertising this product apear as original Dell, but they delivered to me one totally diferent. Is a generic product withouth brand. If you want an original product, don't buy this."
1,Misleading description,"A previous reviewer pointed out the same problem I had. I was specifically looking for a 2-prong adapter. The listing for this item goes out of its way to claim that it is a 2-prong adapter, but what I got was a 3-prong adapter. At this point I'm just glad to have my laptop working again, but I feel like I've been misled."
2,Misleading!,"First off, what you see is NOT what you get - the picture is of a different AC adapter than what is delivered. Also the product description says ""New PA-10 family Dell 2-prong AC adapter"" - it's actually the 3-prong version, which is less reliable. Also: it is NOT COMPATIBLE with my Inspiron E1505 - it provides power, but doesn't recharge the battery! The fact that I'm able to run my laptop at all is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars - you're better off looking somewhere else for your power needs."
1,3 months and it dies,I had this charger for three months and it died on me ...To top it off i paid for express shipping and it took a full extra week... Do not buy this product this is a rip off... I feel they are very misleading in their description.
1,Knock off,"The description says genuine. The tags on the units says genuine. Rated at 90watts. ""NOT"" One of my laptops identified it as a 65watt the other list them as unknown. Either way you can't recharge the battery with a 65watt. So my laptop is tied down like a desktop. Lesson learned.......Buy cheap....that's what you get."
4,almost exactly the same as original,"My adapter is for all intents the same as the original equipment that my dog ate. It powers the computer and charges the battery. The main difference I've discovered is the elastic wrap for storing the cords with the transformer is not on the new one. Maybe people were tying their cords too tightly, which was making the cords wear out. All-in-all a pretty minor note. I bought this one because the advertised weight of the unit was closest to the original's. Several of the other ""equivalent"" units advertised were seriously lighter."
5,Very Happy,This was in perfect condition.Came quickly and was MUCH cheaper than trying to buy it ANY where else.Recommend this seller.
3,Problems encountered,I bought this laptop ac adapter which had the exact same model number as the original one I received with my laptop. Now it does charge my laptop battery but my laptop says that it is not the correct adaptor and will cause my laptop to run slowly. It states to plug in a 65V or high Dell AC Adaptor and in actuality the one I purchased was a 90V AC Adaptor.
1,Disappointing,The plug doesn't fit as tightly as it should in the Inspiron and the battery light continuously flashes between orange and green. I will be paying the big bucks for one from Dell.
1,Junk,I purchased this unit to replace my PA10 from Dell. This charger worked well for a while (3 months) and then it got very hot and burned out. I contacted the seller and they replaced it with another unit. This unit worked for about 5 months then the same thing happened. I tried to contact the seller again but they will not respond.
4,Worked for me.,This worked for my Dell laptop. Not sure what happened with other people. Always check the voltage.
1,don't bother,"this was a waste of my money, my daughter played dress up on Christmas day and that was that. You will find the clothes in the trash by now."
3,Like a tractor pull...,"...it gets out the gate quickly and then grandually grinds to a halt. I thouroghly enjoyed the first few levels of this game as it involved heavy resistance from human characters. The action is fast and furious and keeps the pace moving. As the game wears on, however, the actions of the ""A.I."" opponents become more sparse and predictable as the game essentially turns into a monster hunt. Gameplay is very easy so it's a good starter game for a first person shooter before moving up to something like Half-Life. The game can be frustrating at times as you must do certain things (turn knobs, open valves, etc...) in order to move on to a future level. I would highly recommend getting the handbook or a walk through guide and finding all of the hidden features the programmers put in the game. Overall I enjoyed the first few levels but found myself wishing the game would end earlier than it did."
5,Mr. Cunningham's Excellent Critique,"Because I have begun my doctoral thesis on this very subject, I found that this critique has opened windows that heretofore I have only imagined. Mr. Cunningham must have known his subjects well (or developed a preternatural insight into their oeuvre) and also must possess an astounding knowledge of music, both classical and modern. I would recommend this book to anyone with more than a superficial interest in the subject."
5,"Yes, this is healthy",The first online review is wrong about the fat content of the recipes. At the bottom of each recipe the calorie content is described. The recipes are mostly under 50 or 60 fat calories per serving. NOT FAT GRAMS. With 9 or 10 fat calories per gram that is only 5 or 6 grams of fat per serving. This is a healthy and helpful cookbook. Please diregard the earlier review
5,YUMMY!,"I have been compelled to write a review for any book- until now!I love this cookbook! The recipes are interesting and flavorful. The ones I have made have been fairly simple. Some do require some specialty ingredients, but they are used in many different recipes so they seemed worth having on hand. This is the only cookbook I keep on my counter."
5,development and validation of analytical methods,Really a very well organized manual. Very helpfull both for new labs and labs that should be in compliance with the regulatory requirements.
5,Very easy to use!,"This pipe was great for my back and side yards because it let me decide how much of the pipe I needed. Having two people help expand it is better than trying to expand it yourself, but the pipe did everything you need. If you plan on getting multple extras for this pipe (like the T-shape of the same brand), be sure to get a few couplers (female-to-female) as you'll need them to connect the two 3 inch ends."
3,Not a lot of long term confidence in this product.,"The corrugations collapse far too easily and just feel flimsy. Connecting multiple lengths is entirely too difficult to to effectively and upon receipt there were several small leaks in the pipe which were no big deal I just reoriented how the pipe sat in the ground but it's not a real confidence builder. It is very handy how compact the product is I'll give it that but I'm just not really impressed with the strength of the pipe. Time will tell but honestly if you can use smooth wall solid straight pipe- do it! Oh, and one last thing. Since when is a pipe with a 4"" OUTSIDE diameter 4"" pipe? Maybe no one told this company but you are selling 3"" I.D. pipe and saying it's 4"" pipe. Super."
1,only lasted two years,bought two years ago and just started leaking where i have it bent...maybe it would last longer if you needed just a straight pipe....but then why not just buy a non flexible one. :)
2,Wish I could have ordered all of the parts!,"I need this product only for the winter. I would have liked to have had the option of ordering the connectors for the downspout. If I want them,I'll have to search for them locally.Also the freight for this item was excessive! It was almost as much as the item itself. In the future,I will be very selective of what I order online."
4,It Works,If there is any negative it would be the residue of rain water that is caught in the ridges of the accordion expandability of the pipe. As a counter of that is that you merely pick up the input end and it will drain to the exit end. Worked for me.
5,ok,"I am very happy with this product, received in on time, very good price and work great. I recomend it to everybody."
3,HP Yellow Toner Cartridge,"Product did not come in original box and it took almost 4 weeks to receive.Have not used it yet, bought it as backup for almost empty cartridge."
4,Maximum payback with little cost,"This book, I believe, is based on the author research for RAND. It is an excellent book about air bases defense against attacks from ground forces. Based on detailed case studies, the author pointed out the vulnerability of modern air bases to ground attacks. Although the author also described the effective measures used by USAF to defend air bases in Vietnam, it is very clear that a clever enemy can use a relative small unit to harrass and even cause quite a damage to the air bases.No matter how powerful an air force is in the air, it is still very vulnerable on the ground. And this is really a problem that none of the modern air forces can igonore."
3,worst mustang mountain book yet,"This was my least favorite Mustang Mountain book. Are you supposed to like and feel bad for Alison? She was very bratty. It was an okay book, but I am not crazy about it. All the other Mustang Mountains are pretty good, though!"
3,Good for starters,"I bought tis book a few years ago. It has some good stuff of how drawing relates to animation. It also sheds more light on to the process than a lot of books. However, after a few years of animation art school, I realized how bad the drawings were. If you want to learn about drawing for animation, check out Glen Vilppu's books. (he worked as a drawing instructor/trainer at some of the bigger studios in L.A.)"
1,"Avoid this book, it's an embarrassment","Oh my, where to begin...I posted some images of a few of the drawings from the pages of this book on the customer images link above. Feel free to take a look at those to see where I am coming from.The authors of this book need a few drawing lessons themselves, though I'm not sure that would actually help, because they're beyond hopeless. The drawings in the book are beginner level, amateurish drawings and it's really sad to see that these guys are actually teaching students in an art school.Aside from the obvious lack of personal drawing skill on the authors' parts, there is a lot of bad advice from an animation drawing point of view, like too much emphasis on measuring and copying the model and a completely misunderstood/misrepresented view of the all-important line of action.Stay away from this book. These guys should be ashamed of themselves for putting this crap out there."
2,Its more of a very lengthy article than a book on 2d animation,"I made the mistake of buying this book, and I would like to warn you guys please , please dont waste your money on this title...This book is nothing more than a long overview on drawn animation , It is not and I repeate it is not a how to book , although the authors have tried to present it as a text book, its no more than an introduction to animaton drawing ,the authors try very hard to explain drawing and go all blah...blah...blah....but they dont tell you what to do , whats mentioned in this book can be known via a simple search on the net.I would advice customers to buy a copy of, Vilppu Drawing Manual by Glenn Vilppu and Animation : The mechanics of motion by Chris Webster. These books are practicle , simple , cheaper and would prove to be a thousand times more useful to the animation student."
5,Third Time is a Charm!,"Recently Scandinavian Heroic Power Metal bands such as Sonata Arctica, Dragonland, Lost Horizon and Supreme Majesty and a couple from Germany such as Freedom Call and Edguy have been stealing the thunder from Italian Power-Metal groups.One Italian group Domine hasn't backed down though. Their third effort, Stormbringer Ruler is one of the best Epic Power Metal albums to come out of Italy recently and is Domine's best to date.Many strong songs including ""Horn of Fate"", ""True Leader of Men"" and one of the best Power-Metal songs by anyone, ""The Ride of the Valkyries"". Not as cheesy or speedy as Rhapsody, more imagination than Labyrinth, more consistant than Skylark, more experienced than Desdemona and Dragonhammer and almost as good as Thy Majestie. Give it a shot."
1,I'm very disappointed.,"Sorry to disagree with the otherwise unanimous five star reviewers. After listening to Eschenbach's fresh rendering of the Dvorak New World Symphony, I had HIGH expectations. Alas, I agree with the reviewer drawing comparisons with Otto Klemperer. To me, the pace was mostly plodding, lacking in excitement, and the overall sound was kind of muddy. Even the Haydn Variations just poked along.In fairness, I'm spoiled from listening to very best Brahms ever recorded. I'm speaking, of course, of Bruno Walter's monumental Columbia recordings from the early 1960's. Szell and Furtwangler also seemed to ""get"" these works. I guess I respect a conductor's attempt to do ""something different"", but Eschenbach's Brahms falls very flat with me.If you love Brahms, get the Walter set. It's definitive."
4,Adults and kids alike will enjoy this novel!,Karen Autio's first novel is superbly researched and ably written.Bravo!
5,A richly detailed and compelling story,"As you begin reading, you quickly discover that 11-year-old Saara's dream is a trip to Finland to meet her grandparents. But the book's title and cover art have already given you information Saara does not have: she has a date with destiny on the ill-fated last voyage of the luxurious RMS Empress of Ireland.En route to that May 29, 1914 date, you will find a young girl confronting the joys and tensions of family life, sibling rivalry, a father's job loss, the changing loyalties of friends, the challenges of school, and the ever-present need to scrimp and save and spend both sides of every penny.Karen Autio immerses you in the rich world of Canada's Finnish immigrant culture, giving you enough time to get to know everybody on a first name basis, before she plunges you into the cold waters near Point-au-Pere in the St. Lawrence River where 1,012 lives are lost."
2,Quite possibly the worst book ever written...,This book was absolutley dead. The writing could have been a lot better. It seemed to me that the author figured out the plot as she wrote--never really getting to the intended point. Mindless ramblings highlight numerous chapters and confusing descriptions abound. Characters never seem quite as real as they should be and it all develops into a lousy book. Don't read it.... trust me. You're wasting your time.
2,don't bother with this one,"I purchased this book with anticipation as it is of a genre that I thoroughly enjoy but was very disappointed in this book - the book was 'slow' and disjointed and the ending - well, there's no other words for it - it sucked! I couldn't believe that it ended without any real resolution to any of the main character's issues. I would have expected better from Lynn Abbey."
5,"For less than the ""Small Price of a Bicycle"", pick this up!","Very well done rock music that does hold your complete attention from start to finish. It's all here: An Anthem-like, pulse-pounding album complete with touches of melancholy and dashes of mayhem, ""Small Price of a Bicycle"" certainly delivers on all of these fronts. It may just be The Icicle Works most complete and satisfying collection of songs. That being said, how can you go wrong?"
3,Lover of My Soul by Alan D. Wright,"I love Alan Wright's work, but this book was a slow read from the start. I expected some heart-shattering information, but did not get it. It is solid material, thought, and for those who are looking for affirmation, this is good."
3,My feelings about The Lover of My Soul,"I have written a book by the same title, and when I found out about this book and reading the other reviews, I bought the book. But after reading the book, I was disappointed. The book didn't take me there in intimacy with the Holy Spirit. It talked about Him and situations of modern day and how good He is, but it didn't take me there, into that secret place with Holy spirit. It didn't show me how to get there either. It still left me as I was before I read the book. My book , on the other hand, not only shares my experiences but also shows you how you can go there yourself and encourages the reader to desire Him and hunger for Him and love Him and receive and experience first hand, His amazing, yet tangible Love, in intimacy with Holy Spirit in His Chambers.The Lover of My Soul: A Woman's Journey and Experience of Intimacy with the Holy Spirit in His ChambersMary Ann Bryant"
5,Great Book--- Mark Twain at his best!,"I have read most of Mark Twain's books and what a great surprise I had when I started reading this book. Joan of Arc, as Mark Twain once said, is his best book. It's amazing how he could write the facts with such richness without losing the pace of the story.Fast reading and moving..."
1,Kindle edition is riddled with OCR errors,"This is the first Kindle book published by Ignatius Press I have purchased (and I have purchased many) that is riddled with typographical errors. The frequency with which these errors appear is increasing as I continue, having read about 2/3 of the book so far. Usually, Ignatius Press ebooks for Kindle are exemplary in their production. But this one is distressing. Did the proofreader stop working and go home? Did the editor bother to take a look before submitting it to Amazon? I bought my copy last year for $4.75. Maybe this is why the price has dropped to $0.99 now?"
5,the best representation of Joan of Arc,"I first began my interest in Joan of Arc after being confirmed with her as my saint. Mark Twain's book was one of the first, though fictional, accounts I read about her. He brings the grace and spirit of Jeanne D'arc to life. Many other books or films concentrate only on the deeds of her life. While, Twain conveys how important Joan's religion is to her. God was part of every aspect of her life. This one characteristic is one of the many that makes a true saint. I think that if Joan could carry through with such miracilous deeds she would have been the same as Mark Twain described her. This book in imcomparable to any other book of her."
3,Joan of Arc,"A fascinating story, but the Kindle version has an incredible number of very obvious typos, which really distracted from an otherwise great read."
2,Mark Twain may have liked it...,"Mark Twain considered this work to be the best material he ever produced. With almost reverent respect for Twain, I beg to differ. While claiming no great expertise on the historical figure of Joan of Arc, this work falls far short of giving any sort of objective description of her life or accomplishments. This work falls more along the lines of sugar-coated heroine worship suitable for a 10 year old than it does a historical narrative of a live human being.Mark Twain was a first-rate story teller and humorist. Few have risen to his level. Unfortunately, he mixed his inclination for a good story with historical fact and the result is neither a good story nor historical fact.There is good reason that this is a little known work of Twain's."
