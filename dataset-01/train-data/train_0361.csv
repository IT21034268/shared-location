5,The Bucket List Really Hits the Bucket!,"This is a really good movie. It seems a little sad at first - both guys have terminal cancer. However, the plot quickens quickly when Jack Nicholson's character discovers Morton Freedman's character's ""Bucket List,"" and set out together, no expenses spared, to really see the world and all its possibilities. They have some amazing times together, and most who see this film believe this is the best way to go!This was a new movie. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
4,Inspirational,Similar to the bucket list show on MTV... makes me wanna go write one! We've watched this several times and is our go to movie when nothing else is on. Gotta love Morgan Freeman too!
4,The Bucket List,"Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson played their characters impecably. Unfortunately, Nicholsons character's language was unnecessarily vulgar. That seems to be par for Nicholson. Therefore, I cannont recommend it for a general audience or someone not use to poddy mouth talk. As a former U.S.Navy sailer, I have heard similar talk, but do not care for that kind of language. As an overview, I would say the movie waS entertaining but I will not be viewing it again."
3,As a comedy is misses the mark,"2.5 stars. Cute concept but in the end just a long series of depressing events. Maybe it's a clue for all us to start on our bucket lists sooner rather than later. Still, as a film it's not very memorable. I saw it a week ago and I'm just remembering that I watched it and needed to post a review. Nicholson is Nicholson and of course Morgan Freeman is narrating. (If it ain't broke then don't fix it, eh?) Overall, it's just okay."
3,This album is for music lovers only!,"This album was alright. ""My name is"" is nothing like it is on the radio. Some songs are good, others bad, but I didn't buy this cd by myself, my friend told me to! By the way, the beats are dope!"
1,BEATS ARE TIGHT BUT THIS IS LYRICALLY WEAK ALBUM..,Eminem got's skills but his oral methods ain't nuthin very brilliant. Bottom line: This album sucks!! His nasal voice like irritant.
2,Uh ......it's not that great People!!!!!!!!!,"Okay. Eminem is good at putting things together and riming and stuff. But, seriously he isn't that great some good rappers put more depth in there music. Eminem sounds like he thought up a few cuss words and some stupid stuff to rhyme with it and put it together. I really like the beat in My Name Is. It's good. BUT THE WORDS ARE PROFOUND!!!!!! If u want 2 listen to good music don't listen to this crap!! Try OutKast or Beastie Boys. Seriously people this guys may be hot for a while but he's really going to be a joke."
5,WE KNOW THE TRUTH,"TO ALL THE REAL HEADS OUT THERE,WE ALL KNOW THE ORIGINAL VERSION(BEFORE ACTUAL RELEASE) IS WHERE ITS AT."
5,Eminem aka Slim Shady is one rollin' whitey,"When Eminem started being played on my college's radio station, we thought ""What in f#@# is this?"" But after listenin' to his rhymes and stylins for a bit, we realized that Dre has got something hot on his hands. I'm all for the No Limit Soldiers (straight out of my hood in NO), but this white guy has got some catchy, funny, and smooth rap."
4,BeSt C.D iN dA wOrLd!!,"Eminem is the best white rapper out there! Everyone should get this CD! It's da bomb! ""My Name Is"" is a hit! It's got good music and good lyrics. It cracks me up every time!"
5,"I bought this CD, and Eminem is the best!","my favorite song on this CD s #11:My Fault. it is the best....about the shrooms. the only thing that got just a bit annoying was how he couldnt sing a song that didnt have anything related to drugs. every song had drug related content. but i guess that is ok.Eminem is maybe a hundred times better than the backdoor boys and 'n sync.....and those other wanna be new kids on the block boy bands. WHITE RAP IS DA BOMB!! (eminem is better than puffy, too!!)"
3,There are only two good songs on the entire CD.,"I really like Slim Shady, but I did not enjoy the rest of the CD like I thought I would."
5,Original and lyrically talented,Eminem's album Slim Shady is awesome. It has cool beats and original lyrics. This kid has serious skills.
3,what a relief,"Finally, hip-hop that's funny again. Earlier rap was so much better, because the artists didn't take themselves so seriously. Does everyone remember the Fresh Prince's ""Nightmare on My Street""? Eminem, while having no where near the same style as the Fresh Prince, has a similar attitude towards the music. It's a nice change of pace."
4,HIP-HOP LIVES,enimen raps and spits out lyrics that really send a message. he hits home with beats and styles new to hip-hop.
4,Great cd,"Okay, so i did not give it a straight up 5 rating, as you probably have noticed. The reason is this is probably the most graphic and disgusting cd i have ever heard. I bought it and was horrified and put it away for a month. One day I picked it back up, after all the eminem hype had died down, and i realized that this cd is great. Sure its graphic, offends probably ever living person, and is not at all appropriate for younger kids, but its hilarious. The beats are great, the lyrics tight, and surprisingly eminem has a lot to say. I have to admit that i hate the ""I never meant to give you mushrooms girl"" song (face it, its no good) but the rest are great. My personal favorite is role model, and "" dont give a f***""and "" still dont give a f***""are also good. If you have a weak stomache and are offended by lots of stuff, stay away from this. However, if you want to hear a funny, sharp, and intelligent commentary on pretty much every aspect of life, pick this one up!"
4,Slim Shady LP,"The Slim Shady LP is a very good album. I used to listen to this CD for hours at a time. Most Songs are good, a couple a pretty bad, but the great songs like Role Model, 97 bonnie and clyde, and Just dont give A F*** Make up for the crappy songs, This in my opinion is Eminems second best album, right below the marshall mathers LP, Which Is The rawest eminem CD to date."
2,"For a great lyricist, this album was just garbage.","Man, after having tracks on Soundbombing 2, on High and Mighty's first album, doing a song with Thirston Howell III, some of his Bad Meets Evil ish and being featured on Sway and Tech's wake up show, I would have expected a lot more than this. Now the bad Meets Evil song is sick, which I feel is the best one on here, and Royce da 5'9 does a great job of holding his own. But then there are crap songs, like My Name is, which is pure garbage. That is sad, since Dr Dre is behind the productions, which should be tight for the mastermind of beats for NWA, but man, what the hell were they thinking with that song. Eminem is great, not the greatest lyricist, but great. To bad I can't say the same about the album."
4,A Must Have,"One of the best debut cd's by any hip hop artist. The cd has some great beats (Courtesy Of Dr. Dre) and awesome lyrics. Yeah, it could be considered offensive but who cares, it's only words, just buy it and bump it. The reason I gave the record 4 stars and not 5 is that although it's a great album, his second cd, The Marshall Mathers LP is much better. The beats are more defined and it just sounds a lot better. Great disc though, buy it."
4,Sweet!,"After buying Eminem's current cd, I decided to buy his 1st one. In my opinion, this cd is more mild than his current one. ""The Slim Shady LP"" contains funny and witty songs. The rhymes shows how talented Eminem is. The best songs on this cd are, ""My Name Is"", ""Guilty Conscience"", ""Brain Damage"", ""'97 Bonnie And Clyde""(a twisted song about Eminem killing his wife), and ""My Fault"". Every song is funny! The downside is, you may get offended. The lyrical content is bad. If you get offended easily, don't get because you will be quite appaled. All in all, this cd is pleasing and very entertaining. A must have for your collection."
5,classic,"One of the better rap albums of all time, I got this cd when it came out over 10 years ago and it still hasnt gotten old"
4,"Funny, Cool, Great","Hey I love the CD. THe best songs are: ""Brain Damage"" ""I'm Shady"" and ""Still don't give a *uck"". And if u ain't down wit dat u can go hum* your self."
5,EMINEM IZ THE BEST F#CKING WHITE RAPPER I'VE HEARD.,I love MY NAME IS;GUILTY CONSCIENCE AND AS THE THE WORLD TURNS
2,Lyrical bombast,"Hey all you crazy kidz. We can't sell Mr. Mathers short now can we? 2 stars for effort. I bought this CD to check out the new breakthrough in white boy rap and found all this kid was doing is trying to pull off what the brothers do better. This CD is full of shock value, i.e. my statements are ignorant and their only purpose is to slap you in the face. Well... Slim is certianly not the first person to attempt this. Secondly he seems to be trying a little to hard to push his ""I don't give a..."" image, so much that he comes off as a womanizer and a bigot. I would have more respect for eminem if this record was the record company's idea and he's just playing along to bank, I mean we know their is a world of twisted kids out there spending their summer job money on this and taking it to heart, and that is the truely sad part. Lastly if you want to hear the pioneers of true white boy rap, listen to the Beastie Boys, they've actually got something worth while to say."
1,"Brother says ""Step Off""",Emminem can't rap to save his abarcrombie and fitch rear. This album is like a tribute to Vanila Ice. His lyrics are weak and his message is stale. He needs to get back to the Gap at the mall and leave rap to brothers who know how. DMX is in the house and will bum rush the M&M show. True dat.
1,What A Stupid Album,"Wow, Eminem is SO cool! I really love the song where he repeats his name over and over and talks about how cool he is! Oh, wait, that's ALL the songs."
2,"The sickest, most disturbing thing!",I got the edited version because Im not allowed to get unedited and still it is horrible! Throughout the CD he talks about drugs and violence and killing people. It is just sick and disturbing. it gave me nightmares! If you listen to the lyrics you will understand what I mean. Dont get this unless you wish to be discusted. The only good thing about it is the tunes. Thats it!
1,Will the real slim shady please SHUT UP!,I am so tired of his whiney vioce! Get some real talent and I'd like to see where he ends up when Dre. kicks him to the curb!
1,Revised....,"Okay maybe I was a little harsh with my first review. I still don't like Eminem, but I do have to admit the boy has some talent....He's just needs to use it. Look, even he admitted that he does stuff to shock people, same when writing lyrics. It's a shame, he's just letting that small amount of talent slowly flow down the drain."
1,"This is one of the most disturbing pieces of ""music"" ever","Enjoy this album? Listen to ""97 Bonnie and Clyde,"" and I guarantee you will dropkick this CD to the moon. Sorry, but murderous music just has to meet the boycott trial.Oh, yes, can you believe that they make a 'clean' version of this little pile of ***?"
1,Eminem is the worst thing happened to rap or hip-hop,Yeah thats right.Really from the time he came into the rap gamerap became more commercial and pop.Also he is overrated and the most commercial and most famous rapper of all time.Fukkin azzhole.He always win an Mtv or Grammy award.I hope you die.
1,Why Do People Fall For This Crap?,"Yeah, just another worthless punk who thinks he's the toughest person in the world. They're all the same.Rap sucks. C'mon people, find something better to listen to than some nasal-voiced moron rambling on about violence and prostitutes. So he had a rough life, big deal. Many people have had it much worse than him, but you don't see THEM writing boring, monotonous songs about it.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is what music has come to. Sad, isn't it?"
1,This CD is horrible,"Eminem can't rap. He's got a very annoying voice i would like to punch him so he could not talk i hate his voice so much.If you want white rappers go get ICP. The only good song is ""Guilty Consience"" and that is because of Dre singing."
1,bla bla bla bla bla,"whooppty due, another new raap arist trying to put food in his stomach. if i may ask, where has the emotion and talent gone to these days? if i had one wish it would be for government regulation of rap, and hopefully that would suppsidise it. peace out homey"
2,At least it was free,"A kid at school taped this for me. The first couple of songs are good but then the album seems to get worse and worse. ""As The World Turns"" was good, but that's all I remember. Oh well......"
2,"Dont get this one, get Marshall Mathers","I'm serious about this one...there are some good songs on here, but it just dont cut it compared to Marshall Mathers LP. Take my advice and get Marshall Mathers instead of this one."
4,"One Great Rap Album, Not The Best Eminem","Let's all start with the pros for this album. The album is witty, shocking, and downright hilarious at times. Now the cons. At others, it can be lame. One problem is the skits. They are not very good. However, this is Eminem's first and most joyful album, which is sometimes a sigh of relief. At other times, I wish that we would be able to hear a little more aggressive side of this fantastic rapper. Some songs certainly outshine others. The best song on the entire album is 97' Bonnie and Clyde, along with great moments from I'm Shady, Role Model, My Fault, and As the World Turns. Even the ridiculously popular and catchy My Name Is can become boring after several listens. For the best experience, turn the bass off on that player. The words outshine the beats on this album. Definitely one of the better producing jobs by Dr. Dre or Eminem. To close out, buy this album if Eminem is your favorite artist, or you love rap like me."
3,Nascent greatness...,"If this was your first exposure to Eminem, then it is easy to appreciate how great of a rap album this is. However, it really only hints at the towering achievements to come...specifically the one-two punch of ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" and 'The Eminem Show.""Here he sounds less focused, less expansive...too 'ordinary', if that's even possible. Not that this is bad...he swings for the fences, but gets a ground-rule double. It goes out, but bounces first.It's essential, though, because I feel Eminem will prove to be an artist that will transcend his genre. No way do you anticipate ""Born To Run"" from ""Greetings from Asbury Park"", nor could you have expected ""Who's Next"" after ""My Generation."" But those early steps are essential.As is this."
5,The Beginning:,"This is what made Eminem known to the world. Em put a stamp on hip hiop history that will never fade due to the ""Slim Shady LP"" Just one listen to the album makes the listener realize the great wordplay and smooth flow of Eminem's delivery."
4,A Real Start,"If you have Eminem's first album Infinite, toss it and buy The Slim Shady LP. Eminem's alter ego Slim takes over in all tracks but one i can point out and that's Rock Bottom. This Grammy and MTV Award winning album is a keeper for any fan of this Rapping sensation"
4,HAVE YOU HEARD...,"Slim Shady won't let you down! This CD is full of hilarity (My Name Is, As The World Turns) as well as passionate self-expression (Rock Bottom, Still Don't Give A F..k). Eminem is a masterful MC; and to all those young people out there who derive a delicious enjoyment from saying ""F..k you"" to something, this album's for you."
5,EMINEM IN THA HAUGH!!!!!!!,"Every body's talking 'bout how this cd is for like psycocrackheadfreakwannabes, but what about movies from wes craven, music is about entertainment, this is kind of like a horror movie on cd. And people who like that kind of shxt should get it, cuz it's the atom bomb!"
5,"Marshall matthers is hiliarous, talented, & full of life!!","I thought that the cd was hiliarous especially the lyrics. Althought there is a lot of swearing in this album it doesn't cut it down one bit...in fact, it makes it better. M. Mathers is one talented individual & i'd love to meet him. So what's next??!! :o)"
4,Funny but sick,I did enjoy listening to this c.d. A friend of mine had it and i began to listen. The lyrics are quite sick but you have to have a sense of humor while listening to it. i cracked up at every song. So in conclusion i liked it even with the sick images that are created in my mind.
3,What is with the white rapper stuff?,"Ok- I used to have this album but gave it away. It's not bad.. it's just not my type of music. I like a wide variety... he has skills, but it is mostly boring to me. What is with the people making a big deal cuz he is white? Or dissin him cuz he is white? He is in NO WAY the first white boy in hip-hop to have skills. Madchild (of Swollen Members), Evidence (Dilated Peoples), Ryu (Styles of Beyond), Everlast (formly of House of Pain), and Beastie Boys all have more skills then Emenim... and all are white. Besides Beastie Boys and Everlast most of you have probably never heard the others because you don't know REAL hip-hop, you just follow whatever is on MTV. When it comes down too it color has nothing to do with it..."
5,"(MY NAME IS) It's the best! I LOVE it lotzzzzz, 2 much!","This song (MY NAME IS) is one of the best songs that I've heard in a really long time. I was really surprised when I found out that Slim Shady was a white guy! One of my (girl) friends says she thinks the song where the guy says ""he's pretty fly for a white guy!!"" She says those are the perfect words for describing Slim. I agree!"
2,"Good beats, but bad lyrics.","As I listened to this CD, I thought it was ok. There are really only two good songs on it, ""My Name Is"" and ""Guilty Conscience"". The rest of the songs are alright, but not good enough. Also, some of the lyrics are very disturbing, like in 97 Bonnie and CLyde were he talks about taking his son out to throw his murdered mom into a lake."
2,THIS CD AIN'T THAT BAD Y'ALL PEOPLE ARE SAYIN',"There's a couple of good joints on it and you can listen to this a couple of times before you get bored. So this is one of the worst rap albums made by a white kid but it's not the worst album ever made. Still don't waste your money. Rather check out A Tribe Called Quest, OutKast, De La Soul, Jurassic 5, Roots..."
2,the edited version stinks get the original.......,the edited version stinks get the original. They need to stop tampering with the original stuff and have the original shine
2,This CD wasn't nearly as good as I hoped.,"I bought this CD since I like ""My name is"", but to my dissapointment, the rest of the CD is just filler. I'm trying to get rid of it since I can't let my little brother listen to it. It's boring, uncreative and most of the songs have little to no beat. Don't waste your money like I did!"
1,Buy this Hip-Hop Classic if you're into Vanilla Ice or NKOTB,"Hey! My name is Slim Shady! This is my new hot-to-def joint. My real thug name is EmiNeM and I'm a white gangsta rappa. My favorite food is chicken and I like also A Tribe Called Quest. But I'm not stupid. And I'm not fooling you if I'm sayin' that this album is the best cd ever made. period. My idol and best friend is Vanilla Ice. I Hate Beastie Boys cos they suck. I'm the Young Gun! I've got a phat nasal voice wit da dope street attitude. I'm representin da white kidz to da fullest, nahmean?!! I'm da rhymer king. Da Freestyle specialist. Peace Out. Buy my CD and you'll be a better in every way.."
1,BEATS ARE TIGHT BUT THIS IS LYRICALLY WEAK ALBUM..,Eminem got's skills but his oral methods ain't nuthin very brilliant. Bottom line: This album sucks!! His nasal voice like irritant: I wanna smack this lil' vanilla ice's face everytime i hear his stupid voice.
4,Slim's so crazy...,"Eminem is my favorite rapper of all time. His music and his sound are very different from other rapppers. This album is crazy, funny and shady. My favorite tracks are: ""My Name Is"" ""Brain Damage"", ""I'm Shady"" and ""If I Had"". If you like crazy, and twisted fun then you should buy this album. His second album (""The Marshall Mathers LP""), is also a good and crazy album. To the people get offened or don't like Eminem or his harsh lyrics, here's my advice to you: DON'T BUY HIS ALBUMS!!!!!"
5,my review,"I think this one of the best cd's ever recorded.One of my friends has the cassette and I liked it a lot only my mum wouldn't let me get it which really stunk because she hasn't listened to any of the songs on the cd and ""My Fault"" makes up for ""97 Bonnie and Clyde""."
5,I love this album,"Morons who dont know S@#$ say that this album sucked, Dont listen to them this is a masterpiece.1 introduces slim shady2 Remember where you were when you first heard this song 9/103 Dre's appearance turns this song from good to great 9/104 Talks about his childhood entertaining. 7/105 skit6 touching song he should do more of this 9/107 Only 2 rappers have perfected bonnie and clyde 2pac and eminem 9/108 skit9 Great beat funny song 10/1010 skit11.dont do shrooms 9/1012 skit13 same bass line from drug ballad just him talking smack 8/1014 if you like track 6 you will like this 9/1015 great song 9/1016 skit17 my favorite eminem song i was laughing my ass off 10/1018 cool song 7/1019 shows how bad he is 8/1020 finishes it off eminem stylepeople say its stupid disgusting i say its classic find out for yourself"
4,Eminems best album,good if you arent a fan dont buy it download im shady and bad meets evil and other tracks8.5 lyrics of 10 8.5 of 10 beats
4,EMINEM'S BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM,"THOUGH EMINEM HAS HAD A LOT MORE SUCESS WITH HIS NEXT 2 ALBUMS, THIS ALBUM STILL REMAINS AN EFFECTIVE ALBUM TODAY. THIS ALBUM TRULY CAPTURES EMINEM'S MOST PROFANE, MOST VIOLENT LYRICS. SONGS LIKE ''MY NAME IS'', ''BRAIN DAMAGE'', ''JUST DON'T GIVE A F***'', ''STILL DON'T GIVE A F***'', ''ROCK BOTTOM'', ''BAD MEETS EVIL'', AND ''ROLE MODEL'' ARE ALL EFFECTIVE SONGS. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE TYPE OF HIP HOP FAN THAT LIKES THE TRUEST HIP HOP, YOU WILL DEFINITELY LOVE THIS ALBUM."
4,"Eminems debut, obviously","Ok, this is not as well made as eminems other two albums, since dre only makes three songs, but is still a great cd that you definetly should buy if you have a strong stomach, as eminem has some pretty nasty stuff in his songs. I'll list them in order from best to worst in my opinion, songs seperated from skitsGuilty ConscienceRole ModelIf I HadBrain DamageRock BottomBad Meets EvilStill Don't Give A F***My Name IsCum On EverybodyI'm ShadyAs The World TurnsMy Fault97 Bonnie And ClydeJust Don't Give A F***SoapB****PSALoungeKen KaniffPaul"
1,Ugh.,"As much as I'm supposed to rate a CD on how good it is, I couldn't do so because the CD was literally making me nauseous. Luckily, I didn't have to pay money for my copy, but at least I won't have any problems unloading it on anyone, judging on how many positive reviews it's getting.I really wish I could say this is a good CD because I liked the music, but I felt the lyrics were so violent and misogynist that it was making me sick. He describes getting rid of his ex-wife's dead body. I was told this is supposed to be funny.Sure, make your verse funny. But don't joke about beating the snot out of women and pass that off as humour.I am by no means a prude (I own and regularly listen to CDs by Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, and KoRn), but this CD really crosses the line."
1,garbage,"The subject matter is trash, plain and simple. MTV should have better ethics than to promote this indecent album. Regardless if you buy it for ""the beat"" or ""the music"" you are still telling the rapper to continue writing lyrics with this subject matter. Whoever buys this should be ashmamed. Eminem, do me a favor and write with class."
1,Good Groove Bad Subject Matters,"I rated the clean version with three stars, because I do like the beat of this cd. However I am rating the dirty version with one star because the subject matter is VERY offensive. I buy lots of cds that have dirty language on them, the dirty language doesn't bother me on this particular cd. The subject matter is what bothers me. He's rapping about having indcent liberties with a minor. He's rapping about killing his' little girl's mom and then dumbing her in the river. He's rapping about drugs, murder everything thats against the law hes rapping about. It does have a great beat, it does have artist style, but the subject matter is where I draw the line. If I had a teenager under 18, I would only allow them to buy the clean version. The clean version has a tacky censoring job, (full of scratch sounds instead of curse words), but this dirty version is really where I draw the line. Everybody has to draw the line somewhere. Everything isn't ""ok""."

4,really good!,"this cd was really good, but the editing could have been just a tad better. ive listened to the unedited too and i like it better, but then thats just me. i recomend the unedited before this one, but for all of those with ""virgin ears"" this is the one for you. the soneg are great, and eminem is really good at letting the rap roll smoothly off of his tounge, i love this cd, its REALLY good!"
5,THIS ALBUM HAS THE BEST RHYMES I'VE EVER HEARD,EMINEM AND COMPANY FLOW ARE THE ONLY(NOT REALLY THE ONLY BUT DEFINITE #1 AND #2) ARTISTS PUSHING RAP INTO THE FUTURE WITH SKILLS OF TRUE MC'S.
5,I Love Eminem and this is the best cd EVER!,I LOVE Eminem! and i love this cd. i think he is the best rapper and this cd is the best rap cd ive ever heard. really. BUY IT!
5,EMINEM IS THE HOTTEST AND BEST RAPPER EVER!,"This is the BEST cd EVER! Buy it! Eminem is the best most talented rapper. and this is the best cd, and you really should buy it. all the songs are so good and the words are great too. its my favoriate cd!"
3,I think this CD is pretty good,"The reason why I think that this is a pretty good CD is because he is a good raper and his lyrics are kinda funny, actually the songs are funny just like his song ""slim shady"" and the song ""just the two of us"" about him killing his baby's mother. I thought that it was hilarious."
1,disrespectful,"this alternative mickey mouse squeeking rapper immensely exagerates fictious tales of murder and rape, meanwhile claims to be the white representation of hip hop, the truest, most profound expression of feelings we posses.peace,2"
5,eminem is the best white rapper ever!!!!!!!!,Eminem is the best!!!.eminem's lyrics are tight as *ell!!!!!!not that many white people can rap and when you find one like enimen then they are a major break through. He looks so fine!!!!!! he has alot of profanity but it still sounds fly!!!! he rocks and I hope you buy his album!!!!!!!
3,HHHMMMM,"I got to admit Eminem is an awesome rapper. THE thing that really makes me angry is that , He would of flopped "" With the BLack population"" with out Dr. Dre. I think everyone knows that. I am not going to hate on him, but that is the only reason . It is really sad how all the little girls could't get enough of the pictures to put on there walls. It is also sad how many young white males got sucked into trying to look like him. Including me :("
4,Very Funny lyrics,It is a must have CD for any hip hop fans. This is the new aged style so you better prepare yourself!!
5,It is about time someone stepped up stop hating!!!,"Alright now for all the hating going on all over the world, it makes me upset that people wanna dis this lp. All that my man is trying to do is show everybody that if you want it bad enough you can have it. Stop hating,Start enevading,and Start participating."
4,tight,listening to My Name Is.He's going to be a star for a while.Look out for Slim Shady.He tells it like it is.
4,Wicked rhyme flow.,A friend of mine gave me a promotional sampler copy of this album about five months before it's general release and I really liked it. Then I purchased the CD when it was released a I was very pleased with the beats and the rhyme flow. THIS KID HAS SKILZ.
4,slim shady is off the meat rack!!!!!!!!,"the dude is real comical ,in which he brings another side to hip-hop.I think eminem is real creative with the lyrics!"
5,The CD is blazin,"Slim Shady rhymes with a high shock value but maintains a comical nature. Don't buy it if you have no sense of humor. ""I'm Shady"", ""Role Model"" and ""As the World Turns"" make you want bounce and bust out the lyrics along with this crazy cracker. Support Detroit, buy the LP."
4,Certain to be in heavy rotation,"People who are getting offended by this CD need to lighten up. It's funny as hell, and Eminem certainly has the mic skills to play with the big boys. This is the freshest album to come out this year (and one of the few that doesn't feature a guest track with Jay Z on it, which may explain why I enjoyed it so much). Don't let ""My Name Is"" fool you; the rest of the album is far better. Standouts include ""Bonnie & Clyde 97,"" ""Rock Bottom,"" and ""Just Don't Give a F**k."" Listen with a light heart and an open mind and I guarantee you that this music will be in heavy rotation in your CD player. It's good to see Dr. Dre spinnin' hits again. Keep 'em coming, please."
5,i thought it was great!!! plus he is really HOT.,"it is one of the best songs & videos.i love him. WOW. i mean what can i say,i am in love with him"
5,This C.D. rulz,"I really don't like rap, but one day, I was just chillin and watching MTV and up comes a guy named Eminem. I thought ""My name is.."" was soo funny. Especially when he did the President Clinton scene and the Marilyn Manson impersonation. Eminem is going to go all the way and no one can stop him. YOU GO EMINEM!!!!!!"
3,Not bad!!,"This CD is ok. I would not say it is great or say that it is bad. I think it could have been done a little better but I still like the CD. ""My Name Is"" is a great song!!!! This CD is worth getting."
4,Good Rap!,"This is definitely one of my favorite rap albums. It's funny! I really, really like the title track, and pretty much all the other songs. While I may not be the biggest fan of rap, this is a great CD and I often listen to it."
1,ShockValue???,Shock Value??? Are u Kidding??? Pop Star femimem is not threating to anybody! Not even a 10 year old girl! He is tha Justin Timberlake of rap! A sissy nasal voice pansy who can't rap nor even make shocking lyrics...Nobody really takes what he says to heart! He's gotta be tha biggest sissy boy rapper in hip hop and tha worst rapper of all time! Anyone that want reel shock value that isn't for mainstream loser kids! lisen to Ganxsta Nip or ICP! If Eminem is soo baddass why doesn't he attack ICP wit a decent diss...ICP's Diss tore his whole image and career up...iz called nuttin but a *itch thang! So STOP talkin bout eminem shocking!!! Tha Sissy boy attacks lil girls like christina agulira! what a B*tch! STOP CONTRIBUTING TO THIS MTV BULLS*IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,i don't know,i only bought it for my name is and my fault .so i don't know about the other songs. i just think its okay i hope you people out there don't have a problem with that.
2,Nat a rep ov eminem,"Eminem iz 2 unseryus en thes CD, hes betr en MMLP kuz mi bartndr frend let ma lesten ta et,"
2,Slim's debut not so hot in my eyes,"I bought this Cd because I loved ""My name is"". That song got old almost as soon as I bought it, though. I never liked any of the other tracks from the Cd. I am a alternative fan. I will never give up my love for alternative music, but rap is slowly getting on my better side. Hard-core like DMX, Jay-Z, and even the softer Nelly are starting to become some of my favorites, but this album is not. Although I want his new Cd, I often find me mad at myself for paying $17 to own this one."
2,Wait a minute - I thought I was the REAL Shady!,"I was callin' myself Slim Shady back in the 1980's. First this guy rips off Vanilla Ice and now he rips off me.What's next? Is he going to start doing Martika songs? (Leave that girl's stuff alone, Marshall.)"
1,he is at least funny,eminem is funny but still wack.i just don't feel his flow or style.if he took his twisted style and flipped it over some Biz Markie beats then it might work.but overall everything on this disc musically is a little to catchy.
1,Eminem is the worst i have ever heard,"I was up late one night, before this stupid cd was realeased. I heard ""My Name Is"" i thought it was okay, so i got the whole cd, and i hated it. It has no meaning.I've always loved ""Insane Clown Posse"" and i still do. Eminem is just the worst i have ever heard, same with his ""Marshall Mathers LP""If i was you, i would listen to Insane Clown Posse"
5,Da Bom,This CD totally kicks @ss! Da best song is '97 Bonnie and Clyde. Anyone who disses it should go *uck themselves. 'Nuff said.
5,Best hiphop album of the year!,"The Slim Shady LP by Eminem is the best hiphop album I have ever heard and it is one of my all time favorite albums.This album has it all: good beats, funny lyrics, serious songs, and hilarious skits. It even has a dance song!All twenty tracks are hits. The Slim Shady LP is a great album so buy it!"
5,This CD is as funny as hell,"The songs are great and funny! Most of his childhood reminds me of mine. Plus, I usually like offensive and funny stuff. I have yet to get the CD, but I hope to soon!"
3,Working it out.,From INFINITE to this work Eminem was clearly on the way to greatest. It lacks the commercial polish of THE EMINEM SHOW and that's no bad thing & it displays hints of greatness. It was the original shelf shocker & parents found him abhorrent. THE KIDS LOVED IT! Its shows a skill like no other yet it's rough & could be better. Check it out to complete collection otherwise opt for THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP for classic Eminem.
2,uh....just read the review,"Eminem is my second favorite rapper(Dr.Dre #1)and i'm NOT sayin this is a bad album,i'm just sayin it's weird.My Name Is,Role Model & Guilty Conscience are possibly the best tracks,and the rest are not so good to great,but weird.I don't know why,but it just dosen't feel like Em.The tracks have weird beats and lyrics...but overall,the album is good...I just gave it 2 stars because it's clean and the curseword blurtting is kinda annoying.I could've reviewed the dirty version,but I just wrote all of this text and I ain't backspacing it.Clean....2 StarsDirty....4 Stars"
5,DEtroit White Ass,THis iz another white foo. I dont really like this CD as much as his others but the lyrics are really good. He talks a lot about his child hood but honeslty listening to this cd bores me sometimes. Buy it if you're an eminem fan but really?the question is who doesnt have this cd. its already old skool and its perfect for a cd collection like mine. CHI love to the fullest
4,It's Worth It!,Check this album out. It has the rhymes. It has the beats from Dre. And it is funny as hell espically the intriludes. I gave it 4 Stars because this album is not like everyone's album. It is explicit and dont know why you would buy the clean version because your going to get nothing but instralmentals!
4,Read that review Please...,"Ok.. The lyrics of Eminem can be offensive for a bunch of peoples but it's only for Eminem's fun. But he loves her baby and he's just makes this lyrics for fun. Hey! the movies and T.V. show at the young kids the war and violence.If you can't listen to the Eminem lyrics, who's is funny (if you're not taking them seriously), you should not open your T.V. because it's {offensive}. That my view of the C.D. So buy it if you love it!"
1,Eminem What ever,Yo I'm not the kind to be disen but I have my own opinion. I think that Eminem is wack and he's song are wack. He's voice is just wack. I understand that he is different and have different style. But he's style is not my style. But I give you props for try'en
2,"Beats are Tight, M & M is WACK","Just another Vanilla Ice! WACK! BUSTER! TALKS ABOUT KILLING HIS WIFE WITH HIS DAUGHTER!! Next album will be even worse, then he'll start doing Rock.... Dr. Dre's beats are tight though, but I'm heated he signed a white(TRASH) boy!"
3,Some Sick but all ready released on the EP,"this cd is almost the same as the ep eminem just made this release commercial some say this is his best cd but that statement would be true if it was all new materialFavorite Track:Bad Meets EvilGuests:Royce Da 5""9 and Dr.Dre7 of 10 lyrics 7 of 10 beats"
5,Ill sh*t,"Yo, mad heads have been puttin slim on the down cuz' he's white. Man, F*ck that!! With a person who has that much skill, he could be bright pink and it still wouldn't matter. To many hataz hatin on his color. Get to the real issue, he is a raw mc. He stands with the rest of the top dawgs in my book. Recognize TRUE skill in it's original form. word."
3,it's pretty good but the lyrics are MeSsEd!!!,This album was good in the idea of music. But the lyrics are so totally messed! The things he says and the messages he sends out are screwed up.
4,"ITS GOT A TIGHT BEAT, AND PRETTY FUNNY.","I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO FIRST, DIDNT KNOW WHO IT WAS. THEN A FRIEND BROUGHT IT UP FROM ORANGE COUNTY LA. AND I GOT TO HEAR IT ALL, ALL AROUND IT IS A GOOD ALBUM. I LIKE 97 BONNIE & CLYDE"
4,excellent album,excellent album i enjoyed listening to this album because of the great lyrics and and funny style of rapping
5,it's all the honest truth,"this cd is a best seller in my book. Eminem has finally represented Dr. Dre's company with ""Slim Shady LP."" There is only one flaw in this Cd through my eyes. The flaw was #13, the fast beat lyrics did not work, Eminem is very talented with fast beats but this one did not work. But the other 19 songs were bumpin. Thanks for the sounds Eminem a.k.a Slim Shady b.k.a Marshall Mathers."
5,What The Hell,"Anybody who thought that this album wasn't the bomb, is crazy. They are just being bitter because a white boy (no offense intended) is coming out into the rap game and he has beter lyrics than a lot of other rappers out there. Give respect where it's due."
5,The best white rapper around by far!!!,"Yo, this boy ain't another Vinalla Ice, Eminem's lyrics are the s..t! All of you need to stop dissing this man. Who cares if he's white? f..k that wake up to yourselfs this man has got mad skillz, he's on the best label{Aftermarth} and he has the best producer{Dre}. Congradulations Dre Eminem's gonna bring you more platinum hits then Death Row ever got you and if I was Snoop Dogg I would sign to Dr. Dre's label because No Limit is s..t and now that Mystikal has left it is gonna be the worst label."
4,You gotta get used to it at first,"These lyrics are probably the most explicit you will ever find. It can be fun to listen to though, the rhymes are creative, but most do not technically rhyme. For example, in ""My Name Is"" the beginning lyrics are ""Hi kids, do you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?"" Now, violence and eyelids don't really rhyme. There are many rhymes like that. The lyrics are also sometimes violent, especially in ""Brain Damage."" If you want an example, one line is: ""She banged me over the head with a remote controll, opened a whole in my head and my whole brain fell out of my skull."" Yikes, huh?"
3,"It's cool, but there's only 1 good song!","Emandem is awesome, and i love his hi, my name is... song, but there's really no other good songs on the cd. i would prefer a single."
5,YEA,"THIS CD IS REALLY COOL. THE REASON HE IS A RAPPER IS BCUZ HE GREW UP IN AN ALL BLACK NEIGBORHOOD, AND HES WHITE SO HE GREW UP WITH A RAP/HIP-HOP INFLUENCE. JUST THOUGHT YALL SHUD KNOW. IM OUT YO -BrAnDoN"
5,"Great, Absolutely amazing!!!!!!","This cd is one of the best,Funniest and entertaining cd/tape I've ever heard. Eminem has a real future for him. One of my favorite songs of his is ""Braindamage"" The Lyrics are amazing and funny, I know the whole song by heart. I would give this cd a Grammy and on a scale from 1 to 10 it would be a 10. Eminem is plain rap!! His Lyrics are absolutely Phinominal! I wounder why he didn't start earlier in his life. I also wonder why no one has ever come up with these Lyrics before. This cd is truly a winner!!!!!!!!"
4,I realy like this cd!,"Ilike this cd alot.But my parents didnt! the only reason I got the eplicit was cause its cheaper. So I advise kids to use that as an excuse.PEACE, C-DOG"
2,Overrated ...,"The production overall is pretty boring and cookie-cutter. Eminem, while being pretty clever, is overrated with a boring, redundant cadence. There are a few great tracks (Guilty Conscience is a banger), but all in all this is not a very good album. I felt that it was very overrated when I first heard it back in 1999. If you want psycho-rap, stick with Dr, Dooom."
1,A White Rapper?,"Wow! I never knew whites can rap. I mean white men can't jump either but having a white rapper is a joke. I mean look what happened to Vanilla Ice, just think about it and don't waste your money on this album. The only reason I gave this album 1 star, because there isn't a 0 star icon to choose from."
1,this ain't all dat,"this cd ain't all dat cause it only gots 1 good song and the other songs ain't dat good. lets face it white guys cant rap. dont get dis cd, aight. peace out."
1,ill,"DIZ IZ 1 DOPE CD, YO! da only ding dat wud mak it da illest phat disc evr wud be more o dem rapez an drugz and da murderz. dere wuzn't enuf o dat wack flow, yo! if any yu playa hatas out dere dont send da reespect to da peeps for da madd original skeelz da boy be showin wit da tite rhymz, yall be posin, and best check ya self. itz da sick beatz, yo! AIIGHTT?Oh, wait a moment. I think I may have had a bit of a problem expressing myself. What I meant to say was that Eminem's latest offering was a waste of time and money at best. Recommended for severely compromised intelligences only. Enjoy, yo!"
1,"Horrid, caucasian tripe.",This CD is the most infantile and offensive recording in music history. Anyone who purchases this CD should be examined by a clinical psychoanalyst. Mr. Mathers should be ashamed to even consider putting his name on any record ever again.
1,"Not Offensive, Just Cowardly","The people who supported this wimpy, anti-human swill will be the same people who won't admit to even owning this stuff when the wind shifts back to social justice. Truth is, this record is full of racist and mysogynist stereotypes and that's the effect it has: telling the world it's fun to be a bigot. Shameful."
4,they always playin my song,this is eminem's first album and its a really good start but not as good as his next 3 albumsBest songsbrain damagedguilty conciuencerole modlemy fault
2,The world has one more Vanilla Ice this morning.....,".....and dear Eminem, just chill out and stop bragging about your hatred for Christina Aguilera."
1,This cd got worse with time,"The cd is funny but as Eminem grew, his talent shrunk more and more. This cd shows you that hes funny, but as soon as his soft side shows, he realized it and started to crank out soft tunes to sell more records. I fell for it but then I realized this man doesnt care about rap, he wants money. People who still love this guy after 8 mile and Encore, are the dumbest people to walk the earth. It proves the world is a cess pool."
1,THE CRAP MUSIC LP.,"When will the mindless mtv sheep out there in trendy land realise that this loser is all about stupidity and shock value.Am I supposed to be scared or offended?No,so get over the shock value people and start using your brains.This cd has boring and repetitive beats.It also has the same pointless and ridiculous lyrics that you can expect from someone whos trying to make money off of simple minded people.This clown would be jobless if it wasnt for all his brainless fans.Him winning grammys and mtv awards show you the pitiful state that music is in now a days.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
1,overrated barely talented hack,Proves again white people can't rap and rap has gone south with gangsta crap
1,GO TO HELL EMINEM,"Eminem hates the world. He hates his mom, his girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend, his dysfunctional family, and the critics. He's a whiny white kid who is making money off of his self-absorbed ego trip. This guy is a novelty act. Nothing more. The only thing Eminem is good for is a place for my schlong to go right between those white buns of his."
3,Eminem LP,"From what ive heard of it,the only songs on here that are good are,""My Name Is"",""Guilty conscience"",and""Role model"".But most of the lyrics are about killing his wife,and jumping off of a tree with his penis tied to a rope. I suggest that you buy real hardcore/gangsta rap Cd's like,NWA,Dr Dre,Ice Cube,and Snoop Dogg before you buy this."
5,Groundbreaking,"This album is fresh. I heard My Name Is.. on the radio for the first time back in early January. Not only is he good at it, he's hilarious."
5,"Great songs, but with a negative approach.","I loved Eminem's new album, but i think he should try to change the lyrics a little because everyone listens to him & he's kinda a role model."
3,don't do drugs,"compared to a lot of true hip hop artists, lyricly speaking he has skills (# of stars), but what could he do for his next album? talk even more deeper about more drugs and murder? i predict this phase of hype to be distinguished within close to a year or so. i'm jus expressin my humble opinion, so no playa hatin involved here.peace"
3,This cds pretty good,"Hey this cd isnt all that bad so please yall that say it sux quit, i agree there is only one good song, but please quit sayin that nuthin on it is good cuz ur wrong."
5,You have to get this sonic-boom-to-your-nuts CD!,"This CD is one of the best (if not one of, then THE BEST) I've ever heard. All the beats and flows of Slim Shady's music are smooth. The songs are hilarious and fun to listen to. I personally like My Name Is, Guilty Conscience and 97' Bonnie & Clyde over the rest of the songs. But that's opinion. Others have others. Question to some 1-star reviewers: Why are you rating Eminem 1 star for being a white guy who sings rap? If you're going to give Slim Shady 1 star, give a greater reason than relating to ""White guys can't rap."" Eminem shows that they can."
4,It is a pretty dope CD. You Know for him being white and all,It is a good Cd if you are not into positive hip-hop. It takes on rap music with comical lyrics and pretty dope beats that you can chill with.
3,"Some funny stuff, but the rap doesn't stand out","Eminem may be a funny guy, and this album has some good songs in it (My Name is, and the stand-out Still don't give a F___)but Eminem is far from a five star album here. His rap lacks flow, as Eminem tries to stuff too many words into too little time, and at times not even rhyming!!(The perfect example from ""My name is:"" ""A guy at white castle wanted my autograph/so I signed it,'Dear Dave, Thanks for the support A-------'"" That doesn't rhyme!! ""Castle"" rhymes with A------, but, but he sets it up so he's rhyming A----- with ""autograph!"")He may be trying too hard to be offensive and not hard enough to show real skill in rapping and mastery of rhythm."
4,Clean up the lyrics and it would be great,"I had heard all of this stuff about eminem being straight from the devil and his music is so terrible and everything else. I had heard, ""My namr is"" on the radio, and it was pretty cool. Finally, I borrowed the CD from my brother. After listening to the whole think, I must say I was truly suprised. After I got past the shock of his extremely explicit lyrics, I realized that this guy has true talent, which is very rare amongst rappers there days. This album is full of good beats and tight rhymes, and all-out talent. Eminem is amazing. Personally, I am not found of his choice of words. If he would clean them up a little, i think he would get more respect and maybe then people would give him a chance and hear his true talent."
4,"White Men May Not Jump, But There's No Doubt They Can Rap","No, he's not a good role model. And seriously, this album isn't to be taken seriously. And no, ""Tying a rope around your penis and jumping from a tree"" is not cool. But if you want to enjoy some really great, head-bobbing beats with audibly addictive lyrics that represent white teenage America's ridiculously bizzare underground lifestyles and gruesome thoughts of murdering your baby's momma, then this is a great album. Like the first track says, ""This album is not to be taken seriously."" Well, I don't, and I love it for what it is - tight beats and a lot of fun."
4,A decent album with some great lyrics!,"If you like Eminem's current releases,then this is recommended for you.Buy the uncut version but avoid the clean version(most of the lyrices are blanked out).But the album does suffer from a few minor flaws;some tracks are just people speaking for a few seconds and is a waist of time.Also,tracks like IF I HAD and ROLE MODEL are rather bland and repetitive but apart from this,the album is still an essential buy.Get it now!"
1,Depends on what kinda flows you like,"If your into Hip-Hop then you may like this, many of my friends have bought this, but I just don't feel it, I can't even picture this guy being a G. He tries to hard and his flows are pathetic. But he does have his own style and it seems to be working for him so I gotta give props to that. I only like the West coast beats and even then I don't like all af them, he just seems like another Kid Rock to me, a Whiteboy trying to act black."
1,NO STARS FOR THIS GARBAGE,"THIS IS GARBAGE, NOT EVEN MUSIC...ONE BURNING QUESTION REMAINS: CAN YOU REALLY HAVE A GRAMMY 'BEST OF' RAP ALBUM THAT IS MISOGYNISTIC AND CONTAINS EXPLICIT LYRICS? BUT THEN AGAIN, I GUESS THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF A GRAMMY AWARD..."
1,"Pathetic, stupid music","Fifty years from now we will (hopefully) look back on this ""music"" as some of the most laughable junk ever to be created by a mumber of the human species. The same is true of all of eminem's albums.Why is a no talent...""mc"" elevated to a status far above some of the finest black lyricists of today? Forgive me for bringing race into the picture, but I beleive that much of eminem's popularity is due to the racist attitudes of white america. As usual, the true innovaters of the music are given less credit than the white boys that rip them off. Overall, this album is as rediculously melodramatic as a 1920's theater soap opera. I don't sympathize with this [person]. For quality music, check out Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Common."
1,Y'all don't know what it's all about,"For all of y'all out there sayin' that this is the best hip-hop album ever, ya just don't know what it's about. Have you ever heard of Das Effx, Redman, Method Man, Boogie Down Productions, anything! This album is wack, plain and simple and so are all of y'all sayin it's the best album ever. That's my word, peace."
5,the greatest rapper of all time with an all-time best,"Eminem is the best rapper of all time.In the eyes of a critic hes white, in the eyes of his fans, hes a lyricist with the attitude.His lyricas are awsome with a little pinch of uniqueness on the side.Dr.Dre has found the second coming of Noctorious B.I.G......but in white form"
2,Slim Shady Is for The Children?,"Eminem definately has talent. And slick production. But it's sad a lot of his fame is built on the controversy thing. No, this is not an album for children. But Yes they buy it cos it's half marketed their way. (WHY?)But anyway what about the grown ups? ('m actually only half way there and technically a kid - 14)I personally get sick of swear word after swear word and ego rap all through. There are better rappers out there who don't need to rely *fucks* and stories about their *bitches*. I don't find it attractive. Don't sit there and say 'oh she's a party pooper.' I do have tolerant ears and I have fUN with musicBut he can also be funky, and yes he can rap. I originally quite liked this but I soon bored of the *themes*You can't figure this guy out easily. I'd rather just bypass him.Aceyalone rockS!"
1,IM SORRY I CANT PUT 0 STARS ON THIS PIECE OF ****,"THIS IS THE WORSE PIECE OF **** I HAVE EVER HEARD. THEY SAY THAT WHITE MEN CANT RAP BUT THEY SURE AS HELL CANT RAP, SO THE LAST THING I HAVE TO SAY IS EMINEM IS ** STUPID LIL WHITE BOY"
4,Original - Brilliant if you don't take it too seriously,"This 'white rap' album, although it has some offensive and violent connotations, is really just amusing. Eminem is not afraid to express himself, and I dare you to compare it to most other rap albums and tell me why this one isn't great. The CD is meant to be funny and not actually offensive, just like South Park and The Simpsons on TV. The CD is also an interesting mix - it goes from My Name Is, a clearly mocking rap song, to almost a regular rap album (which has edge but is seriously not as violence-oriented as others). Bottom line: buy this album, and just enjoy it. Don't take it too seriously or think that this guy is giving serious advice. For obvious reasons, I wouldn't recommend this CD for very young audiences."
3,Terrible Editing job!,"I bought the edited version because thats all Walmart carried. I was extremely disappointed at how bad it was edited! It sounds like a cd full of scratches! I think a clean version is ok for teenagers, but the job they did editing it is terrible. Scratches all the way through. If your'e old enough, then buy the explict lyricks copy if you want a copy. The music is cool if you like hearing jokes about taking drugs, attacking women, or sex. Although I disagree with some of his themes he has got a groove going. But the editing job is horrible. I may buy the unedited version so I can see what he said. I am over 18 after all!"
5,Slim Shady rules!,"Slim Shady rules! I think the best song is ""Brain Damage"" and ""my name is""! If you are a goodytu shoes...don't buy this CD! Because it rules! I think eminem should win a grammy! Eminem should make some more #1 songs and then he'd rules music world! Oh I forgot he already does!!! ""Shady wait a minute thats my girl dogg!"" I don't give a damn! trace sent me to take the world all!"" Bye peaceout and Eminem rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,EMINEM HAS NO TALENT!!!!!!,"The song MY NAME IS is so ANNOYING, EMINEM sounds like a six year old, EMINEM is going to get old VERY FAST because the SH*T he's doing SUCKS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hey Slim...this album is shady....,"Man, if you thought Q-TIP sounded like he had a cold on Low End Theory (although he still rocked it) give this fool some nasonex. Refunds, anyone? This joint is (what?) this joint is (who?) this joint is (huh?) played out and tired. The Dee Barnes reference was funny....hip hop is dying y'all....."
1,why?,"can some one please explain to me why so called leading edge magazines like spin and rs are jockin this guy so bad? he has NO flow his lyrics are shallow ignorant ramblings with no real emotion or depth. Simple fact is that eminem is a media creation. Dre should be ashamed of himself for even giving this no talent hack the time of day. the fact he's white as nothing to do with his cd being horrible. Real heads now that hip hop isnt about color, its about keeping the music alive and real."
1,Don't you mean M & M,"This is the worst cd I have heard. . .my friend left it in my car and I threw it out the sunroof. It is a fetal attempt at hip-hop. Let's face it, fellas, the only reason this fool without a cause is on the charts is because of MTV and teeny boppers. His lyrics are sickly, and so is he. Plus that he's a typical sellout. Just watch. Do yourself a favor and save the change."
4,"I'd give it five, if it was not so predictable","This is my first rap album i ever bought. I usually don't like rap, but after hearing ""My Name Is"" on MTV (what i found to be the EDITED version)i decided to give Eminem a chance. I must say, that if you are someone who takes things in a very very literal sense, i advise you not to buy this album. Eminem is a VERY sarcastic person, and he jokes about death and killing and drugs throughout the whole CD. In fact, he does this SO MUCH that it becomes predictable and dull. If you like rap, you will probably like this album (depending on your tastes). I like it, i just hope that he doesn't use the same words and themes (death, drugs, i'm a white rapper boo hoo hoo no one takes me serioulsly) and there is more of a variety on his next album."
5,The Most Disgusting Thing I Ever Heard,"This album may be disgusting, however, it is also hilarious. This is a great album and worth every penny. The first time I listened to it, I thought ""what a perverted sicko."" But now I love it. Eminem is the best rapper out there, and surprisingly, he's white. But he's no Vanilla Ice. He does just as good as those black rappers, even better. So Don't judge him by the color of his skin. he is a great rapper. And will go down as one of the best ever. Peace out!"
2,Not that funny. Just stupid.,"Eminem is an extremely slow, clean, rapper whos songs are really bad. ""My name is"" is only somewhat funny, and only for the first few times. Cept for the Beasties, white guys should STAY AWAY FROM THE MIC, I dont care how good some of your reviews are."
2,Good Production...limited lyrics,The delivery and style of eminem is original and fluid but the lyrical content is poor. Eminem seems like he is attempting to shock rather than inform. Lyrics about drugs and violence...heard it...many times. Nice to see a white rapper attempting to get into the biz...but anyone hungry for great skills by a white rapper should listen to MC Serch....now he has skills
4,Has talent but...,no matter what everybody else is saying I still think the lyrics are very hurtful. But if you don't take them seriously I can see how this could be a good album. But not 4 kids. Whatever.
2,CREEPY,"I give M props for the funny one-liners, for the story rimes, for having his own sh#t to talk about, and for the de-troit white trash details.BUT THIS WHOLE ABLUM IS ABOUT KILLING HIS BABY'S MOMMAcreepy...not funny....creepythe album cover of the cd is his baby's momma's dead body in the truck of a car -- and if you listen to the lyrics, he about to throw the body in the water as his baby watches.he tries to play off his fantasies like it's a joke, and goes on to explain that he's not a role model.i dont give a f#ck. M is seems like a sick little geek that would torture animals and wet the bed.also -- there are only 2 cuts where he keeps the jokes up enough to be entertaining. he's lucky that there aint that much competition in his arena right now. there are a lot of funny m.c.s out there."
1,It was really bad,I am definately not a racist.I Don't hate Eminem because he's white I hate him because he has no talent. I think the reason he's doing so well is because he's white when he raps he doesn't rap like he is comin from the ghetto where he claims to be comin from like nas or RZA.Eminem thinks that if he swears alot he's gonna get respect from other rappers or somin well he's wrong all the songs were funny/stupid and didn't make no sense. What's up with ken kennif?
4,"""Hi my name is...""","Eminem has become 1 of my fav rappers because he's witty, different and has pure talant. When i try to rap i try to use his dark evil joke style for my raps. If u8 don't like Eminem then ure probably jsut sayin that to be different or u like ICP who sucks! This is not my favorite Em CD i like te Marshall Mathers LP more the beats are a lil better in my opinion!"
3,HE SORT OF GROWS ON YOU,"SLIM SHADY STICKS TO YOU LIKE SUPER GLUE. WHERE EVER YOU GO YOU TRY TO IGNORE BUT HE'S RIGHT THERE AROUND EVERY CORNER AND SPEAKER YOU PASS BY. YOU HAVE TO BE NUTS TO LIKE HIS LYRICS BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIS RAP, IT ALMOST MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY DO LIKE IT***JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE."
5,This is the best CD of 1999 and has the best view on life.,"Eminim shows what life is really like and how people live theirs. I love ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" it has good music and the baby sounds so cute. Eminim's music memorizies me."
1,Too bad you can't choose less than one star!!!!!!!!!,"Props to Eminem for Slim Shady, and My Fault. As for the rest of the Slim Shady LP, it is horrible. If you are into buying an expensive cd for less than three decent songs, this is the one for you, if not, catch Slim Shady on the radio. Catch it fast though, because if Eminem can't do better than this cd, you won't be seeing much more of him. Sorry Marshal!!!!!!!"
5,This review will be about an awesome album!,"I think Eminem's ""The Slim Shady LP"" (Edited Version)is awesome and my parents say even though its edited, it is still bad for me to listen to. I'm 12 years old for cryin' out loud. Anyway, Eminem is the best white rapper ever so buy this awesome EDITED CD!!!!"
1,Totally disgusting!!!,I think that Eminem needs to learn some manners and figure out what the world wants in a music star today.
5,Good Music,"The music on the CD is fine, the cuts are not good though. Eminem should have just had other ""tame"" lyrics instead of the ""LP-played-backwards"" sounds! Otherwise the CD is good espcially 'My Fault', 'Guilty Conscience', Don't give a F*ck', ''97 Bonny & Clyde', 'Brain Damage', 'Rock Bottom' and 'As the world turns'"
4,The Slim Shady LP,"If you're a new Eminem fan, I reccomend getting the ""Slim Shady"" LP. I like this album better than the ""Marshall Mathers LP."" This CD has classics such as: ""My Name Is,"" ""Role Model,"" ""I'm Shady,"" and ""Guilty Conscience."
3,Deadringer - 'Electrocution Of The Heart' (Grudge),"Late '80's one-off record that featured three old time names from the '70's, original Blue Oyster Cult bassist Joe Bouchard and two members of the original Alice Cooper group, Dennis Dunaway on bass, guitar & backing vocals and Neil Smith on drums along with Jay Johnson - guitar & backing vocals and Charlie Huhn (Ted Nugent, Foghat and Victory) - lead and backing vocals. Nothing too special here, but okay 'melodic hard rock'. A couple of tunes worth mentioning are ""Everybody Rock"", the ass-kicking ""Love's A Killer"", ""Balls Out"" and ""Bring On The Night"". Not sure, but this often hard-to-find CD might go over well with the Quiet Riot, early Whitesnake and Fastway crowd."
5,"Small Towns, Small Minds","What a great new character! Skye Denison is a woman who says what she thinks.Valedictorian of her small-town high school years ago, Skye talked about ""Small minds and small intellects"". Now she has to come back to the same old small town to make a living as a school psychologist. Busy-body relatives, quirky small-town personalities abound.The insights into school psychologist work were very interesting and entertaining as well.Skye uses her wits and her professional abilities to solve a murder which occurs during the annual Chokeberry Days festivities.A nice look at a small town, and a great debut mystery. Well written, and well edited. I can't wait to see more of Skye!"
5,I'm hard to please!!!!,"I think I have found another author that I really like. I'm addicted to Sue Grafton and a few others, but haven't found a new author that I look foward to. I guess her new book will be out next year. It was a fun read that unfortunatley didn't last long. I finished the book in one afternoon. Read the book and have fun!!"
3,Okay beginning,"Despite the interesting array of characters, the plot isn't a deep mystery and is almost a series of events that just falls into its own conclusion. Skye never did much amateur sleuthing as far as I could tell, with luck on her side. Also, while I did enjoy the people, sometimes they felt a little overdone to the point of putting in too much forced comedy. There were some cute and amusing moments, but this isn't really a laugh out loud sort of book, more of a cozy (which is always good). The small atmosphere fits the story - and the series - perfectly. Some of the dialogue seems a bit stifled and forced, not completely genuine, but overall this book was a fun way to pass the time and the pace kept my attention to a maximum.Overall a fun and light read without enough substance to stand out too much. I really dug Skye as a heroine and look forward to reading about the characters again."
5,Great series start!,This is a great first book to this series! Definitely a strong start! I have read many of the other books in this series and this is one of the top!Skye is a school psychologist and there is a lot of great interaction with the kids at school as well as with the rest of the town itself.
2,It was okay,"The cover of this book caught my eye and even though I hadn't heard anything about the author I decided to give it a try.It was a light, easy and mildly entertaining read. When I read mysteries I never try to guess who did it. I prefer to just enjoy the unfolding story. However, I figured out who did it without even trying. The story wasn't very original and the motive behind the murder was so (for lack of a better word) lame.I may give Ms. Swanson another try just to see if she has improved."
5,Very enjoyable,As a school adjustment counselor I was thrilled with this heroine. Fun to read... great characters...Read the first three books in the series quickly and recently ordered the next four.
5,Great CD,"This CD was the catalysts into my love for chant/kirtan music. Many great artists on this CD including my current fav's Jai Uttal and Krishna Das. Also a great chant by His Holiness the Dalai Lama chanting the Green Tara Mantra. The tone is reverent and peaceful. Get this Cd, you will love it."
1,Adios Amigos/Joshua the black rider,"Be warned...SHODDY transfers of these Fred Williamson classics. The Legend version of 'Adios Amigos' is far better (even though it's not 2.35 widescreen) than this hunk of trash! This disc is unwatchable!! Amazon needs to pull this title (from this company) from its list. DON'T GET RIPPED OFF LIKE I DID. Pay a few extra bucks and get the pan and scan version from Legend instead (It's not the greatest, but its better than nothing. Is is possible to give a zero rating? Let this be the first!"
3,Polly Pocket Carry Case,"As Polly Pocket collectibles are numerous and small, I thought there may be some ""pockets"" inside to keep all the accessories straight. There's only some elastic bands for the dolls themselves. So while the case is a good start, there should have been some compartments inside all the clothes, shoes, etc."
2,SAVE YOUR CASH,"Pretty yes, functional slightly for sorting dolls not clothing or shoes or the other item that tag along with pollys. They really need to find a better organizational storage for these dolls small parts to market.. I really think the manufactures need to spend some time cleaning up a hugh polly collection mess to appreciate the key to organizing them. Or have the unpleasant experience of a missing shoe and tears streaming. I agree that plastic storage containers are the way to go the nice ones with the drawers in the smaller size are much more functional.ONLY good thing about this case is: for travel with a small assortment of dolls and fashions. (which you could do with a small purse.Not worth the cash."
3,I'm not thrilled!,"This is an overpriced zipper bag that can hold anything including Polly Pocket stuff. It has some cheesy elastic holder things inside that looks like it can hold up to 5 dolls to the inside ""wall"" of this bag. What this really needs is some inner pockets that can hold a lot of Polly clothes. Even better if the pockets were fat and even labeled different things like ""shoes,"" ""dresses,"" etc. Apparently this type of creativity and basic need is beyond what this zipper bag offers. Get yourself an oversized pencil container or zipper bag instead. You'll be better off."
4,Cute for holding Pollys,"I bought two for my twin nieces to hold their dolls. The quality is fairly nice, the pouch is well constructed and relatively large. My girls love it!"
2,Content not as good as pictures,"This book offers little more to the reader than a collection of full color photos of various forms of body art. It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly. The author oftens voices his opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people who use body modification to ""take things too far"". There IS a wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however, the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book, making for very little content of value. Overall, not one of the better books on the subject. Check out Bodies of Subversion by Margot Mifflin, or The Art of the Tattoo by Ferguson & Procter for better histories of tattooing, as well as any Modern Primatives issues."
1,no press cookies this year!,"I was so excited about this expensive steel cookie press. Then it arrived(on time of course).I quickly read the directions , assembled my cookie baking goodies. THEN the filled cookie press fell apart and I could not get the cookie press together again. Not one cookie was pressed.sent it back."
4,No More Pain,"I'd been using an old aluminum press for 45 years until my wrist couldn't take it anymore. This product is well constructed, easy to use and clean, and requires a gentle lever action that is much more comfortable than twisting. It is smaller so that the dough requires less effort to move through the tube. There is an adjustment that can be made if you want smaller or larger cookies. The dough also seems to release from the press onto the pan more easily than my old one. There is a handy chart of all possible cookie shapes. The shapes are more adult-oriented - no elephants, bunnies or kittiesIf you are the sort of consumer who dislikes turning pages to find the English language instructions, you might feel grumpy about having to flip back and forth between the product diagram and the instructions. I did not find that to be a problem."
2,not user friendly,This was a gift for my mother who is in her 70s. She could not press te handle hard enough to get the dough out. I tried it and I could not do it either. My husband tried and he was able to use this however with much effort. Not friendly nor easy to use at all.
1,Simply.....,"AWFUL. There are alot of wrong with this product. First and foremost, it needs a non slip grip on the barrel. Cookie didnt come out acceptable no matter how perfect my dough is (even store bought ones). The rest is jst so so"
1,"Doesn't work at all,A piece of garbage!!!!","How they can ask the price they do is outrages,it plain doesn't work....Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Will be returned to Amazon!!"
4,very pleased,"We purchased this for Christmas cookies. This press is the best we have ever had. The only downside for this press is that the provided recipe for spritz cookie dough uses weights instead of measurements. However our old Betty Crocker spritz recipe worked perfectly. When you follow the provided instructions for use, the cookies turn our very nicely. Pointers.. 1.don't use a silpat,instead apply the press directly to a greased cookie sheet. 2.The baking time for cookies will vary with the intricacy of the cookie and the size.Bill Hueckstedt"
1,Do not buy,This was extremely hard to press. The adjustment for pressure did not work and I found it difficult to use
1,Broken when I received it,It actually looked like it was made well but it did not work when I received it. I would not advance the plunger when you pulled the lever. It wasn't me it was defective. I returned it and got a refund with no problem
5,Amazing cookie press!,Every Christmas I use a cookie press to make a wonderful wreath shaped butter cookies. I don't use the press to make traditional spritz cookies. I had a press that worked very well but the star tip I used got chewed up by the disposal. I have looked for about 2 years for a replacement and actually bought 2 other presses that didn't work. I have been looking for a press ever since. This year I was asked by at least 3 people why I didn't make my wonderful wreath cookies. I explained that I didn't have a press. I went on line to find this one. Ordered it and used it as soon as it came in. This is exactly what I needed. Quality is excellent and it worked perfectly. I would highly recommend it.
3,Basic Stonewall Jackson Overview,This biography is a quick overview of Stonewall Jackson's life and is written more as a historical sequence of events rather than a revealing depiction of the man's character.
1,Forget About It........,"The first edition of this book had the face of a union cavalry man on it's cover. The author believed it was Stonewall Jackson! Weak on the outside and weak in the inside. If you really want to meet Stonewall read James Roberstson's ""Stonewall"".One star for the fun of the cover."
1,Author puts words into The General's Mouth,"I was enjoying this book until I read a note by the author stating that he had created dialogue where none was recorded. He says that he put as he would have imagined Jackson would have. I suppose he did the to move the narrative along, but in my opinion, this is inexcusable! I cannot honestly refer to anything found in these pages as fact knowing that parts are admittedly fabricated."
2,If you must have this book then buy it 1/2 price like I did.,"I found this book to be one of the more poorly written works detailing the warrior genius, Stonewall Jackson. Bowers seems confused throughout the entirity of his writing and never settles on a tone or a rhythm. The result is a book that wanders quite aimlessly at times, spouting off tidbits of information at irregular intervals."
4,Intellijams,"Although these blazed progressive jams can lack a bit of central melodic structure, this is rambling of a high order, as this very talented side project proved supreme at offering just that- a full throttle off-ramp of intelligent and intense musical quirk."
5,Gorgeous,"I don't know why some people say Madonna's voice sounds bad on this song - she sounds great! I don't know if it's literally about her life, but it comes across with sincerity."
4,"BAD GIRL IS GOOD, FEVER SIZZLES!","This is a really good song, the production could've used a little more polishing, but nonetheless worth your money. It was not really a mainstream pop hit, but if you like music about topical issues, this is for you. Lyric sample: ""Bad Girl, drunk by six. Kissing Someone Else's lips. Smoked too many cigarettes today. I'm not happy when I act this way"". The second track ""Fever"" is one of the sexiest Madonna songs ever! Even though she doesn't moan or groan through it, it even rivals ""Justify My Love"". It appears here in 4 remixes, but the album version (not on this CD) is better!"
3,Bad girl?,"Well, I love the song BAD GIRL and this cd contains many remixes of fever so I don not why it`s called bad girl. The remixes are good but I like the video version and it`s not included in the cd and that`s a shame."
4,Its ok,"I love the smell, but it seems a tad smoky when you light it up. But it smells like my favorite perfume, so I won't complain too much!"
4,"not merely a book of poetry, but a book of CLORE","If, like me, you've had some problems with poetry, then this book may suit you well. Whether Phil Clore has developed his own format, I don't know [ poetry is usually not my thing: I've known Phil for a dozen years, I'm usually interested in what he has to say, so I bought the book]. I do know that his style is crisp, economically powerful, vibrant. I imagine someday, in a moment of fame by association, I'll puff up: "" Phil Clore: know him well. Powerful writer !!"""
4,A Psychedelic Mass? You Betcha!,"I bought this album, in a bargain bin many moons ago for only 50 cents. I didn't fully appreciate it back then. Since getting back into the Electric Prunes again, I've rediscovered this fantastic concept album. The guitar playing is awsome. It's very, very trippy indeed. If you love the Prunes, you MUST own this CD! Once you get it, darken the room, light some candles and incense, and enjoy the trip!!!"
4,Electric Prunes - 'Mass In F Minor' (Collector's Choice),"There are a couple of stories floating around out there of how this lp actually came to be.Most who tell it probably don't even know that much about the Prunes anyway.I've ALWAYS been a fan of this group.As best I could tell,after the band already had their first two lp's 'I Had To Much To Dream' and 'Underground' out,their record company and producer/composer David Axelrod had apparently 86'd all five members of the Electric Prunes and bought in five NEW replacements.In my opinion,a TOTAL cheat to EVERYONE.However,I cannot deny that 'Mass In F Minor' is a damn fine psych lp at that.Axelrod's idea of doing a psychedelic version of a Catholic mass REALLY seemed to have worked.Best tracks would be ""Kyrie Eleison"",""Gloria""(not like the Them/Van Morrison song) and the two bonus cuts,""Hey Mr.President"" and ""Flowing Smoothly"".If you ask me,the five original members SHOULD recieve royalties from this worthy reissue if they don't already."
2,Who remastered this?,"With all due respect to the previous reviewer, I must say that the remastering on this CD is appallingly bad. That's because I have heard the previous CD of this album, which was on the German Line label. This CD sounds like a Dolby-encoded tape being played back without being decoded, except not as bright sounding. There's lots of hiss, though, and the sound is very compressed. No, somebody goofed with this one, folks. The definitive version of ""Mass In F Minor"" has yet to be released. But if you can find the now-deleted Line CD, buy it instead. Even with its flaws, it's still better than the latest version."
2,Not a totally original idea.....,"The ""mass"" album concept was actually done first (and better) by an Italian band called I Barritas in 1966. Although the song titles are very similar, the music is totally different. I Barritas ""La Messa Dei Giovani"" is a great psych pop beat album and is worth searching out. I'd skip this one and try something more consistent by the Prunes."
2,Indulgent pap,"This is not the Electric Prunes. This is David Axelrod's project and it reeks of late 60s navel-gazing and self-indulgence. Revisionism currently has lent his name a certain vogue, but it's of the trash culture variety i.e. ""so pompous, it's good."" One would be better served getting the Electric Prunes definitive compilation ""Lost Dreams,"" which has tracks personally selected and remixed by lead singer James Lowe. Take note, that he doesn't include a single Axelrod track on said album. There's a reason for that; the band despised Axelrod's involvement on ""Mass In F Minor."""
1,HORRIBLE!,Absolutely horrible to the ears and soul of any true Catholic. This album is NOT Catholic.
4,I/ve Never Heard Anything Quite Like This Before.,"Many years ago I heard the first track, Kyrie Eleison, on the Easy Rider film soundtrack and I liked it, however my Latin knowledge was/is nil, now I find from this CD insert it means, ""Lord have mercy upon us"".My 1990 copy of Mass In F Minor contains the 6 original songs, all are sung in Latin, helpfully they do have printed English translations.The sounds are truely of the late 1960s with phased guitars to the fore.Overall it has reverence for those of the Christian faith, just in a different setting.At 26 minutes it's the shortess CD I own, but well worth hearing."
3,It's NOT that bad,"I would have given ""Mass in F minor"" a 3 1/2 star rating, but I'll have to settle for 3.The Electric Prunes are probably best none for their sex and acid drenched psych anthems ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" and ""Get Me To The World on Time"" so a Roman Catholic mass wasn't exactly predictible. Maybe they thought the Latin chants and organs were creepy and mysterious, maybe they actually dig church...who knows? Either way, it's not a terribly original concept as one reviewer pointed out.Still, dispite the fact that I found the concept rather laughable, I gave it a good listen and HEY! It's not bad at all! Actually, it's pretty good. Dated? Maybe. Cheesy? Absolutely. Lava lamp listening? You betcha"
5,A Big Surprise,"Was I amazed. Amazing material. Amazing feel. Warm and not hot. Had bad chest cold. This turtle neck got me through. Also, easy to wash by hand hang up and it is dry the next day....."
5,Yes,"I have been looking for good turtleneck for some time. This was exactly what else looking for. Very comfortable, nice material, it fits well. The price was correct. I recommend this product anyone looking for a good turtleneck."
5,excellent,"excellent material, fine stitching and wonderful looks. am very happy. thanks. The texture is so nice it beats all expectations."
2,Cliche and stilted,"I'm not sure what all the praise is for the beautiful writing. I see no beautiful writing here. I see a stilted story that captures every dumb cliche of melodramatic fantasy. I bought this book for the same reason that were previously stated, but was very disappointed by the silly characters and the ridiculous nomenclature--The One Who Comes, Mindpower, Handpower--puh---lease! Ms. Strauss, this sounds like a bad B SF movie."
4,"Fantastic world, Plot shifts & twists keep you glued","A story developing a real and different complex world - Maybe the best I've come across since Darkover. The 'Magic' of the mind powers are rooted in the physical and the socio economic facts fit with the realities of the situation as developed.I could not put the book down and when finished, picked it right back up to read through again for all the subtext I had raced past the first time. It held up well to that second reading."
4,"Not a fantasy fan, but . . .","What drew me into this book was the characters and the excellent writing. The fantasy elements don't overwhelm the exploration of personal development, which is what I generally focus on. I would have liked to see more about the ""missing years,"" but since Bron's path was well set and the author made it clear what his goal was going to be, it was probably a wise decision not to make the book unnecessarily long.It was good enough to make me buy the sequel, which I also enjoyed."
4,Ignore the Back and Read This,"Strauss' The Arm of the Stone starts off a little rocky. I had a difficult time trying to figure out who all of characters were -- most had so little character. And the back of the book was rather lame -- the sort of writing that I despise (see the ""product description."")But I was glad that I kept reading. The characters I couldn't follow smoothed out or left and she set the stage for a brilliant piece of fiction that relates to many facets of life and religion.Strauss keeps you reading by laying out the story with perfect clarity. You know how it's going to turn out. And then she adds a new layer that changes your perceptions on everything. And she keeps that process up all the way through the end.If you are to read only one book this year, don't read this one. But if you like to read and you love unique writing with fresh twists, then pick this up."
2,"An enjoyable airplane book that tries, but alas, falls short","I picked this book up shortly before boarding a trans-US flight, not expecting much except that it would help pass the 5+ hours trapped in coach. Suffice it to say that I wasn't disappointed, but neither was I especially enthralled. Ms. Strauss has created an interesting world, with some innovative ideas, but never really goes anywhere with it. I, personally, did not find the characters all that interesting, nor did I notice any development, despite the fact that the story takes place over the span of several years. In the end, this was just another, decent fantasy work. A good way to pass the time, but not something worth reading twice."
4,A book that stands above the crowd,"As a writer of fantasy myself, I was very impressed with this book. It eschews the cliches of elves and dragons and instead delivers a fully realized world, very different from most found on the shelves. Ms. Strauss is a very fine writer with an eye and ear for detail. I highly recommend this novel."
3,Wordy but enjoyable,"The prose in Arm of the Stone is very, very dense. Paragraphs are long, and everything is somewhat exhaustively described - this is one of the books only real failings, and I admit that I skipped any number of paragraphs and don't feel that I missed out on actual 'story.'Because of the density of description, the story itself is fairly slow, but it often skips over intervening years so we get a nice epic-feeling plot arc. The characters are well-written, especially the two main protagonists, and the world is both inventive and pleasingly complex, with our understanding of its depth growing as the characters do.All in all, a pleasing read."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm sorry for the money I spent, don't let it happen to you... This book is the worst I've seen on the book market. Low quality and zero valuable information. About 100 pages showing big bad grandmaster either doing miracles or explaning basic martial arts terms. I think I will substitute ...this book!"
1,How NOT to prepare martial arts instruction,"This work is disappointing in every category. It is poorly organized; text and photos are mismatched and incomplete. The production quality is really terrible; everyone in the photos is wearing black, the camera is 20 feet back, and the halftone screens in the photos are extremely coarse making it impossible to see any detail. The text descriptions of the katas are disorganized and inadequate; filled with grammatical errors and mispellings. The katas themselves are preposterous set-ups showing Prof. Soto overwhelming 3 and 4 pistol wielding attackers at once. A great deal of content is dedicated to Prof. Soto's celebrity shots. For the asking price, one might expect more than this thin paperback provides. I am not sure what Prof. Soto set out to accomplish in this book other than a sideshow of self aggandizement."
1,truly awful,"The main problem with martial arts?: People trying to teach things that they are not qualified to teach. This book falls squarely into that subject. Soto has no real background in any martial arts so he isn't qualified to teach some new ""style"" that he created. Book is worse then other reviewers have stated. It is so bad that I am not trading it in at the used book style but rather I am shredding it so that it can be recycled as something else. Waste of paper and time"
5,Creepy Ants,This item was purchased as part of a Halloween costume and not as a toy to play with so it was exactly what I wanted.
3,ants...,"I bought these as a guessing game for my daughters picnic themed 2nd birthday party. It worked out great. You cant expect too much, they are just little rubbery ants. Overall they served their purpose."
4,Very good lots of information!,Very good! Lots of stories and information on various concentrtion camps including: aushwitz and chelmno. I highly recommend you watch this.
2,riddled with errors,This book is really hard to follow for people with any experiance in electronics and math.I worked through the first end of chapter test and found 6 out of the 25 answers in the theback to be wrong. Then as I was reading through the second chapter the author kept using theequal sign in the formulals showing two things equal that were not. I was really dissapointedbecause the layout of the book looks really clean and straight forward.
1,Was there a technical editor?,"Upon first sight it appeared to be a solid text, but after getting past the first several pages there were enough typos, inaccurate calculations and blatantly wrong information that I promptly returned the book to its seller. I cannot recommend this text for anyone that will actually rely upon it for solid information."
2,Needs work,"Do not employ this book as your primary reference tool for the subject of electrician's math -- doing so will only lead to frustration as you struggle aimlessly to determine why your answer does not match that in the book. Not all of the answers are incorrect, most are right on target. However, there are enough typos and mathematical calculation errors within to cause the sanest reader to ask in befuddlement, ""where did that come from?""My suggestion: do not buy this book until the revised version is available; or, if you're like me, and can't or won't wait, find another more accurate text."
5,Very impressed,"A very good manual to keep on the jobsite. Quick and easy to find calculations within, a must have for every electrician, wether a JIT, Journeyman, or Master. I was very impressed with the manual for the money. Now I have everyone at work asking to borrow it."
3,HIGH SCHOOL NERD!,"When Sam leaps into Cameron, a hotrod jock who loves junk-food, (and has the zits to prove it) He must rescue Cam's sister from a horrible relationship! But who will listen to him?! Not One of the Best Quantum Leaps, although pretty good!"
3,A Note on the Ingredients,"While I generally like the ingredients in most of All Terrain natural products, buyers should be aware that this product contains the following active ingredients: Octinoxate 7.0%, Octisalate 4.5%, Zinc Oxide 4.5%, Oxybenzone 3.5%.Personally I didn't like the texture of this lipblock but I am reasonably sure with all those active ingredients it is a solid sun protector."
5,Best By Far! Lip Armor far exceeds any other lip protection I've ever used. It actually heals cracked chapped lips.,I live in Phoenix. The weather is extremely hot and dry. Lip Armor works. It's as simple as that. You can feel the relief immediately and it keeps on working. I originally purchased Lip Armor in California after spending the day in the sun and wind out on the water. It would also be great for skiiing. It is perfect for anyone who gets chapped lips. It's a great product and there aren't many products of any type I'd say that about. Give it a try. You won't regret it.
4,Unlocking the Chains of Materialism,"How do you motivate greedy, self-seeking, materialistic Americans to grasp the idea of charitable giving? That is the task that Randy Alcorn takes on in this book. Although, it is not an easy assignment, I found this book to do an excellent job of laying it out in an easy to follow and interesting way.Narrowing the subject down to 6 core principles from Scripture, Alcorn leads the reader through a journey of unfolding understanding of the role of money in the life of the Christ follower. The book concludes with a challenge to sign that has the potential to transform the financial outlook of anyone who will take it on.By sharing his own personal story of financial setback and how that set the stage for him to be more generous than ever with his money, especially his book royalties, Alcorn gives credibility to the principles that he teaches. Anyone who really desires to break the mold of American materialistic living needs to read this book."
4,"Too short, wanted it to keep going.","Randy Alcorn's book has been around for a while. I have finally gotten around to reading it. I should have read this book long ago. It's brief, powerful, and will change the way you look at generosity. Alcorn encourages his readers to give and give and give. Give and see how blessed you are. Give and see what a difference it makes in your life. I would encourage anyone who is a fan of Dave Ramsey or Crown Financial to check this book out. Obviously at 120 pages it can't replace the power of a financial class, but it can give you a boost, when you begin to second-guess yourself. Highly recommended.I received this book for free from Multnomah in exchange for an honest review."
4,A Worthy Investment,"It's easy to see why there have been over 1 million copies sold, of The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn. This book looks at financial giving to God from every biblical angle.It would be hard for any believer to read and walk away unchanged, therefore, I highly recommend it to every follower of Christ.The author uses scripture first to take away every excuse we have ever conjured up regarding our financial giving to God, but then he also successfully puts giving in the correct light of worship, stewardship, heavenly reward, and true joy.This book is not about laying a legalistic burden on people, or using guilt to motivate Christians to give to their church.It is clearly presented that the person who benefits most from giving, in this life and in the life to come, is the giver.Short and well-written, The Treasure Principle is an easy read that could change your life. Well worth the investment.The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving (LifeChange Books)"
5,The Heart of the Matter,"Great book on what we should value the most in life. It's not what we have here on earth that counts with God, but what we do with what we have that counts. Randy Alcorn describes what matters most to God in a wonderful, clear way."
5,A broad set of musical skills well displayed.,"I disgree with the review of Derek Taylor only in that I think Rev. Gary Davis is the best blues 12 string guitarist ever. What is most impressive about Blind Connie Williams is the range of his vocals - from a soaring lyrical voice to a deep-blues gravelly growl to a ""typical"" black voice. I use the term ""black"" with the intent to convey the quarter-tone and glides. Add to this remarkable voice a guitar or an accordian and you get this remarkable album. Yes, I said accordian - this is the only accordian blues/folk/spiritual album I've heard where the accordian was exactly the right instrument for the song.His rendition of Will the Circle Be Unbroken makes the ""old chestnut"" come alive ... no bad tracks. If you have any interest in street blues, spirituals, folk, give this CD a listen."
3,"Fun, but foam is flimsy",We got each of my boys a set for Christmas and they love them. Our one complaint is that the foam easily ripped.
5,Eagles kids helmets,My grandsons are huge Eagles fans and were thrilled to receive these helmets and shirts. They wear them every time they watch football on tv.
2,Where's the pads?????,"I don't know if you were supposed to get pads or not,because I never received any. The helmet is great though, and the jersey ifits perfectly , but i will grow out of it in a month. Overall its great but again where's the pads??????????????????"
3,Eagles Fan,We purchased this for our seven year old grandson for Christmas. He was so excited and wore it most of the day. He needed help getting the strap snapped on the helmet because it works too hard for him to do it himself. The shirt was too small and he is average sized for his age...the reason I can't rate it any higher.
4,This book is facinating!!,"Jess is going away, but not without knowing all the familys ghost stories, love stories, and secrets. This is a book of the secrets that are hidden in her family's history... What will be revealed? This book is unputdownable! Read it...NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,B.B. swings!,"Great swingin' blues from B. B. King and and eighteen-piece orchestra. Starts off with a swing version of the U2/B.B. King song ""When Love Comes To Town."" Other good cuts, The Thrill Is Gone, Payin' The Cost..., Ain't Nobody's Business. My only complaint is that it's over too soon! Itruns a standard 45 mintues, but every time I play it, it's like it's over before it should be!Good stuff, check it out."
5,Live at the Applo,the Title tells you all you need to know first time i heard this it was on Wax i have been dragging a copy of it around from then on
3,It's okay,"The weight is on one side so the ball is lopsided. It works well for some things and not for others. But all in all, for the price, it is a decent product."
4,Best there is,"This is a useful accompaniment to any trip to Beirut, and at the moment is about the only guidebook available. American embassy staff commend it. Be forewarned, however, that my one attempt to use the maps led to a memorable adventure with a series of Beirut cab drivers, one of whom did eventually find Centrale, the restaurant I sought, but no thanks to the book."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great",It was pretty good. Dealt with everyday life of Rome instead of the history of Rome. Had some interesting facts. Fast read.
5,Man Oh Man! Great Listening! Chicago Blues Unplugged!,"This is an unusual CD. Chicago Blues, in common parlance, is electric music, played in smoky nightclubs. This CD visits individual legendary Chicago Blues artists and records them at home, in the living room or kitchen, solo. There are some beautiful performances here. The relaxed setting does several of these artists great justice. They can stretch out and play what they feel. As you listen, you feel like you are right there with the artists making the music.Great listening, highly recommended."
5,UNBELIEVABLE concert....,"This is a FABULOUS concert! I wasn't sure how Train and Martina could really 'combine', but my husband and I sat there entranced! If you are a fan of one or both, you need to see this. Wish it had been provided in BluRay, but it's great anyway. There are some parts that are talking with the 2 stars, but it's not as intrusive as some shows I've seen. You still get the 'feel' of the concert. Recommended."
5,Great video!!,"I for happened to catch this twosome on CMT Cross Roads, it was a fabulous pairing of voices. I recorded the program and found myself watching it over and over, but didn't have a full recording of the songs. When I found that this was available, I bough it in a heartbeat & have been enjoying it & sharing it ever since."
3,CMT Crossroads,"Martina McBride is great,Train gets tiring to watch prance across the set. Martina blows him away, with her great voice."
1,THE MAGIC YEARS,Although this book was referred to us by our pediatrician I found it very difficult to actually get through. It rambles on and on not....not an easy read which makes it hard to ascertain any information.I would not recommend this book.
4,old advice can be the best,"this book is not new but the information it contains is more valuable each year... in these days of day care and nannies, this keeps your eye on the prize..."
3,Limited use with citrus.,"As noted earlier, this is really limited to lemons and limes.Try the Orangex mid to large sized commercial model , if you want to juice oranges and small grapefruit easily. It's heavy enough to do the job, and it cleans up easily.In buying a juicer, definitely get a ""center pull"" handle, rather than an off center handle model, else you'll be wrestling it to keep it from tilting over to the side that it's handle is upon."
1,broke within a day!,cheaply made - the handle broke the first time that I used it! The bottom cup doesn't line up easily with the pressing cone - making it break off easily. Wish I'd sent it back.
3,Pretty good,"It does what it is supposed to. It is fairly well made and is reasonably priced. There is nothing wrong with it, nor anything exceptional about."
1,item damaged,This item was damaged. I contacted the seller and they promised to send a pickup and credit my account. That was over a month ago. I have been very disappointed.
5,A great starter.....,"Man! Three full disc of great sounds from Loren Connors!This is a nice place to start for the beginner,because this set has many examples of this ""venusian blues"" guitarists craft.There are his lilting ,fragile pieces,and some of his more trditional sounds too (a few are even a bit loud). Occasional vocals are here too,...some by Susan,Loren's wife(in his Haunted House version of his vision).I was so used to his album releases that seem to average only 30-some minutes playing time each,that when I started to listen here I found I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer size of this portion of Mr. Connors' music found here. But it's all of high quality,and most of it is dreamy,floating ,forelorn blues-y stuff.Well worth the price,and (like I said before) a fine starter kit as an intorduction to this sigular artist's sound. This could be the one Loren MazzaCane Connors CD set you need in your collection,or the beginning of an obsession with his music.Give it a try and see for yourself."
3,Elementary Article,"This is a very elementary article on EVM and is useful primarily to see a high level overview of what OMB A-11 says about how EVM should be incorporated into the Federal government report OMB-300.The article refers to what seems to be a critical figure, but the figure is missing."
3,Wierd,"I saw this film last night on TCM. Silent movies are very odd. Douglas Fairbanks is impressive in his acrobatics and swordplay but does not look like Don Diego, who is said to be handsome in the original story. It is the basic traditional Zorro story, based directly on the original novel by Johnston McCulley. For my first silent movie, it was OK, but without sound it is hard to follow. All the original characters are here, all not as attractive as their parts suggest. The remake starring Tyrone Power is much more impressive."
4,Remarkably Good!,"When you consider how old this program is and that it is silent, you really appreciate the wonderful film. Even though he was getting on a bit in year the stunts performed by Douglas Fairbanks were outstanding!"
5,A true gem....,"As a kid in the 50's I saw several reruns of the old silent shorts but never a movie. I have to say I found this truly entertaining. The music was perfectly chosen and added to the charm of the movie. Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. was amazing with all the action parts. That man certainly was athletic to say the least. Having enjoyed this so much, I will have to check out some of the other old silent movies."
2,Bad Release,Whoever said that music was not instrumental in movies should see this version of the Mark of Zorro. I originally saw this movie from the film in the library and it was amazing with the music score - then I bought this version which has a different score and it is horrible and boring.
3,"""have you seen this one?""","Without the mask, he takes on an annoying personality...""have you seen this one?"". No wonder his gal pal found him unappealing when driven up special in a carriage by her parents to be courted by him. Maybe that's why a guy in a mask is so appealing in the first place, anyone would do after the annoying guy with the hanky. Zorro is very athletic and does some amazing moves. I don't know if that was a stunt double or the actor but those leaps and jumps were impressive"
2,Bad Product or Defective Unit,"I bought this scale, in part relying on the German stereotype of precision and quality (Soehnle is a German firm), and was dissapointed in both regards. The item came with batteries that leaked and damaged the screen slightly. The weight (of me) that the unit gave was off by more than 50lb (relative to conventional scales). It is of course possible that this particular unit that I purchased was defective and that others would work fine."
1,VERY Inaccurate,"I purchased this scale 6 months ago and am VERY disappointed. Weight readings are extremely inaccurate. I am not sure if the rest (fat and water %) are accurate or not.I can step on and off the scale a dozen times and get different readings every time. And NONE of them match the other scale in my house, or my Dr's scale."
3,5 cd changer required,"Andrea Parker certainly has mutiple interests regarding music, ranging from breakbeats to house to trip hop, but you wouldn't know it from this album. The beat stays within the same range for all the songs so there's a monochromatic feel to this album even though she mixes everyone from Dr. Octagon to Dj Panic to Depeche Mode. The cd is quite good to chill out to, just make sure you have another disc in your player."
3,"Good book, but predictable ending.","I enjoyed reading this book, but early on I knew the ending. So once I got to the end I wasn't shocked, but I liked the way the author handled it. Robyn was a good character and she knew her stuff. If you're into the Zodiac aspect, this book is for you."
5,The ultimate wah pedal,"This pedal has about as much variability as you can get. It is well constructed and I love all the tone options I get, and I really love the boost! My only complaint is I wish it had a status LED!"
5,Receiving book order,"I had ordered 60 of these books. To date, I have received 13 and they are coming one at a time. I would like to know when we can expect to received the remainder of these.ThanksPattiSouthwest Human DevelopmentPhoenix, AZPhone: 602-218-8673"
5,Beauty and Darkness..the most powerful art I have ever seen,"I was anxiously awaiting this title....after purchasing John's first book several years ago...I have hungered for more. This book exceeds my highest expectations!!! John Santerineross has the amazing ability to capture beauty and darkness simultaneously to create images that invoke an emotional response. I am amazed beyond words at the power in his images! I was mesmerized by each image, each detail...every part is hauntingly beautiful.This book is a MUST HAVE!"
5,Excellent!,"A beautiful book, collectible. I really enjoyed every page of the fine printed works of John Santerineross one of my favorites photographers and symbolist."
5,Dream is visionary.,"Dream is visionary, every time you look at a photo, you will see something new. Each photo transcends the emotion of the artist, and draws you into a world beyond. Depth, movement, mood, everything in this book is amazing. Be prepared to have your breath taken away by Dream."
3,inventory,Inventory is very difficult to use in quickbooks... i would only recommend QB if you do not have inventory to track. For small businesses or simple checking needs this should work.
1,Skippy Peanut Butter,"I ordered Skippy Natural Peanut Butter, Amazon shipped the soybean oil crap. I don't eat soybean anything, threw it in the trash, pissed me off. Amazon won't let me give it zero stars, but that's what I would rate any soy product."
1,"Unilever, which makes this product, has to be kidding!","I bought two jars of this Skippy (creamy) peanut butter, because Costco is not currently selling Adams natural peanut butter (no sugar or other oils) or Kirkland organic or natural peanut butter.Some young kids may like this product but it is NOT real peanut butter. The other additives, including sugar, totally reduce the real peanut flavor, and basically ruin the product. I think I'm going to return the two jars to Costco and get my money back!In my opinion it is a big mistake to buy this (or any other) peanut butter that is made using added sugars and other oils...no one who knows what real peanut butter tastes like, would buy Skippy peanut butter. The best peanut butter is made from organic valencia peanuts, but unfortunately most all of these peanuts are grown in New Mexico, in an area where the packager has had problems with E. coli contamination."
5,Great deal and taste!,"Fantastic deal, taste and packaging. Highly suggest purchasing this if you go through peanut butter quickly!We loved the taste and the freshness."
3,Disappointing,"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was released in 2001.When I watched that video game movie, I could not believe how realistic it was.There is no salvation for T4 or this game. They are both mundane & trite.They took no time to doctor up this movie. The chapters are short. The video is grainy & flawed, just like a video game, only not as engaging.You would have to be a machine to enjoy this movie.:(FF is still on my shelf. Salvation is going bye bye ..."
1,This the worst thing to buy.,"If you played Terminator on X-Box or PS3 then you know have bad the game was. If you see how bad the graphics are then that is what the whole DVD is, just no bad graphic video game episodes. Do not get this. I wish that there was star 0 because that is what I would rate thus."
2,Seriously?,"I just paid $3 for a 12 minute advertisement for a video game. Lame. I would have liked to know it was only 12 minutes. Video quality was OK, I could tell it was a game engine pretty early one when the characters where running. Story line was interesting and it might have been worth it for even a 30 minute episode. I would have preferred an hour. You can normally download 90-120 movies for $3, so I feel a bit ripped off."
2,Short..,"For those of you who don't know ""Machinima"" is a movie made with a game engine. In this case Terminator Salvation, however as interesting as this can be this story episode is way too short. It would have been suited for a thirty minute shot rather than twelve. I may have been happier paying 99 for this episode. I've seen better Half-Life 2 Machinima for free on the net."
3,Nothing Special...,"The main item that lacks here is the animation. Normally not a bit deal for me, but when you have artwork from the video game cracking from the creation in a lower resolution universe, it starts to get annoying.The story is fine, relatively simplistic, stretched out a bit... much of this is action, unfortunately you loose interest early on."
2,Fan of the Terminator movies,"Honestly, when it came to the idea of Terminator animation, I thought ""This should be good"". Wow, was I wrong. The graphics are pretty lame and the story is rather lackluster."
3,Terminator Diehards Only,"I liked it, but I am a nut for Terminator. It is a very short choppy animated film that does not have high detail in the environment. I believe the main focus on this series was to focus on the plot and not on the quality of film. With that said, if you really like Terminator and want to see another story line, I believe you will like it. Not love it, but it is okay. I give it 3 stars because for me that is what it is."
3,"Good Story, Bad animation","This was a mixed bag....on one hand it had a great story explaining a part of the Terminator Salvation story. On the other hand the animation was very poor and distracting. It was made using video game engines so it very much has the feel of cut scenes from a video game but with that said, they could have polished it alot. Some of the angles were very odd and hard to tell what was going on and the PQ was extremely blurry and poor. The bigges thing I kept noticing was that everyones teeth looked like a Jack O' Lanterns!I did enjoy it overall quite a bit but the animation just seemed rushed and could have benefited from some more work..."
3,please what a rip off the story is good tho,"what I bought this ? First off ep 1.2.3.4. should have been one episode for $5.00 ..Don't get me wrong I liked it I bought it now I have to clip them all together so I can watch them all at once ,if this animation is done this way again ,I will wait for the whole season to go to DVD"
4,prequel to Terminator Salvation,"I was skeptical at first of animation made with video game technology, but I quickly forgot this while watching and enjoyed the story. There are interesting programmer-hacker themes that are mentioned, such as the importance of attacking Skynet's communications network, and not just its robot drones. Despite the constant firefights and gun battles, Machinima still manages to seem like an intelligent sci-fi art film. In fact not one character says anything cheesy like ""Come with me if you want to live"" or ""I'll be back."""
2,Below Par,Originally saw this at BestBuy but it had a $9.99 price tag so I bought it at Amazon because it was a lot cheaper and I wasn't in a hurry. Good effort for the crew that made this dvd but they wasted the talent of Moon Bloodgood for such an inferior movie. They had the right idea but the technical crew messed it all up. The animation looks highly unpolished and the dialogue is cheesy and repetitive. You will notice even the mouth movements were not synchronized with the lines. I ended up fast forwarding the dvd 70% of the time just to get closure and somehow get my money's worth.I love animated movies but this one is probably lightyears behind what our current technology has to offer. I thought this was going to be similar to Appleseed Ex-machina but I was mistaken. Appleseed Ex-machina should probably be treated as the model for this kind of animation although the process in making then I think is somewhat different.
3,Good enough for your Terminator fix,"I am still mad about them canceling Sarah Conner Chronicles. Its one of the few TV series that I really, really wanted to know what was going to happen next. The people who cancelled that series should be a;lsdk kdfjklFII!!! (its too bad for a Amazon review).Ok, so, if you haven't seen that series watch it. The second season is even better than the first.This video is animated and has graphics about the level of todays consoles (PS3/Xbox), but don't let that stop you. Its pretty good and lets cross our fingers that if the Terminator mythology is persistant enough we may see some more great content."
5,Unforgettable,"""Pure Schuur"" is the first cd of Diane's I came in contact with, and while, yes, a few of the tracks are a bit drab... but that comes with every record. ""You Don't Remember Me"" is what drew me into the sounds of Diane Schuur. It is a moving piece as well as the several of my favorites that are on this cd. For any of us who made it into Jazz Choir/Ensemble back in school, this is worth listening to."
4,She's Good.,"I heard Diane Schuur in concert with Maynard Ferguson tonight, and I'm awfully glad I did. I knew she would be stunning in person, as is Maynard, and the combination truly works.I've had this CD for years, so of course I had to pop it in for another listen. My favorite is All Caught Up in Love. Sometimes I used to think she sometimes overdoes it, but not anymore. When you've got a gift like hers you may as well use it. I love her voice and how she uses it."
2,Combination of smooth jazz/schmaltz,"The CD features primarily smooth jazz or schmaltzy arrangements. Not too much actually grips the listener or is passionate. To overcompensate for this, Dianne tends to oversing shrilly on a few numbers, hitting high notes for the sake of hitting high notes, rather than for the sake of the song. There are much better albums of hers out there. As another reviewer notes, there are a couple of good cuts. My favorite is where she swings the blues with Joe Williams in a big band setting on ""Deed I Do"", which is a lot of fun. But when I want to listen to Dianne, I'll be reaching for one of the jazzier or more soulful albums she has recorded."
2,Not Pure Schuur,"Very simply put, Diane Schuur is too talented a singer and has too good a voice for it to be covered over by the needlessly overdone orchestration that is found on several of this CD's tracks. That said, there are a few choice pieces here. They surface when the orchestration supports instead of competes with her voice as on Unforgettable and I Could Get Used To This. Schuur also shines when there are only a few instruments accompanying her as on You Don't Remember Me and We Can Only Try."
2,not for the age range it states,"My son received this for his 4th birthday and enjoyed it that day, and maybe once since then. The games are too easy and he got bored quickly even though he has never played anything like it before. I would not recommend for any age because my 2 year old just can't quite do the controls and understand game and it is too simple for a 4 year old. Maybe a 3 year old would enjoy?"
2,Not challenging enough,"My five year old got this for Christmas and he was bored within an hour. He loves Rescue Heroes and so we thought this was a great gift, but the missions were so easy that he had no challenge. Our 2 1/2 year old picked up the controls and could play the game with a little challenge, but that is probably about the age level this game would provide a challenge to, not to 5 year old or older."
2,Not as Good as the Natural Filters. They Break.,"So far I've had four of these break on me leaving the coffee full of grounds. I never had this problem with the natural filters. I bought these thinking that the ""paper"" smell of the natural filters would be reduced. It is but it's not worth the wasted coffee. Very disappointed and I have a bunch of them to use up."
1,False and Misleading Listing,"Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds???"
5,Hard to find #6 Mellita Coffee Filters,"I have used the #6 Mellita filter to make our daily drip coffee for the last 10 or 12 years because it makes a fresh, perfectly brewed carafe of coffee. For some unknown reason the 2 major grocery chains in my area, which used to stock Mellita #6 coffee filters most of the time, no longer have them. I had no idea that Amazon sold such items and was thrilled to find a place where I could purchase them"
5,FANTASTIC...!,"This absolutely is the best textbook on the market for preparing to teach preschool children. The quality of the book reflects the author's intense dedication to early childhood as a teacher, center director, and University professor.The book takes a much needed ""how to"" approach and is written in a clear and concise style. Beginning with understanding the characteristics of young children at different ages, the book is comprehensive. It includes everything you need to know to set up a creative developmentally appropriate environment; manage a classroom; plan an inviting curriculum, work with parents, etc. The hundreds of colored photographs help the reader see and understand quality indicators needed in outstanding early childhood programs. Treat yourself and order it today!"
4,Dosage Information -- 33% RDA,"The product data as of the time I write this doesn't include the dosage information. Here's the amount per tablet and percent of recommended daily value:Calcium, 333 mg, 33%Magnesium, 133 mg, 33%Zinc, 5 mg, 33%"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"This book is both inspiring and practical. Many, many wonderful pictures to look at for inspiration and patterns for creating your own! I have already dog eared my pages!!"
1,not pleased,"This was not at all what I expected and in some cases a little creepy. The idea of creating paper doll images by using different items such as photos,magazine cutouts,newspaper clips,feathers, etc. seemed like fun - but then he gets into jointed paper dolls that look more like marionettes with limbs way out of proportion, using exotic bird heads on top of female bodies, sad and angry childrens photo faces on magazine bodies and finally let's not forget the skeletons 'dressed up' in clothes and the 'ever so mirthful' shrine dolls. Some of the book is good and I'm sure the artists showcased are well respected in their fields.. but I'm involved with this type of collage art to create 'happy' or 'contemplative'designs - not stuff that makes me wince when I see it"
2,Don't waste your money,"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. The items are small, smaller than they appear in the picture. I only paid $30, but I would not purchase it again. On the positive side, the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible."
3,So and so as all his CD's.,"I know Ravel personally, he's a wonderful guy. Some of his music is good and some are okay. El Pepino is fast paced which is what he needs to do more often cause right now dominicanos like me like fast merengue, but Ravel is always good and delivers at times."
3,"Folky, and trying to find a groove","Grace and group are a little tentative on this production. They seem to be searching for their voice, something they will find on the later CD. One gets a ray of hope for this group's full-tilt power, but the sun's behind the clouds much of the time. A song or two are disturbingly derivative---evidence ""Treat Me Right"", whose tune makes the listener think it's a cover for Little Feat's version of ""On Your Way Down.""That's not to say that there aren't some pleasant cuts on this album and a few outstanding pieces of work. Grace's voice cuts loose and the potential of the band is on display on ""Some Kind of Ride"", ""Sweet Hands"", and especially the two versions of the title song. The CD is slightly less expensive than most and that title cut alone is almost worth the price...almost."
4,"Great band, great singer! Bad Master!","This band is great Grace is the whole package. The problem I have is the CD itself, the Master Copy is not good. There is alot of noise and garble at times.I bought my original autographed copy at a live show, Grace and the band autographed it on the spot. When I got it home and listen to it I had damaged the CD, so I bought a new one. The new one has the same noise.Whom ever mastered this CD did a pooor job.I have other CD's from theis band abd they are of good quality."
5,A Great VT Band!!!,"This is a band from my home state of Vermont. It is an awesome CD. It is an awesome combination of soul, blues, folk, and rock. Grace has an awesome voice and if you ever get the chance to see them live it is a concert you will not forget. They are one of those bands that sound amazing on CD and even better live. There is a lot of energy on this CD and the lyrics are different from what you might hear from most bands consisting of people in their low 20's...they really are some profound words. Definately an EXCELLENT BUY!!!"
4,One of the best new groups,"Simple lyrics, good music, Grace sounds good while playing her B3. Just ordered their latest release. Grace does sound like Bonnie Raitt. Grace turned Nashville upside down 2 weeks ago during the country music show."
3,so-so roots rock,"I agree with the reviewer below. The band is not, overall, very good. In particular the guitar playing is very weak. Potter herself has a turn of phrase and plays passable B3 organ, but if you want the cutting edge of this sort of music, look to Tift Merritt."
1,Poor quality CD set,"I bought this cd as a christmas gift. a 2 cd set, the second cd was unreadable by 5 different players."
3,A bit too safe for my taste,"Mike S. nailed it good when he compared this album to Bonnie Raitt's oeuvre, and especially I should add the 'Nick Of Time' LP. However nice is the playing and good is the voice, I think Ms Potter & Co. remain far too much inside their comfort zone. The end result is a rather well-intended, reverential and formulaic blues-rock. In their first few LPs (The White StripesandWhite Blood Cells), The White Stripes gave a good kick to the way the blues was then played. Even Joss Stone, in her first LP (Soul Sessions), had a more interesting take on ol' time soul music than what G. Potter achieved here. That said I don't have any doubt this band is a good night out whenever they're playing live."
5,Crazy good,This album is a rockin' good time. This woman can sing and her band is tight and musical. I love this album!
1,Stay away from this product,"Stay away from this product, it has a strange substance, not enjoyable at all, and the worst is the fragrance, quite nauseating, gave me a headache. I've tried a number of facial moisturizers and this got to be the worst !"
3,Not outstanding,"OK, this book has received prizes and stellar reviews here and elsewhere but personally I didn't like it very much. First, the text and the exercises lack mathematical depth. There are entire chapters, such as the one on AES, which add hardly anything to the official standard, and the book explanation is often harder to understand, and especially more ambiguous than the official standard of the protocols it is supposed to explain.On the other hand, it is a relatively ""polished"" book, without too many errors or typos. Most of the time, it gives gives enough information to implement the algorithms it talks about. But it certainly doesn't give you enough to become a cryptographer, or to evaluate the security of a new algorithm, or things like that."
2,Not well organized,"This is probably a nice book if you are all ready an expert in network security. But it is not a good book for people who are new to the subject. Though this book covers a lot of material, it is written in a disjointed, inconsistent manner. This text was used for a graduate class and our study group found this book unhelpful because of shifting notation and a lack of consistently building the models in a logical sequence. In one section one type of notation is used, then a section or two later, the same notation means something different, or the same concept is notated differently. There was also a lack of explanation in how the protocols fit together. The study group unanimously agreed that this book made the topics more confusing than they needed to be. Wasting time on sorting out notation rather than focusing on the protocols themselves was irritating. The next version of this book should edit the cohesion of the topics and the notation."
4,Good conditon and timely delivery,"The ""Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)"" book that I bought through Amazon was delivered timely. The book was also in the good condition that was said of it."
1,Sorely disappointed.,"I like to think that in this world there is a difference between being mean and doing mean things. Just because someone might do something that wasn't nice, doesn't necessitate calling them mean. Granted, there are mean people out there, but this book leads you to believe that anytime someone makes a wrong choice, or expects obedience to rules, they are mean. True, when parents yell, they aren't being nice. But most parents aren't mean, they just lose their temper, like most other people do, at times in their life. When you expect your child to eat good food, go to bed, clean their room, etc., that is definitely not being mean. I don't think a book of mean people should be written at all (we don't need more negative in this world), but if it is going to be written, write it about truly mean people. In other words, I don't think this book ought to have been made, let alone be read."
1,Subtlety Is Not For Children,"I borrowed this book from the library and after one reading, I put it away so that my kids couldn't find it. I agree with the other reviewers that the definition of ""mean"" used in this book is too broad. Maybe it was written so that you could discuss whether something was truly mean with your children, but try discussing subtleties such as that with a three-year-old. My six-year-old saw it as vindication of her calling me mean when I get her out of bed in the morning to go to school. I kept waiting for a page to come up saying that just because someone asks us to do something we don't want to do, that doesn't make them mean. That page never came."
1,Missed the Mark!,"I am sadly dissapointed by this book. Toni Morrison is one of my favorite authors--for adults. As a children's librarian, I think this book has missed the mark. My experience with the intended audience for this book, is they will miss the point and take it very literally. The ending appears to quickly close a book that seems to have had no real point from it's inception."
5,The Straight Goods,"In this book, Wodtke presents a no-nonsense design methodology. Initial words condemn the shallowness of a ""design-by-guru"" methodology, and the rest of the book follows this up by giving plenty of hooks for thought and reflective design. Even if you are a seasoned designer and already understand and use the fundamentals that Wodtke puts forward, this book is a valuable opportunity to get into the mind of another designer. Highly recommended."
4,VALUABLE FOR TAMING COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT WEB-SITES,"If your headache is how to overcome maintainance problems in any type of web site, then this book will be of tremendous help to you. It was designed for web designers/administrators whose responsibilities include the design and maintainance of very complex web sites. Its message is cogent and comprehensive. Anybody who listens to it would discover easy ways of designing web sites and flexible intranets which support growth, navigation, management, and above all, ease of use.This is one book whose advice would ensure that most web emergencies are adequately controlled."
3,Another book on usability,"Three first chapters are quite original. But nothing new in the rest of the book. Good ideas. But I won't say that is a basic book or a must read. Is interesting for people who builds websites or deeply interested in them. Is a mixture of usability, test, architecture. And you cannot say the last word on every topic in the world in 300 pages."
4,great IA book that's useful,"I have to say, this was one of the few books that can beused out of the box. Like the book said, this book may notbe too useful for experienced information architects/UI desingers, but you may still learn some new tricks.There are lot of IA/user experience books for the websites outthere, and you may spend lot of money....but if you couldonly afford few books and you are a practicing IA or desinger,new to this field then read this book couple of times."
3,Are you just starting yours studies at IA now?,"I have to ask you a question - ""Are you just starting yours studies at IA now?"". If yes, probably this book will help you. It's easy to read, small and fun. A really nice overview about IA and even usability. You could spend a lot of time reading the polar bear book, and I recommend that, but start reading this book is a nice idea too.Unfortunely, if you have a little more experience on the subject, you won't get such surprising insights like the beginners readers. Christina has writen good things about the creation of personas and scenarios, one entire chapter, and that's all. Sometimes she mixes usability, IA and design in a strange way, losing focus. Even worst is how the book begin and over, very bad, with sad and ingenuous recommendations.Simplifying... if you looks at a nice overview about IA, you'll enjoy reading this book. Otherwise, search for another book, more consistent, with more focus and better ideas, not only common."
4,It's worth taking the time to read a book like this,"This book won't present shocking facts about IA but it puts in writing many things that come in handy when you have to work in this field. The author includes good examples and the book can be read from cover to cover without feeling overwhelmed. Overall, it's worth taking the time out to read a book like this."
3,Pretty standard stuff,"There ain't much to say about web-building that doesn't boil down to Jared Spool's motto: ""It depends...""Does this book fill a real need?Does it clarify the challenges that face designers who have to be business people? Not really.Does it present research in a way that goes beyond what's out there? No, it just uses jargon and gets tangled in terminological quibbles."
2,Trendy opinionated hodge podge,"Christina Wodtke says she doesn't like rules, so she calls them principals. Whats the difference? She says she won't recommend software. So why does she give us a click-by-click review of Adobe InDesign, her ""program of choice""? She even recommends a tall triple latte if you need a caffine high. Hello? In between, she also says some relevant stuff (and takes a lot of time saying it), but the true nuggets of wisdom are easy to miss in this hodge-podge of opinion spiced with California-webchic. Blueprints for the Web reads more like a blog than a book, which is to say it's pretty badly organized for a book that's supposed to teach organization."
3,Good book,"I rated it thee stars because I didn't like the stories much. Unsatisfactory endings for me, some dumb stories. But it is ok, especially as a review or if you want to improve your Italian further after reading better dual language books. I'm usually please (and I am with this one) with almost any dual language book, even if I don't like the stories or translations, because for me the books are to improve my knowledge of the foreign language. But some books are boring, dumb, and otherwise less desireable than those better written and interesting."
5,11 short stories in Italian/English,"Bought this book of short stories in Italian/English to help me learn Italian; And what a great investment it was. I'm speaking it some and spelling every word I've learned. Thank you, thank you. Grazie, mile grazie. Cecilia, VA"
4,Good modern Italian literature,"If you are taking Italian in school and need some literature, you can't go wrong with this little book."
5,peter michaels / phantom,"bought another for my husband. and he bought one for his therapist! this is a very good piece of work and has been of tremendous assistance as we work on our healing. (thank you, peter!)"
5,Incredible Smooth Jazz,"Probably one my favorite songs by George Howard is on this CD entitled ""Only Here For A Minute."" The melody has an almost enchanting embrace to it. This entire CD is as they say, ""OFF THE HOOK."" If you want quality smooth jazz, then start a George Howard collection. He has a polished and soothing style and sound that sets him apart from any other saxophonist. I've been searching for this CD for years in different stores. Maybe I'll get lucky and Santa will deliver it to me for Christmas. What a wonderful gift it would be. You should have it too. Even though George is no longer with us in this world, his music still shines like a galaxy of stars. GET THIS CD!!!!!"
4,Great CD from George Howard!,"This is a tight production, and I enjoy it's exploration of african rhythms here.'Love Struck' is one of my favorite slow tracks here, with the passion of the soprano sax given the spotlight."
4,Mucho Mas Que Un Sentimento,I love it! Jeorge Lewis just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait for his next album!
3,Not quite what I expected,"I made my daughter a really fun mermaid cake with this pan, but I sort of wish I hadn't bought the pan and here's why:It is not tall enough to fit a standard-sized barbie doll, I had to break the back of the cake a little to get my little mermaid to fit (she had to kneel in it). SO unless you are planning on just using the pick doll it comes with, it is really useless for real dolls.THere is a heating rod in the middle to help it cook evenly, but it was still pretty much raw in the middle but kind of burnt on the outside."
1,UNHAPPY!,"I am a professional, its my job and when I get a cake mold kit I expect all the pieces there. For one they said it would arrive on Monday its Tuesday. I have to have this cake ready by Saturday and half the pieces are missing!!"
1,Worse Movie EVER!!!!,This was the worse movie I have ever watched!! I hate I wasted my money renting it!!! Please take it off of the list so that others will not wasted their money on it!!!!!
1,"Don't buy, don't rent, don't watch!!","In case anyone is wondering what the worst Christmas movie of all time is, A Christmas Too Many is certainly in the running. It actually has a pretty good cast, which may fool some people into buying it (it certainly fooled me), but don't do it! This has to be the most pointless, banal, mean-spirited and foul-mouthed ""Christmas"" movie ever, & everyone even remotely involved in it's creation should be ashamed of themselves. (ie, Mickey Rooney took his awful character from A Night At The Museum a few steps further). It's most definitely a ""no-star"" rating-Amazon should give us that choice, as there are many movies out there that deserve it, especially this one. Aargghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"
1,Awful,"Rented this movie from amazon instant video, and didn't like it at all. I should have gone with the reviews, if a movie has only 2 stars don't buy it. Worst movie i've ever seen."
1,Believe us this movie REALLY IS THAT BAD,"I like the others, bought this because it was inexpensive and has people in the cast I know and like. This move is truly wretched. It tries for cynical laughs but can't get them, It rips off National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation but hasn't a shred of the things that gave that movie humor and warmth, and then rips off Weekend with Bernie for good measure. If you feel you absolutely must see it, rent it so you won't be stuck owning it after you turn it off halfway through!"
5,"Poe's Best Long Work -- And His Only, Even","At 150 pages or so, Arthur Gordon Pym is the closest Poe came to a novel. Rife with his characteristic polarization and dreamscape plots, this stands, in my opinion, as one of Poe's best. The short stories included only add to the mainstay, and it's a great value."
5,Setzer is great!!,Just as I expected. More fun stuff from Setzer. Not groundbreaking creative BUT music we've come to expect and enjoy from Mr. Setzer. Tap those toes and crank it up!!!
1,Brians tired of rockabilly?,"I have to admit, I expected a lot more from Mr Setzer. The first track was ok, then it proceeded to go down hill from there. Not much rockabilly happening, then it all comes clear with ""Really Rockabilly"" when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans...world wide. He even gives us Aussies a serv, even though I don't think he has ever set foot here. If Brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing, jazz, rock or whatever, then go ahead, but why slag your old fans?. It's the last time I buy one of his CDs without listening to it first."
2,Not what I expected,I had heard about this Cd in a supplement to my local Sunday newspaper and it sounded interesting. I am a Brian Setzer fan since the Stray Catsdays and have his solo work after the Cats plus the Big Band music which I love. This Cd and the Nitro Burnin' Cd just aren't that appealing to me.For great music Brian's Ignition Cd rocks plus I'm looking forward to his take on classical music in his new Cd coming out soon. He is an amazing guitarist and I love to hear him play but this Cd misses the mark.
4,I Like It,"I bought this computer refurbished and I got it and the CD/DVD drive only worked when I turned it on it's side and then only sometimes, so I had to get that replaced. Now it runs alright, it doesn't run Age of Empires III and that makes me sad."
2,Noisy,"I have had mine for a year and in that year, I have had to replace the hard drive, the card reader went out and the fan is so noisy.Sent it back to HP for repair and the card reader still doesn't work, the fan is as noisy as ever.I have enjoyed the computer, but it should not fall apart so soon. Sorry, no more compaq's, it's apple from now on."
1,Problem,"Mine had a problem with jerky video within the first several weeks and it never was fully resolved. An okay machine for doing work. But unsuitable for applications that demand video performance. Last of all, AMD really fell behind in the chip wars here and the battery doesn't last very long."
3,Good Introductory Book,Good Book for first time Yorkshire Terrier owners. Explains the basics on every area.Recommended for Inexperienced owners.
4,The Yorkshire Terrier Handbook,I was pleased with the time period it took for me to receive this book.It was in great condition.
3,Both a wealth of information and too little,"As a reference book for someone experienced with working on two-stroke outboards, this book is invaluable. For the mechanically-inclined person taking his first jump into working on a specific model of outboard, this may not be the ideal reference.Tables of reference information for all of the models covered are extensive. The descriptions and photos of repair and maintenance procedures do not apply to all of the models covered. Some descriptions are too vague or too broadly written to be useful for the hobbyist. In my case, I have a 1961 Evinrude Lark II, and found that many of the procedures and photos were for other motors that were not similar enough to mine to be of much use.If you are planning to work on several motors covered by this book, I'd recommend it for the reference material. If you are looking for detailed, graphic descriptions of how to rebuild your motor, you might look elsewhere."
1,What book!,"I ordered this book May 12th. When I followed up on June 6th, I was informed the order was automatically cancelled due to a shortage of books. It would have been nice to know this or at least be informed the order is on backlog. No communication.Ironically, the web site still claims there are ""only"" 5 copies left (better hurry and order!) Seems I saw that message when I ordered the book 3 week agoBad online experience. I was really looking forward to this book.Dave H."
3,A Strange Village,"This is a slightly different take on the Hamish Macbeth series. The focus of this book is not a mysterious murder. In this volume Hamish is trying to figure out what is going on in a strange village in which all of the residents seem to be under a spell. Nobody is willing to talk about the strange things that have been happening in the village of Stoyre. With Elspeth's help Hamish is determined to uncover the village's secret.Did I find the solution to the mystery believable? Absolutely not. Still, a bit of a change of pace is nice. The books in which Hamish is outside Lochdubh are never quite as good as those on home turf, but this is a quality series, and all of the books are fun to read."
1,"Gone Hollywood -- mean, rough on reader, lost the charm","I read the book and came to the conclusion that she has gone Hollywood. Then I read the flap note that mentions a BBC series.Gone Hollywood: written in short episodes for readers with a short attention span; lots of ready-to-film violent scenes with little characterization or connecting plot; plenty of stuff for the special effects people; mean and nasty in tone; way too many murders for the locality; little charm or local color; anti-religious and anti-rural cliches; hero of infinite strength and endurance; and of course, a major role for a girl with a bare midriff.In other words, Superman transported to the Highlands with less sex.Hard on the reader -- several sympathetic characters are needlessly killed or seriously injured. A little more work on the plot could have avoided that.Read an earlier one in the series -- or read ""Evans Above"" by Rhys Bowen."
2,Beastie Boys Morph,"How many of you out there knew that Kate (the drummer for Luscious Jackson) was originally in the Beastie Boys back in their punk days? Yup, she played drums on an album they cut in the early 80's, like 1983 or something (it was called ""Pollywog Stew""). Actually it's a very hard album to find, you might have to go to one of those stores that sell alot of imports to find it (although I recently read that it had been re-released with another EP on one CD). I'm not talking about ""License to Ill"" either, it was WAY before that."
3,Nice Try!,"Walt Kelly, who voices Albert Alligator in this piece, was rather disappointed in it, and once you view it, you'll understand why. It tries very hard to be what Kelly imagined, but it falls short of the mark. VERY short, I'm sorry to say. I have followed Pogo since I was a kid back in Queens, New York, and literally grew up loving the strip, which is why I bought this. While I don't regret having bought it,I do feel it could have been better. A LOT better! If you're a die-hard Pogophile there's a chance you might find a redeeming something in this work. Unfortunately, I didn't, which is why it only got three stars."
5,Wow,"Eva came to our school today and told us her story. It was truly amazing to hear her story, I cried. I recommend that anyone who can't hear her in person should read the book."
5,Very Worthwhile,"Ms. Olsson also came to my school today, and her story was amazing. The horrific past she has to live with should be a lesson to the rest of us and I hope that everybody who has the opportunity to read her story will. I know I'm a better person for it, and I hope it has the same postive effect on others as well."
3,This Budnt pan doesn't give a strong pattern,"I bought this budnt pan because I wanted to have a different design on my cakes aside from the more traditional pan I already have. The pictures make it appear as though it will provide a well definded diamond like pattern, but the pan itself does not provide deep enough pockets to make the cakes look like the pictures. The pan itself is great. Very durable and easy to scrub clean without having to worry about teflon, but if you are ooking for something to make your cakes a little fancier, this is likely not the answer."
2,Poodles,I didn't think this book was worth the money. There wasn't a lot of information that was specific to the poodle breed and I found better free information on line. I also purchased The Whole Dog Journal Handbook of Dog and Puppy care and training. This is the book I recommend you purchase. Don't waste your money on Poodles.
3,Poodles are high maintenence.,"First half of the book tells you why you're not good enough to own a poodle, second half covers the basics of owning a poodle if you haven't yet been convinced not to get one. I would like to find a book with alot more specific information on behavior and training, a much bigger variety of haircuts - (not everyone shaves the face of their dog) - This is a good, but not great, book."
2,General/common knowledge information,I'm a first time puppy owner and this book was all general common sense knowledge--specifics were lacking and did not find it helpful
1,this guy is a bit of a jerk,"He writes toward the end of the book that ""loving your pet-quality poodle is admirable."" I understand that he is discouraging people who have no expertise or training in that arena from breeding poodles, but the way he goes about it is exceptionally off-putting and obtuse. Most dogs in this world are pet quality - and we love them because they are loveable, not because we desire to be admired. Moron."
3,"remixes of the single, nothing more and nothing less","A bunch of remixes and dubs of the string-ladden pop song. These are mixes by Shep Pettibone and for the most part contain the essence of the single. There is also a David Morales mix that stays pretty tame compared to his usual garage-y style. This CD represents the beginning of Madonna's inability to make good dance pop records. She barely pulls it off here, but it's fairly meaningless when you reference ""Holiday"", ""Everybody"" and ""Into The Groove."" This is over done. Take it out before it burns. She doesn't make any other good dance songs after this."
4,cool jam,i always dug the glowing vibe of this song.i feel it's one of her best dance songs ever.the mixes are hit&miss but the original song is a must have by Madonna.the video is a trip as well.
3,Could be Deeper !,"This is a great song, but I was a little disappointed by the remixes.The only remix I really liked was Davids Klub Mix.Worth buying for any Madonna fan, but overall just average."
4,You can sing most anything.,"This CD features a whopping seven remixes of ""Deeper and Deeper"". It was a #7 hit for Madonna in the U.S. It's a great song, but do you really need a CD featuring the same song played repeatedly for 43 minutes? If you do, this CD is for you."
3,DEEP DEEP DEEP!!!... COULD BE BETTER!,"THIS SINGLE CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND 6 ALTERNATES REMIXES ALSO. BUT THE REMIXES ARE BAD!!!... THE SIX REMIXES ARE THE SAME... SOME SONG IS GOOD, OTHER NO, BUT THE COVER AND QUALITY OF THIS CD DESERVES A 5 STARS!!!!!!!"
3,I prefer more up to date mixes,"These mixes are early house from the early 90s. They held their own at the time, but they wouldn't stand in a club today. -Unless they were played in a retro room."
3,"Eh, Take It Or Leave It","I am an avid Madonna fan, and was really excited about hearing dance remixes of this fab song were being released. Unfortunately, only 3 of the tracks are good. There's David's Klub Mix by David Morales, (this mix is what Mo based ""Deeper & Deeper"" on in The Girlie Show.) There's also ""Shep's Classic 12"" and ""Shep's Deep Beats"" all very cool. The other mixes just seem sad and lacking. Where are Junior or Hex when you need them the most?"
4,This is one good song!,I really honestly like this song a whole lot. The lyrics are just so catchy and the whole overall rythem just makes you want to get up and dance. But it only gets four stars because the version on the erotica CD is just sooooo much better. Do not buy tis unless you just cannot get your hands on an Erotica CD
5,LOVED IT!!!,I loved this product... I ordered it for my nephew... He LOVED it sooo much... He had to put it on right away!!! His mom is having his picure made it it!! Every COLTS fan should have one!!!
4,Good but certainly not the Greatest,"A few of the episodes had me cracking up. However, I was surprised by the choice of some other episodes because they were not even remotely funny and even boring. I thought with over 30 years of footage, this DVD would be all the best of the best but it wasn't the case. It's still a good value for the money overall."
2,Not what I expected,This was not what I exspected....There were very few funny scenes. The only ones any good were the old Candid Shows.....I didnt like the newer Candid Camera shows....I watched this dvd and got bored....
3,Candid Camera: Greatest Moments,"I ordered Candid Camera: ""What Do You Say To A Naked Lady"",and got ""Candid Camera: Greatest Moments"" instead. I still enjoy Candid Camera, but the seller should have honored my order with the one that I requested and paid for. M. Hess"
1,"To Much Chatter, Not Enough Clips","This box set is a waste of time and money. It's no secret Allen Funt liked the sound of his own voice and loved seeing himself on TV -- and that's mostly what you get with this stingy Candid Camera box set: Funt's endless explanations of what you are about to see, why it's funny and how influential the show was. His son Peter is easier to take but if you've got good footage, why do you need a host at all? Why do you need expensive sets and wardrobes if all you're doing is introducing clips? You'll find yourself fast-forwarding past all the boring chatter (Pam Dawber expounding on why she likes Candid Camera, for instance) for just a handful of clips, and very few of the really classic ones. I recommend the newer generation Candid Camera called Just For Laughs (no hosts, no long set-ups, more gags per minute). Peter Funt HAS great film in the Candid Camera archives, but with this tiresome format don't expect to see much of it."
3,Haircut?,"Can anyone tell me if there's a scene on this video of a man getting a haircut, but the barber isn't actually cutting anything off? My father was in an episode back in the day, so I thought I'd try to track it down as a gift. Thanks!"
4,Good But A Little Repetitive!,Good effort by Cal and he adds some very good values when being a teammate.I would like to have seen some of the hitting skills broken up to even more basic elements.Youth Baseball DrillsAlso consider one of Amazon's top selling Little League books by Marty Schupak.
1,Good ideas but not realistic!,"I don't know about the other reviewers, but I have no access to the beautifully manicured fields that the Ripken family does. The drills are just ok but he really has to come up with some creative ideas for teams that can only practice in parking lots, 1/2 fields, blacktop basketball courts etc."
1,"Same old, same old!",I don't know about you guys but I don't have access to the beautiful fields the Ripkens do. I'd like to have some more creative and realistic drills.Disappointed!
5,Knockest CD,"Aiyyo, anybody who ain't copped this yet, you sleepin on some serious heat. The man Jack lays some stupid clean flows on this album. ""Hey Girl"" is the catchiest fly ... hook ever. You got Die Young w/ Too Short bringin heat. Innocent Youth got heat, He Wasn't Thug Enough is stupid catchy. There ain't one weak song on this album. Wit my chop, and ... wit the mob are hella clean too. Jack did the damn thang with this one, and everybody need to pick up this album. And everybody need to pick up all 3 of AP-9's solo albums...and the 2 Mob Figaz album put out in 2k2."
4,a great light read to give to anyone,"if you want to motivate yourself for the day ahead ,dip in to the excellant selection of inspiring quotations.this is ideal mfor all ages reading abilities or intelect ,buy one one now and grow"
2,Didn't hold my attention.,"This movie seemed like a good attempt to give a fresh angle on immigration through a love story.Not really being a fan of the gritty drama and trauma types of movies, I thought I would give ita try anyway because I went to high school with the writer/producer.I couldn't get past the shaky camera style. In some parts of movies I think it's ok,not from the beginning though-where's the Dramamine?"
1,Not what we expected,"This video was far below my expectations. What I had expected was an educational, fun and informative 1/2 hour about horses. What I saw was quite disappointing especially considering the selling price. It was extremely amaturish, filled with inappropriate and distracting graphics effects. The actual content was minimal with very brief scenarios relating to horses. The ""informative"" scenes never got beyond the brief introductory stage. My feeling after viewing it was that nothing of any value had been relayed and that it was intended as an advertisement for the web site for the company that produced the video. My 9-year old horse lover was not impressed either. Our advise, save your money and pass on this one."
5,this truck is great!!!!,I got this truck for my birthday and it's almost as great as the battle shell! It has staff weapons in the side that pop out when you push on the steering wheel. The engine pops up and shoots ninja stars. it has a sticker for a radar. It has a pulley in the back just like the battle shell. So it is a GREAT vehicle and nothing has broke. But none of the vehicles i have break at all!!
5,Very good.,"80's rock at it's best. Great lyrics, excellent guitar riffs, excellent overall album. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes groups such as Firehouse, Ratt, Poison, and if you know those groups, then you'll know other groups in the same hair metal genre."
3,good & straight ahead,"I haven't owned any Lateef recordings before, and am enjoying this one. A few especially nice tracks (I like jazz flute), but perhaps not an album for the ages. A solid three stars."
4,One 'crazy' maxi-single,"After my first sampling of 'Crazy' on the radio, it has become one of my favorite tracks to mellow out to. My hunt for the tune on CD was daunting at first, since I didn't know the name of the artist or the full title of the song. Fortunately, after (badly) singing a few lines of the tune to a friend, he let me know the title and the artist, Seal.I eventually tracked down the 'Crazy' CD maxi-single, with six different versions of the tune, including club mix and acoustic. Very different takes on the same tune. But the one I wanted the most, the radio version (the full album has an extended rendition), was there to start things off.Some nights when I get home from work, I throw this one in the player, and let the stress ebb from me. Time to get calm, as well as 'crazy'.'Late!"
2,insipid,"While the action scenes weren't bad, there was a lot of wasted dialog on the way. The romantic side of the main character got in the way of the plot and added little.If given another of her novels, I wouldn't waste the time openning the book."
3,"Good action yarn, not world class","VA Stuart knows the Crimean war and has researched it well. Her hero is believable and likeable. The love interest is a bit soapy, but the action is fine, developing a drama and a tension that makes this type of fiction (military novel). The sole fault I would have with the writing itself, which is crisp and not cliched, is with the broad scope action. VA's hero is a Lieutenant with only limited access to the action and course of the war -- VA fills in the gaps for any history-in-the-making that her Phillip Hazard cannot directly see with narration that feels like history book stuff, and can go a little dry.A good fun read, but nothing to put on your resume."
5,seven years later,I don't even remember buying these it's been so long. But I still have them and they have held up well over the last 7 years. Highly recommended.
5,Pyrex dishes,"I loved both Pyrex pans, the 2 quart size is a pefect size, and the 3 quart size is also a good size to bake desserts for family. Order arrived in good time, was well packaged, no breaks or scratches. Enjoy."
1,"Beware - explodes! Google ""pyrex complaints"" and research before buying.","My wife bought a 9 X 13 Pyrex glass pan several weeks ago to cook lasagna for our dinner party. Took it out of the oven and it exploded like a grenade! Glass shards flew across the kitchen into the dining room. Could easily have blinded her! Google ""pyrex complaints"" and you'll see there are hundreds of similar instances. We contacted the manufacturer and got offered a new free pan. Thanks anyway, we don't want to dodge glass shrapnel bombs....."
3,Strong but hard to clean,I've owned these for over a year now. I kind of dread to bake with them since they are hard to clean afterward. Otherwise they are strong and sturdy and functional.
2,"To prove Danny's innocence, the boys must find killer.","This is the 10th official film with he East Side Kids (Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Sunshine Sammy Morrison, Bobby Stone, Stanley Clements). The East Side Kids try to help a girl (Anne Gillis) and her paralyzed grandfather (J. Arthur Young) from Gabriel Dell and his thugs. When Danny (Bobby Jordan) goes back to get her clothes, the paralyzed man is there and the police show up as Danny is leaving. With his eyes, the grandfather motions to the cop the dead body in the other room. The policeman thinks Danny did it. The boys try to help the police in finding the murderer. Noah Berry Jr. plays ""Butch""/""Rusty"". This version was not formulated to fit the screen."
3,10 Mile Range - Yah Right,"The four units I purchased served the intended purpose just fine. Easy to use and set up. We were on the road 600 miles, three vehicles, one being a 26 foot rental truck. Keeping in touch was a must and they worked just fine. However, the claim of a 10 mile range is ludicrous to say the least. Uniden must have tested the range with one on top of Mt. Everest and the other on another nearby mountain top. Battery life is poor to ridiculous even on low power. Smart move is to carry an extra 20-pack of AAA's."
3,Invest in rechargeable batteries,"They work OK- you won't get anywhere near 10 miles in range though. They drain batteries quick, so have a couple sets of charged up rechargeable batteries handy."
2,Battery puzzle,"These radios have good sound, some nice features, the usual fraction-of-listed range; but the batteries are the real puzzle. I'm using brand new hybrid rechargeable AAA's; on a full charge, after two or three hours of intermittent use, both radios were drained--or so they said. But when I took the batteries out, and put them into two other Uniden radios (different model)--they ran and worked for at least another two days! This behavior is reproducible. Sometimes, if the ""drained"" batteries are removed and put back in, the radio goes back to working as if nothing had happened. Really mysterious; I'm going to have to discard them, because they're not reliable; a shame, really."
2,not pleased,The battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only- I am very disappointed in the quality. We need them for emergencies throughout the day- this is a farmed animal sanctuary- non-profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already. I am willing to change my review if we get new batteries. They came on time- they are good quality- other than the batteries
4,Not bad for the price,The two way radios were just the thing to keep in touch with my son on the slopes. The voice is clear and the reception is fine as long as you are both on the same side of the mountain. On a busy ski day there were many others on the same channel and we had to keep changing our channel until we found an exclusive line. The claim of up to 10 miles reception did not hold true for us. Within a mile we were fine then no signal at all. It could be the terrain or the forest. I think if you were in an open field you would have great reception for long distances. We do not ski without them.
4,Young builders fun!,"Magnets are always fun. This set adds to an existing set well, but doesn't lend to owning by itself."
3,Allegro: A novel,"This book Allegro: a novel, I think it could've been muchmuch better if there hadn't been so many unecessary sexual scenes, and so much use of profanity. The story itself was fantastic, but too crudely written, I, as a violinist myself, was somewhat disapointed...definetly not reccommended for children!"
2,Allegro review,"As a violinist, and avid reader of all subjects, I found this novel to be quite tasteless. Machlis presents a crude and unartistic manner (I would not call it style) in his prose. The story-line is overly dramatic, gossipy, and almost connotes a soap-opera quality. Machlis should stick to co-writing textbooks, not novels."
3,One of the few gems from QL's '89-'90 season,"Thank god one of four good episodes(""Honeymoon Express"",""Disco Inferno"", this one,and ""MIA"") from Quatum Leap's second season made it out on video. This Episode has some really cliched moments(pretty much anything Gloria says) but the great humor make up for that. Scott Bakula gives a great performance. One of the series best episodes."
2,Surprised at how short it lasts,"I bought this lip gloss looking for something that would last as long as a lip stain. The application isn't that bad (twist and wait), and the taste isn't bad, but as soon as I put it on, it's gone 30 minutes later. I put it on and it's goopy and sticky because it's a gloss, but after I wait for it to set, it still comes off within 30 minutes. And I'm not obsessively licking or chewing my lips or anything! Honestly, both cheap lipstick and lipstain from the drugstore last 10 times as long as this (and are MUCH cheaper.) Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't last and I find it ridiculously expensive."
5,Love it!,I found out about stila cause my grandmothers friend used it.I was shocked when I saw the price but this seller had a cheaper one on sale. I bought grapefruit. It's not the color for me cause its just like my natural lip color maybe lighter. There was another I wanted but before I could buy it it went out of stock. I think it would've been a better color for me.Initially it took 10-15+ clicks to get it started. It takes about 5 clicks to get anything out for me now. I'll admit I expected it to have more in it but you don't need to use very much. It's a lil gooey if you get to much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality lip gloss.I'll be posting pictures so be sure to check them out! :)
1,price,"I purchase a bottle of Garnier Frutis Fortifying shampoo Daily care,normal hair 25.4 fl oz (750ml)for $5.54 yesterday. I thought Amazon suppose to be cheaper..Disappointed."
5,amazing rythm,"I discovered this type of music while watching ""Broken flowers"", and now I have a real interest in knowing more about this type of ethiopian music. This music is completely out of time in a sense that you can't map it to a specific period and the feeling it gives you is breathtaking. love it!!"
3,Music from broken flowers,"I was struck by the main music on Broken flowers.It would stay stuck in my head for hours.This is very odd jazz with an eastern flavor.Think of being in india even though its african,and listening to a jazz band that play snake charming music.The best tracks are the ones that appear in the movie.But there are about three other really good ones as well.The rest of the songs are decent but not spectacular.With six really good tracks its definitely worth a purchase."
3,Interesting ethnic jazz,"I've been looking for this album for years in local stores, as well as during some trips to Paris, London and so on, but I didn't thought about looking for it in the Internet until now, and I have to say that I'm a little disappointed, maybe because I was waiting for anything better than life, and I ""only"" got some good instrumental music from Ethiopia, almost all close to jazz, well played, with some very good ideas, reasonably well recorded (the tracks come mainly from early 1970's)... In few words, a very good record of jazz and instrumental ethiopian music, as says the subtitle of the album. Almost surely, the problem is not the record, but the expectations created by some enthusiastic reviews I'd read about it. Anyway, I think it's a recommendable work for any person interested in the subject of the compilation."
3,Interesting and unusual jazz type music,First 5-10 titles Ok - in the long rung gets a little monotenous
5,"Honest, real music","This record is epic. There are just a handful of instances in my life when I've heard something for the first time and immediately loved it. This music does that. Just listen to it. You'll be hooked too. Everything about it - the production, the instrumentation, and the playing - feels organic and pure.Must have for every music lover."
5,Amazing.......!,"Wow. I can't stop listening to this album..it's incredible. How did I live without it for so long? It has this mysterious, sexy, intimate, exotic, beautiful sound. My life feels just a tad more complete now. HOT"
1,"Great music, bad quality","This album has a great selection of music, but the recording quality is very bad. Try to listen to it before you buy it"
4,very cool and unusual Afro Jazz/Funk,"I bought this CD on a whim after it was recommended by Amazon, and I really like this album. Fans of Fela and other Afro Jazz / Afro Pop will probably like this one. The difference is that this is EAST African. While the music is primarily jazz and R&B;, there are very clear local influences, which sound somewhat Middle Eastern to my uninitiated Western ears. It's unlike any other CD that I've ever heard, but it's familiar sounding enough to enjoy right away.The sound quality is what it is! It's from Ethiopia more than 30 years ago! The sound quality is relatively primitive, but it's not something that should keep the open-minded listener from thoroughly enjoying this music. I could even argue that the sound gives it another unique touch.My daunting challenge for me now is to determine which one of the other 19 volumes of this series to get next."
5,"Ethiopiques 4, the doro wat of Ethiopian Jazz","Having lived in Ethiopia for the better part of a year, it was great to find Ethiopiques 4. If they had played this on the Ethiopian buses I would have found transition to living there much easier. The music is definately influenced by the West, Miles Davis, James Brown, and Carlos Santana especially, however there are definate Ethio-quirks included. High pitched horns and beautiful Eastern melodies. Every now and then there is a guitar solo that would not be out of place on Iron Butterfly album. If you are looking for the doro wat of music then Ethiopiques if for you. I have also listened to Ethiopiques 3 and enjoyed the funk of that album as well. Not bad for music made by the cops and military"
3,Difficult Game for Younger Children,"My daughter is 10 years old and I purchased this game for her for the Nintendo DS this past Christmas (2006). The price was really good, about $16.00 and I remember playing Pac Man as a kid and figured she would really like it. The game has apparently changed a lot over the years though. She has tried playing it several times and has told me the game is pretty hard. She loves most games and can figure them out pretty easily but this one seemed more difficult."
5,Great experience!!,"The game was great. It met all of my expectations and more!!! Thanks, I would purchase from you anytime again!!!"
4,Good game!,"I never really got to play this game as I bought it as a birthday present for my younger sister, but she really seems to enjoy it and so doesn't my brother. It was a great present :)"
2,Pac Man 3,I purchased this game thinking my children would like it and they rarely play it. They are just not interested at all. I picked it up and started to play it and I was not impressed at all. I found myself putting it down and turning off the game system.
5,Practical gift idea,"These towels are absolutely the best for drying dishes. The company that produces them not only has wonderful customer service, but it also packages the towels beautifully. They make an excellent hostess gift."
3,"Straightforward, but nicely crafted romantic drama","Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman (in her Hollywood debut) acquit themselves well in this pre-Brief Encounter slice of romance and adultery. The other thing that really lifts this production above the run-of-the-mill is Gregg Toland's Oscar-nominated photography and lighting.I also enjoyed one or two of the supporting cast, in particular Cecil Kellaway. His humourous dialogue with the young Ann Todd at the birthday party is charmingly delivered."
4,"""I have been an intermezzo in his life.""","This movie is a remake of a Swedish film which introduced Ingrid Bergman to American audiences. Selznick Studios liked her so much, they brought her to Hollywood to make Intermezzo in English. The story is about a middle aged musician (Leslie Howard) who falls in love with his daughter's piano teacher (Bergman). He leaves his wife to be with her and the two share happy but fleeting moments together in France. There are times when the story becomes overly dramatic, but what it lacks in believability it makes up for in visual opulence.Not only does Intermezzo benefit from a beautiful cast and beautiful music, director Gregory Ratoff does an excellent job of making each frame look artistic. Both of the stars are give many gorgeous close-ups and their beauty helps the love story seem believable. The two just glow when they are with each other."
4,As I Remember It,"The film ""Intermezzo"" is old. I purchased it and watched it again after almost 45 years. The music and story are as good as I remember from teenage years. The most impressive part of the film is the beautiful music (Intermezzo) around which the story is built. If you don't mind the limitations of 1939 film making, you will enjoy this."
2,A Harlequin Romance for the screen,"Given what great scores this flick gets in all the databases, I was shocked at how poor INTERMEZZO is. Sure, Bergman is gorgeous, but that isn't enough to compensate for the trite plotting, two-dimensional characters, and laughable dialogue. Want a strong romance from 1939? Try DARK VICTORY. A 1939 pageant? GONE WITH THE WIND. A 1939 comedy? NINOTCHKA. 1939 Family fare? THE WIZARD OF OZ. 1939 was a fantastic year for movies, so go buy/rent/watch something with a little creativity behind it, and stear clear of this time-waster."
3,A C,"This was a dissapointment to me after buying the most excellent Rebirth. But after a while I quite like it. If you already are in possesion of Rebirth,Temple of Shadows, Angels Cry and Holy Land, you know what I'm talking about; their lowest and worst are still pretty damn good! But if you're novice when it comes to Angra: Buy the other ones in the order above."
3,Could be better,"I was looking forward to hearing this CD,and was a little disapointed.But on second listen I liked it better.I'm glad they don't keep repeating pass sounds,and that is one of the things I love about this band.It is the diversity in every CD I own by Angra.So in reallity,this derserves a 3 and half star rating,but I couldn't bring my self to give it 4 stars.For as long as we waited between CD's,I expected better.It's a good CD,and would recomend period."
4,"Raw energy, no pretense","Along with Troops of Tomorrow, another punk classic, this album hits hard with its simple raw energy. No listener should expect an enlightening experience. Another review attempted to make a point by rattling off band after band in some weak comparison. But the Exploited's real message isn't contained within a bunch of pseudo-intellectual lyrics. In fact, much of the music lashes out against this exact type of uptight poser attitude. It's all about the energy and the agression."
5,A good album to start with.,This is one of those CDs that you literally end up listening for almost a year or year and a half. this album is literaly that good. I could just say for fans that this is required.
3,For Christ's Sake,"I like the Exploited and I love their music. And note that I'm not a ""punk rocker"" because most people who claim to be ""punk rock"" are just a little clique that accuses everyone of being a poser. Everything is about being ""punk rock"" and it gets old. Just grow up and stop whining about your punks and posers."
4,The Barmy Army!,"Great Exploited. At times the lyrics are laughable, but for a bunch of punks in the late 70s and 80s, it didn't matter, and it still doesn't. Great, catchy punk rock music, and it beats modern Exploited with a stick. I would recommend this to any punk rock or Oi! fan, old or young, old school or new school. This CD I think can appeal to punks, skins, kids who like punk, and older people who listen to music from their childhood. Great, great stuff."
5,Oi!,"Punk most certainly is not dead while The Exploited are still in action. They maybe completely untalented but thats as per usual for punks, who can blame us. Anarchy rules and so does this album. It provokes a flame in any Punk that won't die; the mere suggestion that Punk's dead will cause rioting whilst bands such as The Exploited are in action. Wattie Duchans mellow vocals prevail and would melt butter if you put some next to a speaker (wink). love from Atak from Anarchy Inc."
4,Original hardcore that helped to start it all!,Pure old school. No popcore here. One of the best harcore albums by one of the best hardcore bands!
4,yo why people gotta hate,"you people are dumb and throw around the word punk to easily and make it sound so comercial stop worrying about what other people think and say about music and do your own thing stop hatin thats true ""punk"". so f@#K off deathmetal90 you are the biggest poser here. by the way im really 18 i just this just seemed easiaer and quicker to do"
1,PUNK MUST DIE!!!!,"O.K. kids, listen up! If this garbage is what punk is suposed to be then PUNK MUST DIE. The Exploited are proof that England never really understood the AMERICAN art form known as punk rock. Silly hair cuts, smelly arm pits and super dumb lyrics hardly consitute good rock'n'roll and this album proves it. This stuff has none of the soul or groove that groups like Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, New York Dolls, Ramones or Dictators had. American punk bands understood rock'n'roll history and didn't abandon the roots of punk. The Exploited really do a fine job of turning good 'ole red blooded AMERICAN rock'n'roll into a brainless, stupid and moronic embarasment. F*%k The U.S.A? NO, F#%K THE EXPLOITED!!!!"
2,GMR1558-2ck range,"I understand that the 15-mile range is based on GMRS and ideal conditions, but I have not been able to get more than 1 mile apart with reasonable communications. I did get just over a mile but the call function didn't work and the conversations were quite static-y and choppy.Otherwise, I guess they are fine, but don't count on any kind of ""long-range"" use."
1,"If I could, I would have given this zero stars","Boy, are these radios useless...I really should have checked here before I bought them. I live in Los Angeles, and the radios only worked within a two block radius. The battery, advertised with a 16 hour battery life, managed to last less than five minutes. Don't waste your time and money on these!"
5,A Very Good Running Shoe,"Appearance, support, cushion, all are good. The shoe is bouncy, Adidas have made a good shoe for a good price, I use this for running on pavements as well as in forest reserves, the other shoe I use is Adidas Climacool,Good for running and also on weekends,"
4,ER- doug ross' season,"Well i only bought this because i started watching on Netflix and they don't have season 2 available yet. It was a very good season and focused often on the character of Doug Ross. What can you say about George Clooney in ER .. seems like he was playing himself, he has since grown much better as an actor. But he had such sex appeal, and charm as Dr. Ross, and a movie star in the making, it's well worth watching for any Clooney fans out there."
3,at least one defective disc,"I love the story and the episodes, however the 3rd disc was flawed and the video was poor. the first 2 were okay and the 4th seems to be fine."
3,Am I the only one with this problem?,"I can't seem to find anyone else with this problem, but every season I've purchased (all 3 at one point) has had some sort of screw up in atleast 2 episodes. On my season 2 disc I can't even watch episode 3 because it just freezes, and episode 4 keeps skipping forward to 23 minutes and than has a bunch of skips after that.This happens in all 3 seasons for me, so be warned that you may not be able to watch some episodes."
3,What Happened Between Season 1 and 2?,"Season 2 of ER is a sad shadow of season 1. They changed the characters what were charming in season one to inept jerks...especially John Carter. It no longer has that ""you're right there"" feeling that the first season had and turns it into a boring, predictable melodramatic soap opera. The camera work and acting is just as brilliant as the first season which is a shining reason to watch it. I'd not miss watching the first season just because the second season is disappointing."
5,Grew up with this show...,"and even today it still delivers the same impact that it did then. The acting of the main characters is superb, and their ability to deliver drama the way it is written and the way it should be is truly a gift to all fans of this show. I found myself watching episode after episode of this season as well as seasons 1 and 3. Season 4 needs to come out soon so as I can continue watching this series in order."
3,exciting,It was a good show and i loved all the medical language and procedures. They had a good thing going
5,Wonderfully Kept!,As a collector of DVD TV shows I was happy to find this one DVD box set of ER season two in really nice shape. I am adding it to my collection which I plan on enjoying for years to come. Thank you!
5,ER Season 2,"If you're an ER addict like me, and you missed the first and second season way back when, then this is a must. I LOVE CARTER!! The first and second season set the whole basis for the key characters of the original series. Even though there is a whole new set of characters now, it's still fantastic watching with a great plotline and wonderful characters. The extras are great too, with commentary from the director and others, and some outtakes which are always fun for a laugh. GET IT!!"
3,Average quality,"While this product does offer a large number of clipart images on only a few disks, I found less than half is better than average quality.One of the four disks is exclusively web art. But I would not call it art! Not even a simple personal web page would benefit from this unimaginative and useless collection.The catalog interface for the main clipart program is easy to use my only complaint is that if you find something you like and save it, the long scroll bar is reset to the top, losing the place where you were just browsing through the collection.For [money] it is not a bad product I guess, but you should definately shop around and look at other titles before deciding on this one."
1,Very Disapointed,"I purchased Clickart 400,000 and have never felt more taken advantage of by a software company. You see only 150,00 of the images are actually in the box Ibought. The rest I have to sit on my stinking 56K modem and wait for them to download. I could not believe this when I realized it. I went and looked at the box andsaw there was a tiny asterick saying that only some of the images are actually in the box and that you needed to go online for the rest. If I wanted to buy an internetsubscription I would have done that. I will never buy another Broderbund or Clickart product again. There are plenty of reputable clip art products out there that do nottry to fool their customers."
1,From a teeny pop lover,"I thought that this entire CD was empty sounding. All the pop beats with the exception of Oops, Stronger, and Lucky's beats didn't flow with her voice and it sounded consistantly like something was missing. It didn't have the strong harmonies of N SYNC or the BSB, and it also didn't match it's beat with the heavy pop beat with say Jessica Simpson's I Think I'm In Love (although I am dissapointed the she got the opening to Jack and Diane in that song). All in all I was dissapointed and thought she could have done a lot better, since the pop beats were mediocre and the ballads were terrible."
3,Too reptitive for my liking.,"This cd is ok, but way too much hype. I mean, 'Oops', 'Don't go knocking on my doorr', 'What u see' and 'Can't make you love me' are clones of each other. Although they are good songs it makes them so easy to get bored of. My favourite songs are 'Lucky' (One of the best songs this millienium) and 'Stronger'. The ballads are a little too icky for me, although i like 'When your eyes..' and 'Girl in the mirror'. I much prefer her last album, although the songs weren't quite as strong, they were more individual and had different types of music. I listen to it alot, but skip out some songs, it's an average album. Christina Aguilera however, simply ROOOLLLSSS!"
1,"Oops, she did it again (unfortunately)","Yes, Britney did it again, everyone. She blows up the pop scene with her not-so-talented voice paired up with ok lyrics. I am a teenager and of course I love pop music. What teenager doesn't? I really don't think this album is much more than a over-hyped immitation of a ...good singer. All she is , is a dressed up 18 year old with not enough supervision, too much freedom, and way too big ego. My advice to you as a fellow cd buyer is, please, don't buy this. You will only be wasting money that could be used on better cds."
2,Solipsistic Foolishness,"She croons the album title, ""Oops I did it again"" with a fake sincerity. I should say this of the whole album.There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album. Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line. The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion. So no she did not do it again.She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself. That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is. Who is the ""I"" in ""I did it again""? Clearly it's not the ""me"" in ""Baby, hit me one more time.""I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her. I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less. Though I must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry."
1,what is brittany spears?,"i have to say that i did not enjoy her at all. her music reflects a stereo-typical white girl that thinks shes a stereo-typed black girl that lives in a ""ghetto"" neiborhood with ""played-out"" boy problems, and identity crisis. i believe that the media should give up on believing that ""this is what sells"", and give a chance to someone else who can truly express her life as a teenager with this day and age in her music without being an Agreeing-Associate to so&so records and having co-editors like maybe some guy named 'steve' that writes first drafts to most of britannys' songs. truly i feel sorry for her that she isn't yet 18 and already sold herself."
4,oops!,well there are a few songs on the cd that i can relate to because i got this cd just a few days before this guy broke up with me. the song stronger made me think that i should just get over him and move on. there are a few other songs that i like on the cd but the rest aren't what i would call grammy material.
4,Pretty Good,"I like this cd minus the talking. The talking is so dumb. I don't like track 5, 9, 12. OR THE TALKING. I like the songs, I think she is a good singer and this is better than her last cd. I like this cd though and would reccomend it. You can skip the talking."
4,Clever!,"At first listen this seems to be another pop album about dating boys and tooth decay. Listen again, intrepid pop mavens, for BSpears has much to say on the state of social degradation in these trying times. The first few songs are apparent throw-aways, a warm-up of things to come. I know most reading this are either pro-Britney or adult, but this is really a mature album. Themes range from the desperation involved in being a pop star (""Lucky"") to how tough it is to be a pop star (""Dear Diary""), and everything in-between. I recommend this to all pop music fans who are desperate for a breath of fresh air!-Bean"
2,she didn't do it again,"this cd was over an OK cd... however, there were some pretty bad songs such as (I can't get no) Satisfaction she totally ruined the song. Also, some songs there were a lot of computerization in it and it made her sound worst! Some of her songs are OK like Lucky. The upbeat songs are pretty good but the slow songs just makes me fall asleep. Overall, this is an OK album but it's worst than the last one, that's all I gotta say."
1,I was diasappointed.,"Her voice is ok, the lyrics for most of the songs are okay, but I cant stand people tampering with good songs ALREADY MADE (satisfaction). She has No talent except for her voice, anyone can learn to dance, and she doesnt even play any instruments! dont get the cd, waste of money."
5,Britney is no flash in the pan,I just wanted to say that Britney's music is not all sugar and spice. It is actually danceable and talented. I myself always seek those who are truly talented. ie: they write their own music. She can. I love Dear diary. Satisfaction is a great old song revitalized with a new rythmn. Truly a good album.
5,Oops she did it again!,"Oops she did it again! But this time she did better! I love this album! Who cares what other people say about Britney, she's pretty, she's got great dance moves etc. Anyways, I reccomend you buy this C.D. today!My favorite songs are: Stronger, Lucky, and When Your Eyes Say It."
5,"Oh Baby, Baby...","Britney Spears started her singing career at the age of 3. When she released her first ever album (at age 16), it was a smash hit. Her song ""Baby One More Time"" reached number one on her new album. !When ""Oops!&#65533;I Did It Again"" came out, I hurried to buy it right away. Thank goodness I did. They were going like hotcakes! Britney Spears' songs on here are pretty good. I'm only familiar with 3 songs on the album: Oops!I Did It Again, Stronger, and Lucky. I really enjoy her music videos. Now, Britney Spears is coming out with a brand new album entitled ""Britney"", which includes the main song ""I'm A Slave 4 U.""From ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" to ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", Britney Spears has changed a lot. I think she is going to make an amazing comeback."
1,yuck!,"BAD BAD BAD!! GAG! don't get it. all the songs sound exactly the same with her weird UH's, and YEAH's. if you're looking for a good CD, check out christina aguilera's or jessica simpson's. maybe britney will be able to release something better next time."
5,Oooppps...she did it again only this time better!,Britney Spears always comes out with something catchy! You can't help it but get up and dance! This album rocks!
2,Sometimes I .....Wonder?,"I'm still left to wonder how Britney really made it. But hey the public must like her if she sold millions of albums. Oops... did it again is kind of cute but the ballad ""don't let me be the last to know"" is a waste of voice for her. Shania is and excellent song writer and Britney just doesn't have the voice to carry the song out the way it should be. We'll see how long this one lasts...."
1,She makes me sick,"I normally love pop music but she just ruins it! forget about girl power here. All her song ever on both albums are about her whining over some dumb boy she lost. ""Baby one more time..."", ""Crazy"", ""Lucky"", ""from the Bottom of my Broken Heart"", ""Oops I did it again"", the list goes on and on."
2,Oops...I Hate This One Too,"Pathetic. Are you people normal? So what if she looks good, her songs are ALL the same. OK, I admit they are catchy and easy to listen to, and I can listen to it but I would never dream of giving my money for it. If you really want to buy a new album, make it Binaural by Pearl Jam. Oh, and she's not that good looking, she looks fake. Think about it, you can see girls as good looking as her every day in the street (if you go out at all)."
1,same old thing,"I really didn't find the cd that great. The music and lyrics don't just sound like her first album, they sound like every other pop act's musci and lyrics as well. I think it was overhyped, but that's my opinion. I wouldn't buy it without listening to someone else's copy first"
3,A decent 2nd attempt,"All in all, I feel that this album proves that Britney still has a long way to go. It is no doubt better than the first album. There are some good songs (Stronger, When Your Eyes Say It) and some really bad songs (Dear Diary, Where Are You Now). I feel that Britney tried to show a more mature side of herself which she succeeds in. But she never ventures out from the pop star mold. I feel that there is a great album in her, if she would only take some risks in her music and not stick to the trusted and successful formula. In an MTV interview she said that she would like to stick to pop music. I hope that it is not a hint that she will be making this type of music for the rest of her career. It would be nice if Britney looked at artists like Janet Jackson, who reinvent themselves for every album, and gotten a few ideas. Overall its a good album, but how many more like this will Britney put out? Take some risks and shock the music world."
1,"No, No, NO!","Why? Why are we subjected to this again? Didn't Ms. Spears do enough damage last time around? This album is a complete and utter waste of money. Ms. Britney cannot sing -- her vocals are atrocious and ear-splitting. And why oh why did she cover the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction""? If you can't do a song better than the orginial artist, don't cover it at all and she certainly did not do that song justice. This cd is sure to sell, but please people..."
1,She did it again . . . she made a bad cd,"Well, Britney has sunk yet again. Although her music will please some ears, her terrible voice, etc. only made my head hurt. Her cd is going to be wildly popular, I know, but for goodness sakes, please, no more cds, Britney!"
5,Amazing!,"Beautifully writen lyrics. Wonderful voice. Better than the last album! Some songs make you wanna dance and some make you cry (in a good way). Even the pictures are nice! They even give you the lyrics to Oops!...I Did It Again, Stronger, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, and Lucky, which is really great! I love to sing along! This album is different. She declares herself, which is great. It's more spritual. It really is beautiful. So, BUY IT even if you don't like her, you will!"
3,Oops!... I Did An Ok Album.,"I think everyone knows that Oops... I Did It Again does not have the strength of her first song Hit Me Baby...One More Time.And the same goes for the album.I must say though that the album does have a much more adult approach.But to me if she does not get some help quickly this song seems to mark the end of her career like the Spice Girl's last album Spice Up Your Life.The album shows a weekness to her. Most pop stars second albums come out strong like *NSYNC or Backstreet boys, but not hers.I think its only worth getting the album if you liked the sound to Ginger Spice's new album or Sporty Spice's new album.If you didnt like any of those then just buy the single 0ops....I Did it Again.Cause Oops ... I Did it Again is the closest to a pop sound like her first album really, maybe 2 more songs but that is really it.And the ballads really have no distinct sound them."
1,The worst,"Let me say this once, I listen to music that I'm told by people who listen to this that it isn't music. Ha ha ha! She can sing ol' Brit but she's no musician, she has nothing unique about her at all. You want something good, try Nile (fantastic), Cryptopsy, Lamb of God, Masonna or anything from any other genre in fact. The beats are all the same and the obvious playing and replaying of the hooks is funny. Grow up."
1,not worth even one star,"avoid this piece of pop trash and her lousy album.anyone giving this cd more than one star is a nutcase,so please stay far away from this miming babe and all her cd's and dvd's please."
1,absolute moron material,"If you like this music you need professional help!!!See a psychologist or something. C'mon, Oops I did it again?! She is running out of ideas!!! This c.d. isn't worth spit!!! Get a life, and step away from the c.d.Thank you!!!"
4,In her own words... Britney Spears does it again.,"I know, I know (you parents out there), it's Britney Spears. For the past year she has had our youth walking around with exposed tummies singing, ""Oh baby, baby..."" Now with her new CD, Oops!.. I Did It Again, she has indeed done it again. The beat is spirited and the words mix pensive, teen-love reality with a nice boost of attitude. (What love-struck teen doesn't need a little self-esteem?) Each track emanates what America finds enduring about this teen superstar; sexiness, innocence, and savvy-ness with talent. You can dance to this CD, exercise to this CD, and simply enjoy listening to this CD. It has substance. Yes, Britney Spears is young with what some might term a ""mature message"" but she continues to enrapture young guys and girls with her good image and good music."
2,"In general, same style as before but not done as well","I really liked Britney's first CD and bought this one because of that. However, the CD has been disappointing. I like ""Ooops!...I did it again"" except for a section in the middle where a dialogue was inserted - it was unfortunately very fake and takes away from the song. The rest of the songs are just okay. There are many dialogues inserted into the various songs but all of them sound more empty-headed than anything. I am quite disappointed. As someone who loves her first CD the second one does not live up to the first. I do not believe I will buy any more of her CDs in the future."
3,Hmm..may take a while.,If there is a * next to it is on my iPod. And if there's a # it's updating.Oops!...I Did It Again..B-...#Stronger..B...#Don't Go Knockin' My Door..C...#(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction..D-Don't Let Me be the Last to Know..A+...#What U See (Is What U Get)..B...*Lucky..B-...*One Kiss From You..C+...#Where Are You Now..Haven't Listened too.Can't Make You Love Me..C+...#When Your Eyes Say It..Haven't Listened too.Dear Diary..Haven't Listened too.Overall Grade......C-Those of songs I have not listened to were not included in my overall grade.
2,She Did Do It Again...,"This really isn't a bad album. It's just Britney's voice that makes the whole thing terrible. Her voice is electronically altered. I like pop music and all, it's just that Britney Spears is the first on my list of ""Don't Want to Buy These Cds."" Even so, you may want to buy the cd because she does have some messages behind the songs ""Stronger,"" and ""Can't Make You Love Me."" I recommend Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Do not buy this cd unless you are a full fan of Britney's."
3,Britney Spears BubbleGum Pop Queen Reigns?,"After much hesistation, i bought the album... i bought it due to much hype and radioplay. Her songs are easy-listening and highly contagious, once you listened you will soon find yourself abashedly humming along... it is that catchy! But after playing like over a dozen times, it starts to grate your ears with it's over happy la-la bubble-gum songs, so i will only recommend it to people who are fans of bubble-gum pop or just love a good fun party cd.... or to those guys out there who just can't stop drooling over the cd cover.... =)"
3,Has its moments..,"This cd has some great pop songs like 'Oooops', 'Stronger', 'lucky', 'what u see' and 'cant make you love me'. Some ok songs like 'one kiss from you' and 'dont go knockin', it also has some ABYSMAL songs like her awful version of Satisfaction (she should of just left this alone!!) and Dear diary. Altogether, id say it is the same standard of her last album , the music is VERY predictbale and repetitive. If u like this kind of music your gonna like it."
3,Nothing exceptional . . .,"I personally don't think this album is anything exceptional. I bought it after hearing clips of What U See and Can't Make You Love Me on the radio. Those two songs are great, and Lucky is another good track. But the rest are either bad or mediocre. Oops I Did It Again and Stronger were overplayed. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is on the boring side. Dear Diary is a song I'm having a hard time taking seriously. Another bad side of the album is that Britney's voice isn't exceptional. It's unique, but it doesn't sound good on many of the tracks. While Jessica and Christina can really sing, they seem to be overshadowed by Britney which in my opinion isn't very fair. So in conclusion, it's worth buying if you've liked the singles from the album already. However the radio has overplayed a good majority of the songs on the album."
3,"Good sophmore album, but needs improvement","I can't seem to understand why Britney Spears has attacked the Billboard charts with her singles and her not so professional voice. Yes, the music is good but minus one star for the vocals. If she gets more years of training by a REAL professional vocal coach, the next album could be a better success than all of her albums combined. Minus another star for lyrics. If Britney wants to be an artist, she's going to have to write her own songs because she is only classified as a singer not an artist. Britney needs to have a creative mind and needs to think what she wants to sing about. If she does, Britney will be able to write her own songs and become a better sucess. REAL PROFESSIONAL vocal training and a CREATIVE songwriting ability are the key elements if Britney really wants to be a star in the music industry."
5,Britney Does it Again!,"Wow! Britney! Nice job! Yes, this is Brit's 2nd fab album! This time the sound is way more mature this time and has a little more R&B edge to it. This is the best present for anyone or just a small gift to yourself! Britney rules 4-ever!"
1,She needs help,I used to be a fan of Britney Spears but then her voice....changed. Is she constapated or is she choking on something? Its hard to tell. Her voice is no Jewel or Christina. Shes also a little too sexy for her younger fans. Does she even realize that she has more younger fans than older fans. Oh ya and more FEMALE fans than MALE fans?
1,...,"Gothic metal singer Dani Filth of Britian's Cradle of Filth once joked that they would do a Spaears song for a prank and send it to her. If Dani follows through on his vow, there could be some song writing lessons for Spears on how to NOT make dreak like this horrid album. but then again, why would the talented and gifted Cradle want waste time on child porn prattle like this?Vomit.Kaenan 1340"
1,"Cant sing, Cant dance","Now I have no problem with Britney Spears as a person at all. But let's face facts, she cant sing. This CD was awful. I think the only reason I bought it was because I gave into the Britney hype. All the tracks sound alike. The only reason shes singing is because she has the look. Everyone loves the little blonde belching out sweet melodies about heartache and love. But did they ever actually stop and listen to her sing? Take my advice, if your a person who does stuff just to be with the ""in"" crowd, go ahead and get this CD. But if you have any sense, go get Aaliyah's new CD, or if you like the blonde teeny bopper idol, get Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson."
1,HORRIBLE!,Britney Spears is the worst excuse of a female singer I've ever heard! She can't sing! She doesn't write her own music! And she's the biggest discrace to music in all history! If you want to hear some REAL female singer/songwriters listen to Alanis Morissette or Tori Amos!
4,Oops!,"Of the 4 studio albums she's made to date, I think this is the ""worst"" studio-album made, although i love it, as a britneyfan.01. Oops!...I Did It Again [9/10]02. Stronger [8.5/10]03. Don't Go Knockin' on My Door [8/10]04. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction [6+/10]05. Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know [9/10]06. What U See (Is What U Get) [8/10]07. Lucky [8.5/10]08. One Kiss from You [8/10]09. Where Are You Now [8/10]10. Can't Make You Love Me [8/10]11. When Your Eyes Say It [7/10]12. Dear Diary [7.5/10]13. You Got It All [7/10]So yes, i think ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" is her worst song sung, and covered. Album average: 8/10"
3,GOOD CD at FIRST...BORING with TIME,"I really wanted to give this a 3 1/2 but I can't. When I first bought this CD I was expecting a really great CD. When I got it, I was pretty disappointed, but some of the songs were good and catchy. When I started listening to the CD, I found the songs were quite good (even though most of the songs have background music from her first CD), but after a week I started to get bored with the songs. If you're a TRUELY DEVOTE BRITNEY FAN then you should buy this. If your not you may want to think twice before buying this CD. When you first start listening to it, the songs are quite catchy. After a week or so of listening to the songs though, you'll be quite bored with the songs. Now I kinda regret buying this CD. The life of this CD is quite short."
2,It's Okay,"Well even thought I think this second cd sounds alot like the first one, its an okay CD if you are just a die hard Britney fan. Here's my adivce to Ms.Spears........Britney you are a talented dancer and a very strong and beautiful young lady.Why don't you try acting or modeling because I really do feel that singing is not your thing."
5,Amazing!,"This CD is awesome! Since I've gotten it I haven't stopped listening to it. Her voice, songs--everything sounds much more mature than her other CD. I love the song ""Stronger"" ""Don't Go knockin On my door"", ""lucky"", and ""what u see is what u get."" The other songs are awesome. A must buy for any Britney fan"
2,Opps...she didn't do it again,"Her new cd is exacly like her old cd. If you know those songs than all you have to do is relearn new words because it is the same turn (almost:>)) But i do like some of her songs. I don't like ""Opps...I did it again"" because it is treating a guys feelings like gum...u throw it away after your done. They are humans too."
4,"Indeed you did, Brit! Indeed you did!","In the fine tradition of Wierd Al Yankovich, Spike Jones and other musical comedy masters, Britney Spears soars head and shoulders above the rest as hilarity pours from the speaker to your ears. This was indeed one of the funniest albums ever to grace my stereo and I thank the comedy gods for Britney. Thank you comedy gods!"
1,The Bottom Line is......,"Britney can't sing worth a flip. She needs singing lessons desperately to get rid of her horrible nasally tone. Some of the songs may have a great beat, but I wish someone else would have sang them!"
5,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!,"Britney Spears rocks! She doesn't deserve a one star review, not even a four, she's gotta be first class, a five star! Here's my reviews on the songs from one to ten:1: Opps!...I Did It Again - 8 2: Stronger - 8 3: Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - 10 4: I Can't Get No Satisfaction - 6 5: Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - 7 6: What U See (Is What U Get) - 7 7: Lucky - 10 8: One Kiss From You - 9 9: Where Are You Now - 6 10:Can't Make You Love Me - 6 11:When Your Eyes Say It - 612:Dear Diary - 7"
2,Too formulaic and recycled stuff,"Not that I cannot appreciate pop music - in fact I rather find Lucky and Oops - I did it again rather infectious with Britney Spears manipulating her vocals to the mechanical line of previous hits like You Drive Me Crazy. In this album, it proves a grave disappointment with the rather superficial lyrics and lack of stretch of her range. ""I can get no satisfaction"", ""What u see is what u get"" - provocative titles but shallow insights. The only other song that I find good is ""Dear Diary"" - Britney has that innate talent to entrench herself in the pop-arena - but with monotonous and formulaic approaches - it won't get her very far. We will appreciate more daring stunts instead of feeding us easy fodders by Max Martin. Maybe the next album will have fans calling out ""Oops- she already did that."""
3,oops...i farted again,"I was really disapointed when I bought this cd. It is really a fart, do you know why? Because this cd came too early and really in the wrong time.Britney in an interview to a Brazilian network said ""I promise, my voice will be better and much more mature"" well...she didn't quite kept that promise. The songs are nice, but it seems the beat is the same in every song. I must confess I really enjoyed some songs like ""Satisfaction"" that is a very interesting version and I really liked the songs that were written by Shania Twain and Diane Warren. It is a pity that britney still don't have the gift to write her own songs( She only wrote one song, ""Dear Diary"") but well, what can I do? This cd is nice,nothing beyond that... sorry Brit, you didn't ""did it again""."
4,She Did It Again!,"Britney's new album, Oops!...I Did It Again! is just a great cd. The first 7 songs are all up-beat (except 5) and want to make you get up and dance. She made a real change in her music from the first album and I highly recommend this great cd to everyone."
1,Oops is right! She did it again :-(,"If you think Britney Spears has a full, remarkable voice you need to clean out your ears. In her latest single, ""Oops...I did it again"" she sounds like a baby trying to sing the menu of McDonalds. She hasn't come a long way in voice maturity in the past couple years, that's for sure. Still the same annoying, teenybopper sound. If you want someone with real sound, look for the new POP album coming out by LeAnn Rimes. That's true talent."
1,"Oh, no. Please don't do it again.","I am not here to criticize Britney Spears' obvious lack oftalent or the fact that all she is selling here is sex. I am here togive my honest opinion of the album, so that inquiring minds and people who plan to purchase this album will know how I feel about it. This album is bland, recycled, pop garbage. I would not listen to it again for anything short of a million dollars. Britney Spears won't be sticking around for the long haul. She doesn't have the talent to carry her through. It is my advice to potential buyers that they purchase *any* CD other than this one. Good luck, Britney. You're going to need it."
1,Oops I did It Again? What the heck did you do the first time?,"The fact that my sister keeps listening to this CD like it's actually good is driving me crazy. This was worse than the first piece of trash. I wasn't shocked to find that there is not even ONE actual SONG on the whole so-called album. I mean, were there any actual INSTRUMENTS used to back up that ""voice""? Man, talk about overproduced. Can this even be called music? Oh God, and the little voiceovers before songs like Lucky and that Rolling Stones cover that she butchered (Satisfaction) are just absolutely the epitome of awful. Please, don't waste one cent on this CD.UPDATE: Considering all the garbage that was released after the Days of Britney and Friends, I now feel that this album is not the crappiest recording on the planet. This is a sad day in music, indeed."
5,Favorite of her CD'S,"I love this album so far the best. My favorite song on it is, One Kiss From You. I strongly recommend it for Britney fans like me. Or just for people who are thinking about buying it."
1,I wish they'd let you rate albums with 0 stars,"This is truly a new low point in the history of music making. I am pleading with you not to let the marketers win. Britney is talentless, but she makes a fine looking puppet who says all the right things. Unfortunately, these days that equals huge success. All I know is that music works in cycles and I guarantee that in a few short years there will be plenty of embarrassed owners of this CD...let's just hope it's not TOO many."
2,She just HAD to do it again...,"ok is it just me or is this cd full of tasteless 'singing'? all the fast songs have the same beat as 'oops i did it again', especially 'what you see is what you get'. and whats up with 'dear diary'? it sounds way childish. the only good songs on here are 'lucky' and 'what you see is what you get'. 'satisfaction' is the weirdest song. full of 'uhs' and funny sounding growls. hate to say it but her 1st cd is much much better"
2,Oops!...is quite appropriate,"I gave this album two stars because it contains two good songs-- the title track, and the Rolling Stones remake. The rest of it is very forgettable at best. Britney's last album lacked strong vocals, but at least it had a high percentage of rather catchy tunes that went over well despite her lack of vocal prowess. The songs on ""Oops"" are bland at best, and the annoying dialogue between songs is enough to destroy any hint of artistic merit lurking somewhere on this album."
2,Bubblegum pop is a sickening sweet,"I bought this album clearly to find out if it lived up to the whirlwind of hype created around it. What I found was computerized voices, sythesizers galore, and really no ""quality"" music. My one question: What would happen if the power went out? Well, I guess the answer is clear. Britney would have to survive on natural talent. Enough is enough."
1,one star for the guy on the knobs,"This is perhaps the most puerile dribble I have ever heard. What it has is a seductive, strong drumbeat, hypnotically sucking the listener into a morass of silliness. Some of the lyrics are almost funny in their awkwardness, and verge on illiteracy.""My friends say you're so into meAnd that you need me desperatelyThey say you say we're so complete""Worse yet is the cover of the Jagger/Richards ""(I Can't Get no) Satisfaction,"" which is full of vocalized wiggles and oooh ahhh uhhhs in a girlish whisper.Without the heavy percussion, and the electronic effects, one is left with practically a vacuum; one that has been polished, packaged, rehearsed, and sold as ""music.""There should be a new category for stuff like this. Maybe somewhere between ""Books,"" ""Music,"" and ""Kitchen & Housewares,"" we could have ""Rubbish.""The booklet insert has extensive recording info, some of the lyrics, and lots of ""cute"" photos. The sound is lavish, and the total time 44'35 minutes too long."
2,Better than the first album but still very bad,"Besides the 5 singles, there are a few good songs. ""Don't go knocking on my door"" is an okay R&B influenced track, ""Satisfaction"" is not as bad as some people say, it's a funny and danceable cover and I really like it. ""What you see is what you get"" is another okay Pop track and even though ""Where are you now"" is a little too melodramatic, it's another track which I don't hate. But even though there are a few songs which I like, ""Oops! I did it again"" remains a very bad pop album."
2,Very Upsetting,"When I got this CD I thought it was going to be my favorite CD of all time. Guess I thought wrong. This CD made me cry because I spend $11.99 on a crappy CD.People, don't get this. Please."
1,opersloger,me and my fRiends picked up this new britney cd and britney sold out i totally hated it! it was more like oops did i produce a bad record again oops you did! never ever produce another record britney then i might actually like you !!
1,WHY????,"I prayed that Brit's wouldn't make it into my house, but alas!, my mislead brother has purchased it. I asked him how it was, and all he could say was ""she's hot"". Perhaps Brit has changed, I try to reason, as I popped ""Oops, I Did It Again"" into my cd player. It couldn't possibly be as bad as ""Baby, One More Time"", her debut cd. I wanted to give her a chance. How could this be?? OIDIA! is actually WORSE than BOMT! As my friend below has stated, Brit has blantantly and unabashedly raped and violated the pop music scene with such mutilated tracks as ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" and ""Don't Go Knockin' On My Door"", not to mention the poorly covered ""Satisfaction"". Yes, Britney may be a teen who is sweet, beautiful and even ""innocent"", but we all can clearly see that talent that NOTHING to do with her success."
3,It's not the best,"I bought this CD cause i really liked the last one, but this one is not very good. All of her songs sound the same!! Which makes the whole CD very very boring. There are some songs i like,like Lucky and Oops I did it again, but now those songs are so old it's not even funny. There is no way I would recomend this CD to anyone, because I promise you you will get tired of it sooner or later. Every song gets old and boring, and I think that you will fibd that out as soon as you throw away your money on this CD."
1,Horrible.,Save your money and treat yourself to a case of your favorite soda instead. You'll be more satisfied.
4,Britney Fan,"A more mature Britney. The title track ""Oops!.. I did it again"" is my favorite song. I like this CD better than her first album ...""baby one more time""."
2,Wait to show off that nasal cavity!,"I can't believe the lows the music world has sunk to! I swear you can sing ""Baby one more time' along with at least three songs on the album including ""Oops"". I think she should sue herself for plagurism. The only thing that has gotten better then the first album is her ability to sing through her nose. The songs off the first album I could tolerate when they were on the radio but I have to change the channel instead of listening to ""oops"". At least the commercials don't grate on my nerves. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the version of ""Satisfaction"" was actually ok, just a little long."
4,Good Could be better but enjoyable,"this cd has music to dance to, music to sing to. basically for pop fans its great. other then ""satisfaction"" the cd is quite well done. for those of you that think that britney has no singing ability she proves her real voice in songs such as ""where are you now"" and ""dont let me be the last to know"" and ""one kiss from you"" this cd sends a good message to young girls and really people of any age such as in ""stronger"" when the phrase 'now its nothing but my way' and ""what you see is what you get"" also sends a good message. although some of the songs seem flaky they are good to dance to or sing to for a party for anything really. this is one of the most versatile cds ive listened to in a while. in her next cd perhaps Britney will add more slow vocal performances. When i heard Britney perform ""dont let me be the last to know"" live i knew she had talent she just hasnt showed yet. As far as this cd goes its very good, for all music lovers this is a great album."
2,For the giggly teeny bopper...,"Much thanks to Max Martin, who wrote almost all of the songs for her. I actually like Britney Spears' music, but it is really the folks behind Britney that make this happen. The only song she helped out with (she gave them the idea, they wrote the song), is a weak prayer for what she can do. She giggles with her friends in between songs about a boy that is looking at her, but she is scared to talk to him. Give me a break. It's embarrassing to listen to this one. Britney doesn't have much talent, but she does look good!"
3,"not bad, but nothing special","firstly, this album sounds a lot more mature than her first one. the songs have more meaning, but she didn't write them except for the last one so... the album isn't too bad. The beats are pretty cool and a lot better than christina's and mandy moores efforts. the best songs are oops!..., when your eyes say it, but all the songs are listenable. It's not exactly a classic album though."
1,This CD is garbage!,"The first album by Britney, which opened the Pandora's Box of similar manufactured MTV and untalented windbags. Britney is the first in a long string of artists that are more marketing than real talent. Her songs are all written by professional songwriters for mass consumption, and are soulless and void of any real meaning.Instead of teenybopper albums like this, dear readers of Amazon, I implore you to support REAL AND TALENTED ARTISTS who write their own music and put their hearts and souls into what they do, not this waste of plastic called ""music."""
1,"Yeah, Oops she did it again!","I'll start off by saying that Britney Spears has no talet as a singer. So why bother listening to someone if they can't even sing! The songs on this C.D. are either sappy, or just plain stupid. Plus, they all sound the same. If you want to buy this C.D. to use as a coaster, then please, be my guest, but don't buy this C.D. thinking that it will have good music."
4,Wowzers,"Well, this CD was great. It sounded terrific. It sounded neat. But it doens't have as much good songs like in her first CD. Although most of the songs are so easy to learn. And lots of the songs easily get stuck in your head. But the song I really love is #7. Lucky. Britney's voice sounds kinda weird in this CD, but it still makes great notes for the songs. The song Oops! I Did It Again, is maybe the best sung song in there, but I could be wrong since everyone is titled to their own opinions. Well, what i am trying to say is: Buy it. Listen to it. You will really enjoy it."
1,Oops...BUY SOMETHING ELSE!,"ack! this CD TOTALLY shows that she has NO VOICE whatsoever. i mean, HELLO! Dear Diary, i met a totally bad CD today. she can't sing, write, and is a ditz. if u want to hear some people that have REAL talent, listen for Mandy Moore (5 stars), Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, or NSYNC."
2,Could Have Been Better,"Everybody says her voice & the music has matured. The only thing that has is the music. And that's only a little bit. Her vocal ablity has not mature at all. Just because the songs are more catchy,does not mean she has matured as an artist. Her & the songs lack a great deal. Other than the fact that her songs have got more uptempo it sound like the first CD. Don't get me wrong I am not saying she has no talent,it just not as impressive as other artists. As far as being enjoyable it is probably 5 on a scale of 1-10. If you like pure pop you'll love it, but if you like me it's okay."
2,"Ladies and gentlemen, run, hide! BRITNEY'S BACK!","Ok, now I know at the beginning of Brit's career everyone embraced her as the new idol for young girls, but from recent appearances she looks and acts very far from that! There's been so much hype on this star that most people have felt it their duty to just buy her album to get her to shut up. The only reason that her CD is selling is for people to say to their friends ""Yeah, I have her new CD"" (come on, you know you do it!) I didn't actually buy the album, but listened to it at friends'. There are only two songs that I consider ""listener worthy"" (Stronger and Lucky). Just trust me, there's no reason to buy this if you really like good music. All in all, this big star is a big disappointment."
2,This is a little weird...,"Britney Spears...I don't really like her but after listening to her new album...I found that I liked the songs. Something weird around here though... I like the other singers' voices not Britney Spears's, and i really think she is a lousier singer than Christina Aguilera, she cannot sing ballads and that's why there are less of them this time round. Do you all agree with me? Here, many are CRAZY over her, but i think the ppl who gave Christina the 'Best New Artist' award were obviously thinking along the same lines as us... i think Britney Spears is only a pretty face and no more."
1,Absoultly horrible.,"Hopefully this bubblegum garbage will end soon. .... The music is all heavily over produced, her voice is over produced, the lyrics are horrible. She can't sing...."
1,not worth your money!!,"well thankfully i didnt buy this it was a gift from my friend and this is the worst i mean i cant stand her, she cant sing and her voice is fake like her body. anywyaz why do they call her the Queen of pop first of all she hasnt been around long enough to be called that, she dont deserve that. she needs more work. she go's from inocent little girl next door look and then she go's to slut trying to use her body for money. she represents herself like she wants to sell her body. dont buy her albums it poor work and a waste of money."
1,Oops I made a bad album,"Britney should realize she is a pop singer, not an R&B diva and her producers should find more Britney-appropriate material for her. There are maybe two OK songs on this album. After a while, her nasal, childlike vocals irk me to the point of throwing something. Act like a hooch and sing like an angel with a cold...I just don't get it!"
1,Did she have to?,"This album is perfect for those who enjoy catchy, sometimes cheesy throwaway pop music. If you want an album you can dance around like a lunatic then go for this- I particularly recommend Stronger- but if credible music is your thing, then look elsewhere. For the majority of teeny-boppers though ... this album is good. I personally didn't like it. The sound is too over produced and no offence to Britney, but at times she sounds like a strangled cat. At the end of the day though, she has become such a phenomenom that she will fade into obscurity soon- remember the Spice Girls?"
3,Baby One More Time ...... Turns To..... Oops I Did It Again!,"Well this cd,has good music tunes that would make you get up and dance. But you could tell that Britney Spears used a lot of computer technology to fix her voice while making this cd and some songs have interludes that can actually bug you after awhile. Plus this cd is like a repeat from her first album which is called Baby One More Time. If you are a truly a Britney Spears fan i would recommend this cd for you to buy. But if you really aren't that much of a Britney Spears fan like me, i would juss buy tha singles. You can save a lot of money for a better cd."
1,bad service,my cd came and the cd case was cracked it was not the original wrapping and the cd was scratched. i tried to contact the seller multiple times and they never replied do not buy from them.
1,1 star is too many,"My sister, a former Britney fan, is beginning to tire of her music, thank God! This album is pure torture. She can't sing, she can't write, she simply wouldn't survive if she didn't do stripteases. On satisfaction, she almost sounds as bad as Mick Jagger. There is no point to this album. Oops, I think Britney put out another bad album."
4,Throw your hipster pretensions to the wind...,"Let's face it. Without music like that of Miss Spears, other ""serious"" outfits would nary sound half as good as they do. Don't tell me that you can resist boucing along to ""One Kiss from You"" or singing along with the soul-searching, hearfelt lyrics in ""Lucky"".For quick-buck pop-dreck, this is awfully catchy. Save your caustic criticisms for more worhty opponents and give in to sweet musical temptation."
1,Ugly and dumb,"Recent researches pointed that 90% of Britney's fans are cuter than her, 95% of the fans sing better than her, and 99% is under age to see that. ""She can't sing, she is just cute."" Cute?! Where, in the bonbon? Ok, but-t music is the subject. Since there's no music, let's write more on the earlier subject.Again, as we were talking..."
1,Britneys failure,I think that brits album totally sucks. for one i only did like one song out of 13!!! what a rip off! if u want it buy a single! she can do MUCH better than this junk!
4,OOPS I Like this one Especially,OK to all you people that are dissing her you have to like her more than you let on because look at that sales rank. I just want to say that this album to me is definantly one of my favorites I love it... has alot of upbeat songs with catchy toons. I got this cd when it came out my freshman year of highschool. I might also be a little bias due to the fact that I listened to it when this whole situation with this guy was going on and it has happy memmories attached to it because of the fact that it reminds me of that time. I really like it and i'm being honest i'm not going to sit and diss her as I buy her albums like the rest of you guys... If you have a problem with her image fine... but you obviously like the music because ya keep goioing out there buying her cd's. I know when noone is around u close the door and turn up Britney Spears's songs but will never admit it. I say this is a worthy purchase I'll admit it haha...
1,Oops!?...well yeah!,"i dont know why im talkin bout this peice 'o crap cd. but i heard it so i though i might review it...anyways everysong sounds the same, and its really really bad, even for pop,...she cant sing(if you havent noticed, she sounds like shes singing out her nose...and shes probably not even singing with all the computers and technology that they can do to peoples voices these days, if theyre using computers n' stuff they should at least make it sound half way better)i dont know why i even listened to this in the first place, maybe i just wanted to pick on something, but if you appriciate good music, dont buy this. and if you like to keep money for good things, dont buy this. k? do you get my point?....DONT BUY THIS!!!"
5,Britney Brings it Again!,"Much like her debut album, ""Oops! I Did it Again!"" features catchy, poppy songs that will keep you singin' through the night. Britney has grown a little, however, and the love songs are not as sappy. Includes a cool picture of Britney's car, as well as nice pictures of Brit herself.Oops! I Did it Again-5/5Stronger-5/5Don't go Knockin' on my Door-3/5I Can't Get no Satisfaction-4/5Don't Let me be the Last to Know-4/5What U See is What U Get-5/5Lucky-5/5One Kiss From You-4/5Where are you Now-3/5Can't Make you Love me-5/5When Your Eyes Say it-4/5Dear Diary-1/5AVERAGE RATING-5/5"
4,Pretty Good!,"I like oops..i did it again, what u see is what u get, and a coupel of other songs. Britney did a good job. Dear Diary was the most boring song I have ever heard! Stronger was a rockin' song! This cd would be good to play at a party!"
1,"No more, please Britney","I don't hate Britney, honestly, but why settle for recycled garbage when there is so much better music out there. It isn't just that her songs are annoying, they lack substance. In essence, they have nothing to say. Why listen to it if you can't gain anything from it?"
2,OH NO! Not again...,"O.K. for one to produce a sucessful follow-up to their originalalbum, it must come with a new sound that improves upon the original.And Brit, I'm sorry to say that you weren't even remotely close on this one. Normally, I am a big fan of Ms. Spears, and I will continue to be, assuming that she can improve upon this horrendous effort to create an entire C.D. that basically sounds like ""Crazy"" but just with different words. Granted, there was the occassional spot of greatness in songs such as ""When Your Eyes Say It"" and ""Stronger"" all I ask is ""BRINEY WHY CANT ALL YOUR SONGS BE LIKE THOSE?"" I mean if she could come up with something original for those two tracks, then why not for the rest of the album, did she run out of ideas? I'm not going to criticize Britney herself, as she is a great talent, with great vocals, but this C.D. seemed more of an attempt to elevate her already astronomical status of teen pop queen. But Brit, it's O.K. everyone makes mistakes."
1,Ugh,"My young daughter bought this CD with money she got for her birthday. What's with all the cutesy boyfriend talk before half her songs? Her cover of ""satisfaction"" is awful, and it sounds like she used the same midi tracks in the instrumental backups to all her songs. In the first few songs I can her the obvious digital enhancement of her voice, too. Is it that easy to get into the pop business? I remember way back when - when musicians had to have *talent* to get in the business!"
1,Oops! She blew it again!,"I can't even begin to say what this album is. These songs made me sick after hearing them for just a short time. Britney sounds like a chipmunk. In other words, HORRIBLE! I used to be a fan, but this is the worst CD that I own! Don't buy this!"
3,My Review,"Classics (expect to hear these on the radio for years to come): Oops!...I Did It Again.Flavor Of The Week Hits (don't expect to hear it again once the single after it is released): Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, Lucky.Should-have-been-hits: All the hit-worthy songs on here became hits.Never-should-have-been-created crap: When Your Eyes Say It. There are more, I'm sure."
4,She did it again... and better,"Other than her lead off single ""Baby One More Time,"" I didn't like Spiers' first CD at all. So why did I buy the new one? Media hype, good reviews, and a infectious new single (""Ooops... I Did It Again). And guess what? Spiers' new sexy attitude and sexier growl have won me over. The first five songs are delicious slices of pop perfection, and her cover of the Stones' ""Satisfaction"" is a creative kiss off to her detractors. The rest of the album is hit and miss (""Dear Diary"" is pure drivel -- teenage girls will love it). But this new CD is quite an accomplishment for Ms. Spiers and her Europop producers. Turning 18 is the best thing that ever happened to Brittany. Her music is maturing. Can't wait to hear from her at 21."
3,"Worse than the first, but OK","I loved Britney's first album. She was really putting some emotion into her music. Her new cd should have been the same. But, good things don't last forever. In this cd, I felt she sounded fake. She was just singing the words that were givin to her by her writer. This year Britney has been really disappointing. It seems as if all she cares about is her looks. The songs were nice, but she could've sang much better."
1,Bubble Gum Flop!,This is a disapointing CD. She has poor vocal skills. The 1st CD was much better. Britney is a not to good singer. The songs are really bad. There are some good songs on here. I would expect better from her. People just buy this CD because she looks good. I don't think she is recongized for her singing or her vocal skills.
2,um....she DIDN'T do it,"I have to admit, this CD isn't as good as I thought it would be. It's MUCH better than the other on, ...baby one more time, but some of the songs are just really babyish although she states it's got a mature theme. I don't think so. And she talks in the songs. Most of the songs are talking about how great she is, like Oops I did it again, it sounds like she's really great and so all these guys come after her, and she dumps all of them again and again. All the songs are very concieted and immature. This is just my opinion, and if you think that's great, that's fine. I didn't rate it a 1 stars, because i have to admit the improvement from last time."
3,Better Than Last Time,"When Britney's first cd came out I wasn't a big fan of hers. I even hated some of her songs. I thought she was just another teen pop star who had no talent. But, when I heard this new cd, I changed my perspective. It sounds like she has more freedom with her songs and is confident with herself. Her songs have gotten a lot better. The lyrics are more mature and the songs have more of a beat to them. Even though this cd isn't the best, I would give it 3 stars. ""Lucky"" is the best song on the cd.Britney still has a way to go, but she is on her way."
1,just bad,"I heard the album at my friends house. As a rolling stones fan, I was disgusted by the way she butchered ""Satisfaction."" I am a 15 year old girl and I am extremely insulted by the idea that people think that girls only like teen pop. It is meaningless. Listen to Bob Dylan or Jimi Hendrix instead."
1,Oops...Please Don't Tell Me She's Done It Again,"If you're looking for a CD with musical value, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a glittered up, famous-because-of-her-stomach teen queen, stop right here. In fact, never mind--don't, because there are other doll-faced singers that in fact can sing, such as Christina Aguilera. Britney's songs are simple and sickeningly catchy providing the listener with an unsure and unfulfilled feeling. Her voice is undeveloped and whiny leaving the toleration level at about three songs or less. It's sad that a multi-platinum career can be made from looks and promotion."
1,Oops! She shoudn't do it again......,"I give this CD 1 star, I would have given it a zero if it was possible. This album is was horrible but it was better than the first one which tells you that the first one was worse. The girl just can't sing which goes to show that you don't have to have talent to make it in the music business. She needs to leave the high notes to people like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. The whole CD was a remake of her first one with different words set to the same beat. If Britney wants to be around in the long run like her idol Madonna then she needs to come up with better music otherwise she is going to die fast, and her fan base is going to dwindle because the kids who are buying her music now are going to grow up and their tastes are gonna change. Five years from now we'll all ask the same question, Whatever happened to Britney Spears? I hope she is saving her money for the future."
1,Total masterpiece- I think not...,"Wow! I really thought that Britney wouldn't be able to top her first album, but just look at this, she did it! I really just love the way she totally and completely ruined classics like Satisfaction (I can't get no) by surrendering them to the shallow, superficial beat of pop music. And speaking of beats Britney-get some new ones. There are only so many times that u can put different lyrics to the same basic beat. I was given this album as a gift. My poor misguided aunt thought that I might like the ""rolemodel""/sex icon's music. I consider this album to be a total waste of money."
4,Great work...,"I really enjoy this CD. It is so much better than the Baby one more time CD. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first CD, but I just like this one better. It's much more upbeat, the lyrics are better and you can tell that Britney has grown. I love Britney, I think she is great and I will continue to enjoy her music. But don't listen to me or anyone else, check it out yourself... There are SO many different oppinions on Britney, so you can only really trust your own..."
3,Ug!,"When I bought this proudut I was so exited! Then I found this CD a ripp off.Sure it had some few good songs like Oop...I did it again and Dear Diary,then the other really stinked.Boo for Britney! And Britney?Do me a favor.Please dont ripp off other yonger fans like age of 6` to 9. Their moths of saving is going down the drain!"
2,"Oops, she DID do it again!","She can dance and perhaps sing, but she's only for serious fans of teen pop."
4,Awesome,"I never really liked Britney Spears until someone let me borrow her C-D. I thought she sang great, but some songs were on the slow side.Besides that, the C-D was good, but I still like Christina Aguleria better."
3,Not bad for a second album,"Oops, I Did It Again is probably the best song on this cd. There are a few other songs that are really good. One is called What You See Is What You Get. This song is really saying that if you don't like me for who I am then get lost. That you shouldn't try to change someone because that's not why you like them. The other songs that I like are Lucky, Where Are You Now, and Dear Diary. I don't know if this will help you or not. But if your a fan then I saw go for it."
5,THE BEST!,"This CD is ten times better than her first one. The songs are totally different and they are so much cooler than the first ones. Britney CAN sing so everyone stop saying that a computer makes her voice better. Did you see her on MTV? These songs are so cool, if you loved the first album, you'll worship this one, if you hated the first album, buy this one b/c you will love it!"
1,"YES, AGAIN ...","She did it again .. released an inocuous and empty ""pop"" album and made huge money, in the better style of SPICE GIRLS, BACKSTREET BOYS and other market genius around the world .. It's sad people fall for it."
1,If i could rate a zero. I would.,Someone needs to teach Britney how to sing. Her songs are really bubblegum songs for her bubble gum fans. I wouldn't waste a penny on her album even if it was worth that much. It should be worth that much.
1,Ouch!...,"Scary how much the title track sounds like her first album. I'm so tired of hearing love and relationships rationalized into bubblegum melodies (I grew up in the age of New Kids...can't help that). Musically, this album pretty much stinks. Is there anything more to music (esp. pop) that has nothing to do with electronic beats and computerized music? I made the mistake of buying this cd... By the way I'm 22 years old, and not 50, so I know plenty about the bubblegum. Chao!"
2,Oops-Did I Spend Money On This?,"Even Britney's weak Baby One More Time CD sounds better than Brittney's sopomore album. I was very, very disappointed with this CD. The songs were weak and lacking in everythimg-vocals, lyrics, rythem...most of them aren't the slightest bit catchy! I bought the CD for the famed ""Oops I Did It Again"", and am now heartily sorry I wasted my money. . ."
1,Is this real?,"I think that Britney is a very fake singer and what is withthat cover. She [is really bad], just face it.I think that they just used her because of her looks. If she could get in to that pop buisness then I bet anyone could. At least Christina is a hack of a lot better. She is actually real unlike Britney. This sucks. The only song on here that makes me happy is Dear Diary because I can relate to some stuff she says but she isn't real. If you like christina don't buy this. She seems like she has the same music for all of her songs and it is all boring."
1,PROPAGANDA,"Britney is the true meaning of propaganda. She is always on TV, radio, and magazines selling the wrong thing. Britney Spears is just as bad as the local drug dealer. Just like the local drug she is pumping truck load of smack into the youth of America. I am also 18 and I can say that I have more on my mind than just boys and needing love from a boy. Come on when are teen performers going to start to helping the youth to over come things like teen pregnancy, killing on school grounds, not getting a education, self esteem, and etc. Not all teens are shallow. And now on the music note the girl can not sing live or studio. I don't care who tells me she can sing, they're lying. The songs on both of her albums are bad and sick. And if people really need some good bad a** pop/r&b/rock/whatever buy Janet Jackson for power."
1,Oops- She Did It Again and you bought it!,"This has to be the worst CD I ever listened to! Someone in my family bought this CD and was nice enough to let me take a listen. It hurt my head! Like her first CD, there is too much of something. Unlike her last Cd, which had nothing to make me want to dance, this has too much hard edge! Britney, you may have shot to the top, but try something else! There's more then your soda-pop and rock n' roll image. Belive me, this CD is not a number 1 in my book. Maybe next time, but for now, this is a real OOPS, SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN!"
5,This cd was no Oops!,"Wow, I knew that this album was going to be good but it's much better than I had hoped! You can certainly tell that Britney has grown not only as a person but as an artist! It's just a good all around cd. I am certainly glad that I bought it...you should too if you haven't already!"
4,"For those about to pop, we salute you.","Don't tell anyone, but I have a real soft spot for sugar coated teen pop, so it was with great anticipation that I awaited the second opus from the reigning monarch of melody, Britney Spears. Overcome your musical racism, folks, this is a great album. Her first effort was, singles aside, a bit thin - but second time around Ms. Spears packs many zippy little numbers into her alotted 48 minutes. The first listen is a bit of a strain, but a few spins later and you'll find an armful of winners shining through. The title track rocks (naturally), as does What You See (Is What You Get) and the Backstreet Boys knock-off, Stronger. However, this listener favors Lucky, a perky ditty that guarantees a spot of the old toe-tapping. Well done, Britney."
1,A Telling Portrait of How Over-Produced Popular Music Is,"Britney Spears is not a talented singer. Truth be told, the above album attempts to cover this up with the latest in technology - space-aged technology. But no amount of Pro Tools reverb can cover up this simple fact: talentless dribble will not last the test of time and become part of the next Time-Life music anthology."
2,Eh..for 12 year olds,"Britney can dance, but shes not much at picking out someone to mix her CD's. This new CD is over mixed and all the songs have the EXACT same beat, even the slow songs. The only good songs on the CD have already been released and are all over MTV. She can dance, got to give her that. But next time Britney, have someone else mix the album."
2,If I knew how to grimace on the Internet...,"I used to love Britney Spears. Her songs are, well, were, wholesome, sweet and lighthearted stuff kids could enjoy without having to fight with their parents everytime they put this on. When ""OOps"" came out, I was so excited. After I heard the title track, I tried to remain excited, but I was lying to myself. I don't like this CD. Try as I might, Britney Spears will always be nothing more than a product- much like the Pepsi-Cola she's endorsing now to make even more money off of us. (Bob Dole A.K.A. Mr. E.D. at the end is REALLY sickening.) Her only good song ""Lucky"" and semi-bearable song ""What U See"" are not reason enough to waste money on this. (Money that goes to a person who, by the way, won't even sign autographs for her fans.) After three years of the ""pop princess""'s domain, I think it's time for her to abdicate to someone more deserving."
5,Step up for Britney,"This album is definitely a step up from ""...Baby One More Time."" It's obvious that Britney's grown, and is no longer singing about ""Soda Pop."" She knows she's hot, and she displays it in every song on this album. Whoops, she did it again, she made another album w/several #1 singles! Luck? I think not..."
2,Slightly better than first album,"OK, Ms. Spears' sophomore effort is slightly better than her debut album. The lyrics are more mature, yes, but it doesn't change the fact that Britney's horrible voice totally drags down the songs. The listenable ones are #1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. The rest are bad. Period. Ms. Spears also still dresses like a skeezer (this year's VMAs for example), and obviously thinks that she's a sex goddess. She is gorgeous, yes, but she's not a good singer. I still say Christina is far better."
4,THIS CD IS FUN!,"I know a lot of people think Britney really sucks. And I have to say, she doesn't write any of her own songs (well, one REALLY bad one) but this CD is fun. She really is a good singer. Her vocal scale may not be up there with Mariah Carey, but she really does have a beautiful voice. If you're looking for a serious or really good CD, WHY ARE YOU HERE? Britney Spears is not about that. She is about sex appeal and FUN music. And I admit- this CD definately DOES have a few low points (like hmm... DEAR DIARY-the WORST song in the world). But most CDS do! If you pay attention to the better songs, like Oops and Lucky, this CD really is pretty good!"
1,She did it again - what more need we say?,"Being in the teenaged crowd, I have already heard this album ten times over even though I do not own it myself. It is absolutely nothing new or original, just the same glossed-over pop, plus an insulting rendition of ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction."" Britney Spears has done it before, and people have bought it, and now it seems the mindless teen population is falling for it again. If you want to listen to some pop that's actually really good and imaginative, try the lesser known Japanese group's first american album ""Dreams Come True."" Britney's sound is the same old trash."
1,very very dissappointing,I knew that this was going to be a very very bad album from the first moment i heard OOps i did it ageain. The first album was way better but what can i say she is going in the wrong direction.
2,She's cute but can't sing,"I've been reading many of the reviews and I appreciate the difficulty of writing an unbiased one. But I'll try anyway. The fact that Britney does not write her own songs does not bother me as much as her blatant use of sex appeal to gather an audience for her superficial songs. I'm strongly inclined to believe that her music video of Oops...I did it again played a strong role in promoting her newest album. I'm not saying that sex appeal is wrong; on the contrary, many notable artists are able to use it skillfully to add color to their more sensuous song. But seeing someone as young as Britney attempting to reach out to a male audience by using premature sexuality with her tongue and body language is just disgusting."
5,best britney,"Dis is a really good album. Sure, she shows her belly, but really, she glides!! Cherish dis becuz dis is da last time Britney will ever use her REAL shining talent."
3,Not 2 bad,"Britney Spears's CD isn't all that, like I've heard. Personally, I'm getting pretty tired of that song ""Oops!...I did it again"". What kind of a song is this? Is this even qualified to BE a song? Every time you turn on a radio you hear that annoying sound. And... what's UP with that music video I saw on TV? It's disgusting, trying to make it look like she's ""Not that innocent,"" when all along she's supposed to be this innocent lil' school girl. To tell the truth, I don't own the CD. I didn't want it because it would be a waste when I only like ONE song of the whole album. So.. I bought a single, and I'm happy with that. I put three stars because it's not a terrible CD, it's just.... annoying. I'll end this review with one more thought of mine. I can't tell you not to buy the CD, and I shouldn't. But if I were you, I'd buy the single."
3,Failed attempt at growing up.,"This cd, to most people, would be a new chance for them to listen to their young pop star, Britney Spears. Yet, this album is not like the ""Baby one..."" Britney. Not like the Britney that brought us a new type of way to listen to great music. This cd sounds like a failed attempt at growing up. Althougt this album may sound like a hit, but ""Oops.."" can't compare to ""Baby one..."" on the pleasure-to-ear chart. She made a mistake many artist in their primes made---grow up too soon. Her entire approach to music changed with this album. Buying it or not is your choice, but to be on the safe side, don't. It would be a miracle for it to bring as much reat music that her self-titled brought me."
2,FROM A 13 YEAR OLD MUSIC FAN.....,"Okay , I'll be honest, this cd isn't as bad as her 1st one , but it still has some of the most sillest , most laughable music I have ever heard in all my 13 years of life!!! First of all the song's suck anyway, but adding Britney's very untalented chipmunk voice makes them even worse.... It makes me sick to see all these people buy her cds and give this girl all this money. When she doesn't even do half the work that a hard-working , talent artist would do. She doesn't even write her own songs and has the nerve to call them ""my music"". Britney is probley more worried about how she looks when she gets up in the morning , than she is about getting voice lessons (whice she so despretly needs!) or figureing out to be taken more seriously ( sluttey clothes and stupid pop-tart bubblegum music, PLEASE!!) So unless your a fan of crap like this don't buy this cd!!!"
1,POP TART,"Plastic headed Britney is what we call a Pop Tart. She's got looks, but her music is trite and she can't even sing for her supper. I absolutely hate her ""Baby, One More Time"" and I haven't heard anything else that I like by her. I'd rather hear bulldozers than Britney. Britney doesn't sound half as good as my friend's basset hound, Dixie. When Dixie throws back her head and bays, she keeps better time and sounds better than Britney ever did. Tell Britney to leave singing to the big girls like Mariah Carey and Selena. They are real talents."
2,Limited Audience,"Britney Spears is oh so over hyped. Her musical vision for the most part is oh so limited to 10-15 year olds.There are a few creative twists here and there with Britney rapping with her friends. The beat is pretty cool but certainly gets stale after a while. And the lyrics are oh so juvenile. I like the opening track and a few other songs are decent. However, the artifical unoriginal musical arrangment makes the impression tolerable at best."
2,Oops!... I Did It Again,1. Oops! I Did It Again 1/52. Stronger 5/53. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door 1/54. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction 1/55. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know 1/56. What U See (Is What You Get) 1/57. Lucky 5/58. One Kiss From You 5/59. Where Are You Now 4/510. Can't Make You Love Me 3/511. When Your Eyes Say It 1/512. Girl In The Mirror 2/513. You Got It All 3/514. Heart 2/515. Dear Diary 1/5
5,Hate me if you must....,"....But I absolutely love this Cd! 'Oops!...I Did It Again' is Britney's sophomore effort. I have to say that it's pretty darn' good. Sure, most of the songs sound the same...but no artist likes to try and vary their sounds TOO much (unless you're from *N Sync) because then you have no ""sound of your own"" and the Cd just sounds all messed up. You may say things like, ""Oh, Britney can't sing!"" and, ""This is just manufactured pop!"". But so what? As long as you think the music is catchy and enjoy it, it shouldn't matter that she's no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey. >Britney may have turned into a ""sex symbol"" and she may lip sync while performing live, but she's still a pretty good artist with awesome pop songs. If you love pop music then I totally recommend this Cd. Buy it today."
3,Alright...,"This album was not as good as 'Baby'. The chunes aren't as catchy but are still pretty good. Songs like 'Oops, I did it again' and 'I can't get no satisfaction' show that the cute little Teeniebopper we once knew and loved as grown up! Heres a track guide to help all you fans out there...1. Oops I did it again - Jumpy, mature and cheeky!2. Stronger - Rock come pop!3. Don't go Knocking on my door - R n B sounding.4. Can't get no... - Again mature and 'grown up'5. Don't let me be... - Slow, Sexy ballad6. What u see - Dancy and Strong!7. Lucky - Pop, pop and pop!8. One Kiss - Yawn this is getting boring!9. Where r u - Another ballad10. I'm just a girl - Strong and bouncy, kinda catchy!11. Girl in the mirror - Next?12. Dear Diary - Brits Song..."
3,Only worth it for tracks 1 to 7,"I'm not too fond of Britney's voice, but I couldn't help liking Oops, Stronger and Satisfaction, so I just had to buy this CD, and it wasn't the best. You could tell there is some growth from the last CD. This album is only worth it for tracks 1 to 7, everything else is a filler. The catchy Dear Diary at the end has a nice tune, but Brit wrote the lyrics, and my little sister can write better than that. If you want to hear awesome music, try N Sync, Destiny's Child and Janet."
4,Lets be Nice...,"Okay! This album is not as good as baby, but i still think shes doin alright. To all the people who are saying oh i hate this album and i only got it for fun, grow up! Its obivious that you liked it and her! The best songs are Oops I did it again and Don't go knockin on my door. Shes not very good at the ballads though and i think she should stick to what she knows best! I personally have nothing against the girl and i think you should give this album a try. Who knows, you might even enjoy it...!"
3,So/So,"Okay, I definetly can't give Britney a 1 because the albums not THAT horrible, i mean if it can sell around (12 million, was it?) CDs, then it can't be that bad, but really, some of the songs on the album are actually pretty good, like Lucky. But then again, I can't give her a 5 because like someone before me put, a lot of the songs *do* sound the same, so ill just give her a 3, smack in the middle, its not too horrible, but its not he best album out there either! :)"
2,Need a new synthisizer!,"Britney's singing voice is really terrific, but again her album sounds very much like a broken record, all the same background music. Take it from groups like the Eagles, Fleetwood Mack, Belinda Carlyle, etc, mix up the sounds and every song will not sound identical. After the third song, I was so sick of that stuipid repetitive background beat, I turned the CD off and gave it to the 13 year old girl next door. You said on your Disney interview that you wanted to move into more adult sounds, this is definately not the way to do it! Sorry."
5,THIS IS THE BEST EVA DISK,"well it is i has all u need all of the songs a brilliant and i recomend u buy it if u have the next album ""britney"" or the previous album ""baby one MOre time"" and this is a really brilliant cd i recomend u buy it as soon as u have the muney it u don't have it alreadythe best track on this cd is""where are you now"" it's just so amazin' very realateble and brilliant one of my all time favourite albums :Dluv and lightHILDELBRIT"
5,Oops...Another Hit!,"Britney's new CD is a great buy. If you liked her first, you'll love her second! Besides the great single ""Oops...I Did It Again"", Britney has a great selection, my favorites being ""Lucky"" and ""What U See (Is What U Get)"". Great album!"
2,"it's no ""Baby One More Time""","Britney has grown up, for sure. Her songs are more mature and worldly wise, but the upbeat pop sound is gone. None of the songs ever take off, and her rendition of the Stones' ""Satisfaction"" is blasphemy. It's good to hear her again, but don't believe the hype. This is a sophomore slump and she will have to retool for a comeback next time."
4,The BOMB!,"Britney has just outdone herself w/this one! This CD is a must have...its just....the BOMB! Even if you only usually listen to Hip Hop/R&B you will love this! Although the whole CD is tight, the best songs are(in my opinion): Oops, I Did It Again, Strong, Don't Go Knocking On My Door, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know & What You See."
3,Not a bad sophmore!,"This CD was not that bad. I mean- most of the songs still have that *crazy* and *from the bottom of my broken heart* sound, but if you like self expression on problems we all face up to and those guy problems that just wont go away and ya like britany than by all means get this cute cd!"
2,Where's the talent?,"Well, gosh, folks, it may be catchy and it may want to you make to dance, but ya know what? It would be twice as good if she could sing. Her inane growl and numerous (to the point of being uncountable) vocal hiccups detract from any appeal the songs may have had. I have nothing against, the girl, I'm sure she's very nice, and of course she's pretty, but that doesn't mean she should be riding to stardom on a FAR below par voice."
4,Lots of Attitude and Sass,"This CD really proves that Britney has matured since her debut album. There is a lot of attitude and sass in this album that was missing from a lot of the songs in the first album. Britney has an amazing voice which really makes the album hers. I love this CD but if you listen to it repeatdly over and over again, it can start to get annoying. Save the pleasure of listening to the album once or twice a day at maximum."
3,Britney...again,"Once again Britney has popped onto the music scene with her new album 'Oops I did it again' Filled with the normal love songs and heavy beat angry girl songs this album is just about the other one except I believe worse. In her new single 'Oops I did it again' there is a horrible section in it when Britney charms us with her WONDERFUL acting abilities with a horrible skit between her and an astronaut, although by just listening you would think it was straight out of Titanic. Well if you go for the bubble gum acts then you will probably enjoy this CD but don't expect to be surprised."
5,Brilliantly Stunning Britney does it again!,Britney's Sophmore album has shown how much her music has matured. I think she is the queen of Pop and deserves all of the credit she gets!
3,Nothing new...,"Sure the song has a catchy beat to it but that's really all there is. There's really no thought put into the lyrics. ""Oops...I did it again""...very poetic...this is just one more song to feed to the teenyboppers. There are a lot of girls coming up behind Britney and I think she'll be fading behind them in no time. This song is great is you're looking for meaningless music."
1,"oops, I almost listened to it","What's the difference between Britney Spears and a dog's rubber chew toy? Answer...one of them makes loud annoying squeaky sounds, and the other is a rubber chew toy."
5,Pop at its best,"Britney did a phenomenal job with this one folks, it is truely awesome. There aren't as many sappy ballads, and the ones that are there are awesome. My favorite fast songs are Oops (of course), Stronger, What U See (is What U get), and Can't make U love me. My favorite slow songs are Lucky, Don't Let Me be the last to know, Where are you now (great vocals here). 5 stars all the way! Britney rules."
2,TWO WORDS- OVER RATED!,"i expected soooooo much better! this cd is ok, nothing special. i dont recommend this cd. this cd and her first cd sound the same to me"
1,Nooooooooooo!,"I like Britney Spears but she didn't do it again. The only way this album would be good is if it were emo like Baby One More Time. But it's not. Lucky is not emo in the least, it's pseudo-emo, sort of like Knapsack. There's noooooo emo! Don't buy it! Buy New Found Glory! EMOOOOOOOOOO!"
1,Auuuuuuuuuggghhhhhh!,"Oops, she did it again. She insulted the intelligence of every man, woman, and child on this earth by thinking that this ""music"" (which she doesn't even write) is something that we should spend thirteen dollars on. If you are a young male and are attracted to her, by all means, go out and buy posters and save yourself the money on this music. If you're a young woman and like her voice (which would imply to me that you haven't heard the plethora of woman musicians out there) may I suggest something like the Indego Girls, not that I am an Indego girls fanatic, but you would hear a different style (and in my opinion, much deeper development) of the female voice. And if you just like the upbeat and bubble-gum-poppy nature of her songs, well, then God bless."
5,Oops! World's Best CD by Accident!,Yep. The Best CD anythng can buy. Britney 's outdone herself producng this CD. Featurng great tracs. Oops! Stronger Lucky Dont Let Me Be The Last to Know and more. BUY IT!Remember... You heard it here from Britney's biggest fan right here. ~Ashley
1,"I can't get no satisfaction with this ""album""","I can't believe that there are some people out there thinking that she wrote the song ""(I can't get no) Satisfaction"". This Rolling Stones' masterpiece doesn't deserve this absurd remake. Boring and stupid ""album""."
2,An average album.,"This album is better that Spears's debut, but there still is nothing that great about it. The only songs that I listen to are ""Stronger"" and ""(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction""."
3,A good sophomore album,"This album in my opinion is a little better than her first one. The songs that really stand out are ""oops..I did it again"", ""stronger"" (my personal favorite), and ""can't make you love me"". The reason why i gave it 3 stars is that the other songs are too slow for me. It's not as danceable as the three i named. But it might appeal to others. Overall the album is well organized and sounds a bit more mature than her previous. Pick one up if your a britney fan. You won't be dissappointed."
1,Brittany Spears is a Bad Role Model,"Brittany Spears is a bad role model for children all around the world. She sings through her nose and her songs are nauseating. Her clothes are inappropriate and are degrading to women around the world. She is a sex object. Oops!...I Did It Again is a song about her toying with a man. Children look up to pop stars and try to be like them. You see 4 year olds trying to ""look like Brittany."" She should respect herself enough to dress nicely and be a good role model for children. Boys need to realize all women don't look like Brittany and she doesn't help stress this fact. I think Brittany should either start acting as a better role model because although children shouldn't, they look up to Britanny because they don't know any better."
1,What a paradox,"Yes she's beautiful and I would marry her in a second, but damn. She's not a musician in the most stretched out form of the word, and hardly a good singer. At best she's an entertainer doing other people's work and taking damn near all credit for it. What happened to people writing their own music? What's that--Britney tried to write a song but it didn't turn out too good? Oh darn, let her struggle. And her voice gets annoying if I hear more than one of her songs at a time. Go get an appreciation for good music (i.e. jazz or classical or almost anything before 1980)..."
5,Actually I wanted to give it 6 stars !,It just rules. I love every single song on the album ! What more can I say. My advise ... go and buy this album ! I am more of an Eminem fan myself but if an Eminem fan likes this album then anyone would !
3,What did you expect?,"Well, it's Britney Spears. It's about as good as anyone can expect from the formulated dancer (notice I didn't give her the word ""singer"")... and in some ways to someone who really appreciates good music it can still be a damn good guilty pleasure! Songs like ""Lucky"" and ""Where Are You Now?"" Are pleasant to listen to, and if one's not in the mood for something too deep... Britney's album can be a fun CD.... I wouldn't advise taking it too seriously- but I mean, who bought this cd looking to be impressed?"
2,Big Dissapointment from first album,"I liked the first album alot, and keep in mind I'm a guy who usually listens to only heavy metal. This one however, loses just about all that made the first one good. The sweet, innocent, somewhat submissive Britney is gone, and a cruel, domineering Britney has taken her place. The title track is about a girl who loves to play with a guy's heart, breaking it again and again. It's such an evil song. The only songs I like on it are ""Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know,"" ""What you see (Is what you get),"" and ""Lucky."" 3 good songs out of 10. ""Don't let me be the last to know"" has that sweet soulful sound that she used to possess. I guess ""Oops"" has a nice beat, but the lyrics are so cruel that I can't listen to it. Worth about 5 dollars based on those three good songs. Get the first one instead."
2,Just Not As Good As I Thought,"Following her multiplatinum debut, Britney spear's 2nd album is most anticipated by fans. I'm not a fan of hers but i bought the album cause i heard there were songs by Diane Warren and Shania Twain. Sadly, there's little in here that i can praise, it's just that most of the songs are not that memorable. Also some of the songs sound recycled from her first album.But to give credit where credit is due, Britney sounds affecting on the last track, Dear Diary which she co-wrote and that one was touching.Hopefully, a more matured Britney in the future will put out stronger material and hone her voice to greater heights."
3,A mom's point of view,"My daughter and her friends can not get enough of Britney! I actually prefer her first album over this one. This one is a little more ""canned"". Britney is definately giving the girls what they like to listen to - bubble gum pop. There is nothing offensive in the lyrics for parents to worry about. If your kids loved the last one - they'll love this one too."
3,Don't take this album out of context,"Stop comparing this album to Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, it's ludicrous. That's like comparing Public Enemy to Laurie Anderson. They're different sounds and different artists. I hate preprocessed boy bands just like everyone else, but this is just a pop record. A fun little pop record that you listen to when you want to just have a little fun. It's not a serious album filled with protest anthems or issues of the times. It's just a fun record that makes you want to dance when you are happy or when you need a little pick-me-up, that's all. Stop taking the album out of context and you'll see that it serves its purpose (that is, if it has any)."
5,Incredible Pop Diva,"There isn't anything that isn't perfect in this cd. She sends a good message, has a soothing voice, and is the most strikingly incredibly unbelievably hot person that I have ever seen, easily. Her songs are about friendships and relationships and all of the songs send the right message: that caring about others and concern for others defines true relationships. Her lyrics are very catchy, and original. She is a very hard worker and is very deservant of her success.... Britney is head and shoulders above christina aguilera because she is a better overall person with substantially more success.Like many others, I am obsessed with Britney, but because she is sweet and caring and extremely attractive and not for other more common reasons."
2,Oops!... She Made a Terrible Album... AGAIN,"I'm not a Britney-hater. Honest. I know she's the type of girl people love to hate. I just am being honest when I say she has absolutely no singing talent and all her music is over-manufactured. It is very obvious with every ""oh baby"" that this CD was written by a 40-year-old Swedish pop master (i.e. Max Martin.) Every song has a tried and true formula: verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse/chorus refrain/chorus x2. It gets really dull by the third track, and Ms. Spears's cover of the Rolling Stones ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" is just horrendous. Most of the songs are regurgitated pop dance tunes, but Britney throws in a few sickly ballads that she's notorious for - ""When Your Eyes Say It,"" ""Dear Diary,"" ""Don't Let Me be the Last to Know,"" and ""Where Are You Now."" The only good track is ""One Kiss From You."" That's it. This album is a waste of money and very disappointing. Ick."
1,oops i listened to this trash,please dont make the mistake of listening to this crappy album like i did at a local bar.i have been feeling sick ever since and so will you so avoid this awful babe and her cd.
1,Oops you did it again Britney,"You released another steaming pile of cow dung. Please somebody tell me im dreaming? Please tell me that manufactured sewage like this doesnt sell? Where are the musicians at? Where are the artists with original and creative ideas? Oh yeah i forgot they are all dead. So this is what becomes of music huh? Well i guess i must go back to contemplating suicide then. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this. Get music with REAL feeling and emotion. Get Marvin Gaye, Nirvana, Bob Marley, The Beatles, ANYTHING BUT THIS!!!!!!!"
1,Why do I feel like I'm hearing the same song over and over?,"ok, so I listened to my friend Kenny's Tape of this Album in his car and all I have to say is this album is so repeatitive. Seriously, when I heard ""What You see is What You Get"" I thought it was Oops I did it Again. And Dear Diary? Lmao...that song is just so funny. I guess she wrote it and the lyrics go as follows:Dear Diary, Today I saw a boy and I wondered if he noticed me he took my breath awayok, you get it. This album is awful..."
1,a pity i cant go below one star,i would strongly appeal to people who love good music to stay very far away from this terrible woman and her worthless tuneless albums please.my rating would be half a star only.
1,..........what can I say about this crap?,"ok, her first album wasn't that good. I'm kidding. The first one was a crap, too! she's been a singer(or a dancer)for about 5 yrs. and she hasn't improved at all. yeah, one thing has improved(?) that her music videos have gotten dirtier dirtier.oh, no. Britney, please stop making CRAPS!"
1,Music can really get this bad?,"I am not really sure how anyone can like this crap but if somone can find a good reason please write a review informing me. Her voice is really annoying, the lyrics are laughable and the subject matter is........ In fact I am not sure at times what she is talking about. This album is for ages 7 and under. No one else is supposed to like it and nobody else should like it. So unless you are 7 years or younger DONT BUY THIS!"
3,Typical Pop Singer,"I admit it. I like pop music. But only if the singers actually have talent, and decent lyrics, unlike Britney. Her lyrics are sappy, especially the only one she actually wrote, ""Dear Diary"" (sickeningly sweet). She has a few good songs, such as ""What U See."" However, she has a thin voice and little talent. The album is not a total waste of money, because of the couple of good songs. But all the decent songs are in the front, so the rest of the album (Songs 8, 9, 11, & 12) is just fluff. All in all, it would be better if you bought an album by a pop singer with TALENT, like Christina Aguilera or Mandy Moore."
1,BYE BYE BYE,ABOUT AS GOOD AS NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK. NO TALENT AT ALL. A STUDIO CREATION AND THE SONGS HAVE NO FEELING OR MEANING.
1,"God, it's awful","As someone already mentioned, these are some barely literate lyrics in an amlagmation of her terrible voice and god-awful pop. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Better and Better,"A great follow-up CD. Much better than her first release. Satisfaction is a surprisingly great cover of a great song. Not a bad song on the CD, although I prefer the up-tempo songs. Hot girl, hot CD."
1,Focus On The Facts!!,"While a lot of people feel it's relevant to discuss whether or not Britney has implants or uses her body to further her career, the bottom line is: SHE CAN'T SING! All the twelve-year-olds who feel that everyone who ""denies Britney's talent"" is jealous of her looks or fame are obviously just trying to defend their idol, regardless of what kind of music she puts out. Song after song on this album is repetitive and shallow garbage that was masterminded by people who have long left their teen years behind. I won't knock the girl for her sole attempt at writing a song, but how she even got a record contract is beyond me. If you want to hear the horrendous voice for yourself, my suggestion is to download a few songs (from either album, since they both sound the same) for a taste before making up your mind on whether or not you can actually tolerate listening to a full CD."
1,"Bad, really bad","I have always been a fan of ""good"" pop music, but this is so far from good it is not funny. The songs on the CD all sound alike, which makes for very boring listening. Ms. Spears vocals are far from good, she looks like she still belongs on the Mickey Mouse Club when she is compared to Celine Dion, Christina Aguillera, and Jennifer Simpson. If you were a fan of Ms. Spears debut release then you might enjoy this dud, if you are not don't waste your money."
1,Oh Dear God,"Hopefully Britney Spears and all of the other bubblegum pop acts will disappear in the next few years (how about in the next few days) but that isn't likely to happen (of course my predictions are always wrong). I don't expect an 11-year-old to listen to music with any meaning, so they're off the hook. As for the rest of you, there is no hope if you're spending your days listening to this talentless Madonna wannabe (and it's not like Madonna is a great singer either, but at least and co-writes and co-produces her own material). Oh and I can hardly wait for her acting career. But then again, her music career is already an act."
2,Oops!..she REALLY did it again!,"The answer is yes. She really did manage to make this cd as bad as the first. Sure; there are one or two ""good"" songs but overall, this cd stinks. Britney's fake image (and other parts) is what teenage girls look up to? She may have a voice...but no one said that voice was good. If you're looking for song reviews; ""Lucky"" and the title song, ""Oops!..I did it again"", have very catchy beats and lyrics. ""Satisfaction"" is a over-sexed song using ""uh"" between every ""I can't get no"" and ""satisfaction"". Just my imagination or does Britney really want more than just fame?"
1,No stars if possible!,"Thanks to the wonderful sources of the internet, I was able to listen to the whole cd of Britney Spears sohpmore album a month before it's release date, May 16th. All the songs are nothing but artificial fluff and no depth whatsoever. Her debut album is SO much better than this one. Her version of ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction"" is an insult to the Rolling Stones. There isn't anything mature about this album, she's trying to maintain her audience of youngsters to the adolescent years. ""Dear Diary"" is just as cheesy as ""Email My Heart."" Her voice sounds EXACTLY the same as the last album, in which she recorded the songs when she was 15/16... we all know it's studio enchanced, her real voice is very raspy and deep. Save some good money and don't buy this album, even if you DO want to look at those eye catching photographs in the cd case!"
4,Improvement on Debut,"Britney definitley improves on her second effort, more catchy tunes, but over-oooozed with ballads, Very cool though. Songs like ""Oops!"",""Lucky"",""Dont let me be the..."",""One Kiss From You"", And ""STRONGER""!! AND ""Dont go knokin' on my door"", and ""[I cant get no] Satisfaction"" Proves this isnt a cheese-fest! This album rocks and Britney rocks Isnt as good as some of her works down the road but it is definitley a highlight, I mean Who DOSENT know the song ""Oops! I did It Again!"" This is a highlight of her career, though I think ""Toxic"" Is getting more attention!. I truly think this is a vaaast improvement on her first, filled with cheesy ballads and corny dance tunes. I reccomend this to any Brits fan, though I think its worth 3 and 1/2 stars, 4 is OK though. Peace Out!"
3,Not That Great,"To me this album was like an attempt to ""redo"" the first album with different tracks. Realistically, this album is probably better sounding than the first, but it's like britney made a cheap knock-off of her own debut album and trying to milk more money from it. However if you're still a fan of hers or pop music, I recommend listening to the album Walk of Life by Billie Piper. Billie was first, just less promoted, which is why she was often interpretted as the UK's britney spears. Anyway, back to britney, get this album if you liked her first album, like it or not is up to you, but be prepared for disappointment."
3,A Few Good Songs But Very Average,"That's the best I can describe Ms Spear's sophomore release. I absolutely LOVED 'Britney"" so I decided to c heck out her first two albums which were not to my surprise not that good. Too many songs are forgettable. The only ones I enjoyed are ""Can't Make You Love Me"", ""Lucky"", ""Stronger"" and the ballad ""Where Are You Now."" ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" sounds like a throwaway Shania Twain song, which ironically it is. The edited chorus totally ruins the laughable R&B-wannabe ""Don't Go Knockin On My Door."" I am also sick of hearing the title track for the umpth time. The horrid re-make of ""Satisfaction"" doesn't help either. If you want Britney Spears's best album, check out ""Britney."" DEFINATELY her best. ""Oops"" is a little better than her disastrous debut but still very average.C-"
3,This is an okay CD,"I don't really like Britney Spears anymore, but her music is okay. i hate the song 'oops i did it again' its annoying! I used to like it before, but now i don't. i do like the other songs though, in fact. i love the song 'don't let me be the last to know' and 'lucky' and 'when your eyes say it' and 'stronger'. i like her songs on the oops cd, i just don't like the 'oops i did it again song'. It's really dumb. anyways, if you're a britney fan or just like her songs then buy this cd if you want. but you're wasting part of your money, just on 1 (one) song which is the 'oops song'."
3,Look...,"Anybody who can take something titled ""Oops"" to number 1 has to be doing something right. Sure, she's insipid. Sure, her voice isn't all that (neither is Madonna's). Sure, she's showing a whole new generation how to make money by acting like a tramp. But let's face it, she's the best-marketed product of the new millenium, and you've got to give credit where credit is due.I only wish she'd actually sing her songs at awards shows, or at least lip-sync better while she has that snake around her neck. (I know, that's asking a lot!)"
1,listening to this makes me queesy,"this cd is not worth you're money. all of the songs sound the same. oops i did it again sounds just like hit me baby, and even songs like bye bye bye.it makes me so furious that people go insane over these bubblegum pop bands.""ooh, it must be so hard to be a singer, when all you do is let people write the songs for you, and have pictures taken of you every where you go""! i can see that she must work to accomplish so much fame, what, with all the computers enhancing her voice, and traveling around to make videos. and as much as she does herself, which isn't much, other bands are strugling, writing their own, worth listining to, songs, and don't get a penny for it. the only thing you really hear when listening to her, and other bands like her, is, ""i'm rich, and you're giving you're money to me! and what am i doing? exploiting myself"". anyway, that's probly what she's thinking as she sings these songs that everyone goes gaga over."
1,Oops!...You Bought It,"That this unlistenable fluff can be a best seller is testimony to either the powers of marketing or the musical bankruptcy of contemporary pop. Did I say ""contemporary""? This is 80s-style synth-pop all the way. Add a relentless dose of barely-literate lyrics, an appalling lack of memorable tunes and an absurd remake of Satisfaction. Voila: bubblegum hell. Now excuse me while I go look for my old Debbie Gibson albums."
2,"catchy songs, but no serious subject matter and no talent","when i purchased this album when it was released way back in may 2000, i was positive i'd enjoy it. back them i was a fan of miss spears. later i realized that the music business just isn't what it used to be. the songs are quite catchy, yet its all about teenage love, and she gets by the negative reviews with good looks and dance moves, which really aren't HER original choreography. i am not saying that the songs CAN'T be taken seriously, but britney can't be taken seriously while singing her songs, since she doesn't write them. she is NOT going to be singing in 5 years, so she might as well quit before its too late."
3,"A fresher, hipper sound","Britney Spears new, ""Oops!.. I Did It Again"" is a breath of fresh air. Her last album ""Baby Hit Me One More Time"" had a younger sound to it. This new album is packed with great sounds, lyrics, and beats. It shows her maturing talent, and expresses her sound much better than before. Has great lyrics, and a nice variety of songs. Most of the songs have great meaning behind this ... and I think this would be a great addition to anyones collection."
5,Britney Spears - EXCELLENT!,"Hi! This new album by Britney is really good! I couldn't stop listening to it! Some of the tracks are slow some are fast, but most of them are really catchy and you'll know the words to the songs really quickly! I think this new album is better than Britney's last one, and I hope all of you buy it so you can all get addicted to her CD/Tape!"
4,The C.D. is not as bad as what some people are saying...,"I do have to admit that the cd is not the best out there but it is truly not as horrible as what some people are saying. The only people who are writing the bad reviews are people who think that Kiss and Rage Against The Machine are actually musical. At least you can understand the words that she is singing. Yes, most of the songs are repetitive but you aren't able to tell if Kiss is repeating the same lyrics over and over again because you can't understand them.The only reason that I'm writing this because I want to make sure that none of you are paying attention to the reviews that are surrounding me. The people who wrote them are stoned, punk kids who will one day go deaf in both ears if they keep on listening to their type of music.The cd is doing extremely well on the billboards so that has to mean something."
2,"I know I won't endear myself to her millions of fans, but...","SHE DID DO IT AGAIN! How she managed to, after the first release is beyond me. ""Oops!"" slips with the artist's very limited vocals and extremely weak lyrics. But, I suppose, she is perfect for the little girls who drool at Spear's every ""note,"" outfit and dance ""step."""
1,Pitiful,I just bought this pitiful imitation of Black music for my niece. What a mistake. I strongly suggest investing in the real deal instead of the fake junk! Britney Spears is by no means Janet Jackson- give it up girl!
1,More Terrible Teen Trash,This music is so tasteless and bad. The only purpose it serves is to waste your parent's money. She will be a star only until another whiny teen singer comes along to take her place and then millions of teens will waste more of their parent's money. Let's find someone with at least a little talent next time.
2,Ooops She Did It Again!,"I really am not too sure bout Britney anymore, shes really not that good anymore. Like that song thats called what I call my dog, ya know, Lucky, is totally pointless, why would you sing about that, oh yeah Britney can get so jealouse of those movie stars sometimes! What more does she want! I don't know, I'm just totally annoyed by her now and 4 ever."
4,Pretty Good Album from The Pop Princess,"Why are some people saying bad things about this album? I'll agree that she doesn't have the best voice but so what? Each song has cool beats that are fun to dance to. The chorus of each song is pretty catchy and easy to sing along to. Britney is a very sweet singer and should not be put down. Believe me, this album is very good! The only reason it got four stars is because I feel that the last track, Dear Diary, is sort of cheesy. But overall, the rest of the songs are great!"
3,Fun and Energetic -- that's Briney!,"As the reigning Queen of Teen Pop Music, Ms. Spears has managed to capture a listening audience of more than just young girls and boys. She can appeal to adults as well. Her revealing costumes are part of her stage show, and I can't say I don't enjoy her performance, though it wouldn't hurt for Britney to just let her voice shine through once in a while rather than wow the crowd with naughty gestures and nearly-naked outfits. Her voice is strong and that's what will take her through this century. This CD is worth every penny, if not for the well-played radio hits like Lucky and the title track, but also for the newly released hits like Stronger."
4,kewl,this album is by far britney's best...but i think she could have done a hair better...i'm not being a critic i'm just saying...she's better then christina...and well in her music she tells how it is..
3,Its straight,"I got this cd when I was in the 5th grade when Britney Spears came out and some of the songs are really good. My personal favorites are ""Stronger"", ""Don't go knockin' on my door"", ""What u see is what u get"" and ""Can't make u love me"", she has some good songs on this cd, I think its good, but not better than the 1st."
4,There's no Oops about it,"I think that Britney Spears, 'Oops!..I did it again' album was very good. I was reading the other reviews and half of them seemed to intensely dislike it and think Britney was bad at singing, but I think that although some of the songs aren't all that good , the majority are. My fave's are Stronger, Lucky and What You See(Is What U Get). The one I like the least is the Girl in the Mirror. Most of the songs are good to dance to and have a good rhythm, while others are much slower and are good to relax to and sing along. I give my congrats to Britney Spears and I think she made a good choice bringing Lucky out as her next single."
2,IT IS BAD,well first of all the only good song on the cd is oops which is why i gave the cd the 2 stars all the other songs are just remakes of songs from before and the all have the same beat and tune. another thing miss britney cannot at all sing her voice cannot compare to all the other teen divas mandy moore jessica simpson christina augeilera they put so much more into their songs and they can sing much better her voice is obviously enhanced
1,This cd is crud,I don't like this cd because she always puts all the good songs more like one first and all the stupid songs last. If she wanted to keep people listening she might want to put the dumb songs first and the good ones last so people look forward to the end of the cd.
2,Oops...She Didn't Do It Again,"I bought this CD in spite of the fact that I don't really like the title track because I liked the first CD and thought that maybe there would be songs on this album that are better that it. That was a huge waste of money. All of the up-beat songs sound exactly like it. Most of the slow songs are boring and monotonous. Even though ""Where You Are Now"" is a beautiful song that does not make the album worth buying, but it is the reason I gave this CD 2 stars instead of one."
5,Britney Hits Us Baby...One More Time!,"The Britters has once again proved she deserves to be at the top with her newest album ""Oops!...I Did It Again."" On this album, Britney explores her emotions and even wrote and co-wrote some songs on the album. This album is definately much much better than ""...Baby One More Time"" and I thought that was the best album ever, well, imagine what this one is like. Many diss Britney and one of my friends did it all the time. When she heard ""Don't Go Knockin' On My Door"" she said ""I've got to get this CD! Britney all of a sudden got better and grew up!"" Well, another hater-turned-fan. I hope this album does better than the last because she truly deserves it. If *N Sync weren't so greedy with the #1 position on the Billboard 200 Album Charts, Britney would definately be there! Let's keep out fingers crossed! BRITNEY IS #1!"
5,She did it again!,"Britney Spears ""did it again"" with her second album ""Oops I Did It Again"". In this album- listeners can tell that Britney has grown from her ""Hit me one more time"" days and has proved herself as a talented singer. With her last album selling over 12 million copies- we can be sure that this one will do as well- hopefully even better. Her first single ""Opps I....again"" is played non-stop on all local radio stations and after listening to this album- I can tell you she is going to have another great year of tours and shows. Buy this album today and lets make Ms. Spears' second album out-sell her last one. 12 times platinum- can we do it?- Sure we can!"
1,1 Good Song,My 5 year old daughter asked me for this so I bought it used. You would think there would be a couple of good tracks besides the title track. Nope - I should have bought the single.
2,Awful AWFUL songs.,"So yeah the album is a completely moronic sludgefest. And to think that Britney had the audacity to cover the Rolling Stones classic ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" Give me Travis's cover of Britney's own ""Baby One More Time"" ANY day. At least that one had a sense of humor!!"
1,not good,Shes a VERY good looking girl and thats as far as it goes.No talent on this album at all people! From start to finish the album is trash.Good day! Dont buy this crap
1,Mediocre,"I can't imagine anyone but an indiscriminate fan enjoying this CD. Even my little sister, who listens to Britney's songs happily when they come on the radio says ""There are only a few good songs.""Britney Spears sounds like a chipmunk with a bad cold. Her voice sounds fake- it's almost always tinkered with by a computer. The producers tried to hide this with loud, distracting backround music. The songs are like copies of each other, and the one song Britney co-wrote could've been written by an 7-year-old.I'm not gonna say go buy a Nirvana CD instead, cuz if your considering buying this you probably wouldn't be interested. If still want a Pop-y sound, but with better vocals and slightly more meaningful lyrics, pick up Christina Augilera's album- it's much better."
1,The atrocities of our time,"Its truely amazing the things people would rather have than money. Why in gods name this piece of filth made it into even the top one thousand should be the 8th wonder of the world. I sincerely doubt that even a quarter of the people that bought this did so for any reason other than the slew of pictures that it came with. She's pretty hot, we all know that. But that DOES NOT mean she has an ounce of talent whatsoever. Wynona Rider should release a cd. I'm sure someone would buy it."
2,"Some poppy tunes, but I just have to say:","Curses to Spears for destroying the rock n' roll classic of classics, ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction."" The terrible remix of this wonderful Stones work just goes to show Britney's lack of respect for music. Still, if you're 14, a girl, and like to dance around the room because you're too young to drive, this one is for you. A personal note: I think it would be funny to give Spears a guitar, a piece of paper, and a pen and ask her to write a song. I bet the response would be, ""Well, I'll write the song, but first I need a keyboard, a drum machine, and a songwriter."""
1,So Fake,"Well i bought this cd because i thought it was going to be cool. i mean all those people can't be wrong. i liked the first few songs and the others were okay. but the lyrics really don't flow. it sounds like she just through an album together for the sake of having another album under her belt. the songs lyrics may be different but she sings the same in all of her up-tempo songs and all the same in her ""slow songs. i was cool with it for awhile because i was a britney fan but now i think shes a little over-done. her voice also sounds so ""studio magic"" i mean it sounds more like a computer than a person. I just hope she comes together to form a really good third album. i'm not ditching britney but i;m not really gonna support her until she gets something really good out on the market. if you want to enjoy britney and came to your senses and did not buy this cd, may i recommend her first cd: Bay one more time and her book: a mother's gift is really good."
1,OOPS is right.........,What a pathetic album. This is track after track of pure bubblegum mall diva. The vocals are shallow and the music is more karaokethan instrumental quality..
1,"Yeah, You Did Make Another Album Of Unoriginal Songs","Why are these teenagers addicted to Britney Spears, 'N Sync, and this other overproduced stuff that has nothing but some other guy's lyrics? Is that what teen society is coming to? I hope not, but so many of them are buying up these CD's of weak beats and childish lyrics that's its getting out of hand. Why don't Britney and the other boy groups write their own stuff for once? They might try singing about something else besides broken hearts and the tired subject of love that their writers and producers keep wanting them to sing about over and over. It's sad that Spears tries a cover of ""Satisfaction (I Can't Get No)"" by the Rolling Stones as if she is some type of rock icon. She's nothing and hopefully she will fade soon, maybe go to college, or just hide somewhere. That would be the best thing she could do right now."
3,It's All The Same,"The new Britney Spears CD has all the same types of song. It gets a little boring after listening to it a couple times.Some of the songs on the albulm seem to show that Britney ran out of song ideas like Lucky, One Kiss From You,which is similar to the one on the first CD called Thinking About You, and Dear Diary. I enjoy listening to pretty much all of the other tracks on the albulm."
2,Better than the 1st One.,"""Oops!..."", is a much better CD than Britney's first, ""Baby,One More Time"", but it is still not good enough to be called a good CD. One reason is because almost all the songs have the same beat. Another is because her love songs are cheesy and dull. Don't waste your money. Just get the singles."
2,Queen of Corny Music,yes that is Britney for ya... this cd is worse than the first...the only good songs are When your eyes say it and One kiss from you....the fast songs sound too manufactured and the slow songs sounds way too bland...and Dear Diary..that song is a joke! this cd is overall really corny...but if you just want some fun pop to sing along to then this is for you
3,Britney Spears.....She's ok I guess.,"I don't realy like Britney Spears but she does have some songs on Oops... I Did It Again that I kind of like. Her voice can't quite compare to alot of people but hey, atleast she's better than Marilyn Manson, right?"
4,Being Fair,"Let's get one thing straight I don't like Britney, but I do like her music. A lot of people [criticize] her voice, and while I'll admit her voice is anyhting but magical I do think she has some talent. Stressing the word some. As far as the CD goes, I love it. There is a great message behind a lot of the lyrics ""Stronger"" ""Lucky"" ""Can't make you love me"" these are all great songs! I would advise someone to buy this CD, but for little kids or even Junior High the videos can create real problems!"
4,Opps!..I Did It Again,"This Is a very delightful cd. The lyrics can really relate to some people either with a broken heart or a all-around person. She may not be the best singer, but she has good lyrics to get over someone and she will make someone feel happy. Some people may not buy this cd because of the way she looks,dresses,sings,etc. But look pass that and at least try to listening to one track,and it will make you sing and dance!"
5,"IT'S BRITNEY, OF COURSE IT'S GOOD!","Well, I have to admit, I love Britney Spears. I love all of her songs, everyone since ""Hit Me Baby One More Time."" This was a great CD all around. It was full of her latest and best songs. My favorite songs were Oops I Did It Again (of course), Lucky, and Stronger. I agree with a lot of people when they say that a lot of Britney's songs are very similar to each other, but they are all happy, fun, and lively songs. If you need something to cheer you up Britney's songs should do it. I don't care for some of Brit's slow songs, as much as the fun dancing ones, but the CD is well worth it."
2,Oops.. She should'nt have done it again,"Thank goodness this girl is cute because that is all I can say for her. This CD is full of tired rhythm tracks, sloppy ballads(Dear Diary), and bad singing. The title song is listenable but only once. I did'nt know where she was coming from with the RollingStones remake(Satisfaction). It seems so out of place and awkwardly done. I received the CD as a gift and believe me,they should'nt have."
5,Britney Rules!,"YES! She did it again! This album is full of excelent songs that probe the talent of Brit My favorite songs are Oops I did it again, Lucky, Dont let me be the last to know and Stronger. This is a must have album"
1,She did it again! The Worst CD of 2000.,"This must be the worst CD of 2000. Congratuations, Britney, for producing the worst CDs known to us. She doesn't know how to sing at all and now she says her voice is more mature. Give me a break, her voice is much more disgusting than the last time. I feel like she's screaming everytime I hear her music."
2,"I'M SORRY, I HATE IT!","I thought this cd really stunk. I used to be a fan but this cd changed my mind. She's trying to be someone she's obviously not. I dislike her voice, and the fact that she would rather reach the male audience than the 4 yr. olds who horribly, want to grow up to be like her! I'm sorry, but this cd really dissapointed me."
1,"When you're a musician who isn't remembered for her music, that's a bad sign.","So, what is it that people see in Mrs. Spears? It's not her music, I've worked that much out. It probably isn't her nonexistant, overblown ""sexuality"", either. At this point, she's became a parody of herself. It's probably because she's tabloid fodder...yeah, that's it...it's useless people like Brittney that should be sent off to fight for Iraq."
1,Darned awful!,"Man, I didn't realize pop music has gotten this bad. This is the worse drivel I've heard in a long time - tacky lyrics and poor singing by Spears mars this release. The production sounds like it was artificially produced. Not recommended."
1,....,"....The beat to the songs on ""Oops! I Did It Again"" are dreadfully identical to those on her first album — perhaps because she can only perform one dance and needs the same beat for her videos. There is so much technical audio, no one knows what Spears' voice truly sounds like. And what makes me the sickest is the ""verbal"" interruption she adds to her songs that are so fakely outrageous it is just disgusting!"
1,Puleeze!,"Even one star is a lot for this overrated pop artist who would be no where without her looks and sexy wardrobe. I bought this album thinking it would be worthy of my listening. Think Again. Poor Rolling Stones must be falling to their graves kicking themselves for allowing the slaughtering of their song. I'm sorry to all you fans who think this girl can sing, but I'm giving my opinion on this album and for those of you who are uncertain of purchasing it, go to the Christina Aguilera or Celine Dion section. They CAN SING."
1,What an ugly jailbaited mamacita!,"Toro: Pancho, I am so sick of this Brittaney Speers mamacita! Pancho: She was one airbrushed teenager who has now turned into a tramp! Toro: This mamacita didn't even write her own songs(like the awful title cut, Lucky and Stronger which are all as bad as a contaminated cucaracha), they was all penned by a Swedish cucaracha Max Martin and the result was bubble gum at it worst. Pancho: Her cover of The Rolling Stones' Satisfaction is the musicla equal to someone crashing their car into a tree at 100 miles an hour and dying. Toro: This record sold less than her debut with only 10 million sold in America. Pancho: This gringo's career was starting to slide. Toro and Pancho say save your pesos and purchase The Best of The Tijuana Toads instead and avoid this music prostitute."
3,"Um, wow...did she do it again?","Britney Spears is back...to the delight of some and to the horror of others. The title track as well as all the tracks written by Sweedish writer Max Martin are extremely infectious and catchy, such as ""What You See(Is What You Get)"". It seems obvious though that Britney does most of the ""oohs"", ""ahhs"", and ""oh baby's"", and her back-up singers do a large portion of the singing. The album is best when it sticks to the fast, dance beats, and stays away from the ballads. The cd seems to be manufactured to create alot of singles, being it includes pop friendly tunes, a few R&B style tracks, and the slow songs. The cd does succeed in what it is trying to do, sell records and be perfect for MTV's TRL voting audience. I do recomend this cd as it is a good second effort from a singer who will probably be sticking around."
2,mostly pop junks,"Britney's songs have nice up-lifting beats. But if you listen to all the songs, you would think they are pretty much the same. With her half moaning, half groaning at the beginning and few seconds of silence in the middle toward the end. Miss Spears should work with a variety of creative song writers who can provide her different styles of songs! Not just these pop junks that have little insights into real life."
2,I REALLY did try to like it!,"Can Britney's fans really be honest with themselves or does Britney's music simply appeal to those who just don't have any good taste in music? My roommate purchased the album yesterday and as I was listening I told myself to really give it a shot and to listen with out prejudice. Well the verdict is in and it's not good. Maybe I'm too old (22 yr.old,) to appreciate what Britney brings to the table, musicaly speaking- for that I thank God! For those who are claiming ""she did it again..."" what exactly did she do aside from contribute to the world of bad music?"
1,"Oops, she did it again","Kill me now, this famous Britney Spears decided to re-make a classic. Yes, her sad destruction of Satisfation was horrible. She added another minute to the song with all of her UHS and YEAHS. Her upbeat drums and guitars in the background were superb, especially to cover up her rough vocals. In short by listening to this album, I come to the conclusion that B.Spears, is just a Karaoke Singer who got lucky."
5,The Best!,"Britney sure got some good writers and producers for this CD. The album is mostly fast paced songs, and the slow songs are very good. Where are You Now showcases how Britney can sing amazingly when she isn't doing lots of dance moves. And the faced pace songs are what Britney is all about: catchy, dancable, and awesome. Britney put a lot of work into this, and it shows. I'm a huge Britney fan, and all my friends are. If you like rap and hip-hop... you won't care for this, but what would you be doing here in the first place? If you like pop music, this will never leave your CD player. And that's all I have to say about that!"
3,I like her music but it's way overproduced,"First of all, her music is great to listen to and to play at dances and stuff. But come on! It's all overproduced. She cannot sing any of these songs live. I saw this TV special where she lip synched the whole thing. Her music is catchy, and yes i do have both of her cds but she has no talent. Well Max Martin did a great job producing and writing her stuff but she'll be gone in like a couple of years from now. I loved this CD when it came out, but now I realize that it's not like she put any effort into this CD. She only wrote one song, Dear Diary, which is not good. If she wasn't pretty and she was singing baby one more time no one would like her. Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson have a lot better voices and they perform a lot better. At least they can sing what they record."
1,PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-UUUUUUUUUUUUUU!,"Oh good gracious me, where should I start? This ""music"" is downright awful! Bubblegum pop trash with not an ounce of talent whatsoever! Britney can't sing to save her soul. And don't get me started on her version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction! My advice: Don't buy this ridiculous bubblegum pop trash! Buy some REAL music like Styx, Journey, REO Speedwagon, etc. THOSE bands are capable of putting out REAL music. They write their own songs and play their own instruments. (Something Bratney doesn't do!)"
2,"it's ""ok""",what can i say about this CD well it's kindof good...i just listen to like the same 2 songs over and over again...well alot of the songs on this CD kind of all sound VERY the SAME to me...well that is just my opinion go ahead and buy it if your intrested into someone who can just dance...that's all i think she can do b/c the kid has no voice...seriously....Lucky and track 1 are the only songs i really listen to...but the other ones i was hoping for more....alot more!
1,They actually let her do it again?,"Can anyone say Recycle? God, and I thought when my dorky lil teenaged cousin played the first one was bad, now i have to listen to this crap. Girlfriend. . . . no. Just plain NO. Go get some voice lessons first cuz the Mickey Mouse squeaking thing is OVER! I'm telling this as a former 80's pop star fan, all you little ones will get over it. Trust me.Thank goodness."
1,bad cd!,"this is a bad cd, and a bad singer! i admit britneycan NOT sing at all!!! i used to like her when shefirst started out but now i don't like her! i own thiscd yes, but i don't listen to it anymore hardly. do yourselfa favor and don't buy this CD! britney can't sing! my momdoesn't even like britney! neither do some of my friendsat school, they don't like her either!"
2,Oops!... I Wrote The Same Record AGAIN!,Britney spears' album sounds almost like a replica of ...Baby one more time! and what's with all the weird talking in all of her songs!
5,Britney Spear,"Britney did it again!!!In this cd my favourite song is ""Lucky""!! If you like dancing and slow motion songs then this is the cd for you!!!!!"
1,EEEEEYUCK,"This is not meant to be taken offensively I'm just making my opinion heard. So let me start by saying this is the worst CD I've ever heard. I only gave it one star because there's nothing lower than that. Her voice is high and squeaky and sounds like she has something caught in her nose. Let me be frank. I am NOT a Britney Spears fan. But that didn't keep me from having an open mind about this. I listened to it. And only after that did I declare that it was the worst filth I've ever heard. Oops I did it again is one of the most poppy and tacky songs I've ever heard (and what is up with the music video?)Oops I did it again is second only to Lucky, THE worst song I've ever heard. I enjoyed Britney Spears when she first came out with Baby One More Time. But then I watched her true persona get worse and worse. If you're looking for a good CD with excellent vocals STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
4,This cd is good,"It took me a while to finally get hooked on this cd. This cd is really good. It's not the best cd in the world, but it's a lot of fun. It's got some really good pop songs (What You See, Lucky, Oops) and some good ballads (Dear Diary & Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know). The only thing it really needs is Britney to stop being so nasally. Her voice would sound so much better if she didn't sound as whiny in her songs. If you love fun pop songs, then this cd is definitely for you."
3,more teenie bopper stuff,"This CD isn't anything great. I guess it has its moments, but it is overly computerized. I gave it 3 stars because I like the title track, and a couple of other songs. Otherwise, it's not that great"
3,Oops!,"Okay, I know Britney Spears is a super-star pop diva whatever you want to call her. And I know that her CDs have made uber amounts of money and little boys and girls everywhere at some time or another had every single song of hers memorized. But- and this is the truth- even though a couple of her songs are pretty good and get in your head, they are pretty much all the same. And the love songs and ballads that she tries to pull off don't go with her voice, and they end up sounding fake and really shallow. I know that that's kind of harsh, but still, that's the way this CD comes across and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone that likes the hip hop and pop rock of today."
2,Okay this is probably the better of her 3 albums,"This album is not great but it does have the most catchy dance songs out of all her albums. I wish she could sing better but her voice is so awful. It's sad because everyone thinks she is so great but all she is, is a Madonna wannabe. SHe will never have the lasting career that Madonna has. Madonna is actually an intelligent, talented woman who has a lot to offer to the music industry. Britney really has nothing great to offer. SHE CANNOT SING!!!! Everything about her is fake. Especially her voice. It sounds so made up."
3,"Oops...she did it again...but why, really?","It was the summer of 2000, and i was at camp. Some girl had just bought the latest Britney album...She asked me to listen to one song, and it just so happened to be ""Lucky"". I thought it was good, nothing too out of the ordinary. I ended up listening to the whole album and obviously, some of the songs were catchy. But when it comes down to it, only half the album is really worth it..Oops i did it again, Stronger, Dont Go Knockin, Cant get no Satisfaction, What u see is what u get and Lucky are really the only good songs, while 3 or 4 of the other slow, irritating ballads are simply ""skip-worthy"" and the other few arent worth anyones time. The sad part is is that the songs i listed are only fun to listen to because they are catchy, not b/c britney is a good singer. Hopefully, by her 5th album, Britney will develop some sort of talent that is worthwhile.Overall, this CD is okay. If you want it, buy it."
2,Hmmm...caught in the middle,"This is Britney's 2nd of 3 CDs. In her debut, she was introducing pop, and in the third, she tried (unsuccessfully) to abandon it. This record sounds almost identical to ""...BOMT"", but not as good. I didn't like it. If there was one song I do like, it's ""Stronger"". Most of the songs on here sound like a mixture of her debut and ""Britney"" material. The dialogue at the end of ""Don't Go Knockin' On My Door"", ""What U See (Is What U Get)"" and ESPECIALLY the dialogue before ""Dear Diary"" was extremely annoying and could have done without...I mean, who talks like that? Not horrible, but could have been better. Even the pics weren't all that great...uggh!"
5,Britney Kicks...!,"I've only been a fan of Britney since Baby One More Time, 99. And I still am today! I love her OOPS I DID IT AGAIN CD. I'm trying to get into other singers' music, cos I'm tired of hearing the same Celine music everyday. And Britney is a great singer, I found that out and I also found that she has great dance moves by watching her pepsi commercial(s). She has 3 pepsi commercials...! Although nobody likes her at my school, and hardly no one else in this world. Even my mom, doesn't like her cos of the way she dresses,bla bla doesn't matter to me, I like the way she dresses. I don't see why ppl have to be so mean to Britney!! Except for her fans are the only ones who like her. Like ME! :-) hehe. Anyways, back to the CD. I just love the songs, Stronger, Lucky, One Kiss From You, Don't let me be the last to know, when your eyes say it, and where are you now. So... if you like good POP music, then I suggest you buy Britney's release of Oops..! I Did It Again."
2,OPPS,Britneys Opps I Did it Again is a major OPPS. It is a waste of your money!! Do not buy it!!! You will be so sorry. She can not sing!!!
2,"Oops, not much happened","People, this is insane, this album was ranked #1 selling on amazon BEFORE it came out! How much can you base an album on a single song! On the otherhand, Britneys success has alot to do with marketing, her pop image, and some good tunes - overall very well packaged.To be honest, there are a few good songs on this new album(eg. ""Where are You Now"", ""Stronger""), but gives a similar feeling in tunes and lyrics as her first album, as if both album were done right after one another.Alot of comparison has been drawn between Britney Spears, and Mandy Moore; To be fair I gave both their second album a listen, and Mandy's album definitely shows more growth and maturity in style and content.I like both Britney and Mandy, but the best bang for the buck belongs to Mandys ""I wanna be with you"". Keep a open mind, give it a try, and you will probably like Mandys new album.But if you are a Britneys fan to start with, you will still enjoy this album."
1,unbelievable,"It's amazing to me how many people wrote good reviews on this no-talent girl. Most of the songs on this cd sound EXACTLY THE SAME. Plus, they're not even that good. The re-make of ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction"" is horrible. Devo did a better job covering that song. She CANNOT sing! There are much better pop cds out there to invest in. Why waste time with Britney Spears when she has no talent and she'll disappear in another year anyway? Just like Hanson and the Spice Girls, three years from now we'll read about Britney Spears in the ""Where Are They Now?"" section of People Magazine."
3,Not Britney's best,"I'm not going to diss britney but this album is not her best. Some tracks are good like 'dont go knocking on my door, oops..., stronger (the best song0. I think this album lacked more of Britney's realism. Overall it's ok to listen to for a while but it gets boring really fast."
1,Its amazing......,"....how many people will listen to this ... just beacuse she looks good!, fine she's cute, but this music stinks. repetative. Prerecorded sound tracks, she doesnt even play an instrument ladies and gentleman! neither does her band (if that what you call it - i call it a 4 track record with music on it)"
5,Britney is Hot,"yep, Britney is hot. Thas about it. Her music is really catchy too. I heard her Oops song at Prom last weekend. Its a good song."
5,Oops....She Did It Again!,"I think this album is really kewl. It has a whole bunch of new songs blended together that make the album lost of fun 2 listen 2. The lyrix are great, and I luv the song ""Lucky""! Well that's about all I wanted 2 say. Ciao!"
2,Oops! I have little real talent and I am short.,"No, Britney is not a bad person or anything. But, heck, all her weaknesses are exposed here: thin voice, lack of emotive strength, and any real committment to music.I like party sounds as much as anyone, but this stuff is like cotten candy that you can't stop eating."
2,oops!...not what I was expecting,"I admire Britney for what she has accomplised, althout this album needed to be a little better. There are some good tracks but there are a lot of tacky, shallow songs. I think she needs to work with a writer that will compliment her excellent voice. I thought Babyface was going to work on this album and when I picked it up and saw that he didn't I was spewing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good efort just not good enough for what she is capable of doing. Infact I like her first album a little better because of the fact that it contained outstanding tracks. Overall a dissapointing efort and I think Britney would agree. Songs like ""Don't go knocking on my door"", ""lucky"", ""One kiss from you"", ""where are you Now"" and ""Dear Dairy"" should not even be on this cd. I like ""Don't let me be the last to know"" - catchy courus although it's sounds familiar."
1,Unmitigated garbage,"If you're pretty you can do anything with the right marketing. As George Carlin so rightly said, ""If you take two pieces of wood and nail them together in a way no one has done before, some schmuck will buy it."""
1,gimme a brake,"this proves that once again that STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE does not make a masterpiece.I never liked Britney or any of those boy bands or girl singers. And I'm 19yrs old. I like real, deep singers like Janet and the avant garde Madonna.She could've used this album as an opportunity to change her music style rather than go with the same bubblegum crap that was her first album. But no, much like the Backstreet Boys and NSuck, she capitalizes on this unfortunately successful album buy replicating the immature lyrics (that she didn't write or produce) and music that made the first album a success. What's sadder is that if you listen closely to ""Oops.."" and ""Stronger"", the music beats sound the same as ""Hit Me Baby"" and ""Crazy"" from her last album, just arranged differently.Too bad, it's no longer about making memorable and insightful music; it's all about who can sell the most records. What a shame."
1,oops... too bad you can't give a 0 star!,Talk about a lack of girl power. she is so lame. And her new video really stinks. please don't waste time and money buying this album.
3,Opps Britany can't sing,I just felt the need to warn all you people like myself that have a tendency to buy what is hot at the moment. This C.D. is straight form the N Sych/Backstreet Boys factory. There are a few fun songs but there are also many annoying moments. Britanys' voice is much weaker than I could tell from her previous album and has a tendency to wear on your nerves. The music on this album is intense causing her shrill voice to be very present. The lyrics are weak for the most part and the little talking bits in the songs don't seem as interesting as they did when Janet Jackson did it years ago. I also feel the need to thank Britany's major influences for her since she would never admit them herself. On her behalf I would like to thank Samantha Fox whos' chessy version of Satisfaction was clearly her inspiration and of course we need to thank Debbie Gibson with the noteable exception that Debbie can write and sing.
1,Oops!.....I look like a slut!,"Can't she just get hit with another camera, and maybe ruin her face? I mean, come on! We already have enough teeny bopper bands here, we don't need more of them making new albums. All of her songs sound the same, and in every one she's talking about a guy, who she'll never get. And does she really have to show off her boobs. NEWS FLASH! EVERBODY ALREADY KNOWS YOU GOT A BOOB JOB, YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOW THEM OFF IN EVERYONE OF YOUR VIDEOS!"
2,Just another blond.,"Ok, her songs are catchy, I admit it. But are radio stations DJ Adam Smasher is a mastermind. She seems to set herself up for his parodies. (Checkout the 104KRBE website) her voice is flat, and her songs bore me. Her voice is obviously electronicly enhanced, and you can tell. I'd give it a one but oops is an DECENT song. Basicly this album shows her no talent, and it sucks!"
3,oops...its only o.k.,"Well this cd is ok, but nothing exceptional. Almost all of the songs sound like the title track-Oops..I did it again. Still a worthwile investment , though."
4,Britney Did It Again!,Britney did it again! She made another great CD! The songs are much more vocal and really sound more mature. She has a great voice!
1,please...,"the only reason this album is more ""mature"" is because her songwriters knew that's what the teenyboppers who bought this want to hear. of course she'll talk about not feeling lonely because that's what people are expecting.the thing that annoys me most about her is that she can't sing. she can carry a tune, but she doesn't have a strong voice at all. who cares if she can dance? if you're going to be a pop star, at least have a decent voice."
5,Britney show cases her talent!,"On this album there are many beautiful ballads such as""When Your Eyes Say It"" (Such a sweet beautiful song)""Dont Let Me Be The last To Know"" (which was written by Shania Twains husband)""Where Are You Now"" (Amazing vocals shown on this song just amazing)""Dear Diary"" (Written by Britney herself,Very sweet song)And the up tempo amazing Pop classics!This album is great and is my fav album now for the past few years!"
5,Luv This CD,"Allright, I know that this is just a little girl CD, but it is way good!! Turn off your computer and buy it!!"
1,OOPS.,"Ooops... I did it Again is the perfect name for this album. I can completely agree with that feeling- making this CD was definetely an Ooops.I hated this CD because1. It's bubblegummy pop, sweet like candy music.2. It's a repeat of the songs from Baby on More Time.3. She has no vocal talent.4. She has no lyrical talent either, she has a songwriter.So, what did we learn from this?That Britney is a tall, blonde, dummy with no imagination, or, that we should all respect each other's opinions (including mine). You decide for yourself."
4,A great teeny bopper CD,If you like pop....you'll like Britney Spears. The music is really good if you like Britney.
1,"Well, Don't Do It Again","You did it again? So that's where the smell is coming from; hope it didn`t get on your shoe. What you get here is indistinguishable dance pop, one of the worst covers of ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" imaginable, and a Shania Twain-penned song to boot (""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know"") -- there's not this much cheese in Wisconsin."
1,Oops! She did it again!,"In the last few months Britney as gone from the who cares to the who wants to know person in the music biz. Her newly founded sex show of a CD has me thinking, ""is she just in it for the money?"" Well, to what I think of the CD... it seems like the 7 years old focus is making her rich but thats about it. I really think she will be gone in a few short lived months, or I really hope! The CD is over rated and not all that good!"
4,What you see is definately what you get,"This album is typical Britney. I mean, if you don't like her music, you won't like this album. That's just the way it goes. But for Britney lovers, this is way better than the first album. The songs have good beats, and the slower songs aren't bad. Even though some of the songs have a tendency to sound the same, so what? That style works for her so she's obviously going to keep doing it. But overall, I really liked this album."
2,"It's okay, I guess...","I'm not a really fan of Britney, but I like her music. It is okay! A friend of mine bougth this CD for me, it has an Extra Track called ""Girl In THe Mirror!"" That song is not very good, but it's okay. The other song I don't like is the title track, and I also don't like Dear Diary. Britney (Of Course!) wrote this song, it says so in her booklet. All of the other songs are good, but When Your Eyes Say It , doesn't make sence. I used to not like that song but now I do even tho the title doesn't make sence. The reason why I gave off 3 Stars is because of the songs Girl In The Mirror (On The European Versionz, which I have!), Title Track and Dear Diary. That is why I gave off 3 stars... other than that Britney did a great job on this album.My favorite songs are, Stronger, Lucky, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know*Good luck, Britney!*!..."
1,Oops..she didn't do anything,"This is an album that has many catchy tunes with a good beat but I don't think Britney ""did it again"". The credit for both of her albums popularity should go to the people whowrote the songs and music. It seems to me that she is just a tool used to sell the albums by selling her sexuality. Her singing is mediocre and very much drowned out by the backup music. I've personally heard better karaoke. I did not write this to bash Britney after all I have never met the girl;however as an avid music lover I would not recommend this album to those who,like myself, would rather listen to music whos popularity comes from the talent of a hard working band, or the depth of lyrics written by the performer and not music that is more of a fasion show."
3,"Shades of ""Pink""","Max Martin does need to broaden his palette; he seems to ape other songs and other styles a lot on the release. Take ""Don't Go Knockin' on My Door"", for instance: a Pink ""There You Go"" knock-off, this song would have the edge they are looking for if someone such as Pink, with a voice, performed it. ""Stronger"" is a ""Larger than Life"" knock-off. Only so much could be done though for someone such as Britney with a limited range."
4,Better then the first!,"K,I didnt like her first cd that much. This one i think is a lot better best tracks are Lucky, What U See, Stronger and Where Are You Now?. Dont Let Me B The Last To know is a good song, but you can hear her breathing and *as a singer* you shouldnt hear it especially on a cd. Satisfaction is certainly a different cover i don't mind it. Dear Diary was a good attempt , but the lyrics are very childish(in my opinion). She doesn't have the strongest voice eg. Christina, yet her voice isn't bad. This cd is good if you like pop, or upbeat. Yet if you like ballads, this cd isnt for you."
2,"Oops! She did it again, but I'm not impressed","I was not particularly impressed with Britney Spears latest offering. The title track ""Oops! I did it again"" is an almost exact replica of ""Baby one more time"". In fact, you can substitute the line ""I'm not that innocent"" with ""Hit me baby one more time!"" without missing a beat! It lacks originality and seems to be copying the style of the first album in order to rack up sales. However, applause must be given for Ms Spears's attempt to have a more mature sound on this album."
1,Garbage,"Quite possibly the worst cd ever made. Terrible songs, Terriblevoice, ad infinitum..... This cd is the equivalant of plastic. Fake,synthetic, heartless, corny, & insulting. The sad thing is that it will sell millions of copies. People need to wake up. This type of music is what will sow the seeds of destruction & downfall for mankind.I'm very sad right now. :("
2,Oops!...I Wrote the Same Record Again.,"If you're looking for a more mature, emotionally involved set from Spears, you won't find it here. Sadly, Oops!...I Did It Again is merely an extension of her debut CD ...Baby One More Time. Trading up ""Hit me baby one more time"" for ""I'm not that innocent"" is really the only difference between the two. All of the songs on the new CD sound alike, as if a drum machine was left on throughout the entire recording and Spears just laid down tracks to it. Her cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" is horrific. Her vocals ping-pong from orgasmic to constipated and the result is a breathy, overly synthesized song with little substance, but will make Mick Jagger richer. Overall, this sophomore set is utterly sophomoric, and guaranteed to sell at least 8 million copies. In the end, Spears will retain her Teen Queen title, which is a shame, because there are more deserving artists."
4,She did it again...,"When I started to listen to my little sister's copy of this CD, I expected the typical trio of catchy bubble gum songs and a bunch of not so great ""fillers"". I was pleasently surprise! Although songs like ""stronger"" and ""baby, what you see is what you get"" all carry familiar tones, every song on the CD is fun, catchy, and interesting to listen to. Who buys a britney spears CD to listen to her voice? It's the infectious tune and pop-inspired lyrics that are fun to listen to! Regardless of her voice or her talent, this CD is catchy and original...I look forward to seeing which songs becomee hit singles."
4,Good CD,"I like this CD. I thought it was really good. Even though Britney Spears is not the best singer, she is still good. I liked it because she was kind of writing songs about herself, which I thought was a good idea. I did not like where she says ""It's so beautiful"" to the man in Oops! I Did It Again. Overall this was a good CD."
1,"More mature lyrics, yes, but the voice is bad.","I agree that this album is much more maturely written than her debut album. Songs like ""Stronger"" and ""Lucky"" reflect that. However, there is one thing that makes this album bad: Britney Spears' voice. For God's Sakes, she sounds like a chipmunk on these songs. There are only, in my opinion, two good songs: #7 and #9. Britney may look good, yes, but that's about it. That trashy VMA awards performance turned me right off."
3,"Not as good as ""The Wall""","In comparing this album to pink floyds ""the wall"", I would have to say that it falls short of the latter albums greatness and sheer strength. Britney's cover of the rolling stones ""satisfaction (i cant get no)"" brings new emotional depth to the lyrics and music, And whoever created that great electronic guitar riff should be commended on improving ""Guitarist"" Keith Richards poor riffage. Great album, but still no ""white album"""
1,"Oops, she sounds bad again","Move over Hoku! The next manufactured blonde bimbette has come along and she goes by the name of Britney Spears. We all know her by her ""catchy"" songs ""Oops...I did it again"" and ""...Baby One More Time"". ""This is a story about a girl named Lucky... A girl who got silicone breast implants"" Britney, we all know it wasn't the silicone that screwed you up, your mom dropped you on your head as a baby. Poor Britney. Let's all go cry over her while she pilfers millions masquerading as talent. She probably lays her producers just to get somewhere!I would have rated this negative all the stars in the sky but they just wouldn't let me. Oh well. I'm going to go work on the pgsweetpg: unholyangel.net"
5,Worth the dough!,"Once you listen to this C.D, you won't regret buying it. Each song is very different from each other, and thats exactly what teens want these days: variety. Although Britney does'nt sound as innocent as she did in ""Baby One More Time"", I'm sure most teens will enjoy this C.D. ""OOps....I did it again"" is definitely worth the dough!"
2,"Dust Yourself Off and Try Again, Britney.","Is Britney's second record better than I expected? Yes. Would I recommend it? Not if you're over twelve. The title track and ""Lucky"" are such well-crafted slices of pure pop courtesy of Max Martin. These songs go down easy, and you'll be humming to their choruses long after they're finished. Spears even gives us a some country flavor on the Mutt Lange/Shania Twain-penned ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know."" But elsewhere, the record takes a nosedive--and fast. The cringe-inducing ""Dear Diary"" sounds so girlish from a college-age woman. She desecrates the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction,"" quite possibly the greatest rock and roll song ever. And there are a bunch of other songs that are similarly disastrous. Back in her day, Kylie Minogue sang songs that were just as formulaic as Britney's, but at least she evolved from that stage and matured as a performer. With Britney, I'm not so sure. While this record isn't a bust, her fans deserve much better than this."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DESERVES A 0,"NOW I DON'T USUALLY TAKE THE TIME TO GIVE BAD REVIEWS BUT THIS CD WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. WHEN MY SISTER PLAYED THIS ALBUM AT HOME I COULD HAVE CRIED. BRITTNEY SPEARS IS BEAUTIFUL LIKE AALIYAH AND MARIAH CAREY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE CAN NOT SING LIKE THEM. UNFORTUNATELY LOOKS CAN'T SHOW THROUGH A RADIO. I WATCH HER VIDEOS AT HOME BECAUSE SHE IS SEXY, BUT I TURN THE TV TO MUTE. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE CALLING HER THE QUEEN OF POP WHEN THERE IS MADONNA, MARIAH CAREY, JANET JACKSON(ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED MORE OF R&B), AND EVEN CHRISTINIA AGUILERA. ...IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A TALENTED DIVA BUY MARIAH CAREY'S GREATEST HITS OR MADONNA V2."
2,why the ballads???,"I am not the sort of person to listen to britney spears music,but i will hold my hands up and say i do quite like her uptempo songs and this is comming from a guy that likes the lostprophets,the hives and A.That said what britney needn't have done is spoil the whole album with bloody ballads.Quite frankly the it would be a far more enjoyable album if you just repeated 'oops i did it again' ten or twelve times over at least it would save you from pressing the repeat button on your cd player.also i don't agree with one persons comments about what music is,music may be about standing amnd listening to your band in the rain but to others its more a bubblegum fun pleasure such as dancing like a maniac around your room.i still don't like the ballads though."
1,O.K.,All you girls (or guys) out there who want to buy this CD needs to pay attention to this. My advice would be to a single CD of the song you like on this album cuz' if you don't you'll end up doing what I'm doing (selling it)cuz' you'll only like 2 to 3 songs off it and the other ones will get very annoying after you've listend to them a few times.So please don't buy this CD if you only like 1 or 2 songs cuz' it's a rip off!!!
1,the worst birthday gift ever received,My sister sent this britney spears cd as my birthday gift last month. It's horrible. The only thing that is good is that she's got a pretty face with hot body. Her music [stinks] anyway.
1,It's new?,"Sorry Britney, but this CD is just like the first one! If you're not sure you want to buy this CD, let me give you some advice -- DON'T DO IT! All of her fast songs are the same and so are her poorly sung ballads. This CD makes me wonder why some people just can't see (or should I say hear?) real talent!"
3,She did it again all right...,"Oops, she did it again. And that's the biggest disappointment of this new album. It sounds exactly like her ""Baby One More Time"" fare, so that means another dozen or so tracks of teen bubble-gum pop.Now this isn't necessarily bad if you like that sort of thing, but I was secretly hoping that Spears would somehow show some trace of versatility. She doesn't. The songs sound the same, her voice sounds the same (maybe a bit edgier), and the lyrics are the same ""Hey baby why are you breaking my heart"" or ""Why am I breaking your heart"" or ""Why are they breaking our hearts"". It gets old. Of course, I can't fault Spears for her lyrics...she didn't write them anyway.To the album's credit, the songs are as catchy as they've ever been. No doubt, it'll still go platinum, but just in case it flops, the producers have a backup plan--plenty more videos with her dancing around in schoolgirl outfits."
1,Oops she did it again,"Oops she failed again! I bougt this CD because I heard Oops I did it again on the radio and liked it. But now, I have no earthly idea why i wasted money for such an awful CD. No catchy tunes, no different sounding songs, no good songs at all. This CD and her other one show exactly how much talent Britney has-- barely any at all. Though there are some songs i like, like Lucky and Oops I did it again, all of these songs get old. There are so many other talented teen girls, like Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson, I don't even see how Britney has a chance.There is no way i recomend this CD because I promise you that they can enjoy."
3,Its better then the first album,"This album is pretty kewl,even though I'm not into this kind of music but it has some good dance music on it and i use to be a teeny bopper,god knows i hated that stage,lol,but the album has kewl songs on it,I like about maybe 5 songs,but her redoing of (i cant get no)satisfaction,should not of been done that song is rolling stone material not britney spear(teeny bopper)material,i wonder what the rolling stones have to say about this?"
3,Stop teasing me.,"I like to get my groove on when I listen to Britney Spear's pop hit, ""Oops! I did it again!"" One time in gym class, this song came on and I proceeded to bop my head back and forth because I thought I was at one of her concerts. Wasn't that a tease! In fact... when I watch the music video I feel like she's teasing me. I keep telling her to stop, but no, she never does. In conclusion, I feel that this is a good album to get your groove on or bop your head to, especially if you feel like you're being teased by Britney."
1,"That's right, everyone!","How she got a record contract is beyond me. She needs to be spending her time on singing lessons than making this crap. When is she going to face the fact that she has NO TALENT? The cover of ""satisfaction"" was utterly repulsive! Who gave permission to let her remake that song? She completely butchered it with her ""uh"" between each word. Also if you put the song ""Oops!..I Did It Again"" and ""Baby, One More Time"" you can hear that they are exactly the same. Can't you realize that? STOP WASTING YOUR TIME ON BRITNEY SPEARS. Why can't we give record contracts for those who deserve it? IF YOU OWN THIS ALBUM, I HOPE YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING AT NIGHT!"
1,"O Yeah Britanny, definitely a BIG ""OOPS""","I was disappointed when i got to this form and realized I couldn't give 0 stars. heh heh. It's a complete mystery to me how this garbage sells. It's the same song, over and over and over and over and over. And what is with her jaw-droppingly bad cover of ""Satisfaction""? The sad thing is, the pre-teens who listen to this trash probably don't even know that it was once a good song! That made me very very upset. Another thing that drives me crazy is that the girl has absolutley no talent! She can't sing, and her voice sounds like a cartoon alien or something, way over commercialized and just... really bad. Do yourself and humanity a favor and do not buy this record."
2,Britney Spears....,"is like a burning building, you want to look away but are compelled to watch. I only bought this cd for the song ""Stronger"" and that's pretty much the only one I like, other than ""Oops!..I Did It Again"". There's only so much that can be said for pre-fabricated pop culture. Sure it's fun for now but fame is fickle. Sorry Britney. Will I probably try to unload this...in the future? Yes..."
3,"Part of it worth reading, the majority not","The author shows how mythology indicates a close kinship between the areas around the Irish Sea and Atlantis. That part is worth reading and interesting, as it throws light on another Atlantis book, ""Atlantis from a Geographer's Perspective"", which pinpoints Atlantis as Ireland based on a scientific study of geography.Which brings us to the weak point in this book: Where it tries to explain why this similarity exists. The explanation is so wild that it totally destroys the credibility of the book. If the author had only refrained from those speculations, and written a shorter book, it could have gotten 5 stars from me. But now it gets 3, the average of the bad and good parts."
1,Terrible movie,Terrible movie. It looks like it was made with a home video camera. My young kids even thought that it was a cheap movie.
1,right box wrong size,"I have ordered this product for over 25 years and never had a problem. Swingline gave the manufacturing of this product to China. Now the finger pads are about 1/2 the size they are supposed to be. I have small fingers, but not that small! Instead of pulling the bad product, they just keep shipping it and tell you to try back, maybe the old stock will be gone.This is very frustrating. I haven't found anything to replace this product. I work in the plumbing industry and one of the first things I learned - DO NOT LICK YOUR FINGER TO TURN PAGES!! You never know where that paper has been.HELP!"
4,These are great but be careful of size,"I love my rubber finger. I needed to get new ones. The one I have is very old and finally coming apart. Reading reviews I wasn't sure what size to get. I got the size 11 small. Well, it is to small. I have female very skinny long fingers. When i put the small ones on it doesn't go on all the way, but enough to do the job. The only problem is it does cut the circulation. So think twice before getting the small."
1,Very confusing sizing,What is a size 11 finger tip?? There was no explanation what this meant. They are tiny! They don't even fit my wife who is under 5 feet tall! The shipping cost is not worth sending them back. Perhaps some day an accountant Hobbit will come calling and I will give them to him.
1,Avoid This Book!,"This book is shameful! This is not Taoism. In fact, it has absoltely nothing to do with Taoism. Taoism does include ritual, and some that could be called ""magic,"" but is at best a mixture of folk belief and ideas the author has plainly made up. The author is blatantly using the term ""Taoist"" in order to sell books. Avoid it!"
2,Big let down,Before buying this album you might want to sample it 1st. This is not at there best. It was a big let down compared to Del Norte al Sur and Hecho en Mexico.
2,Only partly successful in illuminating a tough subject.,"Reading this book I got the feeling that Mr. Smith couldn't quite decide if his audience was the layman or the surveying professional. For example, very little mathematics is used (even though there are topics in the book which would have been better served by a more mathematical treatment), while on the other hand many terms are used as though the reader should be familiar with them already.I found the lack of a glossary frustrating, as was Mr. Smith's habit of using concepts chapters ahead of their defintion. The difficult subject matter was further obscured by numerous errors in the figures and text (such as refering to velocity as the second integral of acceleration.)In the end, the book did give me a good qualitative feel for the issues germane to geodesy, but I had to work very hard to extract that information and found myself immediately looking for a more perspicuous text."
4,Good background for people interested in GIS and cartography,"I bought this book to fill in knowledge gaps, not to learn geodesy as an expert. It answered lots of questions I had had about measurements, how surveys are performed, geodetic systems (datums and so on), the WGS, and the use of gravity. The details are all there, within about 100 pages in the middle of the book. Not bad at all.This subject by its nature requires a mathematical treatment, so although the book does not go deeply into the math, it's sometimes heavy reading. Many of the illustrations deserve careful study, too. It's not light bedtime reading. I carried this book around for several days during and after a large GIS conference and periodically dipped into it. It works well in small doses."
1,this is a very overpriced general introduction book..,"I put this book in the same catgory as the ebay ripoff books, It's a very thin book with one page discussions on various topics, and simple cave man style geometry drawings.So if you don't need it as a college text book, then please get a better book, as this one is nearly useless to understand how anything works in any concrete manner."
4,"Good, but not great","I prefer the T. G. H. James book, in terms of photographs; this book has similar content, but it's scaled down."
4,"The tomb and its ""treasures"" are the real focus.","If you want a multitude of pictures and a fair discussion of the tomb's discovery and the objects found in it, then this is an excellent book. We used this in a grad/undergrad level seminar I took back at Columbia University because it is so detailed on the tomb and its discovery. However, when it comes to information about Tutankhanum himself there are only 20 pages that look at his life and the historical context of his life, most of that is spent on his family and the dynasty he is part of. 20 pages out of 200+?! This is why I'm giving this book only 4 stars -- the cover and the summary offered by the book itself suggests the book has three parts and this first one is barely there."
3,Description of Book is Misleading,"First, don't be confused by the title. The author is using the term ""last millennium"" to refer to our present millennium, not the millennial reign of Christ. Second, the cover states it includes ""Clear explanations for every event in the book of Revelation."" However, this book covers only the first 11 of Revelation's 22 chapters and a WHOLE lot happens after chapter 11. It happens to end abruptly at the 7th trumpet (we don't get to hear about the 7 bowls) and the author writes ""perhaps in another volume, we will have the opportunity to dig into the secod half of Revelation...."" Why not say that on the cover? Title the book ""Commentary on the First Half of Revelation."" In fact, it should be subtitled ""With Major Emphasis on the 7 Letters to the Church"" because the first 125 pages (out of 249--half!) cover only through chapter 3. HOWEVER, I liked what there was."
1,Save your money,"Do not buy this book. Mac Hammond is a preacher in my state. His church has nearly lost its non-profit status several times as a result of his corrupt teachings and constantly pushing his political agenda. This book is nothing less than religous propaganda. His message is that of selfishness- salvation for your self. Furthermore he emphasizes the fact that this life is temporal- therfore your possesions are meaningless. If you have never attended his church this could be a nice message, however the motive behind the message is that you should give your possessions over to the church."
5,the one to own,"As a long time lover of the blues, this guy is the epitome of the Texas guitar masters. I know he was an inspiration to younger players like Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughan. You can't go wrong with this CD, trust me."
4,Good light collins,"Ice pickin is a good album of the ""guitar god of tellecaster"" ALbert collins.However, it's not between your best studio works, because frosbite and cold snap are by far your best. But, it's a fine effort.In short, ice pickin show us a ""light collins""."
5,By far the best hunting game on the market!,"For $20 I do not expect to get a quake like experience, nor do I expect to have the latest graphics engine screaming on my screen like SOME people would. Having owed Deer Hunter, Deer Hunter 2, Deer Hunter 3 Gold and played demos from other companies, you just can't get better than this for budget software. WizardWorks has come a long way since the days of Deer Hunter 1! You want graphics with NO GAME PLAY? Try TNN Outdoors Hunting Sim. Aleast this one has great game play with decent, albeit not state-of-the-art graphics. The game is STABLE with little to no major bugs (unlike others I have seen).Hands down the best hunting sim out to date. Oh and playing as the deer in multiplayer games is a HOOT!"
4,Another great group of poems from Kooser,This poet continues to write about ordinary days in an extraordinary way. An inspiration for this fiction writer.
3,The Nebraska blizzard of '88,"The title is a little misleading. After listening to my grandfather's reminiscences of the Blizzard of '88, years ago, I had the impression that the blizzard happened in March of 1888 in New York City. I was a little disappointed to discover that it happened in January over the entire midwest."
4,Chuck Norris Classics!,"I bought this Triple Feature 3-DVD Set containing Breaker! Breaker!, Hero and the Terror and Lone Wolf McQuade at Walmart for under five dollars at a Black Friday sale. Its been several years since I had seen any of Chuck Norris's movies, so I was excited about my purchase.There is an error on the DVD cover jacket and the Breaker! Breaker! disc as it has the running time as 65 minutes when it is actually 95 minutes! Both Breaker! Breaker! and Hero and the Terror are on double-sided discs, one side being full screen and the other being widescreen. Lone Wolf is on a single disc.Overall, I enjoyed re-watching the three films."
5,Lone wolf McQuade/Movie 3 pk.,"It is a 3 pk dvd. Still brand new and should work perfectly.have not watched it yet, but the movies themselves are good moviesthey arrived quickly and in great shape."
4,Chuck Norris day at the Movies!,"OK. I am a schmuck for Mr. Norris. His movies are not brain candy. His are more the ""I have had a REALLY bad day at the office and need to kick some a**"" type of movie. He is graceful and deadly in his chosen field. There is little cursing and that usully tags someone as a bad guy of some sort. Rarely does Mr. Norris swear himself. You can generally tell where he is in his career by his facial hair...lol. The one thing you get from his movies is that evil does not triumph over good...regardless of the colour of their clothing!"
1,"Radiohead's ""Homework"" w/ a new title & cover BEWARE! Don't Buy!!!",Do not waste your money! I ordered this & when it arrived I immediately opened it up & watched it. To my surprise when the title\menu came up it said Radiohead's Homework NOT Radiohead's Logical Emotions 2008. So I then take the DVD out & flip it over. On the back of the DVD it says Homework on it. So I don't know if someone accidently put the wrong label on it in the factory or if someone is trying to pawn Homework off as Logical Emotions to get people to buy it. Either way I was pissed. Here is a link to Radiohead's Homework: http://www.amazon.com/Radiohead-Homework-Unauthorized-Documentary/dp/B0000C826C/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1231198803&sr=1-12
2,Not my cup of tea,"Seeing names of some of my favorite bands, like Los Straitjackets, Tiki Tones, Davey Allen, etc., I thought this collection couldn't miss. Boy, was I wrong. Apparently other people like this stuff, so I won't get too personal about it, other than to say it didn't work for me. I mean, we need another version of ""I Fought the Law"" because... why?"
1,This CD Sucks,"I was looking for the longest time a Sonia Rivas CD and found this one here, bought it and I realized they're not the original versions of the songs. Most of it was my fault for not listening to the samples."
4,"Good, Fast Read!","This has the promise of being a great series. I didn't enjoy it as much as the the first book, Rhode Island Red, but Nanette Hayes is a hoot and a half. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Missing In Action.,"Here is a book that is quick on a good evening and won't totally bog the reader with a lot of filler. Nanette Hayes, on request of her mother, goes in search for her idol, Aunt Vivian, who seem to have left a couple of cryptic messages with mom. On route of searching, she is derailed by playing sax on street corners, meeting her male antagonist, who will be her lover, dirty dives, and a hotel room where her aunt resided. A duffel bag, one hundred dollars in a jacket pocket, and a picture of a old jazz musician puts her and her new conquest on the search, and somehow leads her to the missing relative, along with the drama and danger that comes along. Straight to the point and humerous, Nanette is a heroine that will charm you and a story that will keep you turning the pages."
1,Pseudo explanations of popular illusions !,"Mr. Becker offer us a collection of inept so called secrets of popular illusions. With the exception of one or two sections, the drawings are of poor quality and the secrets are unworkable. The chapter on David Copperfield is stupid. Who is Mr. Becker trying to fool. Generally badly written. Fail to explain the true beauty of the art of magic. Not recommended. Suggest instead any book by Mark Wilson or in the Dover collection."
1,A waste of money,"You won't find all the secrets of magic in this book, it's more of a David Copperfield advertisement, with a hole chapter of his credits, along with some generic secrets that you can find in library books."
3,Be careful!,Works well on large tuner heads (Gretsch)...not so well (slips) on smaller heads (Rickenbacker)...low price makes it worth taking the chance!
2,Nice look but...,I got these thinking oh how cute! But they didn't fit! The opening is very tight and there is no way of adjusting them because they don't lace up or anything. It's a slip on! It was just too tight and too snug a fit. I returned them.
4,One of Music's Saddest Stories,"This highly interesting book chronicles the saga of one Roger Keith ""Syd"" Barret, founder and early lifeblood of the ground-breaking musical group Pink Floyd. It tells of Barret's early days, his influences, his non-musical interests, and how, when and why the Floyd came to be. Of course, it also chronicles his immiment decline. It is interesting to see the downward spiral that Syd rode. Not just the drugs; but the pressure of fame and success and all else. It is a very sad story. So sad indeed, that it times it can be quite unsettling. First-hand accounts from those close to Barret serve to illustrate these definite points. Of course, it also shows that Syd is still here, and we all must realize that. I recommend this book to all major fans of Pink Floyd (along with Schaffner's ""A Saucerful of Secrets"") and particularly ones of their early work and that of Syd's."
5,Sad but important story,"Julian Palacios' book ""Lost In The Woods"" is a comprehensive tale of a talented and troubled young man. Exhaustively researched, its only flaw is that it sometimes reads like a textbook. These moments are rare and overcome by the genuine empathy the author has for his subject. Syd Barrett's story is a sad but important tale in the evolution of modern music. He influenced the likes of Hendrix and the Beatles, and argument could be made that every album the Pink Floyd released after his ouster was about Syd.Wish You Were Here."
4,"moonshine, washing line...","A thorough yet digestable bio of the late Syd Barrett. Captures the pre and post Floyd Syd.Similar to Mike Watkinson's ""Syd Barrett & the Dawn of Pink Floyd: Crazy Diamond"", but with some more meat on the bones. Particularly interesting is an interview with Barrett's nephew, which sheds light on Syd's activity during his later years."
2,Poor binding,"Ordered this and had to return it. It was listed as new, but cover had bending and wear. Not sure how much was the seller's fault and how much was due to cheap binding"
2,Not what was pictured,"The book that I received was not the book in the picture. It was the international edition, which is just a little bit different. This wasn't that much of a problem, except when doing homework problems. The problems were different and I had to borrow a friend's book. From what I have seen so far, the actual text part of the book is the same, though."
1,Get a second book,"This book gets more infuriating with each chapter. It starts off explaining things well enough, then it leaves you behind as it obviously thinks things are clear when they're not. This just piles up as you go along and by the middle of the book, this thing starts becoming a detriment to learning rather than an aide. An example - the book makes a point, then adds to the point, then brings it all together... not by explaining it, but by asking you ""why?."" Why?? Here's a great point to be made and you don't explain it, you just ask the reader to figure it out on their own? Why??? And Poole averages one why a page, no joke. For someone who thinks the material is dead simple, that's just a nuisance. For the rest of us, its no help at all. Lazy even. Given the price, this is not a book I'd recommend for anyone, not even as a reference. If you've been assigned this book for a class, ask around for a good backup. Texts shouldn't be a drag on learning, this one is."
3,Accurate description... to an extend,"The description for the book is ""like new"" yet the binding of the book is held together by tape. The detail descriptions mentions this, but why then would the book be categorized ""like new""? Seems like false advertising to me."
5,Great linear algebra text!,"This is an excellent linear algebra textbook. Even if you just wanted to learn more about the subject, I can't imagine a better introduction. I've taken many math courses and saw this book when I was tutoring a first year student. My reaction was ""I wish this had been the text when I took linear algebra."" I am familiar with Lay, Anton, Strang, Nicholson, and Kolman but Poole beats them all in my opinion. Here's why: clear writing, lots of excellent examples, very good exercises, interesting examples, and extras (like independent study projects and real-world applications) that other books don't have.At first I thought this book was pretty low-level. But after careful reflection, I realize this is not the case: it is easy to read but not a watered-down version of the subject: it's kind of sneaky that way.All in all I give it thumbs way up."
2,Obscure writing style alienated me,"As a latino who has enjoyed occasional plays or songs that used Spanglish as a gimmick, I was curious to read this book that claimed that our entire culture should be re-labeled as Spanglish.But within a few pages, I realized that the author engages in a self-congratulatory ""deconstructionist"" style designed to impress a) his writing professor in college, b) his less-educated peers, c) not sure whom? Frequent references to Jack Kerouac, Dubois and others seems more of a last-minute thought to fluff-out or ""fatten"" the book for press time.I would not recommend this book for anyone needing to learn about the current Latino culture or our issues; a much better bargain is the free pdf download at Lulac.org website."
4,"As an outsider, This was enlightening!!","As a fellow writer of books on ethnicity, I became curious of other viewpoints. Since Latinos/Hispanics are a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population, I felt a responsibility to examine some of the issues in the Latino community. I found many similarities between the Black and Latino communities when it comes to stereotypes and Race. 1. What do we call ourselves? 2. Stereotypical treatment in Hollywood. 3. Light skin vs. dark skin (Sammy Sosa) I just wish the book wasn't so long. I guess those who are interested in obscure history will love those parts. Thanks for opening my eyes to many things Ed Morales!!Plain Talk - Volume 1"
3,So so,I got it for an old blind lady that had no money so far she has been getting along ok so the thing must work I sure hope so it was a freebie so it's wait and see
5,A True Blessing,My wife is legally blind and this unique thermostat provides the ability to know the current temp while being able to precisely set the thermostat in both summer and winter. Highly recommend this product for the visually impaired.
3,This one is for a big fat thumb!,"This size is the XL. I ordered the wrong size. But, I love these. They are nice (in the right size) Better than licking your finger to flip through paper..."
3,Rubber Fingers XL,xl rubber fingers. Another mistake in ordering. I can use these on two fingers at the same time.It is amazing.
2,Disappointed,"Was expecting a lot more from brand name items. Boxes were dented and bent. Fingertips crammed in boxes. Fingertips locked like factory seconds. One was cut on top edge. Will use,but won't buy these here, again."
5,What A Play,"This is a very exciting play! It keeps your attention, not boring at all. All of the characters are interesting. Many times we think the grass is greener on the other side or try to burn the candle at both ends and end up with nothing,what ashame! You never know what a person may become! Judging a person on the outside or what they may have is not the best policy to go by."
5,Great Play,"This was a great play I was lucky enough to see it performed a few years ago when it came to my city. I found in watching the play (DVD) that the characters played by Christopher Williams and Clifton Powell were actually switched when I saw it in my city. (CW played Clifton Powell's part) but I guess that happens some time. Again this was a great play, I'm a HUGE Christopher Williams fan, so with him as part of the cast was enough for me (lol)!!! everyone else did good too (lol)!!! Great play."
5,"Get the DVD, you are sure to laugh","The play was hilarious, the acting was very good. I enjoyed Shirley Murdock she has an incredible voice and Clifton Powell always deliver a strong performance. I have to mention Steve Vaughn, I've seen Steve Vaughn in a number of productions over the years, but this time I seen a side to his acting and singing that has made me a true fan. Get the DVD, you are sure to laugh."
5,Outstanding performance!,"This stage play is a feel-good, must-see! Many twists and turns along the way, along with pleasant...and not-so pleasant surprises. This play kept me tuned in the whole way through. A very unexpected twist which shocked me since usually as the audience we can see things coming.The cast is phenomenal. Very good acting. No over-the-top circus shenanigans. Many crack-your-side moments! Good storyline."
4,A Good message,"This is one of my fav.stage plays to date. It has a great message behind it and is very funny as well as entertainment. I was sort of disappointed b/c I was able to see the play live and the dvd is kind of different. All in all, it's good though."
2,This is not a ski rack,"I bought this to help keep my family's skis organized. This is actually something that is better suited to holding up a couple of brooms. I guess this could hold up two or so pairs of cross country skis, but certainly not downhill skis. It is way too light weight and narrow. I gave it two stars, because I think it will be useful in holding brooms."
1,this isnt a sampler kit,"i was informed that this price is for one bag, not 3. even though it says sampler kit and has 3 bags in the pic.i was given a discount but if you are looking for all 3 bags do not choose this item"
5,In the beginning...,This album was prelude to the future direction of ST. Join The Army was the separation of the simple punk motive and a step into the more hardcore fusion of punk and thrash metal.... Friggin' radical!
4,a sign of things to come,"this cd is alot different from the self titled cd.You now have rockey on guitar& R J on drums but still louis on bass.this cd is very good but the sound quilty is not that good,it needs to have a modern re-recording of it like still cyco.the music is maturing and developing but no one could see the next step""how will I laugh tomorrow"" coming next.this cd has alot of classic song on it!"
1,I can't stand it,"I can't stand this kind of music. But, because I'm a rock fan, I'm always trying to discover new bands for myself to listen and like, and I keep finding this horrible bands."
4,Rectangle Kabob Basket,"You should offer a small pot holder that would slide over the handle. The handle gets pretty hot. But other wise its very good. You can turn the kabobs over and grill on 4 sides without the kabobs turning like it does on the wooden sticks. Also you can cook the slow cooking food first, then add the fast cooking food to the basket. Then all the food would done at the same time."
5,book,Love all of Max Lucado's books. We used this book for a group study for Lent. Awesome book and easy read!
5,Max at his best,"I have always enjoyed Max Lucado's writing and his take on the great stories of the Bible. This book in particular was especially timely, as I bought it at Easter to do as a ladies Bible study at my church. We are still working our way through it, but find that he brings the events of Jesus' final week on earth to a different level in our everyday lives. I like the way he uses current stories to emphasize the message of each of the verses found in Matthew, chapter 20. He makes us very conscious of our Christian walk and the impact it has on others."
3,Good history of wargames.,"From the point of view of a hobby wargamer, the most interesting part is the history of wargames. It goes much further than the typical Von Reissewitz - Wells story. There is almost no mention of miniature wargaming. Only board-wargaming and 'serious' army wargaming are described, but these parts are covered in great detail. Definitely worth reading if your interested in the history of wargaming."
2,"Boring, not intense enough","I purchased this workout video at the advice of a trusted third party. If you are new to working out, this would be great for you, but it's definitely not for the person who has been working out for years. The best workout thus far is Jillian's 30-Day Shred. I got lean from that workout and it takes only 20 minutes. This Dancing with the Stars video is only a diversion, and I might do it once a week. Whereas I will stick with Jillian for 3 times a week with yoga in between."
2,Not for Beginners,"This program will provide a moderate workout. However... The ad says it's perfect for beginners, but that's simply not true. The dance steps are done way too quickly and without full explanations for a beginner to catch on. If you've had basic dance lessons before this video will work for you, but if you've never been taught how to dance, find something else!"
4,"FU, FUN,FUN.","I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME KIND OF AEROBICS FOR 31 YEARS NOW AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I LOOK FOR A CHANGE. I TOOK BALLROOM DANCE FOR 3 YEARS MANY YEARS AGO AND LOVE IT. I SAW MARK BALLAS WAS TEACHING THIS ONE AND I LOVE HIS MOM &DAD, CORKEY & SHIRLEY BALLAS AS ONE OF THE BEST COUPOLES DANCERS EVER, SO I BOUGHT THIS. IT IS SO MUCH FUN!!! IT'S UPLIFTING AND MARK DID NOT LET ME DOWN. HE IS FUNNY AND MOTIVATING AS WELL AS MAKING SURE YOU ARE HAVING FUN. KYM JOHNSON IS GREAT AS WELL. GREAT CARDIO WORK OUTR WITH MUCH FUN IVOLVED."
2,Snooooze,"After reading the reviews, I purchased this DWTS DVD first, as it seemed to offer the best cardio and instruction. I just did the workout and would agree it's ok for cardio and has good instruction. But I expected DWTS would have decent music! I was disappointed to hear monotonous instrumentals. They didn't spring for anything that made you want to dance so I will not be buying DWTS exercise routines again. The music reminded me of bad VHS workout tapes--so boring I wanted to go to sleep, not dance. My recommendation is buy something with better tunes! This product does not live up to the DWTS brand."
3,This is good!,"Samson were a part of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, but never gained success like many other bands (Saxon, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, to name a few). On this album Bruce Dickinson (later to join Iron Maiden) is the singer, and that alone would certainly be of interest to some people.""Shock tactics"" is a good heavy metal album although it's not great. You get what you expect in songs like ""Riding with the angels"" and ""Bright lights"" since they follow the blue print for heavy metal at the time (1981). But Samson are clearly showing us that they are talented above average in cuts like ""Earth mother"", ""Nice girl"" and ""Go the hell"". They even include a blues inspired number: ""Blood lust"", but whether or not Dickinson can sing the blues is up to you to decide.I give this album 3 strong stars, but some days when I play ""Go to hell"" real loud I tend to think it's worth at least 4 stars! If you're a dedicated fan of New Wave Of British Heavy Metal you shouldn't hesitate to buy this one."
5,NWOBHM !!!,"Samson ROCKS !!! Like I said, these guys are good. They could hang with any heavy metal band that is out there today."
4,Un buen comienzo de una historia perdida.,"Este es un disco que todo fans de Maiden y sobre todo de Dickinson debe tener. La entrada es espectacular, un tema solido y con un buen tiempo que permite a dickinson ya mostrar las dotes que en Maiden lo haran el merecido sucesor de Di anno.Sin embargo hay momentos un poco flojos en el album pero que son notablemente preciados de la voz de Dickinson. lo importante para cualquier fanatico de la banda Inglesa es poder explorar la faciunación de escuchar a Dickinson sin los miembros de Maiden y tambien poder pensar que Historia se hubiese escrito en las paginas del Rock si la banda no se alejara de sus raices que en definitiva permitio el ingreso de Bruce a Iron Maide. Especial atención a Earth Mother, Riding with the Angels y Go to hell."
4,Very Good,"This albom is very good, I think Samson are one of the best NWOBHM bands because they have a lot of talent."
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased this CD thinking I'd hear a raw, rough Bruce Dickinson. I got that. However, the musicianship and sound quality on this CD are just terrible. I love the sound of an SG, but it even sounds out of tune here. The juvenile chord progressions are weak. This is a very poor CD, except for the vocals. Bruce sounds good. Want a good taste of Bruce with a killer band? Buy Maiden's ""The Number of the Beast."" Excellent from the first song to the last. Pass on this one."
1,Cross check the part numbers!!!,I purchased the product in January 2012. The Amazon web page says it fits my 2000 Chevy Malibu with 3.1L engine. The price was great and there was no core charge. When I received the the steering pump it looked great but was slightly different than the original. I double checked the part number on Amazon and it still said it fits my car. I went to rockauto.com and acdelco.com and they both said it does NOT fit my car!!!! I realized this after the 30 days and there was nothing I could do about it. I am still amazed that Amazon still shows this part fits my car. I can't figure out how to contact them and let them know. Every part you order here should be cross checked with at least another reputible site. I hope someone here from Amazon reads this and maybe save somebody the trouble of buying this part when it doesn't fit.
2,Crappy repackage,"I had high expectations. I must have been high. What a random grab bag assortment of Blue Note artists who happen to be playing Bacharach tunes. Not that every song sucks or anything, but the album has no flow whatsoever. It just doesn't work. I sold it within days of it arriving in the mail."
4,Boys like castles.,"I have 4 boys. We purchased this for my 3 year olds birthday. My 7 and 5 year old like it as much as my 3 year old. We have other mega blocks that can be put together with this, though they haven't yet. It's more of a stand alone fort/tent for them. We have a large bonus room we use as the playroom. I may not have purchased it if we didn't have a large area of play. Best price in Amazon, which makes up for the shipping."
5,Great book for enthusiasts and students,"I purchased this book optionally for a class and I think Pomeroy is a great read. She was def better than some of the other authors about Greek antiquity. Maybe wouldn't have picked it up for fun, but I didn't mind reading it for course enrichment."
5,Great TEXTBOOK,The subjest is very informative but the only down fall is that this book reads like a textbook.
1,Creative use of evidence?,"I chose to study the lives of Classical Women as part of my Ancient History degree. It was fascinating.I was not impressed by Sarah Pomeroy's work, because of her blatent 'adaptation' of quotes to serve her purpose.Every historian is influenced by their own contemporary society. Inevitably. Existing viewpoints always need to be challenged and reviewed. (This will include Sarah Pomeroy a few decades down the trail).Personally I feel this book is written for modern political viewpoints and I think it could have been far more balanced."
5,A truly relationship saving book!,"I'm on your side is a truly fabulous book specific to the difficulties of raising a teenager (and, for me a pre-teen). At my wits end with an argumentative, ""Mom can do nothing right"" twelve year old I picked up this book at the library. It is so invaluable I purchased to add to my parenting library. I have utilized pieces of this book and seen immediate results. For example, before giving your teen advice ask them if they want it. Sometimes he says no and I abide by it. Jane Nelson was speaking to my very parenting soul helping me find the road not only to survival, but actual happiness during the teenage years. Can't recommend highly enough!"
2,A disappointment,"I really wanted to find a strong argument to balance the constant accusations of the evils of media. Unfortunately, this book doesn't do it. It's not well supported (very little documentation), its arguments are repetative, and the writing is stilted."
4,If you're a Bleach fan then why not,"I'm in my 20's and i wear this around, most people don't know where it's from and i can pass as just wearing some band on my arm. I think it's cool lol, i got one for my brother too, different squad though."
4,Good tips but tricky to size.,"Overall, these tips work very well at gripping papers, etc., while protecting your finger. The tricky part is getting the correct size. I tried measuring my finger as suggested, and ordered the extra large size. Unfortunately, these were too big and slipped off all the time. I finally gave them to a big thumbed friend and ordered the large size. This size was a bit snug but worked very well and stayed put."
2,Changed the makeup of these fingers,"The material used to make these grips has changed drastically. I've used these for years and previously they were thicker and fit larger. Now these thinner products are extremely tight and hard to get on and off. Raise the price a little more, and keep the same quality of material!!!"
5,"Good for quilting, too","For years, I've used these as a thimble when quilting. Although they don't last forever as metal thimbles do, the rubber allows you to grasp the needle easily to pull through the fabrics, and to have more control when inserting the needle. Similar items are sold in quilt shops at a much higher cost."
5,rubber thumbs,Meh. They fit your thumb and you can sort things or flip pages faster and without cutting or drying out your thumb pads. They don't wear off like the gel kind of page turner stuff.
3,Limit to the type of case,"Disaster strikes was OK I guess... I just didn't like the fact that it's almost entirely trauma injuries. Therefore, there are very few illnesses, overdoses, etc. It's mostly just blunt trauma. It gets kind of old after awhile. I'd recommend Code Red or ER3 more."
4,Better than ER2,"This game goes a lot smoother and faster than ER2, plus it's a bit harder. However, I got to the top very easily (as I did in ER2). Also, the video sequences are filled with useless information and very bad actors. Nevertheless, I found this to be an exciting game, well worth playing."
3,Me? A real doctor ?,Ha! This game is so much fun! The paitents are very fun to work on and they talk! You can choose from over 100 different cases and all of them are different. The paitents wounds look realistic. You must read and learn about different treatment processes to correctly treat you paitent. Not only is this game educational but its tons of fun! My mum is a nurse and she loves to play this game too.
3,Too Hard!!,"This game has so much potential, it is sad to see what the developers have done with it. This game seems to be more of a training course for medical school students, rather than a game for E.R. fans to play. Unless you hold a medical degree, it would be difficult, even using the extensive manual, to successfully complete the goals. A good game, but way too hard."
1,Not compatable with Windows ME,"My daughter was so disappointed that this game would NOT run with Windows Millennium. The company will not support this version of Windows that is being sold on new computers. Windows ME has been out for about a year, and they have no plans fix this major problem."
2,Wank Rock,"It was my impression that this was going to be a little different. The reviews suggest that your going to hear something that is unlike anything out there. Not really. If you're going to try so hard to sound like BEP, I think I'd rather listen to BEP. They are at least catchy. This can hardly stack up to catchy. I like Hip-Hop to take me on a journey lyrically and rhythmically and to give me a message. What's the message here? Whole lotta' spankin' too little rockin' (musical pron). I'm a big fan of some of the new hip hop hittin' the seen: Lightheaded for example. I guess I got a little carried away listening to some reviews on this one and not taking the opportunity to listen to some samples. I trust my ear."
4,Very Good Album,"I would highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Diplo's production and mixes. MC Spank Rock raps about the same things as Pharrel, but can actually rap. The beats remind me of Coldcut or Meat Beat Manifesto."
5,genius.,"I read that someone reviewed the lyrics as immature. Let me correct that by saying that it's overly misogynistic. Like over the top. And because it one-ups the likes of Little Jon, think on the level of 2livecrew and dj assault, AND the fact that each song is really smart (""Rick Rubin"" is a great example of how smart the lyrics are), Spank Rock becomes straight genius.The production is out of this world! The Baltimore club influence is strong, but with a funk and edge all its own. This album is in my top 5 all time, namely because it took me by surprise. Even those who don't generally like hiphop can appreciate this new genre that Spank Rock is creating, a electro-indie-rap-mash up. You could say that a fan of Girl Talk could easily transition to Spank Rock. Then maybe move on to Plastic Little."
5,banging baltimore bass,"yo there's only 5 yo's mang, stop making yourself look foolish. spankrock is hot mang, backyard betty, i'd tap the hoe.i'd tap the hoe."
2,The Farmers Daughter,Beginning of movie does not play. But I only lose about first few minutes. Rest of movies ok Hope it comes out in DVD.Great old movie.Thank you
5,Great movie with Joseph Cotten and Loretta Young!,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is a charming romantic comedy about a Swedish farmer's daughter who goes to the house of a congressman for a temporary job and charms the whole family. She is smart, spunky and outspoken. It is a unique and very entertaining movie!"
2,Meh!,"Some old movies are great to see from time to time. I love this movie and wanted a copy for my own collection. Here's the problem: As I look at it now, I see the format is foreign. I think access to such DVDs is relatively recent. I saw the title, saw the picture, ordered it. Who would think that this movie had been translated into Spanish and couldn't be played on my player, and that there were no USA formatted copies in the pile? I had to send it back, and the seller could not have been less helpful. Meh. Maybe non-USA formatted DVD's could be listed separately from USA formatted?"
5,"Lovely novel about love, life, and spirituality","Rennie's simple quest for a church to marry her fiance becomes a wonderful discovery of her family roots, her spirituality, family values, and a deeper love that can't help but warm the reader's heart. Highly recommend!"
4,Best for Me,"I really like this stand. Folds compact and is very sturdy. But, no 5 star because the bolt threads stripped on adjusting side after 3 gigs. Easily fixed with a trip to the hardware store. Replaced carriage bolt and thumb nut with a higher quality. Metric or Standard can be used."
1,Do NOT Buy!,"Well, it's my fault for expecting much for 10 bucks, but what a disappointment considering the quality associated with the Kaiser brand! The set is cheap cheap cheap, the metal so flimsy it feels like it will buckle like a soda can.I'd return it if it was remotely worth the return postage."
4,Good for prayers at home,This is chok full of great prayers for home use. Also helpful for family prayer.
5,What a Surprise!,"My 8yr old son REALLY enjoyed this book! He ended up liking it so much that he did a school report on it. He wants more just like this!Dylan takes us through a journey of what happens when you get sucked into a game for real, and discovers alot about himself along the way!"
1,"HORRIBLE QUALITY, NOT THEATRICAL VERSION!","Since this was available on Amazon Prime, I thought this would be presented in HD and in the theatrical aspect ratio.IT MOST CERTAINLY WAS NOT!The video looked as if it had been stolen from a VHS copy of a copy of a copy of some copy someone found in the bin, and then copied again!I FEEL VIOLATED!RENTAL!? REALLY!?SHould be FREE, and there should bloody well have been notification UP FRONT that the aspect was NTSC 4:3 ratio, and a copy of a VHS tape!HOW COULD YOU DO THIS AMAZON?SO LET DOWN. >:("
1,Terrible,Poor quality movie print. Movie was worse than the quality of the movie print. I would not recommend this movie.
3,dvd,"This movie wasn't as good as we expected it to be. My son and daughter got pretty bored with it. I thought it was okay, and wouldn't mind seeing more of this series."
2,Poor Visual Quality,"I had seen ""Hanger 18"" years ago on a VHS cassette tape. I was anticipating a big improvement of the DVD version. Sadly, it was not to be.The visual quality of the DVD was not even as good as the VHS cassette! Indeed, it almost appeared to be a ""rip"" of the VHS to DVD using some sort of ripping software; and not good ripping software at that.Plot was good, acting was good, even the special effects were good for a 1980's movie. I just could not get around the poor visual quality.If I had seen a clip before I bought it, I would have never spent my money."
2,Good Movie Lousy DVD and Digital Copy,"I Loved this movie when it came out. Not a block buster but a fun movie. The Conversion to DVD looks like they found an old copy that was lying around in box of old video tapes, and converted to DVD format. The DVD and Digital versions are the same quality, lousy."
2,Not as intriguing as the preceding books,"In just a few words, I can honestly say I agree with John Mort from Booklist. Read his review of this book and you will find my thoughts. I was disappointed.I had a difficult time finishing it."
3,Disappointing Ending for Lives of Contemporary Characters,"What eventually happened to David (Tinman), his photographer wife and his sidekick pilot? Were they ever allowed back into the United States? The English military fighters on either side of the conflict--what happened to them? What happened to Moishe's wife and unborn child? The Thoene's research and writing are uniformly good, descriptive scenes are well-fleshed out, characters are believable. However, it's as though the Thoenes couldn't wait to direct their attention to the people in their next series in the Zion Chronicles and started concentrating their efforts there instead of finishing up the Zion Legacy series in a manner that didn't leave this reader so frustrated."
1,Waste of money,This plane doesn't fly. It doesn't have enough power or lift.My son is upst and I am upset about the money I put down for it and the time spent putting it together.Spend your money somewhere else
1,User review for Remote Control Bronco RC Electric RTF 2CH Plane,The assembly directions were useless for the most part. The plane is made of styrofoam and the wing broke in two when the plane fell to the ground. The nose popped off too. This product was a complete disappointment for me and for my son.
3,Directions are difficult to understand,"The airplane is much larger than we thought it would be. The only problem was with the directions for assembly. Since this product is made in China, the directions are challenging to say the least. Despite this, we did get the plane assembled and it is fun and fairly easy to operate."
3,A few fusion rock gems but otherwise solid rock axe,Featured some stuff off this CD for JazzRock-Radio(dot)com as it has some killer fusion rock chops. A fair price on this is around $25 or I suggest grabbing a used LP and creating yer own CDR. Also try doing a Google search as I did and thus locating some mp3s floating free out there in cyberspace ;D
4,"Tenchi in Tokyo Great, but isn't as good as Tenchi Universe","This movie was excellent indeed, but the movies and episodes I have seen from the OVA series and Tenchi Universe were much more humorous and had a deeper plot than Tenchi in Tokyo. I do enjoy the Tenchi in Tokyo series but it lacks the humor of Tenchi Universe. If I were to buy a series in order I would start with the Tenchi OVA series or the Tenchi Universe collection, to get a better understanding of Tenchi in Tokyo. The episodes on the tape were great, involved heartbreak and many conflicts and leaves you hanging for more, definitly one of the must buys!"
3,Nice Video but No Praying Mantis,"This is a nice video but I have to agree with the other reviewer about the praying mantis not being in the video. It is really misleading to have it on the front cover but not in the video.The Fascinating World of Insectshas a whole section on the praying mantis as well sections on other cool insects like the rhino beetle, dragonfly and lady bug."
3,For ministerial class,This book was recommended by the instructor to teach ethics and etiquette to ministers in training in the Board of Examiniers. I pray for futher insight as I pursue further instructions
5,Very Informational,"I bought this book for my Ministers In Training (MIT) class and it was very appropriate and helpful with the information that it provides. I'm not quite finished reading, but I would recommend it."
3,Worth the time,"This was a decent grouping of articles relating to the mass rapes occuring in Bosnia. Including interviews with the women themselves, as well as some of the rapists, it paints a vivid picture of these troubling events. I would have liked more analysis of the situation, specifically within the context of other wars in which rape has been a primary tool of warfare. Also, more information on where officials in Bosnia stand on this issue. This book could have been more well-rounded analytically."
3,I should stick to Dunlop...,"These EB picks are made from cheap plastic, hence the low price..you get what you pay for after all."
5,Exactly what I ordered,"You would think guitar picks are guitar picks, but it happens to depend on who is selling and where their coming from. Time and time again Amazon continues to impress me with their low prices, outstanding shipping procedures, and great customer service. This bag of 24 was 1/3 the cost of what would have been paid to my local music store ""bud"". And how can you go wrong with the name ""Ernie Ball""? A sealed bag of 24 thin, 351 style guitar picks is what I ordered and that is exactly what I received. Pick on! Thanks Amazon!"
4,Good all-purpose strumming picks,"These are not my absolute favorites, but they're near the top of the list. They have a nice sound."
2,Value picks that break easily,"Based on previous reviews, I was expecting a decent pick that would have a decent lifespan. Not so...within an hour, two of my students and i each broke a pick. I thought that the first was a fluke, but when a second student broke hers, I knew that something was up. Then when I broke one, I knew that I'll be going back to Dunlop Nylons, which I've never broken. And I was teaching them simple strum patterns on acoustic guitars. Nothing crazy. But I guess it is cheap plastic.I had given out all my other thin nylon picks to various students/friend when I stumbled upon these on Amazon. The price point was perfect, and the reviews were glowing. Unfortunately, I still have 21 of these guys to blow through, but if they're anything like their predecessors, it shouldn't take that long."
3,CHILD QUESTIONS,MY BUDDING ENGINEER GETS MOST OF HIS QUESTIONS ANSWERED HERE. XX XX XXX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX
5,This books are very educational!,This books were around when I was a child and I'm surprised that I found this collection in such great condition! It truly helps facilitate early science learning!
1,Bag of wind,"Do this before you follow Jim's advice make a list of his recommendations and at the beginng of each month put what the stock is doing. Over several months, what you will find is if you follow his advice you will be losing money !!!!!! Be careful the easiest way to make a small fortune on Wall Street is to start with a large one ???????"
2,"Don't buy. Sell, sell, sell.","This book is a little more entertaining than his newer ""Mad Money"" book.If you base your investment decision based on his books, then you are really mad."
5,An Absolute Gem,"If you buy one stock market/investing book this year, make sure its Cramer's.It is very accessible and chock full of good, practical, but strangely ignored advice.As Cramer promises at the outset of the book, he talks less about himself and more about his investing strategies.As an investor, student, and stock market aficionado, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.I PROMISE you will too."
1,I Quit Half-Way Through,"I found the book to be mostly written about what a great investor Jim was. I didn't feel that he contributed much substance to the book beyond what should be common sense to most investors.There also seemed to be some conflict between what he says on his TV show and what he wrote in the book, especially when he pumps stocks on TV that he owns in his trust."
3,"Quick, Light, and Hardy",Great book for those interested in getting a base knowledge for investing and want some good tips from a credible source. Easy read and entertaining.
3,Not very sane investing,"James Cramer has a wealth of stock speculator experience. There are many stock behavior insights in this book that experienced stock investors/speculators can utilize. The material is not systematically organized, so you just have to look for the nuggets. You won't get a thorough detailed approach to use Mr. Cramer's methods. If you read this book with the intention of buying his low priced stock tip service, be careful. The stocks he promotes typically have meager numbers of shares available (small float). They can be dangerously volatile. They can go up initially just because they've been promoted by Mr. Cramer and then tank quickly afterwards. Notwithstanding my negative comments, this book is a lively read that can give some useful ideas you might want to kick around if you have the time to do a little speculating with a modest portion of your investment capital."
4,Good Place to Start - Very Motivational,"Mr. Cramer (of Cramerica - booya master) is about as motivational as you can get. I watch his TV program religiously. He speaks very fast and can be hard to follow when he is at his peak of excitment about a stock. Combine this with the endless stream of attention-getters and you need a guide to getting the wealth of knowledge and advice he offers.This book is similar to his TV show in value, inspiration and insight. I would recommend it to any beginner like me."
3,300 pages of EGO -- 50 pages of info,"Well, if you want an uplifting read about the Street on a long flight or a cruise, then this book will do an alright job, if you can stand Cramer's ever-present self-praise and egoisms.The book, in all honesty, may even present some very GENERAL investing strategy for an average person. The problem is that the average person will probably not have the patience to go through 400 pages worth of ""ego dump"" to extract less than 50 pages worth of practical information onto their laptops.I am sure that Cramer is a successful investor and he is the one that has made quite a bit of money, not me, but this book and any other of his books will not teach you how. Bottom line, Cramer can't teach you his ""tricks"" very well.You might be better off by actually paying the $399/year subscription to his site (actionalertplus.com) and mirror his portfolio, rather than spending $20 bucks on ANY of his books.If you want a real book o read, buy Martin Zweig's Winning on Wall Street."
5,Great book for learning about trading stocks,"Jim Cramer's book is full of usefull and sound advice about investing in stocks. All his rules make common sense and should be easy for anyone to apply in thier own investing. Discipline is the key, and he stresses that. He didn't become a multi-millionaire and get his own show on CNBC by being a dummy. No one can be right all the time, and Cramer is no exception, but he is right much more than he is wrong. And that is all you need to make alot of money on Wall Street. Dont listen to the Cramer haters out there, THEY KNOW NOTHING!!! and will never come close to duplicating Cramer's investing success."
1,Inconsistent and difficult to read,On one page he says your first loss is your best loss. Yet on another page he tells people not to sell in a panic. He detests the buy and hold strategy. Yet he claims to be a bottom fisher. Stocks that hit bottom take a while to come back. Profiting from them requires a buy and hold strategy. The writing is difficult to read. The entire book is crammed with weird stuff.
2,Disappointing book on investing,Jim Crammers does a very poor job of backing up the investment ideas presented in his book. He expects you to do what he says just because he tells you too. If you are looking for a quality book on investing look at The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.
4,RULE 14 IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS FOR THE FUTURE,"Well, at least the book didn't give me a headache like the TV program. Lots of good advice, but Rule 14 is the one we should focus on. The average guy is not going to make any money in a correction that never stops - a depression, unless you know WHEN to get out! And this is what is on the cards in just a few years if even half of Arnold's THE GREAT BUST AHEAD comes true. Keep Rule 14 in mind while you read the scary summary on the book's website thegreatbustahead.com and find out when WHEN is."
3,Not NEW as advertised,"Great book, but the book was not NEW as advertised. Several pages were highlighted with a yellow high-lighter. Brought this book from Timeandagainbooks."
4,"Wild, but concise","I am still reading this book... but, so far it is excellent. It is not for ""faint of heart"" RE: investing though.Cramer is very enthusiastic and is able to get his message across!For a finance/investment-type of book it is informational, yet interesting!"
4,good response,I purchased Real Money from this Vendor in june and the response was prompt.The book was in good condition as pictured.Thanks
2,Advice from the Forrest Gump of Investing,"Cramer's book is crammed with cliches, platitudes, and conventional wisdom. It's not as exciting as the TV show, where he gets to yell at you. That's what Cramer really exceeds at -- yelling advice at people who want to be yelled at."
1,"Over-rated, not applicable in the real world","I was hesitant to buy this book after seeing a bit of Cramer on TV and I should have trusted my instincts. While filled with egotistical statements and boasting, you will be able to use little of this in the real world.I've read and very much like Eric Tyson's Investing for Dummies and his Mind Over Money which helped me identify my bad habits - some of which Cramer's book actually encouraged! I also have liked Siegel and Malkiel's books on investing."
1,Way too much fluff,"I enjoy his show, but, like his show, this book has a lot of fluff in it. While he give some excellent advice, he takes page after page to get his point across. The first 6 chapters could be consolidated down to one easily. If you're looking for hard advice, not endless rambling, this book is not for you."
1,Gets a lot of praise on TV...BUT,"For a book that is supposed to be informative and educational Jim does a good job covering a spectrum of trading. But while he tells you what to do, he seldom explains how to do it. One of the final critical chapters is quite confusing (to someone trying to understand the system) and incomplete.Overall, while there is helpful information to be gleaned from the book there is to much razzle-dazzle and glossing over difficult points to be an effectiver primer."
2,Real Money renews interest in stocks,I went into this book with some trepidation and cynism and came out feeling really relieved that it was not one of those with a lot of academic hype and tripe. Cramer has done a really good job of providing the basic tools in giving anyone a chance to be succesful in building a portfolio
5,AWSOME MUST READ - TWICE,This is the book that should be given to high school freshmen before they start earning and wasting money. This is an easy book to read and understand even if you don't like reading; I was at the end before I knew it and hearing Cramer's voice in my head the entire time. I read the first 100 pages on the first day! This book has given me the courage to invest with a realistic sense that I can be at least moderately successful and less worried about losing my shirt. THANK YOU CRAMER!!!
3,Buy and Homework,"One of Jim's suggestion was to ""buy and homework"". This definitely stresses upon the time and commitments that have to be devoted into staying updated on the stocks that you own. However, aside from reading the headlines and listening to conference call, Jim does not disect company's income statements as I wish he could have. I guess for this task, I will have to find another book. But overall a very insightful book. Another thing I like about reading his book is that I get to listen to him on his radio, to see him in action. The combination of radio and the book make for a really good re-inforcement."
5,jim cramers real money,Very informative easy for a novice to understand takes the fear out of investing and makes you want to get in the game.
5,BOU YAA,"AN EASY READ, INFORMATIVE, GOOD SOLID INFORMATION AND A FORMULA TO FOLLOW. MADE IT MORE INTERESTING BY INCLUDING PASSAGES ABOUT HIS WIFE."
2,Invest Your Money Elsewhere,"First, Jim honestly wants to help the average person realize their financial goals. He does give some good pointers as to how to better understand the stock market and how to be a better investor. I have several concepts, passages and pages highlighted for future reference.However, the problem with the book is two-fold. First, Jim wants to make us experts like him. He says, ""this book is a distillation of everything I have learned."" I find it hard to believe that Jim can make us such savvy investors in this 286 page book. Secondly, Jim's writing style is annoying and frustrating. He writes like he talks, which makes for wordy sentences. Also he repeats himself, constantly. As a result, the book was not enjoyable to me. I had to fight to finish it.In all, you can get the same information elsewhere, probably with less frustration."
3,Jim Cramer's Real Money,"I believe that Amazon's sale page for this book indicated that the copyright date was 2009 when it is actually 2005. While the book is a good general primer for playing the market, I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew how old it was. It seems to me that the market changed so radically in 2008 that anything written earlier is an anachronism. Regardless, Amazon needs to correct the copyright date so the customer can decide."
4,Every investor should listen.............,I have listened to both this books and yes I am a follower of his show. I've been an active investor for 25+ years and in college I majored in corporate finance/fundamental corporate analysis. I find this book extremely useful in driving home the type of analysis and research we should all do in picking which stocks to invest in.At times he goes a little too quickly in his explanations but the joy of having it on CD is that you can listen to in over and over during your mindnumbing commute.I do not agree with his recommendation that you should invest in only 5-10 stocks whic his far too few but htat being disregarded this book is a must for all investors. I guarentee that you will reduce the chances of losing money if you follow his suggestions.Oh............if you find him too iritating on TV don't worry he has toned it down on the CD.
5,Booyah!!!,"Jim does it again! Love this book, Basic guide to buying and selling stocks. Much Wisdom, absorb it like a sponge and then go play..."
1,Hate this book!,"Nothing but common sense in this book! Contantly saying ""You need to know or you have to know"". If I could predict the market, I wouldn't be buying your book. There is nothing in this book you don't already know. Alot of words, no point! Please, tell us something we don't already know. If you are going to write a book, know something wise! Hated it!"
5,Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World,"This is a comprehensive guide to successful investing of the highest order for anyone who is willing to study it and judiciously apply the principles Cramer sets forth in the book. It is really a ""5 star plus"" rating!Joe Armstrong"
2,Insufferable self promotion with little original content.,You won't find anything here that hasn't been said elsewhere with greater organization & precision and with more humility. Mr. Cramer would have us believe that he is the last intelligent life on Wall Street instead of a money manager whose main claim to fame is that he prospered during one of the great bull markets of all time. I gave it two stars because there are useful points in the book - none original and none which you couldn't get from some of the longer reviews here. Save your money.
3,Verdict is still out,Book is good reading. I did not get alot of definate answers out of it. Seems almost like a sales pitch of some sort. I will try to apply the newly found knowedge and time will tell if it works. Can't figure out the url's in the book either. Some are not what they are suppose to be.
2,"Not a bad book, but do NOT buy the Kindle edition","Not a bad book as an investment primer, but the most important piece of the book, a graph of Cramer's cyclical strategy for stocks is COMPLETELY ILLEGIBLE on the Kindle."
4,New Ideas For Picking Stocks,"If you are a serious stock investor some of the author's suggestions are helpful. Jim Cramer discusses his investing strategy and philosophy, but keep in mind that as a former Hedge Fund Manager he had tons of money and was a trader. If you watch his TV show ""Mad Money"", the book is a must read because it gives a better understanding of his investment style. I think it is important to do research, invest, and continue to do research, whereas Cramer's approach is ""to buy and then do research""."
4,Behind the Bluster,"I received two copies of this as Christmas presents. no one needs two copies, but one's worth the price. People who have seen Cramer on television know his act: loud, abrasive, obnoxious. But he also know his stuff, so I found this book compelling."
3,Left Me Cold,"I like Cramer's TV show a lot but this book left me cold. I enjoy his advice on individual stocks, but what you have here is a repetition of what you see in every other book this guy has written."
1,Feeling down? This is a song.,"I am not a big fan of REM, but this is definitely one of the songs I have heard. I know it.It's for that rainy day, low feeling. The song flows along at a pace and the lyrics are words.If you've ever wondered ""is there a depressing song that I could care less about?"" then buy this and find out. You could well be disappointed..."
1,PRODUCT NOT REC,I have ordered this product for more than 2 months & I didnt recived it till today. I have chacked my mail but they confirmed that the item was not delievred to their office
1,Borrow This From the Library,"Wow! I mistakenly bought this dvd believing that because I've enjoyed some of Tyler's movies this would be a great series. Boy was I wrong. The jokes aren't funny or believable. The acting is horrible, the token white character isn't funny. The little girl seems rude and not a cute spunky Rudy Huxtable or Raven. Even the laugh track is annoyingly unbelievable. If you can, rent this from the library for free just don't waste your money. The writing seems sloppy and lazy. Come on Tyler, don't take your audience for granted. This is terrible and even you must know it."
2,Line is way too faint!!!,I was testing with them from 9dpo and on well at 12 dpo I took an answer test to get my bfp because these just kept coming up negative so I thought...just turns out the line is so faint you need a flash light to see it. The line was even very faint three days after my period still needed flash light to see it.It is very frustrating that the line is so faint and looks negative even when you are pregnant. Would not recommend to ttc experts and poas addicts.
4,Guitar lickin' good!,"I'm glad to see this classic album reissued. Mel Brown is a Great! guitar player, and I hope more of his albums are reissued. These instrumentals are some fine funky licks of jazz and blues infused soul. The last person I turned on to the music of Mel Brown became obsessed to hear everything by him he could get his hands on. If you haven't heard this guitar master, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Great track ... some mixes better than others,"For those who love this track then this is a must have. However, two of the tracks are virtually identical and the rest are fairly experimental. I can't remember how I got my hands on this one but i'm glad I did just to say that I have it."
5,COOL,This was bigger than the other size cookie cutters. Which was a added surprise. It is very well made. Wide loved it.
2,Pots and pans,"Unless you are a major hardcore fan of the ""pots and pans"" style of dance music, you're gonna really have a hard time with the extensive use of that repetitive banging sound on track after track. There are some exceptions, but too many songs here won't do anything for the casual listener off the dancefloor unless you are under the influence of a party favor. Bang, bang, bang... it's just not very musical to me. Thank goodness that sound is falling out of favor already in danceclubs."
3,FLAWED,"When I learned Simon and Schuster was re-releasing this set on CD, I hoped they addressed the problems with the cassette versions released in the late '80s. They didn't. Oddly, the episodes on the first three discs have some of the original commercials and/or portions of the announcer's closing banter with Watson edited out, bringing the run time to about 25 minutes instead of the full half-hour. To serious collectors of old-time radio, this is unacceptable, especially when the packaging in effect states the programs are presented as they were originally broadcast. The rest of episodes are intact. No idea what possessed S & S to do this, but here we are. Secondly, depending on the episode, the audio restoration is a bit heavy-handed. Too much noise reduction and processing has resulted in some words and bits of dialogue sounding clipped or chopped off. The shows should have been re-mastered for the CD release. These may be picayune issues to most people, but to others like me, they're not."
4,Really quite good,"The stories are very good, and paint a suprisingly vidid picture. Nigel Bruce is a standout as always. I found that sitting quietly in a room listening to the ""radio"" was a bit dull, and was obviously replaced with television for good reason. However, while commuting, a long car trip, or on a flight, this radio series is an excellent way to enjoy the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The old time commercials are a great touch."
5,PLUMBLINE is Da' Bomb,"I've had this CD for a little less than a year now and I love it to death! I met Joseph and the guys last summer at a camp. Last weekend and the weekend before I saw them at Student Conferences in Rockwall and Fort Worth. They can really Worship up a storm and they have hearts of Gold. This CD is the best I've ever heard and it really gets you excited when you listen to it. My favorites are Bottletops, Ocean, Courtroom, and Run. Joe is totally Da' Bomb. He emails me every once in a while and hugs me everytime he sees me. These guys can really get you into it when they lead worship and when you Worship anywhere else it makes you miss being led by them. You Guys are the Awesomest!!!!abby :)"
5,Plumbline Is...,"Awesome, I think that they really know how to make you realize things in your walk with god and This CD I bought at the planetwisdom.com student conference in Dallas, Texas -- They really helped me get closer to god through singing the songs on the CD and at the conference. If I were someone who just met christ or wanted to recommit their life to christ, I would give Plumbline a chance because they really know what it is like to be close to god, I think."
5,The best band... EVER!,"I've had the pleasure of being at two summer camps where Plumbline served as worship leaders. Those were two of the most awesome weeks of my life. I was worried that being such a good live band wouldn't translate onto CD... I was wrong! This CD NEVER comes out of my car stereo. If you haven't bought it yet, you better because... It's really good! The album itself hangs together really well as a unit, but every song is original and speaks for itself. The lyrics are poignant and thoughtful, but never verbose or cliche. Plus, you can really tell the guys have chops! Buy it! NOW!"
5,Very yummy,"The roasted brown rice adds a great flavor to this green tea. I bought it because my coworker had it, and it smelled wonderful when he would make himself a cup. This is high quality tea, and I like it more than some of my expensive fancy loose tea."
5,delicious rice flavored green tea,It's an unusually subtle flavor that balances the often bitter green tea taste. Very refreshing. I recommend it to you.
4,"Convenient, clean and nutty","I am not sure how to review tea, I don't know the vocabulary and I'm no expert but I have long been a fan of the Genmai Cha after marrying into a Japanese family. I prefer the loose product over the bags but for convenience I choose to try to the bags, I'm happy with it. If you are careful to not boil the water or let the tea steep too long it will not disappoint you."
3,Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha,"I was recently introduced to Genmai cha by a friend who's husband works for a company that does business with Japan. I was at once intrigued and desirous to purchase more of the same. However, I am still unable to find a similar tea with the same delicate taste. Unfortunately, Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha is just adequate. I am still on my quest to find that same delicate flavor I found in those tea bags my friend gave me. Wish me luck in my search!"
4,Great,Love it. Does not dry your hair. Does not flatten your hair it keeps body in your hair. I Recommend this product.
5,White Lion's First,"Being White Lion's first ablum it is more raw, a little heavier than their later stuff. If your a White Lion fan, you will more than LOVE this album."
3,"Farewell, Don.","This is Beefheart's last album, and it's not one of his best....especially coming after a powerhouse like ""Doc At The Radar Station"". Still, it's a nice farewell, and there are some interesting moments overall. ""The Past Sure Is Tense"" is the best track...although it's a re-write of an older song called ""Little Scratch"" (which can only be found on ""The Dust Blows Forward"" anthology)."
4,Essential for fanatics and beginners; warm and provacative,"Billy Bob Thorton's favorite album. Culled from the Trout Mask Replica sessions, this is a splendid return to form for a true American original. Riding the line between pop and avant-garde, the cure for the bored listener. The Captain's voice, though aged, resurects Howlin' Wolf better than anyone I know. Gary Lucas's inspired guitar adds another splendid dimension. Fully equipped with cover art by the man himself. Buy it already!"
3,get the others,it has some great moments but you should get mirror man or trout mask replica instead!
4,The Captain's Swan Song,"I listened to this album right after I found out that Don Van Vliet (Captain Beefheart) passed away on that fateful day in December. This is definitely a record that will have the listener say, ""I wonder what he would have done if he continued recording."" I suppose many answers are best left unsolved. This album, just like 'Doc at the Radar Station' before it, is a wonderful fusion between Beefheart's 'Trout Mask Replica' era and 'Shiny Beast' era, as best evidenced in songs such as the title track, the instrumental 'Semi Multi Colored Caucasian,' and 'Hey Garland, I Dig Your Tweed Coat.' Any fan of Beefheart will not want to miss this one."
5,Still my favorite!!,"We just finished this book, and the boys LOVED IT!! They are almost 7 years old and 5 years old. Geared towards 4-12 year olds, these books are at the top of my children's fiction list!!In this book we learned about the Everglades, poachers, and Seminole Indians. We love the cliffhanger writing style and can't get enough Happy Hollisters! As a mom I love the good virtues like honesty, courage, respect, and good manners promoted through out these books. And who doesn't like a great adventure in the Everglades?! And that part about the crocodile! Ooooh!"
4,Raw emotion is new to me,This book blew me away its the last of 3 books and I can tell you that I personally cried very much but I also learned the value of freedom and choice. Sultana should write more about her life.
5,Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry,"I work for a regulatory agency and inspect oil refineries, along with many other chemical processes. I am a generalist without a degree in petroleum engineering or chemical engineering. This book enables me to understand the terminology used in oil refineries. Oil refineries use language and terminology that is unique to that industry and the chemical processes involved.This book is excellent. It even has a definition of the ""Doctor's Test"" (for sulfides). I kept hearing operators talk about the Doctor's test. I finally found an explanation of it in an old dry cleaning technology book from the 50's. But when I saw a copy of this Dictionary in a training class, I went straight to the D's and there was the ""Doctor's Test"", explained."
5,This book helped me rebuild a broken outboard w/o any prior knowledge,"This book helped me rebuild a broken outboard w/o any prior knowledge. Well worth its weight in gold, not really, but its a good buy."
3,Not for the Novice,The condition of the book was exactly as advertised and I have no complaints about customer service. I am a fair automotive mechanic but I know very little about working on outboard motors. I am happy to find a book that covers both my 2hp Johnson and my 15 hp Evinrude but this is hard to follow at times. I could give it 4 stars if it had a good Troubleshooting guide.
1,Johnson/Evinrude manual to vague,This manual needs more detail on the motors it claims to cover for repairs. I needed more of a step by step instruction. I am not a beginning mechanic. A beginner would be so lost they would burn the manual! I thought about doing that but it cost too much to use for the fireplace!
1,still waiting for refund!!,"I ordered repair manual for my 6 hp Johnson outboard motor, was sent another that I cannot use. I returned the incorrect manual with the understanding I would receive a refund on the postage paid to return the manual they mistakenly sent me, to date--no refund.I wouldn't recommend this supplier to anyone in the future, so far they don't live up to their word.G. JohnsonCA"
1,Not a manual,"This is not an owner's manual for the product. The blurb is confusing. Probably not a good item to buy on line, it is hard to see what you are getting."
1,"Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, 1-2 Cylinders, 1971-89 (Seloc's Johnson/Evinrude Outboard Tune-Up and Repair Manual)","Sorry, I can not really rate this book or give a review because I purchased this book for my father-n-law."
4,In the Domain if the Lak Monsters,"I have several books on the subject of lake monsters, but John Kirk's is one of the best. His way of writing makes you feel like your there with him. I now want to plan my own trip to Okanagan Lake next summer and see if I get lucky enough to spot this wonderful animal myself. The only thing this books lacks is pictures. Kirk has spotted Ogopogo serveral times and taken stills, but where are the pictures in the book?"
1,Mostly fluff with little useful information,This is another example of the kind of book anyone with a page layout program and Photoshop could whip up in a day or so. Just type in a few paragraphs of generalities then take some photos and layout a template to build 130 pages of color variations. A rather disappointing purchase.
3,"Good book, wish there was more meat to it","As a graphic designer, I use this book to pick duotones, monotones, and tritones from when I'm working in Photoshop. I trust a printed sample of a tone to be more accurate than what my screen gives me (no, I don't have calibration tools) so for me, the dozen or so pages at the back of the book with 4 color breakdowns is helpful. The preceding pages are not as they fail to identify what PMS or spot color is being used. Every other designer that I've shown this book to feels the same way.Great idea for a book but poor execution."
1,I owned my bike for 3 hours,"I had a thicker, more durable version of this lock, same brand. Bike was OK at school, but on a city street, it was gone inside of 15 min.-no joke."

2,iPhoners beware...,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't complain for a dollar, but the table of contents don't work! On the first page is a table of contents that divides the work into non-fiction, novels, short stories. That one works and takes you to the table of contents for those genres. But those sub-ToCs don't work, nor do any of the others (for example, when you get to the Jungle Book, it has a ToC, but it doesn't work)Since there is a lot of stuff here (which is great, for 0.99) it is very, very hard to navigate. I ended up walking around in the document until I found the stories I wanted and then used the 'Mark' function, which you can jump to from the 'Go to' menu.But that's a lot of work. Guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Even at this price, not worth the cost",This is just an unformatted text file. Save the money and go to Project Gutenberg
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!!,"The title of this Kindle item is a lie. As the first sentence of the summary reveals, it does not include any of Kipling's poetry -- so it's anything but ""complete""."
1,"TOC Does NOT work, neither does search","Too bad that I have to write a negative review but this edition is NOT SUITABLE for the Kindle. The TOC is NOT ACTIVE! When I try to search to get to The Jungle Book it tells me it is NOT INDEXED!I bought this because it was inexpensive, had an active TOC and was fairly complete. I have fond memories of reading the Jungle Book when young and I wanted to see how my nieces, nephews and grandchildren would react to the stories on the Kindle. Alas, the only way to get there in this edition seems to be by just paging all the way through --- totally impractical.It will be a long time before I ever buy another item from this publisher."
2,The Works of Rudyard Kipling,"The title of this book is misleading. It is not ""The Works of Kipling"". It is only one story; in large print. I was not satisfied with it this purchase."
2,Kipling rocks; this Kindle version does not,"Here's the thing: you cannot navigate through this thing without going page-by-page. Unless there's something I simply am missing, this product is not properly useable."
5,Enchanting,Rudyard Kipling has an amazing animal sense. He depicted the characters well and enchanted you to continue reading by keeping you in suspense about Mowgli. This is a must read book.
5,Awesome!,"My girlfriend has the sweetest cat in the world that has a bad habit of marking his territory. There is one spot in her apartment that he likes to frequent -- in comes the ScatMat. Straight forward to use, I placed it over the problem spot and none of her three cats would touch it. It's as if they could sense that something wasn't quite right with it. They would go up to the very edge of the mat and just stare at it. The 'problem cat' walked around it and eyed it like an enemy. I set up a camera to catch their initial reaction when they touched it (I thought it would be comical) but none of them would dare... until we turned the lights off and went to bed. Less than sixty seconds after lights out and we heard a screeching cat. Needless to say, my girlfriend's problem has been solved."
4,Great product,"It really does the job, only problem was my cat figured out how to get what she wanted without getting shocked. I would say it helped about 80% of the problem though."
2,it does not work,"This product does not work for me.I have been using it for about two weeks now, it did not keep me from breaking out at all. So I think I'm going back with my clearasil. Although it does leave your skin with a feel of smoothness but that's all. I don't think I will purchase it again."
3,dried,my wife using it or maybe 4 nights. but she complaint the pain on her face drying up and panicked!!!! she immediately brought face lotion or something like that to reverse the effects.
1,Not for very oily skin with moderate to severe acne,"It may claim to be oil-free, and it may even have salicylic acid in it, but it is still a cream-type, moisturizing scrub better for normal- to dry-skin with only mild breakouts. It does not lather, and when rinsed off it leaves behind a heavy residue that must be washed off with a standard cleanser or it will clog pores and cause more blackheads and pimples. The scent is not strong, but whether it is pleasant will be up to the individual user; it's a medicinal/chemical scent that I didn't love, but the fragrance by itself wouldn't have kept me from using the product. The scrub particles are so-so; they're the right density but they are natural particles with ragged, rough edges and sharp points that is rough on your skin to the point of scratching it. There are many other scrubs out there for acne-prone skin that are much better than this product. This would be OK for dry skin that is not sensitive nor acne-prone."
3,It's Ok,This product is OK. It didn't really work very well for me. I didn't like the smell or consistency. I like the grapefruit one better.
3,Dimples in the Ball,"The ball is fun for the kids, but it came folded, and even after a couple months it still has some dimples where it was folded. The boys like the large size of the ball, and the ridges that run along the outside for sensory input while they play."
5,Good reading skills or parental assistance required,"It's hard to know where to place this biography of Ted Geisel: Boy On Fairfield Street reads with the action and drama of fiction, yet is a bona-fide account of how Geisel grew up to become Dr. Seuss. Paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher accompany a lively discussion of how Geisel got his ideas. Good reading skills or parental assistance required for this in-depth biographical survey."
3,"Great illustrations, good biography","To be honest, I like the ""Childhood of Famous Americans"" biography of Dr. Seuss better. However, this biography has the following going for it:+ MUCH MUCH SHORTER and less texty+ big illustrations+ cute little Dr. Seuss drawings bobbing through the pagesThis book just seems too laden with self-doubt and discouragement to suit me, and I realize that is completely subjective. I have a child who is the ""doesn't fit in"" sort, and this book was discouraging to him. Instead of giving him a boost, it left him deflated.In other words, the book is the opposite of the cheerful, fun, and happy Dr. Seuss books, and we found it a little depressing.Try the ""Childhood of Famous Americans"" Ted Geisel -- we liked it better."
3,chronicle of development,"Maybe it's just because I've already subjected myself to a mountain of conspiracy literature, but it seemed to me that I didn't really find much in here that was actually new (to me). That's not to say that the book itself isn't going to be interesting or helpful to others. What was most interesting to me though, were the discussions of his own life experiences and seeing how those opened him up to new ways of looking at the world around him.The book isn't very long and so that might make this a good choice for those who are just starting to consider some of the possibilities discussed."
3,Almost What I Ordered,"The image of this product shows it to be a vertically tall, spiral bound book, just like a regular spiral notebook would be. But mine came in the shape of a portrait (horizontal) and rather small."
3,Book was not like in the picture,"The book is completely tiny, it's not the same book as pictured, they need to change the picture! And it really has 64 pages! Not 64 sheets! Overall ok for the price, not as expected though."
1,What's with all the covers?,"Gloria Gaynor was big in the 70's with ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" and the Disco Diva Anthem ""I Will Survive"". She had some other hits that never stacked up to Survive. However what is with this album full of covers?Actually I do remember seeing a vinyl record with most of these title along with one called ""Don't You Dare Call It Love"" and I listened to them and they were not bad but nothing I would have shelled out money for. Such is the case here. Gaynor has proven herself, so why would she make a cover album?Perhaps if it was a tribute album it would make some sense, here it is something like a demo."
4,better.,"This is the best 'foot' dimmer I've seen. However, I've never seen one that gives enough resistance for true foot-actuated increments with any kind of accuracy. Either way, we all give in and use our hands in the end. You know you do."
1,becarefull,I could not get my lamp to dim at all.I was not at all satisfied with this product. I have to just unplug the lamp to get the desired results.
4,"Dims just fine, howls like a banshee","The dimming on these works great. I find that I end up using my hands more than my feet, as my feet just don't have the fine motor control to move the switches with enough precision. That's not a fault of the product though.The trouble I have, and maybe this is typical of all such dimmers (I don't have experience with any others), is that they cause the lights to hum quite noticeably, especially when you are letting the maximum amount of light through. Maybe it's the lights. I honestly don't know, but I thought I should point this out.The product is great and you'll probably get used to the hum pretty quickly. The product I'm using this with is this:KT900 3-Light 1250-Watt Mini-Boom Kit."
1,Good if you don't mind the buzz,"The case is sturdy and design makes it easy to adjust the brightness. The internals however lack inductor choke and interference capacitor to smooth out the voltage making lamps ""buzz"" and cause interference. Lack of RFI/EMI suppression reduces it's rating to one star."
3,Walk to the light...,"Two were purchased 8 mths ago and used side-by-side in a large makeup mirror. This product means well with a great concept - for use on floor or dressertop. Design is great. Construction is great. But the electronic components inside are lacking in durability. One works fine with no problems while the other, after a few months, began to turn itself on in the off mode; it'll flicker, pulse, and sometimes dim on its own in the off position. Even on dim, there is a noticeable flickering. Both units are pluged into a switchable power strip for added safety."
4,high watt dimmer,"Instead of constructing my own dimmers for use in videography, I found these dimmers and applied them to 500watt tungsten bulbs. All three dimmers work very well. The filaments will hum when dimmed, The controls need to be used by hand for fine adjustment. Only complaint is that the units are not equipped with a three prong plug, for proper grounding."
5,Worked Like a Charm,I use my hand to adjust them but the large slide is smooth and works as advertised.
1,Terrible quality,"I purchased this after searching several home improvement stores and not being able to find the dimmer in black. After a few days, the light would suddenly go out. Basically the plug does not fit in properly into the slots and when you try to adjust it, sparks are visible. Unfortunately, due to the numerous amount of times the lights would go out, I've stopped using it and felt compelled to write this review to warn others."
4,works great,This produect is easy to use and works great to dim our lamp. I just wish it did not slide in the floor so I could use my foot to change the setting.
1,poor quality product,"The item arrived looking like it had been previously used. There was what looked like a scratch on the top surface that had been painted over. When I plugged it in, the LED light did not come on, and it did not work. I tried it in several outlets, and it would not come on."
5,dimmer does the job,This dimmer was put on my prelit xmas tree. I was worried about wattage but it worked perfectly. the retail store versions are only 300 watt. this also has a floor foot slide pedal which made it real convenient to use.
3,i can't believe it,"i can't believe that this badly put collection of short versions of this great group can go for $35 at this moment. only has the full versions of dancing in paradise & afrodesia. i would love to hear the full versions of brazil, gimme some,disco carnival, a brighter shade of blue & shake it down. the others i have the full length versions. this CD was chip & i bought it because i'm a fan of rinder & lewis, producers of this group, saint tropez, tuxedo junction & themselves. they are great musicians from the disco era."
5,GREAT!!!,"First time I listened ""Cocomotion"" was back in 1977... Since then I was looking for this song. Now I have it with EXCELLENT CD quality.If you liked Disco music, this is for you."
5,the kings of disco sound!!!!,"I love Cocomotion, the first time i got it I listened like 100 times, I love Dancing as Paradise, Mondo Disco, and Afrodesia as well,"
2,an impulse buy,"why did i buy this cd? it was cheap and it had a song on it that tickles me. other than that, there's no reason for me to have it. if i should throw a 70s party, it will definitely come in handy."
3,Uh oh! Another want-a-be SuperTenor!,"Overall, a nice recital. The piano was a bit heavy, but the singing was pretty good. Rondine al nido was terrific with only Pavarotti's version to challenge. Vargas seemed to tire easily at the end of the program. Missing key lyrics and losing a little bit of tone in Core'ngrato. In most of the songs he seemed to blow most of his wad leaving himself nowhere to go. Again, with the exception of Rondine al nido, most of the songs were sung with a very standard flavor. Nice disc if you like to spend only a few $."
4,High Yield for UT Memphis Medical Students,"It is no secret that the questions in this book will prepare you well for the Medical Physiology course offered at the Univ of Tennessee College of Medicine. As Dr. Schneider himself often states, ""I can only ask the same question so many ways."" If you are enrolled at UT and want a good book to prep for the course then search no farther. If you are looking for a qood question book for the Boards, I would recommend the NMS series of System based question books or the Kaplan Q-bank."
2,Kabob Basket,"I purchased a Kabob Basket since I do lots of grilling and especially like Kabobs. This item looked simple to use and would evenly cook all of the items on the skewers. When I received the package, there were no instructions at all and I could not see how the Kabob Basket was to be held together when placed on the grill. I referred to the picture on the box and pictures on the web site, but they were not much help. After trying numerous times, I finally was able to hook all of the pieces together. I found it more trouble than using single skewers on the grill."
3,Now at the bottom of the toy box,"I bought this toy for my 10 year old son for Christmas. I also got him one learning casette with it. I thought it was a great idea for a toy. A child can draw, learn and do activities and it's portable. Well, he's never taken it anywhere and doesn't even play with it anymore. The games are not as engaging as I had thought they would be."
2,Not all positive,"I purchased one of these for my son after reading all of the positive reviews. Well, I really don't think this deserves all the high marks it receives. The number one problem with this is that it is not backlit and that makes it difficult to use unless under a very bright light. Second, it seems marketed for a young audience but is perhaps too complicated for the recommended 4 year old age. Perhaps 5 or 6 if your child is advanced with electronic toys. I also found the games to be more than somewhat lacking. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
4,Good,This toy is great but the only thing is you have to have more then one game or it gets boring easy. I just got mine for christmas I like it a lot!!! I think other kids would like it too
2,doesn't keep silver from tarnishing,I bought several of these silversmith's cloth bags and found that they do not keep my sterling silver flatware nearly as tarnish free as my older bags that came with my silver. My older feltt bags came with the silver 35 yrsago and have kept the silver tarnish free. These newer Hagerty silversmith cloths do not.
5,Hagerty 24 X 30 inch Zippered Holloware Bag,"I like all Hagerty silver products and I use this large bag to protect a full drawer of sterling flatware by just laying the bag on top of all the silver placed in ordinary flatware dividers. When I want to use the silver just lift the bag, reach in and get the pieces I need. I find it easier than the flatware rolls as you have to keep opening them to see what pieces you need. Instant giant silver chest!"
5,Fast and Perfect Condition,The Hagerty Silver Storage bag arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I would definitely buy from this company again.
5,Good protection for silver,"We live in Arizona and silver tarnishes quickly if left out, here. I ordered several sizes of Hagerty Silver Keeper Bags in which to store several items for which I had no protection. They have all been put to good use, and hopefully when I take them out of storage next Thanksgiving, I won't have to polish them all again."
5,Excellent and sharable,"Quite possibly the best introduction to Capitalism I have yet come across, certainly the most sharable (which is a feature I really like.) I would say that its only weakness is that it ends just as Reagan and Thatcher and Friedman and Hayek begin to run amok. It needs to be updated.That one criticism aside, the book is a real gem, even within a series of books that are largely all gems."
3,A Classic Treatment of the Arian Controversy,"This brief history concerning the Arian Controversy is the fruitful product of many years of studies which the author, Henry M. Gwatkin, commenced upon during his tenor at Cambridge University. It is essentially an abridgement of his lectures and writings, and naturally, it is a complete revision of them as well. Even though there is a much more current edition available by R.P.C. Hanson, one cannot ignore this one since it is used extensively as a source by those who study the history of the Arian Controversy today."
2,Reads like a technical manual.,"The author is extremely ""wordy"" and ""flowery"" in his writing style, which strikes me as either pretentious or maybe that wast the style at the time it was written. While some readers may enjoy reading this style, I'm more of the ""get to the point,"" kind."
4,A Good Game But Very Challenging,I bought driver about a year a go after playing it on my friends Dell. The graphics on this game are simply amazing. The maps are very detailed and the game is fairly fun. The one problem I ran into was that the game was too difficult. I was very disappointed that after several tries and much practice I was still not able to get to the missions part of the game. This makes the game a whole lot less fun but over all this is a great game. I would not recommend this to people who are not serious gamers.
5,Driving Never so Thrilling,"Although this game is overall quite unrealistic, it is thrilling; thus making it extraordinary within the theatre of today's xbox and xbox 360 games. IT is certainly a must-have: if you know what I mean. Just is probably not for younger[E for everyone] audiences, though I'm lucky I got the chance to play it when I was about 8 years old; but I've never played it since. But I do remember it. SO enjoy, and be sure to have fun evading the police, picking up felonies, and even knocking the bumpers- etc..., off of the other cars on the interstate. It is, as well, kind of open-world, ensuring hours of gameplay.Enjoy!!!Because i sure did"
1,Does not work on Intel based Macs,Just thought I'd let you know that this game will NOT work on Intel based Macs. It really should say that in the product description.
4,good game,One of the best most fun games you will ever try. The only problem is if you are under about 550 MHZ you may experience some slowing in the game like longer loading and pausing in the game to finish the loading sequence.
1,"ZERO customer support. Zip, nadda, zilch","Don't buy anything branded Telemergency! I bought a telemergency 700 for my mother, who is nearly 80 years old. Seems well made, appears to function correctly, although the owner's manual could be improved a LOT.The problem is, NO RESPONSE to my concerns. My mother damaged the pendant with water. It no longer functions. There is no information about ordering a replacement pendant on their web site. I emailed them THREE times and never even got so much as a form letter response. Not a thing!Absolutely zero customer support. Not even a rude, ""can't help you"""
2,I would like to get what I ordered!,"My sister and I grew up on the charade game. Unfortunately we did not receive the game posted. We recieved another Charades game and it took away some or our excitement. We were looking to teach our children the more up-to-date version. Many of the movies and tv shows in the game we recieved were even too old for us. We were a little dissapointed! My sister and I vistit with each other twice a year so, we are always looking for good family games to continue family traditions with our children."
1,Count the number inside the box,"The fasteners are as promised - - except I was shorted 3 of them. At over eighteen dollars for a box, I decided to count to make sure I received all 100 as promised. Sure enough, there were only 97 in the box. Hoping Amazon will send a refund...we'll see."
2,Not worth the $15!,"I don't have this exact slipcover (it's a different pattern), but it's not worth it to buy one. Here's why: they are thin cotton, so if the baby spits up, drools, drips, etc., it goes right through to the Boppy and you have to wash it anyway - except now you have two things to wash! I suppose it helps against dirt or anything that isn't liquid, but I found that the main culprit in forcing me to wash the Boppy was liquid. Not worth the money!"
