2,Not Strong Enough,"This grabber is insufficiently strong to pick up a book or even a magazine from the floor, and it would most certainly not work to reach and grab cans from a high shelf. It was necessary to replace it with a much stronger model."
2,Not for anything with any kind of weight,"This item is not built to lift heavy things, not even slightly heavy. I purchased this item to hang a small fleece throw (smaller than a twin, a throw to use on the couch) to block the sun when sitting on my patio. This item can barely hold it. It does offer good manuverability once you grab your item. Keep looking if you need to lift anything with any weight to it."
1,"Flimsy, Screws Come Loose","My mother has gone through 3 of these and I've now gone through one. In each case, a screw came loose and the rubber ""pickup"" pad fell off. I like that it folds but this device is very poorly made."
1,Folding reach,It lasted for one week and I purchased another one from another vendor that was ten times better. I can't believe I bought this piece of junk. It should be illegal for people to sell lemon products like this.
1,Folding helping hand long'reach pick-up-grabber,"I received the product in a timely manner, however the first time I used it, it broke, At least it wasn't that expensive. I would not recommend this product. Thank you and have a good day."
3,FLIMSY!,This item is exactly what I was looking for -- but it is rather flimsy. It works well for picking up things off the floor but I wouldn't trust it to not break if I was trying to pick up a can off a shelf.
1,Flimsey,I feel this product should be sturdier for its use. It is made to pick up maybe a piece of paper. I use it when doing laundry and only pick up one item at a time. The latch does not hold and I am constantly trying to lock it when I use it which is annoying. I am going to have to purchase a better type.Thank you
1,Broke,Hinge broke after about four usages. Have contacted the company for replacement or refund. The grabber Unbroken worked as needed.
2,Very Flimsy,"This product is made from very flimsy material. The shaft bends, both from side to side and up and down, when picking up even the lightest items. The push-button lock in the center that is supposed to lock the shaft in the straight position doesn't work. Spend a little extra and get a decent reacher."
1,Lightweight grabber,"I own another grabber that I purchased a few years ago, the handle is duct taped but it still works but I wanted a foldable grabber to bring to work. This grabber is lightweight alright, its so lightweight it doesn't pick anything up! The metal 'arms' of the grabber are about 1/4 inch less in width than the older one I have and that makes all the difference. This grabber is a piece of junk. I'll probably wind up throwing it out since I threw out the packaging thinking it would work. I mean its a grabber not a booster rocket for the space shuttle, I figured it HAD to work. Well I was wrong."
1,Gripper Does Not Work,I was disappointed in this product. It does not work properly. Try to use it and it will fold up
2,pick up gripper long reach light weight,lighter then same model from catalog. no spring tension. infurior to other models. ordered 2 got 1. very poor product
3,The Good and The Bad,"It's cheap, it works but only for LIGHT weight items. The rubber cups have come off several times. It was useful for picking up very light items and I used it to reach the rear of my RV basement storage but I couldn't really drag anything back out again.It was great for picking up the puppy toys scattered everywhere, especially those he stored under the RV right in the middle where I could not reach them. However, one day his bouncy ball fell down an ivy covered hole. I used the grabber to try to get his bouncy ball back out and the rubber tip came off again, falling down the hole. The ball sunk so deep, I didn't want to dig around anymore, for fear of what monsters might climb out of the hole.Only buy this if you plan to use it for lightweight items. The folding mechanism is handy for storing, but for an RV-er, you really need a heavy duty one."
1,a big disappointment,"I recently had hip surgery and will not be able to bend very far for quite a while. I purchased this gripper and two others of a different brand. A friend also lent one to me. I have found them all very useful and effective, except this one. The button that is supposed to lock the bar when extended did not work, and as I reached for something, the bottom half of the gripper would come lose. Also, within a week, one of the suction cups came off, and the whole thing became totally worthless. I was disappointed because I really need one that folds up for when I go shopping, but I'll have to find a different brand. I wouldn't waste my money on this model again."
2,poor craftsmanship,"After less than 2 weeks, the folding mechenism gave out, resulting in the use of tape to keep the gripper from collapsing while in use. Less than 1 week later, the handle control for the gripper broke while picking up a piece of paper. As a vital and more than useful item for a person who cannot bend down to pick up dropped items, our gripper was yet again subject to home repair and now has been wired and drilled and taped together in order for it to fit it's function. I would not buy another of this brand nor recommend it to a friend. No fault to the distributor, the overall design of the item does not stand up to its needed function.DawnMarie Twiggs"
1,Something went wrong with the quality.,"I have bought this exact product several times in the past and it has been excellent and very useful to me. Our house has nine foot ceilings with high kitchen cabinets. I am a lot less than nine feet tall.The two Folding Helping Hand Long-Reach Pick-Up Gripper - Light Weight Aluminum Body that I just purchased were a major disappointment. Both Gripper's have a faulty folding hinge. They fold ok but when you try to straighten them out the hinge is loose and floppy, resulting in a completely non-rigid gripper arm. I did push the locking button very firmly. I decided not to bother returning them and I have glued the hinge to make the arm rigid. The folding feature was of no need to me anyway.Somebody did a really bad job of attaching the folding hinges, producing a really poor quality product. When I need more grippers, I will have to find a new brand."
4,Faucet Cone Bath Washer,Thanks for my purchase of the Lavelle Faucet Cone Bath Washer for faucet and valve repair parts. It came on time as expected. I believed the material in the Ads was red but what I got was gray- that was a small matter. Thanks for the speedy delivery.Lavelle #804 Cone Bath Washer
3,Most experimental release.,"I've heard almost all of Del Sol's work and this one shows the least of their pop/rock aspects. About half of this seventeen minute piece is slowly changing noise made from what sounds like traditional wind instruments that slowly builds up. And the last half is some of Grubbs piano/singing work. Though very slow and without much concern for melody. A very interesting piece though, with great dynamics and contrasts, but very avant-garde, so not for everyone, even Del Sol fans."
3,my experience with this filter,well... this filter did not have a perfect fit as did the factory unit. it seems that the odd shape geometry was not followed to the specs by K&N. Time will tell if it performs as the manufacturer claims.
1,Avoid like the plague,"Im going to try and be reasonable and bring my point across well. Basically once you have your music on and the battery in this player does pretty well. Obviously having no screen is a drawback - but look at the price.Not how I said once you have your music on. Be prepared for infinite displeasure when loading music on. Roughly half the times I plugged this player into my hard drive, the icon flashed on and off for a while. Then when I clicked into it it said I had to format it (the files already on it had been corrupted and could not be played anymore). Now this happened lots of time. The only way to overcome it was to try and copy files on before It had a chance to freeze, which still failed.Now what has happened is that the player no longer shows up on my PC. Which means that I cant copy files onto it. Which means I cant listen to music. Bottom line: I no longer have an Mp3 player.Keep sane, and don't buy this product."
1,Died after a few months of use.,Sound was fine while it worked. Used it during my subway commutes. Better off sticking to a better brand though.
2,Don't Waste Your Money (if you want to keep it for a while),"Like stated in another review ""it was too good to be true."" I paid only $20.00 as a Christmas present to myself. I couldn't download all of my files and very few of them wouldn't play. The earbuds were very uncomfortable and they didn't last long. I had to buy another set. Everything was good until NOW, IT FREEZES. It's such a headache so, I am buying an ipod, but I should have known. Coby is a cheap brand. I will now use this as a regular jump drive. I would only recommend this for temporary use, but other than that, don't waste your money."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"1 gig is big enough for me and I really like that I can use it as a flash drive as well. Battery life is pretty good could be better though. It would be better with some sort of menu too , but for the price you really can't beat it."
4,Great for the money,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing this mp3 player. My husband and I both have ipods and my son wanted one, but he is 6 and I couldn't spend that much money, even the shuffles would be too expensive for him(he breaks a lot of things), So, we decided to try this one out and I have to admit, it was a good idea. It's easy enough for him to use and it was a snap to load the songs on, just drag & drop."
3,A good collectable,"The figure doesn't have a good likeness of Framke Janssen, but it does make a good addition to the James Bond collection."
5,a well thought out minimalist work,"David Grubbs, the mastermind behind the 21st. century stylings of Gastr del Sol and former member of both Squirl Bait and Bastro really comes into his own on this album of comprised of minimalistic genius. With the piano and guitar as his only tools, Grubbs presents three restrained variations of the same piece, each different from the last. This album is reminiscent of the piano arrengement he contributed to an old Codine ep. and more recently the track Bauchreddner which can be found on the latest Gastr release. This is easily one of the finest records of 1997, and I think we can expect more fantastic sounds when Grubbs' new album The Thicket is released in the fall of '98."
5,Good Binoculars,I have these binoculars for about a month and I really like them. I like the fact that they are variable from 12 through 60 power although you really need a tripod for steady viewing it high power which I have. They seem to be made well and the zoom mechanism works well. These are large binoculars and weigh a little more then the smaller models but not that much more. I would recommend them to anyone that's looking to buy a more powerful pair of binoculars but you should have a tripod for the higher power settings or else your target will shake to much.
2,"Decent @ low power, mediocre @ mid power, downright crosseyed @ high power.","I bought these binocs because of the price and realized I should have spent the extra money. The low to mid magnification is good to fair, but the full zoom is out of focus and creates double vision and a headache. Maybe I just got a defective pair, but I'm not gonna give them a second chance. I'm going to spend the extra money and get a pair of Oberwerks."
3,Not for whimps,"I received my binocular sooner that expected,.I was impressed with the packing and care to keep it safe from damage. The binocular is good quality materials and workmanship but the tripod adapter is very unstable,...more suited for a regular smaller binocular. The optics are fair, Not the best, BUT for the price a good deal.It is a very heavy piece of equipment, so it needs a more solid mount, the larger ones with the rod mount is what this one needs,...So you better have arms that are very strong to use this binocular for a while ,....Im designing a different mount to steady it. I like this product, but as most things are these days, could be better, here again the price is comporable with the product."
1,the worst thing to buy,"when i took it out of the package, i tried to get better focus of my left eye, so i started to noticed that a sound coming from it was not good, as soon as i tell you this the optic part of the eye come off showing bad or poorly made interior so i did the same thing with the other optic in the right eye but the same thing happended in whitin 5 minutes i had a headheache and 65 usd plus taxes wasted on a product so bad that couldnot resist even to be set up for a quick an simple first time use, dont waste your money!EDA"
1,Barska Gladiator 12-60x70,"I'm no expert, but I do know these don't work very well... I have a simple $20. pair of 10x50 binoculars that work much better than than these ""Barska Gladiator zoom binoculars"".These binoculars are horrible. After reading the reviews I thought I would give them a try... what a mistake! They seem to work fine at the lowest level of magnification, but when you try to zoom them, only the left eye piece zooms in, the right side is fixed on does nothing while zooming in.There were no instructions in the package, other than basic directions. I could not find assistance on the Barska website, nor could I find any ""live chat"" or customer service assistance to help me try to resolve the issues I have with the binoculars.They are heavy, which I expected (after reading other reviews), so I used a tripod for holding them in position while viewing.My suggestion, is to save your money and buy a simple ""non zoom"" binoculars."
3,"One Great Book, An Enchanting Read","This book will give you goosebumps! Very well told.The descriptions are vivid and told with an authoritative voice. I had a chance to meet the author at a book signing in Tennessee,He was very gracious and his knowledge of Haunting Lore was incredible!"
4,"Lots of Puzzles, but no instructions","This is a great book containing 200+ puzzles. However, there are no instructions or hints on how to work the puzzles. If you are new to Su doku and looking for instructions, this is not the book for you. However, once you get the hang of puzzle solving, this is nice sized book to carry around with you. Good variety of easy, medium and difficult puzzles. The pages hold up to eraser marks."
3,lots of puzzles,There are no instructions in this book. The puzzles are all fairly easy. Mr. Sinden made an error in the introdoction when he called the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler the inventor of Sudoku. Sudoku was invented in the late 1970's.
5,Seller great to deal with,"I ordered three boxes of Lumberloc last Friday, I haven't had a chance to use them but I wanted to say that dealing with Huckabay Holdings was great. When I sent in the order I inadvertantly sent the wrong shipping address, as soon as I realized it, I contacted the seller by email then Saturday by phone. There was a representative available on Saturday morning and she said that the address had been changed and the package shipped already. The package arrived on Tuesday. More later about the fastener."
4,lost in space robot,"Lost in space robot model from bkseller. This is not the original model made in the 1960's, its a reproduction made in the 1990's, but it looks like the original."
1,Horrible.,Impossible to use...I would not buy again and I rarely am so harsh. I tossed the box in the trash.
3,Decent unless you know Polish,"The book is really cute and a great way to teach your little one, however, I would expect a dictionary to be proof read. One of the words was misspelled. I wrote to the publisher but of course they never got back to me."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK WITH ALOT OF INFORMATION,"If you work in labor and delivery, this is a must read, and keep in your unit for a back up."
5,6 inch boning knife,"I purchased as a gift. The individual receiving it loves it. Makes dealing with bones much easier. Holds an edge well, comfortable in his hand a great working weight. Would purchase again. Makes a good addition to the rest of his knife set. Good value."
5,Great choice for me!,"Victorinox 8-Piece Knife Block SetI really like my new knives! I added the steak knives also. All razor sharp and turns brisket into butter. I like the handles and they provide a good grip even when wet or greasy. Visually this is a pretty plain looking set. I didn't buy knives for a beauty contest or to impress my friends. Knives for me are tools, and I think I bought a great set of tools for the job!"
5,"The Piano Magic of Floyd Cramer Songs, CD",Will buy more of this type piano music ~ love the relaxing feeling it give me.
5,relaxing piano,This is a great CD - I put this on for my dogs when I leave for work in the morning and they love it. It's also relaxing music to listen to while working.
4,Dastardly deeds for all!!,"This is a great work, even if you miss the origional character bink. His son Dor packs a puch and I love the reference to one of my favorite characters from the previous book Castle Ragoona.Peirs Anthony has a good way of keeping the series going by building on previous characters and their families.I hope to find out what happens to Jewel & Crombie's daughter in the next book,Ogre-Ogre.Keep reading the series only gets better!"
1,The start of the panty fetish,"This is the book that got the panty fetish in the Xanth books started. The whole book, everyone is trying to get a glimpse of Princess Irene's green lace panties, and she is more than willing to tease.The Xanth books could have been a decent read for the young audience they are marketed for, with the exception of the blantant sexual situations, most of which reduce women to nothing more than entertainment for the men."
3,Not the best of the Zanth series,"This really isn't the best of the Zanth series.I'd recommend reading all these before ""Centaur Aisle."" ""A Spell for Chameleon,"" ""Castle Roogna,"" ""Ogre, Ogre"" (although if you can't stand rhyming speech, run, run, run!) ""Night Mare,"" and by far the best of the Zanth Series, the cute and up lifting story ""Dragon on a Pedestal."""
4,Really good and so funny!,"This was not the best Xanth book, but it was very funny. I loved the part with the Spelling Bee and Dor's essay in the beginning (Thu Lanned uv Zanth - ha ha ha). I also liked how Irene trapped Dor in the end."
3,An Entertaining Journey,"Though I am not a fan of Piers Anthony I will give him credit. No one does what he does. And Centaur Isle has it all, action, adventure, naked women, naked centaurs, and even an ogre. All lined with Anthony's punny sense of humor. A good book for young men and women."
4,Yum Yum,"Love this book - it has recipes in it that range from very simple to a little harder. If you love Irish food, this one is awesome."
3,Memoirs of Africa,"I have read June Clark's book from the point of view of an ex-pat in colonial Africa. It brought back a flood of memories of my own experience of living in Africa in the 1950's and 60's; then a land teeming with the big game animals and vast savanahs and forestations. The book is well written, and is a tribute to the dogged determination of the author and her husband to create a tribal game reserve in the Okavango swamps. The hardships endured and the bravery of the author is unimaginable for those content with a nine to five job in the western world. Were it not for people of similar persausion to the authors Africa's inheritance would be the poorer.John Volrath"
2,I feel Cheated,"I ordered the music CD S.O.S: Best of ABBA for my son who is AUTISTIC. He lives in India and am currently with him. This CD was shipped to my address in Texas and a friend who was coming to India brought the same. My Son Vivek who is autistic loves ABBA songs and was looking forward to getting this CD. He was thrilled to see the CD and couldn't wait to open the same. But alas! although the cover had the picture of ABBA, the CD inside turned out to be some Oasis never heard of group. The disappointment is traumatic for him. Now sitting in India I do not know how to deal with this. My friend who came on a short business trip has gone back to US and I feel cheated !!"
5,The best Memorial to Adan Chalino Sanchez,"This CD is great! What really gets to me is that ironically, without knowing he was about to die, Adan gave his farewell to his fans through the song ""Nadie Es Eterno"". May he Rest In Peace."
3,watch out for the shipping,"The bike itself is great. My son loves it. HOWEVER, watch out for the way they ship it!!! First of all, the bike was set on our porch one week before Christmas with Lightening Mcqueen written all over it. So of course my son saw it and said ""oh my bike."" (He is only 5, so he still believes in all of the Christmas magic) I must say that this made it a challenge for us. THEN the box WAS BEATEN TO A PULP!!! The inside rim was damaged & since we had no time to get another one I had to disguise it with a pic of Mr. McQueen himself. Very disappointed in the manner that this bike arrived in!!!"
2,color by number,"This color by number wasn't all that I thought it would be. She will color in it, but not very large."
1,Nothing you wouldn't find on IMDB,"Curiosity got the better of me and I paid for it. Two pages of factoids, not 5 as listed. Everything is common knowledge for the average Crispin fan and was probably lifted from IMDB."
5,Very Pleased - Great cookware,"I received my pots, and yes they are what I expected and more, actually I was so pleased with the quality of these pots, they are rather heavy but looks great.If you get these pots then you should be completed with cookware for a small kitchen. Looks rather attractive and does not have that mirror shine which needs a good polishing all the time.I would add that these pots includes a non stick skillet. The 2 quart pot is a nice size for cooking for two, and the 8 quart is actually a 7 quart which is great for six or more, I highly recommend these pots to everyone, it's a bargin at 59.99"
1,not stainless,This set of cookware is not what I expected. It's not convenient to use because of its design and it should not be called stainless at all.
3,Questions !,How far is the lid handle from the lid ?What is the thickness of the steel?Pinzon 10-Piece Hard Anodized Cookware Set
5,Fantastic,"I couldn't believe how nice these pans were. I had a family member who bought the 3 qt. sauce pan and loves it so I figured I'd try the whole set, what the heck the price is great. Well, they are fantastic and the price is unbelieveable. I kept thinking that we would get them and they'd be junk- the 'its too good to be true' mentality; but they are strong, heavy and seem to be a great purchase so far. These pans a comparable to some of the Calphalon stainless pans we have and at a quarter of the price. I would definitely recommend them to anyone."
3,quality without any aesthetics,"The pieces of this set are very heavy. Not suitable for a small lady. After using glass-lids for many years, the metal lids are not appealing. This is a very simple, high-quality set, but not of my taste."
5,Must have,I bought this when there was a special discount on top of what ever amazon had already discounted. for $55 this is a awesome deal and the product is defintely worth more them that.
3,You get what you pay,"I bought this one last month, I am ok with the quality, but please remember this is not the one you get super quality like all-clad by paying a low price, you get what you pay the bottom are thick but other parts are sort of thin, cover is thin that if you cook soup, it wont balance the steam, you have to manually control the balance, otherwise it will overflow. Generally, even heating, easy to clean. Better than the walmart product you can get by paying the same amount of money though."
4,Nice book,nice book as a reference. I like that there are pics of males & females on most of the pages
2,It's incomplete,"If you just want to identify the songbird in your yard or the gull at the beach, this is probably fine, but there are so many other regularly- present species of Wisconsin birds not listed that I would not recommend this book for birding."
3,Serves it's purpose,"The book introduces about 100 most common birds in Wisconsin. I am an European ornitologist, and this book would be very handy when visiting Wisconsin (or neighboring states) for a first time -you know what to expect.Of course you need also a good field guide.For a normal person living in Wisconsin this could be a good choice for the first field guide when starting the bird hobby."
1,Repressed memories,"Yeah, I read this a long time ago too, and repressed the horror, the horror of this story. It's a thin gruel of hippie apostasy and neomaxiezoondweebie commie claptrap. Two thin, fit young men rolling around in the lichen and killing stuff--it's unseemly."
3,"Okay, but not as good as others","The cd is not too bad, however, I feel some songs truly drag out a bit farther than necessary. Although Phillip is a good didge player and has his own style, I find other didge players to be more ""accomplished"" and interesting to listen to. I would call this cd ""average""- okay but not stellar."
5,Jenny's life and times.,"I thought this book was very factual, as well as very imformative, insightful, and funny. I also think the fact that she went through so much when she was a kid, is the fact that she is where she is now. Her arrests when she was growing up I think is normal, because it proves that she is not entirely above the law. In fact, I think she is dead even with it."
1,Typical uninformed ranting,"This is a run-of-the-mill rant from a so-called Christian, a typical hate-monger. Ankerberg's claims have been thoroughly debunked and his use of outdated and completely wrong information completely destroys whatever credibility he claims to have.However there will always be a group of people willing to believe the worst of their fellow men...so for those of this ilk Ankerberg no doubt brings a warm and fuzzy feeling."
3,A good overview of what goes on behind the painted shut windows and locked doors of the Satanic Masonic Lodge!,"But by no means is this video / DVDcomplete. Judging from the hysteicalreview that was posted before mine,somebody must have gotten their oxgored. The Christians definately winthis round. Good job, Mr. Ankerberg!"
1,This lock is junk.,"This lock sucks, plain and simple. The key is difficult to insert and remove, it is not a smooth feeling and you have to fight it to get it in or out, and visually the key hole looks like raw cut metal with jagged edges. It looks like a piece of crap on the mailbox!It's working temporarily since it's (only slightly) better than the lock that was being replaced but it's going in the trash as soon as I go to the local home hardware superstore to get a different lock.The product I received for ordering this ""EZ-Flo"" lock was a Guard Security mailbox lock part number 127/5 and nowhere does it say EZ-Flo so maybe I did not get the product that I thought I ordered. I can't find a picture of the EZ Flo packaging anywhere to compare to what I received."
2,I wouldn't use outdoors,"Maybe this lock would be OK inside, but outdoors it rusts quickly and freezes easily. I had to replace it in less than a month."
3,Suspend belief and enjoy the ride,"This was a fun read. I enjoyed Ms. Sharpe's vivid imagination and naughty humor. The overall pacing of the story is well written. While I enjoyed this book, I must say that I found the characters and their actions largely unbelievable. Everyone and everything seemed to be an extreme, I think though, this is part of the novel's charm. It is fiction, after all. Not all fiction is realistic, nor should it be."
3,winning,This is a good family sports movie. There is much more to life than sports and this movie combines alot of aspects. Descent acting good story. Overall a goood flick.
4,a totally by the numbers sports film saved by some excellent performances,"This film contains no surprises. A troubled coach helps a hapless team and all involved learn a lot about themselves. The girls were almost uniformly excellent in their roles, and Sam Rockwell was perfect as the lame, struggling alcoholic coach. It had just the right balance of humor and pathos, and we're left with exactly the good feeling that a film of this sort is intended to inspire. The camera work was excellent, especially the handling of the girls' last game of the season."
4,True American Heroes,"I actually purchased this book on a discount table when I realized Mr. Mcgovern and I grew up in Northern New Jersey. I've also had a close relative serve in the military in Iraq. This book is a tribute to the brave Americans who think nothing of putting themselves in harms way. The book stresses the positive being done by our involvement in Iraq. I would not recommend this book to anyone against the war in the Middle East. As Robert Mcgovern writes in his book, regardless of your feelings towards the politicians and their policies, we should without question support our military men and women. I also enjoyed his account of his time as a college and professional football player."
5,250 Best American Bread Machine Baking Recipes,Every recipe I've tried is absolutely delicious!! The tips are extremely helpful. I haven't found anything I don't like about this book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in using a bread machine to bake breads.
5,Best book ever,"I have tried many bread recipes, but this book is the best of all bread recipes. Even has a recipe to make hamburger buns. They are great. This book is worth it."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this one. I was hoping for different, yet simple recipes. That is why I use a bread machine. There is only 3 or 4 recipes in the whole book that I am interested in trying."
4,Fun but takes practice,"We have had a lot of fun with this after we got the hang of it. I wouldn't recommend for children under 10 unless they are very coordinated. Use it on the floor instead of elevating it though, the cars fly off a lot and can get damaged."
4,Carrera Go!!,"We bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas. So far we have put it together and taken it apart about 3 times and it still seems to be in good order. The cars a good size, bigger than Matchbox, with extra track contacts just in case. With any luck it looks like it should last for a few years of fun. I say that and my son is very hard on his toys."
1,Too Hot!,"These get way too hot, it burns to the touch. Different than older versions, stay away from these."
3,Not his best but still worth the money,"This isn't Sylvester's best album. The energy is great and the productions are slick, it's just not up there with the classics ""All I Need"" (re-titled ""Do You Wanna Funk"" for CD release) or ""M-1015"" (""Rock The Box"" for CD) The sound reminds me more of an early 80s dance movie, which isn't a bad thing. For some reason Sylvester's vocals aren't of his usual great standard on a few tracks.Best songs are ""Trouble In Paradise"", ""Call Me"", ""Band Of Gold"" and ""One Night Only""."
5,Fun new mystery series,"I really enjoyed this book! Jimi Plain is a fun protagonist, and the light-hearted tone fits the book perfectly. There is an appealing cast of supporting characters in Jimi's life that will make this a great series of mysteries."
4,The arrow continues to point up for this series,"Series gets better as it goes on -- the plot is telegraphed, but is so well-told that it doesn't matter. The prose is accessible, and the writer holds your interest with good character linkage."
4,Good cable,"Better construction then a basic cable, but if the signal is better is hard to tell, so improvement may just be appearance."
2,Glorified phone cord,"This is nothing more than a glorified phone cord. Bought it to try to get better connection speeds from my computer. Description says: ""Enables data transmission up to 10 times faster than an ordinary phone cable"" This is a total fabrication. In fact speeds went down by at least half. I got better results for a cheap phone cord. But it was free since I signed up for the Amazon credit card so i'm not that upset. It does work great for connecting a phone to the wall though. If you don't mind spending 16 bucks for a phone cord."
3,Great routines by T & D,"Bearing in mind this is a video of a show, it is still regrettable that quite a no. of routines were not performed by Torvill & Dean. But still the staging effects and music are very effective, and would be even more so if seen live. One of the program by T & D felt like a movie and sort of envelops you in a sad mood. This video is certainly far from perfect but is worth buying if you're a fan of T & D."
3,Anyone else?,"Did anyone else notice that the ""Celtic Spirit Medley"" track from this is basically Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohican's"" theme song?"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this product in New Zealand for $NZ30.00, which is approximate to $US10.00. I was very disappointed in the amount that I had to pay for it. The last track features some excellent fiddling by a violinist and 'Song for Ireland' is very nicely done, but tracks such as ""Will ye go Lassie go"" were very poorly done. This song is a very mournful song, but Celtic Spirit played it as if it was a joyful, alive song, which wasn't appropriate. The voices that back up some instrumental pieces sound mechanical and computerised, as do the violins that back up other pieces. If you are looking for Celtic music, try ""The Corrs - Unplugged"" - all the instruments on this CD are real and not computerised."
5,This is the DVD edition that was meant to be,"My comments are solely on this edition, please see my review of the Region 1 edition for the content. The mastering of the Region 1 edition was absolutely terrible. Whoever was in charge should lose their job. My copy of the Korean important just arrived today, and just in the first 45 minutes I can tell a vast improvement. The picture is every bit as rich and crisp as a DVD should be (except for the scenes where the cinematographer apparently wanted things to look dreamy), and the sound is extremely well done. Throw away whatever region 1 copies you have and buy this edition if you want to own a copy of a movie classic that swept the Oscars."
3,Not Good Quality for your Viewing Pleasure,The story will remain great. The copy is poor quality. I got over it because the story is so great and I don't have VHS anymore. But my VHS was a much better quality than this DVD. This beats a blank. If you just want it for sake of just having it for the record then get it. But otherwise rent it and get over it. Not collectors quality.
2,This is the LOOONG version.,"Bought this movie for my wife. She loves the movie... she didn't like this version. Some of the material that was left out of the teatrical version and left uncut in this one makes the movie long and even boring at times. The quality of this ""import"" version also leaves to be desired."
2,"Great quality video, just a mediocre movie","Visually, this is a beautiful movie, and the musical score is wonderful, but overall I was disappointed. It would have been much better in Chinese with subtitles. The English dialogue sounds so phony much of the time, and the characters seem so plastic. This is an epic story, but it lacks real human emotion, perhaps because there was just too much of a story to fit into even a LONG movie. It probably should have been a trilogy, so that the characters and their experiences could have been explored in more depth. The scenes of the Forbidden City were very interesting, especially since I just got back from seeing the real thing, but otherwise I can't recommend it."
4,Very Good...BUT,This audio book is a must hearing for everyone who seeks health.But it's missing the written manual. and in the audio he is always referring to it!!Why?
4,"okay, not great","I have the cassette tape version, and like it better in some ways. This version has the music intros and outtros deleted and sometimes, some of Deepak's words are deleted or difficult to catch in the beginnings."
5,Love this!,I find this really peaceful for me. A lot of it makes sense & yet some seems way out there. Have the cassettes but wanted it on CD.
5,Love this.,Love it. Beautifully written and narrated. Easy to listen to again and again.I have lots of Chopra books and this has new material toenliven my drive to/from work.
4,Same-Same,"Neverwinter Nights 2 is basically the same game as the first one; although the interface is much less complex (which is a GOOD thing), and of course the graphics are a LOT better... But towards the end of the game, I was almost tired, wanting the story to just be over. It's sadly obvious that Bioware has been bought, and the new owners want a return on their investment... this isn't of the same engaging, ultra-high quality as prior Bioware game in the past IMO. :-("
4,It is Neverwinter,Just what you would expect from game title .. it is continuation of the game before it .. more of the same with different areas ... A few changes to the user interface UI but it plays pretty much the same as the first.
4,Great game--still a little buggy,"The game is great fun and I'm still learning it . The game is still a little buggy in places even after the latest updates,but not enough to say anything bad about this game. Hope everyone will enjoy this game as I do."
1,Sub pop should have higher standards,"It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed with an album. The songwriting is very campy and silly. The arrangements remind me of Queen only less original. It's comes off as pretentious. The lyrics are as though the author really wants to inform the listener of his deep inner struggles, but that nothing that bad ever really happened to him. It's like reading Dean Koonts when your in the mood for Kurt Vonnegut. This record is just bad fiction. It's really sad that a history making label like Sub-Pop would have released this nonsense."
2,Not as good as the 1st,"For beginning bass players, Hal's 1st book is a must. It is simple and great at the same time. However, even after you master the 1st book, you won't be able to make a jump to the 2nd book so easily. It seems a this point a lot of information not covered in the 1st book is assumed and learned. I found the exercises confusing. I already knew the C Major scale by heart long before I got to this book along with the other scales. However, I found the number exercises located after the c major scale to be confusing. The book just doesn't eloborate where it needs to. Very disappointed in this book. It looks like I'll have to get the rest of my lessons from another source."
5,Great stove.,"My first Coleman stove started acting up, so I decided to replace it. I have some concerns about the quality control of my first stove; it was only 35 years old (sarcasm). Of course I never did any maintenance on it, so maybe it was my fault.The best stove for ""car"" camping. More fuel efficient and more reliable than propane. ""Coleman"". Says it all. Coleman is camping."
4,Improved design over 'vintage' models,"I took the advice of another reviewer and found a 70's Coleman stove. It is sturdier than the new stoves, but there is a crucial change in the design of the current model that is a deal-breaker: The opening in the gas tank has been moved to the side of the tank, requiring that the tank be disconnected before the stove can be refueled. The 70's stove can be refueled with the gas tank in place. I purchased this stove for an outdoor program for high school kids and I will be replacing it with the new version. Even though removing the gas cap depressurizes the tank and, in theory, stops the fuel supply to the burners, the old stove still feels like an accident waiting to happen, especially when kids are given the responsibility of preparing meals on camping trips."
5,Great Stove,"Great stove for car camping or just to have around the house. Purchased because it will burn unleaded gasoline or standard camp fuel (basically gasoline as well), not to mention not having to deal with those obnoxious propane bottles. Could be constructed a little more bullet-proof, but it still seems like it will last quite a while. Lights quickly and burns cleanly on camp fuel (haven't needed to use gasoline yet).Would definitely buy again."
3,Coleman Grill,This item arrived fast and we are loving it. We bought it for camping and have yet to use it. If it holds up like most coleman products we will be satisfied. The only bad thing about it is the metal is flimsier than I would like it to be.
2,stinky little stove,"This is a horrible little stinky stove that is very inefficient by today's standards. Trust me, I'm a sucker for older designs...this ain't one you want to hold onto. The burners are fickle, leave soot on the bottom of your gear, and are grossy inefficent at heating stuff - the main reason you presumably are in the market for a stove. Get a propane unit first of all, second of all, get one with the knobs on either end, and not side by side - those stick, won't adjust, and are horrible as well. I went through the entire Coleman catalog so I could help you. Learn from my mistakes. This stove would probably be ok if the apocalypse comes and you want to run the stove for awhile from your burnt out car's gas tank. Otherwise, you will look like a moron among your fellow car camping friends meantime."
5,as good as it always was,"Some reviewers have nostalgia for the older Coleman and I have one of those. But this is improved and burns better. We camp out 2 months of the year and give it steady use. It just simply works, hot or cold, windy or calm."
5,I love these stoves,Due to weight this is pretty much limited to car camping but the Coleman duel fuel is a classic. It's surely a bit lighter and less durable than the Coleman of years ago but I'm happy with it. The design is super simple and relatively unchanged. The stove just works and is very dependable. A perfect component to be prepared for a zombie apocalypse.
1,BUYER BEWARE: FALSE ADVERTISING,"BUYER BEWARE: the model you'll receive is #3000000458 and NOT the model advertised. However Amazon's ASIN: B0009PUPX8 on my invoice matches the ""Product Details"". Thus, you will receive a much lesser BTU stove (14,000) and NOT the 21,000 BTU model advertised! LOOK CLOSE because they look identical, but differ greatly on their BTU output!"
2,Just OK,This planner was ok but didnt't really stand out from other ones I had perused in the bookstores. I was hoping for some unique tips (including etiquette pointers) but didn't really find them.
2,Not worth it...,Didn't use it at all. There are many other books that give just as much information.
2,A little disappointed,"Even though this book has etiquette pointers, it doesn't have enough space to write down things. Sometimes you are directed to make a copy of a page so you will have enough pages. There is only two pockets to keep receipts, etc. Each section does have very detailed questions to ask vendors, photographers, etc. Instead of putting theses within the chapter, they should have been in an appendix so you can easily locate all the questions. My advice is to buy the Emily Post Wedding Etiquette book (which I did) and find another planner."
3,Planner Does Not Meet Expectations,"I am a huge fan of Emily Post's Wedding Etiquette book and it has helped me be a better bride, bridesmaid, and wedding guest. It is well organized and lays the proper etiquette for every possible scenario. It's wonderful.I wish I could say the same about the planner. I was a little disappointed. Although it lays out the same etiquette tips as in the book there is little writing room for notes and if you use pencil the paper does not take kindly to eraser. It would be nice if the book had pockets to carry brochures and other paperwork that wedding venues are so liberal to hand out. They also need a ""matrix"" of some sort to compare certain venues.Perhaps this planner was not useful for me as my reception venue was all inclusive, but I would recommend making your own. Many wedding planners should be personalized and should meet your specific needs."
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this book thinking it had more places to do planning etc. with. It is mostly text about weddings and etiquette, all of which is available on the internet anyway. I would have rather invested my money in a real planner with spaces to write down shower gifts etc."
2,Did not work in my MacBook Pro,"Looked to be a product I could use, but I was unable to make the card work in my MacBook Pro computer."
5,GREAT,KEEPS MY WELL IN THE WINTER MONTHS! Why do I have to enter soooo many words? I have nothing more to say!
3,"good supplement, bad memories","While this product provided the health benefits the seller promises, the smell from the capsules, while faint, gives me flashbacks to the time a raging Frenchman insinuated that my father smelled of elderberries. Continuing with the capsules was too emotionally painful, so I gave them to a co-worker."
5,great for the immune system,"I take one a day and NEVER get sick. Amazing because I have ALWAYS caught everything that came along and when I catch a cold, it is a one month ordeal where I cough continuously. I had whooping cough a few years ago, before I discovered elderberry, and coughed for five months and developed pleurisy which is extremely painful. I told a friend my problem with my immune system and she said I needed elderberry capsules so I started taking one per day. After a year or so, I told her that was the best advice I had ever received and I take one a day without failure. She said, No, you are only supposed to take them when you feel a cold coming on. But this works for me so I continue with one a day...I may be on Medicare, but I do not want to be sick."
3,Conspiracy of Kindness,"This book packed many exciting and fresh ideas on evangelism into a manageable size. However, I felt as though the author, Sjogren, was redundant in his use of a few examples of the typical kinds of ministry projects that he did. I would have found it useful to read more of a variety of the ministry projects that he has done, rather than just a few of his ideas. There is listed, though, in one of the appendices numerous ideas for evangelistic outreaches, which are quite beneficial. The overall tone of the book was very encouraging and made the topic and pracitce of evangelism for the average Christian much more approachable and less intimidating. I only gave it three stars because the author rambled a bit too much for my taste, otherwise, a very enjoyable, motivating read."
4,Good History,"The book contains alot of valuable information on the origins of Ed Parker Kenpo. It is not light reading and is a true text book. The one bad thing is the print quality and extremely small font size.""Amazon Verified Purchase,"""
5,tops for quick referencing !,"The Student Bible Atlas is excellant for quick referencing when light reading,such as in bed or relaxing in a chair, but for deeper and more intense study, such as sitting at a table or desk, I use the Nelsons or Rose Atlas due to their larger and heavyer sizes. I recommend them all highly. The pictures are all colored and beautiful."
4,It's fine for the price ($4),"I purchased this book because I needed maps to go along with my child's study of the old testament. We are using Greenleaf Guide to Old Testament History (which we LOVE, btw). This is a nice, little map book. There are several easy to read maps included. I feel the book would be useful for general study. Unfortunately, many of the key cities highlighted in the Bible and in the Greenleaf guide are not included in this map book. I will keep it as a general reference or donate it to the library, but will have to find a more detailed map elsewhere."
3,"Good overall, but lot of extraneous material","The book does indeed cover every objective of the 70-220 Microsoft exam. However, more than half of the book is, or at least seems, irrelevant to the topic of the book. First 6 chapters all discuss the types of company models, management methodologies, risk analysis, analysis of current infrastructure, requiremenets analysis, and so on. Indeed, all of these do apply to how security would be designed for a network, but frankly, most technical readers would tire out reading 300 pages of business material (types of managements, types of companies, risk management analysis, etc).I do think that all of this stuff was necessary in the book, but not with the length that it has. It should have been dealt with more succintly.All in all, a good overall book, but for the purposes of the exam, I wouldn't choose this book"
2,Did not fit in my 1999 Honda CR-V,"Well, I needed a new filter for my 1999 Honda CR-V and the amazon site said that this would fit. It did not. I had to rip a piece of it off to get it in there."
1,window glide,This product did not work for us. Someone else recommened it as it worked for them. No complaints as we may not be using it correctly.
5,Weatherstripping seal,"Very happy with this product. Have tried several other sealants in th epast, but this one is easier to apply than most, and the coverage is better."
4,As described,Use this product to keep the weather seals on my cars from drying out. Really works great .would recommend this product
5,Steve Davis,"""Gourmet Meetings"" is a creative guide for those challenges we all encounter working with groups. The author's clever use of the meal metaphor makes it easy to remember their succinct recipes for success. A quick, fun, and useful ""cookbook"" approach to making meetings work!"
2,I don't know what Coast Guard the author served in.,"It is hard to believe that the author was ever in the Coast Guard. He has created a story while decent has no basis in how the Coast Guard actually operates. I have been a Coastie since 1991 and it was almost painful to read this due to the inaccuracies. If you aren't a coastie, please don't view this as an accuarate view on how the Coast Guard operates."
2,Worth A Shot,"I was hoping that this book would finaly promote the Coast Guard in a deserving and exciting light, but unfortunately I was let down. Being an active Coastie on a 210', I was thrilled to see a Coast Guard fiction book on the shelves. After forcing myself to read it however, I became very disapointed in the obvious lack of research performed by Mr. Hutton, which I need not reproduce, as many other of these reviews have already stated them. It was a well enough story in itself, although there were few areas where I felt ""caught by the action"". I have kept the book only because I am an avid Coastie, but if you can mind the multitude of factual mistakes and sometimes slow plot advance, then this book may be worth a try."
1,The deep blue is the right place for this book,"I wouldn't recommend this book due to Mr. Huton's disregard for fact. It certainly would have made better reading if he'd done a little more research. Some examples: 1) A 210 foot Coast Guard Cutter has more than 29 people on it. 2) The 1st Coast Guard District is in Boston, not New York.I didn't get far before this book found it's way to the trash. Sorry for the bad review but it stinks!"
3,Technical advisor needed,"As has been mentioned at length the amount of innaccuracies and errors in this fictional work about the U.S. Coast Guard are a major detractor to this book. Mr. Hutton can obviously write, and pieces together an interesting story, but that can't overcome all the errors in this book. Colors at 0630 and the mention of ""Charlie Gulf"" (Golf). Maybe non-CG folks might enjoy this offering, but if you are a Coastie you may want to stay away."
1,Not the Coast Guard I know.,"The Coast Guard struggles to get the positive publicity it earns in the course of it's many and varied duties.This novel doesn't help. True, the small detail errors glare at a real Coastie, however the point is the negative light this casts upon a proud branch of the US armed forces with a strong tradition of service, loyalty and bravery that goes largely unnoticed.Smaller than the Marine Corps and with many, many missions, I wish someone would write a novel about the Coast Guard that reflects our pride and comradeship.I was excited to see this novel and expected great things only to sadly let down."
4,A Deep Blue Sounding,"A real page burner ... ACTION PACKED ! ... Great story and fantastic ending ...Am I partial? Not really, but I do like the salty Senior Chief who by the way is named, Fred.Don Hutton, an ex-Coastie Boatswain Mate, spins a great sea story with A Deep Blue Sounding."
2,Poor Cuba,"I really liked this guy in Men of Honor, A Few Good Men, Radio, Boyz N the Hood and a few others,but I can't remember the last good movie I've seen him in, unfortunately."
2,Not even close to a 5 star in my opinion,"We need to start out with this film has the feel of a low budget made for TV type of thing. That is not always bad but this movie started out too slow for my tastes and even though I like Liotta and Gooding I did not like this one. The cinematography was a little rough and the cuts were out of place at times. The story was not a bad one and this movie could have been a lot better but it falls short. I do not think this movie is worthy of 4 or 5 stars it is a 3 at best, I gave it 2.5."
2,only if this kind of action is what you want,"this is a low budget action film in which the part of america is played by eastern europe. it 's competently made but there are much better action/crime movies out there, if you've seen them this isn't bad."
5,"Superb, comprehensive, lively!","I really don't think anyone could ask for a better introduction to the how, the who, the why, the when of DJing. Reighley has definitely done his homework, as demonstrated from both the thorough retelling of DJ history and the numerous interviews with top-flight DJs, and that's exactly what I expected considering his past work. What really took me by surprise was the wealth of information he gathered (again, mostly from interviews with Big Name DJs mixed with his own experience) for those interested in starting out as DJs, from selection of mics and mixers to tips on establishing and maintaining a vinyl arsenal. And the fact that I enjoyed reading this so...much even though I have no interest in being a DJ myself speaks well of the quality of writing and the numerous insights into the nature of modern dance music."
3,Beginers Only,"I've been spining records for well over 15 years in one of the hardest and most competitive markets in the USA(SF,Ca). It is a good book for the clueless DJ, but I wish there where more profiles of the Pioneering and Independent Blue collar DJ's less on the DJ as part of a band(DJ with a major label contract). And where is the LARRY LEVAN, WALTER GIBBONS, RON HARDY, FRANKIE, TONY, JELLYBEAN and GRANDMASTER FLASH profiles, ommiting these guys is a sin. Also the author should have included a section on the DJ as producer (D.I.T.C. crew). The words of wisdom by Fracios K and David Mancuso are the only redeaming factors of this book. It seems this book has a hidden agenda, promote dj's who are who don't need it. Most of the profiles and quotes are from New Schoolers who were never into music until they took there first ""E"" (Dj Rap). This book has a good idea but it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the craft."
3,Great Light Reading.,"This book is great for picking up between breaks from spinning, or for reading on the way to work on the train while you think about your turntables at home, but it's not an in-depth account of DJing like ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life.""I felt the author was enthusiastic about the music and was knowledgeable of its history, but the ""Meet the DJ"" sections and the hundreds of quotes sometimes hindered the flow of the mix.I consider this book a companion to other DJ books."
1,I expected more!,"For those wishing a more comprehensive history on DJ culture, you will be better served by reading ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"". I expected a lot more from this book, although I did like the informal structure of the book as it reads as if the author was having a conversation with a room full of DJs. But it contains so many DJ's that no one has ever heard of...and I get the feeling that the nightclub DJ is not well represented...nor is the music industry itself. The section on record pools is abysmal! After 27 years in the music industry, I may be a little jaded, but I expect a person to at least get it right."
5,An excellent buy!,"Wow. What an awesome book. I don't like reading that much, but when I saw this book about being a DJ, and being a DJ myself, I had to read it! It was totally worth it.Buy this book!"
3,A Good Training Tool,"A step by step guide to making a sample wing section and book end.Fairly basic information and good step by step proceedures on the before mentioned projects. If you realy want to learn anything on composites, other then how to make a book end, there are a lot of other good books out there."
3,"Warm, but small","I liked the style, but I thought the boot ran small. I intentionally bought a 1/2 size larger and they fit as if they were a shoe, not a boot."
2,Unpleasant scarring remains,"After wearing these boots for just one day, my calves are left scarred because the inside lining is too rough for my skin even though I had on a pair of long socks that were soft."
3,2nd Attempt for Kent,"After the success of 'Isola' outside of their home country Sweden Kent release their 2nd album for a major label.This time around they recorded some more uptempo songs influenced by the 80s electro-rock sound of bands such as Depeche Mode and New Order.But don't forget of course to include their melodic,mid tempo ballads,that made them famous the first time around.The problem is that this album faces the same problem with 'Isola'.It kind of reminds me of the title of the Sum41 album(a band that i don't really like by the way) 'All Killer,No Filler' except that the good songs aren't 'killers' and that there are lots of fillers.Having said that i will say the same things that i said in my 'Isola' review.They write nice sounding songs but that's it.There aren't any surprises here and that's why after a while you get tired and stop listening to the album and move on with the next one.At least that's what i did!"
2,not bad but nothing new,"if you like Radiohead, you will love this album the first hour. But after several listening, I understood that this music sounds like Radiohead but it's really less innovative. So finally, I don't see the interest of this CD. Don't buy it..."
2,sooooo disapponited,"i have such a high hope after one of my fav.all time album of KENT""isola"",but this latest album turned out to be so common pop rock without style.where has the old beautiful&touching sound of KENT gone to? too bad.."
4,Heavenly junkies,"When reading reviews about Kent, they are often compared to groups like Radiohead and Muse. With all respect they are great but kent has, like alot of scandinavian bands created their own unique sound. Hagnesta Hill is a poetry floating over layers of guitars. Music non stop, as well as Heavenly junkie and just like money, is your typical first single and it works great main stream, but it's songs like revolution, rollercoasterkevlar soul and wistler song that goes straight to the heart. No one can say that kent is not a great band. Listen and love. It is a great follow up to their masterpiece ""Isola"""
4,where is the real kent???,"This is not the real Kent. This is not like isola,verkligen and kent.But it's not to bad. I like Revolt 3,Music non stop,the king is dead and En himelsk drog.En himelsk drog Music non stop the king is dead and revolt 3 is the real kentthats the reson i give them 4 stars"
5,alldeles alldeles underbar,"This is a great album by Kent, the lyrics is poetry. You should listen to it in swedish!"
4,The king is not quite dead,"The impossability of following up the brilliant ""Isola"" makes this an almost mediocre album, but not quite. ""The king is dead"" and ""Music non stop"" puts me in the same mood as Kent have done so many times before. There is no reason not to buy this one unless you expect it to be better than the previous album. Enjoy!"
3,Expensive for nothing,"The book quality is good the cover and papers are ok, the problem is the price with relation to the material inside.The book is too expensive for what you get from it, there is many other books with the same subjects inside with less money.This book can be useful if you are starting to learn the quality assurance."
2,A real snoozer.,"Don't get me wrong,because this is my personal opinion on the book, but this book was boring."
5,Metaphor For Our Time,"Martin Prechtel is perhaps the most capable of sacred story telling of today's authors. His respect for the power of language is immense and this book where he is retelling an ancient Mayan myth as it parallels his own experience is stunning in its capacity to illuminate todays world in all its contrasts. It is the third in an autobiographical trilogy. However, if you have not yet read the first two, don't worry, it stands completely on its own. This book was previously released under the title ""The Toe Bone and the Tooth""."
5,Very nice,"Used it on my old dr350s to update the looks on the poor old thing. Looks much better! !Better much looks it doesmade of plastic, some use it on their gf, I used it on my motorcycle. Not sure if I am going to call it in the morning though."
5,AWESOME,"I own 2 of these already; tried the INTEC ones & there is NO comparison! This one is absolutely the best by far! The INTEC ones are cheap & are not as well made as these are, and fit the games WAY better! I would highly recommend these over any of the others out there!!"
3,Could have been a 5 star DVD,"Excellent in all regards except perhaps the most crucial; the sound quality. It's priceless footage of these masters of Thrash with the late, great, Paul Baloff, playing their best songs. A must for any fan of Thrash metal. The only unfortunate thing is the quality of the audio otherwise it would be a 5 star DVD. Concert footage of bands from the 80's is hard to come by (much less decent one) and so this double DVD is a welcomed addition to the selection pool even with it's shortcomings. The liner notes tell you upfront, ""we are releasing these shows warts and all"" and in the end I'm glad they did because this type of material belongs in the hands of the fans! Thank you EXODUS."
3,Poor editing during the 97 show,"The 85 show is raw as expected and cool to see the guys back in their heyday. As for the 97 show, the sound and video quality is good, but the video editing is horrible in my opinion. 90% of the non-stop back-n-forth camera shots are of Rick and Tom. I'm wondering if a close relative of Rick was in charge of the mixing. Nothing against Rick, he totally shreds but there was hardly any long footage of Jack or Gary. And when the guitar solos come out, the camera continues to flip back and forth between the other band members. Come on! I want to see them fingering those solos! I'm totally disappointed in the editing. I wish someone would re-mix that show."
1,gagne tracemaster JUNK! Zero stars,"Do not Buy! The first time I used it the lens fell out. The lens tube is extremly hard to focus.The fan is to small. After using it for 30 minutesthe plastic housing started to melt!! The bracket that hold the lens tubeseperated at the joints allowing the lens tube to fall out. Do not buy this thing it works poorly, falls appart and is a fire hazzard. I can notunderstand how this product is allowed to be sold by anyone. Do not waste your money."
4,THIS IS NOT PLUSH KONG?,"THIS TOY IS NOT TITLED CORRECTLY ON THIS PAGE. THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE ""ELECTRONIC SUPREME KONG""."
4,Pretty good toy.,This king kong toy is pretty fun. It doesnt walk very well and his eyes are always looking up. His arms move well and he looks realistic. Overall it is a pretty good toy.
2,Inaccurate measure...,"Like the previous reviewer, I used these measuring cups for a long time (a couple of years!) before realizing that the measures are inaccurate. I think maybe it has something to do with the little lip/spout (maybe you're supposed to fill up to that point but not all the way?), but there are no lines or indications of any kind so who knows... The cups are durable and well-constructed and very cute (thus the two stars), but pretty much useless for cooking."
5,Best Measuring Cups!,I received these measuring cups as a graduation gift. I would recommend them to any college student or anyone else. They have held up through thick and thin. I have put mine in the dishwasher and they have came out nice for a long time. They are worth every penny! I would recommend this to anyone who wants STYLISH cookware that meets ACCURATE measurements.
1,Angry Opinions Masquerading as History,"I enjoy reading history and I purchased this book to enrich my understanding of Latin American history.The major flaw with this book was that it becomes more and more of an angry rant as it progresses. It started off rather objectively but eventually begins to attribute any and all of Latin America's problems to the evil workings of the wicked United States (Europe is sometimes blamed).I don't intend to say that the history of US involvement in Latin America has always been benign, but it is complex. The author does not seem to acknowledge this complexity.Additionally I would like to have seen a bit more emphasis on how specific countries have deviated from historical trends."
4,Latin American Nutshell,"Chasteen does a wonderful job explaining most of the history of Latin America. Though a history compilation, Born in Blood and Fire reads almost as a narrative. A quick and simple read that is a must have for any Latin American novice. My only complaint is that he sometimes skims over the history of a few of the smaller nations. This can incorrectly send the reader a message of insignificance."
4,Good,"This is a good book. I read it for my class. So far, I like it. As the title says, the book presents a ""concise"" historical account of Latin America--from Havana to Ushuais, from Lima to Rio de Janeiro. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Latin America."
3,Speedy mailing,"Speedy mailing. I needed this book for my college Latin American History course, after it was stolen at work. I received the book much quicker then expected. But it was a little more ""used"" than I was expecting."
4,One of the most shocking books i've read,"This is one of the most shocking true crime books that i have read yet.You can't even begin to fathom what happened to this poor girl.An excellent true crime book, but not easy reading and will def shock you"
3,Shocking true story,This book is written from the actual court transcripts which I thought was awesome. It's very horrifying. The book itself is very cheap looking. It's made entirely of paper and it's held together by a few metal things in the books spine. The story is what really matters though and it's a very intense one. Good book but poor quality.
3,why is the paperback $23?,I went to order this book as it seems from the reviews it may be pretty good. I was shocked to see a price of $23 for a paperback. what's up with that?
4,I Enjoy This,"I enjoy this bible holder. I keep my AMP/KJV parellel in it with about 4 hard back journals 3 highlighters and 3 pens.The colors on the front however don't moove me. I thought my eyes were going bad. If you like sandy grain colors, you'll love this.Other than that, I'm glad to have this bible carrier.This is a personal preference type of purchase in my opinion"
5,Fun Game for the Whole Family,This electronic game is a thrill to play. You can play individually or with up to 6 friends.....I just love the laughs and the fun that it creates. I got the game when I was really young as a christmas gift. My siblings and I played and played the game....and I just bought one now years later. Even though I am a lot older it still is entertaining. It is a perfect game for the whole family! :)
3,"Like the product, Instructions worthless","Bought as a xmas gift and couldn't have put in on the seats w/o help; then it took almost 2 1/2 hours. The instructions were useless, I think they actually belonged to another product. All I can hope for is that these will last as long as the others I bought."
5,Doesn't test on animals,"I love the products offered by this company because they don't test on animals. I found a list on the PETA website that told me all of the companys that are animal friendly and I'm doing my best to purchase products from that list. The products from this line are also not bleached which I heard can cause you to bleed more. It's bad enough to have products that impact the environment in a negative way, why would I want to put it so close to my body."
5,Comprehensive and Perfect,"One stop shopping for anything that you need to know about travel and anything associated with it in the ancient world. A good deal of the focus is on Greek and Roman times however there are great pieces on Egypt and Christian Rome.Absolutely no complaints. It is intended for the scholar so there isn't background info for historical people/places other than in terms of what it meant for travel. Though intended for the scholar, the writing style is concise and accessible for even just the merely interested."
3,1113,"Since she had left her husband Carne Radley, Lesly had had a hard struggle to bring up her small son Jeremy and hold down a full-time job - but somehow she had managed it. But all the time, at the back of her mind had been the nagging fear that one day Carne might want to have more say in his son's upbringing. Now that moment had come, and she and Jeremy were to go to Yorkshire to spend a summer holiday on Carne's farm. And to the dread of losing Jeremy was now added the realization that, despite their estrangement, she was still attracted to Carne. But she was no more welcome in his home now than she had been before..."
5,Look it's me--I see,"I think this toy is incredibility educational for children. I bought it for my grandson for Christmas--he was almost 5 months old. He loves it. It is one of his favorite toys. Not only does it play music, light up, teaches songs, he has learned coordination from the microphone, bottons, levers, and other knobs on the toy. It has also taught him cause and effect. The thing I love most about it through is how he can explore himself. He looks in the mirror and takes notice to his eyes, mouth, nose, ears, etc. I think sometimes he thinks he has a friend playing with him. He plays with this toy for long periods of time and is extremely content and laughs, gibber gabbers, and dances."
4,Amazing toy,"This toy is worth all the money. Some people might think this is just a glorified mirror. Well that is true, but some how my one year old daughter really enjoys playing with it. She can sit infront of the toy for more than half an hour and enjoy the different music. I'm sure she'll sing and dance along as she grows up."
4,Grandchild loves it.,"Our grandson loves this toy. He ""wiggles"" and dances to the music and loves the mirror too. It went together easy and has stood up to a one-year-old for over a month now. I recommend it highly."
2,A Waste of money,"I bought this after reading several positive reviews, but I am very disappointed in it. First, I had to return the first one because the ""mirror"" was damaged. Then, when we tried out the item, it is very lame. It only plays a clip of the songs and even then, it cuts out near the end....I guess it is supposed to be a fade out effect, but not fun when you are a toddler and enjoy hearing more of the same not less. Finally, the only reason I was drawn to this item is because of the microphone. Lots of toys have one, but this one had one of its own that you can walk around with and not have to hear the little songs on the unit.....well, it is not even a microphone. It is a rattle. My daughter loves to hear her voice being amplified, I could have done better handing her a hairbrush!!!!! Anyway, not at all what I thought it was going to be."
2,Pointless and a Waste of Space and Money,"This toy is kind of unnecessary given that there are so many other musical toys out there that are way better. It only has 5 songs and you can by toys with double or even triple that for less money. Also, the jazz sounds on this are really irritating. The microphone rattle is really all my kids play with on this. It takes up a lot of room also for the little it does. I basically payed quite a bit for a rattling microphone."
1,Spanish??,"I bought this for my niece and the music in the one sent to her plays in Spanish...she does not speak Spanish, nor does the product description indicate this may arrive in Spanish. When my brother called to ask about exchanging it (to what number I have no idea because I can't find a way to contact anyone!), they said that was not possible. The paperwork and box were all in English, but not the music. Just a warning that this may happen to you! Otherwise, she LOVES it!"
1,gave my son A BLACK EYE,"I bought this toy for my son, the part with the microphone attachment is sharp and the table is very unsteady. He can easily topple it over while trying to brace himself, while he looks in the mirror. He toppled it over and recieved a bruise under his eye. I wouldnt recommend this because I believe that a well put together childrens today shouldnt need constant supervision. No Good is my vote."
5,Tons of entertainment,I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old and would sit him in his bumbo seat in front of it. He loved it then and still loves it now that he can sit and stand on his own. He smiles every time he plays with it. He loves looking at himself in the mirror and banging on all the buttons to play music. He now uses it to help himself stand up. So worth every penny!
5,Great toy,"We bought this for my one year old son for Christmas. He loves it, loves the music, the mirror. My two year old son also seemed to enjoy it. I would highly recommend this one!"
4,Fun Sing-Along Toddler Toy,"Saw the commercial of this product one day and decided to purchase. I thought it would be good fun for my nephew. Sure enough, it was. It was worth it to see the smile on his face while he was playing with it."
4,Superstar Fun!,"This toy is probably my daughter's favorite of anything we've bought her. She loves bopping along to the music and watching the lights but, more than anything, she loves watching herself in the mirror as most babies do. She drags the ""microphone"" (morocco) with her everywhere she goes. The only negative comment I have about this toy is that it will slide easily if the baby is standing up and holding onto it for balance."
5,"Still fun, one year later!","We bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She's now almost two, and she still loves to play with it. At first she loved the music and the little people that would pop up, now she loves getting it to play different instruments and she loves *LOVES* looking in the mirror. This is still in great shape despite living in my living room for a year of heavy usage. It has become one of her very favorite toys, and I recommend it to anyone who has a kid who loves music."
4,Fun and entertaining,"My daughter enjoys playing with this toy. She laughs every time she sees herself in the mirror and she loves banging on the buttons, which are super-big. The buttons cause little people to pop up, and she loves trying to catch them before they fall. Also, the wide spread of the toy's legs make it sturdy enough that she can pull herself up without making me afraid that it will fall over on her. The music is a bit cheesy, and the microphone doesn't seem to have a purpose (it's more like a rattle), but overall it's an enjoyable toy."
5,Love it!,"Love this toy and so do both of my kids (boy 2 yrs & girl 7 months). My daugther likes to push the buttons to make music and is fascinated by the lights (and her image in the mirror) while my son loves to dance to the music. We have some good times with this toy (even if only for 10 minutes at a time ;) ) Compared to many other musical toys, this one has really fun tunes even for mom & dad, some of them are jazzy renditions. Five stars for being ""whole family"" friendly."
4,Good toy...,"It's a great little toy..lots of action, color and music. Grand baby loved it. She is just turning one next month."
4,Great Toy For Independent Sitters,My 9 month old daughter loves this toy. She talks to herself in the mirror and loves the microphone and all of the buttons and music. It is very upbeat and one of the better toys I have purchased for her.Their are 2 downsides. One is that if the baby pulls on it it can tip over. The second is that the music plays continually and does not go off on it's own when it is not in use.Other then that I would never trade this toy in. She adores it.
4,A crowd pleaser!,"I read all reviews before purchasing and decided to get it since it was on sale for a cheap price! I bought it for my 6 month old baby girl but my 2 year old LOVED it! He took over Christmas Day and just played the heck out of it. He was giggling and dancing up a storm! I think he enjoyed watching himself dance and laugh in the mirror which caused even more giggling! I think everyone should ignore the negative ratings on this toy because to me, it was worth the 17 bucks with the amazon no hassle packaging!"
3,It is OKAY.. VERY SMALL!!,"I was very surprised on how small this was! It says up to 4 years old! I purchased this for my 15 month old, who LOVES music and mirros, however this only held his attention for a few minutes before he threw the microphone- WHICH DOES NOTHING (IT IS A RATTLE- Plastic with beads that shake) down on the floor and walked away. It does not stop making noise until you shut it off yourself either, which would be good, if he enjoyed it. My 5 year old has NO interest in it at all. I paid $30 for it, would not recommend it."
2,Used Toy!?!?!,I ordered this toy for my 6 month old daughters (twins) expecting it to be new.I got a VERY used toy! There is build up in the crack and scratched mirror and everything! Very gross!I called Amazon and they are sending out a new (hopefully) toy. Doesnt look like this has happened to anyone before so maybe it was just a fluke?I would beware before sending this to a loved one!
2,Not worth the money!,"My baby got 2 of these for christmas and at first I thought, we'll just keep them both and put them on different floors in the house, but when I put one together and saw that all it does really is play a little music and has very little activity options for baby, I really don't know what to do with the other one. Definately not worth fifty bucks!!!!"
4,entertaining,"My 7 month old hasn't figured out how everything works, but she gets so excited when I sit her in front of it. She loves the music and playing with the microphone."
3,It is ok,"There are two selections. One is for songs. The songs are very good. My one-year-old daughter loves them. However, another selection...I guess it is suppose to let the baby to dance with the music... but is it English? Is that a real musics? Or maybe it is just a girl who says something which I cannot understand. Very disappointed about that. Anyway, the songs are very good. And she loves the mirror."
1,Missing several parts! = FRUSTRATION,"I'm not sure if this is a function of this new ""Frustration Free"" packaging that Amazon is offering, but the Singalong Stage arrived in a generic cardboard box with NO INSTRUCTIONS and missing the screws, 3 AAA batteries, lyrics cards and microphone holder. The irony being, I am now VERY FRUSTRATED!!!! Because obviously, if they had kept the item in the original packaging, unopened, I probably would've gotten all the parts. I immediately called Amazon customer service, and while I'm glad they were answering calls at 9:05 pm CST, my frustration was increased by the fact the customer service rep had a very thick accent (if you want to be offended by that, feel free) and I had to ask him to repeat himself over and over again so I could understand what he was trying to say. I don't have time for that kind of nonsense. Amazon, you might want to rethink this ""Frustration Free"" concept!!!"
3,"too short for toddler, but good music","probably really good for infants and not toddlers. my child got bored with it in a day or so. she is 11 months and has to bend her knees to look in the mirror. once in a while she'll go back and play with it. but i like having it around. we also bought a activity table which gets more use. you should invest your money in a table instead. although, the sound stage does have cute music."
5,Her favorite toy,"I bought this for my 7 month old, and although at first it scared her, it has become her favorite toy (she's now 10 months). She especially loves that she can use it to stand and play. It has kept her attention for much longer than most other toys."
3,Baby Loves It,"I bought this toy when my daughter was ten months. Because she loves music and looking at herself I thought she would enjoy it. I tried to save it until Christmas but I couldn't wait to see her play with it. Just as I thought, she loved it.CONSNot stable enough for a child to lean on and a bit pricey.PROSThe toy sings five songs: If Your Happy and You Know It, Wiggle, Head Shoulder Knees and Toes, Peek a Boo, and What Do You See When You Look In The Mirror. A couple of the songs have both the lyrical version and instrumental so that my baby may have her time in the spotlight singing her solo.My daughter is now 14 months and still having fun with this toy."
5,Great buy!,This toy is fantastic! Our daughter is 10 months old and she loves it! There are five songs and they're a little jazzy with real voices singing. The musical instruments are great too. The height is perfect because she can sit in front of it or pull herself up to stand and play.
5,7 Month Old Loves it!,"My daughter really enjoys this toy. The mirror and lights are a huge hit. The only problem we've run into is that my daughter likes to pull herself up and stand, this toy doesn't have enough back weight for her to do so which has resulted in her falling down with it landing on top of her. With supervision this is a great toy, overall I'm very happy with it. Quick delivery too!"
5,Awesome!,"I got this for Christmas for my 6mo son. He loves it!! He's just starting to sit up by himself and this has given him lots of practice. He could sit at this thing for hours hitting the keys and laughing in the mirror. The songs are VERY cute. Not annoying like some toys, I have fun singing them to him. The sons also make it fun for you to play with your little one while singing along. My older daughter loves to use this toy with my son as well, she gets a kick out of the songs and dances around him while using body movements or facial expressions to demonstrate the words sung. It's so cute."
5,Never before have I been so pleased!,"My daughter is now 18 months old and we have had this toy since her 1st birthday, she has Down Syndrome and was not very conversive untill we got this toy!! It turns out she is the most interesting person she knows and will just go to town talking to herself every day even after having it so long!! This toy has far out ranked anything else I have bought through out my three children's lives!"
5,1 yr old loves!!,my daughter got this for christmas she was 12 months.. she loves it.. she is now 15 months and still plays it.. it was her favorite christmas gift. IT IS GREAT!! her favorite thing to do with it is climb it.. lol. so it is built very well and she love to push the buttons and dance.
4,Fun for the indpendent sitter,At 6 months our son is more active with this toy than he was at 5 months. we can sit him in front of this and he will bang away on all the buttons (for a good 15 - 30 minutes without crying for mom/dad/boredom). we like the mode where the more noise you make the more the lights flash vs the 4 or 5 songs that play continuously. my nieces that are 3 and 4 like to play with it also. i'd the say the value of the entertainment for the price is well worth it. the only downside is that the legs don't fold up so it does take up room. we have it tucked in a corner of the living room so we don't trip over it. and sometimes we'll catch our schnauzer going up to it and looking in the mirror.
5,A fun toy!,My 7 month Granddaughter loves to sit and look at herself in the mirror.She is learning how to push the buttons to make sounds.My 2 year-old grandson likes playing with her and is learning to sing along with the songs.They both spend a lot of time with this toy and have fun playing together with it.
2,This is not a $50- toy,"This toy is cute but it is basically a glorified mirror with a few lights and buttons that play music. That is all.Now, my nine month old gives it a few courtesy laughs but then she just wants to use it as an item to cruise from, however, the rear legs do not stay on (even though I have applied them correctly) and this poses a great problem for which I will call FP.If you want a great toy, invest in an exersaucerEvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer! I firmly believe that this toy assisted in the muscle development which allowed each of my children to walk independantly by 10 months of age."
4,Fisher Price little superstar sing-along stage,"Nice toy, keeps baby busy for little while. Perfect for 10-24months old babes. In this age they loves mirrors, sounds and lights. Toy is good but not brilliant, it could have more options/buttons. Generally I'm happy with this purchase."
3,Just an okay toy,This toy is great but my 11 month old doesn't enjoy playing with it too much. He'll play with it for a minute or so and then want to move onto something else. I think he would have enjoyed it better when he was younger. I wish I would have purchased it when he was around 6 months rather than 10 months. But it is a cute toy.
4,Cute toy,"My daughter is 7 months old and I think she enjoys the ""microphone"" with this toy more than the toy itself. She does like the lights and music but it doesn't entertain her for long right now. I am hoping as she gets a bit older, she will take more interest in this item considering its price. I might recommend this item for a child that is about 9 months old or older. My nieces that are 2 and 4 seem to like it too."
3,good toy bad design,"18 lb, 7 month old loves the toy, but when she pulled back on it the first time, it fell on her. Poor design should have longer front legs to prevent it from tipping towards the baby. We'll just watch her more carefully now when she plays with it, but I believe the tipping problem could be avoided by the manufacturer's design. Other than that, she is in awe when playing with it."
5,Loads of Giggles,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5-month old nephew, and he just loves it! He loves looking at himself and pushing all of the buttons. The toy has some great catchy music and very flashy colors and toys to play with. He can sit there for a while and be very content. A great buy!"
4,Fun toy for little ones,"This is a fun toy that my 3 month old already enjoys looking at. Its nice that it sings actual songs (such as Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes) that you can sing along to. The microphone is a waste but is a fun rattle I guess. My friends daughter still plays with it on occasion and shes 18 months old."
5,a lot of fun.,We bought this for our 7 month old but our 3 year old plays with it more. Good for a baby that syllable sits and soon to stand.
5,Fun,This items is better for older children around 2 years old. My newborn is not ready to play it yet.
4,Fun,My daughter just turned 13 months and enjoys this toy. She loves the songs it plays. The only downfall is that the songs will seem to play on their own when we walk by or something. She does love to laugh at herself in the mirror and thinks it's fun to make faces together. I'd say it is a pretty good toy overall.
4,Little Superstar Sing Along,"My 7 month old loves to sit and/or stand and play with this toy. She loves to play with the various musical insturments to make it work. It did not take long for her to figure out how to use all of the instruments. She also loves that she can see herself and others in the mirror. The microphone is like a rattle so she is always reaching for it to make even more noise. She is still a little wobbly when standing, but she is able to hold on to the toy when standing with very little assistance. It has a wide base so it is harder to tip over. There aere 2 volume settings and 2 play settings. One setting is a sing along/karaoke, the other makes various music as you touch the instruments and plays different songs randomly."
2,stopped working after two months,"My daughter received it as a gift when she was 9 mos old; she played with it for 2 mos and loved it, but then it inexplicably ""died"". Yes, we tried replacing batteries, but that doesn't help. If Fisher Price had a customer service department that was even REMOTELY helpful or user-friendly, I might have given this a better rating because she did enjoy it when it actually worked."
5,A real hit with our baby!,We got this for our daughter for Christmas when she was 11 months. At 15 months she still plays with it daily. She loves looking at herself in the mirror and hitting the different buttons to see how the music changes. She's small for her age so she can pull up on the stage without it falling over on her but I can see how it could topple with a bigger baby. Originally I had the stage on my wish list until Amazon emailed me to let me know there had been a 50% price drop. Needless to say we ordered it immediately and were able to get it for $25. It's worth $50 but it sure was nice to pay half that!
5,One of my Daughter's favorites,We bought this four our daughter when she was 7-8 months old. It is the perfect height for her to play she loves playing with it and banging toys on it. The only bad thing is she is starting to pull to stand and it is not very sturdy for that she pulled it over on top of her. She seems to enjoy the instrument only feature over the singing feature and she loves when Daddy or Mommy is on the floor singing along with it for her.
2,"It's o.k., but there are better, more balanced views.","I read the books by Win Worley back in the early 80's. Much is true but the author takes truth way out on the end of the branch and then falls off. Pigs in the Parlor by Frank and Ida M. Hammond is a much better book to read to understand casting out of demons. A very balanced, uplifting text. It exalts the Lord. Another text is Out in the Name of Jesus."
4,"A very sweet and cute Zapf doll ,but........","My mom bought this doll to give my daughter this coming Christmas(she already has and LOVES her little Be Happy Chou Chou).I decided to test out the doll befor wrapping and putting it up till the big day.First of all I have to say the doll is just so cute and really does look and feel like a little baby,but then I put in the batteries.The sounds just aren't as nice as the Be Happy doll.The cooing crying and giggling souds are alright, but the yawning,sucking,and breathing sounds are just off putting.The yawning sounds like a metallic box closing , the sucking sounds are just odd(I have nothing to compare it to)and the breathing sound is just plain weird.You also have to rock this doll for quite a while before the eyes close.That being said I still plan on giving her the doll,but without batteries for now."
2,needs more,"(...) I'm sure there are some who will enjoy her as an educational experience;You must use a gentle touch to soothe her, but that is the only educational aspect."
1,"Beware, this is the study guide, not the book",The title and description leads you to believe this is the actual book. It is not it is only the study guide of questions.

4,Very Good,"I thought that was a box set, but in truly are jewlcases separated with both shows. No problems ! The sound is great. Although the booklet is poor, no have pictures, just one in every album. But it's a collector item !. Thank you."
2,Ritchie Phones It In,"These shows, recorded on the last tour Ritchie Blackmore did before leaving Deep Purple, are a testament to just how uninterested Richie was in participating in the band. As in most shows from this tour, The Man In Black could barely be bothered to play most of ""Highway Star."" This CD collection is for die-hard Purple fans only. The highlight of the collection is the short preview of ""Hall of the Mountain King"" Ritchie plays. This song will end up on the Rainbow album, ""Stranger In Us All."" For all sane Purple fans, ""Come Hell or High Water"" is the definitive live CD from this tour."
2,Just a huge printed checklist?,If you need a huge checklist and nothing else then this is the book for you. You won't really learn anything from this book and I guess that's not its intent.This is just a huge checklist that you get two copies of. What do I do when I need a third copy? It would be much better if I had an electronic copy of this rather than a book version. If you make copies they will look like crap and you may be breaking the law...wtf?Just make sure you know what your buying. I didn't.
1,"EXTREMELY basic, and not in a good sense","Aspiring home inspectors, look elsewhere. This book is exactly what it is listed as, a CHECKLIST. Don't expect to actually learn anything about the systems that make up a home. Maybe a decent buy for a homeowner's personal use, but definitely not for a pro or for a pre-purchase inspection. Hire a licensed professional when it counts. For something a little more in depth, I'd recommend Rex Cauldwell's Inspecting a House."
5,A VERY HEART RENCHING BOOK,"I first read this book when I was still in high school (1985). This book is unlike any of Barbara Cartland's other books. As a matter of fact, this was the first book that did not mimic her other books.Anyone who has ever read any of Ms. Cartland's books know that eventually all of her books wind up basically being the same. The plot is the same, the woman is the same, the hero is the same and so on. They eventually become monotonous. But this book had me in tears. The things that the heroine goes through is enough to make any mortal think of suicide.This book will not disappoint the reader, if it does, well then the reader probably didn't understand it all that well. I plan on buying this book once again (since my copy is missing) and read it once more (and have a good cry)."
3,Ups and Downs,"This was given to my daughter when she was born so we couldn't really use it much till she became a few months older. as far as this toy goes for an infant who lays on their back its pretty boring. the only thing to touch are the links that hang down and for the bear to sing and light up the baby can't control when they want it to do so by hitting or kicking something, you either need to push its nose(which may be to high for them to reach, as with my daughter) or you need to move the yellow arm that hangs foward, not backward which you'd expect since when a baby kicks it would cause something to go back, so when baby kicks it, nothing happens.now that she can sit up(in her bumbo chair) she enjoys it a lot more. she can grab the links and play with the devices on the bears hands, rolls the balls own the sides, but thats really about it. i think that your $40 could go towards something a lot more fun and beneficial. looks cute and all, but its really pretty lame."
4,Great entertainment!,"My three-month-old son loves this toy! He kicks and kicks and loves the lights and sounds. He is starting to grab onto the toys on the sides, and absolutely wears himself out playing with it. Great for active babies!"
3,Good but not a must have,"My son was four months when he received this. He didn't really get that interested in it until later when he started crawling, sitting and standing. The shape made it impractical to put my baby under when he could roll because he would end up up either getting stuck or whacking himself on the hard plastic supports. All he liked to do with it before he was more mobile was pull the bumble bees off, which didn't occupy him for more than a minute or two. Around 7 months he had a lot of fun learning to pull himslef up on the bear head and now likes stand or kneel by it and get the music to play. The clicky blue circle thing over the left bee is useless but he does like the blue and yellow rolly ball on the right. This isn't a bad toy but it's not the best use of $40, either. We could certainly live without it."
4,good toy,"Okay, first of all, this toy retails for $35 at Babies R Us. Don't you dare spend a dollar more! The toy is great. Both my 5 month old and my almost two year old enjoy it. Fun sounds, neat things to grab, etc. But the price ($145!!!) is insane! What in the world is this company thinking...if you can't find it for the retail price, skip it and buy something else. Fab toy for the right price."
5,Bored easily son loves it!,"My 3 month old son gets bored very easily. We have been using this gym for awhile now & he loves it! He was also having problems with gas/colic and the crazy kicking he does has really helped with that as well! It has a high & low volume setting, which is nice for me, and has a flashing nose and colorful attachments which my son really likes. He is learning cause & effect very quickly with this toy, as he has already figured outthat kicking will turn it back on if you are not using the continous play feature. The continuous play feature does shut off after awhile, and if your baby isnt strong enough to kick it, you just push the bears head down to restart it. This was probably the best thing we have bought for him so far!"
1,Count the larger pieces in the front!,"The few large pieces shown in the photo are the only pieces of that size you will get. The rest are little better than strings, useless as chew toys as well as too small or too short for most toy making."
4,Some of Claremont's best work,"If you already own the original issues from Giant Sized X-Men to X-Men 137 or Essential X-Men Vol. 2, or some other TPB then this collection of stories from Classic X-Men is perfect for you. These collections of vignettes reveal much of the characterizations not revealed in the original issues and provide some key moments in the history of certain characters (especially the Magneto stories).Otherwise, I suggest trying to collect the original Classic X-Men comic books. If the condition of the comic book doesn't matter to you, and you only care about the stories, you could probably find all the Classic X-Men comics for under a dollar each. It's probably cheaper to do that than to buy all the trade paperbacks, plus I always preferred handling a comic book, than a TPB."
4,This version of Medea is great,"I have used this play in my IB English World Literature HL class and in my IB Theatre Arts HL class. I haven't used any other edition or version, but this one is great."
5,Amazing,"The book was in excellent condition and it was a joy to read! It was a quick and easy read. If you enjoy scandal, murder, and women overpowering men, then this is the book for you!"
3,"It used to go like that, now it goes like this","Actually, Fahey recorded this one himself right there in the motel where he was living at the time; he got a little help with the tape loops (not from Jim O'Rourke) but that's about all. So it's just exactly as he intended. Which means it's difficult stuff, mainly, because this is the New Fahey - no more Mr Nice Guy, no more Blues or Folk or whatever it was - now you get Industrial Ambient. Hmmm. I do enjoy the idea of Fahey tearing up his whole back catalogue, trashing all his old fans and heading out into... Somewhere Else. (Starting with ""City of Refuge"" and continuing with ""The Epiphany of Glenn Jones"") But I probably like the idea better than I like this cd. On the other hand, Gamelan found sounds are nothing new. Check out Fahey's 1968 composition ""A Raga Called Pat"" (on ""The Voice of the Turtle"")."
4,Womb-like,"Ok this one is dense, but I don't think it should be compared with Mr. Fahey's early works, this stage of his work is part of a very complex evolution. You have to simply let yourself go, like you did'nt knew a thing, like being, really, in a womb."
2,There Are Much Better Fahey CDs,"There are a few moments of brilliance on this disc, but for the most part they are literally drowned out by Jim O'Rourke's heavy handed production. This CD is a mess of droning atonal slide guitar, feedback, and various other industrial noises. In fact, it sounds not unlike O'Rourke's own Terminal Pharmacy with hotter mastering and glimpses of real musical brilliance.This was the first John Fahey CD I bought, and I'm very thankful that I was not discouraged enough to refrain from purchasing a few more. His earlier work is brilliant. Fahey's music, like that of any talented musician is ultimately more interesting unadorned."
1,if you're not in john fahey's (or J. O'Rourke's) womb..,"This is really unlistenable except for ""juana"" the rest sounds like he's fretting with an eel (or various other fish) or even someone else's hands, underwater in a bathtub listening to harry partch whilst being recorded by an amateur with a very cheap tape recorder. Shame I like new music but this ain't new. Listen to the classic J.F.'s and avoid this one like the great white shark! I'm glad I didn't start with this one."
5,Always 5 stars,I've never purchased any Melissa and Doug toys that I didn't love and I'm sure this puzzle will be the same. My 4 yr old is zooming thru the 50-60 pc ones so bought him this one for Christmas.
3,Educational for lower elem. kids,I enjoyed assembling this puzzle with my six year old. She is learning about the solar system with me. We have never been disappointed in Melissa and Doug products.
2,Nothing Special - Realy,"The only reason you buy this stand is to use it with the D24000 saw. It is nothing special. The adjustable legs are tightened with the screw so you adjust it once and forget it. Dear DeWalt, for $100 stand if not including wheels, at least include some hard plastic shoes on the bottom of the legs so you can slide it if needed.The saw itself though is great!"
4,Works great,Works great. I got a set of casters for it now it works even better. Price it out you can get it with the purchase of a saw.
3,Very helpfull,"I purchased this along with the Dewalt Saw. It really should have come packaged with the saw! It is a good stand, can't imagine using the saw without it.Giving three stars because for this price it should include the saw."
3,Not What's in the Picture,"I ordered this and received it promptly; however, what I received is not what is pictured. I received the AVF-750, not the AVF-750S. Mine has a single arm that does NOT bend in the middle like the one that is pictured."
1,A stinker with no character or invention,"Robbie Williams isn't a serious musician; he's a pop star. He has his records co-written and puts most of his emphasis onto the stage show and videos, creating his gigantic ego. When he gets gorgeous songs liek Angels and She's teh One, the results are stunning; semi-rockers like It's Only Us and Old Before I Die can be equally impressive. When he comes up with Rock DJ, with it's novelty rap an risque lyrics, it can be sen as good entertainment. But this lazy rewrite of I Will Survive, complete with more cod-rapping, is not what a top pop star should be producing. Robbie is basically a heterosexual, modern Elton John-obsessed with his image and flamboyance, and occasionally able to come up with a good tune to back up his writing partner's lyrics. But this is style over substance in the worst possible way."
5,Prepare your kids for a new sibling with this doll!,"I have two girls, ages almost 4 and 2. While the older one has been begging for another sibling, the 2 yr old has shown no interest...until the Chou Chou doll came along. At first, the crying seemed to make her distraught, but when she found out how much fun it was to take care of her ""own baby"" and be able to stop it's crying, rock her to sleep, and make it coo, she was sold. If she can't stop the crying, she seeks out her sister and it's a joint effort that they just love! It's been a nice trial for the time, when and if, a new sibling does come into the house!"
5,Great for all little girls from 3 to 69,"I purchased 2 chou chou babies for my 3 and 5 year old grandaughters and had my 9 year old help me wrap them. Naturally we had to take it out of the package, insert batteries, and try it out. It would be great to show little girls what it's like to take care of a real baby especially when it cries. Margaret W"
5,Great for 3 and up,Bought this doll for my grand-daughter (age 3).... she loves it. Quite realistic. Doubt you will be sorry.
5,Chou Chou Charmed My Daughter,"Rock-a-bye Chou Chou is a wonderful toy for any child. She stops crying when you pat her back and begins to coo. She teaches and reinforces nurturing skills. My daughter received her as a Christmas gift and has played with her constantly. It is great that she has so many adorable clothes available. I would like to foster this wholesome, caregiving kind of play for a long as possible."
2,Scary little baby,"I just bought this doll for my three year old granddaughter. I have not given it to her yet. I installed the batteries, and the baby is really a disappointment. She laughs briefly, then launches into a ""sighing"" that sounds more like a moan. It is actually pretty scary. Poor baby, does she have a tummy ache? Appendicitis? Asthma? Is she dying? Is she depressed? The baby either moans or cries. The giggling and cooing is very short in comparison. Pictures show her with a pacifier in her mouth, but when I put the pacifier in her mouth it just falls out. The pacifier (and bottle) must be pushed into her mouth and held there for her to suck. The slightest letup in pressure sends her back to moaning (or crying) again. Maybe the doll is defective? Maybe there is prozac for baby dolls. She is a very cute little baby, and I do not plan to return her, but I fear my granddaughter might prefer playing with her with the sound off!"
3,Don't blame Artist Pictures,"In responce to the review that said customer pictures were not of a Rock-a-Bye Chou Chou, you are right and wrong.A lot of doll artists do what is called ""reborning"". This is where you take a factory doll such as Chou Chou, or more commonly Berenger, and redo it. Usually they strip and redo all paint, change out the body, root new hair, change eyes, etc.It IS a Chou Chou still, just a much more realistic version.If you look at the pictures they will almost always have the artist's name and a link to their website.I'm impressed that someone could make a Chou Chou look that good."
5,"I haven,t tried batteries yet","Hi, I am the one who wrote in Rock A Bye Chou Chou wouldn,t work after coming back from eating. Actually I haven,t tried batteries yet. So I,ll try batteries ."
2,not so impressed,My 4year old daughter recieved this for her birthday. I have to say it's cute..it feels like a *real* baby but it can be terribly annoying...and the sounds it makes sound nothing like a real baby. My daughter gets really frusterated with it and ends up turning off the sounds.If it sounded like a real Baby it would be much betteer.
5,Mommy why won't it stop crying?,"My daughter received this doll about 6 months ago. She was 3 1/2 at the time. She loves this doll. I can remember her saying ""Mommy why won't she stop crying?"". It was so funny to hear that. Once the doll had gone to sleep she woke the doll up by playing again and the doll cried. She didn't know yet to comfort the baby doll by patting her back. It is very realistic when eating and makes little ahh ahhh deep breathing noises when falling asleep. Once asleep the eyes close. I think it is a fantastic way for young children to learn about real babies. A+ Zafp creations"
3,Daughter loved it for a while.......,I bought this doll my 3 year old daughter for christmas. She loved it for a while but she got to heavy to carry around. She prefered her little babies to take with her. The doll is life like ( heavy) but once I put the batteries in her she wouldnt stop crying! Needless to say the batteries only lasted 20 minutes and never went back in. Now her baby is laying in a toy box and she plays with her small babies that she can take every where.
2,Not that Great,"My 4 year old never plays with this doll. It's not that much fun. It should do more. All it does is cry (which it hardly ever does), laugh, make snoring sounds, and yawn. It's a cute doll but boring."
2,Not happy at all,The description of doll was way off. It does not do any of it...All it does is moan loudly...my daughter is very dissapointed
5,My doll by Hannah Jefferson,"my mummy got me this doll for my birthday. she is really cute, and i play with her all the time. i like what she is wearing. i like that she cries. i look after her well"
3,Four year old frustrated!,"This is a wonderful doll! She is so cute! But our little girl just became so frustrated that she couldn't make the dolly laugh or sleep when she wanted to. This surprised me as I thought she would love it. She is so good with real babies. As a result she wasn't played with much, and she would often ask me to turn chou chou off when her eyes closed in ""sleep"". If chou chou woke up she would be frustrated if she couldn't keep her quiet. I would definately try this doll with an older child 6 or up. But for younger children Chou Chou also has a simple 19 inch doll that won't limit your childs immagination."
5,After a Year It's Still a Favorite...,I bought this doll for my daughter's 2nd birthday...a year later it's still her favorite. Being so life like it also makes it educational. I love all of the accessories that you are able to buy...it makes the fun keep growing rather than growing old. And great for parents (especially fathers) there is an on/off switch in the back. My daughter has even declared Chou Chou a member of the family giving her our last name too.
1,Bummer..........,This doll (to me)doesn't look real and it is stuffed to almost the ankles and Wrist and I did ssssoooo many chores and I wasn't satisfiedso I am bring it back.
5,Great Doll.....,I just bought two of these dolls one for my 9 year old niece (who saw it on tv) and one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter (who wants it because of her cousin talking about it) ....They were shipped to my job so me and a few co-workers opened one of them to see how it works. It was pretty fun I think they will enjoy it and the best thing of all is that you can turn them off whenever it gets on your nerves....that is a plus in my household. If you want to buy your child a really nice doll choose this one....Oh yeah it was also on sale at another store....so check around.
4,annoying cry!!!,"baby chou chou is a cute baby doll but the cry is soooo annoying. She is supposed to stop after you put the pacifier or bottle into her mouth, but she keeps on for what seems like forever.We ended up turning her off..Occasionally my 3 year old will turn her back on and I am reminded of why I turned her off in the first place. This year we will try Baby Annabell.."
2,malfunctioned Rock A Bye Chou Chou Doll,My 2 year old daughter got a rock a bye baby for christmas in 2004. She played with it for only 2 hours and as everyone else had reported her eyes kept opening and shutting and she would not do anything else. I would not recommend this doll to anyone it was a waste of my mom and dads money an i just want to let the makers of this toy to know that i am very unsatisfied.
2,Shaken baby syndrome,"It's a very cute doll, but in order to get it to stop yawning and go to sleep, I had to shake the doll rather hard back and forth while it's lying down. Otherwise, it will keep yawning and sighing for a good couple of minutes which is maddening. Other than that, it's a pretty good toy, but I can see little kids getting really frustrated when they want to gently rock their ""baby"" to sleep and can't do it. Also, the cry is surprisingly realistic which I liked a lot and it sounded really sweet when it did fall asleep and was breathing."
5,Great first doll for my daughter,"I know that my daughter was a little young for this doll at age two, however, I did not want to dish out a bunch of money for a doll that did much less then this one. I just took away the small accessories that came with it, and gave her the doll last Christmas. It was a well received gift. She carried it around forever. Since Christmas this doll gets quite a bit of use. Personally, I think this doll is very realistic. My daughter calls the baby Alex, which is her baby brother's name, so she must think the doll looks real, too. It is really cute to watch her imitate me taking care of my little one with this doll. You won't be sorry. Great purchase...."
5,SERIOUSLY ADORABLE!,"Baby Chou Chou is so much fun that you will wonder who the doll is for, the adult or the child! She laughs and crys and eats and sleeps and is very pretty. She is the second most popular doll from this line, taking second place to Annabell. However, she does so many more things than Annabell, who spends most of her time crying. If you want a happy baby doll, choose Baby Chou Chou!"
5,Great Realistic Baby,"My Daughter is 3 and for her birthday we decided to get this doll. What a great toy. Although it talks, it is not loud. It cries, coos, pretends to suck on a bottle and pacifier, yawns breathes like it is sleeping and closes its eyes when it goes to sleep. We have another daughter that is 5 months and now all our 3 year old does is play mommy. The baby even had to go to day care because baby's can not stay home by themselves! She buckles it in, in the car and everything. The kids at the day care and the adults loved it so much they got one. I think this doll is not only cute but a good doll for older siblings to understand a new baby in the house. I can not say enough good about it. It is definitely a keeper!"
5,My daughter and nieces love this doll!!!,"My mother-in-law bought this doll for my daughter and two of her girl cousins almost two years ago. They have been loved every day of the year. They are very durable and easy to clean except for the cloth body. If they go around naked for very much, the body gets soiled and is hard to clean. My daughter is a neat-nik so her baby is never without clothes and she is still fairly clean. These dolls wear real baby clothes so they are cheap and easy to find at a local thrift store or yard sale."
3,Strange bodyshape - you can only buy Chou Chou accessories,"I bought this toy for my daughter for x-mas. It is cute, sucks, makes cute sounds etc. It is kind of heavy though. The whole body looks very awkward with the legs kind of dangling and a very big belly. I didn't want to spend the money on the Chou Chou outfits and bought other outfits that are supposed to fit that doll, well due to her misshaped body none of the regular doll diapers fit and none of the regular doll clothes. So, be aware when you buy this doll that you WILL have to buy CHOU CHOU accessories which are just as pricey as the doll itself. So Mattel made that doll that way so you don't have a choice but spend more and more money."
2,My daughter prefers her other dolls!,"The first thing my 3 1/2 year old said was, ""it's too heavy"". It got her attention when it started babbling, but as soon as you lay it back, it starts to yawn or sigh--and does it over and over again. She actually said, ""it's driving me crazy!"" and ""send it back"". My 19 month old son likes feeding it the bottle. He kept playing with it, while my daughter played with his ""Bob the Builder"" doll."
2,Disappointment,"We bought this doll for our 3 year olds birthday. She was so excited and loved it. The doll did everything it was supposed to do, sounded real, and was so cute. We gave the doll to her around 2 p.m. and by 5 p.m. all she did was make a sucking noise. We took her back and bought Baby Annebell and are so delighted. She is a much happier baby and is actually eaiser to take care of. Baby Chou Chou took a few tries before you actually got it to work. We are very pleased with Baby Annebell. I read all of the reviews prior to our purchases, but I couldn't get Annabell in the store, I could only get her online so we went with Chou Chou to save time. We ended up just having to wait for Annabell to arrive, but it was well worth the wait!!"
3,Died too soon,"I was very unhappy with the quality of this doll.The enterainment value is very limited because it only does the same 3 things over and over. Not to mention the fact that it ran out of batteries very quickly.My 5 yo daughter is very easy with her toys and this doll malfunctioned after only 6 months of use.If wanted to send [money] on a doll, it would not be on this doll or any from this company."
4,Rock A Bye Chou Chou Doll,My 2 and a half year old daughted got this from Santa. She was both surprised and amazed how the doll made real baby sounds. She Loves it and treats it like a real baby.
1,Perverted band that doesn't deserve your money or attention,"I would give this 'zero' stars, but that option is not available. I'm sure that finger nails running down a chalk board would sound better than anything by this ""band.""The lead singer has sodomized a skinned calf on stage and has placed rats in a blender and had the audience drink it. He has photos of this at his website. This is beyond demented and sick; it is certainly not ""art.""Hopefully the humane society will get involved to stop the animal abuse which is carried on by the band members.Unforunately we are now living in a society where morality is decaying and where doing perverted things on stage covers for lack of talent. Don't give these untalented, disgusting perverts your money and don't see them perform live. Gets a grade of F"
1,Poser-rock for posers!,"The music is a combination of many styles, yet the talent that is lacking from the members makes this ""music"" sound like recycled garbage from yesterday. To make up for this, they result to performing shocking live shows only to prove that not only are they not capable of making music, but that they also have no lives. Really, these guys don't scare nor shock anyone, but this is one group the Slipknot and Marilyn Manson kids will just eat up because they'll think it's the latest trend. They say nothing, they prove nothing, they are nothing."
1,Waste of time,"Trying so hard to be something, and failing miserably. The music's not good enough, so they have to rely on moronic performances to elicit attention.Bad bad bad."
5,Much faster than Disturbingly sassy..,"This CD was much faster than the newer CD. The tracks are mixed pretty well and the song ""Ripping the Wings From the Backs of Angels"" is the most aggressive and catchy tune I have ever heard. That song has been playing in my mind all day long and I am still not tired of it. I hope this band is working on a third CD because they are one of my favorite bands in less than a week of listening to their first two cd's. GO Hell on Earth !!"
5,Raindrop Serenade,"Track Listings:1. Raindrop Prelude2. Für Elise3. Clair de Lune4. Sonata in C-Rondo5. Pathetique Sonata6. Gymnopodie No. 37. Sonata in A-Variations8. Waltz in a Flat9.

Traumerei[Disclaimer: The track list for this album is provided as a courtesy, because at the time of this listing, there were no song titles available on this page, for this title. We feel that you should be aware of what songs are on this album before making your purchase. Enjoy!]"
5,Love This Album,"The album is great. Jean has a great voice and the songs have a good rythm. He wants to makes his own music, because since he is Luis Fonsi's brother, he wants to make his own name on the music industry. He is doing really well, and he is also a great guy...so buy the cd."
2,"Spare, spares and all spares.","The fun factor is through the roof, but why have I played the game almost 20 times and only gotten one strike? I get spares all the time. It's fun, sure, but if you take bowling seriously you'll be frustrated by this poor bowling experience approximation. Seems like someone at Atari could have benefitted from a high school physics class."
4,hard to find classic,"this cd is not as tight and powerful as brightside but many years past between then but still a great cd.killing time/(raw deal) never got the dues back in the day but the whole new york hard core scence gave them alot of respect.they crossed over many nusical realms but did metalic hard core proudly.fans of old prong.sick of it all ,judge,cromags,warzone & madball will definetly like this band."
4,"More DRAGON TALES from the creators of ""Sesame Street""","More DRAGON TALES from the creators of ""Sesame Street"". In this story, Zak & Wheezie help Emmy build her dream house. Consistent with the rest of the series, imagination is the key in helping children learn lessons. Sweetly done and a very good edition for your one-four year olds.Note: if you like this series, keep an eye for DVD releases of Dragon Tales, complete with sing-a-longs."
2,No calibration ability?,"Purchased this unit from Amazon and thought that all these units were able to be calibrated. So I purchased a one-step calibration Humidipak. After placing the unit in the pack for 24 hours, the reading was off by +3%. Went to the PlanetWaves website searching the instructions and their site on how to calibrate - nothing. Apparently there is no way to calibrate it and there is nowhere in the limited instructions, where it states it is not able to be calibrated.Oh well, I should of read the reviews further. For now I'll just subtract 3% from whatever the reading is. Otherwise the unit does what it says it does."
3,No Calibration,"I just bought it yesterday from Guitar Center. I bought it because they only sold this one, so I gave it a try. So far it function as it suppose to. I used it against a cheap analog hygrometer and I assume that it reads a lot more accurate than the analog one. The downside is that it cannot be calibrate. I could not find anywhere in the manual that says it can (I asked the guys in GC, and they had no idea what I was talking about). So you will need a lot of faith to believe that it is accurate enough, unless you have another one (or 2) to compare against it. And I hate to spend another 20 bucks for another hygrometer just to compare with it.Overall, this hygrometer works fine. It looks sharp and fits perfectly in my guitar case. I'll have to see more in the future if there will be any issue with it. No calibration, so you can't do any salt test. Next time if I buy another hygrometer, I'll definitely choose the one that can be calibrated."
1,sensor not accurate,"I have two same Planet Waves humidity sensors. Don't trust any of them as putting both side by side I have completely different readings of humidity (like 34% versus 25%). Sometimes units having less difference in readings, but had never been less than 3%. This is crap unit with no stability and accuracy."
2,Questionable accuracy,"I purchased two of the hygrometers to protect my Martins and found that when tested with the salt and water method, both units were off by 5 to 8%. Not a problem except that they cannot be calibrated; a cheaper unit purchased from a cigar store offers calibration and better accuracy. Pass on this hygrometer"
1,Didn't Work,"Upon opening the package, and activating the battery by pulling the plastic shipping tab, the unit did not work. I found that gently shaking the unit would give me intermittent readings. I removed the battery compartment cover, and found that the electric leads would only make contact with the battery if the battery was held precisely in place (against a small spring). The battery cover did not hold the battery precisely in the required position - hence the intermittent operation. I can't explain why some people have no problem with this unit and it works fine for them, as this seems to me to be a flawed design issue. All I can say is that mine was unusable and I returned it."
4,Childhood Memories,"I read an abridged version as a youngster many, many years ago, before I discovered and became passionate about Sir Richard F. Burton and his exploits, and have continued to reread the book throughout my life. Because I move around so much, and always give the book to good friends as a present, I find myself having to buy it again and again. Of course I don't mind at all! The tales always take me back to that first time I read them, and bring me forward as I read them into my own life. It's like a story within the story. I am looking forward to giving this book to my children as a present. It will be fantastic! I'll introduce them to Burton and let the book's magic capture their imaginations, just like it did me."
5,Classic for all ages,"I have been searching for an Arabian Nights book for months. The only books I found were rewrites for children. Then I came across this masterpiece. While it was alittle hard to read at first (because of the old english used), I was soon drawn into the enchanting stories held within. This has all the classic ""Nights"" tales that we grew up with (Alladin, Ali Babba, Sinbad) plus many, many more! They will undoubtably grab you and draw you in. I highly recommend this to anyone! You won't be dissapointed!"
2,This bugs me...........,"I really annoys me when people call the ""Thousand and One Nights"" the ""Arabian Nights"". These tales are mostly Persian, the story of Shahrzade is Persian, etc. Shahrzade is a Persian name, still popular today in Iran, meaning ""city born"". Shahrzade was a Persian princess married to a Persian Sultan (Shah), telling tales that wouldn't have any reason to not be Persian, right? I don't see what the big mystery is as to what culture it came from when the origional book ""The Thousand Tales"", was written in Persia in Persian! Man, people need to get their facts strait! One reviewer said that this book was a great introduction into Arab culture???...The stories in the book are O.K., I've read better versions, so I'll give it 2 stars, but I'm subtracting 3 because of the confused info given to unsuspecting readers."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most boring book that I have ever read! There are about a million words that you have to look up in the dictionary and if you are looking up words the whole time you don't even get a chance to read the book.
1,The Reader distroys the experience,"I love arabian nights it has always been a favorite of mine, but the reader of this audio book is so boring, it makes it seem like he is reading the entire book in verse. He has a set melody he reads to; like a rollercoster he has to make his voice go up and down even if it is so completely contrary to the story , so that he is emphasizing words based on this sing song not on what is actually happening in the story. It is like he is reading rhyming poetry badly, or singing some kind of spoken song, but what becomes lost is the actual content of the story. he is more concerned with making the words patterned in some rigid way, that the story is unimportant. Which is the very thing that is wonderful about the arabian nights, the stories."
4,Finally a convenient edition,Folklore anthologies far poorly in kindle because few have an active contents. This one however has links to every story. This makes it well worth the extra money.
4,Not for the young,"I am still reading this selection. I am surprised at the length and content, I have read quite a few of the stories and I am only at 4% (I think I will be reading this for the rest of the summer, it is easy to put down and pick back up). It is not the light hearted book of fables I used to read to my daughter. The stories are good (but quite raunchy when you read between the lines), and I have skipped most of the poetry (its repetitive). Some words have extra spaces, but I have gotten used to that. I do appreciate the footnotes and they are a plus for edifying some word usages. There is much sexism and violence towards women, but it is to be expected, considering the time and place. All in all a good read, so far."
1,Some Nights Are Missing,"This is not the Complete Arabian Nights, some nights are missing, I bought this E-Book for a particular night- ""Ma'aruf The Cobbler And His Wife Fatimah"", but it was not there.I think it's better to buy the Paperback edition to get all 1001 nights, or what we Arabs call it ""Alf Laila wa Laila""."
4,And now for something completely different!,Happily married man feels suddenly fatigued at the Christmas dinner he and his new wife have given on their return from their honeymoon. He goes upstairs to lie down and realizes as he watches himself sleeping that he has died! He must now solve rhe mystery of who murdered him to save his wife from being convicted. Why was this gem never made into a movie?!
1,Auto Fundamentals Workbook,Don't buy this book if you are looking for a overall summary of how cars work. Buy the textbook with the same name as the workbook adds nothing to the reference/learning process
1,Workbook not Textbook!,Be aware this is the workbook not the textbook. Some reviews of this product seem as though they were written with the textbook in mind.

5,Awesome wristbands!,"I recently got into Naruto and ordered two of these things, since Sound is one of my favorite village. They came VERY soon - the expected date was between the 15th and the 18th, and they came on the 12th!!I am very happy with the product, as the wristbands themselves are made of a good material, and the metal piece easily bends to fit your wrist.You only get one wristband per order though, so buy two if you want one for each wrist. They are very comfortable and warm and I have been wearing them all day!"
2,Academic exercise,"This book was written after Professor Bringsjord devised a schema for the genre by studying the plots of other techno-thrillers (for example, The Hunt for Red October.) The book puts his theory of the techno-thriller plot into practice. At that time, he was seeking funding for a ten-year project on computer generated fiction, and having a published novel was part of that strategy."
4,Pretty good,"Continuing the story from vol 1. and it does it well enough. The art is pretty good and can be arousing. These books are fun and kinky enough, worth checking out a volume for yourself."
2,"ARTWORK IS OK, BUT THE STORY IS REALLY LAME","I bought the graphic novel CASA HOWHARD on a whim when I purchased the excellent BANANA GAMES by Christian Zanier.The artwork in Casa Howhard is OK, but the story is really bad. It is written as if the author was a 12-year-old boy with no sexual experience at all, and with only a child's immature ideas of adult motivation and passion.I can't imagine anyone buying this book on purpose. A waste of money."
4,Pretty Good,"This is the third tripod I have tried. I really wanted something a little lighter that the 4.4lbs of this unit, but I compromised because I wanted to the flip lever leg locks. I tried an aluminum Manfrotto that was similar to this model, but it was too heavy. I then tried a SLIK 814 CFII and if it had not been for the pain in setting it up and taking it down I would have kept it. If SLIK made a model with lever locks I would be all over that. I would happily shell out the higher $$ for a Gitzo as well if they had lever locks on the legs. I will probably end up buying a monopod as well for travel as I don't see it being very practical to haul this one around. All of that said, this is a fine unit that sets up quickly, is sturdy, lighter than aluminum and has the added bonus of a spirit level. I would recommend this unit to others who feel the same way I do about twist to lock tripod legs."
4,Tripod worth a try...,"I have been using this tripod for over 2 years now and I am very pleased with it's performance. Quick and easy to set-up and/or break down, sturdy, can be leveled quickly with the aid of the built in bubble level. Personally I prefer the ""lever's"" for locking and unlocking the legs just seem faster to me then the ""twist/turn"" style. And so far I have never pinched a finger. This has been with me on vacation and many other various places granted it doesn't see as much use as my monopod (Manfrotto 680 COMPACT MONOPOD - Monopod- needless to say even easier to carry and set-up/break down and can be used in crowded places) but it has been around the block a few times.If I was to say anything negative it would be the carrying strap is too short and if it was more adjustable. Also this in not really a travelling tripod although it does fit nicely in my suite case. I am not bothered by the weight just if it where more compact, but for me it's a keeper"
4,Great tripod,"Great tripod, built to last, only issue is the handle is too short to put it over your back"
4,Good deal!,"This cartridge is a great deal, containing multiple games at a lower cost than most other Gameboy Advance cartridges. My husband has enjoyed playing these games which he used to play at the arcades 'way back when', and is happy with the quality. My seven-year old son finds the games fun and a bit challenging without being daunting. The hours of enjoyment they're getting from these games make the cartridge even more worth the price!"
4,Is That Galaga in Your Pocket...?,"It's like having my own portable Aladdin's Castle! If you don't know what that is you're too young to truly enjoy this collection. This is a great game(s)! Ms. Pac-man, Dig-Dug, and most importantly GALAGA! If you used to shovel quarters into these games as a kid, you won't be disappointed with this cart. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there really should have been more games on the cart. C'mon, you expect me to believe that the simple pixels that make up these games take up all that memory? I suspect this will not be the only ""Museum"" cart that Namco puts out...but I'll probably buy those as well. I was also surprised at how addictive these games still are. My wife tapped me on the shoulder last night and said, ""Do you realize that you've been playing 'Galaga' for 2 hours straight?"". Can't get enough of the classics!"
3,Almost but not quite,"Its fun to be able to play favorite classics and its even better when you can take it with you. Never mind that Namco could have easily placed more games on to one cartridge or even selected a different set of games to bring to the Game Boy Advance. For the most part, the game screens are too small to appreciate. Galaga is almost too dark even under good light. Dig Dug is entertaining but again the screen is just too small to get the most out of it. Ms. Pacman is the only game on the cartridge that allows for the choice of screen formats - fit to screen or scrolling. I highly recommend selecting scrolling since that makes it easier on the eye's and the added challenge of not knowing exactly where ""Blinky"" is going to pop up. Don't get me wrong, being able to carry around arcade classics in your back pocket is great, however, due to the small game screens and often too dark display, I found it more frustrating and neck breaking than I can appreciate."
4,Classic!,My son is 10 and enjoys this game greatly. I was very nostalgic for the old games...ah the hours on Pole Position. My 6 year old daughter also enjoys this quartet of oldies. The familial competition is fierce. Graphics have not been ruined in an attempt to lure a younger audience. The game is great.
3,A little boring,"Don't get me wrong, at first this game is fun, but after a while it gets tiresome. Even with 6 games, it lacks. Unless you really want to get that high score in Dig-Dug, or want first place in Pole Position, there are other GBA titles that will give you more bang for your buck."
3,Good if you keep your expectations in check,"For this price it's a great throw away cartridge for old guys like myself ;-) Funny thing is, my 5 year old plays it more than I do.My only complaint it that the GB SP screen is WAY too small for these games. They were designed to be played on really large screens and it shows."
3,multi games,"I like the fact that you're getting four games in one.The games are true to form, just like the originals. I wish the Pacman screen was bigger, though."
5,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!,"This is game is so cool! Anyone who is old enough to remember going to the arcade in the 80's will absolutely love this game! Each of the five games on this cartridge (Ms. Pac Man, Pole Position, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Galaxian) looks and sounds just like the old arcade games, and far, far better than your old Atari 2600 ever did! I highly recommend this game!"
2,Get the console version- this one isn't as good.,"I bought this GBA game(well, actually my grandma did) and I'm pretty sorry I chose this one. There are two things that I don't like about this cart. First, I love the challenge of beating my own high scores but you can't save your high scores. Second, there is no rapid fire in Galaga and Galaxian. If I hold down the button, it only fires once. You have to keep pressing the button to fire. This really slows the game down. It takes twice as long to defeat one wave of enemies as it does in Microsoft's Return of Arcade for the PC. Those games aren't as fun on the GBA. Aside from those two flaws, there's nothing else to critisize."
2,NO Battery Backup for your high scores!!!,"This game is worthless it contains no battery backup for your high scores. What the heck is the point of playing any of these games if it doesn't record your scores? Waste of time and money. .... DO NOT BUY. And be cautious about the release of Pac-Man Fever on Gameboy Advance, find out if it has a battery backup before you buy."
2,"I can't put it nicer - It """".","I hate to do this because these games are classics, but this game is definitely NOT worth the money. A friedn of mine bought this exact game for the PS1 and he got sick of it fast (I played it for 30 minutes once and I couldn't stand playing anymore) Don't get me wrong, these games were cool when they first came out, but at this point in time, they have been as overplayed as Britney Spears's ""Hit Me Baby One More Time."" You can download similar versions of these games online for free! If I were a collector and had to have all things namco, I'd buy this, but since I'm not, I'm not going to. Again, if you really like these classic games and don't get sick of playing them frequently, feel free to buy this game. I turst Namco can bame better new stuff!"
4,Hours of thumb madness in your pocket.,"5 classic arcade games in your pocket ready for action at a moments notice is something no core gamer can be without. First off Pac Man (and the much better Ms. Pac Man) is video game crack, the hours I put into this game over the years speaks for itself. Second, Dig Dug is a game much deeper than it seems and will keep you busy for hours. Third is F-Rally, which may be the weakest title here. It's essentially a rehash of Pac Man with cars instead of ghosts and it plays as you'd expect. Not bad, just a little shallow considering the other games. And finally, GALAGA! What more can I say? One of the most addictive shooters in arcade history in your pocket, or back pack or whatever. Great combo of classics for a great price."
4,Remember when...,I'm almost 30 years old and bought this game for my son and I enjoy playing it myself because it's got the classic games that I played when I was a kid. It arrived very quickly in the mail too.
4,Classics!,"I'm always late to the gaming community - I just now asked for and received a Nintendo Micro for Christmas. I had a hankering to get my hands on the classics, but I bought this game specifically for Dig Dug.What can I say? They're just like I remember playing. Pole Position is all but impossible to manage using the d-pad to control direction, so I don't see myself getting much use out of that game, but the others are a ton of fun. I haven't played any of these games in years, but they're turning out to be quite addictive."
3,Classic arcade comes to GBA,"First of all, I think it is important to know that there are five games in this collection, not just the four on the cover. The other one is Galaxia, which is a shooter game quite similar to Galaga. These games are really simple, so people might think they aren't as engaging as most of the games out there. But I guess this simplicity is part of the appeal. I like the Ms. Pacman the best, and it's nice because you can choose between full screen and scroll screen. All in all, I'd say if you like the classic arcade games you'll like this game. Buy it used though, it's not worth paying full price."
3,You can't save your high scores,"As a 34-y old gamer i have played ms-pacman a lot on the coin-ops, and for this reason alone i bought the game for 40($45). Problem however is: where is the point in playing any one of these games if the hiscore is erased every time you power-off the console?This is a very serious game spoiler for me because the only fun left is the sensation of actually moving around in a maze and that is boring after an hour or so.The other games, Galaga and Galaxian, have the problem that the slowly moving stars in the background tend to blend in with the fast moving missiles coming at you, with the result that you lose lifes just because you didn't see 'em coming. I played those gala* games on the MSX when i was 14 and never had that problem, then. Essentially it boils down to this: the gba screen size is too small (in cm) to enjoy the game. Rent it."
5,You can't fail if you follow this simple success system.,"In less than a year, your whole life will be changed. This book gives you a step by step easy to use formula for personal, spiritual, and financial success. You must ask yourself: ""where do I want to be a year from now?"" And then read this book, and you will be there."
4,Pleased,Thankful for the value to get a book w/ shpg for the price of the book itself if bought in a book store. Arrived in the standard time promised. RFT
2,Inferior Books from Amazon Sellers,"While the book did arrive promptly and in the New Condition advertised, after a few readings the pages began to separate from the spine!As a result of this experience, I do not recommend this Seller to anyone looking for quality in their purchase ~"
3,ok,"i think this song is ok. i dont really listen to moby, i like no doubt and that's really the only reason i like it as much as i do (which isn't much). coz i think gwen is much better staying to rock/ska/pop/reggae etc. i mean, let me blow ya mind was a really good song, too, but her voice is much better for no doubt style music."
1,If I could give it a negative score i would,"Like a negative one thousand or so. positively one of the worst songs of all time. We're talking like up there with Achy Breaky heart and every song the spice girls ever made. Moby has moved away from his electronic roots a lot on this track and it is absolutely terrible. Not to mention it contains some of the worst vocals from one of the worst vocalists ever, Gwen Steffani. Her glaring absence of talent confuses me every time I see her. And on this track she has gone even worse than ever before. I like moby and I like some of the songs on this new cd. But Southside is probably the worst song on it and why someone would buy the single of it is a mystery to me."
3,why don't i love this more?,"that was the question going through my head as i played my newest addition. i had seen the video and loved the song! i have the play album, but (somehow) hadn't heard that there was a version with gwen stefani helping out on vocals.so, i couldn't figure out why i thought this was so tepid. while her voice is still interesting to listen to, the music didn't seem very energetic. it played somewhat slowly - more attuned to moby's singing then hers. not at all what i remembered from the video.some quick searching on amazon helped answer the question. the video (i'm fairly sure) plays a remixed version. a version that has more of an energetic beat and is more in sync w/ gwen's energy. there is another version of this single - with much more limited ability - that has several remixed versions. i'm thinking, that that is the cd to buy. so, my recommendation is - go back to your search function and purchase that single."
4,a good album,"This was my introduction to Faust, and to the musical style of krautrock. Basically, this album is two long songs. THere is also a third song, but that is just an alternate take of the first song. This music is very minimal. Tony Conrad plays his viola or violin at a fairly constant note, maintaining a drone for the 20-minute songs. Meanwhile, Jean-Herve, Zappi, and another Faust guy plod along, not changing what they are playing very much, either. It's super repititious, and when Zappi finnaly has a drum fill, it is a big event. Now, a lot of people will find this boring, but I don't. The music has a very organic pulse to it, it seems very alive. I like this album a lot better that the other work I've heard by Tony COnrad. Faust are the perfect backing band for him. I don't listen to this album all that much, but when I do, I always enjoy it."
5,Barbie: A Place Called Home,"Actually, I wrote this book and I have no idea why the editors, Julie Temple Stan and Agnes Priscsak felt entitled to put their names on the book as authors! First time I've seen the finished book and I'm shocked at the strange practice of an editor taking credit for an author's work. Fortunately, I've written over 160 books with ONLY my name on them and so I wonder where ""author"" Julie Temple Stan's list of books might be?"
1,books,I have yet to receive this item. I suggest readers be wary when ordering from individual sellers.
3,review of coleman gas stove,"some what disappointed in colemans quality, surely made cheap compared to older ones. if i would have known this i would have bought an older one."
4,"Easy to operate, but not simple to fill","I love how easy this is to use. I quickly set it up and had it cooking dinner for my family in minutes. The only minus, is that the hole to the fuel tank is smaller then any of the standard gas can pour nozzles I have, and even the funnel I use to put oil in my car was to wide for it, which made filling it up a bit of a task. I saw that there are a couple of funnels, specifically for the Coleman Liquid Fuel products, for $8.00. The reviews all highly recommend it. With my experience, I would also recommend that you get something like that to help put fuel in it."
4,Loved it,"This is a great book - so happy i randomly picked this up and started reading. It immediately draws you in, and really never stops. A fantastic tale of the old west, about the Sacket Family. I was up at my grandparents farm in upstate NY, and looking at some old books, picked this one up and just dug in. It really hit the spot - just the type of story i was looking for! Pure enjoyment. Can't wait to read more. Anyone have any suggestions?"
2,Really bad later work by Caldwell,"Erskine Caldwell's two Depression-era novels, TOBACCO ROAD and GOD'S LITTLE ACRE, were excellent.This novel is not.It's as if he tried to transplant some of his minor characters from the 30s into 70s suburbia.It doesn't work."
2,don't waste your money...,"The Breyer HORSE SENSE game is not worth a dollar. The questions are not challenging at all!!! Even little kids will find it silly! For example (from the cards): WHAT IS AN EQUINE VETERNARIAN? a. a duck doctor b. a water scientest c. a vet who specializes in horses\WHAT IS A HORSE'S DIET COMPOSED OF? a. cotton candy and soda, b. chips and candy, c. grains and bulk foods? A HORSE USES ITS TAIL TO? a. brush its teeth b. swish off flies c. look pretty.As you can see, HORSE SENSE is really not worth ANYTHING! Don't waste your money, get HERD YOUR HORSES."
4,Good game,This is a great game for anyone with an interest in horses. It is educational while having fun. My daughter was 10 at the time I bought it and it suited her and her friends well.
3,Fun for a few games,My 9 year old loves horses so I had been looking for this game for her. I was happy to find it at Ollie's for $7. Many of the questions are very easy but she gets a laugh at the silly answer options. Some of the questions are a bit more challenging and she has learned a lot but after you play the game a few time you remember all the answers and it is not so fun. I am glad we got it for the price we did but I would not recommend paying a lot for it.
5,It's about time ...,"For a long time, I've been wondering what has happened to the small literary magazine. It seems that Klim (editor & contributor) has redefined its current status by reintroducing the staple mix of stories, articles, and prose that made it famous. I really hope this one makes. The wide range of articles snapped me out of reading funk."
1,Oddly Boring,"I adore Radiohead, and really enjoy solo piano. I should love this disc, but I don't. Even though the wonderful creepiness of Radiohead is completely absent, I would be willing to chalk that up to artistic interpretation. But that's not what bugs me about this disc. What really bugs me is his style of playing. He relies on resonance and the transcript is completely devoid of silence. The result is a droning wall of notes, and all the pieces sound the same. It reminds me of Windham Hill recordings, but without the expression. Get Yorke's new album, Eraser, if you need a Radiohead fix, or get George Winston if you want solo Piano. I really wish I could recommend this, but I just can't."
3,Doesn't all hold up,"With his second run of the Radiohead catalog the pianist begins to lack a cohesive creation. Some of the treatments, more than on volume one, feel unnecessary here (they just don't appealingly translate to piano even with O'Riley's embellishments) but enough still works to have an EP's worth of showcase stuff."
1,Good effort,Sound all the same...listen to the samples before you buy it. If your a fan of radiohead you wont like it...if your a fan of the piano you wont like it. But I give my respect to the musician for making the effort to replicate already beutiful music.
1,Caveat emptor,"Just a head's up: I don't have this recording, but it seems very fishy. The movements from Smetana's Ma Vlast are out of order, and the sixth is missing. ""Dennis Zsoltay"" is a fictitious persona and the ""South-German Philharmonic"" is a pseudonym for a ragtag band of Czech and German musicians assembled by the shady Alfred Scholz in the 70s (his attribution here as a conductor is quite possibly just as pseudonymous). So if you want to hear Ma Vlast properly, don't fall for the dirt-cheap price and look elsewhere (I'd suggest Dorati or Kubelik's version)."
3,Lovely globe - in the wrong language,"Loved the globe; however, gave it for a Christmas present & that's when I realized it was in Spanish. There was nothing in the description nor in the ordering process which said it was in another language so unfortunately had to return it."
1,Save Your Money,My kids are pretty gentle but this globe broke within a matter of days. The base cracked and then the globe split apart at the seam. I guess this would be an OK globe for decorative purposes but definitely not a 'hands on' product for kids.
4,Good deal for the price,We bought two of these for our sons for Christmas. We have only had them for 2 weeks but they really like them and it seems like a good quality product. It was at the lower end of the price scale. I was not able to find any at the local stores where we live. I would definitely recommend it.
5,well worth the money,"The book offers a thorough biography, a thorough plot synopsis of each opera, and a thorough technical analysis.It is enlightening to read the book while following along with the score of each opera.In his technical analysis, however, he sometimes misses the forest for the trees. He neglects to tell us that the prelude to Manon Lescaut is in the rondo form, the prelude to Madama Butterfly is in the sonatina form, or that the waltz in Il Tabarro is in the rondo form.Also, there is one question which the author leaves unanswered: What is the purpose of the mock funeral in Edgar? If you happen to know the answer to this question, please write back."
1,Design Flaw,"This camera has a design flaw. The integrated microphone does NOT shut off when you use an auxilary microphone. It says in the manual that it is supposed to. I sent it back to JVC many times, and the service personal compensated me by disconnecting the internal microphone permanently.If you want flexability in your audio, and you're an intermediate user, keep on looking. It's a shame cause in every other category, this is a great camera for the price."
4,Still works since 2005,"I've been using the GR-DR550U without problem since around 2005. I have taken it on many vacations and it works well for the price with no problems ever. It is a great video camera if you are in the market for Standard Digital video recorder and are happy with that quality, however I am getting rid of it because I am ready to step up to AVCHD recording.The features I liked were: 4-pin Firewire out, Mini USB out, mic input, 15 X zoom, easy menu, 12 or 16 bit audio recording, and added SD slot for video thumbnails & pictures - Note: at 1.33 Mega-pixel the pictures are better used for scene place marking rather than pictures to keep as masters (i.e. Bring your good digital camera too when traveling)."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"I bought this camera for inflight videos. It is one of the few cameras that has a mic input, a remote control, accepts the tape from the top, and has an appreciable optical zoom all in one package.It works for recording videos from the cockpit as well as recording radio communications between the pilot and air traffic control. Makes a perfect accessory to pilots who want to learn from their experiences.The downside is poor battery life, and LOUD hissing when using the onboard mic. If you want to use this for home video, use a separate mic."
4,Single CCD,"In response to Mehul Bavishi, this is not a 3CCD camcorder. According to their literature, it is a single 1/4.5"" CCD."
3,Bundle,"I was a little iffy when I purchased these items. It seemed like the quality of the products were real poor. But so far they have been living it up to their potential by getting the job done. Good buy, good buy!"
5,Perfect order and transaction,"Good price fast shipping and perfact conditions, what else do you want?Thanks Amazon"
5,Great price..and they all work!,"Was very pleased when i received this package. Anyone who has a cell phone would agree.. the phone charger, car charger, and the disc and cable for your phone to download pictures to your computer. An amazing deal!"
1,No good,"Didn't work on my phone (Gravity) but worked on the Impression...Also, connector fell apart in a week.. This was after only night-time charging use! Didn't carry it around, so I have to give this a failure rating."
2,Wasn't happy with purchase,Wasn't happy with this purchase . Company was made aware and I received a full refund . Thanks . This company really tries to make sure that their customers are pleased .
1,Misleading product description,"The product description clearly states that this is s 5 tape pack and the summary description at the top states the price is for one pack, not for one tape. But it is only for one tape. The company says the description is for one tape and refuses to make any adjustment or to refund shipping and handling. PC Connection has the same tape for $31, including shipping & H."
3,Pickwick Papers,"Better known for his epic novels of greater length, Dickens captures a more insular atmosphere with his humorous and possible satirical Pickwick Papers. This animated collection of the ghost stories from this work is a charming introduction for any audience that has not already been exposed to this particular work, or any works of Dickens. The vignette that stands out is the Sexton that was kidnapped by the goblins. Yet again he peels back the layers of human psyche by means of the supernatural to give his central character a change of heart. I highly recommend this film. I plan on purchasing a second copy and look forward to purchasing the live action Pickwick Papers of 1952."
3,Slow Game,I bought this game for my cousin hoping for a much better game then it ended up being. It moved very slowly. The only interesting part was when you landed on certain squares where you got to either tell the truth or lie and everyone else had to guess what you were doing. Unluckly we only landed on those once or twice in the whole game. Overall I was not impressed with this game.
3,Piano Tuner,"like many of this genre, very well drawn but the story lackssubstance and depth. One would hope for a good balance but muchlike the Heavy Metal books that preceded this the writing falls short."
4,Not the bear that is pictured,"The bear is cute and was a great buy. However, be aware that the picture on Amazon with the cute little bear and bag is not what you will be receiving. Check elsewhere for the Wild Colors bear to see what you'll be getting. (This is as of 1/4/08 - they could later replace the image with the correct one)."
1,Ditto...old episode.,I am a little disappointed Amazon didn't catch this. This is an old episode...please install the August 29th episode of Dance Moms. Thanks!
1,I want my money back! This is an old episode!,"This is not the episode from 8/28/12, it's much older. DO NOT BUY THIS EPISODE until they fix the problem, it is not the newest episode. I would either like my money back or the episode I tried to purchase."
4,Deliciously ridiculous!!,"If you like season one of dance moms, this season starts up with a bang and raises the silly caddyness to a whole new level. It is really quite fantastic-shameless reality at its best. If you do not like reality tv, definitely skip it. If you love reality tv but it right now!!!"
4,Dan ce moms is my guilty secret!,"I really enjoy watching the kids dance and the moms interact too, , but I CAN NOT STAND ABBY LEE MILLER! She is the most selfish person on tv. She doesn't care at all about those kids , only herself@"
1,WHAT THE HECK....YOU HAVE HAD WAY TOO MANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT GIVING US AN OLD EPISODE...,I HAVE WRITTEN! I HAVE EMAILED! WHERE IS THE NEW EPISODE? I PURCHASED THE SEASON NOT REPEATED SHOWS! HELLO HELLO!
1,Money back or correct episode,This is the wrong episode and I hope they correct this problem soon. It is irritating. Please fix this!!!!!!!! Even writing a review is a pain on here.
1,Old episode,This is an old episode of Dance Moms. Don't waste your money on it until Amazon has fixed the issue. Hopefully those who have purchased it will be refunded.
1,Not it,"I subscribe to the season so I bought this automatically. I now own the same episode twice. The episodes have been posting to the lifetime site before I get them, now this. I am not happy."
3,"Whose rating this, anyway?","Okay, it would be totally unfair for me to give the rating I'd like to give (ONE star!) for this 'drivel.' (that's my mother's word - the word i had to hear all the time when i was a kid and watched some crap my mother did not approve of!) So, yes, my daughters watch Dance Moms. And I cringe every time.Here's what I love about Dance Moms - It makes me seem like the most sane parent on earth. I think it actually makes my 11 & 13 year old daughters appreciate how sane I am (have you met a 13-y-o girl? that's no easy feat).Here's what I hate about Dance Moms - the dance teacher is insane, verbally abusive, and passive aggressive. Poor girls. The moms are pawning their children to live some life they never did, or wish they could, or just to be on TV. Poor girls.I gave it 3 stars for the simplicity of downloading some drivel that my kids really enjoy and making it easy for them to watch what they want. Making me, again, a rockstar . . . for saying yes."
1,nuts but cracklike,must be staged cause its not believable. still i watch and love it. abby is crazy and there must by macho editing. the girls are soooo talented though.
1,Doesnt work,This product didn't work. It wouldnt let me watch the show at all. Major disappointment. What a waste of money. I'd give it a zero star rating but it wont let me
3,"Chords, But Little Else","This book will teach you your chords with no problem. But it teaches you little else and playing any song only by changing chords and no real melody is not going to help much. The material in the book can be learned in about a week, and no sight-reading knowledge is necessary, but any decent music teacher or more complete course will teach you the same material just as easily. And without the knowledge to read music, you won't be able to play songs anyway, unless you can play by ear, in which case you wouldn't need this book either! But it does what it promises. If you just want to know your chords and nothing else, this book delivers."
4,Excellent compilation,"This is a greast cd with one major flaw. The cd is loaded with great PPL originals but for some reason, the compilers included the band's very average cover of the great Buddy Holly song ""That will be the Day"". This track makes the band sound no better than a run of the mill, hotel bar lounge band covering a hit song. Skip this track and listen to the great original tracks on the cd. If you need That will be the Day"", by all means pull out a Buddy cd."
4,CD's,I am slowly replacing the cassette tapes that I cataloged and stored away. This is a good tape to have in my collection.
3,I have to dig deeper still,"My sister had a bunch o PPL records back in the 70's like ""Bustin Out""and the others. I remember liking ""Amie"" a lot, so I was looking for more of that vibe.I have to dig deeper on these guys, cause this one doesn't really do it for me.Like any Hits comp. it's a good place to start, but the liner notes talk of their later period, and a good catalog, so I think I'll look for their other records, to see if I can mine some of that 70's gold."
2,Hits???,"The only hit I recognized was ""Amie"". And that was the only song I really enjoyed! I wish I had not bought this CD."
2,Not a big fan,I wouldn't have bought this if it hadn't been used and cheap. I wasn't a huge fan to start with.
3,Great Music But..,"The sound quality is the worst of any post-70's CD in my collection. I have CD's recorded in the forties that sound better than this! Either the master tape has been lost or someone won't part with it long enough for a digital transfer to be made. This sounds like a copy of a copy of a copy of the master, and made on poor equipment to boot. This, however, is our reality, like it or not, and if you're like me and you must own it ""for better or worse"", then you'll pull out your wallet and be happy with it because the individual CD's that this is culled from don't sound any better. (sigh)"
5,great book,love all dr.spock's product. have a few of them. great reading. helps me prepare for what's to come.
2,A Let Down,"Now I love Batman, and the fact that I worship anything Batman is what got this thing the two stars. I even loved the first Black and White. I thought it was art and fascinating. But oh man is this a huge let down. The stories are so boring I could barely force myself to read it and the art is extremely unimpressive. This isn't just a waste of money, it's a waste of your time. Sorry Batman, you failed me here."
1,Sooooo Many Mistakes in this book - shame shame shame!,"This instant-expert in Hawaiiana is evidently one of those people who move to Hawaii and think ""it's much too good for the Hawaiians so I'll sell as much of it as I can"". The photography is good but so many of the descriptions are soooooo wrong that I looked through it in slack-jawed amazement. Don't fall for this phoney-baloney aloha - the real Hawaii is not for sale, no matter how many books you write badly about it."
3,Not so macabre,"The title is a bit misleading as I've found this book to be more of collection of random and rather vague tidbits of bizarre (and a few space-filling) facts. It is interesting, just not nearly as dark as the title/description would have you believe. (i.e. I didn't find the fact describing the number of bridges between the mouth of River Thames and Teddingtonto be that particularly ""horrifying""). I you want something that goes into a lot more detail, I'd highly recommend that you check out another of Abbott's books: ""The Book of Execution: An Encyclopedia of Methods of Judicial Execution..."""
2,This book WAS NOT GOOD!,"The plot of ""Channel X"" was disappointing and it just plain freaked me out. It's one of Laurie John and Francine Pascal's worst. I never want to read another book as bad as this one. My rating, a 3."
1,Probably the worst written book that Pascal has ever written,"I found this book to be very boring. I lost interest in it very fast. Stupid plot,could've written something better. Not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend this book because it was pointless."
2,I could have wrote better,"This was ok, but i feel their could have been more excitmentand a better plot. It was farfetched, and too boring."
1,BORING!!!!!,"I got this book thinking it would be really good and action packed! Oh dear, I have just wasted my money on one of the boring SVU books ever! Nina is just soooooo dull! And Brian is no better - the ending sucked, and Liz was hardly in it - a shame because she is a lot more interesting than Nina is and ever was! Jess and her friends are not even in it at all! Which means there were no light moments of comic relief involving Jess - it was AWFUL! I regret wasting my money on it! Please Francine - NEVER AGAIN!"
3,Dull at times,"This book had a LOT of Nina, and you can take that remark as you wish. We know that Nina is very studious and that could lead to a boring plot. Which it did. There have definitley been worse books, but this book cannot be ranked up there with action paced suspense stories, such as Dead Before Dawn. You may want to think twice about this book before you decide to buy it."
3,Some Signs of Brilliance,"Another addition to the ""asian underground"" genre, Badmarsh & Shri deliver a convincing and interesting achievement. ""Signs"" mixes techno, trip-hop, funk, big beat, ambient, electro, world music, pop and other influences to present an ecclectic and diverse album. The first song is one of the best of the bunch, similar to some Massive Attack`s efforts (always a good reference), and the rest of the tracks are mostly worth a listen as well. Even though it has a couple of filler moments, ""Signs"" is quite a decent album, sadly overlooked and way above average.Enjoyable enough."
2,Derivative,"This album did not keep my interest for more than a couple scant minutes. I checked it out as ... recommendation and boy was I disappointed. Initially, the aural landscapes were interesting from song to song, though they would start and remain the same for the net 5 1/2 minutes until the song ended. The music simply never WENT anywhere, unlike similar fare ... which keeps you mesmerized with its constant undulation. With little variation and lame rapping about psuedo-trance-endental nonsense, this played like a bad club album. Boring and derivative......"
3,Badmarsh & Shri - Signs,"SIGNS continues Badmarsh & Shri's Indo-techno, though this release sounds fuller than their first album. The drums on the title track, for instance, have a depth that was lacking earlier (the vocals help as well), while ""Swarm"" has some acid going on. There's also a prominent dub presence, whether in different guest vocalists or in the deeper bass hits. ""Day by Day"" works better as a pop song than ""The Air I Breathe,"" and the female Indian vocals on ""Sajanna"" approach blissfulness. Indeed, the delicacy of ""Soaring Beyond"" and ""The Last Mile"" shows them stronger at establishing moods. But their beat-craft remains solid too, as on the the breaks and rhythmic chattering of ""Bang."" ""Appa"" ends the album on a sweet, almost tender, note. A strong step forward."
4,"Good read, but a bit zealous in the feminist approach","This is definitely worth the read of it, but the author does have (and freely admits she has) a strong feminist bias, and so if you are trying to read from a non-feminist perspective you need to have your appropriate filters in place. Still, the material is clear, well written and includes a good mix of first-hand accounts and generalized commentary."
3,A good idea that falls just short,"This book is true to its title. Nobles. It contains new core classes, prestige classes, feats, skill uses, campaign ideas, and character concepts for playing a noble character. Unfortunately it is a bit flat. There is some intersting information on the benefits of being a follower of a noble house, with those benefits scaling for the size and prestige of the house. But its not quite enough to match Green Ronins usually steller items."
5,The Peaks,"One of the many things Kate Niles does beautifully in The Basket Maker is create a voice with the setting. In the Southwest, the land is not just a backdrop, the land is a character, and Kate brings it to life by having the Peaks tell pieces of the story. The rest of the characters are vivid and real, and reading about the town makes me homesick for the real one it's based on! This is an amazing first novel by one of my favorite professors and I'm anxiously awaiting the next one!"
5,Touching story for basenji lovers of all ages,"This story is not only wonderful for children, but also adult basenji lovers. A must for ever family who has ever had or known a basenji. Candle will find a place in your heart forever!"
5,Horses and a dysfunctional family,"A multimillionaire finds himself the target of a murderer and suspects one of his many children, children in law or ex-wives.He enlists his middle son, an amateur jockey, as bodyguard and investigator.The large list of suspects gives Francis a chance to do what he does best-develop characters.One of his best."
4,Horses and a family feud,"One of Dick Francis' best. Although written from the point of view of Malcomb Pembroke's middle son, Malcomb himself is the main character. Interesting family dynamic. Of course, there are always horses and races."
5,Old-Fashioned Mystery,"More so than many of Francis' books, this one is all about hidden motives, more in the style of Agatha Christie. The ending will break your heart."
3,Not as hot as other Francis books...,"I rank Dick Francis in the top 5 fiction authors writing. He consistently puts out great mysteries with characters devoted to their values and plots interesting enough to keep me coming back for more.""Hot Money"" is not one of his best. I found his main character in this novel too willing to compromise on issues that I wouldn't have expected Francis to compromise on. I still recommend this book but with some minor reservations."
1,Tedious,"I usually quite enjoy Dick Francis's books, but I found Hot Money to be tedious in the extreme. There were too many possible suspects with all the many Pembrokes. Reading the review of the P.I.'s notes on their whereabouts for the times of the two attacks was like doing a homework review.And they were all so pitiful and odious - Ian's patience with the lot was completely unbelievable and frustrating. My least favorite Francis by far."
1,astounded at others' ratings,"I have benefited greatly from Amazon readers' reviews, but not this time. I find the many 5 star ratings astounding. This is by far the weakest Dick Francis novel I have ever read -- and I have read nearly all of them. Turgid, tedious, a story line overwhelmed by intricate family details -- these are just a few of my thoughta. Reader, pass by!"
5,Undiscovered talent!,Great cd for any mood you're in. I highly recommend checking out this underappreciated group before they blow up big. How can 2 sisters so young be so talented?!
5,Kabbalah's evolution,"This is an interesting study of the Jewish Kabbalah. Each of the 6 chapters deals with a theme and using different sources for the Kabbalah like the Bahir, Gershom takes a look at how Kabbalists saw these subjects and how their views of these subjects evolved in Kabalistic circles."
3,It should have been called The Ambassador Hotel...!,"While this film had some touching moments, and the interjection of real footage with fake new film footage was done well, for the most part this film tries to be too much to too many causes. And the only cause it should have been concentrating on was that of Robert Kennedy!I lived through the day this actually happend...and I don't believe this film captured the horror of that place and time. His words being spoken as a narrative in some spots in the film was touching and interesting to hear again in this year of 2007....but the overall film failed on many levels. I think 3 stars here are generous...2 may have been the correct number to give. And why this film had an ""R"" rating is beyond me? All those sexy actresses, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, and no nudity? What a waste of talent!"
3,John Casey,"My interest in this film started about six months prior to its release when I discovered, quite by accident, that my father's name and career we to be used in a film!My father, John Casey, was a doorman at the Ambassador Hotel from 1928 to 1965. He had a front row seat on the history of Los Angeles. The real John Casey was indeed retired at the time of JFK's assassination.The film is of interest to anyone from that era. However, I found it somewhat fragmented. There were too many stories that did not relate to one another, and too little of RFK himself.I was glad to see that Anthony Hopkins portrayed my father as a gentleman, which he was. Other than that, my father never played chess and certainly did not go back to ""hang around"" the ambassador.I will buy the DVD when it is released as a family memento.John Casey"
1,Everyone here is a stereotype,"This reminds me of one of those big all-star cast disaster flicks from the 70s. Plenty of big stars signed on. The script is the problem here. It turns everyone into a cliche and stereotype: the drugged out LSD-addled 60s hippy; the bride-to-be getting married to spare a kid from the Vietnam draft; the alcoholic aging lounge singer; the Latino versus black conflicts on the hotel kitchen staff. And what are Anthony Hopkins and Harry Belafonte, besides two old men hanging out in the lobby of the now-demolished Ambassador Hotel? This fictionalizes the lives of all these players on the day and night leading up to the RFK assassination, interspersed with real footage of RFK campaigning etc. I didn't buy it. It's a little boring."
2,An utter waste of talent,"I realized shortly after it started that this film was meant to be evocative of the era when Bobby was killed. Unfortunately it failed dismally. I was a university senior at the time and this didn't give me the slightest sense of deja vu. It's obvious that few, if any, of the people involved in making this dud were alive at the time. As to the (usually) very talented cast, what happened? Most of them seemed to be sleepwalking through it all. Note to Freddy Rodriguez: If you don't want to be typecast as ""cutsey"", choose your roles more carefully. I wouldn't watch this again if I were bribed."
2,The story lets in down,The story itself is set in a hotel on the day where a US senator was assassinated. From the film you would think he was the great hope.Some of the characters I found interesting. Overall they came together well. Much of the acting was good which is not surprising as they were some good one there.The filming was good too.What I did not like was the overall story. I found it quite weak. Nothing grabbed me.
2,it was okay,interesting back drop of history. fun to see the different styles. but if you really want a slow film with substance this ain't it.
1,utter disappointment,"I couldn't watch this movie more than 30 minutes. I expected something totally different given the all star cast and glowing reviews on the case. The acting was horrible. It was like the actors decided, ""I am going to play this this way"" and had no regard for being part of a cast. The dialog was horrible. The actors had no relationship to one another (even in the same scene). But the worst part of it all was the hard to miss propoganda. I didn't want a social commentary on what is going on today. I don't want politics shoved down my throat. If I wanted to be part of a liberal dialog, I would listen to talk radio. I wanted to be entertained and this film failed miserably in doing that for so many reasons."
1,This Shot at RFK Backfired,"What a stinker!One stereotyped 60's character after another is paraded onto a boring movie.RFK is portrayed as the second coming (wait...wasn't JFK the 2nd coming...too bad Marilyn is dead, only she would be sure to know) and the answer to everythingthat Estevez and Papa Sheen and the rest of the Hollywood activist set believe is wrong with america. Gratuitous scenes of RFK with black people,but the movie gives patronizing roles to its black characters and has then live out stereotypes (typical white pinkolibs, eh?)This is just another tribute to the overidealized 60s."
4,Unusual narrative devices at work,"An unusual way to tell a story: this film focuses on many people (some more compelling than others, I must say) who were in the Ambassador Hotel at the time Robert Kennedy was assassinated as he moved through the kitchen. Instead of dealing with Kennedy directly or having an actor portray him, director Emilio Estevez instead uses footage and voice-overs, concentrating not just on the killing but on the death of idealism at the time. MLK was already gone, and then we lost RK as well.All the performers were quite good. I was not expecting Sharon Stone, Lindsey Lohan, or Demi Moore to be good at all, but they were. Seriously, what a shock!Excellent, rousing speech from Kennedy at the end. Does anybody write 'em like that anymore? Sadly, no. We get no inspiration these days except from Bono, and he can't run for President of the U.S."
3,Too many famous faces.,"Bobby written and directed by Emilo Estevz is a sensitive portrait of that horrific day at the Ambassodor Hotel in California where President hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy was shot to death by a crazed individual. There's the all-star cast which includes: Demi Moore, Elijah Wood, Lindsay Lohan, Sharon Stone, William H. Macy, Ashton Kutcher, Laurence Fishburne, Freddy Rodriguez, Christian Slater, Heather Graham, Anthony Hopkins, and Estevz himself. What the film fails to deliver is the life and legacy of Bobby. The film main focus is on the 22 individuals who experienced the presence of Bobby and is utter demise. Thank God for Simon and Garfunkel because their beautiful song, The Sound of Silence saves this self-involved tearjerker. Bobby would have been so much better if there were less Hollywood glamour and more political substance. Decide this one for yourself."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite movies with such a great cast. It goes to show how much Robert F. Kennedy meant to the world. He was such a great man. I highly reccommend this dvd. Not so great special features. But a powerful movie. Stars Laurence Fishburne, Heather Graham, Anthony Hopkins, Helen Hunt, Lindsay Lohan, William H. Macy, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Elijah Wood, Ashton Kutcher, Nick Cannon, Shia Lebeouf, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and many other stars. A+++"
2,Bobby is dead.,"Contrived, disingenuous... fake.Only three words were necessary.This movie will make a generation care less about something theyweren't interested in to begin with.If it had to be made, better to do so with an unknown cast.Some of the young actors couldn't hold the weight, some of theicons never get past their persona.Lindsay Lohan was quite good, as written. Sharon Stone meetsthe limits of her part, and is arguably the best thing here.If it were a DVD I would have turned it off after one hour,thirteen minutes.Bobby is dead."
4,"RFK, we need you","It brought me back to those times of turmoil in our country and someone who inspired us and gave us hope. Real TV footage & speaches by RFK. I purchased 3 of these, one at a time, and gave to friends of RFK's spirit.We need someone like RFK now."
3,MOVIE REVIEW,This movie was pretty good in the fact that it gave some historic information about the day Bobby Kennedy died. I had wanted to see it and couldn't find it for rental anywhere. Amazon always has what I want.
3,A worthwhile tome of Loch Ness evidence.,"Ronald Binns has clearly made a thorough search of the volumes of evidence relating to the Loch Ness enigma, as this detailed study covers and reveals many new thoeries and ideas promoted by lesser known 'authorities'. A book which I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject."
1,Beyond scepticism,"The Loch Ness debate rightly has its detractors; even if you're a believer a degree of scepticism is required. Well researched scepticism is a valuable counter-balance to the 'pro-monster' books and leads to intelligent debate. This book is not well researched, (there are many factual mistakes), in fact it doesn't do anything well. This is a true hatchet job. This does for Loch Ness what Goldman did for Elvis and Lennon. It is poorly written, vindictive, and has no sense of objectivity. It is malicious at a personal level to many people who have given a lot of time and effort in trying to solve this mystery. This is a truly horrible book, my advice is not to buy it. Better still, don't even borrow it."
1,rebranded Trico blade,"This blade is made by Trico and marketed by Bosch. Bosch sells so few your chances of getting really old stock are pretty good. Most people are happier with flat blades for winter driving, but flat blades don't have the lateral strength to ""plow"" through heavy wet snow and tend to skate over the top. If you must have a conventional winter blade you will usually get fresher rubber buying the much more popular Trico branded version of this blade."
1,Received dirty. Buyer beware.,I received this item in a firm plastic sleeve that might have been opened previously. The wiper inside was dirty. The other blade I ordered (same one in a different size) was in even worse condition. These are going right back to the sender.
2,Doesn't curve to fit the windshield,stays rigid and doesn't conform to the shape of the windshield. Good thing it's on the passenger side and doesn't really matter.
2,Streaky,"I got a matched set of these blades after having a normal set of Bosch blades ice up like crazy in Tahoe. I can't speak for the ice-resistant properties on these, but for normal rain they suck. They don't seem to mold at all to the curve of my windshield, leaving a good 2""-3"" on the left side of the driver's blade completely untouched, and the same on the right side of the passenger side. In addition, on the upstroke, they seem to sort of skid off the windshield, leaving water pool that doesn't actually get bladed off until the downstroke.I'll be going with another brand next time, although I'm not sure what."
1,Too long,"First one sent was 18 1/2"" long and ended up damaging the paint on my hood. The second one measured the same."
4,Bosch winter blades,"Got these after my Anco winter blades shredded themselves after 1 year of use. Although they appear to be physically IDENTICAL to the Anco blades, so far they appear to clean the glass better. Have been running them for about 1 month so far - hope they hold up. Not giving 5 stars as I'm not convinced the vinyl/rubber wrap designed to keep snow and ice off will be very durable, time will tell."
1,Save your money,"They tend to rise off the windshield like an airplane wing when driving at road speed due to air coming up from the bottom of the windshield. Of course, they do not wipe clean unless you're sitting still or driving slowly. Money wasted."
4,Great Value - Plus Prime,"Got these for our 1989 4Runner and they have held up well so far! They were also Amazon Prime, so the shipping was good. Overall they have been exactly as expected."
5,"Bosch 47720 Winter Wiper blade-20""","Nice fit, fast shipping, arrived in excellent condition, would highly recommend this site & will use them again. Thank you!"
2,not for curved windshields,"Purchased a number of these bosch blades, in various sizes for three cars. Blades installed on passenger side of Honda Accord are not curved enough to stay in contact with the window. When at rest, about 6 inches at the far side is off the glass. When in motion, that blade fully contacts the glass over only about 75% of the wiping area. Blade seems to have very little ability to accommodate curved windshields. Have used many brands before, never had this problem."
2,new blades,"For the price, these wipers are not as good as I would have hoped. They are really no better then any other brand you can buy at any auto parts store.Personally, I honestly doubt that anybody makes a decent long lasting wiper blade for summer or winter. It seems this is the only part of a car or truck that is stuck in time. Not getting any better as time goes by. I have been driving for 47 years and have been through a lot of different windshield wiper blades on a lot of different cars and trucks. They are about the same now as when I started driving. All the so called advancements are in my book, nothing but a bunch of hype. Bunk, B.S. ETC."
2,dissappointed,"Agree with other reviewer in that blade does not make uniform contact with windshield. Streaky brand new from box.I will see if I can modify it, bend it some, cause its not worth returning.Oh well lesson learned. If I want cheap I can always buy low end from Walmart/Autozone/ORileys. This is definatly a low end product."
5,Pemtax Batterygrip DBG2,"New to us, this tool did what we expected - add functions to the K10D, extended battery usage, place for a remote control. Great!"
2,Misleading ad,The battery grip is great and a good addition to a very good camera. My low rating is more for the supplier. The battery included is not a Pentax branded battery but an after market battery. The description leads you to think otherwise. The price would be good for the Pentax brand battery but is high for the battery you get.
4,Convenient...,"I agree wholeheartedly with C. Morrin ""CAM"" regarding the usefulness of having the digital card on the grip - how about making it active when the other one is full??? - I find it a bit cumbersome to have to open the battery compartment and replace my main card for the one in ""storage"" - they should've design this grip a bit better by having the camera read the card form the grip and not for one to have to change the thing manually - anyway, it's convenient to have an extra battery and a grip to take the photos in odd positions - still, I thing it's a bit overpriced for only two features...I still recommend it because of the functionality."
4,Admiral Halsey's typhoon,great book update to a much older version I had....The beginning of the weather service..and the great lost of lives and ships of our US Navy to these forces of nature.
5,"Compelling Tale, Grippingly Told","This is a LONG audiobook (over 10 hours), but I couldn't stop listening to it. It was incredibly compelling to hear the story of U.S. sailors before, during and after a devastating typhoon in the Pacific at a critical time in the Pacific Theater in World War II. The narrator, Eric Conger, has a voice that draws you in as you listen to the stories of the ships and crews in their daily lives, and how those lives are changed forever, for good or ill, by the typhoon, by the decisions made by the officers, and by their own actions and reactions to awsome and terrifying circumstances.I found myself liking some men, admiring many, and changing my opinions back and forth about some, as the story developed. I was surprised to hear of then Lieutenant, later President, Gerald Ford's heroic actions in a crisis.This was clearly well-researched and well-wtitten, and well worth a listen."
4,Halsey's Typhoon: the True Story of a Fighting Admirral.,This book is well written and easy to read. It seems that it has historical value and should be read by anyone interested in the Pacific Naval battles pursuing the defeat of the Japanese in WWII.
4,halsey's typhoon,a most informative book on ww2 history. presented in a most interesting way. i highly recommend this book
5,Husband Pleaser,I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas present. He could hardly put it down. He was in the Navy and said some of the passages took him back out to sea.......vivid memories.
1,Written by colege freshmen,"This book could have begun with ""It was a dark and stormy see"". The authors try to impress us with their vocabulary, often using archaic terms, and overuse adjectives. The writing is in the style of a bad romance novel with overuse of adjectives. Many of the similes are inappropriate for a sea story.My biggest complaint is reserved for the lack of citations. The book is filled with quotations, but there is no notes section to tell us where the quotes came from. The book might as well be labeled fiction. The magazine and newspaper section citations are lacking and the electronic sources section follows no style. Websites are listed with URLs nor access dates. In the miscellaneous section, one of the sources is history.navy.mil. The high schoolers I work with can put together better bibliographies."
5,900 Men Swept into the Philippine Sea. 90' Waves! 160 mph Winds!,"My father Wilson G. Scanlon, MD, from Mantua, Ohio, was a ship's doctor and Lt. Commander on the USS Alabama in WWII. He saw plenty of action (though not the typhoon) and told of American sailors plucking Japanese sailors from the sea. Even though books about WWII are not necessarily my thing, as ""Scan's"" daughter and a child of a naval officer, I found Halsey's Typhoon a gripping (if increasingly frightening) read from start to finish, and the list at the end of the book of the hundreds of dead, drowned or eaten-alive American sailors just stunning.My father's ashes were consigned to the sea two years ago."
5,Thrilling Work of Non Fiction,"Halsey's Typhoon is a remarkable work of non-fiction. I cannot say wether this story has ever been told but I'll bet it has never been told quite like this. Drury and Clavin are real writers and they demonstrate their craft on every page of this book. They put you right into the South Pacific during the war and the events that led to this great tragedy are told in compelling detail. Their brilliant characterizations (from the low level sailors who suffered the most, right up to Halsey himself) are spot on. The harrowing action scenes are deftly rendered - I don't think I will ever forget the scene where some of the men washed over board can hear their trapped comrades forlon tapping from the inside of a capsized ship. I usually shy away from War books, but I am glad I picked this up. Halsey's Typhoon is the best adventure book that I have read since The Perfect Storm"
5,Halsey's Typhoon; An excellent read,"I purchased this book because my grandpa was on a fleet tug and rode out the storm with the 3rd Fleet. It was neat to hear in depth about this huge storm and the brave men who survived it, especially after grandpa told me about it, but like many vets of his generation he didn't talk about it much in detail. It was a quick read and it kept me glued to the pages the entire way through. I reccomend it to anyone interetsed in WWII especially the Pacific theater. A very cool book, would make a good movie!"
2,Too much whining.,Life's tough. Tougher for some than others. This author whines more than tells a compelling story. I'd pass on this if I were you.
3,Had a hard time connecting...,"I really wanted to like this book but I felt a certain disconnect to the emotions. It's almost as if Ms. Kehoe is a third party observer at times, yet at other times she's right in the moment of feeling the emotional/verbal/mental abuse. Many memoirs are powerful BECAUSE of the spare prose (especially holocaust memoirs written by people who were young at the time) but this feels like the reader is being kept at an arm's distance (not unlike how her father treated his family). I realize that NONE of the people in this story are all good or bad but there was an almost one-dimensional feeling to the sibs and Mom was either a saint or abusive in her own right for being a secret-keeper/peace-keeper at all costs."
1,"TERRIBLE Toy, Does Not Do What It Implies!!!","I purchased this toy on a whim while walking through Wal-Mart a couple weeks after Christmas. It was seriously marked down, I think I paid about $12 for it...it's not worth even that. This toy implies that by throwing the balls into the basket the head/basket area moves side to side, lights up, and sings...WRONG!!!The three balls are FAR too light to make the head move. You have to manually move it to make the nose light up, and it only plays one song over and over. You can't see in the stock photo they show, but there's a giant plastic tail in the back of this toy that makes storing it extremely akward...it takes up much more space then you may thing. Overall, I say PASS. Spend the money you'd use on this piece of junk, and buy something that does what it says it will do!"
3,good toy,my nephew is 2 yrs old and loves to play with it-thought i've been told it is hard to keep all the balls together.
2,Not what we expected,"It takes pretty much space and doesn't do much for my baby,but look nice.That's pretty much about it"
4,Only buy if you have other Kong stuff,"My friend got me the skull island playset for christmas and such i am such a kong fan i was really excited. I was surprised at all the detail of the island. Unfortunately alot of disapointment set in shortly. the shaky log bridge sucks. it really doesnt shake at all unless you detatch it from the set and shake it. The walls and such are really just decoration and do anything. The worst is that the 8 figures it comes with CANT STAND UP. a few can in certain spots but most of the time your just really frustrated with them trying to get them to stand. Plus this website says it comes with slugs, well it doesnt, nor does it come with kong himself.Soon I bought more figures though and once I had monsters and kong and everything the playset turned out pretty cool."
4,King Kong Skull Island playset,"My son loves his playset! He did, however, comment on the cardboard cut-out ground, and would have preferred a plastic base that would have allowed for real water to flow. This would also prevent from easy damage."
4,Patience is Golden,i think it is a great toy but the price ther are asking for it is a little extreme building the toy is a little hard you got to give it time and you have a great toy. it has pretty good detail you can be a little rough with it i hope this was helpful from a kid point of view
2,WHAT?!!!,"Ok,now this carrying case.....CAN BARELY FIT ANYTHING IN IT!! I mean it can only fit my system,one controller the tv adapter I have,the power cord thing,and one game.Then,I have another controller and 4 more games sitting out.Well....the case can also fit 2-4 memory cards but they need to (nearly) be sqeezed in.Maybe if it was cheaper it would be a good deal...I really gave it 2 and a half stars."
3,Too small,"It's just a little too small. You can stuff 1 controller on the side and then stuff the power supply on the other side. In the front pocket you can squeeze in 2 games. (Notice I am using words like stuff and squeeze). I am going to try the backpack next since I have 4 contollers. Hopefully it has a little more room. Currently I have no way to pack my 5"" monitor. I can say that it is made very well and is quite durable!"
4,IT CAN'T hold much At all,I got this case in am starter pack i'm very dissiapointed ihave 3 controllers i can fir the GC the controllers the RF switch and the 2 games i can barley fit that stuff in i have to hold the power pack i thought this would be good its not
2,Its ok,"Its good for holding you system, but what about the games. I can only get one game in there. I would buy a bigger case if I were you."
2,doesn't work so far,I've taken it for a good 2-3 weeks and it hasn't had any affect on me no matter which way i try to take it.
3,Product seal protection issue?,"Got the product(ON creation 2000G) yesterday and cant wait to try it out. But when I open the amazon box I could see the powder around the cap already, when I open it there is no seal protection in which most of ON product has. So is this normal for their creatine item? I need feedback before using it!"
4,Seems to be working,"I'm not a hardcore lifter by any means but I was planning to get back into weightlifting and was looking for some help to show some improvement in the short term so I stuck with going to the gym regularly. The Creatine seems to be working and I've definitely noticed added muscle in the 3-4 weeks I've been using the product. It does dissolve easily into cereal milk, yogurt, protein shakes, etc."
2,Not as much as promised,"I've been heavy lifting for more then 5 month's i've lifted before but i take some breaks in period's of time but i used this product before every workout like it said, but i got no extra reps at all, not to many results. The price is right but maybe i didn't do it right ill still try more but i expected bigger results :("
1,It tastes bitter like medicine..,"Hey Guys,Be careful while purchasing this product. This product tastes bitter like medicine tablet. I have purchased other product of Optimum Nutrition so thought this will be good too but very disappointed after drinking it first time."
3,Seems to work,"Seems to work well and do what is intended. Supposed to add to protein mixes to help with muscle tears, seems to be fine."
2,Did not work for me.,I would have givein it a 1 star but i didnt because i didnt get the side effects some people mentioned. I did not get any result not even strength nor muscle gains. Maybe my huge diet is all i need. I eat at least 5000 calories - 300+ grams of protein and about 500 - 600 grams of carbs. I weigh 295 lbs and lean. I did not get water rentention nor any size increase. i took 5g per day for 2 months. maybe monos dont work for my body or i already eat enough. I will try another creatine this time a combination blend and not mono.
4,Good?,"It is flavorless but it's just a bit difficult to mix and get all the chunks at the bottom dissolved. To be honest, I don't feel anything from taking it. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. No adverse effects but hopefully it's making me healthier or something."
5,No Calories,Gives me my creatine I need and has absolutely no flavor. I mix it in with my protein drink and get both done in one shot.
3,It's cool...,"I've used this creatine a few times but I think I'm hooked on Con-Crete right now. By all means, this creatine is great but I recommend Con-Crete for anyone looking."
4,No taste.,No taste and mixes well with every drink I've tried. I would buy again. Comes in a jar the size of a large vitamin jar.
5,Solid Great Item,"Honestly Great product, it works, I saw my reps increase as well as my strength when i took this pre workout, has 0 taste."
4,Simple,"Great product, mixes well. I usually combine with protein powder and I never notice the chalky taste that most creatine has. Will continue to use."
4,Confused?,"I dont understand why there are 2 2,000g options and why the 4000g is worth almost 4 times more the 2000g pack?"
5,The Best,"This stuff is the best stuff on the market. It's cheap, dissolves amazingly well, and it's tasteless. The important thing is that it's pure creatine."
4,Does the job well,"This is my first time taking creatine so I was a bit cautious in buying. This product is tasteless as described. It does not mix perfectly if stirred in a glass, but mixes well enough to be swallowed without any trouble. I experienced a minor bloat the first few days but not anymore. At 5g a day in the maintenance phase the bottle will last a while. I have seen my weights go up as well as my muscle endurance and I would definitely recommend this brand."
4,Doesn't Mix Well - Still Recommended,"Just started using this product and am still on the loading phase, but I've noticed that it *DOES NOT* mix very well - in spite of the description. I've tried both water and juice and am having a lot of trouble choking it down.Still recommended, just a caveat."
3,"It was good, but didn't mix well",The product was alright it works good if you take it at the right time. The problem is it doesn't mix very well.I t sinks to the bottom...7/10
5,Amazing Supplement!,"I lifted weights for eight straight years (four with a college football program) and recently got back into it after a three year break. Almost that entire time I tried whey protein powders and never really felt anything but terrible indigestion. I studied up and decided to try creatine. It works. I was already starting to plateau and creatine immediately pushed me through. As for this product, it is mostly flavorless and dissolves easily. I also recommend it because it is GMP certified. Very satisfied!"
4,Alright I suppose,"The powder itself doesn't taste like much which makes it extremely easy to hide the taste. As for see results, I have to say o haven't but it could very well be because of my own workout routine. I do recommend this product if you have a set workout and the dedication for it ."
5,Excelent product !!!,Is the best isolate creatine I've ever had in 22 years working out. See the results in just a few weeks.
2,seems fine; but NO SCOOP,"It does not come with scoop!! so measuring the exact grams is impossible if you don't have a gram scale... first day i had to go to the restroom a lot because I took a lot without knowing. Even now the ambiguity is annoying. I'll either take too little or too much. Grams depend on what substance is so a gram of sugar, protein, and createin will not have the same volume (tea spoon size) so you HAVE to have a gram scale to correctly measure it. Other supplements DO include their own scoop and tell you how much gram it holds and they make a full scoop to evenly divide into the amount you need per day. So if you need 10grams of something, the scoop has volume to have 10grams or 5grams, so you know how many scoops you need. this has been very upsetting. In weight training the amount of supplement is everything!"
4,Technical Review,"I'll keep it short and sweet (mostly technical stuff).Pros:-A lot of bang for the buck, this bottle will last you for a while.Cons:-It might depend on the solvent, but I find that, especially with water and/or milk, the creatine doesn't fully dissolve, and a lot of it sits at the bottom of the bottle from which I'm drinking. I've had to fill my shaker bottle back up 2-3 times just to get all the creatine residue that didn't dissolve the first time around.-In this case, it can be pretty easy to waste some creatine, so make sure you can dissolve as much as possible-Make sure people don't think it's cocaine."
4,Excellent Product,"I was skeptical of buying Creatine as some of my friends told me that it will affect sexual hormones. I contacted many physical trainers including Tom Venuto. They told me that nothing of that sort has been proven till now and I can trust this product. Then I checked for the best Creatine available and found this product. This is made from Creapure and is micronized. I feel really energetic after I started using this product. It is unflavored and has no odor. I will definitely recommend this product to any young man who is trying to get stronger. Only problem is that, (it may be only my case) I feel drowsy early at night even though I am more energetic in the day time."
4,NO reason not to buy it.,"Its creatine and its flavorless. The quantity is good for the price. If you want creatine, buy this. Why not buy something else? Besides price i really dont have any reason to offer you; its all pretty much the same. I can say i appreciate the subtle label on the container. It doesnt have some obnoxiously overzealous name with a very imposing color scheme. Its simple, its direct, its creatine."
4,First time user,"I do think this product works i did see gains in size, but its the most nasty crap i have ever put down my throat, it tastes so horrible it made me gag almost every time i would drink it, it was so bad it would give me goose bumps after i swallowed it. BUT!! it did do what it was suppost to do"
4,Great without the bloating!,"I've taken 2 different brands of creatine powder since I initially worked out and 1 of the 2 always left me feeling bloated. This 1 certainly didn't cause ANY bloating and for that I am VERY pleased! My workouts are longer because of the additional boost of energy and as such, the results are packing on. I usually go with Twin Lab products but I would recommend this brand to anyone just as much as I would Twin Lab."
5,Good pure creatine,"Optimum Nutrition's creatine is probably one of the best and well known creatine powders on the market. It's micronized so it's more mixable and is Creapure, which is supposed to be the purest you can find. It's fairly cheap, though you can find creatine for much cheaper from different brands, but you're paying for the quality with this. Highly recommended for anyone of any age as it's not only a body building supplement like previously thought."
3,This product does NOT mix,"I have to drink it in my protein shake otherwise it all settles at the bottom. If you are looking for something you can mix with fruit juice, this isn't it. I can't speak to the quality of the product as i haven't used it for long enough yet."
5,There are cheaper,"Althought there are cheaper options i like the ON brand, i have used most of there products and are made with quality"
4,Good Creatine,I mixed this up with my ON Whey Protein and happy with the results. It does at slight bit of texture to the mix but its disregardable.
4,Great,I take it every day after a work out with my soy protein shake... already see results after a few weeks :)
4,"Very good product. It really is tasteless but doesn't really ""dissolve"" in water.","Great product but doesn't really ""dissolve"" in water. It will mix but seems to seperate and eventually wind up at the bottom of the glass. I sprinkle it on food to do the job or just keep mixing while drinking it with a glass of water. Not really a big deal for the results it gives."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"first time using creatine, just finishing up my loading process. Noticeble difference within the first couple of days on my overall dexterity. One issue I have, and It might just be due to the first week of complete muscle saturation- but I have been getting an ear ache/ slight jaw pain on the left side. If anyone else is experiencing this, feel free to let me know if I'm doing something wrong.For the price, and expectation- I'm satisfied"
3,Good and cheap.,Very good and cheap creatine. But lost a star because it doesnt mix well at all with water never tried it with juice because i heard thats a wise tale.
4,Gets the job done,"It doesnt dissolve the greatest at all so you have to constantly mix or shake it up, but its almost tastesless and it works!"
5,Great,It really does work with no side effects it just gives you so much energy and builds muscle very fast
1,Does not disolve,"I bought this from Amazon a month ago, I have used many brands of Creatine before first time with this company. I have tried to mix this with every type of juice or water and it just floats to the bottom. I wrote to the company and they said they'll get back to me in ""8 WEEKS! "" I told them yeah I'll just put my workout on hold untill you get this issue of your product possibly pooling up in my kidneys like it does in my glass."
1,Terrible side effects,"I had used creatine 3 times before, and my body harshly reacted to one one of them. I can't remember the name, but similar symptoms appeared when I used this product for 10 days. I bought this product because of the good average review, I am 105 kg, but i used a lower dose than the recommended amount. The product can't be returned (I see the reason). I have to wait 1 month, then will shift to another brand. Avoid this product, if you care about your kidney."
1,The worst product ever...! Waste of money,This product is waste of money & time. I made me sick. I was going to the bathroom back & forth for a day. I throw the rest in the trash. I am going back to my regular Creatine.
2,Im looking for a new product.,"Despite what others say it doesn't mix well (even in a protein shake), you can taste it in your drink, and its a hassle to use. I am going to invest in pills so I do not have to carry a spoon everywhere I go. But its cheap! If you cant afford anything else."
5,Its the Creapure - RAW and UNCUT!,"This stuff is the bomb-dig-aty!.... The only down fall its that its pricy compared to other creapure. Oh well it comes from a good brand rather some no name brand that probably stepped on it...Take this stuff after loading twice a day, one after work out and then another after dinner. Drink a grip of water with this stuff. Work out 3 times a week with cardio in between and I can notice my arms are a lot tighter and firmer. Good stuff!!! It you want to increase gains throw in some ISO-100 post work out and some 100% Whey Gold Standard with the creapure!"
5,my review,"For anybody that is in a budget, this is a good creatine product to get. Since it is flavorless, I just put a spoon of it in my mouth and wash it down with a gatorade mix I got at walmart. Don't have to worry about wasting creatine when mixing in a glass. There's 400 serving of 5g of creatine so it's going to be a while until I get another bottle.only negative I can think of, It doesn't come with a measuring spoon. It say spoonful on the label, but it can mean anything. I got like 10 different spoon size in my kitchen. I have no idea how much is 5 grams."
4,Not quite so tasteless,"This creatine is great, but it's not quite up to amazon's hype. Why? Because it's supposed to be tasteless/odorless, and a better description would be mild taste/wierd odor. In water, it stays relatively suspended, but has a gritty feel to it. It's much, much better mixed into your protein drink/shake. You can't even tell that it's in it that way!As far as potency and such, a powder is a great way to go b/c you can monitor your dosages very easily.Overall, it worked well for me, and I would buy it again."
3,It was okay,"Great product, Okay price, thats why i said 3 stars. I like ON stuff so i got it, but its basically the same as the lesser priced, lesser well known brands. Prob would buy again if it was on sale."
3,couldn't get it to blend at all,My only complaint it I couldn't get this stuff to blend into anything. It would always just gather at the bottom of the glass. I wound up just take it with a teaspoon then drinking a glass of water. It did disolve alright in my mouth and literally had no taste at all.
3,Creatine,"As rumored yes it is tasteless, however a little bit gritty when you mix it by itself, but for me i add a teaspoon with ON whey protein and i cant even taste the grittiness. As far as the bloating that people are worried about, for me i have noticed a couple more pounds on the scale while using this product. I dont know if its directly due to the fact im using creatine or what, however i dont feel bloated. My reason for buying this product as well as everyone else out there was to get some extra reps out of my sets. and i have notice a difference with certain muscle groups but not all. For example i noticed i cant do a couple more reps with chest and shoulder exercises, but my biceps and triceps remain for the most part the same. Only had a couple weeks with this product, maybe a further evaluation down the road. Only 3 stars due to not noticing a full improvement on all body parts."
2,nutricion,"no tengo el producto por un tema de permiso para viajar al peru. no puedo evaluarlo, no calificar el producto"
2,no es el tamaño,lamentablemente el tamaño no fue el que pedí. aparte de que llego muy tarde y pues pague la novatada por algo que pensé seria bueno.
2,Didn't really see any gains,Didn't really see any gains but did give me a headache on loading phase. Not sure why it didn't help
2,bad reaction,I tried this product but it gave me a bad reaction. It gave me the feeling like someone punched me in the midsection. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Good creatine,"Not much to say, this is included within my morning supplemental mix. Have seen gains and reduced down time from taking this stuff."
5,Great stuff.,I have used different types of creatine and for the price you can't beat this product. In was in great condition and I received it SUPER fast. Great product.
3,Only good with grape juice,This is older outdated creatine. Works ok when used with a grape juice because of it's high sugar content which help transport the creatine into the muscle cells.
4,"Eh, did what was advertised","ON Creatine does what it's advertised. Just be sure to mix in WARM or HOT water and not with your protein shake if you want the best solubility. There also might be this bitter, gritty taste when drinking with water so look out for that."
4,Great creatine!,This is a great creatine product! The only two minor things I would change would be that it doesn't stay mixed very well (no creatine does) and it doesn't come with a scoop for measuring.
2,Too many pieces and hard to set up,"This game looked like a lot of fun when we saw it in the store, but I agree with other reviewers that it is way more trouble than it is worth. It takes a long time to set up and if you don't get it set up just right, some of the bees fall through. This is not a game a young child (4 year old) can play independently. In addition, there are so many pieces to lose and with a younger child (17 months) and 2 dogs, it seems like a losing battle to chase all the pieces through the house."
3,Too much trouble to set up,Takes forever to stick to the leaves into the tree and some of them don't go in very easily. Once we were set up and ready to play my 4 year old loved this game but the other problem is the game only lasts about 5 minutes and of course they want to play again and then it takes more than 5 minutes to set it up again.
2,Will find another use for the bees!,"The other reviewers are correct...this game takes far too long to set up and a child simply loses interest because of the long wait in between games. Not only that, but for each player, the tree trunk has to be twisted to a different slot. Unfortunately, the twisting action is HARD on the wrist and is definitely too hard for a five year old to move."
3,Fun for Little Ones,"One of my grandchildren is 3 and she gets tired of not being able to play some of the more complicated games. We gave her this game for Christmas and she was thrilled to have a game all her own. True, as other reviews point out, some of the bees fall and it does take time to set it up--but we laugh as much setting it up as we do playing it so it is time well spent."
1,"5 Seconds of Play, 5 Minutes of set up",Takes forever to set up and the game is over after a few moves. Kids get bored waiting for you set it up and then don't want to play anymore because it takes too long between actual play.
3,Looks more fun on the box!,"We've only played with this game twice....my son lost interest that quickly! It's a cute game and he loves playing with the bees and leaves outside of the game. However, the game itself takes too long to put the leaves into the holes and can become quite cumbersome once you have several in. My 5 year old cannot put them in alone. It's cute but not something that we'll play with again and again the way it's intended."
2,Set-up is longer than the game itself,"I saw this at my son's day care and thought it would be a great way to pass time out our house. It is definitely a way for *me* to pass time, trying to get those stupid leaves put in for twenty minutes. The game itself takes about three minutes to play. Though my three year-old son loves the game, until he's old enough to put in the leaves himself, I've hidden this away."
2,Royal pain to set up,"This game is inexpensive and looks cute, but it is a ROYAL PAIN to play b/c it takes forever to stick each of the sticks into the holes -- it gets more difficult the more are in there, and no child will have the patience to set it up all for the few minutes of ""play"" to get the bees."
5,Great game,Honey Bee Tree Game a wonderful game and lots of fun my 2year old plays it and she loves it hours of fun.
3,"Cute, but Tedious","This is a really cute game with really cute, durable pieces. I love the look of the bees and the leaves. Setting up the game by sticking the leaves in and out of holes takes about 5 minutes. Playing the game takes 1-2 minutes if you just pull out the leaves. It can take 5 minutes to play if the players try to figure out which leaf to pull without dropping any bees and turning the hive slowly to the next player. My kids like to play if I set up the games. They like to help stick in a few leaves, but most of the tedious set up falls on me. This is a game that might be pulled out once in a while for a short diversion."
4,My 3 year loves this game,"This game is a pain to set up but my 3 year old likes to play it, and I wanted a game we could play together. It's educational for little ones because they get a chance to count all their bees at the end to see who has the least amount, though my daughter actually loves losing because she wants more bees!"
2,"So Adorable, But...","Yes, this game is incredibly cute. I agree wholeheartedly that it takes way too much time to set up. By the time we get the leaves in the tree (which is no small feat - you must put insert the leaves pretty much in a specific order to get them all to fit) our 4 yr old son is bored and ready to play something else. In the few times I've been able to drag him back to the game, it takes just a few pulls on a few leaves to make the bees drop. If he happens to bump the tree - ALL the bees can fall in to the open area and fall through at once. It makes for a very irritating experience, especially for mommy! Yes, its really, really cute - but I can't say I am thrilled with the purchase. Our siamese cat has had more fun batting the bees around the tile floor...(Under our supervision, of course! Those bees are pretty small and could get lodged in his little throat!) There are definitely better games out there..."
2,Perhaps for little kids (under 3?),"My 4 year old got this game from his aunt. We have tried many times to play it, since it looks cute. But each time, we pack it back up in under five minutes. It actually takes longer for us to pack it up (or to set it up) than to play it. The long-stemmed leaves, which are supposed to be inserted through the holes in the top of the ""tree"" have to be inserted one by one by an adult. And the bees, which are supposed to be held up by the stems, keep falling through and onto the collection cup before the game even begins. We are not very satisfied with it."
4,It's not as tough to set up as you'd think...,"It took several tries before I realized the ""trick"" to setting this game up more quickly. The branches enter one side of the hive and exit through a hole on the other side. At first, I found it frustrating to get all of the leaves through the exit holes. Then I realized that once you've inserted a dozen leaves or so, the rest don't have to exit. Then can just be popped in quickly and find support on the properly inserted brances.I didn't think the directions were as clear as they should have been. I definitley fell prey to the ""award winning"" sticker on the box when I bought this game.However, the more we play it, the more I see the educational value in it. My 3 year old is simply thrilled to learn turn-taking as we try to make the bees fall out. My 7 and 9 year olds are definitely more into the logic and competition of the game.All told, once you've mastered the branch issue, it's really a fun game and worth the space on your family game shelves!"
2,Not worth the effort,"It takes too long to set up (sticking all the leaves through the hive). By the time I'm done, the kids have lost interest. They had more fun just playing with the bees separately."
4,Honey Bee Tree,"Our 6 yr old received this for Christmas. It takes a bit of time to set up, but worth the effort. I found that it's much easier if you follow the slant of the holes (which seems to guide you to another hole). Our 4 year old also enjoyed playing the game and surprised us with her ability to pull out the sticks ever so carefully! Each time the bees started to fall the kids would squeal and we would all start laughing. I feel the game encourages critical thinking and improves fine motor skills. Kids get to see what happens when a stick is chosen quickly vs a carefully selected stick. Bees could be a choking hazard if you have kids that frequently put things in their mouth. I would recommend that this game be purchased for 4 - 7 year olds as it may be to basic for an older child."
3,not for the recomended age,"Pretty much this game is just like the game 'ker-plunk'. You put in the little poles to hold the marbles up and pull them out one at a time without letting the marbels (bees in this case) fall through. They just dressed it up a bit to make it more appealing to younger kids. They would probably like the bees falling out, but not the settup and wouldnt understand to ""game part"" or strategy. My opinion, get it for an older child (7 or up), since they will be able to set it up and understand it on thier own. Or if they wont like the tree and honey design, go with Ker-Plunk. I think that is on here too!"
3,Too long to set up,"Great idea and a very cute looking game, but as many other reviewers have pointed out, it takes way too long to set up. Plus you have dozens of pieces that will inevitably get lost, broken, or misplaced. Not worth it."
3,Great Concept & loved by preschoolers but time consuming to set up.,"We admit that games like this are really fun for our pre-schoolers...especially the ones who aren't quite up to the cognitive devices of ""advanced"" games like Candy Land, etc. Sure, this is hands on fun, but it takes longer to set it up than to play the game--loosing the attention, at times, of our little ones. Our 2 yo girl loves just holding the bees which, of course, are a choking hazzard and could easily be swallowed w/o supervision. Would definitely adhere to the over 3 warning/suggestion.Concept 5 stars and quality 5 stars, but gave it 3 stars b/c we ""dread"" when the children ask to play due to set up. Still, for the price, if you are considering it, it would be worth it."
3,Looked cute,This looked like such a cute game but I had no idea what a pain it would be to set up. It takes FOREVER to get all the little sticks in and then once you are done some of the bees fall through when you put them in. Once you have that done it is fun to play but not worth setting up over and over again. This game just sits in the corner of my daughters room collecting dust...
2,Cute But Frustrating,"Takes longer to assemble than play. We've only played it a couple of times, but my 3 and 4 year old don't yet get the strategy. The trays are a little too small and bees tend to bounce out. It's not bad for a quick game, but call the kids in after you've set it up."
2,Please! Not again!,"We purchased this game for our son when he was about 3 & 1/2 years old. He loved it! He wanted to play it repeatedly. The only problem is, the set up each time is quite tedious and takes three times as long as it does to actually play the game. Since he was too little to set it up, guess who got to do it over and over and over? We conveniently lost this game when we moved."
3,Cute game,"My 7 year old wanted this for Christmas. It's a cute game, but it's very hard to get all the leaves in the tree. They tend to get too crowded. But once they are in, the kids love the game. Good for any age."
1,It's very cute but....,"... play value is low. It takes forEVER to set it up and, IMHO, requires adult hands. The holes for the leafs are small and after the first few are inserted, it gets to be quite a challenge. Once set up, it offers less than 5 minutes of play. About the only really good thing about it is that the 2yo loves the noise the bees make as she pours them ""through"" the tree - who needs leaves? The 6yo, however, loses interest pretty quickly. I don't recommend this toy."
2,Hide this one in the back of the closet!,"This game looks fun and it's a great concept but not worth it.The set up takes way too long, getting the sticks in is very tricky and there is no way a little kid could do it on their own. My little girl is off playing in the other room before I can even finish setting up. The tree is difficult to turn to each players space and toward the end of the game bees come falling out just by turning the trunk. It is a very quick game (2-3 minutes) to play which might be good for kids with a short attention span but terrible for the adult because then the torturous task of setting up begins.I would have given this one star if my daughter didn't have fun during the actual playing of the game."
1,Designed to Kill Parents,"This was one of my bigger mistakes. The leaves are hard to get in. There are maybe 100000000 bees and you will be finding them in the strangest places. I didn't really understand the purpose of this game after buying it. The kids liked it but unfortunately for them, it accidentally go dropped in the garbage can (mean I know). Tough toy."
1,Honey Bee Tree,"Bought this game for my almost 3 year old grandson and it is way out of his attention span. Too many little parts and not interesting enough for his level. So it when straight to storage hopefully when he is older.It's almost like 'pick up Sticks"" only using a tree. At his age they don't get that concept and who has the small motor cordination until much older say 12/13 year olds."
2,Spill and Food Catcher,This bib catches food and juice in the plastic compartment at the bottom of the bib it's very colorful which all kids and parents love but its not thick and absorbent enough in my opinion once it gets wet you have to get another bib because no child likes something cold and wet on them.Of course all bibs need to be changed after a while but not soon as your child spits up or makes a mess. I would stick with this bib if it was a little thicker because the colors are great and the designs are exciting on the eye.
4,Great Bibs - Easy to Clean,"These bibs are great especially for those that are ready to eat solid foods. They wash very easily, either by hand or thrown in the washer and dry quickly. They're much better than the cotton or polyester ones and a step above disposable. My son was pulling the disposable ones off, but these stay on much better."
2,Dont waste your Money! Way overpriced for what you get!,"I agree with the other review, I had to help my son with this toy every time he used it. The figures do not fit on there stands and it was too hard for my 6 year old to tighten them up each time... He had more fun with just the figures and smashing them into each other..."
4,Good case,"UH, I have this and I was able to fit, 2 controllers (regular), dvd kit + remote, 2 AV cables, 1 AC, the xbox, 4+ games, manuals.Good carrying case well designed with a nice look to it."
3,nice system case but......,Nice case with a comfortable carrying strap. (well needed as the Xbox is heavy)Nice accessory pocket for AV and power cables but.....Space only for two controllers or 4 games in cases..... not both
2,just ok,"The idea of a padded carrying case is a good idea. This particular carrying case is not big enoughto hold the gear. It is narrow with little or no room for the xbox, controller, playback kit, and plugs. The advantages is that it has buckles, zippers, and arm-strap to secure the items that are being carried. Needs improvement on space."
2,Not enough room for stuff,"This carrying case is not what you think it is...I try to fit all my stuff in it but i can only stuff in my system, games, adapter, and dvd kit. no room for controllers. i sugesst you save your money and buy a more better carrying case. it is not worth your money. i get so fursturated!"
4,Great if taking Xbox with you everywhere,"This Xbox System carrying case is great for those of us who take their Xbox with them a lot. I love it. It carries the system, 2 controllers, all cables, plus some games and magazines."
2,too much for too little,"This carrying case isn't an awful case for the Xbox, but if you have any amount of controllers or games, it's way too small. Personally, my adidas bag serves the purpose of this product much more efficiently."
4,A good solution to lugging your XBox around,"The carring case is very conveinient for taking my Xbox places. The case is just the right size that it will hold everying I need when packed right(xbox + wires, 2 s-controllers, 9 xbox games w/ cases and a dvd playback kit) yet everything will fit nice and snug so things won't move around. Also the colour and design match the Xbox nicely. The straps and handle are sturdy and comfortabe. The carring case is well padded so there is no worrys there. The downside is that the case is a little pricy though. Altoger I like everything about it ecept its price."
2,More like a marketing manual,I was hoping for a more 'interesting' read. I did learn a few interesting secrets but this book was more of an 'advisement' to companies on how to market their brand.
5,Incredibly Exciting Read,"Breaking into existing markets is never easy. It takes guts and determination, and often that still is not enough. With potential client's attention to standard marketing techniques dwindling in a sea of alternatives, and with budgets becoming increasingly competitive in our line of business, it is essential to find a new edge. Martin's book not only points us in the right direction, it gives us a cornucopia of examples for brainstorm fodder. One of the most exciting business reads of my lifetime. Highly entertaining and highly recommended.Marc GimbrereDirectorLight Web Dynamic Webs Systems, Australia"
2,"Warning, the author likes hype","I was considering reading this book, as it had come up as part of a work discussion. I went to the website brandsense dot com to find out more and on the promotional materials there's a blurb about the author where in the opening sentence it claims ""Martin Lindstrom founded his own advertising agency at the age of 12""!!! Now, forgive me, but I find this extremely hard to believe unless he is really stretching the definition. And even if it is true, do you really want one of the first things someone reads about your brand (ie: Martin in this instance) to be something that makes you think ""what a joke, this guy is obviously full of hype""?!!? Now, maybe the book is OK, certainly a lot of other people think it is, but I fear that this sets the tone."
2,Interesting at times,"This book raises some very interesting case points about sensory involvement with brand, and makes a compelling argument that most companies are leaving many senses on the table when it comes to brand establishment. It gives some good, concrete examples of where Microsoft has made mistakes, and where Apple and Singapore Airlines have gotten it right.The reason for my low review isn't because the book lacks interesting material. It is because the book is overly wordy, and would have been far better condensed to 20% of its size. If it brought in more case examples, and were a lot shorter, it would have conveyed its ideas in an efficient fashion. Instead, it the amount of ideas and value per hour of reading became much too low."
5,Very powerful!!!,"Very powerful saw. Small and compact. Wish it came with a carrying case at this price, but it was worth every penny!"
2,Didn't work well for us,"Unfortunately, this product didn't work as well for us as we expected. It made my son very hyper and aggressive, and it didn't reduce his allergy symptoms enough to be worth the hyperactivity side effect. It did reduce his symptoms to a small extent, and he didn't mind the flavor, so I'm not giving it the lowest amount of stars.This said, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that every child is different. The fact that it didn't work for my son doesn't mean it won't work for *any* child. If you've just found out your child has allergies, it may be a trial-and-error thing for a while finding the perfect medicine. I don't believe this is in and of itself a bad medicine, just that it didn't work for us."
3,Not so great for audiobooks,"I use portable CD players mostly to listen to audiobooks. Having gone through two Sony players in about three years, I wanted something that would be (hopefully) a little more durable. Anyway, I decided on this one. The sound is fine, but unlike the Sony players that I have had, this player does not remember where you left off when you turn off the CD, but always starts over at track 1. This means I spend a lot of time skimming through the tracks, trying to remember where I was before I turned it off. That seriously bugs me. Also, the volume automatically resets itself at level four when you put in a new CD or turn off the player, which also annoys me. All in all, it's a good little player (and it's blue!), but it's not so great for audiobooks."
4,A kid's review,"I got this CD player for my birthday. It worked great, but it had a little trouble with the tracks. I had it for 1 and a half years before it finally died. It has held up through being dropped by all my three siblings, being left out in the rain and being dropped numerous times by me. It's very durable."
1,"Didn't work, tried 4 cds; played fine on another brand, didn't play on this one.","I tried this cd player, to replace a prior model, which was refurbished and worked great, but wore out. I tried four cds, including one that played fine on a car stereo. There was only one that worked. I tried the same four cds on a Sony model, and they played fine. There were no scratches or defects in the cds. I am in the process of contacting the manufacturer. I'm very disappointed with this and will not buy RCA again. I will say that the seller (Uncle Joe's) was great. It's a shame they got a bad product (the manufacturer is at fault). Also, the front display makes it hard to see the progress of the track, etc.. Good luck with anyone buying it but you've been warned."
1,This RCA CD player sucks.,"In short it is a ""try to be hi-tech"" light-wieght piece of plastic that does not play a cd. Please don't waste your $. If I had saved the box (just assumed at it's cost it would work) I could have returned it. Anyway it is in recycled trash."
1,so frustrating does not work at all,"I bought this item through amazon to listen to books while I walk. It will not play at all, and it is time consuming and tedious to return anything to amazon. They will not take back the carrying case which I purchased . It has to be returned to the manufacturer! What a total waste of an otherwise lovely day.I will not be purchasing electronics from amazon again."
4,"Not obsolete, and pretty decent little machine",I work in a place where using the company owned equipment for personal things like playing music is forbidden as is bringing in flash cards or mp3 devices. Not many of these are still available with the advent of mp3 technology and cheap usb flash cards and such that could facilitate thievery. So to follow the rules I got this and brought in my old cheap radio shack speakers and one of those universal power adapters that I haven't been able to make work for anything until now. It works with negative polarity and set to 4.5 volts dc so that takes care of power (I'm allowed to use their power). The sound that is coming out of these old computer speakers is great and I can adjust the volume enough that I can still converse with people. Not as cheap as the Coby model which is rated as the best of these things other places but I'm happy.
1,Terrible,"This CD player would not play a brand new, scratch free, legit bought store audio cd. It will also not even read any home made CDRs. Do not buy."
3,RCA Personal CD player,"This product is okay for the price, however cannot get enough volume and the LCD feature doesn't work....Would cost me more to return it so will deal with it.."
5,Great sound,"Has great sound and so far it is reliable. The buttons are hard to read, so it takes getting used to knowing where everything is located. There is no clip to carry it so I have to keep it in my pocket when I'm working or walking. still, it is a nice rig, I like it."
5,The Crystal Staff Trilogy Book One: The Song of Steel,This book was amazing from the start. From when Ser Larkel and Bigsby Littlefoot where fighting I was trying to figure out who was the bad guy. Most books that have any type of fighting in the beginning usually has one of the fighters are evil or bad. I had to read on thru the we hours and still couldn't find any bad person in it. I finally decided that Hemlock was the bad guy and I am still not too sure of that. Can't wait for the next book to come out. This book was great kept you wanting to read more and the more you read the more exciting the book became.
2,A book full of fantasy cliches,"This book left me distinctly unimpressed and with no interest in reading more of this series. The characters are flat, it's hard to feel a real lot of empathy for them - and most of them seem rooted in fantasy cliches of Brownies, Elves and nasty humans.This book reads like it was written for young teenagers and not adults, so be warned."
1,Huh?,I may be only 12 but I know a terrible book when I read it. this is nowhere near 5 stars. Crystal Staff reads like a cartoon not good cartoon like manga but junk my baby brother watches. Read anything else not this awful terible horible book.
4,Essentials of Nursing Leadership and Management,"Good basic textbook for nursing students, education of new nurses, and/or persons who have recently been promoted to a leadership position without previous leadership experience."
4,useful material,This book was a requirement for my nursing issues and trends course. The book itself was basic stuff that we as nurses already know. What was good about the book was that it took what we know and showed us how to apply it to everyday situations.
1,Something wrong here!,I ordered this dvd twice and both times recieved region 2 dvds that wouldn't play in my machine here in the USA. This item is advertised region one but I guess they send anything they have on hand. Plus I paid $36.00 each for the two I ordered which I returned immdiately. Why would amazon.com ship region 2 dvds to people in the USA? Who knows but the item is advertised as region one. Has anyone out there had a similar experience with this dvd?
1,Live at Cardiff Castle,This has nothing to do with Tom Jones. The DVD is not made for playing in the U.S. The DVD and Decoder on the computer cannot read the DVD.
5,All that and a bag of chips.,The first time I saw this was on A&E and I was just watching it on a regular t.v. and the sound was incredible. As I write this review I'm watching the DVD and it is the most incredible DVD I have ever seen. The fidelity is outstanding. I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.
5,Tom Jones - Live at Cardiff Castle,"I was more than pleasantly surprised with this DVD. Tom Jonesstill has it! His voice is powerful, and he is accompanied by his terrific band of super-talented musicians. He's a perfectionist and this proves it. I can only say if you area Tom Jones fan, you will absolutely not be disappointed withthis DVD. I am overwhelmed by it. Wow!"
1,"A+ for music, F for editing",The obnoxious editing is more in line with a music video than a concert. The quick cuts are an assault on your senses and your left with a headache at the end. Stupid. The senseless editing showcases the event more than it does the star. Tom Jones is very good if you can hang in there.
1,What's the hold up?,America cannot buy this if it is not available in our DVD format. Tom or someone is losing dollars because of it and fans are losing out on a what i hear is a great live show...if and when we'll never know.
1,Do you like camera changes at every 3 seconds?,"Do you like camera changes at every 3 seconds? That is what you are going to have with this DVD. Great performances, many hits, excellent musicians and Tom in top form. But these endless camera moves are pointless and make me feel dizzy, especially with a large screen. Impossible to follow a musician or Tom himself because the point of view is always changing. It must be fun for the editor to change angles at all the times, but that person must be the only one to enjoy it ! Too bad this editing style has now become fashionable. I cannot stand it more than 3 minutes, and here you get it for two hours."
4,Audio and region description,"Just be careful when purchasing this DVD. It is region 1 (not region 2 as described by Amazon). In addition, it only has pcm stereo audio (not dts or digital 5.1 as described by Amazon). The audio menu does have dts and 5.1 output options but they do not work."
1,Tom Jones: Live at Cardiff Castle,the advertisement for this dvd when I ordered it stated Region 1. It is not formatted for Region 1 and thus cannot be played on my American DVD player-very disappointing-
2,Hooker's theology through Booty's eyes,"This book is written from the perspective of one of the great minds of the Episcopal church. No one living has written more about Hooker than Booty. Booty attempts to integrate modernist thought (neo-orthodoxy?) with Hooker's worldview. I think his effort falls short. In all fairness the book is entitled ""Reflections..."" In reality, Booty holds a mirror up to the theology of Hooker and finds his own (Booty's) image.This is a must-have book for those who want the latest from Booty. The rest of us may want to check it out from our seminary library."
3,Serves the purpose.,This is very reasonably priced and looks like most MP3 players will fit in the storage compartment.
3,I was a bit disapointed,"First CD in this kit is OK, I prefer much more Bajofondo Tango Clubs first CD than this package. 2nd CD is more expirimental, I didn't find it very interesting. The 2 videos on the 2nd CD (you'll need the Quicktime player) are well done. Buy something else for techno-tango if you want to dance on this music."
1,.99 cent dvd and worth every penny,Terrible production. I was looking for just straight talk on wines here they wanted to have a drama.
3,alcohol permeates aftertaste,"While it does have a slight toffee taste, albeit extremely powerful (a few drops is all you will ever need) - to fully get the whole flavor you will undoubtedly get the alcohol aftertaste that comes with it."
2,Very essential guide actually,"Just received my copy of this book, amazon service was as good as usual, but the book... I'm afraid i'm quite dissapointed with it. Maybe I was wrong with my expectations, but the book is mostly a compilation of his film reviews and little more. I thought other info and a few pictures could be listed within an essential guide about him. That's all. Appart from that the book is well structured and has some funny points of view here and there."
5,"Melville, a commentator on a rising America","Not only did the Great short Works of Herman Melville offer some intelligent reading, but offered some insight into an emerging America. In this collections of Melville's masterpieces, one may find commentary on American's changing position and economy. A partiular example may be found in the story ""Bartleby, the Scrivner, the story of Wall Street."" Here, Melville shows how America's mind is turned toward wealth and starts to reject the traditional and religious ways of life once known to New York City.Not only does the story of Bartleby show Melville's ability to comment on a changing nation, but the other stories of the book carry a similar feel. Through its wonderful collection, the Great Short Works of Herman Melville captures the essence of Melville, the man."
4,A Scalp-Raiser!,"A classic western scenario! A stagecoach that must reach its final destination. Apaches on the warpath. One hero with a score to settle. A wise old sheriff, a trigger-happy deputy, a glory-hungry cavalry Lieutenant, and a host of other frontier types, all drawn to confrontation at a deserted stage station. But there's an added twist to this wonderful tale of Southwestern Arizona - an Apache scout by the name of Peaches, who is always more than he seems. His presence, plus a rapid-fire story line, makes ""Chiricahua"" an excellent read. Winner of the 1973 Spur Award for Historical Novel, ""Chiricahua"" is marred only by the use at times of excessive bad language. Otherwise, it would be worthy of 5 stars."
1,Where's the beef?,"I ordered two of these items on Dec 10, 2001. Despite repeated promises from Amazon.com customer service and advertising that states that this item ""usually ships in 24 hrs"" it has yet to ship. So don't disappoint your kids. If you want buy this product, go somewhere that has one to sell."
1,Listen to the pro.,"It is so horrible. It scatches my games, I can't get the zipper shut, and it is so forgetable. Just stick to the CD carrying cases, and you'll be fine! (Also sold by amazon, I think.)"
4,"Good, but lacking...","If nothing else, this is a winner because of the Xbox logo on it. Having read the previous reviews, I suppose the zipper can be difficult to use, but then some people still can't tie their shoes...It carries the games well and looks cool, but the little metal hook is slightly too big and the tiny pocket on the front is just that, tiny. I honestly don't know what you might put in there, but I guess it makes it look better.All together a descent buy if you don't have something to hold your games."
2,A CD/DVD case...nothing special,"Basically all this is is a small black Nylon CD case with the green XBOX logo and about a dozen vinyl CD sleeves to hold your game discs.I'm not a fan of these cases as it's very cramped on the interior and the vinyl sleeves do seem like they'll scratch your discs. The zipper is too big and bulky and there's nothing else here to get excited over. If you find yourself moving and travelling around a lot, I'd suggest finding a case with RIGID PLASTIC cd holder sleeves. This is fine, but overall, I just don't feel comfortable storing my XBOX game discs in it."
2,Xbox Carrying Case,Unless you really need to carry your xbox around a lot (!) I wouldn't get this. Some people are just getting anything for the xbox and don't even care what they are used for. The case looks cool and it would be cool to carry around (of course you may get jumped) it is not worth to buy.
1,Stiff Zipper,"The zipper on this LITTLE bag, which is basically a cordura CD holder is very hard to zip shut once it is open... Stay clear of this item if possible..."
1,Bad Idea,"The problem with this item is that somewhere along the line you still have to touch something to cover and uncover the seat. You have to put the darned thing on and then slide it off. Plus the fact of not being able to flush it down the toilet. I recomend Seaties instead as they are more like the seat covers you find in restaurants, etc. They don't cost much more than these and you can flush them down the toilet afterwards."
2,Kung Fu - The complete series,I have only reviewed two of the four discs so far. One disc has two bad spot in it. I would like to return it for replacement.
2,Kung Fu the complete series collection,"The quality of the DVD's is mediocre, specially Season One. Perhaps the series were too old to put into DVD's, it is so frustrating to have interruptions while watching a show (those that can be watch. I will pursue some reimbursement or exchange for the money. It is great to watchthose shows that made it okay into DVD's."
1,Kung Phooey,"I haven't seen any episodes in this series since they were broadcast in the 1970's and I recalled that I found them vaguely amusing. I was wrong. The plots are thin and ridiculous, the acting execrable, the dialogue silly and the martial arts action laughable. (Chuck Norris supposedly remarked that he acts about as well as David Carradine does martial arts. Trust me, Chuck Norris acts much better than David Carradine did martial arts.) The net result is that these are quite painful to watch, the video equivalent of Chinese water torture."
5,Incomplete product information on Amazon.com,"I have nothing to add to the glowing reviews of this dvd set other than to point out that it IS subtitled (in English, French and Spanish). This is not noted in the ""product information list"" given by Amazon. A note in Spanish follows:ESTE PRODUCTO VIENE SUBTITULADO EN ESPAÑOL, LO CUAL NO SE MENCIONA EN LA INFORMACION SOBRE EL PRODUCTO DADA POR AMAZON."
4,a gift for my dad,My Dad has always been a fan of Kung Fu and enjoyed the gift very much. The price was very reasonable and was shipped in a very timely manner
4,East Meets West,"It is a shame Bruce Lee never got the lead role in this series , it would have been great to see the master at work in at least a couple of episodes. David Carradine is excellent however and Keye Luke and Phillip Ahn are my favourite characters in this show. It is set against a western backdrop , and interestingly enough the script is as reflective of attitudes today as it was then"
4,Kung Fu Collection,"We loved the collection, however there was one DVD that did not play properly. I thought my husband would watch it over time. He watched all of it in 2 weeks."
3,Incomplete,"Some of the episodes are missing, some are rearranged out of sequence. One episode shows him still insearch of his brother 2 episodes after he had found his brother and that part of his family had been reunited.The missing episodes are those of Caine when he learns of his own son, at least 2 episodes are missing maybe 1/2 a season or more!"
5,Kung Fu for Life!!!,"David Carridine was the bomb when it came to this amazing show set in turn of the century America. Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin Priest on the run after killing the Chinese Emperor's nephew in China and is forced to leave his home for safety. He ends up in California on a mission to find his relatives but staying on the run as bounty hunters and other scumbags hunt him to return him to China for his crime. The show contains plenty of action and great story lines concerning prejudice, cowardice and hatred but nothing beats the flashbacks to Caine's past as a child and young man training to be a Shaolin priest as he puts past lessons into action. I loved this show as a kid and the set come's in three action packed discs in a deluxe package box. Enjoy and it's for the entire family!"
1,Kung Fu Season 2 Episode Title Teaser Scenes - Yea of Nay?,"Can anyone who has the Region 1 Second Season or Complete Series DVD release of Kung Fu confirm whether the second season episodes include the original TV broadcast teaser scenes from ""..tonight's Kung Fu episode"" seen in the opening titles and credits of each episode? I have the Region 4 release (Australia) and they have been glaringly omitted. Any feedback from those with a Region 1 copy would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!"
4,"great set, minor flaws","This is a great set for the series. Nice additional content along with the first season being presented in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen, while the remaining 2 seasons are in the traditional 4:3 standard tv ratio.the flaw mentioned is minor, this set is made up of doublesided discs. Disc 1, season 1 has the sides mislabelled. Side A is actually side B and B is actually A, the other discs seem to be labeled properly.4 stars simply because of the doublesided discs with one having the sides mislabelled. These are the exact same sets you would get if you bought the seasons individually."
5,Kung Fu Amazing,"I could not be more pleased with the complete set. The video was very clear the audio was perfect. I couldn't ask for a more perfect product. It was as if I was watching it on tv in the 70's. But much better, no commericials!!I recieved my order right on time. No complainte from me."
5,Kung Fu The COmplete Series Collection,"This is an awesome series! We need more David Carradines, Grasshoppers, today. A very simple and humble man who stood for principles and honor. Boy could we use some of that today. Unfortunately the youth today think that reality crap we have on TV today has some deep life satisfying message. Anyway, buy it, watch it, and live it."
3,fun to watch,I like it. It is nice to see what the Carradines where like back in the day.I am happy with it.
4,Kung Fu: The complete series,"Great price... but the folding case on the DOUBLE sided DVDs causes the disc to wear right away. The series was fun... but drugs are evident in certain cast members... and maybe the pace of the show comes from that. Teens might not enjoy the slow pace. The Kung Fu is terrible, but that isn't the point of Kung Fu series, isn't it.Makes me shake my head every time they refer to him as ""Chinese."""
4,I saw this when it was new on TV,"Received it as a Christmas gift, not sure if I would like it after so long a period of time, but it was everything I remembered. Knowing how Carradine died in 2009 colors my experience a little, since as a child watching it on TV, I had no thought that the actors were also human, but it was still darn good viewing and I'm thankful for the opportunity to reconnect with the show!"
3,Disc messed up,The last disk of the series is backwards. The ending is on side A. Then you have to flip it over to see what you missed. Not real happy because I thought it would be a nice collector.
3,The decline of the show more evident from the set,"I was a fan of the series when it originally aired. Now, finally, the complete series is available on DVD. The packaging is nicely done. Although, I don't like the way they labeled the discs-or should I say-didn't label them. Sometimes it was difficult to know which side was needed- to pick up where I left off. The bonus material was well worth it-as it gives insight into the creation of the show-and other tid-bits of information. Sadly, one can see how the writing of the show gradually became poor. Season One is outstanding. Season Two, somewhat mediocre-and Season Three-well-it was hard to watch. It became obvious to me that the show would not have survived a Season Four. Still, the entire set is something a fan would want. If you haven't seen any of the episodes, maybe just Season One is all you need."
4,Still not perfect...,"I admit this is the best collection available. However, this is not 100% one. Where is ""For my lady"", one of my favorites?"
5,One of the Best Band's Best Collection,"This is a great compilation. Starting with the sixties tune ""Go Now,"" when the group was in it's infancy, the CD just continues to go through the essential repertoire. The Moody's, along with The Beatles and Procol Harem, were an integral part of bringing rich, symphonic arrangements to Rock. This CD is a marvelous showcase of that phenomenon. They are also one of the best synthesizer groups ever, as well. Only ELP and Yes can compete in that category.I highly endorse this CD. Excellent recorded sound, well thought out song selections. Forget ""The Best of The Moody Blues."" If you want to hear the best songs the band recorded, definitely spend your money on this one.BEK"
3,Another Anthology?,"Whatever happened to ""This Is The Moody Blues"", which had a far superior song selection taken from the main seven albums. I guess it fell prey to good old record company policy."
4,"Great Music , Poor Endings","I absolutely love this Anthology. I would suggest it for any Moody Blues fan.My only problem , and it just may be my CD's , is that the last song on both CD's are cut off prematurely. This may be due to the groups propensity to go from one song to another with no pause between them.All in all , a great effort."
5,Creme De La Creme,"This is the ultimate best of the Moody Blues! This Double CD contains 33 hits that you can't stop listenning to on and on! From the brilliant hit ""Nights in White Satin"" to ""Blue World, ""Blue Guitar"", ""Your Wildest Dreams"" and ""The Other Side of Life"". Buy this CD and you won't regret it.pixel"
4,Did exactly what I needed them to do,I bought these molds for zombie brain cupcakes. They turned out grossly cute. The only complaint I would have is that the plastic breaks easily. I was hoping to use them for halloween but it broke when I was washing it. So they're great for a one time use or if you're very very gentle with them.
5,Quick and Valuable Little Guide Before You Go,"A great little book to take a look at before you go or to read on the way there. It's short and to the point. Terrific drawings of each area.Also has such a ""you are there"" feel that it is an especially valuable little synopsis for historians, researchers, writers, and others who won't be visiting the site in person.This book matches the tour stops, and can be used with the Park Service's auto-tour map or audio cassettes, too.Highly recommended."
2,just ok,"these look cool but I have found they are not very useful for me. It is hard when draining pasta to hold the big heavy pot with one hand and the strainer in another. I didnt realize till I started using this product how inconvenient it is.....and the hot steam also burns when having to hold the strainer. For these reasons I NEVER use it. I bought one that lays over the sink....no holding it involved. If your in the market for a strainer I would suggest buying one that sits over the sink or one that has a bottom that you can set in your sink, otherwise its just a PAIN."
1,Inadequate,"I love Elfquest, and have been a long-time fan of Wendy Pini's moving stories and delicate, sensitive artwork. That said, these ""pocket-sized"" versions of Elfquest are a travesty. In the early ones the art is so small you can barely tell what's going on, and in the later books, such as this one, it appears that they have attempted to reorganize the art -- splitting what was originally one page into 2. This has resulted in the art being big enough to see, but the layouts of the pages appearing haphazard. Also, because these books are often grayscaled reproductions of what was originally color art, the art looks muddy. Even later editions have that problem.I'd recommend that both long-time fans and newbies avoid these editions like the plague, and do the best you can to get ahold of the original issues, or at least the older, full-sized graphic novels that Warp produced in the 90's."
4,batteries will kill ya,"The sounds are cute, the way the eggs fit into the carton (basically a shape puzzle) is educational for baby, the faces on the tops of the eggs are priceless (also educational because baby has to match the face on the top of the shell with the face on the chick)...BUT the toy requires three 1.5V button cell batteries! The total cost of the batteries equals half the cost of the entire toy! Since the batteries that came with the toy died after less than a month, we already spent too much on this toy...But the toy is a ton of fun; we just don't turn it on too often."
2,Not very entertaining,I bought this toy several months ago for my 15 month old daughter. So far she hasn't been very interested in it. Usually she just scatters the eggs around and pokes her fingers into the holes to hear the sounds. It really looked like a lot of fun to me but as yet my daughter is not convinced.
2,Not very fun until 3,"My son recieved this as an easter present when he was almost 2. The toy did not stay together very well if it was even bumped on the floor. He had a hard time getting the pegs into the little holes to put them in the right places. It was very frustrating for him and after a couple times, we put it up and just recently brought it back out for him to play with. He is now 3, and is able to match things up and get it to co-operate with him a little better. Personally, i would not go out and buy this toy."
5,Great toy!,"I bought this eggs for my daughter when she was 7 months old. It was on sale so I did not even take note of the age range. Personally I thought the toy was cute although my husband did not think so. Of course, my daughter could not do the sorting yet. She love to suck the eggs, bang them or throw them from the box. It is very durable. It's her favorite toy and she has lots of fun with it."
3,cute but not that exciting,"my 2 year old likes the eggs themselves and likes to carry them around and finds them appealing but its hard for him to see the shapes on the bottom and fit them in because the shape is teeny tiny. I think it would be a cute seasonal item, the pieces are easy to lose though. They dont stay in the tray very well."
2,a stretch,"Bourdain is an irresistible presence on TV, no doubt. But he is no storyteller when working in prose. This story was thinner than consommé and about as mentally nutritious. Enjoy the tv show with all it's exotic locales and characters because the author brings none of the titillation to this effort."
2,What a disappointment,Maybe I was expecting to much. I don't know a lot about the mob first hand but the ending in this seemed just almost too easy considering the struggle that had taken place. Lot of drug use and foul language which isn't shocking considering the cast. It is a very straight forward story that is easy to follow but when you're reading it you find yourself going back to find out who the character is that has just been reintroduced. The police and some of the lesser seen mob members seem to become easily forgotten to the point that it is a little confusing. It seemed to focus on gourmet food as much as anything else.
3,Nice easy read.,GREAT BOOK FOR THE CAR TRIP GOING ON VACATION. KEPT ME INGROSSED SO THE TIME IN THE CAR DID NOT SEEM SO LONG. GREAT SET OF CHARACTERS AND NICE RECIPES AS WELL.
2,Entertaining except.........,"True, this would have been a fun, fast read. It would have been even faster, say, 50 pages shorter, if he just took out one word. I'm afraid that one word spoiled it for me. On occasion is one thing, three times in every sentence is another. I prefer well written English, not trash talk. Sorry."
3,Not the best of Bourdain...,Not the best of Bourdain but it is a easy read and a good book to have on the beach while drinking coco loco. The characters are ok if a bit underdeveloped and the plot is a classic mob story with some incompetent cops thrown into the bargain. Bourdain still manages to trap you in his narrative and will have you turning the pages fast. You will be entretained!
2,Blah,It could have been better for sure it took 70% in before anything really happened. Won't be reading anymore Bourdain fiction.
3,Mildly entertaining.,"The best parts of the book are the semi-autobiographical elements which are probably lifted from the author's career as a chef. The convuluted plot includes dealings with the mafia, and ends pretty unsatisfactorily.Where the author excels is entertaining the reader with tales about the sex, drugs, and criminal behavior, and he's only talking about the restaurant staff. He let's us in on the secrets behind how food is delivered to your table at dinner time.For a better look behind the restaurant business, I recommend reading his non-fiction works Kitchen Confidential and A Cook's Tour."
3,Might want to stick with cooking/TV,"I love Anthony Bourdain's TV shows and snarky humor, but was disappointed in this book. I feel the writing was a bit sophmoric and nothing shy of stereotypical mob stories you could find on TV. I don't think the ending fit the rest of the book - it went on and on during the storyline and then just ended. Kind of like, we got tired of writing, so let's just have this happen, the end. It's ok - buy it if it's less than 3 dollars as it isn't worth more than that."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Really like Anthony Bourdain - TV and books like Kitchen Confidential. Wasn't expecting much from this, but it was quite the enjoyable read. I could see everything as it went down, and wow...some of it was quite graphic. If you can get past that, it was a good story - great character development, good writing.I'm pleased that my favorite chef-turned-TV-star is now writing books. Is there anything he can't do?"
4,Criminal Recipe,"Like the last reviewer I too was holding my breath as I began reading this book, wondering if Bourdain's style could translate into a novel. It succeeded -- not in the first few pages but certainly after the first chapter. I'm a fervent fan of Bourdain's food show and enjoy his smack irrevelance on t.v. and his book,""Kitchen Confidential."" Frankly, I love his style, like getting hit on my cheek with the flat of a butcher blade.Yes, ""Bone"" is a little violent, especially at the end when his chief friend took to sliding down the length of a meat slicer. I had the distinct experience to have one slice a bit off my middle finger as a young tykster. It bled like hell, and I cried like hell!O.K., Tony. Keep 'em books coming. Good stuff. I'da buy 'nother your good book.A Fan"
5,A better mousetrap!,"Wonderful. We tried the traditional wooden base spring traps, tried a live capture trap the little mice kept taking the bait and then went on to our food.One night with the cups filled with peanut butter, two traps, back to back, along a wall (as suggested by others) and the next morning - success! Two dead mice.The key to this design - all plastic except for the metal spring and trap bars -- is that an entire side is the trigger platform. The bait goes into a ""cup"" in the base and the trigger platform has a hole to expose the cup. The prey needs to get on the platform to get the bait and therefore trigger the trap."
4,I like the design,Although I haven't caught anything yet (maybe they saw this and went elsewhere) I like how the trap is set. This is easy to set and would also be easy when disposing.
5,excellent mousetrap....the best out there,"I used 2 other brands of mouse traps and was not able to catch any mice in my basement. Frustrated, I ordered this product..and viola......the mice are history overnight. I am so pleased! Highly recommend this product."
5,Snap-E Mouse Trap,"This mouse trap is truly ""a better mouse trap"". I have a hunting camp in the mountains that I think mice use more than I do. I've tried other mouse traps with around 60% success.With these Snap-E Mouse traps there are no misses. So far, success is 100%! No misses!"
5,the Perfect mousetrap,"I've lived for thirteen years next to miles of open fields in Colorado. I have to catch lots of mice. I've been using this trap for the past two years. It's perfect. It always kills instantly, never maims. It has never misfired. It's easy to set, and doesn't go off in my hand as I'm putting it in place. It's reusable. I've caught over 30 mice with just a few traps. Every one has been an instant, clean kill.I once caught a mouse in a ""humane"" trap in the garage, and forgot it. The caged mouse died of thirst. No more of that for me. My old style wooden traps often caught the mouse by the paw, so I had to kill him myself. I don't enjoy that either. This SnapE trap is indeed the best way to deal with mice."
5,Another one bites the dust!!,"Wow, my girlfriend and I live in an apartment building that was built in 1957, we also live across the street from a large public park with an open field. We chuckled when we read the reviews where people were saying ""we caught mice in the first hour"" or ""we've caught seven mice"", we got a kick out of these reviews because our mice are smart. We've tried 2 different kinds of traps, the old school victor style and an off brand of the same style. The mice were easily able to steal the peanut butter without triggering them. Well, I'm happy to report that 5 minutes ago, we caught our third mouse. It took a week for us to catch the first, and now we've caught two since. 3 in in 3 nights. We're very pleased! Great service from Amazon, superior design from Kness, also made in my home state of Iowa! If you're thinking about buying these, don't! Just do it!"
5,Definitely Better,"I get no joy out of killing them, but the voles have driven me to this. Nothing has worked, not the castor oil, the bleach, the ammonia, the commercial pest deterrents, or the dish detergent. This week I set up traps, some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I've only caught one vole; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it. Set up is simple, no tricky bar to set. Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place. Removing the dead vole was easy too. Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground. I buried it right there.It's an unpleasant business, but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I've caught two more voles with this same trap. Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one."
5,Please buy it! works every time.,"Oh my gosh, I know you wont believe me, but it works everytime, 10 times out of 10. Its worth it."
1,Horrible,The worst and useless. Tried 10 times and not one success. Often maims the mouse especially the limbs. Stick with the old fashioned style which works almost 100 % of the time.
4,great product........,"I purchased several of these last year for the first time and was very happy with them......it is especially nice you don't have to touch the area where the mouse is when you release it from the trap....even though, I still wear gloves when I set it up, or have to reset.......great product....purchase some, you won't be disappointed....."
5,This thing flat out works,"Within 20 minutes of setting this trap, I caught the 1st mouse. Buy these."
5,By far the best trap!,"I agree with others. This really is the best trap. I have used victor traps. They are okay, but are easy targets for having their bait stolen. These traps are much better designed and can be reused. Most importantly, they are much easier to set. In the last few days, I've caught two mice that have swiped the bait on at least 5 traps.Another benefit is that it is easy to dispose of the mouse carcass. You can't say this about the Victor product."
5,Snap it up!,I love this mouse-trap! Probably gonna get a couple more. Best I've ever used. Hope it lasts a long time.
4,I didn't catch anything but I assume the trap is good,The mouse left in the meantime so I didn't get the chance to test it :) It looks like it can catch a mouse though.
5,"Great Product, Highly Recommend",Very easy to set and to despose of afterward. A Lot more safe to set than the wooden ones. Thanks for offering this product.
1,Flimsy product,This would appear to be an answer to the long-sought-after better mouse trap. It might be if it were well constructed. It caught one mouse which apparently weakened the latch holding the spring. Shortly after I reset the trap the latch broke off. I would return it for a refund except it would cost more than the trap itself.
2,Either this doesnt work or the rats are too smart for this..,"Bottom line for a product like this is fairly easy.. Either it does the job its designed to or not.. Well in this case, i couldnt catch even one mouse.. I ordered two of these.. First of all, its really really small.. i don't think big rats will even fit into the trap.. Mostly for small ones.. When I have set it up, the following day the cheese is gone,, but i see no sign of a mouse or even its whiskers..What a waste of money.. And whats more, the shipping is kind of more expensive than the trap in itself.. I wont recommend."
5,Great product,"Every year when it gets a little cold we find mice in the basement. This trap is by far the most effective, and most easy to use."
2,"Good idea, poor quality","I purchased 5 of these traps and 2 of the 5 were so poorly made the bar would not latch under the arming hook. And one of the others ""misfired"" after the first day. Poorly made. I would not even spend the time sending them back. They made it as far as the trash can. $10.00 wasted."
2,"It's easy to use, yet...","I put PB in the reservoirs along with sunflower seeds. Yes, the designer built a better mouse trap. Yet, the mice continue to run the house and I haven't killed one yet and six are loaded and placed."
3,Feedback requested,We use cheese or peanutbutter bait. No results. Have seen mouse and not a rat as you suggested. Found valentine candy shredded to eat chocolate. Baited with chocolate...still none were caught in traps. Confused.
5,Worked within 20 mins of first usage,Been dealing with mice issues during the winter time for the past few years. I wanted a non-lethal method to capture these guys but nothing worked. I finally gave into a lethal trap as I have kids and didn't want anyone getting sick. I put this trap where the mice come in. 20 minutes later I hear a snap and it caught one. Overnight it caught another one. Very effective
2,"getting there, but no panacea","In its favour: easy and safe setting, and very easy corpse removal, with no need to touch the dead mouse.Against: cheap materials- which means that the trigger breaks after maybe 3 snaps."
2,Trigger problems,"Trap is easy enough to set when new. However if used in a garage or outside where trap is exposed to abrasive dirt or sand, the trigger mechanism will fail in short order. This results in trap being difficult to set, or when set trap will not trip when treadle is pressed."
5,It doesn't get any better than this !,"I am a prime member with an average of 100 products purchased per year. However I never bother reviewing my purchases and overall i am a happy amazon customer.In my attempt to take care of my rodent problem I got 3 Snap-E mouse traps after trying the ancient designed victor wooden platform trap, the victor electronic trap, a small animal cage type trap ( cougt one and that was it )and the AgriZap rat zapper classic ( purple )...MY SEARCH IS NOW OVER ! THESE 3 TRAPS KILLED 4 RATS IN LESS THAN 20 HOURS. THE BAIT USED IS A SMALL PIECE OF PARMESAN CHEESE COVERED IN PEANUT BUTTER, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT THE TINY TUBE INSIDE TE PEDAL. I USE THE TRAP OUTDOORS AND I MIGHT END UP CLEANING THE ENTIRE STREET OF THESE UNWANTED GUESTS.LONG STORY SHORT THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CATCH RATS ! HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !"
5,Best Product Out There!,"First let me say this product is reusable. That is if you don't mind getting close to a dead mouse and cleaning it off for the next one,. It killed 2 in a matter of hours!"
4,it does the job!,"Works as advertised. Easy to set, triggers appropriately, kills the mouse. Giving it a four rather than five because there were no instructions with the device. Was not hard to figure it out, but still, it's reasonable to expect some guidance."
5,Great product,Easy to use. Much better than the standard mouse trap. The old type mouse traps are very sensitive and prone to closing while setting the trap. The mechanism in this unit is very secure and I never worry about getting my fingers smashed. Release is extremely easy and your fingers never get close to those dead critters.
5,Awesome,One trap has caught 3 mice over the last week! Such a great product and easy to set. Definitely worth the extra money.
5,No more mice!,"I live in an urban area in a first floor apartment and had discovered a mouse nest in one of my cupboards recently. Being an animal lover, I tried out a couple have-a-heart traps that beyond catching two mice over a week (who looked very traumatized once caught), were fairly useless. After hearing lovely gnawing noises in the middle of the night I decided to take action and order two Snap-E mousetraps. After receiving them I set one around 5pm and went out for an hour. When I came back there was a mouse in the trap! Another hour, another mouse. Set overnight I caught one in each trap. 4 mice in 12 hours, and I haven't seen any since! Clean up is super easy and the traps are definitely reusable. Definitely more humane than using poison or glue traps, the mouse is killed instantly and I am very happy with this product!"
1,A Worse Mousetrap,"I've tried all kinds of mouse traps. The only ones that work are the old fashioned spring traps on a wooden board you can get at the hardware store.What's wrong with this one? The spring is not strong enough. I repeatedly find the trap sprung, but no mouse in it. The only thing I can figure is the spring is too weak to grip them firmly, or the spring is weak so the trap doesn't close fast enough (mice have very fast reaction times).Back to the old spring traps. They work every time."
2,they are stealing the bait,"At first it worked great. For the last few days now, when I have gone to check the trap in the morning, the well has been licked dry. Sometimes when I check the trigger with a pencil the trap doesn't go off until I really push hard. The mice are stealing the bait and laughing all the way to their hideout."
2,Something is missing...,"I chewed on a piece of gum and stuck it inside the cavity. Two weeks later the trap is upside down, the gum is out and the mouse is gone.So I checked the package contents and I think what is missing are instructions for the mouse on how to get killed by the trap."
3,mice eradication,"I am generally pleased with this product. However, it has caught 5 mice and each time it becomes harder to set the trap: it is now almost impossible to set it without tripping it yourself. I am not sure if the spring mechanism wears out or if it is just intended for one use. It really is not made for multiple uses though."
5,Best trap out there!,unless you want 'em alive and then I suggest the Mice Cube. I was so happy to find these Snap-E traps because every other one I purchased at the hardware store was junk. I was just feeding the mice with those other traps!
5,Best Mouse Trap Ever,We had the sneakiest mouse for weeks. Every night it would eat ALL the peanut butter or cheese that we put on the conventional traps we got at the store. I decided to take a chance on this trap as a last resort. It only took ONE day for us to get that sucker! I couldn't be happier.
4,"Gets the mouse, most of the time","This wonderful contraption has four features that I love: 1) It's incredibly easy to set, and unlike many, more expensive traps, the catch mechanism doesn't seem to wear out. I've lost count of the number of other traps I've had to throw out because the catch stopped working. 2) It's easy to unload the mouse without having to touch anything that touched the animal. 3) In seems to get the mouse's head or neck full-on, appearing to kill the mouse quickly. With other traps I've seen them caught just by their noses and I imagine that their demise was likely slow and painful. I don't want that. And last 4) they're cheap! I paid $1.99 here at Amazon which makes it possible to get bunches of 'em to place in and out around the house.The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because sometimes the traps go off and the mouse escapes entirely, but this is the exception, not the rule."
3,Big one is too big.,"The smaller of these two spatulas is about the right size and works pretty well. The larger one is way too long for anything I cook, plus as the previous reviewer noted, it's rough surface makes it hard to get under whatever you're lifting, so if it's heavy, the item sits at the end of the long blade and then folds down and falls when you try to lift... not worth much unless maybe you're scrabling eggs on a large grill, then you could slop the eggs around nicely with the big one.UPDATE June, 2007It took me quite some time before I used the smaller of these for pancakes... doesn't work well! The heat softens the silicon and it curves up, penetrating the bottom of the pancake and seperating it, leaving the bottom torn up or pulled in half. I tried several ways of angling the spatula to prevent it, but in every case it curled up on the end and broke into the pancake instead of sliding under and lifting."
1,On the way out!,"I bought two of these spatulas, they are both in the out box. I am sure there is a use for them, but I haven't found it. They are too flexable for most of my applications. Like most of us, I don't have the room to store items that do not have multiple uses. They only thing I have found these good for, is removing cookies from a cookie sheet."
2,very disappointed...,"The necklace broke after just one wearing. It snagged on something & then the thin plastic holding the necklace together just snapped. I'm really disappointed, because the necklace was otherwise beautiful."
4,Good indie release,"I love The Rainmakers debut album for its hit, 'Downstream'. I found this recording to be allot of fun to listen to as well. They like to use a great deal of wit in their lyrics and it makes the music interesting as well as entertaining. If they every come to the East coast, I'll go see them in a heartbeat."
4,Not the Best Frickie But Still Very Good,"This album doesn't contain the best of Janie Frickie, but it's still a very good album. Frickie is one of the few modern singers who sings clearly enough so that you can understand every word. A very beautiful and exceptionally smooth voice. This album won't disappoint, but I recommend ""17 Greatest Hits"" if you can find it. I would buy whatever you can get your hands on because for a long time Frickie's albums were very hard to find. I can't understand why Janie hasn't had more popularity as she is an exceptional singer. A must for country music fans."
4,informative as well as entertaining,"I bought this book for a paper I was writing. surprisingly, it was entertaining as well informative. I liked the fact that it included many genres of writing such as poetry, essays, stories, memoirs, etc."
5,Thanks,This product came to me in close to perfect condition. I needed it for my college humanities class. Thank you for it.
3,"okay, but not great","This is not a bad book on bedrooms, if you are just starting out exploring interior decoration. The pictures are nice and the text fairly informative. However, for interior design junkies there is no new ground covered here, especially if you already own several books on bedrooms. I was not inspired by the photos. Probably because the style seems kind of bland to me."
5,The Best I've Heard In A Long Time,"Very catchy tunes in this CD - brilliant lyrics and melodies. Could do without ""Yvonne Alina."" ""Love turns its back"" more than makes up for it, though."
5,"brilliant lyrics,arrangement,all 'round entertainment","The cut entitled ""love turns it's back on me"" should be a top 40 hit."
3,like the hannah montana doll,this doll is like that hannah montana doll that can change to miley to hannah and kennedy is like hannah with blonde hair then brown hair
3,hair mess,"This is a really pretty doll, and yes my daughter likes it but. But her hair is supposed to change colors when you twist the top of her scalp around and it just turns her whole head of hair into a MESS."
2,My Scene Jungle-Licious Kennedy Doll,Pretty much the same type of doll as a Brat Doll. Nothing wrong with the item but it wasn't what I expected. I didn't think that the Brat Dolls were very good for a small child to own so I purchased this type and was surprised to find almost the same idea of a doll who might actually in real life be a lady of the evening. It was nicely made and my Granddaughter liked it ok. Not bad for the price.
1,BOOO,"AK LOVE IS A SORRY RAPPER, THIS CD IN MY OPINION SUCKS!!!!HE'LL NEVER COME UP, HE MAKES THE DENVER HIP HOP SCENE SEEM PITAFUL...."
1,"Failed to ship, Still not received !","I ordered and paid USD20.77 via Amazon on 7 Nov 06 but up today, still not received this CD yet. Please kindly help me to trace whereabout? If you cannot locate it, I would much appreciated if you could re-send one to me or refund the money back. I already missed the Christmas Season to serve it as a gift !Thanks and best regards,Helen"
2,"Ah Jon, what happened?","Yes, I bought this movie because Jon Bon Jovi was in it. My male friends wanted to watch it for the T&A factor, and we all love a good bad movie. This one, unfortunately, missed the mark on all of it. The story was boring and predictable, no T&A (except for the deleted scenes where there was way too much of it.) Bon Jovi and Faustino actually did a pretty good job, they made their characters somewhat likable and charismatic, but the script was worse than your usual National Lampoon fare. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,mediocre,"There are very few laughs in this movie. David Faustino and Nora Dunn couldn't even save it. And, predictable, the good guy wins. I only rented it, very glad I did not purchase it."
2,What do you expect from a National Lampoon Movie?,"I'm an avid Jon Bon Jovi fan and thought he did well in a movie that's script should be burnt, I should have realised considering it's a National Lampoon's T & A movie. Light hearted and slightly amusing - Jon's looking good as usual."
4,"pretty funny, much better than previous lampoon releases","This movie was a lot better than recent movies released by ""National Lampoon"", or at least a watered down version of a name you used to be able to trust. As compared to recent releases such as Spring Break and Pledge this, this movie gets an oscar for best picture. This follow Jon Bon Jovi as Frank, a down and out invetor/thinker who gave up a life as a lawyer to pursue a career in promotion and sales. When he thinks he's lost it all, filling out a simple survey brings new fortune and potential fame his way, along with changing the lives of many others for the better. David Faustino (Married with Children) is co star as Franks best friend, and unlikely legal consultant when the bubble gets busted. Rent this movie, find out what happens, and chuckle while you do it. Worth a rental, or purchase."
2,Pucked,"This is the worse of all the movies JBJ has appeared in. But for the bon Jovi fan, it is worth shutting off the sound, sitting back with a glass of wine, and enjoying it purely for voyeuristic purposes. A really bad career choice for Bon Jovi"
5,"In perfect condition, with quick delivery","The DVD plays perfectly and the case looks new. Delivery was fast, and the price was great!"
5,You have the luxury of time...,"... so use it! This is simply a great rock 'n' roll record. Brilliant songwriting, great hooks and after 3 listens you'll be singing along like a football hooligan. What a talent! Worth purchasing, if only for the drums on 'World of a King'. I loves it, I do."
5,A must for every serious music collection,David Mead hit a home run with The Luxury of Time. If you really want to invest in your future buy two copies and keep one in the wrapper. Just think what an unopened Beatles White Album would be worth today. David's album will be a classic.
1,The Agony of Time.,"How in the world is this guys music getting stars!?! He's such a no-tal. I got a free promo of his cd, listened to the first song, and it made me sick. I tried to sell it at a used cd store, but they already had 8 copies in the 99 cent bin. They offered me 10 cents for it. I ended up throwing the cd in the trash can, and keeping the case because an empty cd case is worth more than David Mead's music. At least if you do buy it, get it from a used cd store. They will have dozens on hand at outrageously low prices."
2,Don't Count on it,"While the book is an interesting potpouri of miscellani, it lacks insight, cohesion, or interest. And while I see and respect Jessica's love for the Crows, her writing style is very amateur. The book offers little true insight and instead reads more like a statistical yearbook, except that it only shows those statistics most favorable to the Crows. Jessica's occasional semi-poetic personal musings are rather annoying when they are used to fill a page in this sparse book (which, by the way, can hardly be called a biography). If you buy this book, you will probably pick up a couple pieces of trivia about the Crows that you didn't know before. But that's all you'll get. Worth $14? That's for you to decide, but I'd pass."
1,Not even finished,"First of all, the picture shows the whole set, the truth is you only get one (the page doesn't specify the amount). Second, it's not properly done, to use it you'll have to sand it completely otherwise, your pet could get hurt with the rough borders and the splinters. I don't recommend it at all."
3,Not really useful... Other than interior design of the cage.,"I thought that this will be a perfect ""house"" for my hamster, but it really WAS NOT!!!! My hamster barely stayed in there, more than a min or two. Don't worry about the wood, it is edible. The size is not too bad actually, it is possible for an adult hamster to fit in there."
4,A hilarious book that was hard to put down,A must read for any male or female who wants to know what other women go through behing those secret doors! Many times I was laughing so hard tears rolled down my face. Some of the gynocological secrets (bacon) were too funny. I have reccomended this book to all my (mostly female) friends.
2,good product but picture very deceiving.,"The picture shows two products, therefore we thought we were going to get a large one and a small one but surprise! just one came, False photo, wrong advertising, a trick? any way I am not to happy with this, for one the price was to high, beter with two, as picture shows, but just be aware of photo trickery......."
4,GOOD JOB FOR THE FIRST TIME AROUND,"ANGIE IS A REALLY TALENTED SINGER. I ENJOY PRETTY MUCH ALL OF HER CUTS. AND BELIEVE ME ""NO MORE RAIN IN THIS CLOUD"" IS NOT THE ONLY GOOD SONG. I REALLY LOVE: COULD OF BEEN YOU, EVERYTHING, LOVE JUNKIE, BLACK DIAMONDS, BLUE PEARLS, AND THE BONUS TRACK. THIS IS A WELL THOUGHT THROUGH CD. HATS OFF TO ANGIE STONE. SHE REMINDS YOU OF MAXWELL, ERIC BENET, DEANGELO AND ERIKA BADU SO IF YOU LIKE THESE ARTIST YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY ANGIE STONE."
5,Good luck just like a black diamond,"This album is full of soul and is a wake up call to me. Where did she come from? I love the vibe that this album carries, so sacred yet in perfect reach for the public, personalized yet generalized. I look forward to keeping my eyes peeled for all next moves of hers. Please Ms.Angie Stone, keep it coming."
4,Nice Solo Effort....but,"I completely agree with the last couple of reviewers, however after some time listening to the CD, it hasnt exactly made it to the top pile of current favorites. The songs are very well sung, and there is no doubting Angie's abilities, however many of the songs DO seems to run on, and the instrumentation/beats can be a little lackluster at times. Considering Angie's voice and her powerful lyrics, the music seems to yearn to match her power. Her latest effort however, looks to have corrected this problem, as is evidenced by the first release. Check out Angie's sophmore album, you wont be dissapointed!"
5,Gospel according to Stone,"THis is an amazing debut CD. Full of funk , soul and gospel chords. It is very derivative of early 70's funk. One can hear Curtis Mayfield & Stevie Wonder at times. Beautiful and powerful voice. Upbeat, sleazy and soulful."
5,a delightful surprise,"picked this one up without thinking. liked the cover. heard a few tunes, but knew nothing about her.well, i've now got someone to watch for. the tunes are great. grooving. mood inducing. turn the lights down dim, open up some wine and have someone you love nearby."
4,A very promising debut from a new soul gem-cutter!,"I picked up Black Diamond at the beginning of October and it has steadily grown on me. The cd is filled with depth, manifest talent and promise for a long future for Sista Stone. Stone has a clear soulful voice -- she sangs with taste and subtle nuance. Every track is worth a listen resulting in one of those rare 90's soul albums which can be appreciated as a whole and be enjoyed for individual tracks. Great cd to clean up the house to, or chill with someone special or while washing and chopping those greens for Sunday dinner! One of the best soul releases this year."
2,"Retro is fine, but make it good retro","There's some decent music on here, but this ground was covered much better (and by a better singer) by Adriana Evans a couple years back. I'm all for music that doesn't hit me with inordinate amounts of rump-shaking lyrics and asinine sensibilities, but at least make it something I'll be listening to a month after I buy it. If you like the singles that have been played out, then the rest of the record may be more to your liking anyway, but there are better records trying to kick the same vibe, and that do it better. (Evans, Amel Larrieux, Erykah badu, Caron Wheeler)"
1,Where is the originality,"I bought this CD with the hopes of it being a great cd just like the cds of the 70s and 80s. However, I was very disappointed because every song on the cd is a sample of the great artists from the 70s and 80s. I should have know that I was in for a shock when I heard No More Rain. That song is a sample of Gladys Knight's Neither One Of Us. I'll admit that Angie Stone has a very soulful voice, but she is all hype. Anyone expecting the rest of the cd to be like No More Rain is in for a surprise. Why should I have to pay $15.00 for a cd when she could have released the single and I would have been HAPPIER? I am not surprised that several people are calling this a soulful cd because most people don't know what real soul is. Especially, when people consider Destiny's Child to be soulful. Where is the originality?"
2,I was disappointed,"The first time I heard Angie Stone's song ""No More Rain"" I knew I would end up buying her CD. I usually stick to just Gospel music, but a guy told me that she had some really touching spiritual notes in her CD cover and the song ""No More Rain"" touched me so deeply I just knew I would love the CD. The spiritual notes are, in fact, really beautiful but her lyrics don't entirely agree with what she ""preaches"". Using profanity and smokin' green grass are not very Chirst-like activities...we should be vessels for His spirit. Doers and not just hearers (and repeaters) of His Word. But, of course, if you don't mind profanity and weed, you'll probably love it."
5,Brilliant stuff,"Angie Stone has a unique and powerful voice. This albumn is so varied and interesting. One of the best albumns I have bought in years. If you like classic, obscure soul, this is for you."
5,this diamond is a pure treasure,"i'll admit i was slot to jump onto the angie stone bandwagon a couple years ago when she went semi-mainstream. although she hasn't received the recent attention as fellow neo-soulite miss jill scott, she is just as deserving. smooth, cool, and soulful are three words that come to mind when listening to 'black diamond.' her music is the reason i have trouble listening to the radio. it's a shame that the american public has taken a liking to juvenile efforts put out by played-out, tired r&b artists like r.kelly, public announcement, jagged edge, sisqo, etc. but maybe if she gets just a little more airtime, she'll find enouch of a niche to blow up and rekindle some of that fire she started two years ago.i love the whole album, and i don't forward through any of the tracks. personal favorites include:'no more rain' - perfect blend of old school r&b and new school soul'everyday' - funkdefied embittered anthem of unrequited love'bone 2 pic' - smooth, subdued, yet powerful"
3,What do you expect from a book that tries to cover everything,This book has plenty of information but I found that only some pertains to the types of fishing I do. It is a useful tool but it does not go into detail in order to cover the many different types of fishing
4,It's complete... generally speaking.,"This manual is a great starter. It has general information about all aspects of fishing, fresh water and salt, spinning casting and trolling, even fly fishing.However it left me a little uninformed with specifics for certain regions and technique. Which I cannot totally agree with as a ""Comlete"" book of rigs and tackle.It is however a great purchase for the fisherman who is just getting started or for a gift for that aspiring fisherman who needs or desires information on a wide variety of setups and general techniques.I would give it 5 star review as an aforementioned gift or purchse in that case.ciao, Scott"
2,so-so,"I'm very beginner and this books is not useful at all. It looks like a catalog showing what is there on the market, rather than a book with explanation WHY and HOW and WHAT FOR....I can see what lures and reels are there without the book and main concept of bigger reel/bigger rod/ bigger line is also trivial..."
4,good - nice pictures and easy to read,It's another simple to read book - I like it much because it covers almost everuthing I was expecting. easy to read and understand and has many pictures to show. Good book!
5,Great Reference Book,This book is handy to have around or in your tackle box. Gives good information on baits and rigs. The illustrations are very good and advice is sound. I recommend it for all to have as a reference book.
1,Never received,"I did not receive the CD with this cover- I have a ""Boleros"" in pastels where 1 Disc wasmissing. I must have been billed but don't find it= I was about to buy it from the musicon Batanga that plays this album."
5,Fantastic encyclopaedia of working knowledge,"This book gave me a practical guide in how to manage my work life/family life, stress and a lot more topics. Definitely worth the price."
4,Filter is reliable,This filter works pretty good...reliably cleaning the air you breath inside your car...It def made my air fresh and seemed to make my AC n heat work better...the only bad thing i can say about this filter is how fragile it is made...the glue that holds it together almost came apart when i was sliding the filter into the groove inside the filter housing...i made it in without it breaking but i would hope they could just make it a bit studier.
3,Not as great as I thought it would be...,"I read lots of reviews and decided I needed covers for my new SIGG bottles. In our hot Georgia summer, these covers just don't keep the water as cold as I would have liked. If left int he car, the water is warm in about 2 hours. Okay, maybe I am looking for a miracle, but thought it would do a better job. I do like that they protect the bottles and absorb moisture."
3,Not as bad or good as some would lead you to believe,"The record is a minor effort from a talented but (from the albums lyrics) a somewhat bitter guy...not as awful as some reviewers seem to indicate, but it ain't no ""Girlfriend""...fans of power pop will find stuff to like, others looking to dabble stick with ""Girlfriend,"" then maybe ""Altered Beast"" or ""Blue Skies""..."
3,Actually 3.5 stars,"Quine and Lloyd are sorely missed - again.Favorable comparisons to Girlfriend are being made. Not even close. This is a solid effort, but for those hoping/expecting a Girlfriend level record, you'll be disappointed.Looking forward to seeing Matthew put the band back together for the next one."
3,Disapointing,"I am a big MS fan. All of his albums grow on you after a couple of listenings, but this one fails to reach the quality of works like Girlfriend and Blue Sky on Mars. The material is weak (compared to what we usually get from him). Now, notice that I still gave it 3 stars because it is a good record, it just does not compare to any of his other albums which are great. If you have never listened to MS before, please, do not start here. Get Girlfriend or Altered Beast or Blue Sky on Mars first."
3,Definite Reversal of Songcraft,"It seems I'm one of the few (but not the only one) who has noticed the distinct lack of melody on ""In Reverse"" compared to almost every other Matt Sweet album released. Many times the songs start out with promising guitar hooks but don't contain enough harmonic shift in the melody lines to make the vocals interesting. The lead single ""What Matters"" is one of the best tracks here and even this would be considered a throwaway on classic albums like ""Girlfriend"" and ""100% Fun"". Listen to the chorus. It's almost all one note. A so-so album from Sweet is still 3 times as good as the average release, so I'd recommend it, but for fans only. Like others have said, this is NOT a good intro to this very talented songwriter, who definitely has a case of Millennium Blues."
1,Buy 100% Fun and Altered Beast instead,"Boy, what to say about this album -- cringe-inducing I guess is the best I can describe it. If you like the Carpenters-style light pop, by all means snap this up, but if you're looking for good guitar rock with more substance, this is the wrong place to look. I wasn't that fond of Blue Sky on Mars, either, but at least it had Where You Get Love, Hollow, and Into Your Drug. In Reverse doesn't have any saving graces like that. I guess I'm through with Matthew Sweet -- I can't ""write my own song"", as the man says, but I can go listen to something decent, like the Fountains of Wayne."
1,Matt's lost it,"With these last two album releases, Blue Sky on Mars and In Reverse, Sweet is but a faint shadow of what he once was.Sweet's career has been a fairly perplexing and interesting one. He started out playing wimpy synth-dance stuff with those heavy '80s drums. Luckily, he ditched that style and went for power-pop with heavy '60s and early '70s influences, and hit gold. Girlfriend was the breakthrough album for that style. Then came Altered Beast, a noisy, dark album which shattered any expectations of a ""Girlfriend II."" 100% Fun was a return to classic power-pop.After that, Sweet ran out of steam. Blue Sky is extremely pedestrian. In Reverse is even worse. His talent is apparently what is going in reverse. He's lost it.Too bad -- I was a big Matthew Sweet fan for at least three albums, from Girlfriend to 100% Fun. And now this dreck. What happened? Well, I guess ""Nothing Lasts."""
1,"Meandering, Mediocre Pap!","After reading all of these GLOWING reviews I bought this disc. What a mistake. The magic everyone promised Matthew delivers on this disc is missing...No hooks. Notes hammer redundantly, insisting that THIS IS melody, simply by nature of repetition. The upside down and backwards packaging (""in reverse,"" get it? any idiot would...) is annoying. Is this another case of all packaging and no substance? You bet.Vapid, vacuous lyrics wrapped in 2-dimensional production. There are a few clever sounds utilized and some amazing talents on board, but these just can't salvage the mediocrity of the songwriting. All of the comparisons to Brian Wilson's and Phil Spector's production values are lost on me. Musta missed 'em in the self-indulgent, meandering drone of this melody-less mistake.Very disappointing. Thanks to the misleading reviews gushing the virtues of this abortive effort, I wasted my money. This is frisbee material."
4,Another postive vote,"It's interesting to read the opposing views of self-proclaimed Matthew Sweet fans regarding In Reverse. I also am a fan of Sweet and, with the exception of Blue Sky on Mars, believe that he's been one of the few consistently good power pop songwriters of the past decade. In Reverse is a clear return to form for Sweet. Many catchy well crafted songs and a CD totally worth owning. I think this album rivals and possibly even exceeds my previous favorite, 100% Fun."
5,"How Sweet it is! (original play on words, huh?)","This is Matthew Sweet's best and most brilliant. I wish radio and MTV would stop playing Backstreet Boys, NSync, 98degrees, etc. and start playing great music like this album. It's like Simon & Garfunkel got together with Phil Spector and had a baby! Although it's not a perfect album (the album's standout ballad HIDE sounds way too much like ELO's STRANGE MAGIC) it's still a wonderful album!"
2,Incredible disappointment,"Calling ""In Reverse"" a masterpiece or one of the greatest albums ever (as some have here) is so bizarre I don't know where to begin. If this is your idea of great music, keep your CD collection the hell away from me. This is, simply, one of the most disappointing CD purchases I've ever made -- and I'm a big Matthew Sweet fan. Return to form? Absolutely not. Meandering and completely uninteresting, this has none of the attributes of the absolutely great ""Girlfriend"" or underrated ""Altered Beast."" Somebody should start a rumor similar to the ""Paul McCartney is dead"" speculation of the late '60s, because this doesn't even seem to be the same person who made some outstanding power pop in the early to mid '90s. If you like Matthew Sweet, avoid this; consider yourself warned."
4,By any other name would smell as sweet,"I keep hoping for something more like A.Beast, but I guess it ain't gonna happen. This is a good record but very few I've heard match the naked emotional intensity and pop sensibility of A.Beast."
2,buy Girlfriend and 100% Fun instead...,"Disappointing. Almost tragic. Only buy this if you already own Girlfriend and 100% Fun. They are life-changing; stupendous. This is ok. Side two is pretty strong, but side one is a let-down. ""I Should Never..."" may break through on FM. Still, he is great live, and one of the best of the '90s. But let me repeat: get Girlfriend and 100% Fun NOW!!!"
2,Where Did The Sharp Edge Of Matthew Sweets Music Gone To??,"I pre ordered this CD and I was so excited to get it on my door step yesterday. I am a passionate Matthew Sweet fan. I am sad to say that Sweet's sharp lyrics and music that his genius shines through on is missing on this CD. I was not looking for the same sound as in his other incredible recordings, but the originality is some what missing. It is slow and there is not one song that really stands out. I am sorry to not give more of a positive review."
4,A worthy entry in the Matthew Sweet catalog,"I bought this album when it first came out mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed ""Girlfriend"" and as a bassist, was thrilled to see the incomparable Carol Kaye listed as a player on several tracks. She does not disappoint. While not a perfect album, there are some incredible songs here, and as has been observed by many other reviewers, the production is dang near flawless. I would heartily recommend the opening ""suite"" - the first three songs which flow directly into one another, very reminiscent of Phil Spector. If anything, get the record just to hear Carol Kaye on ""If Time Permits"" and crank the bass up on your EQ - you HAVE to hear what's she's playing. She hasn't lost a step."
3,"Glad its here, but could be better","Being an avid freecell player on the computer I was excited when I saw the handheld version from RADICA being advertised. Having played a few games on it now, I feel the cards should be in red and black since it is hard to make out which is which. Also it would have been nice to view the entire line of cards in each row like you can on the computer instead of having to scroll up and down. Still I plan to keep it, since it is more challenging than the computer version because of its problems!!"
4,Nice but hard to see at times.,"I am an avid freecell player. Even bought a game for my palm pilot. This portable is very well constructed. It takes a bit of getting used to for the controls (especially since there were no instructions at all.)The only complaint I really have is the lack of the ability to adjust the LCD contrast. When I put batteries in it and hold it at a normal angle, I can see every segment lit up and it makes it difficult to see the cards that are supposed to be lit up.Other than that, not a bad little time waster.(...)"
2,Miss It...,"I had one of these games for 5 years and played it all the time in the evenings for relaxation. That one game lasted me 5 years. I ordered a new one when my other one wore out. I paid a very high price for it, but enjoyed playing the game so much I was willing to do that. However, I didn't have the game 24 hours and it broke. I ordered another one...after 2 days...it broke as well. I am not willing to pay high prices for something that doesn't last any time at all. I won't be ordering any more and I'm very sad because I MISS IT very much."
5,Great,"'Crystal Lake' is an excellent track; worth the 12 dollars for a serious Grandaddy fan. If you're new to the band, try The Sophtware Slump & Under the Western Freeway before getting a single."
1,Did not work,This product did not work in my VW Golf Manhatan 1996 1.8LBack clips were missing. Perharps these brake pads are for another VW
3,*zzzz*,"The songs are beautiful, but I don't like the occassional loud screach the wakes me up or snaps me out of a relaxed state. I think that's only in one of the first tracks b/c I haven't heard it since. It's unnecessary & quite annoying! However, this CD would be GREAT for background music as a setting for dinner or a get together. Tracks 5 & 6 have some really pretty ""ahh's"" that really do remind you of angels. I'd recommend this CD for casual background music, or to wind down from a busy day & to induce sleepiness. *yawn*"
1,No Turbo thrill,Yes what do I expect right? Not a whole bunch but having worked on a whole bunch of turbo's I expected to at least have the whirl a turbo makes as it decelerates and accelerates. this only became apparent if I rev very high. I did hope it would slightly lower my exhaust noise as it does divert the flow slightly. No such luck there either. The construction is good though but instructions for positioning or even installing were not included. It is possible a complete stock exhaust may be different.
1,bogus,"if you have a 3"" or bigger exhaust it wont make a sound air goes around it so I really dont know if it will work on standard pipe its price than better than speed shops"
1,SCAM DONT BUY,ITS A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND WILL DESTROY YOUR ENGINE..ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN IT WILL EITHER CREATE BACK PRESSURE AND DESTROY YOUR ENGINE CAUSE YOU TO HAVE TO REPLACE IT OR IT WILL FALL OFF YOUR MUFFLER CAUSING YOU TO LOSE MONEY EITHER WAY YOU ARE GONNA BE LOSING MONEY IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT
2,whistle,Save your $20 - I am not sure what noise this is trying to imitate but it sounds like a tea kettle.
4,Its ok.... But FAILS!,its a ok thing its only 20 dollars... it was worth it i put it on a nissan armada whioch is the nissan suv because nissan just released a turbocharger for the armada so i figured id see if i could scare any1... it was deliver eariler then planned... its way smaller then i thought it would be its only about 5 inches long... i havent had any1 rev my car up with me being outside but i had a buddy that was outside when i did it.. he said it was pretty loud. i could hear the whine a little bit but i was in the car with all the windows up.... not worth 100 dollars but im happy with spending 20 dollars..... and it fell off my car yesterday!!!!
1,"This is not a scam, you are just stupid.",Putting anything in your exhaust pipe so it sounds cool is about as smart as wearing tight jeans that barley fit because someone said they were in style.
4,Fake Turbo,Haven't installed it yet but will soon. It is much smaller than I expected but do hope it works well
2,waste of money,"to small for my vehicle, could not even here it , two days later it came of from my vehicle, not very happy............"
1,SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This item is a scam. I followed all the instruction but there was no change in the way the exhaust sounded like. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,nice,its ok if you dont want to spend a lot of money on a turbo it will give you the sound but not the sound when u change gears
1,scrap metal,Its was the dumbest thing in the world I got it think it was gunna sound sick doesn't even work...........waste of MONEY
5,awesome,This product is so cool. It sounds like the real thing. My bf thinks its the best thing since hubcap covers!
3,got a klugh?,"I bought this CD a couple of years ago after hearing Sean on a Windham Hill comp. The album has a nice mix of styles and he obviously has prime chops. Unfortunately, this CD reminds me much, too much of Earl Klugh's first two or three albums from the '70s: brilliant technique, accomplished versatility, but ultimately, forgettable. Debut projects showcasing an artist's range of talent often prove incoherent and distracting to me, hopefully his more recent offerings will be more focused."
3,alternative,"For those who like the idea of travel scrabble but have found this product lacking, I recommend the game UpWords. It does have slightly different rules, but is based on the same concept as Scrabble. The game board is plastic and will not bend, making it easy to pass around during play, and the tiles fit on the molded board securely so as not to slide and yet still be maneuverable."
2,"Convenient, but very difficult to use","The travel version of Scrabble is a great idea, but it broadly misses the mark on ease of use. The tiles do lock into place -- eventually! We constantly have to push some tiles back down and far too often one or more tiles will pop out of place when setting a new tile in place. We love to play Scrabble and, even with this version's drawbacks, it still rates four stars for fun and, of course, any version of Scrabble should receive five stars for educational value. It's durability remains in question -- we haven't used it that many times -- but it give me the feeling that game parts will start breaking relatively soon. Because of the problems noted above, I can't go beyond two stars in the overall rating. Sorry, Hasbro, but you ""misspelled"" this one. I just ordered a Deluxe Platinum Edition to replace this one. We want a version where the tiles lock in place, but the travel version isn't the one for us."
2,great idea but extremely frustrating,"We recently took the folio version with us to Italy and spend a lot of time crawling on our hands and knees (including in the plane!) looking for ""popped out"" tiles. Tiles are difficult to inserset, difficult to move around, pop out when you do not want them to, but are difficult to pop out when you want them to. How about a magnetic version? Was one ever made?"
4,Triple bonus score!,Love it love it love it! Played in the park and it everything worked as planned.A few suggestions: Bring a pencil sharpener or a pen. If one was included it would have been perfect.
3,Great concept - tiles POP out,"We love the format of this game and the snap in tiles are a great concept. We like to be able to start a game and put it away to finish later. BUT the tiles have a terrible habit of popping out. After we think we've placed them firmly, when we go to add tiles next to them they POP out. Makes it hard to take along for travel."
2,Not the best travel version of scrabble,"This is still a scrabble game, played like all others, but the design is not very good. The letters pop off the 'board' all too easily and by 'pop' I mean they go flying through the air. After playing several games my wife and I got better at placing the letters but some still took off. I can't imagine playing this in a car, letters are bound to get lost; ironically, this version was probably designed for in-car play. Anyone with hand problems should avoid this game, the letters are small and good dexterity is essential for placing the letters.On the plus side you can stop mid-game, fold everything up, go somplace else and resume where you left off.I much preferred an older travel version which I gave away to a friend. It folded in half and was made out of light blue plastic."
4,Great Game in a Travel Package,"My girlfriend and I have become Scrabble addicts but found traveling with the game a hassle. This looked like the perfect solution and for the most part it has been. Though a little small for my taste, that is what makes it so portable. The tiles lock on the board and the whole thing folds into its own carrying case, the tile holders close and lock into place so you can stop and continue at any time. The only real negative we found is that after several games some of the tiles no longer lock into the board which is annoying but not insurmountable. If you travel alot this is a great way to pass the hours at the airport or on the plane."
1,scrabble folio,"I purchased this one because of the neat case. I have the old travel scrabble with the wooden letters. I really like the old travel scrabble. This new one, I gave it away. As was mentioned too much of a hassle messing with the pop out letters."
5,No Pop Ups!!,"I think this is a great edition of travel scrabble. I have played it at the beach and in flight. The tiles stay where you put them. The tiles don't pop up unless you use a heavy hand in putting them in the grid. If you are a bit gentle and careful, none of the tiles move at all. Great design, wonderful convience and lots of fun anywhere you want!"
4,"Great, except small pieces","We love this set. My only complaint is that the pieces are very small. I have small fingers and I find it hard to handle at times. I think this would be hard to use at the beach or on the plane. We also had to rub each piece on all four sides at first b/c they wouldn't stay on the board next to other pieces. It only took a few minutes though, and all the pieces fit now! So if you have that problem, just take a regular emory board and file each piece on four sides a few times. This will wear down the edges just enough to make sure they don't pop out."
4,Portable fun,"We love our new Folio Scrabble! We took it to Starbucks and played a half a game and when it was time to leave, we just packed it up and off we went. The portability is nice. I do agree with the other reviews as far as the size of the tiles - they are tiny. It is also a bit difficult to take the tiles off the board because they are pretty much set in there when you click them on. Otherwise, it is perfect to take with you anywhere."
2,little too small,"I was stoked to get this, it was a great idea, but poorly executed. The plastic is too tiny and tight, making it hard to pop in the letters, which occasionally shoot off the gameboard. The racks are worthless, the pieces don't even fit in two of mine. I don't know if my set was defective, but it seems to me that they went a little too cheap on the plastic"
1,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"Scrabble is one of my favorite games, but I really am not impressed with the quality of this travel edition. The board refuses to lie flat, making it nearly impossible to stick letters in the rows bordering the hinges. The letters are difficult to pop into their spaces on the board. The racks, for some absurd reason, have 7 individual slots in them, so shuffling tiles is a near impossibility.This is highly unimpressive. If I want a word game when I'm traveling, I like the Quickwords travel edition MUCH more than this. I love Scrabble, but I'll leave it at home until they come up with a better travel edition."
5,this is the cutest little travel game,"Comes with the same number of tiles as the full-sized game, but perfect to take on trips or to the park! Plus, the tiles snap in, so you can fold up a game in progress. Pick up a pocket dictionary to keep with it for answering challenges."
4,commendable!,Very handy. The tiles stayed in place on the board. The racks can easily be tucked inside the case. It is jusrt as I had expected.
4,great for travel,This was perfect for playing on a long flight. My only complaint would be the letters can be a little hard to get out of the board. But size it great for fitting on the airplane pull down tray. The letter trays are a must for bumpy flights.
2,"If the tiles would go into the squares, it would be great","I love Scrabble. My parents taught me to play when I was 12 (many, many years ago) and I've loved it ever since. My husband and I bought this version of the game so we could take it on the road with us. And, it would be great except that it's almost impossible to get the tiles into the squares. They pop out frequently when you are trying to put them in. My parents have a travel version where you can just lay the tiles in the squares. Why did they change it?"
1,Close but no cigar,Scale arrived quickly as promised and initially provided consistant readings little or no variation when taken 2-4 times in a row. Checked it against the Dr.'s office and it was the same (they had just had theirs calibrated). Then after a couple of weeks - started to get readings that were as much as one pound apart and had a couple of instances where it read 0.4 or 0.6 on start up. Have called customer service and am awaiting a call back.Tanita HD372 Pure Geometry Glass Digital Lithium Scale
1,Neither Accurate or Precise,"I brought this scale so I could read the meter w/o glasses, and because it looked good. However, with some use it became apparent either the scale or my body wasn't functioning propoerly. I have access to calibrated weights, and found that after weighing a 50.0 lb weight multiple times over different days, that it was the scale wasn't working. The weight had values ranging between 50.4 to 52 lbs, an error of 1-4%. Given that my diet was calling for a loss of 2 lbs a week, that was an unacceptable error. What was worst was that the scale's precision was terrible. One day yielded 5 straight readings of 51.0 lbs. The following day yielded 50.4. The day after that returned mixed results of 50.4 (2x) and 51.8 (3x). Thinking that perhaps an uneven floor may be causing problems, I carefully placed the in a set spot, and repeated the tests. One day saw values of 50.4 lbs, and the next saw 52-51.8 lbs. At this point I gave up. Avoid this scale."
2,Hmm,This scale is very pretty.Not the most accurate scale I've stood on ( and I've stood on a few!) You can stand on it twice within a minute and get results 1 - 1.2 pounds out from the previous reading.Not impressed!
1,Save Your Money,This scale is incredibly inaccurate and inconsistent. I can stand on the scale and weigh myself. Take a shower and be 3 pounds lighter. Save your money and buy something else.
4,Great scale,"A good scale. You tap the scale with your foot to turn it on, step on the scale, and in a couple seconds you have your weight. Of course the weight only stays up a few seconds before shutting down. Nice looking and easy to clean. Very stable with rubber feet."
4,Great purchase!,"I love this scale! It is very attractive. And seemingly accurate. The only complaint I have is that you have to kind of tap on it first to get the display to ""wake up"" then when it hits 0.00, you get on. It's not a big deal, just a minor little thing. I would still recommend it!"
1,Terribly erratic,This scale is very erratic. You cannot get an accurate reading. Even if you step on it numerous times it will never give to the same reading with up to a 20 lb. difference. After you step off it will flash the weight so quickly that you don't have time to read it. Then it switches from lbs to metric and bounces around until there is just a plain blue screen. To bad it does not work properly-it is a nice looking scale.
1,Didn't work,"The scale was DOA; it simply didn't work. We called Tanita to find out if we were doing something wrong, they couldn't offer anything but ""return it to the seller."" Too bad. It looked nice."
1,Very pretty but doesn't work!,"I ordered this for my diabetic mother who has to watch her weight. Not only did this scale not work, but it's difficult to use- tap *just* right, then get on, etc. Bottom line- nice aesthetics, but unreliable."
4,Classy looks and accurate readings,"Wow, I am surprised by all the negative reviews!I love this scale. It looks great and has always given me an accurate and consistent reading. It's nice to be able to see your weight fluctuations to two-tenths of a pound. This is the best scale I've owned.The only downside to this scale (and the reason iI'm giving 4 stars, not 5) is that you have to tap it with your foot first and wait several seconds before you can step on it. Sometimes I wish I could just hop right on, but the wait is short so it's not terribly annoying."
1,2 Defective units!,"I am currently sending back my second defective Tanita HD372 scale. The first scale was wildly inaccurate to the measure of 30-80lbs and this scale reads nothing but errors and will not reset itself. I have another Tanita scale that works great I am highly disappointed that this model is defective. I would not waste your time ordering this scale, to many defective reviews. I should have listened and not wasted my time."
2,Not so hot,"It frequently fails to zero saying Err then you have to try again and again sometimes up to seven times to get it to work.It also varies by 1-3lbs every time I use it, even if I don't move it, regardless of if I re-zero between uses. Sometimes it's off by over 100lbs. It gets REALLY wacky if you don't stand with your weight perfectly in the middle every time, say leaning forward slightly to look down. I've resorted to just weighing 3 times in a row an averaging it.Sometimes it will just turn on and then not turn off, other times it refuses to turn on."
1,Junk,This scale is a waste of your money. It is difficult to turn on and delivers inconsistent weights. In addition it quit working altogether after 6 months.
2,Inconsistent Readings,"We've had this scale for over a year. My son (~115 lb) has been using it for the last several months and we've found that it has not been consistent, especially in the past few weeks. Even when placed on a very hard tile floor, rather than a linoleum floor, the readings vary by as much as 2 lb with repeated measurements, depending on the ""mood"" of the scale."
4,HD372 Tanita Scale,"I needed a scale that was accurate and easy to read. This Tanita scale is great. I weighed myself three times in a roll, and received the exact weight each time. Weight is shown in pounds and ounces. Amazon.com makes it easy to order from, no tax and shipping cost is a big plus!! I have bought severial different brands of scales in the past, all were worthless, not accurate and broke in a short time of use. I have a friend that purchased a Tanita scales and is very pleased. In fact he was the one that advised me to buy a Tanita Scale. It was good advise, i'm glad I took it."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,"I bought this scale based on the positive reviews, thinking I could cope with any problems mentioned by the negative reviews. I was wrong. First let me say that on rare occasion the scale does work and I would be quite satisfied if it continued to do so. However, I often get a ""Lo"" message, meaning the lithium battery is low. I tried a new battery and still get the message. The message will go away if you pick up the scale and press on the battery. Assuming you get by the ""Lo"" message the scale lights up with a tap and ""00.0"" appears. Then you step on the scale and wait a few seconds for your weight to appear. If the ""00.0"" appears in dark letters there is a good chance that your weight will subsequently be shown. 19 out of 20 times nothing at all appears. I just want to step on a scale and get my weight. I cannot do that with this scale."
4,Mine worked fine.,"I must say that I bought this scale with some trepidation, based on some of the lukewarm reviews. I am pleased to report that my scale has been working flawlessly for the past two months. I like the big illuminated numbers that I can read with out my glasses in the morning. The accuracy and reproducibly if the readings is is very good from reading to reading. I would recommend this scale for anyone on a serious weight loss regimen."
4,"Blanc, Despain, Catlin...WHO?","I don't know what C.Blanc, R.O. Despain, and Alan C.Catlin think they are doing with their reviews ofEickhoff's work, But their reviews remind me ofsomeone who is a wannabe reviewer and doesn't have theintellectual capacity to be one. Unfortunately,comments like these idiots are unwarranted. THE QUICKAND THE DEAD is a wonderful read and, from others withwhom I have shared the work, seamless and flawless.Several other reviews have praised Eickhoff for hisaccuracy and truthfulness as a storyteller. Blanc,Despain, and Catlin appear to be looking for works todenigrate through their stupidity"
2,Somewhat dissapointed,"I must admit that I bought the CD for the title track and was somewhat dissapointed with the rest of the album. I do realise however that it was recorded in the '80's, it really sounded like it too!"
4,A great applicable read,What a phenomenal book. The authors give helpful and applicable information in an easy read format. The book really works as my daughter is living proof. I have raised her with the whole Babywise system and she is a wonderful girl. The book gives good ideas and problem solving tips. I like the structure but yet the flexibility of the program. A must read for anyone with kids or planning on having kids.
1,Un Wise,"Gary Ezzo is not qualified to give childcare advice. He has been discredited over and over, and dropped by his publishser. He continues to publish these on his own. Look up Gary Ezzo on the internet for the critiques of this material. Don't do this to your child!"
5,A book out of our Past!,"38 years ago, we were on sabbatical in Europe, and Little Cabbages was one of the books we discovered in a book store either in Luxembourg or Paris. We haven't opened this copy yet, but we had lots of laughs when we read it the first time, and we expect the same reaction these many years later. It says something when a purely for fun book is still remembered fondly after 38 years."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was looking forward to relaxing piano, but could not listen to most of these songs all the way through. If you LOVE drum brushes in the background of your music, this is the CD for you! The selections are long and although they start out with Lori Line""s beautiful piano playing, I could not enjoy listening as I was anticipating the arrival of the drum brushes as well as other instruments that pushed the piano to the background. This CD and Crazy arrived today and are boxed up and will be returned tomorrow."
5,Great Collectable For Kids Of All Ages,"Harry Potter Hogwarts School Deluxe Electronic PlaysetI am over 50 years old and a Harry Potter fan as well as a collector. I bought this Hogwart's playset used without instructions, but I absolutely love it. Just looking at it as a display brings back memories of the Harry Potter movie and I love Hogwarts so I am quite happy with playset. I have also collected the other Harry Potter playsets to go along with Hogwarts and I do recommend it to people of all ages."
4,The Way It Works,"Well, I have played with this toy...may sound funny. But it was very fun! So I think it is very fun! I don't think this toy has much education at all! I think if you mean iformation on Harry Potter it gives alot! But deffintily nothing you may need in life as you grow up. I guess this toy IS durable. I am not to sturdy on that quesion, though. All in all this is a GREAt toy to get your kids this Christmas! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
2,Hogwarts School.......a little novelty,"This is a great item to buy, as a novelty Harry Potter collection. Cool look, and neat interior. But....this is not a child's toy. It held our child's (age ten) attention about five minutes as a toy. The wrapping takes about 45 minutes to take the School from the box. By then all enthusiasm for it, is gone. A rating of two stars is about all it's worth as a child's beloved toy,but as a novelty it's okay."
2,A Huge Disappointment!,"Much smaller and dinkier that one might imagine. The miniscule figures are easily lost both inside and outside the playset. Mattel's most glaring design flaw is failing to magnetize the bottoms of the figures and the barely-indented spaces on which they are made to fit (in order for the barely-discernable ""actions"" to take place). The figures keep toppling off which is very frustrating when you are trying to make one ""disappear"". We also found the playset difficult to open and close. Considering the big price I really expected something cooler to happen. I guess this doesn't matter now since all the figures have been lost."
1,A BORING TOY,I boght this thinking I'd really enjoy it.But after 2 nights it got boring.The little people get stuck inside the castle.But it's a great collecters itam.
3,An Expensive toy that looks fun but doesnt have fun for long,I bought this toy with alot of Toys R Us gift cards from Christmas. I was expecting some big thing but it is acctually quite small. It isn't fun for long but it does last for 2 hours
3,A Fun Novelty....not a lot of Fun.,"This is a great piece to look at and observe for the first few times....a lot like getting a new mechanical music box. The ""screaming book"", ""levitating feather"", ""flying owl"", etc. are very minimal in effect - both visually and with their sounds.My biggest problem is that the rooms need to be larger. There is room for little more than the character(s) to be planted in their slots.Beautiful to look at, magical to find all the (disappointing) special effects, yet not enough space for the very small characters to move about."
5,Hogwarts school now whith you,That's the dream of any child in the world!!! Now you can create your one adventures!!!!
5,I loved this toy!,"I'm a seven-year old boy and I love this toy. I played with it all day on Christmas. I like putting Snape up on top of the owlry and making it pop up! I noticed that if you put a table in Professor Flitwick's classroom, close it, and open it again, the table will be gone. It has gone down into the base of Hogwarts. Its electric and takes three double-A batteries. The people are very small and might get lost. Its really hard to get it out of its box."
4,Still Fun despite losing the figures,"My boys, ages 6 and 5, absolutely love the Harry Potter series and begged me to get them this toy for Christmas. It really is very neat with all of the different, intrinsically designed rooms and the sounds (they especially like the library's ""restricted"" section). The only Catch-22 are the figures. They are very tiny, perhaps so for small hands, however, because of their size children are sure to lose them. I think we only have the invisible Harry left and the others are in the depths of my couch somewhere. Despite this however, my boys STILL play with this toy and engage in lots of imaginary play with it. They have the Weasley house attachment and play with the toy regardless if the house is attached or not. I'm sure any child of any age would love this toy. It's fun, it travels well, and it really encourages children's imagination. A definite thumbs up!"
4,Hogwarts School Playset,"This toy has several benefits if you are a Harry Potter fan. Although the small pieces are a concern for younger children, it is a durable, creative toy for children and adults. When connected with the other playsets: Whomping Willow, Hagrid's Hut, Platform 9 3/4, etc., it provides great entertainment and allows children to recreate scenes from the movie and create new adventures for Harry Potter and all the major characters. This playset also powers the others so it is a vital purchase if you want to animate the others. If you have a ""wizard in training"" it is well worth the money."
4,WE Need More From Benny,We need the record companies (New Birt-Sony Records) to make all of Bennies past recordings available. The man was BADDDDDDD!I am hoping that others read this and join me in calling for more Benny Cummings Music!
5,Purchasing used books,Level of the book's condition was as described. Delivery time was excellent. Mailer packaging was secure and safe.
2,"Lessons won't load, no support","I recently researched voice programs for my 10 year old daughter. This program came highly recommended. My daughter is very visual and learns quickly when she uses visual aids. Being able to watch a voice track would be perfect for her. I purchased this software new unopened, and installed it by the directions. We went through the setup, everything was fine. We tried to open the lessons section of the software and nothing happens. I went to the ""carry a tune"" website for assistance. They do not support version 2.0 and recommend that you deal with the people you purchased it from. All I could find was version 2.0 and Unlimited. They offer an upgrade to Unlimited. If this version isn't supported and doesn't work, why would I upgrade? A new version will not be available until 2011. If you feel like you will need the lessons part of this software I would not recommend it. If you have any problems your on your own. Buy at your own risk."
1,Hasn't worked on Windows for years. Discontinued and unsupported.,"The software doesn't install, the company doesn't answer emails, the website no longer sells this version or any other version. If you enjoy placing and returning orders, this product is for you. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,Can't get support,"This product appears to have real value in it. The parts of the software that I can get to work have the potential to be great tools for improving your singing. Unfortunately, the meat of the product, the singing lessons, will not run on my computer and I have been unsuccessful at getting technical support for the product. Over the past week, I have sent emails and called durring business hours. No one was present to answer my calls and never returned the emails of voice messsages I left. At this point I intend to return the software."
1,may not install,"I've spent over 3 hours trying to get this to install, so if you order this be aware you may also encounter problems.Their tech support admits to seeing these problems before but they send me to Norton anti-virus for tech support, even though there is no evidence that Norton is interfering. For instance, turning Norton completely off does not fix the problem. Norton tech support was nice enough to thoroughly check things and they found no problem.I'm returning the software -- it is useless to me."
2,Singing Lessons part doesn't work!!,"I agree with the 2 latest posts, the Singing lessons area (the only area of the program I'm interested in) doesn't work. AT ALL...it you click on it from any of the many links available to go to that section and nothing happens. I will try running it on an earlier version of windows (in a virtual drive) to see if that works tonight if it doesn't work I am returning it to the store tomorrow morning. I would have been a great application. I know it's pretty old...but..that is my bad for not checking the copyright date on the box which clearly states 1997-2004...I should've know the software was old...but it did say it worked with Windows XP. DON'T BUY THIS. I've been learning to sing with Brett Manning's Singing success..and it's definitley working...I fell for this application because I thought it would help me sing on pitch. Or help me read sheet music."
3,Didn't completely work,"I knew the singing part of the product, because I had seen it on a friend's computer. The singing part worked well and was easy to understand and use. But I could not get the lessons working. My computer would freeze up every time I selected the ""lesson"" button. I thought it was the software, but when I returned it the seller said it worked fine, so something in my computer just didn't ""compute"". I would like to try the ultimate version because there are more songs, but I am afraid it would not completely work either."
4,Great Fun,"I purchased the Singing Coach just after Christmas....decided to give myself a present. I have found it to be very useful in helping me focus on note accuracy as well as timing. I was a little concerned about ordering after reading a few of the reviews with their problems but now I realize they were probably the operators fault,ie: 1)does not always record a line on the graph when you sing.....make sure the earphone/mouthpiece plugs are all the way plugged into the computer,etc. I do agree that a few more pieces of music would have been nice but overall, it has a lot of options to try different things. I would recommend this product to anyone - even those that have sung for years can have fun with it."
2,Definitely for beginners/children,The format of this software was very childish. My father was insulted by my purchase of this once he opened it. It is formatted for people who have no ability to sing. This would be great for children/teens who want to learn how to sing. Definitely NOT for adults.
1,chicago meets dave mathews,this is a band from york pa the same home as the band live..this cd features curtis roberts on vocals and was produced 1997..it contains songs by talented musician and key board vertuoso george christ who has gone on to a career in medicine..
1,MISINFORMED CATHOLICS,"FYI: Karl Rahner is NOT considered a great theologian or thinker in the Catholic Church. He is considered a new age thinker these days. In his day he was one who desseminated from Catholic teaching. What many Catholics like about the Catholic Church is it does not change with society but stays pure to Christ's and church's teaching. Karl Rahner does not. And is considered by the church to have caused confusion and problems with seminarians. Who knows maybe the current scandals of the church are even a result of his let me go my own way and do my own thing attitude. Whatever it is, it's not catholic. Beware. It sounds good, but be careful where it leads you. Just like all pride and sin."
4,Quick Take Off in Latin American Spanish,"This set provides a good review of Latin American Spanish for tourists. I have the French and Italian sets from the same series, and this one is, unfortunately, definitely inferior to those. I was a bit disappointed in this one, but it is adequate and handy. I cannot think of a better course in such a small, convenient package."
5,"Unleashed, only the beginning","""Unleashed"" is a fantastic book about the life of Tina Resch and Dr. William Roll. It is the type of book you will read in one day. It is that compelling. It is the story of poltergeist activity and how it affected Tina's life. Dr. Roll came in to study the phenomenon and Tina. The events he and others witnessed were amazing. Even more amazing is what happened to Tina years later. You see, Tina, now known as Christina Boyer, is serving a life sentence for the murder of her baby, a crime she did not commit. The actual murderer confessed and received a lighter sentence than the plea ""bargain"" arranged by her public defender. After reading this book, you will come away amazed at the extraordinary events of her life from the poltergeist manifeststions that cannot be explained to the life sentence that cannot be explained. This is a must read for anyone interested in the paranormal."
5,Comments on Unleashed by Roll and Storey,"Besides the intriguing detailed accounts of poltergeist activity by a leading expert, this book of facts is as engaging as any mystery novel that I have ever read. I mistook it for a bedtime story but it kept me awake until I finished it. I also have a personal interest in this book because I witnessed one of the paranormal events that occured at Spring Creek Institute. I saw the 12-inch wrench fly down the hall, turn the corner and hit the wall where I was working. The walls of the lab are glass from mid-way up to the ceiling."
1,Pure hokum,"The author is making a career by trying to pass off as true a case that has been proven a hoax, like all supernatural phenomena. See here:http://tinyurl.com/3457k"
3,Nice try,"The best part of this book are the two lists of Chivalrous and Romantic duties, taken from real medival litterature.There are some nice adventures, too - the monster in one of them will be amusing for those who have played a certain horror game, and the murder mystery is a nice change of pace (though the main villain would not use those kind of methods, i think). The marrige adventure seed looks like its worth developing, too.Still and all, this is just not a classic. It lacks the finishing touches and, worse, feeling of being part of a greater secret whole that makes a proper Pendragon game.It is NOT the first book you should buy after the rulebook. However, if your Pendragon libary is otherwise complete, its worth a look."
2,Not as good as I thought...,"This video contains small parts of some of Mary J. Blige videos and Mariah Carey videos. The quality is not as good as a columbia release and the make it or break it phone number appears all the time on the screen. Contains very little clips on ""Sweetheart"" video, ""Joy to the world"", ""My all"", ""Honey""... and more... but once again there are only SMALL PARTS and NOT the entire video!"
3,Rare specimen...?,"Well in my opinion this video is like a rare specimen, I bought this video only because it was about Mariah but when I had it in my hands I noticed that it was not from ""columbia"", dissapointed I went to my room to watch it and I got to the conclusion that this video was not to bad but it wasn't good. I've been thinking about the video and in my conclusion you can't compare Mary J. Blige with a singer of the current proportions Mariah has. I recomend you to buy it only if you're crazy for Mariah...like me."
5,GREAT QUALITY PAINTS...,"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HIGH QUALITY, AND BE A PERFECT IDEA FOR FINISH A CAR MODEL OR OTHER MODEL WHO NEED A METALLIC PAINT..."
4,Attractive Price,"I bought this for 19.99 at Staples yesterday. Did not buy the base station to see whether it will register with VOIP321 set that i already had..paid $120+ for just one handset. I was very happy to see that this registered with the VOIP321 dect base station as well...and for 19.99 it was a steal. Granted the screen is small and hard to read but hey you get what you pay for...other dect handsets are in the $99 range!by the way..sound quality, battery life, design(no jutting antanae), size is just awesone!"
2,Stylish but way too small for regular use,"I've been looking for this style of phone for a while, looks great, works great but it's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use. It's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my Samsung SPH-A900. When the Samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone. I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home. If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women. Also it does not have any plugs for headsets. I am returning mine to Amazon."
2,"Kind of fun, but ultimately disappointing","I expected a lot more from this book than I got. I myself have seen much weirder lawns than are included in this book. It sometimes appears to be more of a comment on class-driven levels of taste than on personal weirdness and eccentricity, and I didn't like that. Interesting to browse, but not worth the price, in my opinion. For this type of book, ""Weird Rooms"" is much better."
2,"Skimpy on content, repetitive photos","This is a tiny little book of seven inches by six inches and only 112 pages. Completely overpriced. Content is fairly generic and featured yards are not as whimsical as the title would imply. Most annoying, there is too much repetition of photos being double printed on subsequent pages. If you are looking for fun ideas for your own wacky garden, you would get better ideas from ten minutes of web searching. I regret this purchase."
1,No action figures!,"The balcony falls off every time you touch it. The Droid Factory makes no sense ... because there are no droids. This thing is just the arena, with no action figures. Where can you find every character from the film now, months after it left the theaters? Where can you get 3' tall figures? Beats me, so my son has yet to be able to play with this thing."
2,Shockingly Disappointing,"I'm very optimistic about an artist's work and I'm not quick to judge anybodys work as disappointing unless it's just that. Being that Mr.Ware produced and co-wrote one of the greatest albums of all time(I Want You). I was definitely eager to hear him do his own work. Although the writing is pretty good on the album, the songs just dont seem to jump out at you. There is not much to it that would makes you want to hear it again and again, and I'm a huge fan of of 70's soul. Maybe that is what Motown thought also, maybe they thought fans would rather spend their last on a sandwich. Which is maybe the reason Mr.ware didn't get the support for this album that he believed he deserved. I still honor him for his genius as a writer particularly with the work he's done with Marvin and Minnie Riperton."
3,Not What I Expected,"Being the consummate Marvin Gaye fan that I am, I felt that I eventually had to pick up this release by Leon Ware. After I read the liner notes, however, I couldn't shake the feeling that Mr. Ware apparently had a point to make or a bone to pick (""I wrote those songs for myself and didn't want to give them to Marvin so now I'M gonna do them!""). While I think that Mr. Ware is a wonderful songwriter, I really don't care for his voice. Nor do I care for his versions of the songs (albeit his own) that Marvin burned into my psyche when he so masterfully and sensuously performed them on his ""I Want You"" album. For me no one will ever be able to do them like Marvin. The Minnie Riperton duets were a nice touch."
5,A Forgotten Singer,"The only thing people probably remember about O.C. Smith is his lone top five Gold seller, ""Little Green Apples"". Another song on here made the top forty in ""The Son of HIckory Holler's Tramp"", but it should have done better than just peaking at the top forty position. Other good songs on here include ""Wichita Lineman"", ""Baby I Need Your Loving"", and ""Me and You"". Great songs and great singer!"
5,Funk Rock,"Released in December of 2003, 195i is a solid first effort. A nice blend of funk and alternative, the album features straight-ahead rock, slow-tempo grooves, and a little acoustic balladry. A video was released for Just Another Ending. Other album highlights include Infected, Right Of Passage, and Gone So Long. In July of 2004 Jabudah released the 3 song Dead Fly EP.Jabudah hail from Simi Valley, California. Stylistically, Jabudah could be compared to 311 and Incubus. Jabudah has opened for such acts as: George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Jack Johnson, G. Love and Special Sauce, The Aquabats, and War."
1,Totally lame,"These things are tiny. I mean really tiny. The advertisement on Amazon makes it look like these might work with any dollhouse. believe me, they do not; they are really tiny. Maybe worth about $0.50."
1,"Dull, Dry, Disappointing.","It seems that putting out a Selected Poems of some type is currently en vogue. Witness the fact there are suddenly Selected Poems out from poets who have only 2 or 3 books. Rachel Hadas has numerous books of poetry, and seeing a selection from all of them leaves me wondering how on earth she has published so much. The poems are as dry and as dull as they come. Her use of meter is so thudding it gives one a headache. She isn't artful, clever, or moving. Her poems are rarely ever surprising. A few of the early poems showed promise, but Hadas hasn't lived up to that promise. She, like many poets in her generation, is living on her name and her false reputation. This is the work of someone entrenched in the poetry ""industry"" and not the work of a poet. A disappointing selection of poems."
4,"Lacks invention, but strong on style and message.","Personnaly, I find the poetry in this book to be very powerful, if not as technically appealing as some of the other contemporary poets of the day. Her meter is slightly over done, but the rhythm that is established, powers the poem along to its conclusion. Her imagery and use of such literary tricks as consonance and assonance never fails to intrigue and delight me. It is a successful, though not triumphant work which deserves reading, and becomes more compelling once it is dissected for its technical style."
4,Go home to this,"Underrated-and-appreciated, finely fused, jacked up jazz splendor abound, whole enough on this original four track version."
4,funny and kooky,It's a great zombie movie with a lot of flair and some transgender issues. Really fun and has a drinking game in the special features.
5,"Punk Rock, Zombies, Oh yes","I've seen some of the reviews on here saying this movie was dumb. Well, maybe it could be. But that is like saying a Mercedes is dumb. It's only dumb if you can't afford it but it's great for the people who love themSame thing here. If you like The Ramones, Romero's Living Dead series, and the goofy like FX of Very Strange Video, you'll love it.I've watched this movie probably 30 times. It's funny, and all around I liked it. It may not be for everyone. But I did want to make a reveiw showing the truth and not some wannabee film critic who has never made a movie in his life.The Truth is simple, if you're into the somewhat odd, funny, B grade horror movies that are both funny, cheesy, and full of zombies, and you enjoy The Ramones or even the Misfits, well, BUY THIS, YOU'LL LOVE IT.If you are more into serious movies, then don't."
4,"Wild, indeed","Wild Zero is a Japanese movie featuring music group Guitar Wolf, who is also the singer of the band. I started watching this movioe twice but only made it in about 20 minutes before I turned it off and gave up. A friend urged me to give it one more shot and I did and fell in love with it. So if you watch it, give it more than 20 minutes, it becomes really funny/interesting/cool.Wild Zero is kind of like Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park combined with a Japanese version of The Ramones stuck in a Zombies From Outter Space story. Yes, it's quite a combo. Oh and throw in a love story, some renegade gang members, and a club owner with really short-shorts and you've got it. I love the music in this film, Guitar Wolf rocks. The movie is just crazy and twisted but after watching the whole thing I'm a huge fan. If you like insane-silly movies with lots of action and believe that THERE ARE NO BOUNDRIES IN ROCK AND ROLL check this out."
2,A Zombie Movie even a Zombie fan does not like,"Let me begin by saying I LOVE Zombie movies and Guitar Wolf is a pretty Bad Ass band, at least persona and attitude wise. I have a huge collection of over 50. Out of all of them Wild Zero and Tokyo Zombie are by far the two worst. Unlike Tokyo Zombie, Wild Zero does have a few moments. Honestly, it is a must have for a zombie collection, because there's no other movie like it. But just know that it is very crappy, low quality and just plain stupid."
2,Not my type of movie,"Only one word describes this movies and its "" CHEESE "".1- Two zombies fall in love, 2-when people are near zombies, the zombies seem to just walk around them doing nothing in most scenes, 3-these guys are like 80's chinese cheese balls, I love the 80's but the japanese made a new style movie but it seems like they are stuck in the 80's walking around yelling "" ROCK AND ROLL "" lol just stupid as hell. 4- Also all the gore is animated which i didnt like at all. If you want a good Zombie flick check out Junk or even Versus ( both Japanese cinema ), i would advise Junk its an excellent movie. Versus just drags to much but is still more fun than wild zero, which I will never watch again."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after having learnt 'Don't Think Twice' from a magazine and was very disappointed with the transcriptions. 'Don't think twice' was a very poor representation; even a average guitarist would be able to see it was quite far off the recorded version. Another problem was the lack of good songs - Fantasic fingerpicking pieces were missed out:'Spanish Boots', 'Girl from north country', 'One too many mornings', etc did not feature. Also no words were included."
1,Bosch Cabin air filter,This Bosch cabin filter product required difficult cutting and trimming to force a fit into the tray of the vehicle it was stated to be intended for. I would not recommend Bosch cabin filter if you have an expectation that they fit specific cars.
1,Junk,Was expecting this brand name to be quality and value. It was pure junk. Poor fit and poor quality. It installed easily but I doubt it is filtering due to its poor fit. Honda Crosstour.
4,Cheap and good cabin filter,"For a Bosch filter, the price and quality is good. No sharp corners and thickness of the filter is good - Not those low grade paper."
3,"Good, but not great.","I purchased this filter for my 04 TSX, the filter itself looks and feels very cheap compared to the OEM, but it does get the job done. You smell you are getting clean air when brand new, I just don't think this will last more than 5K miles. IMO, there are better options out there, FRAM and WIX have great filters for a couple of more bucks."
4,Works as it should...reasonably priced,"Much cheaper than dealer, few bucks cheaper than automotive store...would buy again for the same pricedid improve my air circulation for sure"
4,Cabin Air Filter,What is there to say about a cabin air filter except it was easy to replace on a Honda Accord. It was even easier to replace than the engine air filter.
2,STINKS LITERALLY,"This came quickly and fit perfectly, but it stinks like old rubber and it leaves my truck and my hands smelling like aged gasoline."
4,WAY too much $$$$,"Unless you are in dire, immediate need for this, I would not recommend buying this particular item here. I literally just HAPPENED to buy this in my local Stop & Shop grocery store for $2.99. Yes, I triple-checked and it's the EXACT same item and size - 4.4 lbs. The product is good but the price is terrible!"
1,not gluten free,"Yes, the tortillas were tasty, but the product is cross-contaminated with gluten. The labeling is very deceiving! It says: ""corn, a gluten free food"" on the label, but they blew it by using dirty equipment."
1,Jejune.,"Well, there's got to be some good use for this DVD. You certainly don't want to watch it. I can't beleive I paid good money for this thing.No sensible plot, dialogue, acting... It's bad through and through.Ahhh! Yes, it's just occurred to me... I will use this to press out hamburgers. At least they are not quite so lacking in nutritive value.For the love of God, stay away from this travesty."
1,POINTLESS INSULT,"THE JUDAS PROJECT? Where did they come up with the title for this pointless, painfully insulting movie? It posits the idea ""What if Jesus came today?"" However, in doing so, it offers nothing new or original and makes mockery of the actual coming of Jesus. It ignores the Last Supper, the Virgin Birth, and insults Christian's intelligence with its pandering psychobabble. The acting is atrocious, the special effects mundane and the musical score is banal and uninspiring. Their decision to make God vengeful and unforgiving at the Crucifixion is unforgivable. I don't know what the movie makers intended but this is one piece of trash that should never have made it to celluloid. Avoid, avoid!!!"
2,Mish Mash,"I had high hopes for this movie, as I have often wondered that if I lived in a contemporary time with Jesus, would I have believed Him? However, this movie was pretty terrible. It quoted a lot of Scripture, which was pretty accurate, but it lacked direction and just seemed weird. The cover of the DVD was misleading also, showing ""Jesus"" in blue jeans with helicopters hovering about in front of a city skyline. The whole movie looks like it was filmed in the 1980s and takes place in a Cape-Cod type setting. I ended up forwarding through most of it, watching the miracles and then the crucifixion. The end was weird too, with no showing of the Resurrection, etc. I'm just glad this was a bargain bin purchase..."
4,Perfect bike for around the neighborhood!,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it!A little hard to put together, if you are not bike smart (like us). It took us about an hour. But, it is a very nice looking bike and rides great. Overall, it is a great buy."
2,You get what you pay for...,"If all you need this bike is to go to the corner market and back, then it's a great bargain. I bought for ocassional exercise (nothing extreme- just street riding of up to 5 miles roundtrip). The bike broke down after 2 months of use. I never abused it. It will likely cost me about half of what I paid for in order to fix it. I am 5'10"" and weigh 200 lbs. Perhaps, I am too big for this bike but with a name like Schwinn, well, you expect better..."
2,TERRIBLE ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!,"I am not the handiest person in the world. However, with a decent instruction manual, I can almost always work my way through it. Unfortunaely, the instruction manual to this bike is absoultely BIZZARE!!!As a result, I have to pay $67 to have this bike assembled by the thieves at the bike shop down the street.Unless, you have a mechnical engineering degree from MIT or Cal Tech, add the cost of assembly to the total price."
4,Great perspective,I really enjoyed this book because it gives you a different perspective on how society views girls like Daphnie. You can see it from her perspective and how she is treated. Definitely worth reading. Short book too!
3,Worth the read,"I enjoyed this book. I only give it three stars because it did get a bit redundant towards the end, thus boring me a bit, but it's an excellent read for anyone who has suffered through the trials of being trapped in mental health ""treatment.""I also felt that somewhere along the course of the book, the author lost her passion for telling the story. The descriptions became vague, there wasn't as much life breathed into the storytelling.HOWEVER, Daphne has all of my respect. She seems to have come out of this ordeal intact. She is accepting of who she is and doesn't seem to hold hatred or ill will for those who have harmed her. I never felt heat from her words-- she simply told it how it was. I salute her."
3,Not as riveting as I'd hoped,"This book had an interesting premise, and the author certainly went through a lot that could have been avoided had it not been for her neglectful parents and ignorant ""care"" providers. However, the reading was very disjointed and at times I felt like I was reading passages that were VERY similar to ones I had read earlier--that is, it often felt repetitive. I would have preferred either a book chronicling Daphne's experience in much greater detail, or not to have read the book at all--sometimes the $23 dollars I paid for it seemed like way too much money for such a short book."
1,Memoir of Denial,"Scholinski attempts to attack the mental health field in her memoir ""The Last Time I Wore a Dress."" She asserts that she was held through her teenage years because she was not feminine enough in the eyes of idiot doctors. However, I found little evidence of her tomboy nature contributing to her hospitalization. Scholinski never considers the consequences of her actions, she is dishonest, histrionic, and self-absorbed. It is a lack of maturity, not femininity that causes Scholinski's downfall. Amazingly, Scholinski never sees her actions as having anything to do with the state of her existence. This short, simple, and repetitive novel is a memoir of denial."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This product is awful and looks NOTHING like the picture! When it arrived, it was a big ratty mass of fur--not shiny hair like the picture shows.I can understand the necessity for a ""no return"" policy on wigs, but Costume Craze refused to even take a look at the wig I purchased or consider exchanging it.I tried to comb it out with a wig brush, but after 2 hours of trying, I threw it away.Don't waste your time or money."
2,ok,"This wig is a really funny idea, but the quality of it is not great. It gets huge and puffy through out the wear of it"
1,Looks are deceiving.,"I just received my Pumpkin Spice Wig today. It was shipped in a timely manner, but it looks NOTHING like the picture. What I received was a mop of tangled hair and one side is longer than the other. Hopefully I can make it look half way decent in time for Saturday's Halloween Party. I'm really disappointed in this product."
5,Do not buy from DVDDonkey website,I did not find the complete collection of Carol Burnett on Amazon so I googled it and found in on DVDDonkey. I ordered and paid and no merchandise was delivered. Apparently this has happened to many people.Be careful.
3,good entertainment for the money,"I bought this to entertain my 79 yr old mother while she was staying with us for a few weeks. She howled as soon as she saw their faces. She would have given it 5 stars, but I wanted to see more of the real thing. More clips of Tim Conway would have made it better for me, but it really was great fun for my teenagers too."
1,The Carol Burnett Show (2) disc Special,This item was a birthday gift for my wife since she loves Carol Burnett. She was terribly disappointed when both dvds were only clips and cast discussion regarding their most memorable years. What my wife wanted was the seasons dvd starting with Season 1 or any season episode available. None of the season dvds are able to be purchased.
2,Too little of the actual shows,"I bought this hoping that it was mostly excerpts from the show, but it was mostly Carol and others talking with not enough of what we all loved so much back in the day."
1,Very poor videos.,"What a waste of money! I expected a wide variety of the funniest skits from the CB show, but all these videos are is a bunch of old people laughing at their screw-ups. I don't even get to see the whole skit, so I don't see the humor in it. Yes, the Carol Burnett Show was great. I don't need to pay money (and time) to be told that!"
2,Disappointing Carol Burnett - where are the episodes?,"I was disappointed in the Let's Bump Up the Lights/Showstopper set. I was expecting episodes from the old Carol Burnett Show, but instead it was a ""Reunion Show"" - I am not likely to watch it again and it was NOT worth the money!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,This dvd was funny and appealing as all the shows of Carol Burnett were. But it is just exerpts of funny moments. I was hoping for a few whole skits in the shows that took place. That was not to happen. I have some old Sid Caesar tapes that have actual shows. They are worth the money. J. Asheville
2,"ONLY the ""Bump Up the Lights"" parts of several shows","Perhaps I didn't carefully read the description of the video...therefore, we were disappointed in the video. It is ONLY the ""bump up the lights"" parts of several Carol Burnett Shows - None of the other parts of the show. It was OK."
4,Carol Burnett Tapes,"I purchased this 2 disc set for my father for his birthday and he just loves them. He could watch Tim Conway and Carol Burnett all day!! I just love amazon.com; the list of movies available is unending. I might have a look for some good Blue Collar Tour tapes for myself and I don't think I will have to look any further than here!!Thanks for your prompt delivery as well,Carmel Scott"
5,Clips from Carol Burnett shows provide lots of laughs!,"If you are of fan of Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway and/or Lyle Wagner, this set of DVDs will bring back memories and provide plenty of laughs."
5,The Carol Burnett Show,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift and will not be able to review until Dec 25.However, it's Carol Burnett - how could anyone not enjoy it."
1,Boring,"I read the plot outline ""Television show featuring skits by Carol Burnett and her comedy troupe"" and expected 30 minutes of the best of her shows. They just sit on stage and reminisce about old times. The only one laughing is Carol Burnett at all the fools dishing up money for this sad product. AVOID!!"
2,THE BOXED SET IS AVAILABLE...,"...but apparently not yet on Amazon. All 250+ episodes from the 11 years it was on. A google search will turn up the info. I agree however, that this ""Bump Up the Lights"" edition is a joke. And not a funny one."
4,cast iron mortar,"I grind eggshells to dust in this (to add as calcium supplement to homemade dog food) and bought it specifically because it was cast iron instead of something softer or more scratchable. It suits my purpose perfectly. My only quibble is that the pestle is a little short for use with the larger bowl and my hand then gets in the way. But with the smaller bowl, I find it a fine ergonomic fit."
3,Another lovein,"Who is this guy? Ahmad Rashad?...another piece of shlock journalism. The fact one of his fans would kill another for a Chicago Bulls satin jacket scares me, not to mention that girl/woman who wanted him to run her over with his car. It's scary what fans will do."
2,never shuts up,i am tring to listen to my songs and it keeps talking and burping. there is not a setting on it to make it shush. it has good sound though and can go very loud. lights change colors to the beat of the music. cool
1,If my friends could HEAR me now,"""If my friends could see me now""(track one) sounds like it was mastered from an 8-track tape they found lying in the dirt! Doesn't even sound like it's in stereo! Very muddy. AVOID."
1,tire for scooter,never received tires so can't review. If i could they would probably be awesome they have a great tread design.
5,Los hermanos Primera #1,I have this CD and The songs of Servando y Florentino and Sandino are very beautiful. I love Sandino like I love Servando y Florentino they are los Hermanos Primera and los Primeros!Hermanos Primera I love You Guys. I like to see you soon in my beautiful island of Puerto Rico.
2,"Cute, but didn't last long","I really liked these bibs when I got them, but I have been throwing them out one by one recently because of the MOLD that has been growing on them. Maybe it's because I live in humid south Florida, but no bib that has been throughly cleaned after each use should develop a nice growth of mold. I washed them in the washing machine on hot, and dried them in the drier as well, and the mold stains stayed. We like the Sassy bibs better, even though they are a little more expensive. I have had them longer than these bibs, and no signs of mold or any other stains yet!"
2,Get Bumkins instead!,"I urge you to get the Bumkins bibs instead. These ones are not as nice. Bumkins are by far the best bibs on the market and there is no comparison. Those bibs are soft, protective, non-staining, non-fading, fast drying...worth every cent! I have packed up all my others and only use Bumkins."
4,Bib Set,They are great bibs. They are a little big around the neck for my 6 month but she'll grow into them. Also some of the patterns distract my girl. Otherwise love them. love the pocket and love the fact that you can rinse them right off.
2,flimsy and garish,"I'm disappointed in these bibs. the ones I received are quite different designs from the ones represented online, and they are really very ugly; there's only one out of the five which I can bear to have my daughter wear. And beyond the aesthetic problem, they are much thinner and flimsier than they look in the picture. I got them to keep my daughter dry when she practices with a cup (she spouts like a whale). These are better than a cloth bib for that, ,but she still gets wet."
2,it was good but...,"What was the song that went ""run baby run baby move on in everybody gets out before they get in""?"
3,Not The Best...But Good!,"Back In summer '99 I saw the music video for Britney Spears' song ""(You Drive Me) Crazy (Stop! Remix)"" and saw that it was on the soundtrack to ""Drive Me Crazy"". I wanted it so bad, it was all I could think of. I finally got it that Christmas and listened to it all day long. My fave, of course, was ""...Crazy"" I also liked: ""I Want It That Way (The Jack D. Elliot Remix)"" by the Backstreet Boys; ""One For Sorrow (Remix)"" by Steps; ""Sugar"" by Don Philip; and ""Stranded"" by Plumb. Unfortunately, that is about the only good songs on it. I don't like the Barenaked Ladies' ""It's All Been Done"" or any of the other songs. I do, however, think it is worth getting anyways. Who knows, you might like them..."
4,"Silage, Plumb stand out","BNL, Britney, BSBoys, yeah yeah yeah....I you want to hear something not on the radio 24/7 (yet), check out the Plumb and Silage songs on here. Plumb gets it for coolest lyrics, and Silage wins by singing ""It's alright to write a song that SOUNDS LIKE everyone else's song""Check out their full CDs!!"
3,What???,"My favorite song in this movie, Wig-Wham Bam by Sweet, wasn't on this soundtrack. What the heck???"
2,Only 3 good songs,"This album has some really bad songs on it, like Britney Spears - (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!), Backstreet Boys - I Want It That Way (The Jack D. Elliot Remix) and Steps - One For Sorrow.Having said that, Less Than Jake - Help Save The Youth Of America From Exploding is amazing, and I also love The Donnas - Keep On Loving You and Barenaked Ladies - It's All Been Done.The other songs aren't great."
4,What a great collection!,What a cool mix of songs! I knew I was going to like the ones that I have heard before (Backstreet Boys and Barenaked Ladies) but I also LOVE the song Regret. What an awesome surprise from a band I didn't know before now!
1,why isn't all the music on the cd,theres a local band from my area that had a song in the movie but did find its way to the sound track and it pisses me off i want to know y wasn't on there.
3,A mixed bag,"Like most soundtrack albums, ""Drive Me Crazy"" is a mixed bag consisting of some catchy little numbers and several filler cuts.Among the gems are Don Philip's ""Sugar"", a light and breezy ditty which samples the Jackson 5's ""ABC"", along with notably tracks from Plumb, Jars of Clay and Phantom Planet. Also included are the expected contributions from teeny-boppers Britney Spears, who contibutes a very nicely remixed version of the album's title track, as well as cuts from the Backstreet Boys and Steps.For those with edgier tastes, there are songs from Less Than Jake (ska), The Donnas (punk) and the Barenaked Ladies and Matthew Sweet (alt.rock).Overall, this is a decent collection with a diverse roster that provides a little something for almost everyone."
4,Great CD,"Very good CD. I dont like, i hate actually, Brittney Spears and Backstreet Boys, sorry all u fans, but everything else is great! i love stranded by plumb and keep on lovin you by the Donnas is pretty good. but overall, 4 stars!"
4,BSB I Want It That Way (pop mix),ok I havn't listen to the CD but I listened to the samples on amazon.com.I love The Backstreet Boys I Want It That Way (pop mix) but I don't like Britney Spears Drive Me Crazy. my friend keeps singing too many Britney Spears songs. so if your like me and like BSB and don't like Britney Spears I recommend you make your own choice. Have A smile:) and don't frown:( Have A great Day
4,Pretty well put together!,This is one of the best soundtracks that I have heard! It has great songs (CRAZY and ONE FOR SORROW) but it has a few downfall songs. but all in all i would recomend it for your cd collection.
1,Disposable pop S***,Backstreet boys? Britney Spears? Who cares? At least there are decent songs by Less than jake and the donnas to wash the taste of the pop s*** out of your mouth. Less than jake deserve to be on a better soundtrack than this. They are too good a ska band to be insulted like this
2,Very Flimsy for a Swiss Military Item,"Attractive watch but not hearty AT ALL. Scratches when you look at it. The stem totally detaches from the watch and after only 7mo or so, it quit running. CHEAP"
4,Ani would love this!,"This tribute to Mizz DiFranco is right up the folk singer's alley; there's a clear love for the source of the songs, and the Lounge Brigade seem to revel in the fact that they cannot do it as well or better than her... and so they just do it totally different. This beats that Alani Davis chick who tried to ""improve"" 32 Flavors with her own all-too-top40 version. Good fun for fans of Ani DiFranco who have a sense of humor!"
1,What were they thinking?!,"If you love Ani Difranco more than likely you will hate this album. Lounge brigade has manipulated some of our favorite songs into trite midi stuff. This isn't lounge, this is bad web site music."
1,You have got to be kidding me!!,The only possible reason for buying this CD is just to get it out of circulation!!
4,I beg to differ,"I couldn't have been more excited when I saw that my two favorite musical genres had teamed up, Ani and Lounge!! Sure, I was leery but I couldn't deny it, nor could have been happier with my purchase! Of course it's not Ani, but that's the point! I think it's great that she and her incredible lyrics have been paid tribute to and transformed into a totally new sound... it's like a whole new album with some spiced Ani sprinkled on. And as far as how she may feel about it, Sara Lee was in on it, and I don't think she'd get involved if Ani wouldn't approve! So, open your ears and check it out..."
2,Dissapointed,"I was truly dissapointed to hear how ani's music was butchered. At first, I must admit, I found it amusing but I'm not a fan of lounge music so now its just going to collect dust on my CD rack. I'm sticking to the true Ani music. Thanks anyway."
1,"If you're a fan of ""Muzak"" this CD is for you, how sad!",Probably one of the worst CD's I've heard. It's more of an offense to Ani DiFranco than a tribute. It's not even kitsch!
1,Curious? = yes; Any good? = No,"Talk about uninspired blech! If you are going to attempt to be loungy and weird, then at the very least, do it in an interesting way musically. How anybody could take a handful of Ani gems and turn them into flat and uninteresting melodies is just downright bad. There is nothing hip or refreshing about this disc. If you are an Ani fan, I know you are curious...but save your curiousity and money for her next album."
4,yuck!,This book is very interesting. It has [lots of descriptionsabout people -just what I needed to keep my attention. My favorite part [are allthe descriptions]. This book is interesting and you won't get it from your parents because they will be majorly grossed out... hopefully not YOU! I recommend this book to kids who don't like to read much because this one will keep you awake for weeks.
2,Needs more editing,"Just opened the book for the first time and already found 2 mistakes. Under piano sonatas: k. 279, 2nd movement is in the parallel minor, not subdominant as the text implies. Also, k. 310 2nd movement is not in the relative major, but is in the major VI of A-minor. Hardly a reliable source for program notes or research. I'm wary as I read any more of that book."
5,Useful for Canoeists and Kayakers,"If you want to know where the water flows in Massachusetts, this is the book. It shows the major river systems throughout the state and the significant tributaries within them. Although it was probably intended for environmental study, it could be very useful to canoeist and kayakers. A rating system describes the smoothness and scenic attractiveness of many navigable rivers, as well as showing the locations of dams."
2,Looks sloppy,"This high chair cover does a pretty good job at having plenty of openings to fit various high chairs but I feel it looked sloppy. It's also a very thin material so the pattern on the high chair shows through. I was using it to cover my daughters high chair to make it look ""boyish"" but it didn't do a great job."
3,highchair cover,"item will be practical to use, but I wasn't expecting it to have such an odd fit on the chair."
1,high chair cover,"Very disappointed. It is a colorful piece of plastic, no cushion at all! Bought it for a high chair as a replacement cushin."
3,It's ok...,This is perfect for putting over high chair covers but mine had no cover. It was damaged. This is a good alternative but we need a larger one and this is the largest (size C). It still works but is a bit small for our collassal hand-me-down with no cover high chair. I just wish there were a larger one. I would recommend this product especially for people who travel or eat out a lot.
3,Review of the one size fits all highchair cover!,"The cover works fine but, may have to wash by hand. Will use the covers as a substitute of the main covers.Thanks"
2,not what i had in mind....,"I ordered think thinking that i would be able to replace my high chair cover which cant go into the wash...this has no padding and is just basically a ""slip cover"" to hide the stained high chair cover. Fit is okay, but not really what i was looking for."
1,Not a good product,"No padding, poor fit and very thin plastic material. The box it was delivered in was a higher quality than this pad. Not recommended at all."
2,"Awkward fit, but all we could find","Purchased as a spare cover for an Eddie Bauer traditional style wooden high chair, this is all we could find that claimed to fit the model we had. And yes, it can be made to fit, but the fit is awkward at best. Slick fabric is slippy for a wiggly child and there is no padding whatsoever. On plus side, it is easy to wipe clean so requires less frequent laundering."
2,It covers well my highchair but isn't confortable...,"When I bought this highchair cover I thought it would be comfy... But I was negatively surprised because it's just a piece of a material like a nylon that covers the highchair. Maybe I misunderstood the description, but the fact is that I expected more..."
3,Interesting but...,"Very detailed report of the Air War in Europe. However, I missedthe certain information in details. It would have been most interesting to see the following data: on American side: claimed kills and the real losses in German records. And the same figures on German side. Now the author seems to accept the US claims as valid kills and it seems to be that on both sides the claims have been vastly exaggerated. The granted kills have always been (not on purpose) higher compared to facts. This happened frequently with B-17s since there were hundreds of gunners in the combat box shooting the same fighters. The author could have checked all those figures. Impossible? Not at all. Take a look at the remarkable novel ""JG26"" by Donald L. Caldwell. He has done his homework and the results are a bit of shock... on both sides of course, but interesting to reader."
5,Excellent history of ETO aviation,"O'Neill has provided an excellent history of B-17 operations in the European Theatre of Operations during WWII. Admittedly, this books is a bit dry in the beginning, and many times I thought that the missions all sounded the same. But slowly, the book gripped me and I was soon caught up in the danger and courage the crews experienced.Detailed oral accounts from the actual combatants is what makes this book enjoyable. If you are looking for a book to give you a feel for what B-17 crews went through during WWII, this is it!"
4,"Personal stories of terror at 12,000 feet","A first-hand look at the war, from a warrior who saw a lot. At times a slow read due to diary tone of the work, ""Wing"" leaves a vivid impression of the details and daily turmoil of daylight bombing. So many things could go wrong, and that was before there was long-range fighter protection. Just surviving the trip to the target could be a miracle.Discipline and training matter. Commitment to the cause matters more. Courage helps, but it's not enough. This book understands the small, human parts that go into a large, heroic effort."
4,son's present,"I purchased this book as a gift for my 14 year old son. He has a strong interest in history, WWII, and reading. He enjoyed it very much and has re-read it."
5,Book follows a B-17 crew,"Book was a fun read of a B-17 crew as it completed it's missions. I think this book would be fun to turn into a movie for for the drama of trying to complete 25 missions. If your into WWII, great reading about some of the people involved."
4,"Nice Shorts, Zipper not great","Overall these shorts were what I was looking for. I bought several pairs a number of years ago that were of better quality, these have a cheap zipper, but at least it is brass not plastic. The second time I wore the shorts one of the back pocket buttons popped off, I don't use those buttons so it didn't bother me to much. The rest of the material and stitching seem to be ok. Give them sometime to break in, they do get more comfortable with multiple washings."
5,Excellent purchase,"This was an excellent purchase, it has great quality materials. The colors are so vibrant. Actually you can use it at all time."
1,poor quality,The material is very stiff even after washing with fabric softeners. The cut is also kind of weird. Did not like these shorts.
2,poor quality,I would not recommend this product for anyone that needs a tough grade product.The shorts arrived falling apart and it has taken months to get it straightened out with sender.
4,Shorts,Fit good made to last come down past knee just the way I wanted. They run a little big but that's more comfortable.
2,quality is not all that,Not as good as I hoped it would be. Quality leaves a lot to be desired. Material is uncomfortable on the skin. Would not recommend this brand for clothing.
1,do not buy from these ppl.,"horrible service if your wanting ur size they will send you something much bigger .i said large which is 30 32 like the chart said and irecieved a 35-39,??idont understand"
2,Not the best recording,"I love The Williams Brothers, but for some reason this CD was not recorded well. Not a good deal. It could be because it's an older recording, I'm not sure."
3,World Class? Almost...,"One of the most underappreciated soul/gospel quartets of all time. They were among the first groups to meld the 'traditional' quartet sound with Soul, R&B;, and Funk. I like to refer to them as the O'Jays of Gospel not just because of their energetic performances, but also because of their inability to gain any respect from the mainstream. Because, like the O'Jays, the Williams Bros. legacy is largely overshadowed by the success of their predecessors(Mighty Clouds, Jackson Southernaires) and their contemporaries(The Winans, Commissioned). Despite that, this is still a solid, well-recorded album that was daring for its time. Fave tunes are:Take it To the Lord in PrayerI'm Waiting on TimeAll the WaySo Good to Be Alive"
5,Opened my eyes to Spiritual Warfare,"I always knew that I was dealing with something more than just my children's will. ""Wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places. Eph. 6:12) This book helped open my eyes to a different way of praying to deliver the extensive strongholds placed on my children, especially since they are are adopted. Not only do they have the birthparent's generational sins, but ours also. We are in a war for our children, and it's time we wake up and start fighting where the battle really is!"
5,thebest blues slide player I have ever seen,It is truly a pleasure to witness an artist at his craft. The slide playing and blistering blues solos of Rich Harper should be heard by every blues afficianado. This is a CD that will remain at the top of the 'play' stack.
2,Pretty worthless unless you have skinny shelves.,"This mug holder looks nicer than many, but the way it is built, it is virtually useless unless you have very skinny shelves. It is all one piece that is supposed to slide onto a shelf, but if it isn't a small shelf, it won't fit unless you bend it far apart. Then, once you get it on the shelf, you can't put anything directly above it due to the thickness of the piece that holds it in place. It causes anything up there to fall over because it can't sit straight. I am going to be purchasing a different unit because this is pretty much worthless."
3,Functional,"The hooks are spaced a little too close together to hang normal coffee cups on each one. Teacups would probably be fine. Once filled with cups, the rack sags a bit at the end that isn't anchored."
3,For small cups that will hang such that they nest together.,I can only use 3 hooks per side. My Corelle coffee mugs are just too big. Could be more useful for hanging utensils.I screwed mine to the underside of my cupboard. It's not necessary to slide the wire over the top of a shelf.
3,Too Small,If you're hanging tiny tea cups this would work fine but the rungs aren't spaced widely enough to allow for standard coffee mugs.
3,Probably good in general; mine was defective,"It looked solid, the finish seemed good, and I assume they're generally pretty durable, but the particular one I received was oddly bent on one end, and wouldn't slide onto my cabinet properly. I assume this was just one of those things, and most of them are probably fine. (it wasn't my cabinets; I have four other kinds of slide-on holders that work) Returning it was trouble free."
5,Good,"The product arrived in time and was as pictured, however I couldn't put it on the bottom of my cupboards as I originally planned, due to the size of my cupboard, which is a bummer, but not the product's fault."
2,Poor design,Main problem: I can't place normal sized mugs on all the arms because there is too little space between each one. Its a pretty major design flaw. I think it would work as designed if you were only hanging expresso size cups.I can't comment on the under-shelf feature as I mounted mine under the cabinet. Last issue is that because its mounted the weight of the mugs causes the side that would otherwise be supported by the cabinet to sag.I would look for a different product if you are interested in hanging more than 4 normal or oversized mugs from the holder.
4,Functional and efficient,"I do like this product, it fits nicely in my cabinet and holds 8 mugs. Notice there are 5 hooks but in my cabinet only 4 mugs can fit on each side because of the space. I suppose with more room, or if I put under my cabinet not inside, then all 5 would fit on each side. Overall, I really like the product and I will probably order another one."
1,piece of junk,i bought this to create more space and it did nothing but take it up it doesn't hold all the cups it says it will it is not worth the money i spent on it i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. buyer beware
5,Great Reading,"I love the author, her stories and when they take place. Life wasn't easy in the early 1900's and Abbott captures the essence of the era very nicely. I enjoy reading her stories. So far I've read all of them I can find. I hope the National Archives have more. Recommended if you like short stories."
4,A Great Read!!,I really like to read. I heard about this book on a television show and researched to see if it was a real book. I loved it! Eve had character as did her father. She was a lady like no other!! I recommend this book to people all the time.
2,Fails to present sufficient new content. More of a DM aide.,"The Explorer's Handbook advertises itself as being a book for, well, exploration for both DMs and players. When I first purchased it I was expecting a well written discussion on travel and adventure in Eberron, perhaps similar to a wilderness guide discussing all the fantastic inbetween places in Eberron. What I got was disappointment.This book is, by far, a DM oriented book that describes a number of locations you may wish to insert into an Eberron game. The locations tend to be focused on the mid to extremely high levels. The Prestige Classes are the only part of the book I would consider being oriented towards players, and there are only three of them. The writing, on the whole, is sub par."
4,A good intro into DMing Eberron,"This guidebook has tons of great insights to making an interesting and fun adventure in the world of Eberron. Although definitely not a necessity, I'd recommend it to any beginner or intermediate DM."
2,"high production, low content","it seems to me that the entire Eberron product line is victimized by the same glaring flaws. I now own this product,the main campaign book, and 5 nations. they all have wonderful art, a durable design, and a very pleasing interior layout. However, this book cost $30 (less on amazon) and has roughly 128 pages of text. If you're the type of gamer who is looking for an enjoyable read full of clever twists/plots/ideas; then you might also tend to gloss over the assorted charts, npcs, and worthless side notes. That brings it down to under 100 pages. Not only did WotC rip me off with this book, but they also don't have much to say about this shiny new campaign world."
3,Not Sure It Covers Enough,"Princeton usually offers a) a thorough coverage of what's on tests, b) tricks of the trade to beat the test, or c) both. This book provides information that's on the test and gives a trick or two, but it's not a strong enough resource for a test that is consistently labeled as very difficult. It's wiser to borrow it from the library or look at it in the store than to buy it. Online materials, including Vade Mecum ([...]) are MUCH stronger resources."
5,This book relieves the pressure...,"When I took the GRE in lit three years ago, I didn't know about this book. I wish I would have. Studying literature isn't like studying math; you can't just learn the formulas to be successful. And with such an anbundance of literature from which to choose, you may get the feeling very early on in your course of study for this exam that you have no idea where to start. Now I'm taking the exam again and this book helps. This book more than helps. Let the experts guide you. They've studied the GRE exams and know ETS's trademark question styles that will help you. The writers and contributors to this study guide help show you where to start, what to emphasize, and how to study for the exam rather than the material, and they do it with a sarcastic wit that keeps you interested. Buy this book - if not for the infinite wisdom, for the pressure it relieves."
2,brazilain cooking,Many of the ingredients are not available at a regular and even gourmet grocery store. Measurements seemed a bit off.
2,It would be nice if the items were properly labeled,"This is the second disc in a set, which I was unaware of. It would be nice if Amazon would have mentioned that in the description. As far as the CD itself goes, it's pretty good though now I need to find a copy of the first CD.Be more responsible amazon!"
1,a book for women only,"this book is for women only - and does nothing to address the needs of men who grew up in violent alcoholic families. It even uses the words ""SHE"" and ""HER"" when descibing the victim or person seeking recovery."
4,Good Used Book,"I bought this book used and it was decent shape. The description said that there were markings in it and there were, but I was buying it for the content, so the markings did not bother me in the least. It was an economical choice that worked for me. I am glad I bought it."
4,"Technically bad, but so catchy...","Technically, this album is weak...too much sampled, artistically bad...But This group is the most attractive breakbeat thing I've ever heard. Okay! It's bad...but your ears love it nevertheless. Listen to ""Coz I Can""...hard, sulfurous, this track makes you wanna jump in the air.Perhaps one of the most catchy big beat track I own."
1,I've had better...,"The only reason I bought this CD is because it has that song from ""Me, Myself, & Irene"" where Charlie turns into Hank. That song is not on the soundtrack to the movie. I don't know who the idiot is who put the soundtrack together without the most played song in the movie... anyway. That song is awesome, but the rest of the album pretty much sucks."
5,The acorn doesn't fall far from the tree,"It is easy to see why Al Gore has grown up to be the man he is. In Al Gore Sr.'s political memoir, we see a rare figure in American politics--a man who is slow to reason, but quick to act; smart enough to understand the issues, but compassionate enough to think of the consequences of his policies. Senator Gore held firm to basic American values during the turbulent times of his political career, the values of fairness and concern for the little guy. Even if it weren't a good background study into what makes our VP (and possibly next president) tick, and regardless of one's political persuasion ""Let the Glory Out""--with its great introduction and eulogy from junior to senior Gore--is a terrific testimony of the love between father and son."
3,Canon Pixma MP760 review,I received it very quickly. It didn't work so I went to the Canon company to get a replacement. Canon said the MP760s were no longer made and they sent me a MP800 instead. I was not told by Electronics Expo that the item was no longer made and it might be hard to get parts. The only reason they are getting a 3 is because I did bypass them and didn't give them a chance to right the problem. I don't like to be called about my reviews and after I made the first one I was called several times. Telling me I should remove it. I did so simply because I didn't give them a chance to fix it. DO NOT CALL ME OR I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT.
1,"Sorry, I disagree","I read and researched this product for a month. I was so happy to get it. I still have a 10 yr. old Canon product! It was great.....However, after only 6 months, I started to have ""on/off"" problems and now my print cartridge carriage locked and sparks were shooting out of the printer!Customer service is so hard to contact......their site is even difficult to download!Bottom line, this model is not even being manufactured now! Interesting, since is was rated in the top 3 by a noted consumer rating co. What does Canon know?I spent over $200+ on this, and it is going to the dump because Canon's warranty is limited and if it is shipped back to them ($60), THEY decide if it was defective or I caused it!!!! Guess who will win?What a mess......I'm debating buying a Canon product now?"
3,Decent multi-function for photos,"This multi-function printer comes with all the features you'll probably want for handling your digital photographs. It handles many different kinds of memory cards and has two paper input methods, which is nice.It lacks some features that would be nice to have for business uses (document feeder, fax). The built in menu system could be more intuitive."
1,Looks great but...,"I'd love to give my new Canon printer a try but I didn't receive anything in the box but the printer. No documentation, no install discs, no starter paper, no ink and NO POWER CORD. And good luck getting any help from Amazon. Click contact, fill in the fields and wait while I stare at my nice big silver doorstop."
5,Very good for the price,"In comparison with similar product this stands out and has MANY features that others lack. It is not laser quality but then again, it is not laser priced. In the quickest mode, the color gets really light which I don't really care for. It is straight forward and very easy to use with little or no training. I haven't even begun to use all the features but those I have attempted to use were very easy to complete. The ink usage seems to be very good and there are many aftermarket alternatives for ink since it uses the same cartridges as many of the other cannon printers. Expect what you pay for with this unit. As I said, it's not laser quality but for just about $200 the quality is far superior to earlier ""all-in-one"" units and even to most of the current available models."
2,"If you need legal size copying or scanning, you are out of luck","J. schaulis's review is fantastic. I wish he had commented on legal size copying and scanning. The most important things to copy adn scan in home are some legal papers.I find most Canon AIOs can handle legal paper, but they can not actually copy of scan legal documents (not sure about printing), they can only copy or scan up to 11.7"". If you want copy or scan true 14"" long legal paper, you have to use HP AIO.I hate legal size paper, but what can I do? This is the USA, we use ""legal paper"" and stick to ""inches""!"
5,So Far A Wonderful Purchase,"I only recently purchased this printer to replace the crappy lemon of an Epson CX5200 that I got (please never purchase Epson...it's soo bad that it should've been recalled ASAP). As of 1 month I am happy with this Canon printer. It's print-out quality is pristine for pictures. I haven't worked out all the GUI buttons on the panel yet, so I can't give it a complete review. Suffice to say I am really glad I made the switch."
5,This machine R O C K S!,I bought this bad boy about a month ago and am extremely pleased with it's output and scanning capablities. The photos are just stunning and it prints very fast (typical 4x6 color takes less than a minute and an 8x10 takes about a minute). It's not too heavy so one can lug it around (if need be) fairly easily. My only problem is the cost of the ink which ran me 67.00 for all 5 tanks. I love this thing and look forward to many years of enjoyment with it.
5,This toy is awesome!,I received the Republic Gunship on the 17th of September. It is awesome. The ship has 4 firing missiles and has a swiveling cannon in the back. Plus it also has a grappling hook in the back. It has two storage bays under it's wings. I personally think though that the troop deployment thing is alright. What I personally think is the best feature is those doors on the sides of the ship.A few hints that I would like to tell you:1)Put the stickers on the wings before you put the wings on the ship. Also attach the missiles to the wings before you put them on.2)Put the missiles on the opening doors before you attach them to the ship.3)The grappling hook stinks in my opinion so I suggest keeping wrapped up in it's package(if you want to).Overall this ship was great. You should really get it if you are a kid who loves Star Wars like me.
3,The holding area kills this one.,I owned it at one time and was dissappointed that most figures couldn't stand up in the holding area. It really killed the toy for me. I just can't recommend it.
5,REPUBLIC GUNSHIP,"OK TO START OF WITH IT IS OF THE HOOK!.... IT IS 25"" LONG, 21"" WIDE, 10"" TALL. HUGE BASICALY. IT HAS 2 TOP GUNS THAT SHOOT MISSLES, 2 SIDE TURETS(WITCH YOU CANNOT PUT CLONE TROOPERS IN),2 FRONT GUNS THAT FIRE AND SPIN AROUND. IF YOU HAVE 2 PILOT CLONE TROOPERS THEY COME WITH 1 TURRET EACH YOU CAN ATTACH TO THE CARGO BAY THE HOOK ON 2 LITTLE PEGS. IT COMES WITH 2 GRAPLING HOOKS,AND A BUTTON ON THE TOP WICH OPENS THE 2 SIDE DOORS.BY 2 MORE CLONE PILOTS AND HAVE THE 2 COKPIT PILOTS.IT CAN FIT THE ACTION FLEET AT-TE IN IT LIKE IN THE MOVIE. AND IT CAN HOLD DOOKUU OR ANIKANS SPEEDER BIKE IN IT. THERE IS A BOOTUN ON THE BOTOM WITCH DROPS THE PLATFORM WITH FIGURES ON IT. ON MINE I HAVE 4 PILOTS 2 IN COKPIT 2 THAT SHOT THE SIDE TURRETS. I HAVE AYODA ON IT MACE WINDU 1 REGULAR CLONE TROOPER ON COMMANDER TROOPER KIT FISTO AND SOMEONE ELSE. A CLER CD CASE MAKES A EXALENT STAND. IAM 10 YEARS 0LD I GOT IT FOR X-MAS. PS BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT."
1,no good,"It has nothing to do with the sales person who sold this, but the product is un safe with out a thumb guard. To dangerous and too hard to usse. I sent it back and I am not even sure now if I got credit for it. Did I?"
2,Waste of time and money,"To begin, this genre of movie is not usually my ""cup of tea""...but I can sometimes enjoy a really gory, over-the-top movie. My mistake here!This movie actually has a disclaimer on its transfer quality. Believe it!The transfer is mostly poor. Hazy, fuzzy scenes are throughout this feature. There are also places in the movie where the sound is not clear.The acting is mostly sophomoric.I should have saved my money."
3,"Great Music, Poor Sound","This is an outstanding Daevid Allen album. Too bad the remastering of the original tapes didn't get the attention deserved. The album sounds as if muted. No amount of fiddling with your stereo's settings can compensate for Snap's poor re-recording of this classic. And that's really a shame. Every song on this disc is first-class. If you're a Gong/Daevid Allen fan you need this album in your collection. My advice, find it on vinyl on eBay. The sound will be light-years better than this reissue."
4,Zulu again,"If you've read ""The Zulu Principle"" you'll find most of this book familiar. In this '96 edition Jim fine tunes his stock investment strategy presented in his '92 book. It's not just a revised edition, but written from scratch, although it looks and reads very similarly.In a nutshell his preferred investments are medium sized companies which are going places, showing steady growth in earnings per share combined with good financials. Jim presents about a dozen key points to look for in selecting shares.Additional material in the '96 version include a newfound emphasis on ""relative strength"" and a section on ""suggested reading"".This book is easy to read, spiced with quotes, anecdotes, illustrations and examples. The ideas presented make a good deal of sense and are easy to understand."
2,It's too hard to clean.,"Before i purchased this waffle maker, i read that it was easy to clean. i do not find that, at all. i have to go in and out all the crevases with soapy water and a wet cloth and then rinse it the same way. It's a pain in the neck."
3,Interesting movie....,"It's fun for what is is, really low budget but that didn't take the enjoyment out of it, for a good low budget movie, this is it!"
4,Pretty good information,"This book errs on the side of ignorance and is a little old fashioned (for example, the chapter devoted to ""What happens if you have to go grocery shopping if your wife can't while she's pregnant."") However, if you understand that some parts are dumbed down or out of date, it's over all a good book. A lot is geared towards things my husband likes to think about - financial planning, how to help me feel better, etc."
4,Excellent for first time fathers,"This book was great, and helped me understand what my wife was going through-- as well as providing constructive things for /me/ to do for her, rather than fidgit. Having a vault of constructive ideas helped me feel much more a part of the process."
2,Eh...,"My husband had a few books he read after finding out we were expecting, and this was his least favorite. He said it wasn't very practical."
1,Not respectful of baby's aliveness/personhood,"If you're fine with a book minimizing the personhood of your baby, go with this one. It makes the companion books mom is reading sound like overly hopeful fairy tales... instead of sweet things about your baby's development, it mocks them in early pregnancy. My husband had me trash this book after reading several sections, saying that he just didn't want to think about our developing baby in such a poor way."
3,very average,"This book has WAY too many reviews. Are these real or fake?I think the book is ""average"" in writing style and content. Nothing special."
1,I found this book offensive,"I am an expectant father. In my opinion, this book has an offensive tone, and makes terrible assumptions throughout. Here is a sample what the book suggests a woman might be feeling during pregnancy (literal quotes): ""afraid you won't love her after the baby is born (after all, she's not the same woman you married);"" ""may be afraid she won't have enough love to go around (what with loving you, and all);"" ""feelings of jealousy (after all, it was her private pregnancy until now);"" ""increasingly dependent---needs to know that you'll be there for her, that you still love her;"" ""she might be afraid that you don't love her anymore, and you might leave her."" And so on. What kind of weak, spineless, self-loathing creature do the authors take the average woman to be? There are plenty of books with on-the-money, fact-filled advice for fathers; this isn't one of them."
3,Men need practical,"The book was delivered very quickly, what I really appreciated. About the content: my partner partly found it quite informative and partly he found it to female. Apart from that, it is a good thing that this book, written by a man exists. All in all worthwile, if you can accept other attitudes and let yourself be surprised by them, maybe they can be a door for different angles of view.one complain:My husband was upset that""Pages fall out on the first day. Not a practical book for man reading."""
1,the expectant father,"THIS BOOK STINKS. THERE IS A SEGMENT ON WHY HUSBANDS HAVE EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS DURING THE LATE STAGES OF THE MOM'S PREGNANCY, AND THAT THERE IS A RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS, SO I GUESS SUPPORTING THOSE WHO PARTAKE IN INFIDELITY. SEEMS TO ME THISHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PREGNANCY, AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SUB-STANDARD EXCUSES FOR HUMAN-BEINGS AND THE NEED TO FEEL ""O.K."" WITH NOT BEING FAITHFUL TO THEIR SPOUSE. PERHAPS THAT SHOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE LIBRARY, NOT IN A BOOK WHERE SOMEONE IS TRYING TO LEARN THE INS AND OUTS OF THE JOURNEY THAT AWAITS THEM IN THE HAPPIEST TIME OF THEIR LIFE. THIS BOOK IS A POORREPRESENTATION OF THE GREAT LITERATURE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL AND THAT MIRRORS YOUR INTELLIGENCE AND JOY."
2,Am I in the minority on this one?,"I am glad I received this as a gift, because I would have been upset if I spent my own money on this diatribe. Two stars is a stretch.My main beef with this book is that it talks down to the reader, IMO. Not that I know everything about women and pregnancy but I didn't just get out of fifth grade either. A little insuting on the intelliegence. What red-blood male needs to be told he needs to be more understanding and supporting while his wife is pregant? Hopefully all of us know that already. I also disliked this book becasue the author tended to throw in some of child-rearing opinions that seemd a little far to the left and really not neccessary for this type of book.I have found that ""What to While You Are Expecting"" to be much more informative as it moves past the redundant and obvious.Stick with the minority on this one. Buy one of the many other books out there that cover the subject, but better."
2,"Written by a man, but made for a woman","While this book is written by a male author, don't look here for any pearls of wisdom that were passed over by the author of the pregnancy book sitting on your wife's bedside table. This book is full of sensible, measured advice. I'm sure that any pregnant woman would be delighted to be attended to by a husband as doting, sensitive and as in tune as the ideal man described in this book. That man, however, would more resemble a woman than the real world creatures we all know and love. If you are already a man for the new millenium, this book may resonate with you. If you still have some Neanderthal man left in your gene pool, this book will annoy you endlessly."
1,Nah...not for me,"I started reading the first part of the book. All I've read thus far is the negatives such as birth defects, miscarriage, and other bad things. I'm excited about being a father and the last thing I want to here about (in what I thought was a positive book) is the beggining to start like this. I may bring myself to read further, but not what I wanted to read at the beggining"
3,Good but old,This is a cute book. I bought it for my husband and read a little myself. I made him stop reading because the book talks alot about expences and the problem is the book information is fron 1995 so it was a bit off. I did not want my hubby to be miss guided in that department
