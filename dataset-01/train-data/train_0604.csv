4,SILENT CLASSIC,"Enjoyable old Tarzan, silent film. The run time is 266 minutes, not 90. The chapter headings are:1. CALL OF THE JUNGLE2. THE ROAD TO OPAR3. THE ALTAR OF THE FLAMING GOD4. THE VENGEANCE OF LA !5. CONDEMNED TO DEATH6. TANTOR THE TERROR7. IN DEADLY PERIL8. THE LOOP OF DEATH9. THE PLIGHT OF WERPER10. PRISONER OF THE APES11. THE JAWS OF DEATH12. THE JEWELS OF OPAR13. A HUMAN SACRIFICE14. TARZAN'S RACE15. TARZAN'S TRIUMPH !"
3,quiet,"I normally don't watch silent films, but this one was not bad. It is good for those looking for films to see where we have come from and this film even has a little nude swimming. I like the raw films of the jungle and this one is not raw enough for me, but it was fun to watch.J.R. Bolton"
3,Good but not great,"This is the second DVD I purchased to learn about the history of US Women's soccer. While this DVD is well done and does get the facts across, it is not nearly as enjoyable to watch as Dare To Dream. If you are trying to decide between the two, I would definitely recommend choosing Dare to Dream over The World at Their Feet."
4,"Good, not Great!","It was interesting to watch and really showed the personalities of the women's team, however was a bit slow moving at parts other than that a good film to watch."
5,Wow!,"Skrowaczewski, Saarbrucken and BMG/Arte Nova score again!!!! This release has much in common with Skrow's 7th: radiant playing, great engineering, and a way with the music that makes you think that no other conductor could possibly ever do. Skrowaczewsi, a vastly underrated conductor if there ever was one, is the master of climax--he successfully builds massive climaxes using smaller ones to get there; an essential ability in Bruckner."
4,A Glimpse Into the Recent History of F1 Technology,"If you're already well-versed in the latest F1 technology and are looking to further your knowledge to the absolute edge of the ""state-of-the-art"", this book may seem a bit stale. Like any technology-related book, it has become dated quickly.But if you're a information-hungry ""techie"" who is relatively new to F1, you will enjoy the book. It serves as a valuable reference guide to the recent (mid-90s) history of F1 technology. It helps you put things into perspective, explaining how current F1 technology arrived at its present state."
1,Can be quite annoying.,"There is some merit to this DVD, but it reminds me of the proverbial babybottle of milk that contains just a little bit of cyanide. In this case thecyanide is prophetic speculation, inaccurate ""scholarship"", and extra Biblicalcurrently popularized theories presentedas if they are established facts. One example: The author statesthat all Jews believe Isaiah 53 is aprophecy about the Messiah. Not so. From ancient times it can be shown that some rabbismade that connection, but today virtually no rabbis will admit to any suchtruth. They prefer to say, for example, that Isaiah 53 refers to Israel.This is a very long DVD, over 2 hours, and the scene seldom changes. Here and thereone can see photos, or news clips,of something other than the author holding hisbook version of the DVD, but not often."
3,Diamonds are very small. No sparkle,"I liked the size of the pendant. The diamonds are so small, no one would even know they were there. No sparkle."
5,youthful faith making reality,mark has expressed none less then magic in his book reminding us all of the simple beauty and imagination of becomming the dreams and innocence of living the child's eye view of each day.
4,One of my very favorite gothic mysteries.,"Full of suspense, chilling prose, and sexual tension, Virginia Coffman weaves a dark tale of suspense that will easily captivate and hold her reader breathless.Set in rural France in the early post-Napoleonic era, young Irish housekeeper Anne Wicklow grows suspicious of her favorite charge's darkly enticing uncle. Setting off for war-torn France from the boarding school where she met the young girl as the school's housekeeper, Anne attempts to find out why her young friend is being tormented by her ""loving"" uncle."
2,Kindle version,"The book is still enjoyable after all these years, it's the Kindle version that stinks.I don't know who had the task of transferring this to ebook but it's very badly done. The wrong letters that force you to go back and reread the word to make sense of the sentence is bad enough, but there are places where a whole passage or, in one case, about a page and a half of the text, is missing. If I wasn't familiar with the story, and didn't have the book itself to fall back on, I would be in the dark about what was happening.BTW, who designed the book cover above? It looks like a book on lesbian erotica, not a gothic romance."
3,Came in good condition,Took quite long to come but arrived as was said during estimated arrival time and was in good condition
2,??...,"This is not an easy read. Extremely informative, maybe too informative. But it will direct you to ALL that you may need to know and what to research when it comes down to book publishing. I kinda treat it like a reference/workbook. but it is very challenging to just sit and read.."
4,Great Adventure,This is a little rare to come by now days. If you do I highly recommend it. It is informative an dcovers teh 1st 25yrs of teh Rolling Stones by the people themselves. One of the better music vid's to own for sure.
2,"Comfortable, but shoddy workmanship","Bought a pair of these shoes a few years ago, thinking that they might be an improvement over the original Stan Smiths, which I'd been wearing for years.It's a very comfortable shoe, lightweight with adequate support but the seams started to split on the show (left shoe, inner side, on the upper) long before the sole started to wear out. Having literally gone through over a dozen pairs of the original Stan Smiths, I'd always worn out the soles long before the uppers wore out. It was a disappointment to have to throw out the Millennium version while there was still plenty of tread on the soles. Am back to wearing the original Stan Smiths, and Rod Lavers."
2,Cushiony But Poorly Made,"I have owned a few of these shoes and appears each one is made by someone on the line who can't put a shoe together. Either the tip of the toe separates from the sole's tip or the toungue of the shoe is offset, or in this case the shoe has an oblonged look like that of a whale. I give it two because its comfy and don't care too much if all I do is use these to work out in the garden. There are many other shoes I've read reviews on that are as comfy and not as poorly made."
5,"Excellent product, service - overall transaction!","Fast shipping, reasonable price, and quality product were part of a total quality transaction - Thanks!"
5,There isn't a more comfortable tennis/casual shoe,made PERIOD!!. The leather on this shoe is glove soft and the sole is like a featherbed. I always enjoyed adidas tennis sneakers over the years but this is the only sneaker that allows me to serve and volley with comfort and agility as if I was floating across the court. THey just look cool to. I look forward to buying 2 more pairs as back ups and tryingthe stan smith II as well. JUst try these you will love em'.
1,Seagate portable external hard drive - no good to me!,"I've installed lots of hardware & software, but this was the worst! I'm sure the drive is great, but the software & instructions are bewildering. The software I thought would come with it (Bounceback Control Center) was omitted, since this drive is < 100GB. I've spent HOURS trying to figure out how to use it, without success. Unless you are a ""super techie"", avoid this item."
1,Piece of Trash,"I bought this item to simply back up my data in case of a hard drive failure on my machine. I could count on one hand the number of times I've used it, and I keep it stored safely and never take it anywhere. It just died on me at just over a year old. Right as the warranty wore out.No more Seagate for me. One and done."
5,timely delivery and good product :),"I enjoy the way this external hardrive doesn't need a powersource, that it runs from the USB is fantastic. I travel most of the year and would have liked to have had the option of a container for this product, otherwise I am totally satisfied!thank you for your timely delivery!"
2,Cypress AT2LP RC42 driver,"When I bought this drive, I thought this is the best one. But after using this product for little more than a year, I can't say the same again.My USB drive stopped functioning due to external casing/enclosure failure and gave me an error message ""Cypress AT2LP RC42 driver not found"". I was surprized to know that this driver is NOT shipped in the box or cd.This drive came with 1 yr warranty and I was out of warranty by this time. Interesting to note is that other Seagate drives comes with 5 year warranty.To make my drive work again, I had to buy a new external enclosure/casing from a third party vendor and then it started working again.Thank god I did not loose any data. But be prepared for a data loss and regularly backup your important data."
4,Good Drive....For the Office not travel,"I bought this drive thinking of using it for travel, I ended up using it in the office, the most travel it does is between office and home.It works great, passes info from drive to pc and viceversa with good speed, don't know the specs but I havent waited long at all. The only 2 downsides to this gadget are its size, to travel its big, for the office its great becouse on a desk it looks small; and the second downfall are the cables, no direct USB connection, you have to use cables which I have no doubt I will eventually loose.All in all, great back up drive for work."
4,You want to read this book...,"Excellent novel. The setting is a wonderfuly complex and detailed sci-fi setting. I first read this work several years ago and had recently started to regret letting my original copy go, so I picked up a replacement on amazon. I really don't know much about the author Nicolas van Pallandt; but it would be nice to see some more genre work from him."
5,An Enchanting Journey into SF,"This is an amazing book! I can't wait to hear more from Van Pallandt. The world he creates is realistic and terribly addictive. As you try along with Gabriel Kylie to solve the mystery of his sister's murder, you become enamored with Kyara and all the fabulous characters that inhabit it.This is a book that will stay with you. I've read it over and over again and I never get tired of Van Pallandt's witty and humorous prose."
5,Richard Clayderman Live In Concert,This is a really good dvd of Richard Clayerman's music!! The fade in's of the orchestra are nice touches too. The selections on this dvd are great choices! I also enjoyed the interview with Richard Clayderman at the start of the dvd and the video of the french marina and countryside. This dvd is a must for anyone who likes the music of Richard Clayderman.
4,Hella Good,Not bad. Some of the songs blend into each other and your not sure what track your listening to.
3,doesn't translate very well,"Half of the songs on this CD are difficult to recognize as tunes by No Doubt. I don't believe that the music lends itself very well to lullabies. We own two other Rockabye CDs, and they are far better."
1,Never received this item.,I cannot review this item because I have yet to receive it. I have contacted DVDLegacy and they assured me that the package was on it's way. I never received a tracking number from them so I had to trust they were sending the item. Now I have sent them another message and have heard nothing back.
5,Must-Have for Serious Guitar Shredders,"Beethoven's Guitar Shred is a must-have for all serious guitar shredders, metal and classical lovers. The Great Kat breaks the shred guitar speed barrier. Check out ""The Flight Of The Bumble-Bee"" - a hot female guitarist in fishnet stockings shredding at 300 BPM! Classical Beethoven meets wild shred guitar!"
1,Disappointed,"If you want to see the Great Kat shred, don't buy this video. The videos of her playing are to prerecorded tracks and mostly do not match what she is playing. Also, if you are looking for any instructional information it is not here."
2,Questar ruined my memories of this wonderful mini series,"I concur with the person who said Questar ruined this lovely old mini series that I watched when I was a child, I bought it recently not realising that the end episodes where missing and was exceedingly dissapointed by it, I watched it the day I received it and therefore disrupted other peoples viewing because I was so enthralled and wished to continue to the end, therefore I was and am very upset. Although it was nice to see something that was a childhood favourite of mine, it was a bitter sweet experience for lack of ending!!!!"
3,Disappointed,I was enjoying watching this programme as I hadn't seen it for a long time. Then disappointment IT DOESN'T FINISH!!!!
2,Ricci Manzoni - over sized,The quality of the product is good but no where on the website do they call out that this product is oversized. If you are a person with very large hands it would be great but for the normal person - it just does not work. It is not the type of product that is good for everyone. Keep taht in mind if you are purchasing.
1,Get some new friends ASAP!,"This film tries hard, very hard to be fun, clever, and scary but fails on all accounts...The stories are very poorly written, and acted even more poorly. There isn't a single scare to be found, except when the movie is over and you realize you wasted 90 good minutes of your life watching this...The second story is mildly amusing, if only to see the food to come to life in the fridge. But after that, it's all downhill. WAY downhill.Its amazing to think that someone, somewhere read this script and thought it was a good enough idea to put money into. Hey, if you're reading this, I have a script I'd love to sell you...For the horror buffs, just say no to this...and move on. Not worth even a passing glance."
5,Masterpiece,"i dont know know how to start to explain the magnificence of this piece of motion cinema. one word i suppose would be breathtaking, another would be ahead of its time. it simply is a must see piece of film.and always available at a reasonble price.if there were more films like this on display to the public the world would be a better place."
3,These are not the same arrangements as the original movie soundtracks,"I was disappointed that these are not the same arrangements as the original movie soundtracks. For example, in Colonel Bogey, the countermarch from the movie soundtrack is not included in the arrangement on this CD. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good, but I would have preferred the same arrangements as the original movies."
5,An outstanding compilation,This compilation is superb and a real must-buy. From Band of Brothers to A Bridge Too Far: every war movie theme is represented here. An all time classic.
3,The really good ones are missing.,"While this compilation has some masterpieces such as the theme from The Great Escape and Is Paris Burning, it's missing some of the finest tracts ever written. Where is the theme from Victory and Ernest Gold's stirring epic from Cross of Iron? The closing theme from Inchon was also a feast for the ears, but it's not here. It was written by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the foremost soundtrack composers of our time. Instead we're subjected to the likes of Hanover Street and The English Patient. I'll admit Inchon and Victory weren't Academy Award winning movies, but their soundtracks were second to none. As John Stossel would say,"" Give me a break""!!!"
3,The Longest Day: The longest collection!,"At first glance, this collection of 53 tracks seems impressive, and it comes in a quadruple jewel case with 4 cds.The problem is that there are a lot of B-grade movies on this cd and B-grade movies tend to have B-grade themes. Also there are a few movies included that are only arguably war movies (such as Casablanca).Further adding to the boredom is the fact that these are not cut from original soundtracks- these are all done by one orchestra, and they don't always pull it off too well. The theme for 633 Squadron is missing the opening sequence and is played way too slowly. Battle of Britain is not actually the movie theme, but is the ""Aces High"" march, played only when the Germans are on screen.Many of the themes are simply sleepy and tuneless and I found myself fast-forwarding through the collection to about 10 tracks that are decent. At about 20 dollars for the set, it's just not really worth it."
5,Bobby at his best!,"Bobby ""Mack the Knife"" Darin presents and stars in this showcase taped in 1970 at the height of his popularity. Featuring special guests Linda Ronstadt and George Burns. Includes ""If I Were a Carpenter,"" ""Simple Song of Freedom"" and a knockout rendition of ""Hi De Ho."" #1320 - 48 min"
1,Invasion,"We are looking for Bobby Darin singing ""Sunday in New York on Video. There is no listing on the video's of the songs.Does anyone know if there is a video of Bobby Darin singing this song? Thanks"
3,Texas One Nation,"This very thin book is appropriate for elementary school students, no higher than the 4th grade.The first chapter inexplicably starts with Texas music. I recommend chapters start with The Land, The People, Texas History and then cover culture, music and facts. A picture of the beautiful State Capitolwould be a nice addition also. The discussion of Texas History and the sights was good, including the pictures of the famous Alamo and the associated battle. A few more pictures of the various cities, oilderricks,the Big Bend National Park and the San Jacinto Monument would add a lot of color and make thebook much more interesting to 3rd and fourth grade readers."
2,"Good, I guess, if you're into this type of thing","You'll probably like this book if you believe critical race nonsense. Otherwise, skip it. I gave it an extra star because I feel bad about being the only person to review it... plus it is printed on nice paper. That's about all I can say about this."
4,Jefferson,"There are an awful lot of cuts on this CD. Lead singer has a great voice; some song selections are better than others. Overall, a very good buy."
3,A Few Great Tracks,"Patty has done some great ballads, but on this particular album, she's much better when she keeps things up-tempo. Highlights are the great country-rockers, ""Halfway Down"" & ""I Try to Think About Elvis"", along with the harmonica blues of ""Feelin' Good About Feelin' Bad"" & the piano-driven ""Old Weakness""."
4,"Unique, unique and hey.....did I say unique?","I've just returned from three months in the Sertao region of Bahia Brasil. Que legal! I stumbled upon Afrocyberdelia through a friend and immediately went to the loja de discos to see what else this master of fusion had to offer.What did I find? Da lama ao caos! This masterpiece of ear candy that blends just about every type of rhythm-full music you can imagine.If you can score the double disc set (I imagine it will be available here soon), grab it also. It has some great B-sides, live stuff and great mixes by some of the best Drum and Bass/Jungle DJs as well as the master himself, David Byrne. Get it? Got it? Good!"
4,Fun for all ages!,"We bought this game for our 5 year old son last year. We all have enjoyed playing this game. Even my 3 year old can play it. On certain levels, if you crash or run out of time, you start over. Now my 3 year old may not understand the concept or figure out exactly what to do, but he enjoys just being able to move his car aound. They love the cars that they get to pick from, and it makes the game so interesting for them. When other kids come over, this is always the first game they want to play. We have not experienced getting stuck in corners, we are usually able to get out of the corner by reverse or flipping the car over. I would recommend this game to any age, it is fun for everyone."
5,Grandson's Favorite Game,"My grandson has been playing this game since he was 4 and it is his favorite PS game. We have to help him unlock the cars and weapons, but once unlocked, he takes over and does great. I'm going to buy another one so he can play at home also."
4,Hot Wheels Velocity X,I purchased this game for my son.It was to replace the exact game he all ready had that wasaccidently broken.My son is nine years old. He has enjoyed playing this gamefor many hours. he has only about ten PC cd-rom games andthis one is one of his favored out of all.It in hard to findPC games that do not contain alot of graphic volence.Over all this is a very good game for younger players.
3,It was ok for the price,"The little stinker looked super cute in it, but it was big on the head and tight in the body. Not the absolute best costume, but still super cute! Worth it to show off your lil stinker!"
3,Three great minds interviewed by one British Idiot,"Three of the greatest minds of our lifetime and very little new or useful information. Magnus Magnusson asks some of the more redundant and useless questions. Hawking shows he is not only a mathematics genius he is a surprisingly witty comedian. Arthur C reminds me of my grandmother ,and Sagan is ,as always, three steps ahead. It's not a bad dvd but having devoured most of their other work this one leaves me feeling like I wasted a little time and money. Oh well, go science!"
5,Takes my baby right to Lullaby-land,"As a mother of a one year old, I can tell you that this CD has saved my sanity on many car trips. I keep this CD in my CD changer in the car at all times. When baby starts to get fussy, I turn this on and within a few minutes, she's either calmly listening to it or sound asleep! Besides the fact that it works so well to calm my baby, it isn't the same old lullaby's that you are sick of by the 10th time you've heard them! I often find myself singing along with the CD (there are no vocals on the CD, but if you are a Smashing Pumpkin fan like myself, you can easily sing along with the instrumentals). I would whole-heartedly recommend this CD to parents."
1,coen brother's collection,I did not realize the violence in this collection. One I will never watch - Blood sinple. I thought Raising Arizona would be a comedy but was a sick sense of humor. Foolish purchase.
3,Coen Brother Collection Blu-ray,It's Amazing have this edition ? Why because this movie very smart. You will see a top story. Transfer Image 5/5 and audio 4/5 and Feature 1/5 very bad !!!And I vey upset this edition because i thinks Amazon give good prices. until few days this item more less than i buy it .
3,Please clarify,"""Occasional softness or a little grain notwithstanding, these are very well-done Blu-ray, and I think easily the best these film have looked since they first hit theaters.""How can a legitimate blu-ray transfer have ""Occasional softness or a little grain notwithstanding, these are very well-done Blu-ray,....""?? Will someone explain this ""transfer"" process and how it could be of variant quality within the same film title?"
2,Got DVDs instead of blu-rays,I ordered what was listed as a blu-ray collection. Product arrived in blu-ray cases and identified as such on discs. Upon playing found they were plain DVDs and also in fullscreen instead of widescreen. Be careful!!
4,"Good Value at $19.99, Fargo Missing Extra Feature",I got this at Best Buy on sale for $19.99. Not sure if it is worth more unless you do not own a previous DVD version of any of these movies. Fargo is missing an extra feature found on the Special Edition DVD version -- the Charlie Rose Interview with the Coen Brothers and Frances McDormand. This makes no sense why it was not included.
4,"Great service, couldn't ask for more","The boxed set came quickly in new condition just as advertised. The boxed set itself seems a little cheaply made, but there is nothing wrong with the disks inside."
4,Nice collection,I had a couple of these but enjoy having a whole collection.Vwery good value.Your own Coen Brother film festival.
4,Coen Brothers Collection,"Nice anthology of Coen Brothers films. My favorite movie is Raising Arizona followed by Fargo. Mixing pathos and humor is an integral part of their movies. Looking back at the movies with actors such as John Goodman and Nicholas Cage, when they were younger, is also fun"
3,"Don't own, but be cautious","So I don't own but almost bought then I realized... if you have a lot of Pinot, Syrah, or Champagne bottles, these are not going to be good as the bottles will slide out as you stack them on top of each other. Great for standard cab/merlot bottles."
3,Good but repetitive,As per previous review but it's like when you get the large Amos Milburn or Louis Jordan boxes.Not a whole lot of variation between the artist of early R&B; and Jump Blues between artists as within one trick ponies like Jordan.But it is better than having one artist.Funny I thought I really dig this more and can listen to large sets of latter Blues or Rock like say Bo Didley or a John Lee Hooker.But this genre is really tight.Worth the lower end tab asked for here though.But not the set you can feed into a 6 disc player and let it rip without a break.CheerioChazz
2,What do you want from this cd?,"Errr actually creativity and direction is what we want just like the previous albums. This should have been titled David Gilmour part III or the follow up to that 2nd DG album ""about ..."" ooops sorry ""about face"". I bought this cd for [$$$] in its first release in '94 and was very excited (sorry but I liked Momentary...)but as I listened to it I just can't help but regret wasting my money. ..."
3,Not as bad as Momentary,"OK, David and co dug a HUGE hole with Momentary and this bad impression of David Gilmour and Leanord Cohen's love child is supposed to set things right? What about the SRV ...riffs? i hope not. They got 1/4 way out of that hole with this one. Pulse showed they're not hopeless as human beings, but Pink Floyd died March 21, 1983. That is my observation. Pulse is a coverband and Delicate sound of thunder is a bad one. Division Bell is not the place to go for a floyd record but it is if you were trying real hard out of respect to like momentary and if you liked momentary don't speak to me. 3 stars ...i wouldn't dare say anything bearing the Floyd name is worse than that."
4,Listen a few times before you judge.,"When I first played this CD, I thought, ""This doesn't sound anything like Pink Floyd."" But after a listening a few more times, it really caught on. High Hopes is probably one of the best Pink Floyd songs ever. It may sound different than the classic Floyd works that Waters worked on, but that doesn't diminish its quality."
3,All style No Soul,"If you ever wanted to know what happens to Rock Bands who lose their creative force. Pink Floyd is a classic example...Without Waters, this album is just musical wallpaper. None of the old punch and great lyrics. After just 2 studio albums Gilmour and Co don't even have the right to refute what I have say.The music is of the highest standard... but what can I say! They sound more like a depressed ""ASIA""!"
2,Great music for soulless robots to listen to,"What made Pink Floyd so amazing was their ability to write such evocative music, music that made you feel...it sends chills down the spine, makes you laugh, makes you cry...but this album makes me want to puke. It sounds as if pink floyd has finally done what happens to even the best...they got old. I suppose they must have fallen into a rut. Gilmour's playing licks he used on every one of his solo albums, and the singing, while passionate, begins to drone on uninspiringly after the first five minutes. For any band, this is a bad album. For pink floyd, it's abyssmal."
5,Division Bell,Pink Floyd - Old school...the beginning of the experience. BUY IT! You need to understand where they came from and the musical learning that brought them to where they are.
3,a decent swan song,"what realistically is their last album, Division Bell has real moments of excellence, notably Take it Back which seems to out-U2 U2 in its musical scope and comes off all the better for it. It's just one example of the akbum's flawless production, which really helps the album along. Some suffer from being quite dull (keep talking and marroned) though it comes into its own towards the end of the record, with Lost For Words displaying some wonderful folky solos and High Hopes really sums up the English countryside rather well in its nostalgic, romantic lyrics."
3,Floyd is over,"Floyd is not Floyd anymore without Waters. Efforts like Pulse, or Anybody out there, where they play old Floyd-songs make me sad. Those R the best examples that without Waters they R not Floyd anymore, Gilmour and his band just can't put a valuable album together like The Wall, Dark Side or Wish U were here. The Wall was the peak, The Final Cut is a great end 2 a great band. They go on and on, but what is under the name Pink Floyd today is nothing but Gilmour and his band only, not Pink Floyd."
5,More magic from Mr.Gilmour,"(...) As a musician and guitarist for 13 years, believe me when I say that this is one of Floyd's best albums ever. If you're a guitarist, it's especially enjoyable, but anyone who appreciates great music can delve into these lush, haunting soundscapes. Standout cuts are Poles Apart, A Great Day For Freedom, Coming Back To Life, and High Hopes, although every track is good. After a few listens, these dreamy tunes will have you punching the repeat function on your CD player more than once. Superb recording!"
3,"At Least It's Better Than ""A Momemtary Lapse of Reason""","This album sounds somewhat like vintage mid-'70s (pre-Animals) Floyd. This time Wright and Mason were there as musical particpants from the start, and Wright composed music for a Floyd album for the first time in nearly 20 years, and Wright's influence in particular helps make this a far more pleasurable listening experience than the previous Floyd album, ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"". That said, most of the songs here are rather pedestrian, redeemed mainly by the Floydian arrangements, and the bite of Roger Waters' lyrics and album concepts is certainly missed. When this came out, a reviewer called it ""Lite Side of the Moon"", and while this album is pleasant to listen to I think that is not an inaccurate description. Still, I bought it and like it well enough."
4,solid pink floyd,all in all a good cd. Definately not there best but still better then most bands greatest hits. the album starts off slowly but builds up steam. it seems the best tracks where placed at the end. My personal favorites where Keep Talking and the climactic High Hopes. If you are a Floyd fan you will like this cd. if u are not chances are you wont.
5,A Better Bell Without Roger Waters,I thought The Division Bell is a wonderful CD. I only purchased it after watching AOL's Sessions archive with David Gilmour. He played it there. I have to say his rendition in 2006 is better than the one they originally did. But the album has lots more to offer. Don't miss it. And push for David and company to do some Pink Floyd's best now. They play and sing better now than they did back then.
2,"Better Than Lapse of Reason, but that's not saying much","This is a far better album than Gilmour's previous Floyd album without Waters. However, it is still far inferior to Pink Floyd's brilliant albums of the 70's, as well as Waters' solo album Amused To Death. Some of the songs are pretty decent--they all lack emotion, but are fairly melodic. The ""What do you want from me"" song is really annoying, though. I like Gilmour's solo albums a lot better than this, however. Reccommended only is you already have everything else Pink Floyd has made."
2,Formulaic Drivel,"I have all of PF's official releases, lots of individual solo works, and plenty of imports......The Division Bell is not Pink Floyd....I have the impression that this album is three dudes and a hoard of studio men/record execs attempting to sound like what they think ""Pink Floyd"" is supposed to sound like.....it is unfortunately musically bland at best, and the lyrics without Roger are mostly lightweight cheese. Gilmour's guitar is still true, and some of the instrumental passages are ok, but it is a shame that this albumm bears the name of the band that has released so many classics in their time....Formulaic Drivel....I ended up giving it away; sad, eh?."
5,Lost for Words,"It's not the Floyd that you're used to, but it's still quite good. It's quite a bit better than Momentary Lapse of Reason. Some think that it has a deeper meaning as well, I'm refering to the publius enigma. Look it up, it's sort of interesting. In any case I wpuld recomend this to any true Pink Floyd fan."
3,Pink Floyd Lite,"Musically it sounds like Pink Floyd, lyrically it pales.The two songs which are true stand-outs are the instrumental ""Marooned"" and the single ""Keep Talking"" (which sonically reminds me of something from the Animals album).Everything else is just ok."
4,Surpasses its predecessor,"This album is far superior to its predecessor, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. David Gilmour is the dominant composer on this album, whose noteworthy contribution to this album is ""High Hopes."" However, The Division Bell is incredibly long and Dave definitely throws in some bad tracks, such as ""Take it Back"" and ""Lost for Words."" This album is so long that it could have dumped the filler and still been a very comfortable 45 minutes.The real difference that sets this album apart from AMLOR is that Rick Wright is back in action, composing and singing on ""Wearing the Inside Out"", an album highlight. He cowrites the instrumentals ""Cluster One"" and ""Marooned,"" both of which are very nice to listen to. The tracks written by both Rick and Dave seem to naturally sound the most like Pink Floyd.So if you were dissapointed by the 80s Gilmour solo effort mistakenly billed as ""Pink Floyd,"" pick this up and I think you'll find a few tracks worthy of that title."
2,Pink Floyd died years ago; another Walking Dead recording,"As a longtime fan of the Floyd I of course bought this cd and found it BORING AS HELL to listen to. I was never a fan of Roger - Captain Ahab - Waters, but I agree with his saying the band died creatively many years ago. Also, with all these dozens of extra musicians playing one must ask: who the hell is Pink Floyd? The three remaining old men? All twenty people on this record? Answer: whatever sells! And millions of sentimental idiots like me forked over the $17.95 and listened hopefully to Son of Dark Side VII. Sure it sounds like ""Pink Floyd"" but moves me not at all. Dave, Rick and Dave should be able to retire Comfortably Numb after this. My copy is now in a used cd store; at least I got four bucks for it."
1,empty blockheads,When you are listening to this CD you probably wanted that the brain of floyd still was with them. Altough some melodielines are great it is an ordinary popalbum like thousends of others stupid musicmakers would make them and who call themselfes musicians.
1,Bad bad,"I just love Pink floyd. But this is not Pink Floyd. This is crap pop music. No more Gilmore, Gilmore no more. Roger Waters where are you???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Number one Pink Floyd Fan"
2,Faux Floyd,"Folks, you really can't have a true Pink Floyd album without Roger Waters. They can call it what they want, but this is Gilmour and Crew and it's not all that good. Not nearly as intellectually steeped as real Floyd and not as passionate. They do a nice job creating the Floyd sound at times and the production/sound quality is fine, but this is just not the real thing. Gilmour's latest work ""Smile"" is far better and it also features Rick Wight (RIP.) In my opinion, Smile works much better because Dave is not trying to be Pink Floyd, but is just following his creative instincts. This is the last album any Floyd fan should buy. The best reason to own it is to have a complete collection, which is why I have it. For those just getting into Floyd, I'd recommend Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here. Division Bell is one of the very few ways one could go wrong with Pink Floyd."
1,"Apparently, Gilmours wife isnt a very good writer","Roger Waters, the creative genius, couldn't take the non-stop crybabying from David Gilmour and Rick Wright who never seemed to have anything to contribute and so he left Pink Floyd. So, with all the talent gone from the band all that was left were the three Ringo's of the band.So, Gilmour did all he could do....beg his wife, Polly Samson, to try to sound like Pink Floyd and write lyrics. Well, she tried and the result was this album.It's bad folks......REAL bad.Buy Animals, buy The Wall, buy The Final Cut, but for heaven's sake do not buy this awful, awful album. It is just a cardboard epitaph to a great band that stopped being great when the genius behind the band left in 1983.The only purpose of this album is to make more money for David Gilmour which he is obviously using to buy cheeseburgers."
1,Just read the lyrics!,"Gilmours' lyrics are hints to where he is at. His girlfriend wrote most of them. Real good, too! So good I never need to hear the cd again."
1,"Cold and distant, album leaves me empty","I just cant warm up to anything on this album. It reminds me of some of the NewAge stuff back in the 80s mixed with some of the candy rock of the time. Like George Winston's piano on ""Winter"" where the pauses between the notes added meaning. It seems Gilmour was playing with the space between the notes. Definitely not the space between his ears. If you like this try Jean Michelle Jarre or Kitaro. They do a much better job. Lord knows I've tried to listen to MLOR and Division Bell but PF truely died with the parting of Waters. This is just retire money for Gilmour or he as gone by way of Sid Barrett."
2,Horrifically overrated!,"While I typically do not make it a habit of reviewing albums I do not like, I make an exception for this particular album because it is maintaining a four star rating, which it in no way deserves.This is the worst album ""Pink Floyd"" ever made, and compared to the thoroughly mediocre 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' and the 'UmmaGumma' studio/noise tracks, that's actually saying more than you might think. Only Floyd fans who own every other album PF ever made, as well as the first two Waters solo albums plus all the Syd Barrett solo stuff should even think about buying this waste of polycarbonate."
2,WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET WATERS & GILMOUR BACK TOGETHER?!!!!,"This does have some good ""Floyd"" moments both lyrically and musically. BUT IT HAS NO EDGE!!! I am so disapointed by Gilmour's solo album and by this album now that I've busted it out and tried to give it another round. It sounds like Dark Side after hearing Gilmour's new album, but it still stinks. Waters was the edge and the thunder of Pink Floyd and Gilmour is just floating around without him. It would be like calling The Beatles The Beatles without Lennon. I've seen Waters live and ""Pink Floyd"" in '94 and Waters show had more heart and soul. The Floyd show was cold and meant for fans who think Gilmour's name is Pink Floyd. The sum was greater than the individual parts in Pink Floyd and they all continue to show it. Buy this only if you're desperate-it's worth $5 tops."
3,Hang In There Gilmour Your Best Is Yet To Come (PULSE),What can I say he tried. They brought on a new sound. A soft mellow Atmosphere. I love it but I'm rating it 3 because it isnt the Pink Floyd sound this is more of an Atmosphere CD with words. Please don't think badly of me because of my rating this is the best I could do. I'm a die hard fan! Really I am!
3,Not so floydesque album,"(...) Well... it seems this album turns to be a little less than perfect. (...) Certainly it's not a bad album, it has nice musical arrangements, good performing, and so on... But Pink Floyd always had that tiny, hard-to-describe mood in their compositions that it is practically absent here. Definitely, Division Bell is quite worse than its predecessor. (...)."
3,"Good Music, Good Mood, but not enough Pink Floyd","Unfortunately, Division Bell is the kind of album that you can play at a decent volume and totally forget that it's playing as it is a mood setter. It's not as compelling as Dark Side of The Moon, for which you had no choice but to listen to. It's a good effort, better than Momentary Lapse of Reason (but is that very hard to do) but still not what Pink floyd was before. I got the feeling that they were trying too much to sound like the older albums, but, in a world where music evolves so quickly, trying to sound like the past is not always a good thing, especially for Pink Floyd, who has always tried to find new ways, new sounds, standing still or hanging back is never a good sign, or at least a sign that they maybe losing touch.Still there is some good songs, but like I say, it's not Pink Floyd as we know it."
2,"Try their previous classics, then compare.","Do you really think this cd deserves your hard-earned money? I do not think so. I am sorry, but I really think these guys are just using their once-and-still great name, Pink Floyd to make us open our wallets. Their previous album ""Momentary Lapse of Reason"" was never bad. But maybe that was their best! Since Roger Waters has left the band, they are not creative anymore. Never! I still remember the day I bought this album. With big hope, and Bamm--. What a disappointment!! I do not know if Roger Waters was really ego mania or something arrogant. But he must have been the real core of Floyd. Sorry again, but you'd better pick up ""Wish you were here"" or ""Dark side of the moon"" first.P.S. Their live albums are still pretty cool."
4,"The Division Bell, Pink Floyd","I have only seen Pink Floyd once and it was their last tour shortly after this CD came out. Needless to say, I was totally and completely blown away to the point that I traveled around the U.S. to see them four more times - I had never done that before or since. This is my second CD as the last one disappeared after close friends came to visit. With each listen, I am at that first Pink Floyd concert. What a rush!"
3,good,"this is a good cd, but not a great one. the first track is annoying and slow starting. It gets better with 'a great day....' and laggs a little until the great song 'high hopes' good CD for people who appreciate soft rock."
4,"Very well put together, but...","although it contains some great tracks as far as pop music goes, Pink Floyd has never been the same without Roger Waters. Don't get me wrong, the songs are very ear-pleasing; it's just not this style that made Pink Floyd great."
5,Excellent Floyd CD,"This album offers a rich blend of brilliantly composed music. Although it may not cater as much to the drug ridden 70's crowd, it has a lot more humanity and thrusts Pink Floyd into the spotlight of the greatest band of all time."
3,Floyd's Worst Album,"This is easily Pink Floyd's worst album. The songs are unoriginal, boring, and self-important. However, I gave it three stars because, as musical gods, even the Floyd's worst album is better than most other albums out there. If you want to hear post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd, buy ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"" -- it's not ""The Wall,"" but it's much better than this album."
2,Yet another fouled try,"Gilmour tries to keep the machine going. And quite successfully if you look at the money income. Not so, if you want some music. :-( This album is endless boredom. The only good parts are the first few minutes and the only song Gilmour sis let out of his hands. Wright's ""Wearing The Inside Out"" is really a piece of good work. I'm not the only one who dial 6 soon after he inserted the disc and shut it down after that song is over."
3,ITS JUST NOT THE SAME!!!!,"Roger Waters left the band in 1983 after major differences with David Gilmore, the Floyd went on to make a couple albums without Waters including 1994's ""The Division Bell"". I must admit, I was surprised to hear the change of the music style. It was much different than albums like ""The Wall"", or ""Dark Side Of The Moon"". Though I have to admit that the mixing and the over all quality of the album was great to the ears. But there was something missing I felt. And I was kind of disappointed at the ""pop"" style perfomance, though I guess the Floyd was just keeping up with the times. Over all it was a good album, the cover was a good choice."
2,Bring Back Roger Waters,"This stuff pales in comparison to Floyd's work with Roger Waters.It is lyrically and spiritually empty. Perhaps the best number on the album is Cluster One, and it's an atmospheric instrumental piece.Songs like ""What Do You Want From Me?"" and ""Keep Talking"" seemed forced and written for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off touring.Stay away and don't buy any Floyd post ""Final Cut."""
3,Nice mellow stuff,"Man, i miss the angry floyd of the wall, and final cut, yeah I miss roger. However that doesn't stop High hopes great day for democracy and Wearing the inside out from shining through. Those are the three stars, the rest seems a little dull for me, marooned is predictable. It is nice to hear the boys singing hopefully though.Also the production is weird, reverbed to the point of being muddy. However if I had to compare the production values to Radio Kaos, I'd go with the reverb over the synthesizers and nonsence, because the reverb doesn't ruin the songs.In my opinion Pros and cons of hitch hiking is better, and so is the majority of Amused to death, but it is better than Radio Kaos and some songs on Amused to death. Also, when it come to Pink Floyd all ""classic"" era floyd (1973-1979) is better, and so is meddle. In my opinion this is a little better than Piper and Saucer full of secrets (damn this album is good though) but better than all else in the catolog."
2,More poor man's Pink Floyd? Hopefully the last,"It's not bad, but it's not Pink Floyd and that bothers many. I'd much rather hear Gilmour's solo albums than this bombastic self parody. I believe they did this and the tour to pay for Nick Masons Jaguar collection and Dave's barge studio expenses. So The big deal here was Rick was now a full time member, whoopie! He should have been he only co-founded the original group"
1,Floyd fans - don't be fooled,"This is probably the worst album of the Floyd's career - and even more so because of the amount of time and money spent trying to make it sound like a legitimate Pink Floyd album. I'm not just being anti-Gilmour/pro-Waters either, because I actually thought that Momentary Lapse of Reason was a fairly decent CD. At least they were performing like a band again. Unfortunately, this album gives us more reason to understand that Waters wasn't just trying to be a perfectionist, he was simply trying to ensure the production of quality music, of which little is found here. Nobody seems to have the ability to write a decent song without bringing in dozens of collaborators, and Rick Wright's singing is probably the worst part of this entire production, almost as bad as the computer-generated vocals on Keep Talking. Do yourself a favor, check out Roger Water's ""Amused to Death"" for a taste of how good the Floyd USED to be. It ranks miles above this embarassment."
4,"Pink Floyd still has, and can deliver, the goods","With this album and ""a Momentary Lapse of Reason"", post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd has proven that it can still create poetic lyrics and haunting melodies with the same or very nearly the same high level of brilliance and inspiration.As is the case with classic Pink Floyd albums, ""The Division Bell"" merits numerous listenings to fully appreciate all of its aesthetic nuances, something not unfamiliar to Pink Floyd fans."
4,Better Then You Would Think,"I didnt think i would care to much for this cd when i first heard of it, but was curious of what it would sound like. When i first listened to it i didnt think to much of it untill i got to high hopes, then i had to listen to the whole cd again and it just keeps getting better the more you listen to it. Dont get this untill you've listened to Dark Side, Wish, Animals, and the Wall."
4,About Roger Waters,"We all know that he was Pink Floyd lyricist. At that he was brilliant. But as a bass player he stank. Maybe it wasn't his fault, Rick Wright said Waters is tone-deaf. But remember, Pink Floyd's greatest music came from Gilmour/Wright/Mason not Waters. It was Roger's lyrics + the other 3 guys music that made it legendary. I agree that post-Waters Floyd is a dumber version of itself."
4,Incredible!!,"I wouldn't necessarily call myself a Floyd fan, but I sincerely appreciate listening to such music that can stimulate the imagination as this album does for me as well as my photographic subjects. As a studio photographer, I find the music sets the mood for what I want to capture."
4,Non Floyd fans will like this too.,"I was never a Pink Floyd fan, but I love this album. Darkside of the Moon and other Floyd albums leave me feeling depressed. Division Bell is very relaxing. Track 4, Marooned is the best for going to sleep to."
5,This album is the best Floyd album ever!!!,"With such powerfull songs as High Hopes and Cluster 1, it is no wonder this album is awesome. Buy it!!!"
3,The songs sounded better live.,There are some great songs here but overall it sounds kind of bland. It was a huge success for them and rightfully so. Technically proficient but not a lot of feeling in the songs. Kind of goes down like The Long Run by The Eagles or Gaucho by Steely Dan. Great groups trying to be TOO perfect. The perfection wipes away the soul. And yes Pink Floyd at their best had soul. Still a good album and worth buying.
3,'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' is better!,"This album, I think, was just a kind of 'sequal' to 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason'. I think Gilmour TRIED to outshine MLOR with 'The Division Bell'. There are only a few good songs on this album;'What Do You Want From Me?','Marooned','Keep Talking'...and thats about it. But, if you like PF albums with this kind of taste, thats you. But...I can't turn this album down THAT much...I mean, the 'PULSE-Live' tour the band did prior to this album was cool. Otherwise...it's YOUR opinion."
4,One of the band's better efforts,"The Division Bell is one of the better Pink Floyd efforts. With excellent blues riffs covering each of the songs, this album does a great job of getting you into the feel of the music - drawing you into its spell. Gilmour's riff work has never been better to this point. Give it a spin, I'll bet you'll like it....especially the haunting title track."
1,who is an advocate for fascism here?,"I wonder....I really do.Who is the advocate for fascism here?Look at the horrible cover for this dreadful CD?Now I'm gonna ask you again:who is the advocate for fascism here?Terrible, horrible people, just gross!"
1,TERRIBLE!,"the one thing i notice as i listen to this album is how much pink floyd needs waters. there in no floyd without him. this album is pretty much a disgrace except for ""high hopes"""
3,Better than it's given credit for,"Absolute Floyd purists might not like this album, but I found that I like it. I most like Pink Floyd from the early to mid '70's, up to Animals. I feel this album is the best Pink Floyd that there could be in the 1990's, and amazing that they continued on after Waters departure. This is a definite better record in my opinion than their 1987 studio album. Pink Floyd fans probably already have this album, but even if you only have Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, you might find some enjoyment in the modern sounding Pink Floyd."
5,"Great, if you like Pink Floyd.","If you are even remotely atracted to Pink Floyd's music, then you definitely need to get this. It's a great listen and one of their best cds."
3,Fine product.,"It is durable and works fine. Nothing outstanding, but do the trick and the kid is happy. We had it for 2 years and it still works."
4,compact comprehensivephrasebook with pronunciation,"This book has several advantages over other phrasebooks:* Its got most of Europe (except Eastern) covered, including Irish!* It is small - about the size of two decks of cards.* It has the english phrase, the phrase in the translated language and then in blue how you actually pronounce the phrase. The pronunciations are spot on - the best thing about this book.* It has phrases on absolutely everything - I even got to use my Greek phrase for ""I would not like it extracted please"" when I spoke to a greek student at the Oktoberfest who was studying dentistry. Everything's covered: getting on buses, going to the laundromat, getting directions, etc. About 20 pages on each language with everything that you will need to get by for a while.* It's cheap and all in one book.* A must have for anybody going to Europe who doesn't speak all their languages - I think that's everyone."
4,Even covers Welsh!,"If you plan to travel all over Europe, this book may get you through and save the time and trouble of carrying a different phrasebook for each country. It is small, just slightly larger than the average palm and full of basic phrases.It doesn't cover every language but DOES include Basque, Catalan, Welsh, Spanish, Turkish, Italian, Dutch, French, German and a wealth of others.WHat I especially liked:1. The tips on how to break the ice in each country and join in conversations2.Menu decoders and suggestions for each country3.Essential words to get you through transportation checkpoints and on your way4. Some of the basic sports and festivals in each country.5. Written FOR the traveler with a strong emphasis on the most essential situations when a phrasebook might be needed."
3,Communicating in other languages,Not that helpful. Only used the book once in our travels. Perhaps because there was a level of English spoken where ever we went.
5,Excellent Quick Reference,An excellent quick reference for all your travel language necessities in Europe. And it's a handy little size too.
4,Minority languages,"it is great to see the smaller langauges of Europe in this guide!!WE DO EXIST REMEMBER!!Irish, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Basque and Catalan take their positions as European languages of note!All BRITISH and SPANISH people should know some words in THEIR lesser used languages! Otherwise they are not really British/Spanish!!!"
5,thermos mug,awesome product - keeps coffee hot a long timethe product can be knocked around on the job and stays in tacknew feature is the drinking spout or can use cup cover for liquidgreat delivery time by supplier too
5,Fantastic Travel Companion,I ride my motorcycle to work most every day and the Thermos E5 allows me to get my Starbucks Venti coffee and enjoy it in the wee hours at the desk... great product!
2,UPDATE 5 Stars (from 2 star thoughts after 10 months - Lining problem,"UPDATE: About 8 weeks ago, I went back to Target and saw that the instore samples had no lining so bought a third one and and it has been PERFECT :)It is again my favorite Thermos.OLD COMMENTS: I bought two of these April 2008 (one for my me, one for spouse) and we use them 5 days out of 7. I was originally thrilled by the fact that coffee poured in at 6 am was still perfectly hot and enjoyable at 4 in the afternoon. My spouse's Thermos, (he drinks his coffee black)still seems great. But my Thermos(I use cream) started having flakes inside a few days back which I now realize is some sort of lining (teflon like?) comming off. YUK! I have carried a Thermos to work for 20 years and this was my favorite by far until this ""lining"" failure. Anyone else experience this? Maybe I have a ""lemon"".....?"
2,While its a 'JR' size,"My 12 year old daughter is a very small framed girl, this 'jr' sized release is too small. I cannot imagine anyone smaller capable of shooting a bow. Its just OK, adjustable it is but it just doesn't feel up to the, even inexpensive as it was, quality I expected."
4,Smaller than expected,"I had to order the adult size for my son. He is a big kid for an 8-year old, but I was surprised at how small the junior version is. It is a quality release, just like the adult version. It is very smooth and crisp, so it is a great release, but only for really little kids. I'm going to give it to my niece, since she will be able to get some use out of it."
3,Product descriptions need to include age range.,"I bought this for my 5-6 year old niece and nephew only to receive the box, and it has 8+ on it. And it is actually too large for them. And they honestly need to cease showing multiple tubes in the pictures. It's misleading when you only receive one tube."
4,sturdy pool toys,My kids have used them several times for over a month and they are holding up nicely. Good price for what appears to be a sturdy little pool toy.
2,Be warned! This software also installs AOL,"Any satisfaction we might have felt at the actual performance of this software was sorely diminished by the marketing practices of the Learning Company. We were very disappointed to discover that when we installed this software, we were also given an ""Install America Online-Free!"" shortcut on our desktop, as well as in our computer. We were never given an opportunity to decline; what does America Online have to do in the SLIGHTEST with a learning program for our child? We deeply resent companies who feel as though they have the right to hold customers ""hostage"" to their marketing partnerships. All attempts to write customer service for this company were unclear at best; we will have to call them to complain."
4,A Fine Start,"At such an affordable price, it would be hard to provide a complete collection of any artist of Charlie Daniels' caliber. But, here's a sampling of original recordings of one of the greatest fiddler's/songwriters/guitarists ever to grace the stage. There were quite a few omissions when this collection came together, and possibly, some numbers that were included, could've been replaced with those that weren't! But, there's not a stinker among this compilation. I'll be the first to admit that there are much better collections out there, but for this price, you will never find a better ""basic"" introduction to Charlie Daniels' music....but how could they omit ""Legend of Wooly Swamp""? B+"
3,not quite as good as his last ones but it's still cool,"i'm a little disappointed with john, i have all his cd's and they all were so catchy with his fast paced hip hop/rap tunes but now in boy vs. the cynic he's gotten a little too serious and has gotten more pop. Although he still has some of the beats and cuts and cool sounds like he did before and yes, there is still hope, cuz remember he had this rockish rap sound in are we there yet? too. overall i am a little disappointed, but i am still his fan and i definitely am glad i got the cd, i just hope that his next cd is a bit more like his first three. i give boy vs. the cynic a 3.5 out of five."
4,Favorite,JuJu is my 2nd favorite album by Siouxsie & The Banshees & the remastered sound is fantastic! The extra tracks on this edition are great (Fireworks is different from the Twice Upon A Time version & superior in my opinion). One of the remixes was featured on the 2 disc Best Of but it sounds better on here.
2,Disappointed,"I should have read the reviews before buying this. Like others have said, it's too difficult to open. I had to use tools to pry it open. My children cry because they couldn't open it. Further, one of them tried to use his teeth to get it open and complained it hurt his jaw (as it would). Fortunately, he didn't damage his teeth! I will try what the other reviewer suggested and see if bending the pieces a little might help. Further, the egg comes with a long tag that needs to be removed for better play. Removing the tag is not so easy as it is well sewn onto the product, and the egg is easily damaged when trying to cut it off (don't bother trying to tear it)."
2,Cute but hard for the kids to open,"I really wanted to get my boys a few of the eggs because their friend had one similar to the Haba eggs and they loved it. The shell is very hard, even for me to get apart. The fabric egg inside is cute. The one their friend had had a small weight in the yolk to help it fall out once the shell was open and I really like that about the other brand."
3,Cute but made in China and expensive for quality,"I'm disappointed that this is made in China; I mistakenly assumed it was made in Germany like our other HABA play food. It's cute, a little small and is a nice addition to other play food. I don't know that I would buy it again because I think the price is high considering it is just made in China. My 4 yr old thinks it's cute."
3,Mommy: Hard!,"This egg is cute but very hard to open. The metal is smooth and the egg is small. It's hard to get a good grip on it, even for an adult. My two year old daughter keeps coming to me to open it up or to put the egg back in. She cannot really enjoy that part of it and some times she gets frustrated with me for taking too long to open it up. It's hard to open now, but perhaps with use (scratches?) it will get easier to open.Now she enjoys the egg center for cooking play and the shell as well, but not in any kind of cracking gesture. I think that if Haba could make it bigger in any redesign it would be much better."
5,GREAT GIFT & FUN!!,Santa bought my daughter the large kidkraft kitchen & this toy goes great with it. I like the idea that it is made of cloth...if it gets dirty you can add it to your laundry. It is a cute toy. She is 3 years old so she is unable to fold the egg & close the shell... so she ask me to do it. However she has no problem pretending to crack it open. She loves it!!!
1,Warning - Choking hazard,"Our 1 year-old got a hold of the bottom half of this egg shell and managed to get it stuck in her mouth, 'open' side in. It was one of the most horrible moments I have ever had with one of my kids. It was wedged in so tight there was no way to get my finger in between the egg and her lip without hurting her, which is exactly what ended up happening. By the time we got it out, her mouth was bleeding and she was throughly freaked out and in pain. I felt awful and wished I had never bought this stupid egg for her older sister. It really never opened right as others have mentioned. We used to buy a lot of Haba products, but this item made me fall out of love with the company."
3,3 1/2 stars: You get only 1 egg and egg is small,"This toy is okay.It includes a cloth fried egg and a metal shell. I wouldn't have minded that the shell is smaller than a regular egg (or standard size plastic Easter egg), but you only get one egg. For the price you don't get much.If you don't mind the colored eggs, this one seems more reasonable.[...]"
5,this is the cutest!,A perfect addition to your Haba or play food collection! The fabric egg pops out of the shell when opened! I wish Haba made more like this!
1,Wanted to LOVE this toy,"I bought two of these for my 3 year old and 6 year old girls. They look like the cutest things ever, and as a child, I loved helping my mom crack real eggs to cook, so I thought my kids would love these. They are nearly impossible to pry open, even for me. I'm not exaggerating, I'm a very strong person, but can barely get them opened once in a while. Because they are so hard to open, my kids used their mouths, trying to pry them open...the metal bent, the paint scratched off...I ended up throwing the shell part away b/c I was worried about them getting hurt with them. I love the idea, but some tweaking is definitely needed to make this a better product. I feel it was a total waste of my money. :("
3,It's so cute just wish it would be easier for a child to open it,"Most of the reviews were right-- we could'nt open the eggs.The idea of a toy egg sounded so exciting,but they have some work to do on it to made it work correctly. I think the age should be for 5 and up"
1,Can't open it - and I'm an adult!,"Both the tin painted shell and the fabric egg seem sturdy enough, but after a minute of frustrated prying and twisting, I gave up, and am sending it back. Big disappointment - there's no fun with an egg you can't crack!"
2,Hard to open this egg!,"If it weren't so hard to open, it would be great! I read the reviews that said the same, but couldn't find any other egg you could open, so tried my luck. We've worked on it and it's better but really not well designed, though a fun idea. My 3 year old is still having fun with it it despite the design flaw."
3,Disappointingly expensive,"This toy looks like so much fun and it is, for a 4-5 yr old because they don't notice the immediate dings, which appear, on the egg shell. When the toy arrives, even the adults can't help but play with it because it's so cute to pretend to crack and bake the egg. It's quite expensive per egg. It took only a few days after we received the toy to notice little dings on the egg. We've had it for 3 weeks now and the egg no longer looks like an egg. It's all dinged up. (I only have one child who's been taught to be gentle on the toys.) I don't think my daughter minds the dings much, but it sure does not look like and egg anymore and it's a disappointment b/c it was an expensive purchase (we purchased several). I don't recommend it for that kind of money."
3,My 20-month nephew loves this toy!,"It is about the size a real, medium size egg. I wish that I had bought more than one, (it would have been cute to have a dozen in a carton) but the price was too expensive. As for durability, the felt ""egg"" is going to get dirty and I'm not sure if it is washable. I gave a low educational rating because I'm not sure what a child could be learning from this. But, it does look like a real egg. I bought it for him to enjoy and he defiantly does! Still, because of the price, I don't think I'd buy another."
4,THIS IS WORTH YOUR $$$$$$,"I gotta tell ya, there is only about 2 songs on this album that are beyond the average, but these 2 songs are worth the money. I'd tell you the names of the songs but you'll know it when you buy the record. Here's the deal, Sun Doobie was part of the Cypress Hill crew but was too young when Cypress became big, at least that's what I heard somewhere down the line. There is heavy Cypress Hill influence, but Funk Doobiest has a more comical take (not so gangster). Give it a listen and give the guys mad credit. There are alot of punks making too much money in rap today and Funk Doobie is one of the unsung heros. Bring the REAL back."
1,"Very poor software, privacy is an issue also","This program does not work, the creators are more interested in having you enter codes and wasting time to protect what is essentially a very average Excel file. Additionally, my computer firewall alerts me to macros within the program trying to communicate via the internet. Is it phishing, or whatnot, I can't tell since I'm not a computer guy. Save your money for a program that works."
1,Romans 14:11,"Apparently the authors of this book were hallucinating when they thought it was worth publishing. Jesus Christ is Lord and is ALIVE!!! if you want true evidence of this fact, open your Bible and put down this book.""`As surely as I live,' says the Lord,`every knee will bend to me,and every tongue will confess and give praise to God-Romans 14:11."
3,If you're interested in the best case for both sides,"For the casual browser who might not have noticed, the publisher of this book is InterVarsity Press, a publisher of evangelical Christian books. As a work presenting the Christian apologetics case, it is fine, but if you're interested as well in the best argument for the other side, there is plenty available elsewhere. InterVarsity is not going to publish a debate in which the opposing side gave a strong performance."
1,Not what I wanted ?,I thought I was purchasing the live concert I saw when CSN&Y; was on tour that year. Instead I got a documentary of the tour.So I am very disappointed?
3,Saudade,"Besides remarkable song writers, csny know how to exploit the music to delate politicians crimes. And they have done this over the last five decades with geniality. In spite of being a bit excessive long playing, this video brings back to memory through notes the dark days that menaced the world and the man kind. The flash of old and new images make us traveling in time. The songs are terrific..."
1,De Ja Vu,"I think the Audio De Ja Vu album is one of the best things ever done.What an incredible disappointment to see this DVD. It had little to nothing to do with the CD. It was just a bunch of random takes thrown together, that were trying to relive the anti war scenarios from the past. This was an awful DVD. Boring beyond belief."
2,This Settles the Debate-Original IS Better than Extra Crispy!!!,"Oh My God.....Please...Remember these guys the way they WERE....The exception being Neil Young, who is still plenty relevant....If you're looking for music, there isn't much here....Lots of social commentary....I am in line with their views politically, but don't really need to see/hear it on DVD....This does have some relevance....Not so much musically, though...If you want that, go to see Neil sometime!!!"
3,where's the music,"interesting documentary, but would have liked more music. neil should have released this as a 2 dvd set, one disc with the documentary and the other disc, the full concert."
2,Waste of time...,"I love CSNY and based on the title I was hoping to see footage with all 4 on stage again...playing their wonderful tunes...expectations of a ""4-Way Street"" type reunion.But instead of a concert, this DVD is 'about' the nationwide Iraq tour, almost nothing in the way of music except some snippets from the ends of songs and interviews with fans outside the venues. Talky and boring.Sorry Neil, but this is a real waste of a DVD. How about releasing the actual concert footage?"
3,Wondering why?,"Me and the boy's go a long ways back. Just don't know why they have never had a CSNY DVD concert footage on the market. And though i understand and would expect their events to be political in their music..But, doesn't have to incite riots..Doesn't work anymore. But,when they come, i will be there."
2,"Too much politics, too little music","I bought this DVD hoping to see a CSNY concert. What I got was a political lecture. Even though I totally agree with CSNY's politics, I found the movie to be boring. Needs more music. 'Nuff said."
1,"Something is rotten in Denmark, Neil","I'm sure I would give this DVD a higher rating if I could actually SEE it. However, both the copy Amazon sent me and the replacement copy I also received would not play on my DVD player. (I have never had similar problems with any other DVD I own.) The disks, despite no apparent defects, would rattle around but not actually load up. Given the content of the film, and this being an election year, I'll confess to feeling a mite paranoid. So I guess I'm being a kind of whistle-blower here. I really would like to see this documentary, but Amazon said they won't send a second replacement copy. I'll try to contact Lion's Gate and Neil's people as well. Has anyone else experienced these difficulties?"
1,WASTED ON THE WAY,"A WASTED OPPORTUNITY FOR CSNY TO SHOW US THEY STILL CAN ROCK.THIS IS A POLITICAL FILM ,FROM JUST ONE SIDE.FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS NOT.NEIL TRYEDTO IMPOSSED HIS POINT OF VIEW ON US.NEIL IT DID NOT WORK.EVERYBODY THAT HAS SEEN IT IN MY HOUSE ,HATED THIS DVD.I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED,I EXPECTED A GREAT CONCERT.LETS IMPEACH NEIL YOUNG FOR LYING."
3,Expected more music.,"As a loyal C,S,N & Y fan and I did see the concert live in California, I was a little disapointed. I guess I expected to see more concert footage as it was really a great concert and really got their message across. I really liked the interviews and the message that Neil is trying to get across to everyone but just expected something that wasn't there."
3,C.S.N.Y.,"For the record, I am the ultimate CSNY fan. Have all there recordings, seen them live in concert- in various formations, etc. This is basically a political statement from Neil Young- and this is fine, & it is done well. I was looking for a lot more concert footage. There was some, but not nearly enough. So........if you are a fanatic fan...you will enjoy this. If you are like myself- not enough concert footage."
3,To many runs,Smokie is a talent. But he's voice can get on your nerves. Too many runs. Smokie just sing the songs!
5,Nothing better,"I fell in love with Rain - it's a beautiful, light essence. Much better than the heavy, gagging ""perfumes"" Like as Opium. It can be augmented with other similar scents such as Terra Nova Rain Flowers to heighten the scent, but I love it on its' own. It's the only scent I wear."
2,Terra Nova Rain Essence,I was looking to purchase perfume Terra Nova Rain and the roll on essence smells good but goes quickly. Would have preferred a one ounce bottle of perfume.
5,Terra Nova,"Product is not easy to find in stores so I was delighted to be able to finally have it again. Product came well packaged and, though not quickly, it did come as advertised. Will recommend this company."
5,Fast paced military thriller...,"Jericho Gambit is a high intensity, fast paced military thriller about a terrorist attack on the US and the heroic response by the military and intelligence communities. The characters are likeable, the settings are realistic, and the action is heart stopping. The novel involves some graphic fight scenes, but the story is compelling and fascinating. Combining military expertise, a suspenseful plot and excellent writing, this novel is a must-read. Highly recommended!"
5,The Song From Meredith Brooks!,This song is her best! The lyrics are well written! I truly belive the words contain a common feeling among many women! (Not to mention men!)
4,i remember you,In my opinion i like brian's voice and he's very talented and for the person who said he is whining obviously he's not in LOVE be cause basically it's just album for if you are with your girl and you want to make her feel like she is special and let her know how much you love her or if you are alone sitting at home and your in the mood or you want to relax then listen to this album it's a winner .
4,Classic R&B,This cd is a great return to classic R&B. It is soulful and meaningful music. Something you don't get in the music today. Great cd!
3,Decent Follow Up although not as strong as the first,I Remember You was Brian McKnight's sophmore CD to his excllent self-titled debut. I Remember You featured the single On Thw Down Love and the huge hit Crazy Love. I can't really remeber any other strong material but neverless the less still a good CD.
3,Defending Brian Mcknight,"To Rich from Boston, I think your taste in music is up your a**You are entitled to your opinion, but what your so-called reviewabout Mr McKnight is uncalled for. You must have eaten some rotten clam chowder. That's all I have to say. Aight??"
2,good set but...,Not a complete set -- no bed sheet included. Unfortunately I did not notice that untill I opened the bag...
2,Wait for Win 7 Specific Driver,"We bought HP's BIJ2800 printer because it prints wide format up to 13 x 19. Problem is, if you use Win 7, only a generic driver is available that comes with Win 7. HP does not have a BIJ2800 specific driver for Win 7. The current Win 7 generic driver does not allow printing 13 x 19, and does not know the BIJ2800 can duplex print.HP does have a BIJ2800 XP driver that works if you are using Win XP.So if you need a wide format 13 x 19 printer and are using Win 7 (or about to upgrade) - wait until HP comes up with a Win 7 driver that allows this printer to fully function."
1,Flee At Once!!!!,"I've had this machine for less than 2 years and the duplexer failed. Now I can't find a replacement part for it. They have discontinued the printer and didn't bother stocking in parts necessary to support it.I'm a retired Army officer who is highly trained and experienced in logistics at the installation, state and theater of operations levels. If the Army ran it's replacement parts the way HP does, we'd all be speaking either German or Japanese now.Based on this level of 'support', I'm not buying another HP product ever again.....and I counsel others to be VERY CAREFUL about buying their products as well."
1,Science Fiction,"The review says ""Think of the food replicators in the imaginary future of Star Trek--with some basic chemical building blocks and simple rules, those machines can produce everything from Klingon delicacies to Earl Grey tea. If scientists can understand and apply the knowledge they gather from studying emergent systems, we may soon witness the development of artificial intelligence, nanotech, biological machines, and other creations heretofore confined to science fiction."" -- What?? Like we are about to make food replicators because of the ""deep understanding"" that we now have of emergent systems??I agree with the other reviewer who says the book is characteristically weak. The cover is prettier than Hidden Order. But so what.There have to be better books on complexity than this for the average popular science reader."
2,Toss Up,"Parts of this book were interesting, but overall it was much ado about not much, and what was done was often overdone (I agree with another reviewer on this point). I see that Amazon has coupled this book with Hidden Order. I can't see why. It would be like buying the same book twice. Anyway, so much of this has been warmed over so many times now that it's frankly a bit dry. I'd like to see a book that really breaks new ground in complexity without overusing buzz words or talking down to me, holding my hand through simple things. Here, the topic is more attractive than the content I'm afraid. Anyone really interested in complexity and emergence will need to go into technical details well beyond this book. Others, like me, will likely find the details that are here to be a bit tedious."
5,Another great book by Holland,Expands on Holland's previous book Hidden Order. It presents an interesting method for understanding complexity and emergence. Highly recommended for those attempting to understand complex adaptive systems.
3,Not what exactly was offered,"I bought a book from Betterworld books, when I got it it did not have the dust jacket on it, this was not mentioned in the ad and was downright deceitful."
3,"Interesting premise, but doesn't necessarily come through in the execution...","Overall, this is an entertaining enough book, with a good fundamental idea, though the writing comes off as academic and self-conscious. That this book was a collaboration between a photographer who'd come up with the idea over the course of a few years and an academic approached to develop a narrative around certain key themes is often very apparent; while many of the photographs, even though reproduced in grainy black and white, are soulful and evocative for any man who has spent time in these ""hiding"" places, the accompanying text is often very dry, convoluted, and tangential to the respective chapter's topic."
5,The Brahms not found in most biographies !,"Read the book in the college library 45 years ago. In the book, Shauffler details a Johannes Brahms not found in most biographies. There are incidents in his early life dealing with his attitude toward women ( and, of course, much later in his relationship with Robert and more especially, Clara Schumann.) There is also a number of stories related to his tour with the violinist Joachim. Details of his meeting with Johann Strauss Jr., his reactions to his own symphonies, his attitude toward his students, reasons why he never married, his early career as a pianist in ""sporting houses"", his relationship with prostitutes, why he could never marry. There are many technical details about his music that are perfectly understandable to musicians as well as most laymen. A book for the ages if you are interested in the life of Brahms."
5,Alive,Truly anoited cd. God has blessed Mr. Brooks with exceptional talent and with a calling to inspire the world to seek Him.
3,"Good animation, but kinda sissified","The fight scenes were pretty good, and the animation is incredible, but there was just something inherently wrong in this first installment of the series. Ken and Ryu had some major homoerotic moments, especially when they were ""sparring."" I'm not saying there's anything WRONG with that, it's just unexpected."
5,Neglected Master of the Short Story,"These are absolute gems, and whenever I see someone reading John Cheever or Raymond Carver I tell them to put those overrated hacks away and to check out John O'Hara."
5,Great reading,Really love this book. It's lots of fun to read and very interesting. My husband and I both were married once before and those people were in a different birth order than we each are...so it really did seem to fit for us with regard to our first marriages and our marriage to each other. My husband is the youngest of 4 and I am the oldest of 2. This has been a much better marriage than our previous marriages. Really enjoyed the book.
2,It was the wrong edition,"Because there was no photo, I mistakenly bought the wrong edition of this book and am very unhappy with the 7 books I bought."
2,Shrug. You might like it.,"This has some interesting information. I think a lot of the birth order theory is pretty accurate; it actually did make me feel better to know my perfectionism is partially due to my first-born status, and therefore not ENTIRELY my fault!That said, the writing is tripe. The language is incredibly cheesy, VERY pop, and very simplistic. It's bland, and the author's sense of humor and cultural references are VERY grounded in his generation (which just makes him sound annoyingly out of touch). He also draws excessive attention to himself, his family, and his accomplishments, and he name-drops a LOT. Good lord, who on earth is impressed by that?It's a fine book for the info, as long as you like pop psychology, pay as little attention to the writing as possible, and have a LOT of patience."
5,Great book for Parents -- Whether you have 1 child or 10!!,"This is a great book to read when you wonder why your children are like they are. Dr. Leman colorfully illustrates every example from stories of his childhood, or stories other parents have shared. I laughed almost the whole way through it. The book is a great, inexpensive, gift for parents! I would advise this book to everyone. Even if you aren't a parent, and I'm not, this is still a great book. If you wonder what will motivate your employees, this will give you some ideas. Once you read this book you will end up analyzing your spouse, close friends, parents, and children...and you may start to understand them a little better!!"
4,Rugged case with only a few shortcomings,This case is VERY durable. It supplies complete protection for your Zen. It would be perfect except that the reset button can not be accessed with the case on and the screen protector is clumsy when getting the Zen in. It is not attached to the case so you must position it correctly while trying to get the Zen in. The screen protector also seems to scratch easily. This case is worth the money though and is tougher than any I have seen. The beltclip is also a strong one that swivels freely.
3,Erratic early work by a Brazilian rock martyr,"Raul Seixas was one of Brazil's real rocknroll madmen, following in the footsteps of Lou, Iggy and the Dolls... This early stuff from the mid-late 1960s is mostly pretty tame, though, still too mired in the ""jovem guarda"" teenpop scene of the time. It's interesting if you're already on a Seixas kick, but doesn't really stand out on its own... it's his later stuff from the early '70s that's really the most interesting."
2,Take it in moderation,"The book is clear and describes a lot of interesting exercises but doesn't translate into a realistic program.For instance, in the chapter on ""Backpacking, Hiking and Snowshoeing"" you are supposed to work up to a routine of 23 exercises. Since most of these are for 2-3 sets of 12+ reps, if you take six seconds per rep, this works out to 55 minutes of actual exercise time--not including any rest intervals or time to switch weights, etc. Seems like a lot of time to train for, well, walking.A good book for choosing rehab & injury prevention exercises, but I wouldn't base a whole fitness routine on it.John"
1,Disappointed,"I have used other Hyland products with good results, however, this product did absolutely nothing for me. I bought the 3 pack and can't imagine that I will ever use them."
3,There are no side effects to this stuff but...,There are no side effects to this stuff but it doesn't work all that well either. Good for very mild congestion but that is about it.
1,Terrible,"Besides the horrible acting and directing, this movie has zero to do with the real killer Edward Kemper. Do not bother wasting your money on this."
1,Kemperfied,"I think the people who made this film should be very embarrassed. Not accurate at all. The only truth in it was the fact that they had his name right. And, my God Ed was 6' 9"" tall and they get a 5' 8"" man to play him. How pathetic! Get your facts straight before making a film!"
1,awful...terrible...junk...waste of time...I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"""based on true events..."" blahhh! serial killers are fascinating individuals, and i have read a lot about edmund kemper. i was excited to find this dvd but was soon let down. i figured that since lions gate put out the movie that it would be good. NOT AN OUNCE OF GORE OR NUDITY! everything in this video is common knowledge. dont waste your money or time!"
4,Another good book in the series,"Again, some color photos would have rated 5 stars. There are no pictures of prototype models here, and only one photo of a most interesting failure, the Marlin. But you just don't see Ramblers anymore, and they were really good looking cars, unlike any others, especially in the 60's. I encourage Rambler and/or independent make fans to buy this book. There is of course, a good introduction and lots of knowledgeable text throughout."
4,A light evening's read (and picture book for the AMC/Rambler fan)...,"A light once-over of the Rambler model and make from its introduction to the last US car to carry the name. As others have said, some color pictures would have been preferable. Still the collection of photographs gives a pleasant ( if not complete or comprehensive) overview of the line over its near-20 year run.A nice addition to the AMC/Rambler fan's collection, but not sufficient as a stand-alone volume. A pleasant trip down memory lane for those who owned one (or more)."
3,great reference book/not much of a text book,"As I see it, text books are meant to instruct the readers on the rules and such surrounding a specific subject. This book covers such a broad swath of topics that it is nearly impossible for the author to spend enough time on each individual topic. If you are looking for a reference book that has a good set of condensed equations, tables, and figures, this is a good book for you. However, if you actually want to learn about viscous fluid flow, you should probably look at another book."
2,No Examples,"I can follow most of the math. It's usually good about showing enough work on the derivations. Unfortunately this book has almost no examples; I would bet there are a dozen half assed examples in the entire book. Also this book does not discuss or use tensors which is how my professor does all his derivations. It would make a much better reference book for someone who already knows what they are doing, than a text book."
3,Viscous Fluid Flow text,"This text does cover viscous flow topics very thoroughly but sometimes a little difficult to follow. Very few examples, but a good text for an upper level class. Not for an intro to viscous fluid flows."
4,A beautiful ring but runs alittle big,"I ordered a size 6 as this was a gift but it fits my ring finger and i wear a size 7. I actually expected the stones to be a bit smaller but was surprised by the size and very pleased. If you wear a size 6 I can guarantee it will fit a size 7 finger, so i would order a size down."
5,Cuts clean and saves a lot of time,"I redid all of the galvanized water pipes in both of my bathrooms and in my attic with 1/2"" CPVC, and this tube cutter made my job a lot easier. The blade cuts through the pipe clean and easy. It's durable and feels very solid. It took me a minute to catch on that you have to spread the handles apart to open the blade, but once I did snipping the pipe was quick and easy. I would recommend this product for any DIY project that involves CPVC."
4,Good basic cutter,Works well but I had to loosen the blade very slightly to get it to work. It does cut clean...just keep it straight to get a good cut.
1,Broke during third cut,"The third time I used it it would not go completely through the 3/4"" sch40 PVC I was cutting. After I pulled the partially cut PVC off the blade the reason was obvious, a crescent-shaped chunk of the cutting edge about 1/2"" long had broken off the blade at about mid-point on the blade."
5,Works Well,"Having always used a saw or hacksaw and never having used a tubing cutter before, I was a bit skeptical. I'm building an Aquaponics system and expect to make a lot of PVC cuts. I tried this cutter out on two inch, schedule 40 PVC pipe. It worked great! Much less effort than a saw. Much cleaner cut. And a much straighter cut with a little care. I expected to have to exert a lot of effort to cut a 2"" pipe, but with the ratcheting mechanism it was pretty easy. For the price I think it is an awesome buy."
2,Standard quality cutter,"I expected Wolverine products to a little better quality than what I received. In fact it was not packaged as a wolverine product, but had another label. Probably should have sent it back, but it does look like the picture and I needed a cutter. It is a little better than the cheap ones at Home Depot or Harbor Freight, but I would buy a sturdier one next time."
2,lots of information but poor organization and writing,"I love penguins and so does Ron Naveen. His admiration for these small creatures and his awe of them and the environment in which they live is palpable in this book. Regrettably, although there is alot of good information in his new book, it is poorly organized; the writing is frequently mediocre or worse, and it is terribly repetitive. What it needs is a good editor."
2,penguin stories,"This book was a gift when I returned from Antarctica. I just couldnt get into it. It was interesting for a short while, then I put it away - I'll go try it again at a later date."
2,Recycled sound!,I'm surprised by the comments from most reviewers claiming this to be a new sound. No way! Check out Moloko who basically defined this style of music. Boomkat is a blatant rip-off!
4,Taryn Delivers,"I just purchaced this cd yesterday and I think I've listened to it about 3 times now. The beats are very good- fun to dance to and other wise- and the voice of Taryn Manning are very original. The only complant that I have about the cd are the lyrics. Most of them are pretty immature, but I'm sure as time goes on and more music is written Boomkat will grow."
3,boomkat,"if kellin stopped doin vocals this would get a 4 or 5 out of 5. his vocals ruin great songs like what u do 2 me and the entire c.d in general. otherwise it was a good debut c.d and i think taryn manning will be at the same level as jlo very soon in terms of all around dominance in the entertainment industry (movies, music etc.)"
3,Moloko did this 6 years ago,"Admittedly I haven't listened to the entire album. But I did find ""The Wreckoning"" a catchy song and mildly entertaining video which is why I did more research. Listened to a couple more tracks and couldn't figure out why this stuff sounded so familiar. Is it just me or do these guys sound too much like Moloko. The similarity is shocking though Moloko are far more varied and better IMHO. Guess most people in the US and those who caught Boomkat off MTV (myself included) think this stuff if fairly fresh because Moloko never got a fair push Stateside. I would even suggest Taryn is riffing off of Roisin Murphy's visual style."
1,what is this world coming to?,"ok, this is a disaster. i very rarly hear records i hate, but this is one of them. i almost shriked when i heard move on. she can't even hold a note? and tthe wrekoning? please! i was twitching!!! taryn maning cannot sing, and when she said that she didn't get a record deal because she was an actress, she had to have the talent to back it, it only goes to show you that she really will belive anything her yes-men tell her. her brother, whatever his name is, provides a teeny tiny ray of hope coz he can rock the synthisizers, but seriously folks! get a f*ckin guitar in the studio!!!! then add some bass and a bit of rythim! blech. imagine the 80's with a dying animal pretending to sing. don't waste your money."
1,Drum Machine Music - heard it a million times,I see nothing new or innovative with this band. The lead singer Taryn appears to be trying to mimic the black sound. There is absolutely nothing new or original in any of the songs on this CD. There doesn't appear to be any REAL instruments being played just prefabricated drum\synth music. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
4,Boom,"For an album that not many people have talked about I Must say I was pleasently surprised at boomkatalog one.. Once again Dreamworks has managed to find a female vocalist ( Taryn Manning) who combines great looks , funky beats , and a very unique but very nice voice.( see Nelly Furtado) . Boomkat surprised me very much with solid songs like Wastin My time , and Crazylove, and knockout tracks like the wreckoning , and understand this. If you like something a little bit eclectic and refreshing, than you should purchase this cd, I like it .Taryn Manning is 1 girl I don't mind padding her pockets."
5,Addictive Tunes,"I bought this CD because I had read about Boomkat on Rolling Stones Magazine and really liked the cover. I also thought it was cool how they are siblings. After listening to the CD for the first time I haven't been able to stop playing it. At home, at school, in the car. Contrary to what the previous person said I think the ballads are pretty cool. The beats are really REALLY addictive. Just an overall well put CD. Highly recomend."
2,Simplistic and law-focused,"We bought this as a gift for our visiting grandchildren, but probably won't send it home with them. What we've read thus far could pretty much be covered in two sentences. ""They didn't obey. God punished them."" I realize that to begin at the beginning, one must go through the Old Testament (and we're certainly not asking anyone to just gloss over sin) . . . but, even in the beginning, God wasn't all lightning bolts."
3,Grammy's gift,"This is a good first Bible. It has very short stories of the more popular ones from both the old and new testament. There are questions at the end of each story, also for the reader and the child to discuss which helps too. The handle has already broken and my granddaughter has only had the book 2 weeks. It is plastic instead of leather, which I had hoped it would have been when I ordered it. I paid a little extra for the book with the handle and the handle was not worth it...had I known it was only plastic, I would have gone with the less expensive book...."
4,For younger children,"Good Bible story book, but not geared for 4 and up as stated. Seems more suited to 2-3 year olds."
2,Alright Bible,This Bible is alright to start out on. When I was reading it to my daughter I did find something in it that was not anything like it was intended to mean from the KJV.
4,My grandson's first Bible,"Our grandson loved it. He calls it ""his book"" and carries it to his heart. Love that there is a version that helps the little ones start to love Jesus when they're young."
4,cute,very good for small children. Pictures are colorful and wording is easy for small children to understand. Makes for a nice gift
2,Nice pictures but too simplistic even for two-year old,"My wife bought this book as a way of introducing our 2-year-old daughter to the stories of the Bible. The pictures are very nice, but we have been very disappointed. The stories are given in such an abbreviated form that they are almost meaningless. Plan on having to give a lot of background and explanation. Of course, if you wanted a book that gave only the most cursory information so that you could fill in the details and meaning as you see fit, this book may be of use. As for us, we are putting this book away and getting a different children's Bible. This one is not meeting our needs."
2,Extra tracks? Don't waste your time! Buy the 10-c.d. set!,"Hank ranks with Frank Sinatra in 20th Century music. Even the out-of-print ""40 Greatest Hits"" set (a fantastic set) didn't do him justice. Go ahead and buy the ""Complete Hank Williams"" set. A limited number were produced and your grandchildren will listen to Hank. Almost as good as listening to George Washington or Abraham Lincoln."
4,DVD - The Gates of Jerusalem,This DVD was very educational and explained the three world religions who hold ground in Jerusalem. This is a very good tool for Bible study and a good visual teaching aid. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed in this DVD. It was pretty boring and didn't give any of the spiritual symbolism of the gates of Jerusalem which is what I was looking for.
1,Very easy - Not useful for GRE-CS,"Hi,I bought this book with high expectations and finally when I got it, it was really disappointing.The book has two practice tests with full solutions, but the problem is that the problems given are nothing like real GRE-CS test. They are so easy that, I could easily answer many of them even without solving on paper!!!I think the authours are trying to improve our confidence, boost our morale LOL. :)Definitely not worth it.I spent $16.XX on this and I think of it as a bad investment.TitaniumBits and ETS booklet is the way to go I guess..."
5,A visual delight,This book is a delight to the eye and a balm to the artistic soul. It maybe somewhat revisionist in its views of the world but it is a wonderful focus on an important and often ignored artist movement of the nineteenth century. People may hear about Delacroix but so many of the other artist represented in this book are forgotten in most art histories. It was such a pleasure to sit down with this book and just open it at random to enjoy the beautiful images it contains.
5,the one to buy,"I was looking for a book on this subjet to add to my art library and looked through a number of books in the gift shops at the Met, the National Gallery, etc. This one was without doubt my top choice because of the breadth of artists and the quality of the reporductions. Also, the text is informative. I've noticed that it is out of print but if you keep your eye out it pops up from time to time at under $100; I think I bought my copy at The Strand in NYC for about $50."
4,Not enough women !,"Really I'd like to give this 5 stars but for the lack of women it's 4. I feel sort of silly doing so because the art is astonishing and the sheer beauty just magnifies how ""art"" has changed. I wonder if any artist alive today could come close to duplicating these masterpieces. I doubt it. And Mr Davies writing blends with the terrain and subject matter splendidly."
3,12 bucks for one great song,"Let's face it, the original version of Light and Day is an excellent song. The remix is awful. The filler song is just okay. I'd suggest buying the full album to get your money's worth."
1,Drugs? Hippie? Homosexuality?,"I don't know what it is, this music is addictive. At first it filled me with anger and I couldn't stop listening to it. All I thought is these people really need help, are they on drugs? Now I think I need help because I know on the inside I have all this rage, but this music puts a scary smile on my face. I think I just may have to kill myself to put it to an end. Overall just please don't listen to it if you have, you may end up wasting 12 bucks for music that is engineered to make you artificially happy and it just may traumatize you in the wake of a tragic event making you believe nothing bad can ever happen. I hate this. It sucks, someone help me please."
2,"Potential, but this is just nonsense","This song is all Coda. Normally songs are structured Intro-Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Middle 8 (or bridge)- then, usually back to a chorus building up to coda. This song goes Intro-Verse-Two minute Coda. It's not a bad coda, but it's akin to watching the final Lord of the rings movie and everytime one of the 11 ending wraps, you get ready to stand up, only to go ""Whoops, there's still more"". There's a seed of genius here, but it needs some contrast and texture. I appreciate the fact that they are playing with the normal song structure, but not to make it so simplistic. There may be a brilliant album in this group, but this is not it."
1,Polyphonic Crap,"This has to be one of the worst ""Bands"" I have ever heard. Mindless crap rock blaired out from sad hippie cult members. Well Guess what kids, its already been done and probably better. Bottom line, Worst Band Ever. I would have left my public name on my review, but I dont want to ever admit I have listened to this noise the Polyphonic cult likes to call music."
4,Perfect for class!,It had all the right information and the text was perfect. Never used the CD-ROM though. I had to buy a five cd-set separately.
4,Inspirational,"This true story dvd is an inspirational movie depicting hope, where hope is perceived to be lost. The transformation of lost hope into a successful surfing career when life throws us a devasting challenge is awe inspiring.Great Movie for the whole family"
1,Just Read The Book or Watch The Documentary,"This movie was so bland I watched it with a group from school and was the only one who didn't find it gave me an emotional response.I personally think AnnaSophia Robb is better at playing very moody roles (as in ""Bridge To Terabithia"") for some reason she just didn't make a great Bethany. I thought her brothers were the highlight of the film because their proctection of Bethany seemed so real and their emotions so radiating in this surprisingly dry film.I know Bethany Hamilton was pleased with the movie though, which is more important then me being displeased with it."
5,Motivational,"Wonderful movie, can be watched by everyone, no bad words and very motivational. i saw it at the movies and then had to buy it, everyone in it is good looking and nice."
4,great,my children found it a wonderful and inspiring movie and life story for the whole family to watch together as a family
4,A movie to see,"A movie based on a real story that really make you think. It's a chance to reflect on what does really count in life and what is a ""real limit"" to live and be happy."
5,Buying from Amazon.com,"I have definitely enjoyed my purchases from Amazon.com and working with Amazon.com And, i recommend working with them and their customer service representatives."
3,"Well done, if limited","This is a very small film, dealing with a tiny subject that was only a brief glimmer in the pantheon of news. A surfer had lost an arm. That was the extent of the story. In the film, they do a marvelous job superimposing the lost arm on the actress portraying the real surfer in question. The story is told well. If the subject fascinates you, get the DVD; if you are just looking for a DVD for entertainment, keep on looking elsewhere..."
5,soul sufer,soul sufer is a great movie i wonder will there be a soul sufer 2 and i like true true stories
5,Quality movie with a purpose,This is a sweet story of faith and perserverance. My 11 year old has watched it several times already but my older kids also have enjoyed it as well.
4,Inspirational!!,Great movie! I was a little irritated that when I tried to download the movie to my kindle the 1st time it did not work. But other than that NO issues.
4,Very nice without being too sappy,"This is an inspirational film, which is a type that I usually do not care for because they end up being sappy and weepy. Thank goodness this one did not fit into that category. It is uplifting and honest without being gooey or too heavy-handed, and it also addresses the moments of despair that even the faithful will have.Recommended."
5,Super great - suitable for the whole family,"I have seen this movie twice, once with my children (ages 4, 5, and 8) and once with my husband. He's from CA and loves surfing so I thought he'd enjoy it too. It really is a very good movie. The only scary/questionable part is the shark attack, and even that is not particularly GORY. It's just very emotional (especially for me as a mom, when Bethany's mom sees the ambulance carrying her daughter drive by and breaks down... wow). I thought all of the actors did a great job (well maybe not so much the guys playing her older brothers, but they were minor characters really). Even if you are not Christian and do not particularly like ""spiritual"" movies, that's only one element of the story. The real story is about the girl and how she overcomes this event in her life. And really, it's about surfing. I would say at least 25% of the movie is just gorgeous scenes of Hawaiian surfing. You can't really go wrong with that."
3,Soul Surfer,"This DVD was okay...young folks, especially those who are into surfing and beach activities, will really like it. It's a story of courage and overcoming difficulties and this young woman's story is certainly worth seeing at least once before passing it on, but it's not a DVD I'll keep in my collection."
5,Excellent movie for the whole family!,"I saw this the first time in a small theater in Seal Beach, CA; loved it, as did everyone in there with me, clapping and shouting at the end of it. Then I watched it on the beach at the Isthmus, on the beach, out under the moon and stars. It was just as inspiring the second time, and we all clapped at the end. Not a bit 'cheesie', with truth that you can take to your heart, AND lots of great surfing, by Girls; yeah!"
4,Really Enjoyed This Movie,My entire family really enjoyed this movie. I think it makes a difference when you know it is based on a true story and that people with true courage and integrity still exist in this world.
5,inspiring,This is a heartfelt true story. Tragedy to Triumph.Redemption and courageous Soul Surfer. Must see! You will not be the same.
5,I loved this movie.,I watched this movie twice when it came out in the theater. I had to own it and watch it again because it makes you see that thru the trials in life somethings can be turned into good and having faith and will power to overcome even what seems impossible. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire.
5,Review,"Awesome, the movie makers did a great job with Bethany's story and the movie came to me in good condition...thanks"
5,Emotionally Gripping,This movie will take you from cheers to tears and back again. A truly amazing story about overcoming the worst and demonstrating perseverance!
5,Very good movie,Soul surfer was a very good movie. It caught my attention right away. I am soo happy with the ending.
4,Movie as a gift,"My niece always wanted to get this movie for her ""favorite dvd collection"" and I felt this purchase couldn't of been a better gift."
3,ok,"The cinematography was great. Acting ok. The thing that really creeps me out is when they emphasize religion. Jesus had nothing to do with your recovery. Human resilience is an amazing thing, and under dire circumstances the human body can overcome incredible strain. Why did she need god to find herself? Simple: she didnt. it was her hard work and effort that made her rise above the rest. if you want something badly enough, eventually you will get it. Nothing to do with a mythical fairytale that supposedly happened 1200 years ago(ie the bible). I guess if people want to continue to participate in religion, they have to at least realize religion divides far more than it unites and just using the good side of religion doesn't mean you are doing a good thing for yourself and the world."
5,facing adversity & making it your friend..,"I very rarely pay to go to the theatre- never in my life have I paid to see a movie 3 times, until this one.. I would rather my teenagers fill thier mind with something as this than the majority of what's out there! The best part about it, is this is how Bethany really handled what she went through. If you want to be truly inspired.. this movie is a MUST see.. no need to waste time on reading comments- check it out for yourself!"
5,Great family view,"Great movie for family movie night. This was purchased for my 15 year old granddaughter as a Christmas gift, what a hit...she loves it."
5,Best Movie of the Year,"This movie was both motivational and inspiring. A great flick. I even shed a tear and as a grown man that is not easy to do. The acting was excellent, the story is awesome. Overall 10 stars. A must see movie. Get it nowSoul Surfer (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"
5,Good movie for the whole family,"Nice story and cleanly presented. Why anyone would have a problem with this girl's true life story is beyond me? The crew is a wonderful collection of fine actors and the story is beautifully told. Yes, she is a Christian and that fact is included in the movie but it is not shoved down anyone's throat. She is a blond and surfs. Those are as much a part of who she is as her faith is. It is her story, a true story. Get over the race and faith of the real person already. Too often people give up their dreams as problems occur. Here is an uplifting story of a young person dealing with their pain and loss successfully."
5,"Ummm, WOW!!!","I didn't know who Bethany Hamilton was when I saw this movie. She is now an inspiration to me. This movie sucks you in from moment one. It has a great cast. I love how they put God, worship, and trials to face into this movie. My most favorite line in the movie is when her mom and her were lying on her bed and she asked ""Mom, what guy will ever want me like this?"" And her mom replied...well watch the movie and you will know :-)"
4,great perfromace by AnnaSophia,"I was really impressed by AnnaSophia Robb's perfromance in this movie. Also I really liked the message that was portrayed in the movie by her family, and the support of them also."
5,Soul Surfer (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo,Soul Surfer should be watched by every young person for very positive re-enforcement principles. It shows in a positve way that a person can over-come unseen obstacles with a positive drive and decision. Very good movie.
4,"Intense, but has a good message","This movie is intense, a bit scary, but sends a good message. I only reccomend this to kids at least 8 or 10 years old because of the shark scene and they might get a little bit bored with it. I did get a little bored, but I still reccomend it. Although the movie is filled with women and girls in skimpy bikinis, it still sends a good message that all things are possible with God."
2,"Great story, mediocre movie","A great inspirational story but a mediocre, predictable script and listless directing. My dog could have written that hackneyed script. I guess Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid need a paycheck."
1,Boring,"It's a shame that a movie about such an inspiring young woman is flat and boring with little insight into any of the characters. The other one-star reviews have described it perfectly, and I can only reiterate that it is a waste of time."
5,Amazing,I never leave the house without this on. It's light and gives a healthy glow for day or night. I'm very upset that this been discontinued.
2,not as good as the little peoples farm book,My son and I have really enjoyed the Little People Lift Tabs books but this one was not as enjoyable as some of the others.
1,Disrespectful!,"The first activity in this book shows community members at work. The baker is next to her oven, the barber is next to his chair and the police officer....is asleep on the job! I am not kidding. These men and women put their lives on the line everyday and deserve our respect. Fischer Price has chosen to portray them with their feet up on their desk and their eyes closed!"
3,Daughter not Impressed,The items found under the flaps didn't impress my daughter as much as I thought it would. She does enjoy the graphics and enjoyed identifing the characters and things in the book.
2,Some Solid Truths; Bad Writing,"This author correctly assembles proofs that the stock market has times of enthusiasm and times of discouragement. All investors should surely know that. The proofs dispose of the idea that ""Buy and Hold"" will always make you rich. Unfortunately, though, some of the over-elaborate graphics are no help at all, and the author' style is both condescending and irritating."
3,Good with a small problem.,Good feel to them solid body.It might have just been me but I felt the fins were not thatgreat of quality they came apart I had to order new ones.
3,ok,"loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks"
5,BRINGS BACK WONDERFUL MEMORIES,I have loved Shenandoah from day one. It's great to listen to them all day with this CD. Thanks for some great songs.
5,perfect!!!!,I absolutly love this cd. I love a cd where you can listen to every single song and not have to skip through. They harmonize so well. These songs are so great. One of my fav cd's. You should buy this cd now.
5,OUR Navy needs to come of age....,"I was very impressed with the author's writing style. Her story is one that needs to be told and she shows much courage in the telling. The Navy, like all our institutions, must move into the 21st Century and away from the ""good ol' boy"" management style that has prevailed far too long. Beth Coye gives a sound and eloquent discussion of the problems involved. Her story draws the reader in with each event. She is to be applauded for her fine book. I recommend it highly.joemurphy33@yahoo.com"
3,Good history and story but poor officer attitude,"I enjoyed the historical perspective of reading about female officers a decade before I came along. The unique letter format of this book is well done and easy to follow, if a bit too long. But the whiny attitude got to me. It seems the protagonist spent her whole career thinking about her future and running to her admiral buddy for help. She also slams naval aviators. For those interested in learning about the next generation of female Navy officers, my memoir, ""Navy Greenshirt: A Leader Made, Not Born,"" offers a different perspective. ""My Navy Too"" does not represent all women officers."
1,Reader Rabbit Math Ages 6 -9,"I was not happy with this as I could not get it to work on my laptop. I tried different ways to make it work, but it would not...."
5,6 Bullets,"well worth the price, no scratches, nicely packaged. My husband collects his movies & i didnt wanna pay new price."
4,Normal Movie,I have always been a VanDam fan therefore I wanted to see this movie. It was fairly predictable for me but I have an infair advantage to most people because I have seen ALL of his movies. He played a good part and in my opinion is a good actor. He used more weapon than Karate skills as this character.
4,Joe Flanigan rocks!,"I have to admit that I bought this movie as a fan of Joe Flanigan. Not really a fan of fighter films or JCVD films. I was pleasantly surprised that I found the movie engaging all around. Sad that it deals with an issue of human sex trafficking, but the movie dealt with the topic on a more personal level. All the acting was very good--I think Joe Flanigan was cast really well--he brought depth and real emotion as the frustrated, proactive distraught father of the abducted girl. Overall a decent film, I think will satisfy JCVD fans, Joe Flanigan fans and the casual viewer!"
3,Not bad,Good action film with more character development and plot than I expected. Not the easiest film to watch considering the subject matter -- human trafficking -- but worth the time.
5,Great Movie - Right up my alley,I enjoyed the movie very much. It is just what I look for when I am viewing a movie Jean-Claude Van Damme is starring in. If you like action and you like Jean-Claude - it is worth while viewing.
3,unusual,It was a typical Van Damme movie for me. The story line was unusual but a socially current theme in some countries.
1,Be careful!,"I own the this product although I never had the chance to use it, it just sits in storage. Here is what I dicovered about it the version I have (model 903) has a small american flag on it with the words next to it ""made in china"" so if your picking this one over another because you want to buy American made and you see the U.S.A flag be careful!. As far as the product itself goes its glued together so it either sticks or if your's does not stick it means they did a bad glue job also I wouldnt call this the best woodcraft job either the backing does not meet the side ends but its close enough. Mine happen to come with a 2"" split in the wood but its not a full split just half way up on the bottom side which is why I didnt notice it right away."
3,"Lots of Entertainment, but Wood Only Lasts a Few Years","I enjoy this feeder. Brand new, it's a beautiful eastern red (aromatic) cedar. As expected, it's easy to attach to any wooden surface with a couple of screws. I screw cob corn onto the feeder and get visitors all day long, including some feathered friends who like corn as well.Just keep in mind that this is untreated 1/2"" cedar. That's good for the critters, but mine has only lasted about 3 years in normal weather. It weathers to the typical grey color, but has also started splitting. To beef things up, I cut a couple pieces off of a cedar picket and then drilled & screwed them to the bottom of the feeder. That has helped it stay together very well so far. A little bit thicker wood, say 3/4"", would probably help this product stand the test of time a little better."
5,Fuzzy critters...fun watching,"I've never been a fan of the bird feeders that keep the squirrels out. The squirrels enjoying their food is equally important to me. And usually way funnier.This makes things simple, nothing fancy to buy...just put a corn cob on it.And you have instant friends...and families of squirrels.I felt this especially important this summer with a drought where i lived and animals suffering; I actually put several in the woods behind my house as well as in my own animal habitat.I think this would be a great gift for an elderly person...they do seem to stop and enjoy the simple things far more than many."
4,good after an adjustment,This was well constructed and pleasing to the eye; with the exception of pointed screw to place the squirrel food log onto. It seemed like the squirrels would hurt themselves trying to get the food from it the way it came. I went to the hardware store and found a replacement screw with a flat tip for less than 50 cents. The squirrels and chipmunks love it. It's definitely worth it. I will likely order another one.
3,OK,Have a g wireless sys and internal b in my ibook. No appreciable increase in internet loading with adapter and very inconvenient hanging off the side. These adapters stick out and could easily be damaged. at least this one has a u-joint that helps a lot in this respect but had some trouble staying in position set. Not much invested so it was worth a try.
2,Stopped working after only a few months,"I was very relieved to find this product, as I'd also spent a long time looking for a wireless USB adapter that would work for my IBook. It was easy to set up and worked well, until after only a few months it stopped working! I've purchased this item twice and had the same problem both times. Not pleased!"
5,Cheaper than rewiring your house!,"We didn't have an available jack in the bedroom, but this little thing got our Mac desktop on the network with hardly any problems.We have a combined PC/Mac household, and this didn't seem to create any issues."
1,Not 10.5 (Leopard) compatible,I am returning it. I have OS 10.5 (Leopard) but the drivers on the installation CD are for 10.3 and 10.4 only. I could not find updated drivers on the Addlogix website. I would have waited for new drivers if I hadn't seen a review from 9 months ago making the same observation.Don
3,OSX users take note,"The Amazon ad and the manufacturer's site say it is OSX compatible. When you get the package, the box says OSX 10.3 and 10.4 only, and when you read the installation paperwork, it tells you 10.3.9 and 10.4 only. I Never could get it working on my G3 (and don't need it for my G4). Works great on my PC running XP. However, don't use their device management software. It sucks. Windows networking works fine."
1,Not as easy as it sounds....,"I'm giving this wireless adaptor one star to also warn the buyers that not everyone is going to be able to just plug it in and have it work, especially the Mac users with earlier machines like my G4. Additionally the support from Add logix is only online and slow in response. Because I can't stay at my computer indefinitely due to family life and having to go to work, it took me days to install their wireless adaptor. Like a previous reviewer, I ended up having to use a patch they emailed me, after struggling with the device for two weeks. Also the support team is not that sensitive to the average user who doesn't use computer terms or work with software installation on a frequent basis. They will use ""encryption ""code in one message, then ""password"" in the next, which can be confusing to the layman. Eventually the device worked properly; but for me it was after a long and frustrating ordeal; and I'm not a complete novice."
5,What we wanted,"Purchased this pump for use near Kep, Cambodia, at remote weekend homesite on steep hillside. Using to refill garden waterfall reservoir, cleaning, gardening and general utility. Needs are medium water pressure, lift, simplicity, and portability. The first one purchased works so well that now purchasing a second to have two."
3,"Bought September 2011 - Died January 17, 2013",Sad little thing died just at 16 months old. I don't know why. Sucks though 4 sure! Worked great while it worked! I ordered the Flojet replacement. It's only 2.9 gpm so we'll have to see how it goes.
4,Bulb is a bit dim,The mirror installed OK but the wattage of the light used should be greater (like twice the light output) for the price difference with comparable unlighted mirrors. This is something I couldn't tell just from the listing.The wall installation went just fine. There was a slight flaw in the chrome finish but it wasn't so much that I would demand a return or anything.
4,Behind The Scenes With A Man of God,"My name is Dr. Curry R. Blake. I am the General Overseer of Dr. John G. Lake's International Apostolic Council. Rev. Wilford Reidt, the author of this book was a dear friend of mine. The material in the book is not the usual info rehashed into a new form. Wilford wanted to try to reveal some of what Dr. Lake was like and what it was like to see behind the scenes of this ministry. Many heretofore unpublished stories are revealed, as well as some personal observations. There was perhaps no better person to write a book such as this, as Wilford was also married to Lake's daughter, Gertrude. When you complete this book, you will not only know more about Dr. Lake, but you will also feel as though you know him, and you will gain valuable insight into what it takes to carry the healing anointing as this man did. healingrooms@minister.com"
1,Wasn't what I expected,This book did not turn out like I hoped it would. The information provided was the same basic stuff you learn in school and did not teach me anything new. So if i were you buy something else other than this book!!!
2,Hard to follow and gets boring.,"The story is interesting and has real possibilities but the author's style gets very tiring because he jumps from one scene to the next and it is difficult to pick up where you left off before you ""jumped"". His sentence structure, I thought, is incomplete in places and it is difficult to figure out who is talking. All of the effort that goes into trying to figure who is doing what gets very tiring . The story just does not ""flow"""
1,Thomas' Best Book?,"I certainly hope not, because the others must be truly (even more) dreadful. The errors in grammar and in content are appalling. For example, NO American would ever use the very British word 'tetchy'. Was the man writing only for the British reader? Worst of all, the continuous use of comparatives becomes tedious following, say, the second page. Tell me, how does a fire 'roar aqueously'?Perhaps I chanced to pick up the worst of the lot as my introduction to Thomas' novels. In any event, I'm not tempted to explore further."
3,Good but not great,"This album is neither good nor bad. the first six songs are pretty good but after that the album slowly falls apart. ""In the mud"" and ""Third Eye"" are by far the best songs on the album. ""Slide"" and ""Steal my Shine"" shed some light on this Cd, but the rest of it [is just bad]. I first bought this album after the Bizzar/Bizaar tour in 2001. Marz sounds much better live. The lyrics are good for the most part, but what makes this CD fall short is the beats. With the exception of the songs mentioned above, this cd has some horrible beats. Bottom line:If your looking for a good rap/metal band try out Bionic Jive or Hed P.E.. These groups are far much better than Marz."
4,Two words...who-ah!,"I first heard Marz on ICP's tour...he ripped up the stage. I bought his CD not too long after, and it's really good stuff. It's like industrial/acid/rap. The whole CD has a good feel to it. Can't wait to hear some more of his Dark Lotus ..., either!"
1,No secrets just a big con.,Waste of time and money. Worst book I have ever read. No secrets just a big con.
5,Best Book on Increasing your Perception by Remote Viewing.,"This book will not make you an 'Einstein' overnight.Yet,it will increase your awareness of events and presence of objects,from the past and present.People who are closed-minded and expect quick results,will be disappointed by this book.After you read it,and you feel lost or confused,put the book aside.Go about your life and read some other books,other than remote viewing ones.When you're ready for a second closer reading,go for it.Today's ,'Information Overload',may be hampering your mental ability to absorb the steps toward accurate remote viewing.I can only say,this book was helpful and clarifying for me."
5,Essential to any serious student of psi functioning,"Don't be fooled by the title's reference to Remote Viewing. This book is essential to any serious student or researcher in the psychic field. McMoneagle understands the psychological parameters within which the psychic works. It makes no difference if your particular interest in psychic healing, auras or psychometry; what McMoneagle discusses is very relevant to you.I highly recommend this book."
3,What's missing,"I ordered this book from Amazon.comn, thinking it would tell me, as the jacket suggests, how to do remote viewing. I returned it when I found that, while it goes into excruciating detail on all of the external protocols-- like what the other members of the team do- it has very little on the subjective processes, and in fact gives no subjective protocols whatsover. If you want to know more about those things, you're better off doing a search on the web using the keywords remote viewing matrix. I thought I'd better keep myself anonymous, lest the author seeks revenge for this review by remote viewing ME! :)"
4,"A good handbook, but a bit dry.","This is a good handbook, and it is an excellent resource if you wanted to try Remote Viewing yourself. However, it is a bit dry at thimes. It is loaded with all manner of great subjects and specifics related to the ""how to"" of remote Viewing, but this is not a casual book. I would recommend this book only if you were interested in trying to Remote View on your own and wanted a guide to learn how to do it. It gives a great background and history behind the process, but this is certainly not a book for the non-believers or skeptics out there."
3,So what's remote viewing?,"The book is honestly written. Mr. McMoneagle warns the reader over and over that ""remote viewing"" is not something everybody can do, and the very few who can , won't get an accurate hit most of the time.Unfortunately , he doesn't talk much about technique but about protocols and the state of mind of the remote viewer. Having finished the book, I'm still confused as to his definition of remote viewing. It seems to me that good psychics and clairvoyants are able to glean this information all the time although it's not called remote viewing."
5,Finally an objective look at psychic ability,"The most objective and informational book available to date on the topic of remote viewing, written by someone who was there from the beginning.An open-minded and even-handed look at a controversial topic.I agree with a previous reviewer in saying that this book is essential to anyone who is seriously interested in researching psychic ability on a scientific level. Other books by Mr. McMoneagle are also available and worth reading if you have interest in the history of remote viewing."
3,Basic Remote Viewing Book,"Book is OK. I've read others, and it is really fairly complete.Could have more details; lots of stories, etc.Good place to start to learn ARV."
2,Much on protocol - nothing on technique,"The author dissects RV into protocol; how the paranormal ability to view remotely is harnessed, and method; the actual mental technique(s) by which things and events can be viewed remotely.What the book says on protocol is enlightening and probably very helpful to prospective RVs. The author draws on decades of RV success and failures conducted in a scientific manner, and should know what works and what does not.Readers hoping to find pearls of wisdom on how to develop their own paranormal ability are in for a disappointment. Because in this area, the author offers nothing at all."
4,Good science book on a unscientivic topic,"As a psychologie student I've seen te scientivic method being applied to something as complex as the human mind and for parapsychologie it's even more the case. The autor has a kristal clear writing style trying to avoid the vage descriptions psy phenomena are surounded with as much as possible. It remind me of the ""Ganzfeld"" experiments to prove psy existed. Well, psy does exists, it's just not that strong.This book tries to teach you how to train that ability. I personaly like the zen way in wich he teaches it. With a belt system and all.If you dislike the usual houpla surrounding psy try this book or else try ""The Satanic Bible"" by LaVay."
1,The name of this book is miss leading...,As a Shaman Priest I was taught from a very young age how to do remote viewing. Remote Viewing secrets is interesting reading but when it comes down to who can and who can't it is completly off the wall from the way our students learn. I read the book in the local library and suggest anyone to request it the same way before purchasing it. He makes strong points and will let you the reader decide for your self how good the book is for your book shelf.To add to our library here at the temple :) sorry there is no way.LA SP
3,A little to much procedure,"He went into the all of the aspects of remote viewing with out actually getting into the nuts and bolts of viewing. It is more for the experienced viewer. Not for someone just wanting to gain some more insight on RV. There is some very unique insight, however."
4,Good Eyeliner,"I really do like that this eyeliner is not tested on animals and is pretty safe too. I was having trouble finding a completely vegan non-liquid eyeliner but this comes pretty close. I love the way that it glides on smoothly. The only thing I do not like about it is that it does not stay on all day long. I put it on at work in the morning and by the time I get home 9 or so hours later almost all of it has worn off. To be fair, I feel like most eyeliners would also wear off after that long and to this products credit, it is non-toxic and not tested on animals so I still feel that it is worth it and probably would buy it again."
5,Great Toy,I bought this for my nephew (5) and he played it until the batteries died and begged for more... it was a fun game and provided him hours of entertainment!
3,Not What I Expected,"The graphics for this toy were really low quality. I expected more given the price I paid. However, my son has gotten some enjoyment out of it but usually only plays it when the DS battery is dead."
2,Not very impressive graphics,"I ordered this for my grandson and while he has not played with it yet, I have. I opened the package to install the batteries as they are not included. I tried it out, and the graphics are extremely small ""pencil"" drawings. Also I cannot say that it is especially responsive. I felt bad enough about this gift that I got him a second gift from V Tech which is very nice and works very well!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this toy for my four-year-old grandson for Christmas. It has to be the worst toy I ever bought. My grandson couldn't figure how to play it, so we passed it around all the dozen adults present. They couldn't figure it out either. Would not recommend for any age! I contacted the seller and was told it couldn't be returned because the package had been opened. This is the last toy I will ever purchase from an Amazon seller!"
4,Unexpected Ending,"I loved this book, but thought that the ending should have been much more developed or even totally different. I loved the different parts, but the ending was totally unexpected for me and I think it should have been much different."
1,Stunningly Dull,"I suppose I'll be the thorn among all the glowing praise for this book, but I found it incredibly dull. Having just ripped through ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" I was hoping to have the same type of compelling experience, but was sadly mistaken. I got virtually no emotion from this book and the historial ""details"" were so general anyone could have thought them up. The dialogue was flat out bad, not at all like the sharply observed voices of ""Goodbar"". This was the writer who, in ""Goodbar"", sardonically described Earth as a ""two bit town"", so I know she has it in her to produce great wit and great phrasing, but none of that was present in this novel. To me, this felt like a dispassionate ""college writing 101"" exercise."
4,I was left feeling shocked and very saddened.,"I enjoyed this book for the most part and am glad to have read it but I was stunned by the ending, not having guessed it for a minute. Very powerful reading."
3,Gripping story - fantastic social history,"I saw a television interview with someone who knew of the real Emmeline, so I'm convinced that it is based on a true story - unbelievable as it seems. The story has had a grip on me ever since - she was a victim of her times, her circumstances, and an incredible, unfortunate twist of fate."
5,The book I recommend for new horse owners,"I recommend this book to all first time horse owners and any horse owner interested in going natural. This is my first choice off the shelf and my go to for most equine problems.While this book doesn't cover more than a sliver of natural medicine, It is an enjoyable read and is a very useful and simple reference book. Pat Coleby only covers in some detail the use of dolomite, seaweed meal, sulfur, vitamin C, copper, and a handful of other items, but they are usually effective as well as cost effective."
2,Have a laxative,"Honestly, this book made me nauseous. While I enjoyed the first three Shannara books, especially the second, this entire new series really turned me off to Terry Brooks in general, as it seems he was milking this for more than he`s worth. All four books could`ve been condensed into a novella; though it probably would have been no pleasanter, at least it would have been mercifully quick. As it is, I slogged through nearly 1000 pages worth of Four Lands mud, blood, and monsters, with dialogue taking a permanent back seat. There was one cheerful moment in the entire series, and that was in the first two pages. The characters were Brook`s typical archetypes with all the verve sucked out of them, and none of them has so much as a smattering of a sense of humor. Basically, this book is for people who feel like a good depression would be right up their alley, or for students who want to work up a headache so they can miss school the next day"
1,Yuck Yuck Yuck Yuck Yuck!!!!,"What went wrong? What was up with that whole four horsemen thing? Why did a good series have to end so badly? Take my advice... read the first three books, then make up your own ending!!!"
2,Yawn,"The plot was on the boring side. The stupid wishsong turned back to normal. And the scions separate for good after the book's over. Well??!! I'm surprised Par was able to use the wishsong at all! If there's going to be another series about the shannarans, some more elven blood would be nice, with the characters wanting to use their magic. 5 stars!!?? You must be kidding. The whole thing was predictable. The parting of the old friends made me feel depressed. Read anything but the Heritage series."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I don't care what people will tell you a bout this book....It's bad. I've waited for 5 years to read it after the publisher here in israel went bank robed and what a waset of money. The characters lose their magic, the plot's disapearing and the ending was so stuipd that only out of respect to the writer after reading ""Running with demones"" I haven't trowe it out of the window. I tell you leave it there's better books around."
4,Brooks finishes the Shannara series with a familiar bang.,"Reading Brook's ""Talisman of Shannara"" was like getting into a familiar warm blanket in the winter. This book beautifully unites the many subplots of the earlier installments and brings the Shannara series to a powerful end but is, unfortunately, getting too repetitive for my tastes. The buildup of the encounter with a monster appears again and again, and the character's seem to posess the same innocent yet duty-bound quality in every book of the Shannara series. However, I still enjoy the suspense and emotional & physical conflict that presents itself in each book. For the newcomer, a world filled with heroes, love, and terror waits. Sometimes his books remind me of the movie ""Willow."""
5,They all come back to settle the score!,"Wren, Walker, and Morgan are back and trying to find Coll and Par. Wren with the secret of the Elves. Walker with the magic of the Druids. And Morgan with the Sword of Leah, fixed by Quickening at her death. Par is miss-lead to think that he had killed Coll when Coll is really being held captive at Southwatch. Wren needs help to defend against the army coming from the south, so she searches for the Free-born to help stop them. Walker is held captive in the Druid Keep Parninor by the four horsemen. A great action packed book!"
2,"more of the same, more of the same, more of...","<sigh> It's sad, really. Terry Brooks has penned some mildly entertaining, albeit not very original, stories in his day, but with each passing novel they grow worse and worse. Now, rather than imitate the-author-who-will-remain-nameless, it seems as if he is imitating *himself*, making for some very poor, and very boring reading.Unless you are one of the slathering Terry-Brooks-can-do-no-wrong fans, I'd suggest skipping this over. Brooks has not improved over the years, and has in fact grown worse, despite what his utterly-devoted-cult will tell you."
1,Looks good...cut lousy!,"I have to duplicate the other poor review of this blade. Although I am not a fabricator I do a few metal projects and was looking forward to a great tool for cutting thin wall tubing. I made 8 cuts on 3"" x 1"" 1/8"" wall tubing and the fist 6 cuts were like heaven, cut like butter. Because I was skeptical about the performance I cut slowly and did not tax the blade and there was plenty of time between cuts, the blade did not get to war to touch. The last two cuts was when the blade gave out. Up to that point no indication of dulling.Save your money!"
2,MORSE STEEL CUTTING BLADE,I DO NOT KNOW IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG BUT THE BLADE CUT GREAT THE FIRST 2 TIMES I USED IT BUT AFTER THAT IT HAS TROUBLE CUTTING THROUGH CLOSET DOOR TRACKS
1,Disappointing and depressing,"Being a big fan of ""Goodfellas,"" I was looking forward to this documentary. Unfortunately, this is pretty dull. Henry is discovered as a cook in a small Nebraska town that has a significant meth problem. This film covers Henry's difficulties in staying straight and his domestic and drug problems, which are more depressing than interesting. Henry mumbles so bad that the film makers were forced to use subtitles for him. There is very little discussion of Henry's ""old days"" in New York and the special features on ""Goodfellas"" are better if that is what you are looking for. Thus, I suggest you skip it."
1,Very boring,"I thought this would be a good DVD but was very dissapointed. This documentary makes the local news look like Emmy Winners.Henry Hill has nothing left to offer anyone and just rambles on about his difficulties in adjusting to ordinary life. He needed subtitles just to make the viewers understand him.Seriously, do not waste your money. You will regret it like I did."
3,"Taste Great, Less Filling","Tasted great, but with so little to eat in the package it is ridiculous that they claim two servings. It is like saying that since a bagel is cut in half it could feed two hungry hikers."
5,A MUST BUY!!!,"This is definately a greatest hits album but not enough hits.A few more Willie songs would have been nice.But still all the tracks are great and plus its Willie,you want be disappointed,trust me."
5,"Super Willie, some of his best hits","I lost the cassette tape of this album a couple of years back, I finally got around to replacing it, this version is the mp3 download. I don't want to loose this again, the sweet sounds of Willie Nelson. I have found memory's of what all of these songs mean for me, and they are wonderful ones at that :). Well worth the purchase, a very nice blend of what I feel is some of Willie's finest music. If you want a nice blend of some of his big hits and some of the classic styles that are the essence of Willie Nelson, these are some of his best.I'll be catching up on some of his tunes now... gotta go."
4,willie nelson super hits,this was in perfect condition and I love it. if you love willie like I do I recommend this cd
3,Nice mix,This is like a Wittman sampler of Willy's good song style .Not to off the beaten path and along the traditional of what you think of as Nelson after he became more of a houshold name.
3,only concern,"I ordered the CHH Imports Cantonese Style Mahjon Set in Vinyl Case. Amazon, as always, was prompt and effecient in delivery. My only concern with this product was the case. The vinyl case has a very deep crease in the bottom as if someone had accidentally cut it with a sharp object. This could have happened during packaging and those things could happen. It is a gift and I am unhappy about giving a gift that is inferior. I also found the case to be very poorly made. One of the corners of the case that holds the pieces in was ripped apart. The quality of the case if poor. That is something I can't fix. I don't have the time to return the item so I have opted to purchase another container for it."
3,It's OK,"I haven't used this set yet, I'm sure it's OK. Now is the time for all good men to come.........."
3,Like the first one,"Like the first one, it is sometimes funny, many times sick. The drawings are sort of crude, but I can see this is the kind of material that has its fans."
4,"Quirky, odd, and if you've got a bit of a sick mind, even hysterical.","Not everyone will love it, but I think its original, fresh, and bizarre in a fun way.I like offbeat humor.For instance I like the movie The Big White with Robin Williams. Its odd like that....."
4,Minhas compras,"Cad o q eu comprei??? Tá demorando demais... e tá dificil descobrir se já enviaram ou nao... Mas, vou tentando até descobrir... A grana ja saiu da minha conta mesmo..."
2,Too small,Too small for an adult and it is not microwaveable. I ordered 4 as a gift and it was my fault for not doing further research.
1,Easily the worst movie ever,"Looks like somebody bought a new camcorder on ebay, and one sunday got together with some (non-actor) friends and filmed this video. Not having a script, they just improvised some silly story as they went along. Now, how did they ever get this piece of junk to be sold by Amazon? I have seen many cheaply made movies, but this is home-made movie is the worst."
1,"Sad, Sorry, and simply AWFULL","This is yet another case of indie urban films gone bad. Bad directing, silly script, medicore acting, and ummmmmmmmmmmmmm yet again bad directing. Dont waste your time or money! The lead actress slowly gets better through out the film but I guess theres only so much you can do with a suckie (lack of a better word) script!!!!!!!!! I recently asw another film by the same director. The lighting in this film was awful. It seems like it was filmed by a cam corder. Horrible visual/sound effects. As for the acting? Again I say you can only do so much when the script just sucks!!!! I hope this guy is getting paid well! Atleast that would answer why he's flooding the market with garbage other than just because he can........."
5,DAISY,"One of the best Korean movies to date, I really enjoyed it, although it was sad. Good plot, the multiple gunfights in the square were a little unrealistic, but that's movies, isn't it?"
5,great book,"i loved this book! this was the first one in the series that i had read and it was a little hard to follow at times but not bad. after i read this and liked it so much i bought the other two and read them and they were excellent, too. i would recomend this to anyone who likes a good christian read. Great job Mrs. Stahl!"
4,Simply a good book,I used to collect comics when I was younger and got away from them once I hit a certain age but it is books like this that are bringing me back. A friend of mine shot me a link to a review when the book was coming out monthly and it intrigued me...I had to pick it up. This is a very unique book. The audience for it is the main stream...the non-comic reading audience. A comic made for a non-comic audience...you gotta love that. Great art and fun story...I really like this book.
3,Just average,"I thought this book was just so-so. If I could I would rate this a 2.5 (and not 3). I didn't find the main characters particularly likeable and thought there were too many cussings in the dialogue which I found to be very annoying.The vacation was supposed to get the two protagonists closer together but instead they end up sleeping with total strangers! Mind you, they didn't even feel guilty about it. Is that how relationships are now nowadays?My book is now up for sale, it's not worth keeping in my shelf."
2,Like a trainwreck.,"Wow, this movie was special. I don't know where to begin!I actually have a thing for these bad, Lifetime-type movies with crazy plots and overwrought acting. As long as the story can keep me interested, I'm good to go. It's a guilty pleasure. This movie delivered. I am still laughing to myself at the implausibility of every major plot point. I felt a little bit dirty when the movie was over.I'm only giving two stars because the quality of the production was really poor, the screenplay was overly long yet still managed to gloss over a bunch of major stuff, and I know that this type of movie is not most people's cup of tea. I'd hate to lead you astray."
2,not bad,"its great that it comes with 3 dvds, however, the footage is irrelevant for todays youth. It is very boring, and not very entertaining at all. it is set in the 50's and just out of date. It would be better to see more dvds on this topic that are modern and that teens can relate and understand better."
3,Disappointed,"I remember my excitement at seeing the cover of this cd. The only reason I bought it was for one song primarily. That was ""Someone to Watch Over Me"". Imagine yourself putting on the cd, expecting to hear the the same rendition as in the movie, and instead hearing a totally different version nowhere near half as good as the original. This is not the first time for me that the original version was something other than expected. So moral of the story,especially when buying movie soundtracks if the store lets you listen before you buy, do it."
4,Someone to Watch Over Me,"No, the same rendition of ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" as in the movie is not on the CD but if you're looking for that version check out the actress, Jean Louisa Kelly, who played ""Rowena"" in the movie. You can download the song at her official website: [local website] and scroll down to the bottom of the page."
2,This CD is a waste of your money,"This CD does not contain all the original music contained in the movie. Jean Louisa Kelly's performance of ""Someone to watch over you"" is why I bought the CD and as it turns out, it is performed by someone esle. Very Disappointing!!"
3,Disappointed,"I agree with the other reviewer who indicated that he was disappointed that the version of ""someone to watch over me"" was different that in the movie. I felt that was almost a signature song for the movie and Jean Louisa Kelly did and excellant job in the movie, so why change and put a lesser version in the soundtrack. I did find the Lennon version of ""Beautiful Boy"" a welcome substitution."
2,"Disappointing, Is this the movie soundtrack?","I expected Cole's song to be done as in the movie. The cuts are the various artists doing their studio cuts. Are these the same renditions of the movie??? Maybe I need to re-see the movie.The artists & recordings are well done, but I expected a soundtrack."
3,Commercialistic Substitutions,"I have to agree with the reviews above; the producers who put this CD together made a crucial mistake when they substituted commercial versions of the key-songs in this movie. The substitution of ""Beautiful Boy"" being the only exception. I was totally disappointed to find that the instrumental version of ""Visions of a Sunset"" had been removed. Stockman's version IS beautiful, but should not have replaced the original movie version. Compounding the disappointment, the beautifully sung version of ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" (by ""Roweena"") was replaced with a different, less emphatic version. If you want the original sounds that the MOVIE provided, you'll have to look elsewhere."
3,A stimulating but incomplete memento of a wonderful movie.,"All the tracks on this CD form a lovely string of memories from the movie. The selection, however, was quite incomplete; the running time of the CD is only 42 minutes, so there was lots of room left for more original material. The wistful perfomance of ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" in the movie was replaced by a performace by Julia Fordham; this was a mistake in my opinion."
2,Eh...,"I asked my uncle to buy this soundtrack for me several years ago. I never really listen to it. The one track I listen to is the ""American Symphony."" Didn't really need all the old rock songs. Not my cup of tea."
1,"Where is ""Stranger on the Shore""?","As others have mentioned, this is not the same sound track you heard in the movie. Some of the same songs, but recorded by different people than performed them in the movie, different mixes for the instrumentals than you heard in the movie, etc. Also, ""Stranger on the Shore"" is missing completely. I did purchase a copy of this CD, but consider it a waste of money, unfortunately. I hope this has taught a lesson...When people watch a movie that's heavily laden with music and is about a person who's in the music profession, and they rush out to buy the sound track, they want to buy the music they heard in the actual movie!"
3,Need description change,"I've always wanted this soundtrack, but the reason I purchased it was because i needed the song An American Symphony. I needed a song that was at least 6 minutes. In the description it said it was over 8 minutes. Upon receiving it, the song is only 3:14. I don't know if there is a longer version but I don't know how to find it."
2,Soundtrack?,"Ain't so. A soundtrack is a a recording from a movie, that simple. This is obviously not the soundtrack from the movie Mr. Holland's Opus. I would urge Amazon.com to pull this musical selection or have the producers correctly label this item."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting to hear the soundtrack songs sung by the same singers in the movie, but what I got were songs sung by other artists. Very disappointing. The girl that sang ""Someone to watch over me"" in the movie was terrific. Far better than the version on the CD."
1,Don't waste your money,"This set was a great disappointment to me. I expected it to be a sort of historic travelogue. When I was young I watched a show about historic places in the US and it was fascinating. I thought this might be similar. I'd been wanting to buy it for some time and was looking forward to watching it. But the few I watched were just a collection of newsreels from wayback, 1940's and around there, with the normal poor quality of that time. The newsreels were quite short and nothing to do with each other so there was not even any continuity. I often couldn't see the connection between the newsreel and the title of the DVD. Also, one DVD for San Francisco actually had a DVD of Las Vegas in it, which I wasn't interetsed in. I plan to visit SF and NY next year and was hoping it would give me some background. No such luck. I don't know if I'll ever watch them all. The set is very expensive for what it is. Such a waste of money."
5,Head and shoulders above the rest...no comparison,"I've tried many of the most popular energy drinks but I eventually stopped drinking them because of the ""after effects"" (excessive nervousness, feelings of agitation, etc.). Syzmo does not seem to have these effects. It simply boosts energy without the ""baggage"" of the other drinks. Taste is always subjective, but I like the flavor better than the other drinks as well...it doesn't have the artificial taste the other drinks seem to have."
4,"SLEEPER PRODUCT, MORE HEALTHFUL THAN THE REST","Came across this sports drink in a health food store. No, the makers do not endorse a sports team, does not have that transverse blue line on the can (which took that other company a full year to decide on).That being said, full disclosure of the ingredients show natural ingredients. Blue agave, a low glycemic sweetener taken from the same plant that is used to produce tequila, replaces refined sugar and aspartame. The color is derived from vegetables.The taste? Not any worse than the name brand, so the only question is which do you prefer to run through your bloodstream?The fact there are only eight reviews shows a clear need for this company to hire a branding expert."
1,Worst energy drink I've tried,"I purchased 2 cases of this stuff after reading an Amazon review; the price seemed okay, and I was intrigued by the organic aspect of the energy drink. However, I extremely regret ordering this stuff. This tastes the most like cough syrup out of any other energy drink I've tried, and it has a pretty bad aftertaste as well; amazing enough, Syzmo tastes worse than the Steven Seagal energy drink, which is horrible. This stuff doesn't even provide sufficient energy for anything; more exhausted than I did before drinking it. I drank both cases just because I bought them, but I'm not ordering more of this crap. If you want a better-tasting energy drink try Hooah. If you want more energy out of your energy drink try Red Bull, Amp, Rushh or many other energy drinks that are easily attainable at your neighborhood 7-11."
2,Ultimate Jade Flat Iron,I would not recommend this product just because it is to heavy and the cord on it is like a big extension cord and very long. It works fine but is hard to use.
4,Solid 4,This cd was surprisingly good! Decent song selection and sounds like it was a good show. And this was right before they bombarded the market with BS product. I personally enjoy this cd and think most people would. Especially if your a die-hard KISS fan in need of a new twist on some old songs.. The whole thing has a good-strong vibe to it.
5,THIS IS WHAT KISS IS!! IT HAS THE VIBE OF ALIVE! -UNPLUGGED,"Not since alive have, I feel , KISS come out with a decent live album.ALIVE 2? It's just songs played live ( or studio? who cares )it lacks feeling.ALIVE 3 Was not done with heart, there are some highlights and Eric Singer saves this album from total blandness.ALIVE 4- While much greater than alive 2 and 3, probably lacks luster from the drumming, face it Peter does not have the chops anymore...Unplugged is one of those things where if ace and peter did it would sound horrible, you need Kulick on acoustic, sure Ace is the best KISS axeman live, but for acoustic, Kulick is right!Eric Singer, by far probably too good a drummer for Kiss, he is exceptional and delivers the goods to old and new Kiss songs..."
3,MIXED EMOTIONS,"As an old fan I was sad to see KISS venturing into another totally commercial project along with the dreadful MTV. On the other side, I was surprised by the good playing in this live performance (I hope there are few overdubs made in studio in this album.... maybe I'm being naive....)."
3,Reunion,"This was the first part of the 90's reunion of the four original members of KISS. Ace Frehley and Peter Criss joins the band for the last four songs, including Beth and 2,000 Man. It's all on acoustic. Other highlights are Every Time I Look at You and A World Without Heroes."
2,Just not the same 'ole Kiss,"I've been a Kiss fan before most people knew who they where! Though they have crossed three decades now, they should have hung the hat up in the late '80's. Kiss is just not Kiss anymore, they are ridin' on a name. This album is a prime example of the tired sound that was lost a decade ago. Leave this one on the shelves kiddies and buy the earlier Kiss - when the music was raw and the band was fresh!!"
2,Too predictable...,"Ancient as they are, Kiss is still a band with great range. I'm not talking about the musical scale here, I'm talking about types of songs they are/were able to pull off well. The Unplugged franchise has always been known for not only being an acoustic showcase, but for inspiring musicians to play the 'acoustic' versions of songs that don't exactly lend themselves to a folksy, campfire genre- see the legendary performances by LL Cool J, Nirvana, and if you can find them, the amazing Stone Temple Pilots and Queensryche sets for great examples.Unfortunately, everything you expect to be on this album is. Too many ballads, too many songs that sound like ballads, and not enough experimentation. ""Beth"", ""2,000 Man"" and ""Domino"" almost break out of the mold, but the rest of the set ends up letting you down.All in all, good for a big time Kiss fan, bad for a casual fan looking for something more exciting than the overplayed acoustic version of ""Rock and Roll All Nite""."
2,BURNS OUT FAST...,"At first you got a good impression from this album, if you're a real KISS fan, like myself. You like the new versions, find they to be ""nice"". THen, you sudden realize how empty this initiative was, totally imersed in commercial interests together with MTV. All of a sudden, you realize that this was not a product deigned to please the fans or the deliver goo dmusic; it was just a last breath of air to earn some more money. Advertising Criss and Frehley back, when they only fature in three songs, was also a swindle. Very disappointing..."
1,Not a good alblum,"Kiss puts some of its worst songs on this alblum. When Kiss unplugs you can fully concentrate on the ridiculous lyrics they write. They must sell tickets for their showmanship, because their music sucks."
2,Amateur recipes,"I tried about 6 of the recipes in this book and they weren't as good as the pictures made them look. I spent alot of money on some real quality cuts of fish, only to be dissapointed with the end result. It's your call..."
4,Buy this CD.....,"This is a true find. Harley Allen sings beautifully with real feeling and these lovely songs, all of them, are gems. A Nashville songwriter, Allen should be better known for sure. My guess is that we know some of his songs that other, less talented, artists have recorded. Buy this CD."
2,harley allen another river,"this was a bad cd from a good writer and singer,harley has some good stuff but this is not one of them,maby some other folks will like this cd , i sure don't like it"
5,Plz buy it !!,I'm in love ... plz use it ... it will cool your pc ... also can cool you when you sleep ... is the most faster fan ..on 92mm ... i have 4 of then ... with fan controller !!
1,DXI-5686-2 not a good buy,I purchased this phone because it was on sale. I did not check the reviews and what a mistake. I cannot even walk into a different room without losing reception. When I lean the phone on my ear it hangs up on the person I am speaking with. I work out of my basement and need a decent range and this is not the phone. This is a perfect example of cheaper is not better. Don't buy this phone.
1,Terrible range,"This is a decent looking phone, can hold a charge well, and is easy to use. The terrible range makes is un-usable for me. I can even walk into the next room with out getting terrible static. If I go more that 20 feet from the base, I lose my call. I think it's going back...."
1,There are better phones out there,"We bought this phone primarily to use along with our Magicjack. We're not overwhelmed. The phone has a very short battery life. One of the phone holds a charge for less than an hour. We've debated whether to return the phone, because it really was inexpensive. In the end, we did return the phone. Although less than $30.00 it just wasn't worth having around. It was literally a piece of junk and we're not the type to hoard junk. We ended up going to Best Buy and paying over twice as much for a Phillips brand phone, but it was worth it in the end. Don't be tempted by the low price, it's still cheap junk."
1,Poor range and reception,"This phone has a very short range (not more than 25 feet before static become annoying). Static also appears when you're just moving around with the phone. I also think it's one of the ugliest gadgets I've ever seen but that's, of course, just a matter of taste. Don't buy."
2,Quality is a joke,"I recently ""upgraded"" from a 2.8 gig set to this 5.8 ghz set. I thought it would be less interference because of my wireless router which operates at 2.8gighz. Well these two phones are the worst wireless phones I've ever used. I've lost count how many times someone will call only to get my answering machine because my handset can't find the base! I can be 5 inches from the base and the handset still can't find it. It does this randomly...also everyone complains that they can't hear me very well or there is a lot of static. I never had these complains with my old phone.I don't think I'll ever buy uniden phones again."
1,"Not a capella, lots of intruments other than voice on this cd","listen to the examples carefully, this is not a cd of music with only human voice. Not what i expected. disappointing."
5,Get this for drinking time.,"Great B movie with lots of T&A and more shown. Watch it while drinking for mindless entertainment. Low budget means better movies in many cases and this is no exception. No high tech special effects or well rehearsed dialogue here. Recommend as long as you are not easily offended by adult themes. Do not let the kids watch. The title says it all, ""Cheerleader Ninjas""."
2,For what it is... its hilarious,"It seems that a person is taking this movie a little too seriously. This is not a ""titanic"" or a ""lord of the rings"". Its just a really bad movie that is so bad... its good. I have to say that I was laughing my butt off at almost every scene in this flick. The acting is horrible, but that is what makes it hilarious. Lots of cliches, nudity, really bad fight scenes, bad dialog, no effects, etc makes this movie hilarious to watch. Certainly not the worst film out there (watch some troma movies) I would recommend it if you want to get some buddies together, drink a few beers, and laugh yer arse off.Definately classic in my books. Definate."
4,"Appleshare IP - on track, on target","I had jumped in to help with a school's Mac/Appleshare/IP network and needed some immediate help and guidance beyond Apple's own documentation.Tom Dell's book provides a good subject background for those of us just getting our feet wet and moves right on through the material with full information for even the advanced user.Contains good examples, meaningful screen displays to take you through various setups and options. He also gives you enough information to help make decisions when there are multiple paths you may take with your Appleshare/IP setup. There are good references to additional books and materials. The CD included with the book also contains much useful information for related software, both shareware and commercial.With using this book as a guide, I found if I still had questions, it had helped me identify where I needed to go to answer them."
5,Review from Books That Heal Kids,I've had a lot of success with this book in the younger grades. It is a simple and concrete message. We can use our hands to help or hurt. It's a choice. How will you choose to use your hands? How will you choose to solve your problems? I often read I Call My Hand Gentle a few times throughout the school year. Kids need a lot of reinforcement from adults to choose a non-violent way to deal with problems. I love this activity a teacher did with her students. Go get this wonderful book for your shelf.
1,Very disappointing--Unrealistic situation--Stock characters.,"_Track of the Scorpion_ is a book I tried hard to like. I saved the book for a rainy day and came to it wanting to savor every word. Unfortunately, this is about as bad a book as I've read. The situations are very unrealistic, straight out of cliffhanger, pulp fiction. The characters never seem like real people, but more stock stereotypes. I kept wondering why I was reading it, but I determined to follow through to the very end. It never got any better. Definitely not recommended."
2,script for a bad B-movie,"It starts promising ! A very, very hot desert, a plane full of bulletholes to be uncovered, a sharp lady archeologist. But within twenty pages things start to shift the wrong way. The crooks stay vague shadows, obtaining names but no lives. The father of the heroine is taking useless pages babbling about an ancient indian tribe which might have cannibalised on each other. The characters stay very dull and never come to live. Even the climax is disappointing. It is a pity about a nice idea !"
2,Davis doesn't do homework on NM or archaeology,"I listened to the audio version of this book on a trip from Vail to Farmington. It was a good way to keep awake if only because I spent the time marveling at the major flaws in the authors setting. As a resident of the 4 corners, not far from Chaco Canyon and other cliff dwellings I can state for a fact that the temp rarely reaches 100 (let alone exceed it!). The area is not sand and desolation either. This story might have been more plausible if set on the white sands missile range much farther south."
2,"Good southwest descriptions, poor knowldge of the military.","On the bad side: Val Davis' first work surrounds itself with a military cover-up scenario. It's painfully obvious she has never served in the military nor does she have a working knowledge of military procedures. She has ""corporals"" answering phones on Air Force bases, a retired person going to the PX when he's on an Air Force base (it's a BX), and repeatedly writes of the ""military mentality"" for cover-ups being the norm. However, she did her homework in regard to the crew size of B-17s.On the good side: Her writing is crisp and to the point. Just the type of book you can read on a two hour airplane flight.Respectfully: Mark Fannin, Master Sergeant, United States Air Force"
4,lots of fun-intriguing,"What an interesting idea!-an archaeologist of ""recent history."" Aside from the basic plot of a mystery novel, I really appreciate the inclusion of ""local color""-in this case an archaeological dig in the wretched heat of a New Mexico summer searching for clues to mysterious Anasazi. As for the main plot, I found the bad guys to be really bad and sufficiently scary to keep me worried, and the heroine sufficiently human and heroic to keep me involved. I have to admit that I used a recent bout of coughing-following-a-virus as an excuse to keep me out of bed until 2 am on a work night just to finish this story in one sitting. Is is great literature? Not really, but it is a good read."
3,good start but drifted into silliness,"I enjoyed the first 1/2 of the book. Then it just got silier and sillier as she killed EVERYBODY off. It got more and more unbelievable, and finally, it just tanked."
4,Where It All Begins - Classic Allman Brothers,"The Allman Brothers Band have been one of my favourite bands ever since I picked up ""Greatest Hits - Live"", ""A Decade Of Greatest Hits"" and ""Live At The Fillmore East"". OK, while I may not be your ideal reviewer or critic, I must say that Where It All Begins just rocks. Tracks like All Night Train, Soulshine, Mean Woman Blues are classic sounding tunes. The music kind of grows on you after a few listens.If you wanted to buy 3 CD's but had money for just one, this should be the one."
2,These guys are so much better than this disc!,"Okay, I am a longtime Allman Brothers Band fan--I've been to many shows, have all their albums, and trade bootlegs like crazy. I was suprised to find, then, that the performances on this album are just pale and uninspiring.Aside from a GLARING bass error towards the end of Soulshine (which could easily have been overdubbed), the tempos are slow and the delivery is lethargic, with none of the sense of urgency that marks some of their other recorded output (and nothing compared to alive show). It's not a ""studio vs. live"" thing--listen to the incredible studio tracks like Blue Sky or recent stuff off of Hittin the Note--it just sounds thin and formulaic.The songs themselves are excellent--it's just that this CD sounds like a recording of pre-tour rehearsal. If you want a solid version of these tunes, buy An Evening With the Allman Brothers--2nd Set. This one has the heat that Where it All Begins lacks."
5,Vivid and entertaining...even for non-soccerheads,"Funny, realistic, intelligent and beautifully written. I'm a ""draftee"" soccerhead, thanks to my son. Thanks to Jim Haner, I have an understanding of what this game is about. More importantly, I gain from him the understanding of what the game looks like from the inside. Jim writes about soccer kids with the same passion other writers save for major league athletes, and makes those kids live in your imagination. His description of individual soccer games alone is worth the price of admission, but his study of the game's history and analysis of the strategy (more Sun Tzu, less Clausewitz) has added immeasurably to my understanding of what happens on the field. I should add that Jim Haner has been my son's soccer trainer, and he's as dynamic and alive on the field as he is on the printed page. A wonderful read."
5,"Reliable, Multi-use Microphone","I have owned several of these over the years for both live and studio use. I have used them for drums, Leslie speaker, bass as well as vocal. I used it for vocals, as I get more punchy on my vocals when I sing seated at the piano than when standing and I've never been able to over-drive this mic. They have been dropped, exposed to the elements, and had many road miles on them. Never failed once. Excellent freq response. A huge bang for the buck."
5,completely happy,"I heard this was a good mic although I never used one before. Its been 2 years since I ordered them and all 4 that I ordered are still in working order and do the job for me. Priced right, compared to local stores, also. I would recommend this product and the company I orderd it from to everyone. Came with a nice zippered pouch and mic holder and SHURE stickers. If I need more mics I am coming back here!"
5,A Workhorse - Probably the Most Versatile Microphone Around,"You can't beat this affordable mic. It's not the best sounding mic on the market for vocals, but it works on all types of musical instruments, such as amps, drums, horns, etc. And most importantly, it can take a lot of punishment on the road or the stage from dampness or being accidentally dropped."
3,not a good mic for podcasting and book reading,"I think this microphone is more suited for drums and electric guitars, and maybe singing. I needed a microphone for more quiet book reading (like making an audio cd) and podcasting."
1,Don't buy from this seller!,"Do not buy from this seller, I bought a mic. and never received, I sent an e-mail and they said he was waiting for UPS for an answer where was the mic, I've had to write to know my purchase! Do not waste your money because you do not receive your product. This mic is one of the best, buy in a store but not here on Amazon."
5,"Great Mic, Use it For Everything","This mic is awesome. I use two of these on a regular basis to record everything. Piano, drums, guitar, vocals, bass, trumpet, vibes, marimba, etc. Here's a link to some recordings done with only SM57s:[...]And here's a bigger review on squidoo:[...]"
5,Glad i bought it,"This surely is a solid product, the build quality is very good, excapt the loose rotating head which i thought its broken hehe, i loved the leather case and the mic holder, i LOVED how my distorted guitar sounded in the recording, glad i chosed shure sm57!"
4,good of course,"What else is there to say other than legendary? It is sturdy, but does not get as good of a sound as I expected. Maybe, it was too hyped up by everyone. I often use it for vocals during practice. When it comes to recording, I found my MXL condenser sounds warmer and more full."
2,Can't Get Into It,"This is the first time i've ever heard Rick James, and I really don't like it as there are only a couple songs that I can get into. I assume that this is a Rick James Greatest Hits but theres nothing great about it.My only favorite songs are Give It To Me Baby, Superfreak, and U Bring The Freak Out.Thank God this isn't my cd, as I could've wasted $15.00"
5,More Than I Expected,"It took me about three weeks to get through all of the films here and there are some I want to go back and watch again. The reason is that each of the movies (there have to be at least 40) tell you the history of World War Two from a differnet perspective, so things I thought about during my first viewing will seem different after seeing other films. The film quality varies from film to film, but all of it is fairly well restored. The really good clips are outstandingly well preserved and even the others are all very watchable and you have to expect a little bit of grain with older films like this that were not meant to be preserved."
2,History of World War II.,"As a World War II buff, I was somewhat disappointed in this DVD set. I purchased the set based on other reviewers. As stated by others these DVDs are government recorded ""movies"". The DVDs are not intended to give a historical view on WWII but rather the govt. view on various topics. Examples include: ""How to wash and remove war gas; How a portable radio was constructed; Interment of Japanese-Americans and how they lived their lives there. The quality varied greatly but were satisfactory. The DVDs themselves look a little homemade but again satisfactory. I must state that I have not seen all of the DVDs and not sure if I will. I think that the set is too pricey for what you get."
5,A keeper,"I bought this in 95 and still play it regularly, (and I have thousands of tunes at home to chose from!) this blend of blues and ambient is absolutely brilliant, with bass that will knock you over. I don't know anyone who I have played this CD for who didn't fall for it immediately. Obviously put together by people who both know their music and love what they are doing."
4,Great Sounding Album!,"I first heard a track from this album featured on WTMD Towson-Baltimore a few years ago. The DJ said it was ""Little Axe, from The Wolf That House Built"", and that IF you were lucky enough to find it, you should get it if you like the sound. The cover of the disc describes it as the world's first ""Ambient Dub Blues"" project. Certainly more blues-y than any other other element, but if you're a fan of Mississippi or Louisiana-style blues music- go for it. It's very well-done."
5,The original Dr is so different from the newer ones!,For being in the sixties these are great quality. I became a Whovian from the new series so to be able to go back to te very beginning and watch the original episodes is awesome! I'll be buying the rest! Eventually lol.
5,The beginning of a legend,"It's a little bit hokey, but hey for the time it was made it was great TV. Old-school sci fi that took the whole space travel theme and turned it on its head to include time travel... all without a real ""space ship"" since the TARDIS goes places instantly. If you're a fan of the other Doctor Who episodes that aired prior to 1990, you should watch this so you can see how it all began. This Doctor is a bit cranky and crotchety compared to the others and is not yet enamored with the human race, so it's an interesting contrast to some of the later Doctor reincarnations who thought of Earth as a second home."
3,Early Doctor Who,"Doctor Who, Torchwood, Sarah Jane Smith, the Daleks, et.al. have become my favorite weekend fare. In the interests of finding out where it all started I purchased a DVD set of the first Doctor Who stories. I was not disappointed. What has always fascinated me about the Doctor Who series is that all the stories are interrelated and each episode has at least one tidbit that serves to knit the tales together. The question of why the Tardis always looks like a police call box is neatly answered in the original Doctor Who. I love it!"
5,It's about time!,"The announcement of this set could be a very good sign for Doctor Who lovers. Finally, a reasonably priced set of three complete stories in one package has been packaged by the BBC. For some reason, the BBC seems to have thought Doctor Who fans in the USA have very deep pockets as previous releases have been extremely stingy and grossly overpriced!Isn't it odd that a program about a Time Lord should have addition appeal due to the age of the television program? The sets are primitive as are the proto-special effects, but this is the charm of all Doctor Who's that pre-date ILM's ""Star Wars"" beauty. Seeing these older Doctor Who programs again is indeed peering back in time. Who would have guessed it would be like this back in 1963?I look forward to this and future releases of our dear Time Lord: Doctor Who!"
5,necessary,This product is a necessity for Dr. Who fan if you love the show itself then you have to get this it has the first 3 shows in it and they were wonderful to watch. The delivery was quick and efficient and I want to thank them for the lovely time I had watching and enjoying it.
5,The Birth of a Legend,"The Beginning Collection of Doctor Who is the series of video episodes that started it all, and what a start! William Hartnel is so wonderfully grouchy as the Doctor, and Susan is so sweet! Plus, the invention of the Doctor's most enduring villains, the Daleks, is a stroke of pute genius (even if they are scientifically and tactically improbable).Though these episodes are many, many years old, and the sets and f/x cheap, the shows hold up as ""stories"", and there is depth and heart in every relationship. For anyone watching the newer episodes, you should really grab this set and understand where the whole thing came from. It is necessary."
3,Not all there,"I was getting ready to buy this, then i looked up the episode guide. There are suposed to be 30 episodes in all for the first doctor. Not 4!!!!!!!!!! It should be around 15 hours with each episode being about 30 minutes. When someone gets smart and finally starts to put all episodes/seasons of the old ones in 1 package each, ONLY then will i buy them!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,the begining,first 3 doctor who stories whats not to love and even the pilot episode awsome it features an unearthly child the daleks(1st dalek storie) and finally the edge of destruction personally i think the daleks is the best storie in this saet but there all good all b&w 1963 1st dr william hartnell go on buy it its worth it.
4,Pretty good for 1963,"I really liked this boxset, only issue have with it, is that the unedited first episode should have been done as a special feature. Other than that, it's really good."
4,Mandrill Much More Than Funk,"It is interesting to listen how this band effortlessly includes various styles of genres and music into their compositions.It seems to me the relationship between the Wilson brothers compounded with their multi-cultural background enables this group to exercise an incredible amount of freedom in executing ideas enhanced with tasteful musicianship.It all adds up to great performances of their songs.The only reason I rated this compilation with just four stars is the absence of the song ""SOLID"". An unfortunate oversite that could and should be corrected as this is considered a cruising classic in East L.A."
3,"not bad, not great","These will get the job done, but I had to do some sewing to secure the corner on one of the velcro panels. You get what you pay for, and EFS products would have been my choice if they weren't on back order."
2,Used to be good...now cheaply made,"I bought a pair of these wraps from Dick's and loved them. They were built to last and worked well when doing bench press etc. Unfortunately, I lost them. I purchased the identical product from amazon and right away the product seemed very cheap. The elastic was weak and the thumb loop was of poor quality. The first time I used them, the velcro threads came undone when trying to remove. Amazon sent me a new pair, still cheap, and they second workout using them, the velcro came off again! AVOID BUYING them or else take them off very carefully."
4,Does the job,These are simple. They offer good support and seem to hold up pretty well. They are cheap too which doesn't hurt.
3,camp seat is okay,"This product is okay for what it is. The seat is about as comfortable as one would expect from such a contraption. Some of foam innards were coming out after leaning barcward in a effort to get comfortable. I was able to stuff them back inside the nylon shell. The quality is okay, shipping was fast and reliable."
5,Wrong-eyed as in impossible to represent,"Hallucinatory, mystical, melodic, dissonant. Terror, beauty and tears. This is a jubilant, sometimes hopelessly quirky hymn to life and death. Has there ever been a more original country-folk-punk musician? I bought it by accident, and then felt like I'd (fortunately) been let in to a whole blessed world. Sweet stuff."
5,This album is just plumb amazing.,"I could go on and tell you how Jim White's debut album sounds a little like this, or a cross between a pinch of that, and a dash of this, or how he sounds a lot like this feller over here. I'm not though, he is Jim White, and his sound is both unique and moving. Own this album, for your own good, on whatever level you appreciate the art of music, Wrong-Eyed Jesus will satisfy. He's a nice guy to boot, once, while waiting in the rain by the tour bus after an incredible show, he brought me a bottle of water and chatted some, how cool is that? Thanks man, for a great album. (and the water)"
3,Crash & Burn,"It's okay, but completely unnecessary if you have Robo part 1 and 2. All the other Robos after that is a waste of film."
2,Dead after 3 months,Giving this review now after having forgotten about this product but remembers as I go through my order history.Battery was dead after 3 months; what a waste.I gave 2-star instead of 1 because I'm not putting this (entirely) on the seller.Seller's packaging and delivery are quite good and on-time.Seller would be better off finding a reliable manufacturer for the product s/he sells.Sorry for the bad review; hope the content explains enough concisely that I don't mean you harm.
2,Political / religious book titles.....,"The book vault seems sturdy, but the books I received were ""White Protestant Nation"" and ""The Preacher and the President"". This item was intended to be a gift, and I really can't see the recipient displaying either of these on his bookshelf. Aside from the fact that visitors who are unfamiliar with the first title might think he has something offensive on his bookshelf, I was expecting something neutral that escapes notice - like a dictionary or a biography. I'm uncomfortable gifting something politically charged or with religious themes."
2,The book title,"Like others, I was bothered by the book title. I tried to exchange the item and received the same thing. I would suggest a more innocuous book(s) for future mailings."
4,Nice Item,"This item totally serves its purpose, the only thing I would reccomend is a different cover, it does kinda stick out in my library but it is also my library...."
3,Nice,Thought the storage space would be bigger. Setting that aside it is a nice spot to hide jewelry. Don't think it's big enough to hide a med sized gun.
2,Beware very small storage compartment,I ordered this double book safe beacuse I wanted something with a larger storage compartment.It came with a Storage Compartment that is no bigger than the one I bought before that is just a single book.So beware of this is you are expecting very much storage.
3,Misrepresented in picture,"The book covers on my vault are a book by Karl Rove (Unlikely to be a selction on my friends' book shelves!) and a baseball book, unlikely to be placed next to Rove. My friends I am giving these to would have preferred the 'Edith and Woodrow"" pictured."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"My son was so excited to find this submersible titanic model. Despite the cost we ordered it for his birthday. What came was a used paperback book - and no titanic model. Despite the text which says ""The Titanic Book and Submersible Model"" and the accompanying photo of the model, no model is actually included! So for $100, you are mailed a used paperback book. Unbelievable that this merchant is represented on Amazon. I returned the book the very same day and received a prompt refund, but no explanation and, as I continue to see, no correction to the listing. Horrible to watch your eight year old sob with disappointment on his birthday. What a rotten trick...."
3,Too Much Ginger Kathrens in Film,"The film is good, but like Marty Stauffer (sp?, the film maker cannot resist the urge to put herself in the film - repeatedly. I guess self promotion is how you get the next film made, but the truly great nature documentaries do not put the filmmakers in to the film."
4,great buy,"I bought the chaise and the matching sofa. The leather is heavy duty top to bottom. They were delivered FAST. I was a bit worried when I saw the box they were shipped in (very beaten up) but both items were protected well inside the boxes they shipped in - and came without a scatch. I only give 4 stars b/c the padding in the sofa doesn't seem to be very durable. I've only had them for a couple months and you can already see a depression where I tend to sit most often. I'm not a very heavy guy, so that's my only knock. For the price - u can't beat this combo."
3,"Not great, but OK","I can get Guarana at the grocery store that blows this stuff away. I didn't feel much at all when taking this stuff. It may have helped me to NOT fall asleep, but that's about it."
2,"I wouldn't say I hate it, but...","...this stuff simply doesn't work. I am hugely disappointed - I thought Solaray was a brand to be trusted. I even took 4(!!!) just to see if I would get ANY kind of caffeine jolt - and felt very little if anything! You'd think this would blow any GNC product out of the water, but noooooooo...."
5,By FAR Kylie's Best!,"I have never heard a song like this before, it is my NEW favorite song! The constant pulsating, thumping beat makes you feel like you are flying thru space at the speed of light. Kylie's vocals are strong, clear, and confident. She KNEW it was an amazing song when she recorded it, you can tell in her delivery. If working with the Scissor Sisters is what it takes to produce music like this then for God's sake Kylie create a whole album with them!!! Good work Kylie, We Believe In You!"
5,A home run!!!!,"In the same way she did with Cant Get You Out of my Head, she has hit a major homerun with I believe in you. When i listen to it i like to think its about God/Jesus. If this doesnt get to be a major hit in America, American music tastes are truly pathetic. There is only one recording artist in the world that creates true, unabashed pop music and that person is Kylie Minouge. Madonna doesnt even hold a candle to her. This song has the perfect melody and perfect beat. I cant get over how awesome this song is!!!!!"
3,Kylie Returns To Europop...Welcome!!!,"After the somewhat mixed results of Body Language, Kylie has returned to what she does best. ""I Believe In You"", cowritten with Jake Shears and Baddydaddy from Scissor Sisters, is all shimmery soft disco pop. At first, I wasn't too keen on this (too down-tempo perhaps). After a couple of days however, it grew on me. It's not on par with some of her previous singles, but it's a sweet song. The bonus track, B.P.M., is a nice contrast. It's the real dance number here, with plenty of beats to keep the Kylie crowd happy. All in all, Kylie has kicked off 2005 in good style."
2,loses something in translation,"Based on the plot summaries I'd read, I wasn't too interested in Hera Pheri, but then I read all these glowing reviews on here and decided to go for it. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't.I've been told that the humor is excellent... if you're from India, or more specifically, Mumbai. I guess the jokes are really, really specific. I didn't laugh once, and usually I can find the humor in anything.Not only was I disappointed by the film, but the subtitling suddenly disappears about halfway through and doesn't show up again until about 20 minutes later. Actually... I think I enjoyed the un-subtitled part the most because I made up my own dialog."
3,Not as deep as some of the other books in the series,"I have the Hebrews book of this same series and absolutely love it; however, the 1,2,3 John is not quite as in depth as the Hebrews. I was a little disappointed."
4,Very Good Lesson,"a very good lesson on the melodic minor. has taught me some nice ideas, although i am still far from being able to play jazz."
5,Great performance of a Great Opera,"The only qualifier here is that it is sung in English rather than the original Czech. Since Janacek's melodic line was closely related to the Czech language, this makes the English a bit strained. But that's the way it is with virtually all opera recordings-- you always wish there was just one little thing that was different. Personally the language thing doesn't bother me at all, but if you are hoping to be able to easily hear the actual words being sung, you might be disappointed. Not because anybody here ""failed"" in any sense of the term, but because that just isn't possible. But then again, that's why they give you a libretto booklet. And here, it is a pretty nice one."
3,Kinda hokey,This book is not a bad book. It is sort of wildly thought out and not really down to earth. I really like how the author encorporated solid gospel principles into it though. It's one of those books that you decide you aren't really fond of it but you cant put it down because its a bit intreguing. I would recomend this book to a younger teen.
5,Fighting Windmills,"This book was very much enjoyed by my wife and myself, the authors make reading Don Quixote so much more understandable, a brillant read , highly recommend buying this book for all young students with an interest in spanish literature.Made me read the original again, excellent, can.t recommend this book enough."
5,I loved it!,"Just finished reading Fighting Windmills and enjoyed so much learning about the life and times of Cervantes and his influence on the modern novel. It is an easy read for the literary novice, while at the same time, it provides many thought provoking ideas for literature buffs."
5,My daughter wanted crutches for Christmas!,Just as pictured though be forwarned it arrives in a clear packaging so it spoiled the Christmas surprise for us!
4,Interesting,"Think it is a good book, best if you have already the foundations of what Hypno is snd is not...has good technique ideas in it, personally do not feel it gives enough credit to homeostasise, but if one can over look that it is good."
5,Nice hard hat,I like this hard hat. I got it to use it with the ERB face shield attachement which fits right in the accesory slots.
5,great,"i bought this product, for my wife and one for my boss!they both loved it!the fit is better them my 80 dollar hard hat."
4,"as described, but it sits too high.","had to carefully un wrap the straps one loop and poke a new hole to make it look normal. I'm 6'4"" so maybe that just complicated things."
3,She asked me why...,"...Why, I'm a hairy guy. I'm hairy noon and nighty-night-night.And so opens The Dickies, ""Second Coming"" album.This by the silliest cartoon style, somewhat punk group from CaliforNIA. And if you loved ""The Incredible Shrinking Dickies"", and ""Dawn of the Dickies"" from the decade previous, then you'll probably like this collection of silly songs. Really. ""Hair"" alone is worth the price (whatever that may be) of the CD. But instant classics (just like Kool-Aid and...) like ""I'm Stan"" keep the laughs a comin'...for a second time, I guess. You're not gonna play this thing over and over again probably. But there are enough memorable moments to throw your money at, especially with the addition of the ""Killer Klowns"" EP. Can you sing Eep-Op-Orp-Ah, Ah without a lyrics sheet? I thought cha could!"
3,Focused on Cisco Access Control Server product,"A features and configuration guide for Cisco ACS. In the initial chapters the book goes through AAA but more as a needed introduction to ACS than as a complete subject. In my opinion it would be great to have more information about AAA services like privilege command for local router database, sample of complex router and ASA optimazed configs, etc. I gave a 3 star because I found the book helpful for an ACS implementation+configuration, which is mainly what it covers. So just changing the title to something like ""Implementing Cisco AAA through Cisco ACS"" would make it a clearer choice for the ones interested in its contents."
3,"Ok for the key concepts, but not a 'bible' by any means.","As a senior level student implementing my final security design project using ACS, I purchased this book expecting it to be an indespensible resource. Honestly, I don't use it very much as the book really just skims all the main topics. It's good if you want to get a general idea of what ACS is capable of, but for daily use the ACS help files are alot better.ps. Why is there no mention of the fact that ACS allows you to use wildcards for Shared-Profile Components in this book?"
2,"Should have been a great book, but it missed","This book had marvelous potential, but the author somehow failed to produce. The basic story is one of a barbarian named Tagart, whose tribe is annihilated by a group of ""civilized"" farmers. In the background lurks a more advanced civilization known as the Flint Lords.The barbarian vs. society angle is well written (and rather gruesome), worthy of any Conan story. However, the author does not give the reader the feel of his unique setting. The story could be set in Neolithic Britain or Hyperboria, with no noticeable changes to the story."
3,Would read the sequel,"I do not have the time to write a full review and believe that my headline comment expresses my view of the book under review,"
4,Back in Time!,"Outstanding story of England in the Stone Age. Tagart (age 25) is the only survivor after his camp was attacked. (The people of his camp were hunters). In 5000 BC, people lived together according to their professions - i.e., hunters, growers and traders.A great story of Tagart's revenge. One man against a village but it doesn't stop there... It has an in depth descriptions of the flora and fauna in that period of time.The chase at the end by tracking dogs was superb!Highly recommended..."
4,Good All Around,"Worthwhile read once one gets used to the back and forth of the writing style, It was good enough for me to read another by the author."
4,"Vengeance, an old story set in prehistoric times","Our here's family, his whole tribe wiped out. He wants payback. And he is very creative and driven...This makes this book an enjoyable read."
4,"The Stone Arrow, by Richard Herley","This book was a good read. Maybe not exactly what I expected, but it was interesting, and the price was right."
3,Major Historical Error,"Ger good read, evoked images of what the conflicts may haven heed as Stonehenge was built. But corn was referred to at least 3 times in the first 30 pages. Did not one other reviewer notice this? Corn did not arrive from the Americas until the 15th century, let alone stone age Britain and that is far from obscure knowledge one should expect a historical fiction writer to know. It was difficult the rest if the book to believe or become immersed in the authors world with that huge error in the back of my mind."
5,Norman Brown: After The Storm,What can I say. I've never listened to a bad song created/played by Norman Brown. All of his music is good including this CD.
5,Better Late Than...,"I only just discovered this CD after buying and loving his album, ""Just Chillin'."" I love that CD and ""After the Storm"" is my newest love! I think the entire album is wonderful! But here are a few favorites: ""Take Me There,"" ""After The Storm,"" ""Lydian,"" & ""El Dulce Sol."" However, the classics such as ""For The Love Of You"" & ""Any Love"" are nice too. I think it just flows well like a smooth jazz album should. It's well worth every penny. It's nice to get your money's worth! Listen, see what you think!"
5,True genius!,"This is an increasingly rare type of musical release that contains not one bad track on the entire CD. While some songs are better developed than others, none of them will dissapoint the listener(s). There is also a variety and intensity to the material on this CD which is missing from much of the other weak, insomnia-curing music we have come to know as contemporary (the ""smooth"" description is still tough to take) jazz.I recommend ""Just Between Us"" and ""Better Days Ahead"" as well."
5,MARVELOUS,.......can't say it enough for all whom could not concentrate on the word - try this - it will keep your interest.
2,Repetitive,"I was sold by the online reviews and I must say that although it is different from other audio versions of the Bible that I found this set very repetitive, therefore I got very bored by the book of Luke, i.e. I heard them tell about how he fed the 5,000 people with 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish at least 3 times, along with other things, at first I thought that I was listening to the same cd, but after getting further along I realized that they were different cds. I plan on e-mailing Zondervan because this was irritating. The sound and quality are remarkable but I wouldn't recommend someone to buy it."
5,Outstanding,"These CDs are perfect for long drives or commuting. Easy to follow along, very imformative. The speakers have exceptional auditory skills. Reminds me of the many times my sisters and I sat quietly at my father's feet while he told us stories of the bible. Great family night event...excellent conversation piece."
4,Love Listening to the Word,"I love listening to the WORD as I go to work, and the many different voices are like the characters coming alive and telling the Bible story. Some of the characters are not as lively and do not capture the essence of the character and what's going on at that time (Bible days) or at the place where it is taking place, but the story is still beautiful."
4,Pretty good,"It's great to hear a dramatic reading of the New Testament. The background noises are distracting, but overall this is a good purchase. It's great listening material for commuters."
5,Awesome,This audio NT bible is great to listen to. The bible is brought to life through the wonderful acting everyone does. It was special because each person played their role throughout the entire NT. Worth every penny!
5,Outstanding Inspirational Experience!,A wonderful way to familiarize oneself with the Bible. Great actors and impressive special effects. Can play in the car on the way to work or school or while traveling. This project took some real dedication and coordination. Makes a great gift. Bought two sets; one for my mother. Highly recommend!
5,Fabulous!!!,"This is the absolute best bible audio cd out there. I can not wait for the old testament to be released. Its dramatic, theatrical, the audio quality is superb, the actors do a phenomenal job portraying the cast in such a way that you actually can close your eyes and be transported back in time just listening to it. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially those who are not very familiar with bible verses. Excellent learning tool and very entertaining..."
4,The Bible Experience:New Testament,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to this audio Bible. It is a very good, entertaining and spiritually nourishing way to get the Word of God into you."
4,Love Hearing the Word,"This CD set is wonderful. I love hearing the Word presented with such feeling and exuberance from familiar voices that I identify with. Passages I have read for years have ""come alive"" with the inflection that the readers give to the words on the pages. And, I must say, Blair's interpretation of the voice of Jesus rocks my socks. I love it."
2,Noisy!,"I will say upfront that I did not listen to the whole thing, but to an audio sample. However, in light of other reviewers having the same experience I did, I would hazard that my feelings about the sample would go with the rest of it: waaaaayyyyyy too noisy and distracting! I couldn't concentrate on the words because of all that was going on in the background, and they spoke so fast that it did not even feel like a dramatization even. I expect the background noises and music on ""Adventures in Odyssey"" but then they speak appropriately and dramatize it, not just reading the words.I don't see how this could be helpful for someone who wants to hear the Word of God. It is more distracting than anything.I encourage anyone considering this purchase to listen to a sample before buying it. There is one on Amazon at the moment but I don't know if it will still be there. I searched for ""the Bible experience"" in Books and it came up."
3,A quality bootleg,"Submachine are more of a local mainstay than a national act. Despite the packaging's assertion of 40 songs, they fail to mention they are including all the aside conversations. You do get 29 underground hardcore punk anthems from one of Pittsburgh's favorite rock acts. The show is shot at a little bar packed to the gills with fans and non-fans alike. The camera positioning makes it feel as if you are watching the show from the crowd. You're not getting a five-star presentation, but you are getting a quality bootleg"
5,A great text to have in your collection!,"This book gives a nice overview of the various fields of mathematics (no pun intended ;-)). Famous Russian authors have pooled their talents to come up with a book that summarizes the majority of the mathematics available the time. It's basically a dictionary for mathematicians! Covers topics from number theory, calculus, analysis, topology and even higher up subjects such as functional analysis and differential geometry. There are interesting theorems, and examples throughout."
3,Bang Your Head!,"I rate heavy metal bands by the extent they are able to motivate me in the weight room! THE BEST OF QUIET RIOT definitely accomplishes this, especially with its live recording of BANG YOUR HEAD! This song, when repeated over and over, makes any weight-lifting session a success! This band reminds me a lot of KISS, which is probably why I like them. In closing, the album is worth having, simply for the live recording of BANG YOUR HEAD, as well as for the studio recording of the same. Unfortunately, though, because I'm sick of CUM ON FEEL THE NOISE and didn't particularly care for BLACK CADILLAC, I am not prepared to give this album a full, five star rating."
3,Cum On Feel The Hits.,"Personally I really like Quiet Riot, but the fact that this collection is an official ""Greatest Hits"" is kind of sad. It's not much better than any of the budget collections. It's only 11 tracks, one of them is here twice, and it's missing a good five or more songs. Of course I'm glad to see ""Slick Black Cadillac"", ""Party All Night"", and the obvious choices, but overall this is just fair. I'd almost recommend the ""Metal Health"" album over this. In short though, it's still their best ""Best Of"", and for the most part will still make you ""Bang Your Head""."
5,Compilation,I was looking for the best greatest hits album by Quiet Riot I could find. No store in the area had any selection but this is the ultimate compilation album by this artist. It is a great buy.
3,You really needed to be in the Mark IV Supper Club (1973)!,"Sylvia Robinson put this group together in 1969 as the featured act for her newly formed Stang label. The group that consisted of Harry Ray, Al Goodman and Billy Brown went on to be on of the premiere singing groups of the 70's and 80's. Harry Ray died in 1992, but Al and Billy along with Wade Elliott and Kevin Owens keep that smooth soul sound going today. They appear all over the country, Africa and the Carribean."
2,Superficial examination of the lives of women in the middle ages,"This book does not really give you that much information about the lives of women in the middle ages. There are 55 pages of text with brief descriptions of what women were doing during this time period. However, the amount of text is so little that only a superficial explanation is possible. For example, the section on Art and Music is only two pages long and the section on Women's Rights in Mediaeval Law is only three pages long. The second half of the book is a collection of images, not all of which emphasize women. Some of them are of religious figures such as the Virgin Mary and there are a few of carved caskets.I did not learn a great deal from this book, there is very little that I consider factual substance. The images are helpful in depicting the role of women in mediaeval society, but most are inaccurate depictions of what life was really like back then."
5,One Of Her Strongest Albums!,"This is definitely one of my favorite Chely Wright albums.Every song on here is a real gem!!With a great traditional yet commercial 90's sound and her beautiful country voice,you simply can't go wrong with this.From her great uptempos like Heart Shaped World,Right In The Middle Of It and the extremely catchy Alligator Purse.But with Chely's voice she always shines the most on the ballads,like the beautiful Love That We Lost,The Love He Left Behind,The Other Woman and the great It's Not Too Late.I can't recommend this album enough.It's simply fantastic and definitely one of her best...."
1,Not quite Wright.,Buy used and as cheap as possibleIf you are a member of the Chely cult you may like this album.But for the rest of us who expect more you will be disappointed.Not Chely Wrights best work.
5,A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY SERIOUS MUSIC COLLECTION,"This was the one Stanley Clarke CD that I was waiting for.It delivered BIGTIME! I only wished that I Wanna Play For You would have been represented by the studio version, and that either 'East River Drive', or 'Slow Dance' would also have been included.But you really cant go wrong with this collection.Most of Stanley's most popular work is represented here, as well as two new songs, of which one, the mezmerizing 'Lost In A Thought' has to rank among Stanley's best ever.Words cannot describe the excitement that this man brings to a stage, whether he is by himself, or in one of his many collaborative groups, chief among them the Clarke Duke Project. I recommend this CD highly!!!"
2,Should be better,"Fluke equipment is usually pretty good, but the 61 is not one of them. The backlighting for the display is uneven and can be hard to read. The viewing angle for the display is not that wide, it fades out when viewed at more than 45 degrees off axis. The display does not have good contrast. The display bezel is positioned in such a way that it's easily scratched. To switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you have to remove the protective cover (which is difficult), open the battery compartment and flip a very tiny switch. That's a poor design. A ""spot size @ distance"" chart is engraved on the unit, but it's hard to read and once again, you have to remove the protective cover to see it. The lanyard attachment is also blocked by the protective cover! For usability, it's better to keep the cover off, but then the unit is not well protected. Fluke stuff is overpriced, but the 61 is unreasonable. $20 would be a fair price for the 61."
2,If you've seen the movie you have read the book.,"Basically the movie in book form. It fills in one or two holes, mainly, who's the father of Angela's baby. Also the Vietnam portion contains a couple of bits not in the movie.This is a book based on the screenplay not the other way around so, if you've seen the movie, don't waste your money on the book."
5,My favorite Serge Gainsbourg compilation album,"This CD showcases the best of Serge, in my opinion.Somehow I think that Serge loved this period best. I think that this is where his heart was - long before he turned into Gainsbarre and the late 60s - 80s.The song ""Couleur Cafe"" itself is an enduring classic of French popular music. To this day one can still hear it being played on the radio in France."
2,Classe Gainsbourg,"Voila notre Gainsbourg national sur Amazon Ca lui ferait plaisir à Serge de savoir que des millions de petits gars de toute la planete peuvent desormais ecouter on-line ses chansons ce disque m'a fait decouvrir des titres inconnus a mes oreilles a ce jour , et pourtant j'en connais un rayon sur GAINSBOURG !"
1,Not good,"I love the Harbinger products, been using Harbinger gloves for years, the belts are great. However, these hooks are no good. Threw them away after a couple of uses. I all fairness, I've tried other lifting hooks, and none help me with the heavy weights."
3,LIFTING HOOK FUNCTIONALITY,"Harbinger is probably the best brand for training gear. I dont feel to comfortable wearing the hooks, cause if wear training gloves as well, its totally uncomfortable. You must wear them with your bare hands. In general aspects I ll say, the hooks are OK."
3,Well-made lifting hooks. But straps work better.,"These lifting hooks are well made and reasonably priced. But the trouble with lifting hooks is that they often don't fit a bar or a machine grip completely enough to provide the desired hand-grip relief. After a lot of experimenting, I've conclude that (less expensive) lifting straps work much better, provide they are properly adjusted and wrapped."
2,Hook shape doesn't hold the bar well,"I've used these for about a year. I use them for lat pulldowns because I have a weak grip.They are better than nothing, but not that great. The reason they aren't that great is that the hook is a very shallow J shape - more like a cross between an L shape and a J shape. Therefore, when I use them, I'm always scared that the bar is going to slip off the hook. During my last work out the bar actually *did* slip off the hook, causing the weights to unceremoniously crash to the ground.Thus, I don't have confidence when pulling and I can't pull to failure because the bar keeps sliding off the hook.Also, the cloth covering the hook has torn off, exposing the metal hook.I'm going to try Versa Gripps Classic Series Weight Lifting Grips. We'll see how those work."
1,Wrothless,"These things are only good if you're trying to hold something that's just a little too heavy for you. The hooks slip off if you attempt to put real wieght on them. I shrug 540 lbs and wanted something easier than straps, but these simply won't cut it. The design is bad... Plus they simply don't work for many excercises like inverted lat pull downs... I ended up just giving them away after the first night I tried them... terrible"
3,Needs some re-design,"This is good for doing deadlifts but not for chin ups as it doesn't feel right on the wrist, it takes some weight off the fingers but not a piece of cake."
3,only ok for me,"I purchased hooks for helping to hold more weight than my arthritic hands could handle. These are good hooks for my wife, but my daughter and I prefer dual metal hooks. Definitely my least favorite of the three sets I've used."
3,They're ok.,"The hooks aren't solidly connected to the wrists. I don't like that about this set of hooks, but they work."
5,Works as expected...,"Overall, I'm happy with this item. There are only a few moments where it doesn't quite fit up to the bar/handle but, I'd gladly recommend them."
3,a spotty debut,"As a Culture Club fan from the very begining, it pains me to admit this album has not aged well at all. The singles are great, of course. ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"" is one of the greatest singles of all time, an undeniable classic, as is ""Time ( Clock of the Heart)"". There might be one or two more songs here that hold up to repeated listening, but that's about it. The remainder are either underdeveloped or just plain bad. So: You've got your three hit singles ( the third being ""I'll Tumble 4 Ya"", which is only SLIGHTLY less annoying than ""Karma Chameleon"")all available on any greatest hits collection. You've got ""White Boys Can't Control It"" which is kinda cool, with its Spaghetti Western guitar riffs, horns and harmonica. And you've got your lurid purple album cover. That just about sums up Kissing to Be Clever."
3,Where's the TIME?!,I agree with 'wdallan's comments about the CD missing TIME! What was the record company thinking?! Wasn't TIME a hit or am I just losing it...
3,"Time won't give me time, and neither will Amazon","Time (Clock of the Heart) is missing from this album. I don't understand why.Also - the songs are not in original album order:Do You Really Want to Hurt MeI'm Afraid of MeYou Know I'm Not CrazyI'll Tumble 4 YaLove TwistTime (Clock of the Heart)White BoyBoy, BoyWhite Boys Can't Control ItTake Control"
1,Rip-off alert !,"I won't even bother making a detailed review of this release, for the very simple reason that this is a RIP-OFF. As a matter of fact, this edition of Culture Club's debut shamelessly misses the band's best song ever, ""Time (Clock of the heart)"". The song was a top ten single in many countries and is one of the band's signature songs, and it WAS on ""Kissing to be clever"" when it was released in the early 80's. For this reason alone (and also because of the puzzling colour reworking of the cover), you should avoid this release AT ALL COSTS and select the remastered edition. This isn't the real deal."
1,Amazon Rip Off,"Amazon is messing with this EXCELLENT LP! The MP3 version does not include the album versions of ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"" or ""White Boy."" PLUS, and most importantly, ""TIME (Clock of the Heart)"" is not on here!!! Try again Amazon! And it wouldn't kill you to add the B-sides from the singles for sale while you're at it."
5,Great album,"Politics, Religion and Her is one of the most touching songs I've ever heard. It's beautiful ! Meant to be is also great. All around a great album to listen to."
3,the woman an the vegetable,"this song is so true onions make you cry and so do the woman, no offense but it is true i recomend this album as well as almost all of sammys music"
2,Too many rails,"If you love rails...get it. If you think they're repetitive and boring and prefer snowboarding that occurs on a mountain, this may not be for you."
3,Very good but dated,"Very good films about turtles and crocs. Only available on DVD, dated but if you are a die hard fan of these critters, you will enjoy it. Kind of a disturbing bit about a turtle that romps around the grounds of his keeper with a sign drilled onto its shell, isn't that kind of gross?"
5,La puerta a un mundo maravilloso.,"Compré este disco por algunos artículos que había leído sobre SG. Realmente jamás imaginé el exquisito nivel de este album. Gainsbourg era un artista genial y muchos temas de este disco suenan como si hubieran sido grabados ayer. Recomiendo empezar por aquí si se quiere conocer el mundo de Gainsbourg, no se van a arrepentir"
5,Sounds like it was recorded today,"Today I played G Love & Special Sauce. Then I put this album on. It sounded like a French swingy version of the same ... stark drums, rap lyrics, but swing instead of blues. So many bands today sound like they've learned from him or even used his tracks? -- Radiohead, Portishead and Garbage, to name a few. The best way I can describe it is to call it 1960's French-pop-grunge. Some call Gainsbourg the ""French Bob Dylan"" but his music is far too innovative and eclectic to be limited by that. And his lyrics are not as brilliant as Dylan's -- though they are clever and sarcastic. The music is really what I listen to him for -- hip rhythms, swingy melodies."
3,"Brilliant in spots, good for something different","When Gainsbourg was 'on' he could be very good; he could also produce the kind of terrible recorded pap that makes struggling new bands wonder how he kept employed. This CD spares much of the agonizing misses and gives us a generous hand of surprising hits that mythologized a true pop-icon.Anyway, if Serge is forever a talented hack, a visionary who can't sing and coasted along on playboy faux-cool, well it is his ultimate triumph that he pulled it off. Chutzpah, the mother.I like the strange little guy. He was a perv and a freak but he represented a certain breezy raison d'etre, and nailed various hot ladies eventually to co-produce Charlotte, a daughter as lovely and charming as... such a man could hope for.COMIC STRIP is the one Gainsbourg you'll ever need - fun and silly and so very French. Good to confound houseguests who won't know it that well but will asume it must be hip."
3,"Interesting, but not great","I wanted to like this book more than I actually did. The story shifts between very different stories, that all eventually get connected. The art style changes as the story shifts. I felt lost in the beginning, but it does all tie together. It's got a lot of interesting elements: a cool, legendary sword; Celtic myth; Arthurian legend; a young boy questioning his life at a Japanese monastery; aliens and robots.In the end though, I wasn't a huge fan of the art (although I loved Poke) and the story didn't grab me."
4,Mystery with an aura of evil,"It starts off very much with the feel of a Marplesque village scenario or Midsomer Murder plot. However that feeling is just a trap to lure the reader into a deeper darker story. It has this aura of shimmering evil waiting round the corner. The characters are strong and some quite eccentric, which bodes well for further books. At times it seems a little drawn out and as erratic as a short S.King story. It may not appeal to the reader who wants a simple whodunnit, it is far to interwoven to be just a simple the butler did it, but it is def. the right cup of tea for the reader that enjoys a book with a pinch of something just a tad different."
3,Excellent suspenseful story; a little too disturbing for my taste,"This is a very well-written, effective story, and it kept me hooked until the end. An added bonus (for me) is that this is a real British novel, as opposed to an Americanized version (a la Harry Potter) of a British novel. Excellent for providing my anglophiliac fix.I chose The Wine of Angels because I had heard that it was suspenseful without being graphic, which is true. However, (tiny spoiler here) there is a fairly strong rape theme running throughout. While there is nothing explicit, if I had known about it I probably wouldn't have chosen this book.In summary, this book is close to perfect -- if you are not sensitive to a constant threat of sexual violence."
2,not what it could be,"While Mr. Rickman has wonderful descriptions of the old house and town and his characters are pretty intersting, the plot was weak in my opinion. The old legend of the apple orchard and the supernatural could have been played up more with more intriguing twists and events, instead of the mundane. I may read one more of his novels and then decide if he is an author i would pursue."
3,A Good Book but not his best,"This is a great way to be introduced to the Reverend Merrily Watkins and her daughter Jane. The story moves well and there are a lot of twist and turns, but there doesn't seem to be quite as much paranormal involvement as I've become familiar with in Rickman's other novels. I love his settings in old Welsh or English towns... even the minor characters prove to be interesting and integral to the plot. Mr. Rickman also is a wonderful source to finding out more about older Celtic legends, myths and monsters.I've been a fan of Phil Rickman's work since my sister turned me on to his books a few years ago (specifically DECEMBER, CURFEW and CANDLENIGHT). I love his lyrical style and attention to detail in those books. Unfortunately, he just didn't seem to have the same flow in this novel as he did in his others. I'm not saying that this isn't a good novel... its just not one of his better ones."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I have bogged down halfway through this book and don't plan to finish it. Mr. Rickman appears to be a dour, misogynistist who has no sympathy or affection for his characters. Mean-spirited, bitter and twisted!"
5,Chilling Mystery,"All I can say about this book is that it exceeded my expectations. This is both an excellent supernatural horror story and a first rate mystery. The characters are engagging; whether they are likable or not, they draw you in. Also, I was thoroughly frightened by this book. A claustrophobic, small town type of evil was present on every single page. The novel built up the suspense and tension rright up until the climax of the novel. Bravo!! I can't wait to buy the next one."
4,play it loud,"ah, man, it doesn't do any good to hold on to your expectations of a cover. let it go. this is a great album. so many people do garage wrong. they do it sloppy. There are some greats out there. Oblivians, yes, yes, we know. The Real Pills. The Makers in their earlier days. we all know that. This album is a rarity now - no one is putting out good garage. it's all glam and 80s revival. I wish the ettes would put in a bit more soul - I can feel that it's there, but they're not bringing it. that's my taste though. this is a great, play it loud in the car CD. it has great energy. the thing about covers, is you gotta let the new take it where they want to go with it. judge it on it's own. and looking at it that way, it's a good album. it's no 9 Long Years, but it's good."
3,"Interesting, but there's a better book than this","An easy read with some interesting ideas on soul mate marriages, Islam and life-exit options available before incarnating. I didn't think Thomas is ""The Great Communicator"" he is known as. I don't know why he has that title. Even one of his ""heavenly"" colleagues seems to agree about his deficiencies. A lot left unsaid and undetailed.I highly reccommend ""Testimony of Light"" by Helen Greaves. A far better read. [...]"
5,A GREAT BOOK TO READ AND LEARN FROM,I CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! IT IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL !!I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS BOOK. EVERY TIME I READ IT I GET SOMETHING NEW FROM IT. WHAT A GREAT GIFT TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE THAT NEED ANSWERS ON THE JOURNEY OF LIFE!
2,A frustratingly unstraightforward book.,"This is not a book I would recommend. Whilst the subject matter is very interesting the style of presentation of the material is not to my liking. As opposed to simply explaining how fractal image compression works, the author indulges in chapters of overly philosophic theory. There is a plethora of mathmatical and logical notation (which you are left to fend with for yourself). In its more pretentious moments it's almost comical, with the author becoming ridiculously poetic.This book really takes itself far too seriously. Less philosophy, less poetry, and more explanation of extremely generalised equations would make it much more readable."
3,Fun!,"I ordered this turtle for 2 reasons: one-to add to my collection of turtles, and two-to use in my kindergarten lesson about sea turtles because it's shell, although multicolored, has the long ridges of a leatherback. My 5 year old son saw it and immediately said ""this leatherback is colorful, mom!"" I was thrilled! The kids remember the slight differences between Florida's 3 sea turtle species! It's difficult to find visual aids that are are anatomically correct."
2,I'm so sorry but i did not like this one,"I was very disappointed in this movie. The charecter was not someone I could relate to. He had wierd hair and piercings. You don't really see people walking around like that in the Heights. The only good thing I could say is that the acting as pretty good but this movie was not my taste. I do give props to any Dominican out there doing there thing, I'm not trying to hate on you. But I have to say I didn't like the movie at all."
5,"Jan has written a clear, concise yet very complete book.","The book has great instruction at your fingertips to start learning the one-keyed flute. There is so much here! But it's not bogged down with copious trivia. This book is especially helpful for the Boehm flutist who wishes to transition into some baroque flute playing. When you purchase this volume, you'll have everything you need (apart from the instrument itself!) to get started, and also to avoid injury to your hands and fingers through incorrect position or over-practicing. Wonderful, sound advice clearly presented."
1,Not actually available.,"I ordered this a week ago, along with several other items. Apparently that entire order was held up by this thermometer. Then a couple of days ago I get this from Amazon:Due to a lack of availability from our suppliers, we will not be able to obtain the following item(s) from your order:""AquaQuik 7000 Derby Duck Thermometer""We've cancelled the item(s) and apologize for the inconvenience.So I'm not sure why this is listed as ""in stock"" still on Amazon. But don't bother with it."
3,"Rubber Duckie, falls apart unfortunately","Does it's job and looks cool doing it. We've only had it in the pool for about 2 months, but it is doing its job and appears solid.Update: After about 6 months, the thermometer no longer stays connected to the duckie :(Pros:- Nice look- Temperature gauge is accurate.Cons:- Falls apart"
2,Pool Thermometer,I returned other thermometers purchased at Wal-Mart because the temperature was very inaccurate only to find that these are also very innacurate. One if off by almost 2 degrees and the other is off by over 5 degrees. I have given up and will settle with these. I will just have to remember that they are off. They are cute and my kids like to chew on them.
1,Thought it would be cute,"I thought this would be a cute addition to our pool. It is off by ten degrees. Then when I went to return it through Amazon, you can't! Hazardous waste. It would have been nice to know that before I purchased. Only dissapointment with Amazon to date."
3,Derby Duck,"I have had a Derby Duck thermometer for 3 years and loved it. All my friends would comment on it. Over time the thermometer became cloudy and My Duck faded. I ordered 3 Derby Ducks from Amazon. Only because you can't find him in any pool equipment store. When they arrived I was disappointed with the quality. The Duck was fine, but the thermometer is hard to read and one of them was broken."
1,Temperature off by 130 degrees,"No, that's not a typo. After the first few weeks of use, the temperature started steadily creeping up, and never going back down. It's now past the 160 degree mark, even when placed directly in 30 degree snow. Not quite as accurate as I was hoping for. Pick another one, unless you just want to confuse your friends and family in the middle of January."
1,Do NOT buy this - Cannot be returned,"I purchased this thermometer and it arrived broken.It cannot be returned because it contains ""Hazardous"" materials.Better off purchasing at the local pool store."
5,I love this CD.,"There's nothing I can really say about it that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. I just wanted to add my 5-stars worth. This CD is pure goodness.Half of the Soviettes are Awesome Snakes. Check them out, too."
3,Space Machines (Visual Guides),"I recommed this book because it show detailed different""IN"" science and technology to my know.So this book isgood."
2,Pretentious and biased.,"I wouldn't bother with it if I wasn't addicted to stone circles. Get it from the library and use it for reference, but don't bother buying it. Not worth the $."
1,Destroyed my laptop,"This screen cleaner damaged my laptop screen, rendering the computer useless. It wasn't a cheap laptop, either."
5,Polymer Clay Bible,"Everyone starting out in polymer clay should have this book in their library. Many newer techniques have been developed since this book came out but this book contains everything you need in order to develop your own original work. If you're looking for a ""projects"" book skip this, but if you want the basics this is the book for you. I only wish Nan Roche would write another! I still find myself refering to it and I've been working in polymer clay for over 15 years."
5,still great,"As a newcomer to polymer clay I have borrowed 20 or more books in the last 2 months and bought another 5: 20 years on, this book is still one of the best in terms of comprehensive infomation on techniques. Some of the projects look dated of course as fashions have changed and techniques have evolved. Then again, the photos of Kathleen Dustin's work are a fascinating snapshot and, when compared with her work today, made me realize how far the medium can be taken. If you are more interested in step by step jewelry projects, Katherine Duncan Aimone's Art of Jewelry Polymer Clay is a challenging but great addition to your bookshelf (includes Jeffrey Lloyd Dever's pods, aaah!!). Lisa Pavelka's Complete Book of Polymer Clay is another comprehensive book, including the 'newer' techniques (transfers, Sutton slice etc). And yes, PC is very addictive, you have been warned..."
1,Sad retread,"It pains me to say this, but this is probably Benny Hill's worst effort. It is nothing more than remakes of sketches from the original show with New York backgrounds and unknown replacement actors. And no Hill's Angels. Stick to the original shows"
4,A Must-Read for Followers of Non-Profit Organizations,"As an attorney who serves on and counsels boards of non-profit institutions, I was espcially interested in this compelling tale of what amounts to a worst-case scenario. Princess Pauahi's last will left a trust corpus so large that it called for persons most experienced in management of investments. But for decades, the judge-appointed trustees (a decidedly amateurish lot) were insensitive to their awesome responsibility for providing high-level academic and cultural education to thousands of Hawaiian children, the beneficiaries under the last will of the Princess. This is a close account of the bumps and warts of trustees who have succumbed to temptation, from which we learn that trustees, regardless of the scale of assets under their administration, and regardless of the particular political system and the courts that have the duty to supervise them, need to be held to account regularly."
3,A biased perspective?,"Comparing ""Lost Generations"" by J. Arthur Rath and Roth & King's book on the Bishop Estate scandal, I was struck by the somewhat overly critical coverage of Attorney General Bronster's legal maneuvers by Roth & King. I don't think that Roth & King were able to achieve an unbiased journalistic approach to the subject matter because of their personal involvement. Although factually rich, I found ""Lost Generations"" a much better read."
1,ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"About ever year or so BMG decides that there just aren't enough ""best of"" compilations by Dolly Parton on the market and that what the world really, really, really needs is yet another one with ""9 to 5,"" ""Here You Come Again,"" ""Old Flames,"" ""Potential New Boyfriend"" and ""Two Doors Down"" on it. Here is this year's. If you haven't bought it yet don't worry, there are dozens of them like it out there and 2005 will, no doubt, bring us another one while literally hundreds of Parton songs sit in the BMG vaults gathering dust and many, many, many of her original albums remains out of print and have never even been released on CD a format that is over 20 years old. Such a shame to treat such a talent in such a contemptible way.Worthless."
5,Great music!,"I'm a Basia fan since her breakout hit ""Cruisin' for Bruisin'"" was released. I just enjoy her material and her performances. Very reminiscent of Brazil '66, etc."
5,Where is this woman's followup to this CD?,"I never tire of this. NEVER. ""The Sweetest Illusion"" is simply one of the great works of pop/jazz. The recording is exquisite, the songs consistently engaging and beautiful, the instrumentation is breathtaking. And the vocals? Well, yes, Basia is a fabulous singer. A note about the recording: When I am auditioning a new audio component or system, it is this CD I turn to. I know of no better example to cite for recording excellence. Where is the follow up to this CD? It's been seven years!Oh, one more thing. While I like her earlier releases, I'm not crazy about them. THIS is the one Basia CD to own, this is the one to begin with if you are curious about her music."
5,One of her best,"Drunk on Love is my favorite off this CD. I love hearing Basia now and again on the radio, although to see her live is enough to shake your bones. ""Yearning"" will never leave your soul once you've heard it live--check out ""Basia on Broadway"" for that incredible live version. She's incredible, packs a punch with that voice--like Duncan Sheik, big voice from a little body. Amazing, and she can really SING, too.Shame it didn't do as well as the rest though--she deserves better. This is a lady with pipes you will not forget."
5,A Work of Art.....,"Have you ever been moved by an album? This album was released around the time my father passed away. It really got me through that difficult time.In fact, when my sister gave birth to her first child the following year, she asked me to create a tape of music to take with her into the delivery room. It starts with ""Prayer of a happy housewife"" and ends with ""Yearning"" (the tape had other artists in between those songs). She told me later that ""houswife"" really made an impression.Yearning is one of my all time favorite songs it is simply perfect-music, lyrics and singing. Even the cd art is amazing. BUY THIS ALBUM! You will love it!"
4,Basia has another winner!,"If you liked any of Basia's previous albums, this CD is worth checking out. Listen to it straght through first and it will become enjoyable with every play. ""Drunk On Love"" is one of those true Basia tunes. There are a couple sub-par tracks, but overall, the CD is great!"
3,"Good, but not her best","""The Sweetest Illusion"" is my least favorite Basia album, although it's still pretty good. The problem I have with this work is what I perceive to be its lack of energy. As a fan of Basia since she sang as part of the latin influenced, early 80's pop group Matt Bianco, I am partial to her higher energy works heard on ""London Warsaw New York"" and ""Time & Tide"" (e.g., Copernicus, Freeze Thaw, Prime Time TV, Run For Cover). Basia's earlier solo works are logical progressions from her (and partner Danny White's) days with Matt Bianco. Fans of this album might say Basia is coming into her own here with these more personal songs, and I won't disagree. However, I prefer her earlier works and suggest obtaining a copy of the (now hard to find) Matt Bianco album ""Who's Side Are You On?"" for some early Basia vocals and great vocal harmonies."
2,POLAND CAN KEEP BASIA...,"Basia has an excellent singing voice, and this CD has good production values, if you like your music over dubbed and over produced. Unfortunately, Basia has failed to capture my heart, as I simply did not enjoy her music. It reminded me of nightclub lounge music, which has never been my cup of tea. There is not one track on this CD that I would listen to more than once. That is not to say that Basia is not talented. On the contrary, this woman from Poland can sing. It is just that the music she sings does absolutely nothing for me. Sorry, Basia."
3,A bit goody goody.,"I found this book in my brother's room and out of pure boredom decided to read some of it. I must say that this is not the kind of book most teenagers would actually pick up, buy, and read. This is the kind of book you must force your kid to read. Some of the things in it were Brady Bunch goody goody, and others just plain obvious or unstoppable (A.E. ""Things to avoid while someone is talking"" yawning or falling asleep...personally I think if you fall asleep when someone is talking it means that person is extremely boring or you are narcoleptic). I was not interested enough to finish the whole book, and the illustrations bothered me. I do not feel like Fred Hartley connected with me as the reader either. I give this book three stars, because some of the things in it might be worth reading. I would suggest you borrow it from the library though."
1,Freezes up on two DVD separate players,"I had read of others having problems with this DVD. It freezes up during Black Cat & The Raven which were the 2 moviesI wanted. Had it froze up during Black Friday only, I would have kept it. Hopefully I get a refund as there is no option for an exchange which I would have preferred. I have 50 movies already and none of them have ever froze up like this before.I have 2 DVD players Sony & Toshiba. Froze on both.EDIT: I have a 3rd DVD player that I tried it on and it worked perfectly.So I will keep it after all and just play it on that dvd player.Nowadays DVD players are almost the same price as a DVD movie so itdoesn't hurt to have a few extra players around."
5,"MUST HAVE/ Black Cat, horror/ Invisible Ray, sci-fi, UNIVERSAL Style",This is the one with the right films. THE BLACK CAT would likely still bother the censors and is a great remake of the OLD DARK HOUSE but more stylish and satanic than the studio hoped for and a wonderful film to see on Halloween or a full moon. There is also THE INVISIBLE RAY a SciFi'ish horror film with special effects that cut to today. The rest of the set is great and are others faves. I would pay 5 times the price for this set. It's not just Bela; it's great Universal Horror that I waited for.
2,"Mediocre transfers, ignoring KARLOFF, eschewing extras. Universal screws up again","Seems as though Universal never gets it. These are all great films. Some of the transfers are OK, some are grimy. The discs are DVD 18s which, when coming from Universal, otfen don't play well.There are no extras here, and there is a shocking lack of acknowledgment of Boris Karloff's first-billing in some of these films....It makes you wonder what Universal is thinking...Sad."
3,The Color Vanishes,"Considering the low price and number of films included on the discs, my expectations on DVD quality were modest. But I was surprised and disappointed that ""Scared to Death"" (Lugosi's only color film) was presented in black and white. I was not surprised that the brief color sequence in ""The Death Kiss"" was missing since the sequence has usually been cut in past videos (the color has been restored in the Roan version). However, ""Scared to Death"" has been readily available in color for many years on both video tape and DVD. Otherwise the films in this set are watchable although I'm doubtful about the company's claims of digital remastering. My own favorites are ""White Zombie"", ""The Human Monster"", and ""The Corpse Vanishes."" Lugosi has a field day in those three films as throughly evil characters without any redeeming qualities."
3,Missing scenes?,"I saw this movie again after having not seen it for several years. Maybe my memory is bad, but it seems like there were scenes deleted. One scene I thought I remembered is that Mr. Allison & Vitas (Bela Lugosi) were in a room where the walls moved, eventually crushing the people in it. Or maybe I'm confusing that with another movie."
3,a moden poe,several of these movies are just modern adaptations of edgar allen poe stories and my opinion is Vincent price versions were beter and true o the story lines.video quality and sound is good but not as good as the newer color stuff.
3,Decent,"Not a bad collection of some of the old Lugosi/Karloff films, especially The Black Cat, a classic. ""Murders..."" was a waste.--DJS"
3,Big fan!!,"I'm a big fan of old school movies and of Mr. Lugosi. Although this is a great collection, I knocked off a star because there are other collections of his movies that contain many more titles at a similar price. Still, its a good find."
4,Worthy Lugosi Collection,"As noted in another review, this collection contains two films, Invisible Ray and Black Friday, which really showcase Karloff more than Lugosi, but this is still a terrific collection for any Lugosi fan. He shines in Murders in the Rue Morgue, Black Cat and The Raven. The films have been nicely cleaned up for the DVD release and look good considering their age. The sound is decent as well. The set would have earned 5 stars but is lacking any special features other than trailers for a few of the films. Still, for the price, it's a great deal."
4,the decline of bela lugosi,"another review said it best,you can track bela's quick drop from leading man to side kick to his taking any job he could get.murders in the rue morgue is a a list production, not the best film but bela really hams it up and it is a fun movie.the black cat,the raven,and the invisible ray are the best of the bunch,all of them with boris karloff,who was able to get bela to step uo his game and bela is very good in them.black friday really is not much more than a camao and shows bela at the begining of his long slide down in hollywood.the transfers are good and if you like bela you will like this collection."
4,Vintage Horror With Bela and Boris,"""The Bela Lugosi Collection"" is ironically titled when you consider that the horror icon received top billing in only three Universal productions: ""Dracula"" (1931), ""The Phantom Creeps"" (a 1939 serial) and ""Night Monster"" (1942). As noted by other reviewers, this should have been a Karloff-Lugosi set. Nevertheless, it's great to find ""The Black Cat"" (1934), ""The Raven"" (1935) and ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936) on a single disc - thus compensating for the mediocrity of ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932) and ""Black Friday"" (1940). If Universal had given this DVD collection a little more thought, they could have replaced ""Black Friday"" (which squanders Bela in a minor supporting role) with the featurized version of ""The Phantom Creeps."""
5,A truly great movie and A dark comedy indeed,"I picked this movie out as I browsed the shelves at the local video store where I usually spend one hour each visit searching for a good film. Sadly, great films are hard to come by and usually now come from abroad. The movie's sequences range from somber to hilarious and for those who speak Spanish, the film is especially enjoyable. The acting is quite well done and the cast portrays the life of six unemployed friends for whom everyday is the same as the day before. The bar which they frequent is an excellent backdrop for the friendly bickering that goes on between the men. For those who seek a truly enthralling foregin film, ""Mondays in the Sun"" is a must and I certainly plan to buy the DVD and add this wonderful film to my collection."
3,Okay Movie About Unemployment,Being unemployeed is something many can sympathize with. This movie struggles to get off of the ground and I found my thoughts drifting away from the movie at the beginning. It is a dark comedy with moving and heart breaking moments.It's not what I expected.
3,The story of the losers,"I cannot say I liked this film. The thing is that actors are great, story is developed calmly but not too slowly. Some scenes are plenty of interesting ""messages"".For all of this, ""Mondays in the Sun"" is fantastic. What is the problem? The problem is the story itself. You can use best actors, best studios, best screenplay. But when the story is plain and gives you no new point of view of a well-known work conflict, you have the sensation you have been not a film, not even a documental, but an article in a TV magazine.This film has been overprized and overpraised here in Spain. We have terrible work conflicts, and some of them have to do with naval industry. I think this film is very superficial because it shows dismissed workers as losers but happy. And those who have earned a life and have raised from nothing are shown as naive and sad.And so this is not a good message for young people trying to earn for a life."
2,"Sterling acting, shallow story","The story is imbued with the European mindset that people are owed a job and a meaningful life by either businesses or the government. Those who accept that view sacrifice their responsibility, and therefore a chunk of their humanity. So, the characters in this film hobble along rather pathetically and childishly, waiting for someone to restart their lives. Bardem is a fine actor, and the others do well, but this is a slight film offering no useful insights. It stands in stark contrast to films by the great director, Zhang Yimou, whose characters inhabit far more difficult conditions, but who struggle mightily to overcome the odds and maintain their pride. As one of the characters hints when slandering Koreans, a Europe awash in the welfare state has much to fear from industrious workers from Asia and elsewhere."
5,social reality,"I saw this movie in Barcelona, Spain in May 2003. It is so realistic. It portraits the lives of those without a job in Spain, but it also can reflect social reality in any country. The characters in the film are mature men sharing the same preocupation ""el desempleo"". We see their ordeals applying for jobs, but they never get them. They are frustrated. It is very touchy and it made me think for days. I give it 5 stars. Teneis que verla!"
4,A reward only for patient cinema viewers,"How can one one be entertained by a movie about the unglorious lives of four laid off shipyard employees in the grim setting of an economically depressed Spanish coastal city? Certainly, the slow pace of bar room banter coupled with the latent rage of the characters do not make for gripping drama. Yet, for the patient viewer, this award-winning Spanish movie becomes cinema verite at its best. The many subtle shades of human emotion and motives in the lives of these characters as they precariously tread in unemployment, are rendered with an unhurried pace which matches the reality they face daily of no real exit from misfortune other than to console themselves with each other. The movie turns out to be a winner!"
2,watch the grass grow,"I felt this had a slow-moving plot. It took a long time to unwind and then had a rapid wrap-up. Suddenly everything was resolved and the film was over. I was very disappointed with that. I was never particularly interested in the storyline either. I did like the narrative from the girl's perspective and it was...sweet, but overall it was flat and clumsy. You can find many things better to watch than this. You will not have missed much by skipping this one."
3,not bad,"We got this for dog training rather than camping. The shipping was fast and the product was fine. They are a little brittle and one tube already broke but I'm not sure whether that is a function of the tube design or how we were using it. In all fairness, we were using it for dog training and keep it in the fridge while not being used so that might have had something to do with the cracking. Otherwise, these tubes are great for many different foods and uses. We'll probably get more for camping."
4,Refillable squeeze tubes.,"The squeeze tubes have performed well in the short time I've had them. Results on long term durability and performance remains to be seen but so far, so good!"
3,Just so-so,"I bought these for dog training and they work for that purpose ok. However, the lid pops off very easily, even if it is screwed on ""tight"" (note, it doesn't screw on very tight, if you try to tighten it, the threads give way and the top pops off). A dog handler friend had one of these in her pack and the lid popped off, causing the contents to end up all over the inside of her pack. I am a bit more careful with mine and make sure these are in a zip lock back before I put them inside anything. The upside is they are easily cleaned."
3,Can't completely recommend it,"Here are the positives: a very nice dvd, fine sets, a lovely libretto, very enjoyable orchestration, and very good singing for the most part. The tenor was slightly weak, but all the other singers were extremely good and enjoyable. What ruins it all for me, is the generally ugly, repetitive and dull vocal line. Don't get me wrong - there were some magical moments where it appeared Adams really took care with the vocal melody and it was very lovely but these moments were way too few and far between - it seemed for the most part he just quickly jotted down tons and tons of recitative as fast as he could. I found it very annoying, and I was longing for more great material for these terrific singers all through the show. If the vocal line were more polished, I would definitely have said Adams achieved a masterpiece, but the lack of it, when everything else was so lovely, left me very disappointed."
2,"Good, But not good enough.","I saw this production after Seeing the Met HD broadcast.First much of the music is very good, Finley is excellent, but not all.Secondly the Set and staging are reasonable but not overly compelling.And as others have said, the filming was not the best.Wait for the Met broadcast to come out, you won't regret it."
3,Sellars Did It Better,"After being very impressed with the Peter Sellars production of ""Doctor Atomic"" in Chicago, I was mildly disappointed with what Penny Woolcock did to it at the Met. I guess that interpretation was supposed to be postmodern or something but I found it unnescessarily static and stodgy by comparison. So my recommendation for a DVD would be the OPUS ARTE recording of the lively Sellars-directed production at the Het Muziektheater in Amsterdam."
5,A super souveneir,"My family and I recently visited Carlsbad Caverns. We entered through the natural entrance and toured the big room. I purchased this video at the gift shop on the way out. It shows the highlights of the cave in a way that I could not have filmed it myself. Also, the music tour, an extra on this dvd shows the bat flight from both inside the cave and outside the cave. Since no cameras or video recording devices are allowed at the bat flight program, this dvd is a true gem."
3,Sort of like a weeknight network movie,"Cute couple of guys, pretty well acted script, interesting enough story that you want to watch the movie. Overall, a nice little flick for a weeknight after work."
2,"Toss between ""like it"" and ""dislike it""","It's ages since I've been so torn in my rating.Plot in a few words - wealthy gay couple decides to adopt a baby. The waiting list is long, so social worker (Gloria) gives them a chance to become foster parents and leave two boys at their house.Nothing goes well from the very beginning and arrival of drunk mother of these two only worsen situation.But this is an american production. So, there must be a happy ending...And that is one of the reasons I lower my rating. The final part of this film is so sweet that I got tooth-ache:(Another reason why I am disappointed about the whole story is one particular scene - worth the biggest drama queen in the world. Throwing himself on the hood? With a fake gun in his hand? (so fake, that even kids wouldn't believe that it's a real weapon!). Screaming with pitch voice? Yep, it's our hero, local saviour - Phil. Too much for me.It put me off.If you plan to buy it, rent first."
1,shut up,this is a movie that if you are a whiney self involed queen will think is tacky ad if you like cheesy then watch it if not run away now not worht it
4,Dutchman of Christian Metal,"This influential Swedish band did a lot to pave the way for the countless Christian Metal bands that followed their trail. When I was a kid in Germany, a friend pointed this band out and dubbed this album for me. At the time, it really was different than what I was listening to. The message in the songs are a direct shameless declaration of their faith. Like a preacher on the soapbox in the town center, the are direct about their intention to wins souls to Christ. The music hard rockin' but also very Scandinavian. You'd have to be deaf not to detect elements of classical music. There is also a big emphasis on vocal melodies and haromonies. A good while back, I located a second hand vinyl of this album, and a 12 in single of ""I'm a believer"" released by Viva Records. I'm proud to say I have them in my collection, and I'm not selling."
5,1-inch hole saw,Decent quality for the price and it fits my existing mandrel.I used it to cut a piece of aluminum and it worked well.
1,Soular Reunion,This book offers too much speculation and a disappointing lack of scholarship. Not enough substance to make this endeavor worthwhile.
4,Twin Souls & Self Mastery,"This book will not appeal to the lonely heart crowd looking for a quick fix, but I liked the book very much because it tells the truth,meeting and recogizing your twin flame demands a certain level of spiritual maturity and inner work. Your twin soul will not come into your life to fix you or to be fixed. Getting through life first requires self mastery! This is hard work and may not appeal to the masses. Everyone is looking for a quick fix, your twin soul is not it and either is this book. This book offers a lot of truth and practical applications. For serious seekers only."
5,Soular Reunion Journey to the Beloved John & Diadra Price,This book was exactly what I was looking for. Anyone who reads this book was led to it by a higher power. This book answered so many questions and even raised a few more. I finally found a book to give me knowledge and enlighten me on this deep and intriguing subject. If you are at this level of asking you will appreciate this book. It is more of a question and answer and informational guide. It validates much of what I was confused about.
1,Soular Reunion,"I did not care for this book. Based on the title I thought it would cover how to recognize and find your soulmate but the authors tell you right away that that isn't going to happen and then the entire book is filled with mystical exercises that are supposed to ""prepare you for joining your soulmate"". I felt the cover was incredibly misleading and that the authors used a ""buzz word"" like ""soulmates"" to sell their book. This is a book that would appeal to mystics and people interested in esoterical themes but that isn't me. I am very disappointed in this book and feel it was a waste of my money."
5,An excellant extension to KarateDo Kyohan.,"This book not only shows you examples of how to correctly perform techniques, but also shows you examples of how techniques performed poorly can leave openings for your opponent. This is an excellant book for all levels of Shotokan Karateka."
5,Excellent book for students of Japanese karate,"I'm a relatively new karate student (yellow belt), and this is the first karate book I've read. It had exactly what I was looking for; information to help me fine tune the techniques I've been learning. The information on the back of the book says it includes ""the fundamentals plus the fine points"", and it really does, including pictures, written descriptions and Japanese karate vocabulary as well as general tips and information on the history of karate.The price is good,too. I did not buy it from Amazon, and I paid a discounted price of $25.20."
5,best karate book ever,very interesting and instructional. really like the picture diagrams of each kick and stance. have learned a lot from this book.
5,JKA textbook!,"THE book on Shotokan Karate as taught by the Japan Karate Association. Besides having hundreds of pictures and explanations of techniques, it is filled with numerous action pictures of the Masters of The Japan Karate Association from the 1950's and 1960's era.Simply put, a MUST have for all Shotokan Karate-ka!"
2,A Little Disappointing,"I'm still a Karate novice but most of what this book had to say sounded old. If you are taking Karate classes with a decent teacher, you can skip this book. Most of the advice will already be familiar to you. Save 30 bucks for a better book."
5,ben,this is a great box of cards my boy loves it all he wants to do is play with the cards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A must have for Trespasser,"This book is a must have if you want to go far in the game. It has detailed pictures and descriptions of every weapon, dino, and site on the island. Excellent book, but it should have come with the game. The dinkey little insert in the CD jewel case was NOT cool at all and not a great help. I agree with the previous reviewer, this book should've been with the game and all of us who have bought the game and then the book deserve a refund for the purchase price of the book. Good luck with the game!;)"
3,"The book is good, but it was made before the software?","When I purchased the software, it was hard to find my way around. I notice that a guide for the game was already made and for sale. I felt funny buying the book, just because some of the information should have been given from the beginning. It's like the company wanted to make the extra $19.99. I also felt that the book was made before the software. Like it was part of the instructions. I was not happy with the software information, and as far as I'm concern, this book should have came with the software. Maybe I can get a $19.99 off the $44.99 software price."
2,Very basic......,"This item is of limited value to all but the most novice of players. Even then it doesn't help that much. In example, it spends approx 10 seconds on the grip, showing the three different styles, but not how to actually grip the club. I had bought this to help friends get started with golf, but doubt it will be of any use. This is more of an overview of golf.On the positive side, it does have some very basic info on etiquette and rules, but again very limited. There are some tips that were helpful, in that they reminded me of what I already knew."
5,I couldn't live without this book!,"I think I have used almost every idea in this book. Not just for US History, but in other content areas as well. It is a really nice foldable resource. The kids love foldables."
1,FULL SCREEN in spite of product description,"Don't be fooled. Though the product description says 'widescreen,' both flicks on this disc are full screen. What a ripoff."
3,Not Really What I Was Looking For,I was in search of specific information regarding a certain type of killer for a research project. The book is great if you're looking for a wide variety of murder statistics involving women as the perpetrator. I felt there was a paucity of information on motives and offender characteristics (I have found much more on my own) which was the major reason I was told to buy the book. So I am overall disappointed but I can't blame the book because the book itself is good for what the author is relaying to the audience.
2,Rather dissapointed by the Colonels work on this book,"While the Colonel makes some good points in this book, he's also taken the basic facts and dumbed them down to the point where halfway through the book you will ask yourself ""Why did I buy this book?"" The answer will probably be close to ""Because Colonel Jeff Cooper wrote it and he's a gun expert"".Anyone who knows guns, who've been around them for 6 months or longer will already know 80% of the information in this book. The other 20% you can learn drinking coffee and eating doughnuts at your local gun shop.Save your money is my opinion and don't buy it."
2,Disappointing,This book contains some nice stories but it will not do much to improve your marksmanship. There is very little information on rifle sights or how to use them. Some shooting techniques were good but that is about all. This book should sell for about 4.95.
5,A Cooper gem,"Col. Cooper keeps it short, simple, and direct. As with his other books, no words are wasted or minced. This is a must have for anyone serious about rifle shooting at any level."
5,Tannenberg Clash of Empires,This is an excellent study of a momentous battle. Excellent research and very well written. This is an all-absorbing tale of one of the great battles of World War One from (primarily) the German side. Recommended!
3,Disappointed with picture quality of Telefon,I have been waiting for Telefon to be released on DVD for years and I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with the picture quality. I have found the image to be unusually soft in many places - mostly the interior scenes. There is a definite lack of sharpness. The movie itself is excellent.
2,Warner Brothers needs to try again!,"Come on Warner Brothers! Stop with these two-sided discs. Put each movie on a seperate single-sided disc! Charge an extra 5 dollars. We'll live with it. Especially, if you remaster Telefon. You really dropped the ball on this one."
5,Charles Bronson Collection,"Charles Bronson Collection. If your a Charles Bronson fan this is a MUST HAVE!!These are non stop action packed at it's finest as if they where done last week. As well as the others in these acting, this has to be Charles Bronson's top movies. One Warning! While your watching these movies,be careful when you answer the phone!"
4,Charles Bronson movies,"I always loved watching Charlie in the movies and I know he isn't with us now but I can view him all I want and never get tired.These are great movies,at least I think they are."
4,Underrated,"The song 'Catch the Wind' was used at the beginning of a Miami Vice episode during the first season, 1984-85. Kind of unusual in that everyone thinks of the show as using only contemporary pop songs to bolster its plot lines. This song is the band doing their very best to imitate Bob Dylan."
2,No time like the wrong time--and it's the wrong time to listen to this,"I recently downloaded a few Al Kooper tracks from Itunes and waxed sentimental for what I thought I remembered hearing back in 1967 when I saw The Blues Project live. Sorry, you can't go home again, especially if home is a band that had identity problems and poor production. The blues tracks are amateurish by any standard. Let me correct that: they are painful to listen to. The Steve Katz songs perhaps could be revived by an American Idol wannabe on his way down the schmaltz ladder. There are a few intresting tracks that survive. I only wish that this had been up on Itunes so I could have downloaded those @ 99 cents per until I realized that it was time to quit."
3,What does it take?,"A -lot- of people were surprised that these guys didn't make it. Walking around Old Town/Wells St/Chicago in the late sixties, if the 'hip' Juke boxes weren't playing Dylan/Butterfield/Bloomfield Stuff, they were pumping out some of Danny Kalb's hotter solos with TBP. So what went wrong? Well, contrary to what the insiders think, the average fan has a pretty good ear, and even if your favorite musician is in a particular band, the -singing- is really what its all about. The only band who beat the vocal requirement was the Grateful Dead, and Jerry's voice is like sunshine compared to this."
5,Blues Project is important in much of music that followed.,I really enjoyed the album and found it a springboard to much of the music I spent enjoying in the last 60's and 70's.
3,To much filler.,"This CD includes all the songs from their CD ""Projections"", which is a great CD. The rest seems like songs they just used to fill the rest out the CD with. I wish I had just bought the ""Projections"" CD."
3,"Great in their prime, not great before it","I remember The Blues Project when they gave free outdoor concerts in Washington Square Park in The Village. I was a huge Blues Project fan. They were New York City's hippie music, along with The Lovin' Spoonful. You might think of them as NY's answer to Jefferson Airplane and The Doors in Cali.Projections was one of my favorite albums. Wake Me Shake Me and I Can't Keep From Crying are, in retrospect 35 years later, just as great as I thought they were back then.I was disappointed in the earlier material on this box set. I can see why it didn't become popular. The whole first cd is pretty lame."
4,"Excellent straight ahead, intelligent rock","This is really a solid album. Whenever I listen to this album I feel like I am transported into some random Roadhouse in Texas where I happen to wander in and find that the house band is really killer. This music is meant to be listened to loud, but that doesn't mean it has nothing more than ""anthemness"" to offer. Think the Georgia Satallites but less with less twang and less harmonica. The guitars, while maybe a bit monotonous through out the album scream clear in every song and are matched by the vocals. songs range from the humor tinged ""Girlie"" to the sentimental ""Mekong."" An extremely solid effort."
5,Great Music and a sense of humor,This album is great. The music fits just about anyone and goes with almost any momnet.
5,Diamond in a haystack,"If only more people had known how great these guys were... Must've been bad marketing, 'cause this and even the 2nd to some degree are great. I have listened to this CD so much it must have laser rot. This is an awesome bar-rock, latin/country, hard-rock melding. Wonderful. Oh yeah, people, Roger and another guy or two are in a new band called Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers....one of the top 5 unsigned bands in the world. Buy their record, Honky-Tonk Union on this site because you can't find it anywhere else."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I bought this album when it first came out, and I still find myself listening to it at least weekly. If you like what you've heard of The Refreshments on the radio, then you will without a doubt love this album as much as I do. The music has such great rhythm and the lyrics are so witty - it's guaranteed to make you smile and dance no matter what your mood :) If you're even the slightest fan of rock this CD is for you. A must have for everyone's collection!"
5,Still phenomenal!,"I'm another one of those people who got this album back in the day when ""Banditos"" was on the radio (high school seems like so long ago!). There is a reason this album has flawless reviews and still an extremely high ranking for an older CD. The only music I listen to is country, yet this album always finds its way into the playlist. FFBB will not disappoint and I highly encourage you to give it a listen."
5,Great CD,This thing is great This is the secound CD I have had to get. If you like southwest style rock you will love this .
5,Great album,"This is a great album, it is the prelude to Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers. If you like Roger Clyne this is one of his best."
5,Over 15 years and still great,"There's something about this album that makes it timeless. I think for me, it's one of my favorite traveling albums. Full of songs about being away from home, running out of gas, and drinking. Favorites are Nada, Mekong, and Blue Collar Suicide. Be sure to listen to some Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers if you like the old Refreshments stuff (his newer band)."
5,One of the most underrated albums of the 90s,"This album sort of defines epic power pop as it (rarely) existed in the 90s. Every track here is a gem; the songs tell great stories, often with a wonderful blend of humor and pathos. The band is tight without being overly polished, and they rock solidly. It's a shame that the outfit only lasted for two albums. They deserved so much better given the crap that often makes it to the charts. From the rollicking, vitriolic opener ""Blue Collar Suicide"" to the poignant closing ""Nada,"" every track is memorable."
4,Soundtrack for a Roadtrip,"To me, this album stands out as having a classic ""American"" sound. It is simple, catchy rock with good lyrics and singable melodies. It is definitely one I bring on every road trip to keep me going. Not every song on this album is peppy per se, but it is still good singable tunes. Lyrically, the subject matter is not always peppy either but some how the music is so good that it always makes me happy. The must-hear tracks on this album are, ""Down Together"" which is a funny sort of love song, ""Mekong"" which is probably the best track on this cd, and ""Banditos"" which is a humorous outlaw song and the perfect roadtrip song."
3,Decent rental...,"It was a decent flick. Not bad or the best. Wouldn't want to pay to see it at a movie theater, but good for a rental. I like Emily Blunt so that helped."
5,good movie,I like Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it is very good storyI like Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it is very good story
3,Nice story,Enjoyed the whimsical story line. The photography was quite nice and added to the whole plot line. Would watch it again.
4,A surprise of a movie!,"Ewan McGregor gives an outstanding performance. Very well done. And the story line is interesting; it makes you stop and think of the possibilities. For the most part, the scientific references behind the project were accurate; a few mistakes but those can be overlooked in the grand scheme of things. It was a pleasant and enjoyable surprise; much better than I'd expected."
5,Salmon Fishing,"An excellent film!! I love the casting, the filming too, and the story is touching. Ewan McGregor is a favorite."
4,Great Move,Loved it- but I love everything that Ewan Mcgregor is in. I just wish infidelity wasn't in every movie these days.
4,very good movie.,I liked it. Great movie. Nice story. Very good acting. Thumbs up from me. Like to see more like this one.
4,Salmon fishing bringing people together,"""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is a romantic comedy-drama genre film.The denotations and connotations of the narrative are guided around salmon fishing, yet there are micro and macro implications as a result of this. On one hand the idea of bringing salmon fishing to the Yemen presents as a wishful and near impossible task. On the other hand the viewer is presented with a situation where this same goal allows people of different circumstances and racial and cultural backgrounds to find unison working on the project.The film characters are all unique and developing salmon fishing bonds them as a group, which helps them through their own personal challenges, and to find a spark that is missing in their lives.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,Meh.,I was looking for something more profound about middle eastern relations. Instead I got a tepid british comedy. Would not recommend.
3,Fun movie,Its an OK film. Love the premise and the fact that it transcends cultural stereotypes. Better seen on DVD but probably not a keeper.
2,I hate to say I didn't it like it.,It was nice but I couldn't buy into the love story or the importance of salmon fishing in the desert. I like emily Blunt and Ewan MacGregor but somehow this story fell flat.
3,Pretty predictable,"Ewan McGregor is always a pleasure to watch and I would definitely recommend this for family viewing in the rom-com genre (although a little light on the com). However, if you're looking for interesting plot twists, depth, or originality, I would look elsewhere."
4,Cute Movie,"I was intrigued by the title and Ewan is a great actor. Very well done heartwarming story, I would recommend it to my mother."
1,Idiotic,"This is one of the worst movie I have ever watched. It lacks even the minimal cinematographic appeal, not to mention the story line..."
1,Not what we expected,"Well if you are looking for a faith based movie - this is not one. Don't be fooled by the previews. We thought this was a PG movie... glad the kids weren't watching. There is plenty of cursing, foul language, adulterous behavior, disrespect, sinful angry parenting, typical ""when marriage gets tough just divorce"", self-centered individuals, sex, etc.... It could of been a good movie. It had talented actors, beautiful back drops, scenery, it was well filmed and crafted... but that all means nothing when you add in all the negatives I mentioned. It's just garbage and worthless- even if there is this little glimmer of hope at the end. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen not what it is proposed as in the previews. Not satisfied."
2,Disappointing,"Just wasn't sure about this one! I usually 100% trust Emily Blunt AND Ewan McGreggor, but this film wasn't my favorite. Felt like it was rushed and predictable. Could have been more understated and less over the top. The landscapes of Scotland and Yemen were, of course, redemptive."
4,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"Nice low key British flick - easy to watch, good chemistry between leads. Especially enjoyed the location filming and various UK accents."
4,Chemistry,I enjoyed it enough that I watched it twice in 24 hours which I rarely do. Emily Blunt is a wonderful actress whether or not she plays the protagonist or antagonistThe Devil Wears Prada. In this delightful romance I found the chemistry with her character and that of Ewan MacGregor a very sweet addition to the story of the salmon and how to get them to the Yemen. Anyone with a taste for British humor as displayed in movies such asLove Actually (Widescreen Edition)orPirate Radiowill probably enjoy this movie.
5,Sweet & Funny with Happy Ending,I thought this movie was sweet and funny. It had a happy ending which is the kind of movie I like. Definitely a chick flick in my opinion.
5,Salmon fishing,"The movie is great. Very funny touching and easy to watch.I would rent it anytime, men and women will both enjoy"
3,hollywood show,"decent movie, always disappointing after reading the book. Liked some of the twists that were different from the book actually. But as a fishermen it left much to be desired. Except one really amazing cast."
3,"I liked the idea of the movie, but...","I didn't really appreciate how Ewan McGregor went about ending his marriage. True, his wife was a bit of a cold fish, no pun intended, but when she realized they were in trouble she still wanted to at least try. He just wanted what he wanted. I realize it's a movie, but I feel it encouraged the attitude of ""it isn't working, just get a divorce"". If he hadn't been married, this movie would have been not just a great story, but a great love story. I realize my views sound outdated, but I don't think there is anything outdated about trying to fix and find a solution to a ""broken"" marriage."
5,Totally enjoyable movie; Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"Emily Blunt portrays the upbeat consultant character wonderfully. The story has it peaks and valleys but moves quickly past the bumps to keep your interest. First you want to believe, then you do believe, but the story twists and gives you valid reasons to doubt whether the story will end the way you are expecting and then.... Overall a must watch!"
5,The Arabic Dreamer,Romantic love story with a dream of Arabic man who wants a better life for his people. This dream could not be achieved without forcing difficulties.
2,Cool idea but not attention-grabbing,I liked the premise but it really didn't hold my attention. The cinematography was beautiful as were the actors which made it more enjoyable.
2,Boring,Love Emily blunt but couldn't make it thru this boring movie.no chemistry between characters and plot left a lot to be desired
3,Overrated movie,"Got it because of the reviews and Oscar nominations. It's a nice, pleasant movie, but not an Oscar contender, in my opinion."
3,Not as bad as I feared,"My girlfriend likes to watch as many as possible of the Golden Globe and Oscar nominated movies before the awards ceremonies. Since I did not recall this movie being at the theaters, I was dubious. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was not the best movie I saw in the past year, but it was better than I expected."
3,OKay,I would not rent it again because it was not a very good movie. If you want people to review movies and books you should not require so many words or people will not do so.
4,A pleasant surprise,"This movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I did not know what to expect with this movie, but the story line was good and the movie flowed easily, retaining my atten till the end"
4,likeably quirky,The love story elements were somewhat predictable until the end when your not quite sure who will win out. Likeable characters
2,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,This movie was very slow from the beginning.....a British production and their dialogue and sense of humor is different from mine.....sorry I even bought this dvd.
4,Salmon fishing in the Yemen,"Very enjoyable movie. Except for one very small bedroom scene, good for the family. That makes it PG 13.Pleasant story. Good acting. All around very nice."
5,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing!!!!!!!!!!I cannot say enough good stuff about this movie! it was funny, feel good, romantic. hopeful, interesting, greatcasting, beautiful photography and wonderful, believable content. Call me crazy but I've seen it 8 times so far!!I've recommended it to dozens of people; all who have come back and thanked me whole heartedly!"
4,Good chick flick,This movie was intertaining and kept my attention. If you are into comedy romance then this film is a good bet.
3,"Predictable plot, leaves you empty at end","Rented this because it was nominated for some awards and my wife is a journalist covering the Award shows. From beginning to end this movie was very predictable and provided few surprises. The characters never really developed to a point that you care deeply about them or their plight. The subject matter is a bit droll as well. We all know that if you dump enough money into something you can make it happen, and this movie tries to make salmon fishing in Yemen inspiring, but its not. Its a caricature of what the mideast has come to symbolize: extravagance of the super-rich. This film makes a caricature out of the media industry and politics as well showcasing how people manipulate events to their advantage for short term selfish gain. You end the movie wondering if you learned anything new and realize you did not. I rated it 3 stars because I like Ewan MCGregor and enjoyed his performance."
3,Sweet but predictable,"A attempt at a sweet romantic comedy, though rather unbelievable and contribute. Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor make a good rffort to give the movie substane. Recommend it as a pocorn movie to relax an evening away."
4,Good movie,"Pleasantly surprised with the humor and warmth. At times the romantic plot a bit predictable, but didn't detract from the enjoyment."
2,Lots of fun!,"I was in Fla. visiting with my 100 year old dad. I took ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" with me and we thoroughly enjoyed watching it together! He recommends it too. P.S. He still has all his marbles to enjoy it with too. KH"
1,Shameful,"One star is too much. The only feeling that all those good actors could transmit was the embarrassment of being involved in that movie . I hope that they donated their earnings to charity...in that case I give 5 stars. The only good part was the ending, because it happened."
2,Salmon fishing in yemen,I fell asleep. I am not sure it would go over after what happen in Libya with the bombingNever forget 9-11-01 or 9-11-12
3,Cute,"One Friday evening, when our choices on cable television were absolutely dismal, we chose to downstream this movie to our TV. The story was cute, not mind-bending or intense or theatrical, but enjoyable."
2,OH NO!,"seriously! who let this film out of the editing bay without CUTTING it! It has so much potential, and I thought it would a cute movie. The only excuse I can give it is that they must have tried to follow too closely to the book... which was a mistake. The film is WAY to long and tries to cover too many issues. The only good thing about it is Emily Blunt, who is decent, but it's not even worth a rental. So sad, it could have been a great film. (and I'm speaking as a professional editor)."
3,Had hoped for better...,Not that it was bad... Mainly... Just too predictable. Gald we waited for the video release rather than seeing in a theater.
4,Salmon Fishing In Yemen,"I found this video enjoyable. It depends on what you are looking for in a plot. This movie in my opinion is about uniting cultures and within each culture their is division even amongst themself. It is ot a film that's over the top, just light and enjoyable for a rainy weekend."
1,I fell asleep,"I fell asleep during this movie. The ending was predictable and Hollywood-ish, but sweet. Very long in the middle for me"
4,Good Move,I've seen Ewan McGregor in better movies (e.g. Moulin Rouge) but this one was still enjoyable. Just saw Emily Blunt in Argo and she was very good in both movies.
4,Excellent Story with a Touch of Humor,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The story line was very original. It had something for everybody; passion for doing something that you love to do, sports (fishing that is), a love story, politics and humor...lots of it. The acting was excellent and the scenery was wonderful. I have now seen it twice and enjoyed it as much the second time around as I did the first time."
4,Good movie,This is a movie about kind hearted people with the happy ending I love. The humor is the British kind with irony and dry wit.
4,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,"This was a great movie - not too predictable, beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice"
4,Great good feeling story,"Excellent acting, some parts predictable ... good movie family can watch. Not one I need to see multiple times -- so good instant video selection."
4,Enjoyable,I very much enjoyed Salmon Fishing in Yemen. It was just a good wholesome movie that the whole family could enjoy
4,Intriguing fantasy,Unusual story line with a few rather forced transitions. Amusing caricatures of various political types. Quite entertaining if you are willing to suspend a bit of disbelief.
4,Feel good movie,"A sweet, quirky if somewhat predictable film. Good acting, especially Kristin Scott Thomas, who keeps the movie from being a tad too sentimental."
4,Simply A Good Movie,"great screen play. great characters. This is a movie that couples can enjoy. Just the right amount comedy, conflict, and chick flick."
4,Inspirational film,The story is good for the inspirational type of movie to keep on trying the impossible. It is a feel good movie.
4,Salmon Fishing in our Lives,This movie is saved by some good acting. In addition there are some wonderful metaphorical hints about our own lives.
4,"Good, positive movie with believable cast","I enjoyed this movie. It isn't an Oscar contender, but it was a pleasure to watch. Would recommend it to someone who wants to watch something enjoyable. I love Lasse Halstrom movies."
4,Good movie,I really enjoyed this movie. Simple and sweet. The actors were great and a very nice storyline. Would highly recommend
4,Four Solid Stars,"No a bad Movie, Well acted great original story and clean ending. decent date movie if your looking for something fun and light."
4,A story about hope and suceeding,"It had a very good story, about hope. Something that was thought impossible, was possible. It was about what could be done."
2,"Cute idea, poorly executed","It was a pleasant idea for a movie, with a poorly executed and unrealistic plot (not that all plots are realistic). It was just too far fetched for my taste, though it did have a somewhat positive message."
4,Heartwarming and uplifting!,"A Heartwarming, witty, romantic comedy with much to make it stand out from the countless formulaic flicks out there. Emily Blunt is marvelous!"
5,So cute!,"Just a fun, whimsical, different kind of film. Interesting story, good acting. Leaves you smiling. Ewan McGregor is always a pleasure to watch."
4,"Charming, tender and funny.",A movie certainly worth viewing. I liked it a lot....the ending was predictable but that didn't matter. It's a feel good movie.
2,That's fishing for you...,"Starts off full of enthusiasm for a what promises to be a highly entertaining way of passing the time. And, once things get going, there are a couple of excellent ""nibbles"" that heighten the expectation of what's to come. But then things start to drag - nothing much happens and a feeling of creeping boredom sets in as you desperately wait for another ""nibble"" to keep your interest up. No luck, and then to make things worse everything starts getting rather wet. By the end of it all you leave feeling pretty disappointed. Ah well... that's fishing for you."
3,Entertaining,"We watch anything with Ewan McGregor in it. Not a great movie, and a little disjointed, but overall it was entertaining and enjoyable."
1,Salmon fishing in Yemen,"One of the most predictable plots ever! A total disapointment, a waste of time. I cannot understand how this film received such positive reviews."
3,Amusing and Harmless,Amusing romantic comedy. The plot requires suspension of disbelief on many fronts. High feel good score. Good cast with good performances.
5,My review..........,Really liked the movie......British....so it's NOT as streamlined as an American movie ! If I remember right.....NO profanity. Downhearted & basic....very enjoyable.
3,Not as good as the book.,Quite enjoyed watching this movie but disappointed that all the ironic humour was taken out of it. Also the changed ending spoilt it for me. But acting was good and scenery was beautiful.
4,So Enjoyable,"This movie made me happy. No new ground broken here. Just a quirky story about love and hope acted by great actors. If you like these actors and director, you'll like this movie.It's sweet and has a happy ending....sometimes you just need to watch a movie like this !"
3,Fishing in the Yemen,Not too bad. Good entertainig little gem. The three main actors do a good job of keeping it all together.
4,wonderful warm love story,While the title would leave you to believe that this is a fish tale...it's truly a well written touching love story.
4,Fun movie,An enjoyable feel good movie that was well acted.The writing for the supporting characters tends to be a bit thin.
1,Do not buy this printer!,"Mine broke down with a ""carriage jam"" error just out of 1-year warranty. I paid HP $50 for a remanufactured one which broke down with the same problem in less than a month. Now they won't do anything but make me wait two weeks to repair the remanufactured printer.Color quality is good, but the paper feed mechanism sucks! It will claim there is no paper when the paper tray is full. It will grab three or four sheets instead of one. It will grab from the bottom tray when you're trying to feed from the top. And it will exhaust an ink cartridge faster than you can believe.Stay far, far away from this one!"
2,Unpredictable...,"I'm a software programmer. Bought this one for a customer to print a3-sized, duplex customs documents. It works, but can be unpredictable. In the same document, the minimum margins where completely different, forcing me to resize the report (irretating). If you want to manually print duplex, you have to make very sure the paper is reloaded properly, because it will eat of the default tray, ruining your duplex print (irretating again). The last years I have been being Canon-printers. Very good - but the Canon i9900 was sold out on our little island where we live, so I moved to HP. Don't if you can avoid it."
3,drags multiple papers into the printer,"Although I'm fairly happy with the print quality just because I use this printer mostly as draft printing, the paper feed sucks big time! For a print job that requires multiple page I basically have to tell the computer to print 1 sheet at a time because it always pulls in several sheets each time.Color printing is satisfactory though not on a top notch level, with new cartridges, which last maybe 10 pages before it starts to deteriate.My darkest curse on I.T. morons"
1,I cannot believe I bought this printer,"We purchased this printer two years ago to print 11x17 plots of engineering drawings (blueprints). The original driver would randomly work and, following the advice of a reviewer, we installed the driver for the HP 9600. Our main problems with this printer are as follows:1. The print file will spool but the printer will not start printing or2. The printer will spit out blank pages.It seems to work marginally better with the 9600 driver and only fails to print on every third or fourth plot now. The only solution seems to be to restart the computer's print spooler but even then it is haphazard as it will then play ""catch up"" and start printing out whatever files are still in the memory.So, listen to all the negative reviews...we cannot all be wrong. I'll never buy another HP printer again."
2,Wastes ink and paper and isn't reliable,"I've had this printer for about 3 years now and I can never depend on it. I put up with it for a while because I couldn't afford to trash it and buy a different model. It'll work fine one second, then another it will print dark on one side and light on the other. Frustrating especially when you are using high-grade, expensive photo paper for portfolio purposes. Now I'm without a reliable large format printer. I will never buy anything HP again. You would think using HP printer cartridges, HP photo paper, and an HP printer that all would go well. That's not the case."
3,Updated Drivers work better,I was having a lot of problems printing in the 13x19 format. It would reject the paper saying incorrect paper size. Then the print spooler would not delete the spooled file unless I rebooted the computer and the printer itself.I went to HPs site and downloaded their bare bones driver and replaced the ones that came on the CD. And amazingly enough so far the 13x19 printing problems are gone!
2,Waste of Money,"I have owned this printer since July, and there has not been a single month when my printer has not had a problem printing. Most often there are either lines in pictures where ink did not print (so white lines) or the colors are all wrong. And HP is bad and returning emails about such problems."
4,Happily Surprised,"I have used this printer for a month without any problems. I primarily use it for AutoCAD drawings with 13"" X 19"" paper and it does a fine job. SLOW, yes, but if you're not in a hurry, the end product is fine for presentation quality architectural, mechanical or electronic drawings. I have not yet tried large photo prints, but the 8.5"" X 11"" photos I've printed look very good. For the cost, this printer is about as good as one can expect for generating ""large format"" drawings. I have had no problems with the paper jamming. The 13"" X 19"" sheets can be fed in from the front just like the 8.5"" X 11"" paper, so you only need access to the front of the printer. So far, both sizes of paper (8.5"" X 11"", and 13"" X 19"") feed and print well, but SLOW. Yeah, the printer has kind-of-a large footprint with regard to width, but that's not unexpected since you're probably buying it for it's wide-printing capabilities."
2,Something went bad fast with this printer,"It started out great. I didn't even use it much as it was reserved for photos and tabloid size printing at work. Then suddenly it couldn't deal with the HP 99 photo ink cartridges anymore. The color photos are atrocious with too much green and black or everything blurry. I tried cleaning heads, doing realignments, changing ink carts. Nothing helped. The photos look okay using just the black and tricolor ink carts. Did something change with the HP 99 ink carts? Did I just get a bad batch? Also, it can't seem to center photos on the page, even if I check emulate laser margins."
3,"Not bad, not great","OK HP have maybe 25% lemon printers, but they have lots.Dunno yet for the 9800. Quality OK. Page size kinda difficult. Price great.Change-more soon."
1,Very dissatisfied,"Bought this for the wife to do some scrapbooking. Thought for sure the other reviewers must have been doing something wrong. Nope. This thing has a mind of it's own...especially if you try to print anything larger than 8 1/2 X 11. HP has not perfected home user wide format printers yet.I returned it for the Canon i9900 wide format printer which, granted, was $100 more but the quality is simply amazing. 91 positive reviews can't be wrong. I was so impressed with the Canon quality that I scooped up a PIXMA 780 All-In-One for myself. Also a tremnedous number of positve reviews there as well. Much cheaper ink, better quality - how did I miss these the first time. Live and learn from my experiences."
1,Ugh!,"My business ordered this printer specifically to print out 11"" x 17"" PDFs for architectural plans. Yeah, good luck with that, because all it did was give the printer a stroke, even at a relatively small filesize. The largest file we could print out at those dimensions was a JPG blown up in size. The instructions are sparse, and HP's website offers no more help in the Troubleshooting section than ""Make sure the printer is plugged in and connected to the computer."" I would warn anyone away from this printer. If you need large-dimension printing, it's useless, and if you need ordinary size, there are cheaper, more reliable printers."
1,Awful!,"This is the worst printer I have ever used! Not professional! Terrible color matching. And, that's IF it decides to actually print something. Usually, it just chews up my paper and spits it out. It ignores all of my settings. Evil, evil, evil!! Stay away from this one! Not even worth $50! Let alone $400!"
1,I will never buy another HP anything again,"I can't take it anymore. I am tired of begging, pleading, restarting my computer and printer over and over again to try and get this to print a freaking sheet. I have absolutely no idea why it is refusing to print right now. The software on this is just unbelieveably bad. This is such an exercise in frustration. I can't tell you how many times I have wanted to beat the thing with a baseball bat. It does a decent job in printing photos -- if you can get it to actually OBEY you -- but I cannot keep wasting half of my afternoon getting it to print one page of a floor plan so I can get on with my workday. I also had a terrible experience with an hp laptop. I'm never buying anything HP ever again. I don't have a lot of other software issues so it is not my system -- it is this piece of garbage printer/software. Don't waste your money on this -- more importantly, don't waste your TIME on this. But if you want to, I will be selling mine used once I've replaced it!"
1,"Low quality ink, won't feed paper and shakes too much","I hate this printer. Strike one: Horrible paper handling. Bought it for printing 12x12"" scrapbook pages along with ordinary correspondence. But not all scrapbook papers are precisely the same size. So if the paper is 11-15/16"" instead of 12"" it is stupidly rejected. It often chews up cardstock by twisting it sideways and doesn't like photo paper either; annoying in a ""photo"" printer.Strike two: Lousy ink formulation. My old HP 970cxi prints beautifully on vellum that I like to use for overlays and titles. I expected the same with this one. But after struggling to coax the paper thru, the ink just beads up and smears.Strike three: Shakes worse than an old dot-matrix even though it is relatively slow. They must have built it using an old carriage design. I finally moved the printer to a bottom shelf because I worried about my other equipment. You can imagine it doesn't get much use anymore.What a waste of money!"
1,NO SPARE PARTS,"I bought it in 2006, now, after 4 years..no more spare parts, so I have to throw it to the garbage..."
1,Beware changing cartridges,"Add me to the list of victims of a lousy design that breaks on the first cartridge change. There's a badly mounted spring to the side of the cartridge, which when you pull out the old cartridge, can fall out of place. Then when you push in the new cartridge, the flailing spring pokes a hole in the fragile ribbon cable on the PCB. Now the printer is dead. Oh, you can purchase a new PCB/ribbon cable for the price of a new printer. Ha ha time to look at Canon printers!!"
1,"Beware, fatal design flaw","Search google for ""hp deskjet 9800 black cartridge problem"" - these printers have a serious flaw that HP seems disinterested in addressing. Numerous people (myself included) have had to throw these away after the print cartridge carriage exerts a damaging force on the connecting PCB, effectively disabling one or more of the cartridges (for me, black)Sadly, as nice as this printer's output and large-format capabilities are, it's simply not OK for a printer to fail after a few cartridge changes and be abandoned by the manufacturer.The worst part: you suspect a bad cartridge, so you buy a brand spanking new one from HP, and it still reports as failed.Good way to get suckered on to throw good money after bad.Poor show, Hewlett Packard...."
5,awesome large format printer,I love the feature of printing with no bleed and large format. I can print poster size edge to edge with this printer.The quality is excellent for a inkjet. I also tried with a photo paper and happy with the result.
2,Poor quality - only good for the very basics,"Negatives -Constant problems when printing anything over 10 pages at a timeMultiple page pick upsFrequent paper jamsNoisy and not very fast in fast normal modeHp says printing on both sides of paper may actually cause multiple page pick ups, so be warned if you intend to create booklets.Positives -Good for regular quality, small numbers of single sided prints."
5,Works very well,"I purchased this ink cartridge for my Canon Pixma ip6000D printer and it works really well. It is easy to install on the printer, no mess at all. It prints right away. As far as I can tell, it is just as good as the genuine Canon brand ink cartridge but it is a lot less expensive. I will recommend it."
5,Cheap and worked great,Took about ten test sheets to get the ink flowing right but eventually everything started working great. I would purchase again.
4,Good debut from RZA protege,"This CD has a good vibe. I've listened to it everyday since I got it. Definitely geared toward a younger crowd, but still entertaining to older Wu fans. RZA has 3 good beats on here. Free Murda brings the dope on all tracks. I have several favorites. Pick it up and support the Fam. You're be pleased."
2,What the hell?,"I'll be honest by saying I was interested in this cd just because RZA's name was on it...but this cd is straight garbage!!! Free's rhymes are weak and his flow is even worse. Some beats are OK which is why I gave it even 2 stars. But for any Wu fans like me, stay away from this pile of crap!! What ever happened to the Wu syndicate?"
3,I wish it was longer,"I had seen them in Cleveland a few nights before this performance. The set list is different and ends just short of an hour. I had the misfortune of having to leave the Cleveland concert early so I know I had to have missed about 7 or more songs. I was looking forward to hearing again what I saw that night ""Flying"" and others. Vernon gives some quotable sermons which is both an extra and interweaved within the concert tracks. I really hope these guys stick around. They are my second favorite band and a DVD release is probably a big step for them in this day and age of burning and pirating discs."
5,Organic Gardening's All-time Best Gardening Secrets,"Excellent resource, clear and direct. For those who are serious about improving the health of yourselves, your families and ultimately the planet through your own food and environments, I recommend obtaining Book 1 of the Anastasia series available at [...]"
5,Great Concert !!! Great sound quality,This is a Great Concert doesnt get any better than this I really enjoyed it !!!
4,INCOGNITO Live in Jakarta,"Para los aficionados a la musica de fusion, aqui tienen un plato fuerte para disfrutar.Buen dvd con imagenes aceptables y buena calidad musical"
2,SOME MOMENTS BUT.....,I Have abut 10 cd's of this band (and not all with and with Maysa Leeks)I was really expecting somthing speical.When I got this dvd I was amazed to find that most of the singers were there ( like a reunion )with the exception of British singer Carleen Anderson.The set list was a real problem for me because it did not allow forsome of these Great vocalist to show their talents.I feel Maysa was completly wasted on this and the song selections made this set seem boring.This could have been really great. It has it moments but let's you down in the end.
1,Offensive,"Even though I haven't read this book, I feel I have to comment based on the other comments. If I'm understanding them correctly, the book claims that there are no satanic cults and no ritual abuse. Well, excuse me, but I am a victim of ritual abuse. For anyone to claim otherwise is offensive to me and my memories. I have post traumatic stress disorder because of the abuse so no one can tell me that nothing happened. I know what I saw."
3,"shimano pedals are excellent, but the plastic breaks on these.","I've extensively used several pairs of shimano clipless pedals. These particular pedals work great and all of the metal in them works perfectly and has great longevity and durability. However! the plastic cage breaks rather easily. Supposedly they are replaceable, but I have not found the replacements. if you're using these for mountain biking or they might otherwise strike rocks, go with the 545's. I own those too and they work quite well."
4,My first clipless pedals... great for MTB,"I use these with some Specialized shoes and they are easy to adjust for breakaway pressure. I have been slowed up unexpectedly on trails and the panic mode of trying to put a foot down is enough to break free without falling over. Also, the platform is nice, as you can start pedaling and not be fully clicked in yet and eventually find the right spot."
1,Squier is underrated,"While it's true this compilation contains some glaring omissions, on balance, it has nearly all of Squier's most well-known hits. It's also true that, for casual listeners, Squier's Greatest Hits cd will probably suffice. For long-time fans, however, the gems here are the first two tracks from Squier's mid-70s stint with Piper. Material from Piper is unavailable elsewhere and, frankly, I'm amazed those two albums have not been re-released. Squier's work with Piper was a precursor to fine-tuning his rock-pop sensibilities obvious in his later more popular periods. This compliation would have been better served had it been a true career retrospective and included a few more Piper tunes. All in all, not a bad effort, just not inclusive enough."
5,Each story could be a novel in itself,"Winterson's fiction is compelling because she teaches a little bit about the physical world while at the same time leading the reader on a spectacular emotional journey. She is like a naturalist of the inner life, pointing out highlights along the way. Her writing is so beautiful it may make you cry."
3,Good book,"I bought this book to help me out in an advanced mechanics course I'm taking right now. Even though the notation is old, it's still quite a useful book."
3,It's okey,Dear Sir/ MadamI love that item. It's okey for my studied. I think it good usage for the student.Thank youFrom Sophat UN
3,A mixed bag,"There are some interesting aspects of this book, particularly the chapters on the NYSE specialist system. This seems to be the author's area of expertise.As a professional trader, however, I think the author overstates the difficulty in trading NASDAQ stocks and the level of manipulation in the OTC market. Also, some of the information here is inaccurate. For example, he states that momentum traders avoid stocks like Intel, Cisco, and Microsoft. This is not true. I personally trade literally hundreds of thousands of shares of these stocks daily. In addition, he vastly overstates the volatility of NASDAQ stocks, saying that ""500 share buy orders will drive the stock up 2 points"". This is ridiculous.All in all, not bad. The NYSE information is good, but take the NASDAQ chapters with a grain of salt."
3,"Great book, don't day trade","Read this, it will add to your education as an investor. Hopefully in the course of reading it you will realize that day trading involves capitalizing on the momentary flux of supply and demand, and thus really has nothing to do with long-term investing, i.e., anything longer than a few minutes. Read about it, but don't do it. The author purports to tell you to how to get around market manipulation by professional traders (market makers and specialists). Isn't just knowing that such people are manipulating the market and competing against you enough? Not to mention all the other day traders out there! Wise up."
3,Gives a good understanding of out the market works.,"This is a beginner's book that gives a good description on how the NASDAQ and NYSE differ. It is easy to read but to wordy. The techniques that are described seem to only be touched upon and he is pushing one of his video courses thought the book. The basic points do get across, buy when the big money is buying and sell when the big money is selling, don't pay the spread on the bid ask price, and beware of the specialist in the NYSE. Again a lot of words but not much substance on how to make money and employ these techniques in any depth. It is a beginner's book all the way."
5,High Marks For Clarity and Content,"I want to make a few comments - I bought this book and then I bought the two volume video version of it - I give both items high marks for clarity - Farrell takes some very difficult concepts and breaks them down into understandable morsels - for you football fans out there, Farrell's style is very similar to the ""Fox Scope"" that breaks down football plays - the author tells it like it is in this book, spending just as much time on the dangers of day trading as he does on how to make money doing it -"
4,A Few Trading Tips,"This book was very good back in it's day. I think the author should publish a revized edition with more up to date strategies.When trading short term one needs to realize that the stock market can present us with a lot of hot stocks every day.Most of them may seem promising, but the truth is that a good number of these trading & investing opportunities might not be as profitable as one might think. That's why it's very important to know how to choose them especially if you plan to take advantage of them on a daily or weekly basis.One site that I recommend is MomentumStockTrading com. They have a pretty clear way for trading hot stocks with momentum using easy to understand strategies. This is also a place where you can learn why knowing how to manage the stock rally is critical to your success."
3,Almost but not quite,"The Authors first book was worth the read and opened areas that most day traders were unaware of. More importantly they worked. Here there is also worthwhile information. However, some of the methods described could easily lead to financial death. This is covered by the authors comments ""for experience or professional traders"". However the risk is so great it causes the reader to wonder if anyone has every tried these methods off the floor. If you know the subject this is a good book to add to your collection. But, don't try this at home."
4,Good introduction to the day trading mentality,"First book I read on day trading, explains the games other traders are playing to help you identify what is happening in a stock as you watch it intraday.Very insightful on institutional price manipulation, how we as the little fish can get on the right side of the smart money and swim with them to quick profits.Good info not commonly shared or explained as well as this."
5,A Different Sound? A Better Sound.,"This is not ""Silent Alarm II"". Bloc Party (wisely, in my opinion) decided to step in a new direction. Gone are the guitar riffs of ""Helicopter"" and Matt Tong tones back his trademark stacatto drumming slightly (but still manages to be a complete beast). In are more meaningful lyrics, a deeper, richer and fuller sound, and, above all, a more mature sound. This is definitely a band that is maturing and discovering what it wants to be and sound like, hence the huge differences between the sounds of ""Silent Alarm"" and ""A Weekend in the City"". However, do not mistake this difference for weakness. ""Weekend"" is a strong album and a great album, and hopefully a barometer of what Bloc Party will be doing in the future."
3,similar opinion,"I just don't like the new sound. Sure they've grown, but it's not the growth most fans were looking for. They simply just deviated too far from the new post-punk sound they created on Silent Alarm. The lyrics however are a little more interesting, and little more introspective. I'd give this album 3 1/2 stars mostly impart to the song Kreuzberg, which is hauntingly perfect. Probably one of my personal top five favorite Bloc Party songs."
2,musical disappointment of the year,"I'm not going to devote a lot of time to this review, because Bloc Party didn't devote a lot of time to their new album. I will say that the people who gave this album 5 stars are in denial and in a couple months they'll be using this CD as a drink coaster. How bad is this CD? Well, I'll be selling Bloc Party concert tickets if that's any indication."
3,I'll say this...,"Nobody will ever accuse their singer of being his generation's best songwriter. A lot of really good songs are hamstrung by crappy lyrics in my opinion. Your mileage, of course, will vary. And where Silent Alarm demands your attention, with a few exceptions this CD will fit right in with your housecleaning discs."
3,Could be better,But not bad. It's a little darker and more serious than Silent Alarm. Not as many danceable tracks. Still pretty good though.
3,"We're So Bored, So Entertain Us (lyrics from Uniform)","Honestly, I was so disappointed in this new album that I had to listen to ""Silent Alarm"" again --just to redeem the band in my mind. I saw them play Alarm live too, and it was awesome! However in ""Weekend,"" the lyrics were down-right boring and formulated. There are a few catchy bits -- like in ""Hunting for Witches"" -- which were reminiscent of Silent, but overall, I would wait to buy this CD real cheap or check out a friend's copy first.It's definitely NOT anything like Silent Alarm --if that's what you were looking for, but perhaps it will grow on me..."
2,Weekend in the cd,The album is ok. Bloc Party has grown as a band but this cd lacks whatever made the last album great.
5,Loved it,"This album is solid from front to back. They strike a great balance between hard, mellow, and rock. Many of the songs are very catchy and easy to listen too. Is it their best album, maybe not but it is still a wonderful album. I look forward to following this bang as they grow because they have some real talent."
4,Very Solid,"Of course nothing could beat Silent Alarm, this is still a great album. These guys are filthy."
2,Dissapointed,"I don't like having to write negative reviews...however. I am pretty enthusiastic about much of the new music that gets played on alternative radio (such as the almighty KEXP in Seattle) and thus bought this CD based on the buzz around this band. Unfortunately, I didn't hear much to match the hype. The singers voice quickly grated on my nerves and repeated listens only verified my first impression. Sorry."
2,No edge...,"Don't tag this as ""indie"" or ""alternative"" There is absolutely nothing exciting or indie about this album. The quirky, rough-around-the-edges, diverse songs of the first album have been replaced by top 40 radio wannabee garbage. I think even the band members know how horrible this album is compared to the first. They'll be opening for John Mayer or Matchbox 20 soon...."
2,Party pooper,"I was very disappointed with this latest album. There were only one or two songs I could find any redeeming qualities in. Stick with ""Silent Alarm."""
3,horrible sound quality,"how do you review an album that was apparently recorded on itunes? What is this.. a recording at the lowest quality mp3 kbps? My ears yearn for something that sounds like a band should sound on a major label. 8-tracks probably sound better. Bloc Party, you should be ashamed. Garbatio endito!"
2,Let down for me 2.5 Stars,"I had very high expectations as well. I got an advanced copy of this album months ago... gave it MANY spins hoping to feel the same spark as with their debut. The song production is overzealous, and has none of the the grit, hooks, and thrive as their previous effort. Too ambitious in my opinion and nothing really sticks."
2,big let down,"I need to throw in a desenting opinion. I'm a huge BP fan and pretty well wore out Silent Alarm, which I thought was the runaway disc of the year. Maybe my expectations were too high then because this disc is totally uninspiring. I don't doubt that the lyrics are timely, thought provoking, and occasionally poetic, but the tunes are just boring. I'm not a musician or music critic, but I know what I loved about Silent Alarm - edgy lyrics, unique compositions, great hooks, and damn catchy beats. Hell, it gave rise to a remix version. This effort loses me entirely and is more apt to put me to sleep than out dancing.I'll give it another try to see if I can drink the Kool-Aid like many other reviewers seem to have done. In the meantime, call me bored and very disappointed."
1,Wretched sound!,"In spite of what a previous reviewer said this is not a good example of 1950's monaural sound. Since this is a live performance you expect to hear stage noises and distractions. But should everything have to sound so distant? The original engineers did not do a good job recording the work and you can't restore sound if the master recording is bad.The question is how good is the performance? Is it worth listening to despite the poor sonics? Not really. This may be a good performance, but it's hardly a great one. There are many better mono performances, let alone stereo ones. There's nothing wrong with the singers or conductor in this recording, but their performances are surpassed by other artists. These other artists are, of course, recorded in much better sound!"
3,"Sturdy, but not as practical as it could be","Length:: 1:27 MinsI purchased this case for my Casio Exilim EX-FH100 high speed point and shoot camera. As you can see from my video review, the case is a bit snug for this camera and it may not be practical for storing spare memory cards."
5,Lowepro products rarely disappoint,"This is the fourth Lowepro case I own including a large camera back pack and the smaller Rezo 10. They are all well made and designed for their intended purpose. The Rezo line comes in progressively larger sizes to match any compact camera on the market. The Rezo 20 is perfect for the Canon S90 and has space with a separate flap for spare SD cards. The belt loop is well designed, large, stiff and has both velcro and a safety snap to keep it from coming undone. Because of its design, it can be attached to your belt without taking your belt loose. Overall, this is an excellent product that will last for years."
4,"Good protection, compact size","I was looking in local stores for the LowePro D Res 10 AW, which garnered good reviews here on Amazon. I was looking for a compact protective case to clip onto a belt. A shoulder strap for such a tiny camera bag is cumbersome. However, the best I could find was the Rezo 20, which turned out to be a good fit for my Canon A540. The Rezo 20 seems to be padded fairly well, and the belt clip, although only with a single velcro patch closure, seems relatively sturdy. I would probably clip the neck strap around my belt as a safety strap in case the velcro lets go while walking or hiking. The front pocket holds batteries and a memory card could probably be squeezed in there too. Time will tell how well it works, but I'm optimistic that it'll do."
2,She can do much much better !,For an American Old Timey Banjoist she appears to have tried really hard not to play her Banjo at all!The CD is Ok if you like singing but it is very weak if you like OT Banjo.An older and far better recording can be found in Hedy West ...
1,Dont buy this!,"This film is so bad that within 5 minutes, I had to put it in the garbage! They had no budget and its worse than a home made film! Stay away from it..."
3,"Kenya"" The Ultimate African Experience""","This video gives a very good overview of the wildlife parks in Kenya. However, it provides only little information about the culture and society of Kenya."
3,Kenya Commercial,"Not enough real Kenya, like Mombasa, Nairobi, Lamu etc - too much commerial advertisment - nice shots in general."
5,"Great book, but very intense","This is a wonderful book. Their are numerous examples from the world over of the widespread worship of the yoni as illustrated thru the many works of art left to us by our ancestors. This book is not for everyone though. If you are not comfortable with the female body this book may be too much for you. The close-up images of human yonis are hard to look at when you are raised in Western society and taught to see female genitals as ""dirty"" or ""nasty"".However, this book is vital if you want to learn and see the history of humanity's reverence for the Goddess and Women. It provides several different types of information, definitions and imagery about yonis in a clear and direct way. If you are ready to challenge your patriarchal cultural conditioning, this book will do it.Calysta Rose [calysta@esoterika.com]"
3,A good beginning,"This book is a good beginning to research on the yoni, or female genitals, as objects and subjects of religious and spiritual practice. However, it is not thorough and an agenda is clear -- there need to be far more citations to really prove some of the touted ""facts"". The book approach several different topics but none with a great deal of depth or undenialable evidence. The pictures, and there are many of them, are beautiful. If you are looking for ways to incorporate the yoni into your spiritual life this book will help you -- but I don't think it will satisfy the serious scholar."
5,We loved it,"This movie is only a 4 star movie but I'm giving it 5 because it was so much fun. I watched it with my wife who laughed even harder than I did even though she doesn't understand French, so I guess that means that the subtitles are pretty good too. It's a comedy that isn't afraid to bring up some tough questions too. Marie Bunuel was great as Sacha, so full of uncertainty and insecurity, kinda reminded me of myself sometimes. I really identified with her state of mind. The woman who played her mom was terribly funny. I'm so glad I bought this, it just made for a really fun evening."
4,Clear and Concise,"Gives a nice overview on what your business options are in the world of Scrapbooking. From the retail store to teacher Steligo gives you information on how to choose the right scrapbooking opportunity for you. Additionally, she references many books and publications that will help you on your journey!"
3,fluff,"I read this book cover to cover in under an hour. It had a few good ideas. But save your hour researching online instead where you'll find the same info and then some. The table of contents is useful for brainstorming, but this is not a comprehensive book for a serious entrepreneur."
3,outdated,"The author included references to many online sources. Unfortunately, many of the links are outdated and the company information can't be found. But the general overview of setting up a business was great."
1,None of the hits plus more,Since these remake never were hits. Even worse without Peter Noone. Selling CD like this it's a legal way to steal. Thousand of people buy this CD hoping they will get the original recordings.
1,Where do they get the balls?,"These are NOT the original recordings. These are NOT the original voices. How they got away with this one is beyond me, but my guess is that this is a release by SOME, but not all, of the original band -- without the talent that was involved with the classics. If you don't care about that, the versions here are more than competent, but I would just as well purchase what the product purports to be."
3,Don't drop it!!!,"This is a good product and works effectively, BUT whatever you do, do NOT drop it. The battery compartment is on the corner of the bottom of the recorder. The door to this compartment is plastic and VERY FRAGILE!!! The battery is spring loaded and is kept in the compartment by the plastic door. A very tiny piece of the plastic door broke off my recorder when it was dropped and now the door won't close all the way. Because the door won't close, the battery won't stay in and it won't even charge. I sent it back to Olympus for repair. No can do. They said it was ""damaged beyond repair"". So a little plastic piece of a door has completely disabled my $450.00 recorder. Olympus' only suggestion... replacement. What is wrong with this picture???"
3,Lox it ain't,This is a fairly salty (which can be expected from smoked products)fairly dryish solid slab of salmon. I couldn't decide how to use it so it ended up in an omelet and I guess the rest will go into salmon salad.
2,"Tased like canned salmon, expensive canned salmon!",There was little to no taste difference in the 3 fish. Very flaky and dry with NO smoked flavor. The fish in all the pouches were crushed and almost to a mush. I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
5,Smoked Salmon Trio.,My husband loves the product. Excellent flavor. The box gives you recipes. We tried the pasta with smoked salmon. Deliscious. Worth the purchase.
1,Yuck,"This is far too overpriced, you get three small filets that have a terrible smell to them, almost like day old tuna. It works out to about 12 dollars for a 6 oz salmon filet that really isn't even good. You can get it fresh, minus the horrible smell and not already precooked. To be perfectly honest, a can of bumblebee tuna would be better than this and it would cost you 35 less dollars, I only purchased it by mistake and the seller immediately hit the shipping soon button and would not stop shipment even after request. Worst transaction I've had on Amazon to date.I couldn't even stomach to taste it, that's how bad the smell was, huge waste of money, just go to the store and get a filet yourself, cheaper and better quality."
4,"Good selection, good value","I've ordered this a few times for myself and as gifts, and it's always appreciated. Having lived in the Pacific Northwest for a few years, I get that ""deja vu"" feeling whenever I eat salmon smoked the way SeaBear does theirs. Very flavorful and a heavenly snack to accompany your favorite whiskey."
2,Alright,"Nice company, will answer your emails.This fish is ok. Kind of pricey, not that decadent. I'm not sure I would purchase this again. Similar to canned tuna in texture and presentation."
4,YTC,Great tasting salmon trio. The only reason why I gave it four-stars is because it was slightly salty for my taste. Would recommend it to anyone.
3,"Academic thesis, not for everyday study","In seeking to develop a working biblical theology of spiritual warfare, this was far beyond the everyday and broad biblical exposition I was looking for. It is intensive, demanding and specific."
2,Dance Music Fan,"I bought this CD without hearing it first. That was a mistake on my part. I was under the impression that the rest of the CD was going to sound like Right In The Night (Fall In Love With Music).It doesn't and I was very dissapointed. If you are big fan of high energy dance music like me then stay away from this CD. For really good Dance and club music check out Alice DeeJay, Fragma, Ian Van Dahl, DJ Sammy, DJ Encore, ATB, and Sylver!! Don't make the same mistake I did. Peace out"
2,Beware: No Subtitles,"I purchased this film, paid for next day shipping for my Honk Kong cinema class, and I was very disappointed to find out that there was no subtitles. I wish that under the description, it would of stated without subtitles to prevent this mistake from happening in the first place. I write this review in hopes that I can help prevent this from happening to someone else.As far as the film, I thought it was excellent, even though I was forced to watch it at the university library I attend and the quality was not so great."
3,Where's Episode 14?????,I missed the first two hours!! Episode 14. Yet they posted episode 15 the reunion before episode 14? How long before 14 is available? I can only go so long before someone ruins it for me. Please hurry!
1,Why the Charge,"Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website. Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs."
3,Quality,"These are great quality grips, but maybe I am just not the right user for them. I got them to replace stock grips and to relive wrist pain and numbness. they are thick and much better than a lot of grips I had tried, but they didn't' work for me and didn't solve my problems."
5,Great American Product,Easy to install. Used hairspray as recommended by other customers. Looks cool. Inexpensive. Made in USA. Can be shortened easily if necessary.
5,Best grips I've ever owned,"These grips are so comfy. A bit difficult to put on but well worth the struggle, your hands will thank you."
2,Not so secure,"The install instruction states that the grip needs to be ""GLUED""to the handle bar. I don't want to glue it to my carbon handle bar, so I used water as lubricant. After 24 hours, I can still twist the grip. It feels very insecure.I ordered the 22.2mm one, which turns out to be too big. (I wear large gloves)."
4,Oury MTN Grip (Blue),"This product looks great on my bike. Had a little trouble getting the grips to stay in place. Had to use spray adhesive with plastic ""zip ties"" to hold them in place. Once the glue dried I removed the ""zip ties"" and they are staying put. They do tend to get really dirty easily but, they do look good on my bike."
5,GReat grips!,"I just bought oury grips and they are excellent for the price and comfort, what else can I say! I would definitely recommend them."
5,grippy,i really like them.i just got my handlebars moist and muscled them on. i also sat my bike under a heating vent in my room. took a few days for the water to dry out but they're on there real solid now. and they look good too.
4,Inexpensive light kit makes plenty of light,"This kit is definitely white, not the off-white that is common in fans these days. The sockets are for candelabra-base bulbs, which are now available in CFL at Wal-Mart and Lowes. Too bad I can't seem to find light kits that take conventional bulbs anymore, those bulbs are a bit cheaper. The fluted shades are attractive to my eye and have rubber rings for the mounting screws to bite into. Those rubber rings are a nice touch and help keep them quiet.This is not a top-of-the-line product by any means but it does what it is made to do and is both inexpensive and attractive."
2,"Good product, but misleading description","The product works well, however, the light kit does not use E27 base bulbs. It uses the smaller candelabra bulbs and does not come with any CFLs. I would not have paid as much had I known that the product was not as described."
4,these are some of hammer's lesser movies but they are all fine gothic horror films,"while not up to the level of the first hammer box set these films are wonderful and still light years ahead of what most studios call horror movies. ""brides of dracula"",""curse of the werewolf"",and "" evil of frankenstein"" are the best. ""brides was made during the time lee refused to play dracula again so peter cushing as van helsing is the show here,and one of the best vampire deaths ever put on film.olver reed in ""curse"" is very good in this different take on the werewolf legend. cushing is front center again as the mad doctor in ""evil"" and he is as good as ever.the other movies are all fine,but this version of ""phantom"" is very weak, and for hammer lovers like me this is one fine package. the transfers and widescreen are great. enjoy"
5,Great old movies!,"They just don't make 'em like this any more, and nobody ever quite did it like Hammer Studios. These are true gems!"
1,Great set. Horrible defective discs from Universal...again.,"Universal should really stop using dual sided discs. While the quality, and movies in this set are fantastic, the discs are garbage. I was watching The Evil of Frankenstein, with it's eerie atmosphere, and enjoying it, and then it happened. The disc locked up, and wouldn't play again. I had to power my dvd player off, and restart it to eject the disc. I don't know what the problem is at Universal, but the last three sets I purchased(Buck Rogers, Quincy, and of course this one) have all been defective. They are all from Universal, and are all dual sided discs. They all seem to have the same problem of ""locking up"" at one point or another on the set.Universal please stop doing this to consumers. Just recall them until the problem is corrected."
1,Don't buy it.,"They don't work. Bought it first time, doesn't work, returned it for another copy, doesn't work, and FED UP! Hopefully, Universal will recall the product, do a re-vamp, and re-issue it. Unfortunately, the support from the company is non-existent as I e-mailed a complaint to them. Who knows when my suggestion will finally be heeded? Bottom line: attractive product, wealth of titles, and low, cheap price don't translate to money's worth (or headaches in this matter) when it comes to Hammer Horror Series' Eight DVDs."
2,Buyers beware!,Buyers beware!Twice I have bought this collection from different places and on both occasions the picture froze at various times. Evil of Frankenstein is completely unwatchable. Kiss of VAmpire worked well on both + Night Creatures and possibly Phantom of the Opera.Don't buy this collection unless you are absolutely sure that every film is watchable from beginning to end.
1,Defective disk,"Like MANY other people, when I tried watching Evil of Frankenstein, the disk froze up repeatedly and was unwatchable. Looked like a good movie too, judging from the first 5 minutes I was able to see."
4,Good Tales and Better Actors . . with one clunker,"""The Hammer Horror Collection"" is a series of 8 films moving between vampires, an opera ghost, psychological thrillers, and one of the worst mainline Frankenstein films ever made. The collection boasts several performances by Peter Cushing, always a fine actor, and a few by the scene-chewing Oliver Reed--that is, when he is not chewing on the people as a werewolf. The low point comes with ""The Evil of Franksnstein""--which, because of the monster's make-up, just doesn't seem to work. My copy, by the way, did freeze up during one feature--except for that, the collection is fine.This is, however, the second Universal collection that uses advertising from the wrong picture. In one of the Gary Cooper collection, the photos from ""Beau Geste"" came from the silent-era film with Ronald Colman. The illustrations for ""Phantom"" came from the Claude Rains/Nelson Eddy version. Makes you wonder if such goofs could raise the re-sale value???"
2,missing movie,"I recieved 2 of disc 1, I was going crazy trying to understand where was the other movies until I read the disc and they both ssaid the some thing, that's when I notice that I was missing disc 2. Where is it I would like to have my movies!"
3,Wonderful Movies ruined by cheap duplication defects,"I love these Hammer Horror movies, particularly CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF and BRIDES OF DRACULA. When I saw MCA was releasing all their Hammer titles in one DVD set, I pre-ordered it immediately. So far I have had two of these DVD sets, both defective. The quality of the movies themselves, picture and sound-wise, look very good, but the DVDs lock-up, freeze, simply are so badly manufactured that the joy of buying this set quickly goes away. Had Universal put one movie per DVD side, this may have saved this DVD set. Squeezing two movies per side - Universal saving a few pennies - has resulted in apparently a whole bunch of defective Hammer Horror Series DVD sets being purchased. How stupid can Universal get? With all the resulting returns of defective product, how is that going to save them money??? Great copies of great movies - if you can get them to play on your DVD player."
5,great collection!,This is a marvelous collection of horror movies starring the exceptional Peter Cushing. I highly recommend this collection as a means of experiencing the way these kinds of films were made.Happy viewing!!
2,good movies defective discs,"I bought these from amazon about 5 years ago. They played well when I got them.The movies were good, I new what to expect from hammer series. This past halloweenI dug them out, tried to play them. Most wouldnt play, they froze, skipped. Most of the movies I had to skip to about 1/2 hr in. I may order the series again, butI will copy them to dvd-r right away, before they degrade. This is prob illegal,but so is ripping mattress tags off. At least I will be able to watch them more than one time."
1,Good movies. Terrible quality DVD.,"I love the movies, but I have no patience with a DVD that keeps freezing up and skipping. Since, according to other customers, mine is not an isolated situation, I am returning the set for a refund. Indeed, this will be the last multiple title/double-sided DVD that I will purchase from Universal."
1,Hooray for the content....BOO for the Double sided discs!,"Why does UNIVERSAL continue to put out GREAT shows and films on two sided, low quality discs??? They are constantly freezing up in my new SONY DVD player and then I have to continue to watch them on my computer DVD drive. It seems many people have these problems with these discs and there must be constant returns to the stores and on-line stores BUT UNIVERSAL continues to issue them this way. I am sure it is all about the $ BUT UNIVERSAL....listen to your customers and do it right in the first place or don't do it at all. 09-29-05 Just received my HAMMER set from AMAZON and as expected the picture froze and pixilated during CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF. UNIVERSAL is creating their own little HAMMER MONSTER by issueing these cheap discs, just like they did with the ABBOTT & COSTELLO films, ADAM-12, DRAGNET and the list goes on and on and on....."
2,Echoing others - Great Movie Set but POOR Quality Discs,"I have to agree with everyone else who has commented that the movies in this offering make up a great set, and the picture quality is fantastic. That is, the quality is fantastic until the defective discs stop playback and lock up the DVD player. Yes, as so many others have mentioned, this is YET ANOTHER Universal Studios release made using defective double sided discs. Why do they bother? It can't be good for Amazon either with customers returning all these defective sets. You'd think the Studio would get the message. I guess I'm just going to quit buying any more Universal releases until they fix this mess."
3,Some movies in this collection 'freeze',"Actually, the two movies I really wanted were ""Night Creatures"" and ""Brides of Dracula"", but this is a great deal for the price. Unfortunately, some of the movies are rendered unwatchable because they freeze during playing. This makes for a frustrating viewing experience. Luckily the two movies I like were able to play through. Given the defects inherent in these DVDs, I would not recommend getting this DVD set. Btw, ""Brides of Dracula"" is not a Christopher Lee vehicle, though it has Peter Cushing as Van Helsing. Here, Van Helsing tracks down a young nobleman/vampire who is inadvertently set loose by a naive schoolteacher and goes on a killing spree, turning delectable young women into vampires. The sets are beautiful, and the production quality is quite impressive. The acting is not too bad, and of course, Peter Cushing shines as usual. ""Curse of the Werewolf"" is also worth a mention here as it features a young Oliver Reed as the accursed werewolf."
1,What a nightmare!!,"I didn't know that this dvd set was a Universal release when I purchased it. I'd had problems with their 2-sided discs before and now I get to relive the experience! I've watched only one film, The Phantom Of The Opera, and it froze up and skipped toward the end of it! I put the disc on my auxillary player and it worked fine. I now dread sitting through the remaining seven wonderful films just waiting for the next technical glitch! Universal takes the enjoyment out of the movie viewing experience with their shoddy sets! They should be ashamed!"
3,It was o.k.,"I expected the movie to be more of a 50's version, what I got was a 60's version and was not to empress."
3,"Great Movies, Bad Discs!",I returned this set because of poor quality. Several movies were unplayable. I am a huge Hammer fan. I will look for several of these titles separately.
3,A nice set for the price,"For the price of a movie ticket, here is a week's worth of entertainment. This Hammer horror collection features eight very different movies, ranging from the mediocre (Brides of Dracula) to excellent (Paranoiac). Despite the title, Night Creatures is not a horror but a historical adventure/suspense film. Unlike a few other reviewers, I haven't had any problems playing the discs."
5,Take a second look at those lobby cards!,"RE: The lobby cards reproduced on the inside of the gatefold cover of this DVD set: Has anyone other than myself noticed that the lobby card supposedly representing Hammer's 1962 ""Phantom of the Opera"" is actually from Universal's 1943 version (showing Claude Rains, in green mask, preparing to drop the chandelier on the audience). Someone in Universal's DVD dept. didn't do their homework, folks. (There must be something about the phantom which inspires confusion: The very same mistake was made in Howard Thompson's otherwise flawless 1970 book, ""The New York Times Guide to Movies on Television"", which is now lamentably out of print.)"
5,Hammer Horrow Series,Excellant quality and sound. I am glad they finally had these Horror classics on DVD. Thank you.
3,Selection could have been a tad better.,"I am a huge fan of Hammer Horror Movies. The Brides of Dracula and The Curse of the Werewolf, were worth the price alone. But I can think of many more Hammer Classics that deserved the DVD treatment more then the other movies on the set. Maybe in the next one...still worth the money though if your a fan."
5,Fantastic,Great collection. A must for any Hammer film fans. The quality of this DVD is beyond expectations. Very highly recommended.
4,"Slick, Entertaining and Hilarious","This movie was funny and very sexy. Two well-dressed, pretty-boy studs set out to take every sexy bimbo for both her money and her body. They set up a ""how to marry a millionaire"" agency and must perform very in-depth sensual interviews with every potential bride. How they go about it is not that original, but the guys do it in such a way that makes this movie entertaining. In the end, they get what they deserve when the beauty they both truly fall for foils them. The guys are real ""men's men"" and the ladies are dressed to kill, when dressed, that is."
3,Nice compact design with fold away prongs,Originally I thought this contained a battery. The illustration does not show the electric socket prongs. Hope this review will keep someone else from making the same mistake. The foldaway design makes it neater and less lethal to carry in your pocket.
5,Great 2-fer.,"Van Damme at his best. Bloodsport is one of his best ""early"" movies and Timecop is one of his best movies ever. Great stories, action and fun to watch. Highly recommend for any Van Damme lovers."
5,A great adventure,"This book contains characters that will live with you for a long time. The book is well-plotted and moves quickly, even though it's a big book. You'll really get your money's worth with this one. I recommend it most highly--a hell of a read!"
3,Helpful DVD if you have a dog,"The DVD shows all the basics for an acupressure session for a dog. As a cat owner who bought the book, ""Acu-Cat,"" from the same company, I wish an acupressure session for a cat also would have been on the DVD. I think the points are harder to find on a cat, and seeing the instructor show the points on a cat would have been helpful."
4,fun book for Irish dancers,My 10 year old Irish dancer enjoyed this mystery. Mystery isn't usually her thing so the tie to her hobby helped get her into a new genre.
1,Skip this one if you want Practical DOE information!!,If you are looking for a book that delivers countless pages of set-up forms and checklists than maybe this book is for you. It focuses mainly on the project management aspect and lightly skims actual DOE philosophy. If you are looking for a text that delivers real information about designed experiments and analysis of experiments there are many others out there that cover these FAR better.
5,Misses the point,"One of these reviewers misses the point entirely. The worst DOE's are designed by statisticians alone , the best are designed with subject matter experts AND a statistician. It is only those that have suffered the curse of an ""expert only"" and a ""statistician only"" that feel the way you do. The technical stuff is trivial, the expert matter is critical, which is what Luftig and Jordan are trying to put together, and to help the academics realize. There IS a process! Get the research question in focus, and go from there. Sounds like you have never actually approached a problem from a realistic point of view in your life (or ran any ""real"" experiments).Mike ( creator and analyzer of more than more actual experiments than you can ever think of)"
5,The little Prince by Alfred Bartles,"Alfred Bartles has written a lovely piece to accompany the ""Little Prince"": He writes so lyrically, with clean, open harmonies that one can feel the effect of the story within the music.Having encountered Alfred Bartles' music elsewhere I can say he has a unique style in all that I have heard. He never forgets to include the actual beauty of music within his compositions."
5,Great reference when using bio-identical hormones,"I keep Theirry Hertoghe's book handy at all times to refer to and educate myself on the use of bio-identical hormones. In combination with Uzzi Reiss' book ""Natural Hormone Balance"" you have a great arsenal to help you work with your doctor to treat hormonal imbalance successfully."
4,great suspense,the movie is very entertainingand the two main stars are both always good in everything they do.halle berryis great looking and very talented actress. kurt russell and are about the same age and i have been a fan of his for his whole carreer.
5,Guide,I would really recommend this book to any one who hikes or even just a bird lover like my self. My kids have gotten me other Bird books by the Audubon for the regions and they are great as well
4,book review,"There is a kid named Cody Michaels and he got home from school and he checked the mail. He found a letter to him and it was a valitine and he told his best friend Chip to help him find out who his secret admirer is. So he thought his new name should be Double-o-Cupid. Instead of going to recess he went and searched everybody's desk to see who had a purple pen or to see who dotted their eyes with a heart. But then when he searched the last desk, which was P.J.'s, and to see it so he slipped it into P.J.'s desk. So then later on that day she pulled the Valentine out on accident and read it and said, ""Eww,"" in front of the whole class and she passed the card around to everybody. Then she gave it back to Cody. Then he found out that his mom was having a friend come down from India, who's name is Sunda, and he is a special visitor to Cody's class. My opinion of this book was boring."
2,Cody's Secret Admire,"Cody's Secret AdmirerThe book was much more ""worn-looking"" than I had anticipated.---I could not use as a gift---Had purchased it for a Valentine gift for grandson and I could not do so in the condition it was in."
2,Cody's Secret Admirer,"One day Cody Michaels stoped at his mail box and finds a letter in the mail from a secret admirer. The letter was written in purple, the I's were dotted with hearts, and she really likes bees. Cody has a friend coming and she is bringing a suprise for him and he thinks he is getting married. Cody's class is having a valentines party and he is trying to find out who sent him the letter. he couldnt find out at the party so he just kept searching for who sent him the letter. His parents friends get thier so he thinks he is getting marrried cause they are bringing him a suprise. It turns out the suprise they are bringing him is a tortise. The letter was suposed to be sent to a kid named Michael Cody. The whole thing was a mistake."
5,Lovely Fragrance,"I first came upon this fragrance while staying at a 5 star hotel. So, it was great to purchase. The kit is a bit expensive but well worth it."
3,Battle of Attu Redux,This video was mostly about the elderly soldiers' recent return to visit the battlefield and their reminisces. I expected more information about the actual battle.
4,"Good, but could be better","I was really looking forward to this video, since my dad fought in the Battle of Attu.He never spoke about it, so like most Americans, I was clueless about what went on.The video was really interesting, but could have been a lot better with some tighter editing.They took 86 minutes to give about 45 min. worth of info.It would have been lots better if they interviewed several more people, not just two former soldiers.Nonetheless, there aren't many videos about Attu, so I would recommend it."
3,Average,"This album is definitely overrated. It's good, but not great. The vocals are definitely great, she sounds excellent. Some of the songs are excellent such as ""All I want for christmas is you"", ""O holy night"". But songs like ""Silent Night"" and ""Joy to the World"" are very weak. Also her rendition of ""Santa Claus is coming town"" is very childish. This is overall a very pop album, with no real depth and soul, except only on a few tracks. Overall it's good, but it's definitely overrated."
5,This album showcases Mariah's amazing voice,"This is by far the best Christmas album ever made. Her renditions of ""O Holy Night"" and ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" are stunning. It's the closest Mariah has come to doing a true gospel album. The album is so good, I listen to it all-year long...in the middle of summer! She sings these songs with such strength - the way they were meant to be. I am confident that even people who aren't huge Mariah Carey fans would make an exception for this album."
2,wrong parts,They sent me the wrong studs.... I had to call ARP to get the right two longer bolts for my app.
4,west's paralegal,"The book is very informative and easy to read although the authors describe old laws/rules in great detail, only to find out that the law has changed and everything that you read is void. Of course they describe the revisions but I found the old information a waste of my time and also annoying."
1,A weak imitation of Frank Frazetta,"If you are looking for skilled and original art of this nature, then I would suggest Spectrum Presents: Frank Frazetta: Rough Work. Hoffman's style is merely a crude caricature of the master's work. He would better serve himself as an artist by developing something original of his own. To do that, he would need to look at a broad spectrum of other artists and attempt to learn from them. It's doubtful that this will ever happen though. Hoffman, though a very minor figure in the fantasy art market, is known primarily as a malcontent who spends his time tearing down the work of others and spewing personal attacks against successful contemporary illustrators. It's unfortunate, because he has alienated the very people who could have helped him develop a successful career in the genre."
2,Okay,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He wanted some instruction, as he really enjoys drawing. After watching this video I asked him what he thought, he reluctantly told me that it wasn't that great. He is 14 years old. He said that the instructor talked a lot more than using practictal drawing exercises."
2,Not for Beginners,"I purchased this CD under the impression that it would be just right for a beginner like myself. What I learned was a lot of drawing jargon. This is not a step-by-step for beginners. The young lady does not demonstrate step-by-step (from fruitition to completion) but tells you more about drawing than showing you. It would have been better as an audio lesson. I am keeping it because after the CD I am now purchasing, I will better understand what she is trying to teach."
3,Came on time,The book came on time but the packaging was horrible. It was all torn and the book stuck to the inside by some sort of glue and ruined the book.
1,Worst movie In my 77 years.,"Reading the description of this movie, I had high hopes for it. After trying to watch it last night I decided to give a review. I realize we all have different tastes in movies. I rate it on the following. First , the use of four letter words was a little over used. The sex parts seemed just thrown in for shock effect and served no real purpose in the story ( If it had one)The film jumped from b&w to color and from old times to modern randomly through out. Very disconnected. More like a Sci-Fi than any other kind of film. I found myself fast forewarding to try and connect the parts in the story, but had no luck. It's a long movie ,so I wasted a evening trying to make some connection with it. The acting was poor and over done as was the gory parts. I decided there was no one I knew who would want to see this movie so opened the lid and cut the tape and threw it in the garbage because thats what it is, GARBAGE."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"This fuel line is easy to work, quality, and exactly what I needed to complete the install on my home boiler with a TigerLoop Ultra. In my application, this item is under vacuum rather than pressure, so your results may vary. I would not hesitate to buy it again."
2,Carving Tree Bark,"This book is for just beginning wood carvers. As an experenced wood carver, I found little of the instruction of use to me."
3,"Okay, but not great","This phone is okay, but not great, in that there's occasionally quite a bit of static and the sound of the phone going dead (but it does come back). Problem is, it's hard to tell whether this has something to do with the phoneline or the phone itself. On the other hand, I haven't had this problem with other phones (even other Uniden phones), so ...For the money (cheap as anything), it's a fairly good buy."
5,"Heaven has a new angel, our beloved Soraya is gone.","Soraya is and will always be one of the most talented Latin singers of our time. Grammy award winner and multi-talented singer/songwriter. She has lost her battle to cancer, but never lost her battle to live. In her short life she was a spokeswoman for early detection of breast cancer. She made it her life's goal to inform all women, especially hispanic women to have regular mammograms. For her life's work, her talent, and her many amazing songs, Soraya will forever live in the many lives she touched.This her first CD is one of her best. I highly recommend it. Especially the haunting last track Pueblito Viejo. A very melancoly song that transends you back in time, to a place where all was peace and harmony. A beautiful song, in a well balanced CD. Long live Soraya."
3,Just OK,"After some contact with the seller, I assured them that the color was not important. The flashlight was promptly sent. However, the batteries were quite weak. I had to put my own fresh ones in. This makes the price not much of a bargain."
2,No mention of CRUISE in this DVD,"My wife and I are taking a cruise to northern Europe this summer and thought this dvd might give us some good information. While this video does give a good overview to the sites of the cities, there is no mention of cruising. It would be nice to know where the ships dock, the best ways to get into town etc.The narrator's voice sounds a little like glenda, the good witch of the north. very annoying, like a woman reading a fairytale to a group of children."
4,Superficial but informative and nice to watch,"Now I know that Lew Wasserman was a very powerful and influential personality, that his sphere of influence surpassed the world of showbusiness. (According to this movie he practically created Ronald Reagan as a politician). But I still do not understand in what way he influenced society, which would be interesting to know - but which maybe is a subject too deep and complex for a filmed documentary. This movie is well made (great musical soundtrack) and certainly entertaining. Even in old age Mr Wasserman was an attractive and telegenic man - it almost seems a pity he only acted behind the set."
1,Size!,"I received my iron and it's only 2 1/4 inches. The box says 3"", am I missing something? How are the sizes of others?....have you measured it?"
3,I Wanna Play For You,"The only problem with this cd is that they left out the best song, ""All About"" from the same vinyl double album! What a disappointment."
2,save your money,"I bought this cd because I've been getting into Isaac Hayes' music lately. This album was cheap so I figured I'd give it a try. Mistake on my part. It was mostly cheesy disco stuff- not the smooth ""get your freak on"" style I was expecting. If you are a huge Hayes fan you might want this cd for your collection, but if you're the casual listener like I am, you're much better off buying the older Stax Records cd's."
4,The best from Isaac's 1977-82 Polydor albums.,"Isaac Hayes' 1977-82 Polydor recordings showcased him in two different personas: a balladeer par excellence and as a Disco giant. This compilation includes such hits as ""Don't Let Go"", ""Moonlight Lovin' (Menage a Trois)"", ""A Few More Kisses To Go"", ""Zeke The Freak"", the rare ""You Can't hold Your Woman"", ""It's All In the Game"", ""Out Of the ghetto"" and his stunning cover version of James Taylor's ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"". The CD booklet contains a very interesting essay about Isaac Hayes' Polydor sessions coupled with rare photos and discographical information which round out this package nicely. While the remastering quality could have been better this compilation nonetheless offers a decent overview of Isaac Hayes' Polydor recordings. Enjoy!"
4,A very nice label anthology,"This CD is a nice set of songs that perhaps signaled Isaac Hayes' passing from prominence as a soul singer. ""Moonlight Lovin'"" was a solid, uptempo piece that was a popular DJ favorite on jazz/R&B stations during the close of the '70s, and ""Don't Let Go"" was a mild hit for him but by this time, it was clear that his best years were behind him. Some other songs of note are ""Out of the Ghetto"", ""A Few More Kisses to Go"", ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"" and ""It's All in the Game"", the old Tommy Edwards hit. The CD is a nice swan song for the great soul man from Memphis who had a lot to do with putting the Stax sound on the American music map."
5,Great Television!,"I bought the entire Hope television collection - and love this snapshot of television history! Bob Hope's television specials ran for over 40 years - and are a terrific nostalgic look at the trends, politics, and stars of the times. Great clean humor to show kids so accustomed to today's fast paced and often disturbing television fare."
3,A little tight,The product is a little tight for the size range it was listed at however a larger size woyuld be too long. tough costume to wear on a cold Octobver night if using for trick or treating. No room to wear clothes underneath.
3,Not super,"This costume was not as durable as I had hoped. It's cute, but the material is very thin and rips easily... The 'S' on the chest is just a paper sticker that comes off without much help... It's okay if you only want to use it once or twice, but it won't hold up after repeated use..."
2,Beware of the sewing quailty,"Bought this, and was shipped super fast but the quality of the stitching was subpar for under 20 dollars the sticthes had to be reinforced the day he put it on and the following 6 days he wore it. Great price but bad workmenship."
2,"it is Ok, but not the greatest",The back only has one velcro at the top and leaves a big gap on the middle back. Would be great if they added another velcro to close the middle back
4,Superman Costume,"My son loved it. We had a week where he wore it all day, every day. It's not the greatest quality, but it works."
3,IS NOT the CLASSIC Costume,"I was disappointed, in that it was not the classic Red, Blue & Yellow colors but rather the new colors that are darker. Plus it has rhinestones on the ""S."""
4,Superman size small,"When we got this my son would not take it off. It is a thin, stretchy, not breathable, fabric so decent for nice weather but not the cold or heat.It is made like a typical cheap store made costume. Large opening in the back so need to wear a shirt under it. The elastic snapped in the left foot on the first day. Strings hanging all over. Pretty much what I expected. Only thing that I did not expect was the back of the belt to be all sticky. I understand that it helps hold it in place. I did not expect the sticky substance to transfer all over the place."
2,"Very bad quality, I doubt it will make it through Halloween","My son really likes his costume, since it arrived 2 days ago he's wanted to wear it non-stop. But it's really poorly made. Since we unpacked it the superman logo on the chest was coming off on one side, I had to glue it back on. And several seams are coming undone (from the very first day), so I have to keep sewing them back together. Last year we bought a Buzz Lightyear costume that's still in perfect shape except for some fading from washing and my son has worn it almost everyday for a year. I was hoping this Superman costume would hold up just as well, but I doubt it."
4,Bible on DVD:Alexander Scourby,"My mother, Margie Crews, and I are enjoying this very much. We have set aside a time each day and we are doing the 52 week reading. I love the way he pronounces each word. It is interesting and easy to follow. We use our own bible to follow along with him.Thanks for your productMarlene Redish"
3,Alexander Scourby KJV signature edition.,"This DVD is a great tool to use if you want to get familiar with scripture. You really feel part of the biblical story when Alexander Scourby is reading. As well as having the audio you have a complete visual of each page being read so that you can follow along. And the trivia section is a great way to test your biblical metal.Perhaps more exciting graphics would help to keep interest as even the most exciting read can be straining from time to time. Also I think that each line being read could be underlined to aid in following the reader. All in all this could be a great study tool, or just something great to have playing on your tv while working around the house."
5,Bible On DVD is fantastic,My husband had a Bible DVD but the narrator wasn't Alexander Scourby. Years ago we had it on cassette narrated by Scourby. I started looking on websites especially for this one item. I finally remembered Amazon has the best book collection. I looked there & found exactly what I wanted. We are happy with this Bible. The font is large enough to read across the room. It also has a second DVD with Bible games. We are retired & love to play the games after reading the Bible with Scourby.Thanks So Much Amazon.Mikle & Melba ChristieKJV Scourby Complete Bible Audio MP3 CDS: KJV Audio Bible
1,"Awful tale, full of inaccurate information - Don't waste your money!","If one reads the Book of Acts before viewing this DVD, you get a better idea of why one should not waste time on it. The Living Bible Collection DVD on Acts is far better. I regret the $2.00 I paid to buy it."
1,GREECE INSIGHT GUIDE,I ordered this book through amazon but it was shipped by another source. The book was not what was shown on the amazon site where it said it was a 2009 addition. The book that I received was a 10 year old edition.. I returned it.
4,English Public? General Beat?,"I found this CD to be the ghost of groups past. English Beat's album ""Special Beat Service"" comes to mind, with the reggae sounds and bouncy music. I had General Public's ""All The Rage"" tape and this does not sound like that style music. More funky is a good way to put it. Well, I liked both, and really liked English Beat, but they also try to convince you that this is a comeback album with at least 2 of their songs. Also, what is the deal with the photos? I couldn't decide whether they were trying to be nasty or not with the title combined with the photos. Well, anyway, you will enjoy the bouncy songs -if not, at least it isn't full price, and they are ok to exercise to."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I had heard that ""Magic Mike"" did not have much of a storyline, so I went into watching it with pretty low expectations. I was shocked that it did at least have some type of plot to follow and was not just two hours of make dancers. It was not a terrible movie, though I do not think it deserves 5 stars."
1,No good,Was wondering how this was only nine dollars. Too good to be true. You get what you pay for. Doesn't work.
3,If it wasn't for the hot half naked men.......,"It's not horrible, i'm not hard to please though. It was fine to watch, but really seeing the men was the real highlight and i'm not usually into that sort of thing. The acting wasn't bad either."
4,Channing Tatum anyone...? Yes Please!,"Not the greatest story line here but still a fun movie to watch. Plus, who doesn't want to see Channing Tatum strut his fine self...."
2,mediocre,Unable to get into the story--very poorly developed. Not enjoyable to watch--except for the guys! Sorry I wasted my time and money.
1,movie would not play,This movie would not play for more than 3 minutes straight. It kept stopping and starting and sometimes going back to the beginning. After about 15 minutes of it we shut it off and rented it at Redbox.
1,Misleading,I thought this was supposed to be about magicians. I really like me some magic tricks. This movie is dumb.
1,Terrible Movie!!!!!!!!!!,"I wanted so bad to like this movie but I have never seen a movie as bad as this one!! The characters weren't developed at all, you see one scene then it would stop and jump to something else and never continue with what happened before !! I can say the scene I liked was when Channing Tatum did his solo & that was it!! This movie left me sooo disappointed !! I heard they are trying to make a second one...PLEASE DON'T !!!!!!!!"
4,Hot,I really like Channing Tatum. I like Matthew McConaughey but he looked so old in this. Nice story with a moral.
3,Glad I didn't pay at the theatre for this.,"hot. but slow story, with a blah ending, wish there was more dancing, but it was good to finally see it."
1,Awful!!,Not a good movie at all!! Language drug use not what I expected at all!! Channing Tatum disappoints and the ending sucks.
2,Magic Mike - not much magic...,"I had high expectations and it fell flat pretty much from the beginning. Acting was poor, scenes were sloppy and not very believable. If you're looking for whatever, it's not there."
3,Terrific dancing,The professional dancers who played the male strippers were great. Their acts were very impressive and entertaining. The rest of this movie is entirely forgettable.
4,Entertaining,"Fun movie with all the right ""moves."" Enjoyed it. Very entertaining. And it was FREE. Got to watch it on my iPad.Thanks!"
2,Magic Mike,The acting was bad. I think the actors that played in this movie forgot how to act. Also the story line wasn't all that great.
3,Not enough dancing......,I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I watched it at home by myself. It's definitely a movie to go watch with a couple of girlfriend on the big screen.
4,"A real crazy, sexy romp","While not any great acting achievements were to be found here, it was fun and kept you drawn in, laughing and giggling all the way."
5,Loved it,This movie was so much fun to watch and Channing Tatum was terrific as the guy just trying to make a living and get enough money together to do what he really wanted.
4,kinda corny but still good!,"the acting is alright but the view isnt so bad. worth giving it a watch, not very in depth character development or anything but entertaining nonetheless."
1,don't waste your time or money on this horrible monstrosity,"this movie was the biggest waste of an hour. Don't get me wrong I looove me some sexy channing tatum but this movie was bad. it had a terrible plot, the girl in it had no personality what so ever, and the stripper scenes were like 2 minutes and then flipped to the next scene..waste of time seriously don't bother."
5,Great Chick Flic,I had to buy this movie even though I went to see it in the theatre. I was mesmerized by the flic. It was exactly what I expected.
1,The Worst,"My wife rented and watched this. She said it was the worst movie she had seen in years. She even said that his acting was so bad that ""I've lost respect for Matthew McConaughey"". Her words not mine."
3,Not a family movie,I liked it a lot. Especially the men dancing.I didn't realize it had to do with drugs though!But all in all good movie.
2,Not worth the hype,"The only thing about this movie that is any good whatsoever, is Channing Tatum dancing WITH his clothing on. Otherwise, a very boring waste of time!"
2,Nothing Magical About This Movie!,"We were tricked by a trailer of Channing Tatum dancing, but this movie was awful. I still watched it...but that's just because Channing is so great to look at, but apart from him the movie was awkward, out of sync and sleazy bad. It was filled with sadness and despair and if that was the moral, then great I got it! This is not a desired lifestyle and there is always someone trying to scam you, someone younger waiting to take your place, and we're not getting younger --- go it. I would have rated the movie higher if I was just rating Channing, but overall the movie stunk bad! It is not a movie I'd watch again - the dances are so few and brief in this movie and that's probably b/c outside of Channing, no one else could dance. It was not nearly as good as the trailers made it appear. I'm underwhelmed."
3,Not really as Magic as expected,"So, the bodies shown in the movie Magic Mike were, in all truth, pretty good. Too bad they spent so much time on the degredation of feelings, drugs, meaningless sex and booze ... just really glad i rented this and did not purchase it."
2,Barely worth watching,"The story line, acting and script writing was absolutely horrid. The only redemption was Tatum dancing...especially when he stepped it up a notch. 5 minutes of a movie isn't enough to purchase again"
3,Ok Mike!,"It was, okay. Tatum Channing was very easy to look at! It seem liked they were on a budget to make this movie."
3,It was OK,"I shake my head because this movie could have been much better. It was boring. The only really good parts were when Channing Tatum was stripping and naked.... which I can die happy now because of but I honestly wish they hadn't cast Matthew Mcconaughey, he wasn't right for this movie and is very unattractive, He should of kept his clothes ON. The girl who played Channing Tatum's love interest was not right for the role either, she wasn't who I pictured him. I wish Adam Rodriguez had a better part, he is a really good actor and very sexy. The thing that made the movie soooo boring was there was barely any music. Any successful movie needs good music and the only time there was any was during the dance scenes."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was entertaining, but mostly just because of the actors being half naked the whole time. Otherwise, the story was sorta boring and predictable. A good girls night movie with major eye candy, but seriously lacking substance."
2,Magic Mike,I was totally disappointed with this movie. Not at all how i thought it was gonna be. There wasn't much of a plot either.
2,Bad,"The guys were great when it came to the male review, but the storyline was horrible. It was very disappointing."
3,Should Be A 5...,"Any movie showing Channing Tatum nude & Matthew MacConaughey almost nude deserves a 5-Star rating. However, the storyline was titillating yet somewhat lame...even for a love story with hot, sexy dancers. I soooo wanted to love this movie, but came away feeling somewhat empty. I felt extremely uncomfortable with Matthew playing the sleazy part which he did so well that it did nothing to enhance the experience. Since I broke my own rule of never buying a DVD before watching first, I will be watching this again in hopes that I missed something major the first time. Still I have serious doubts that I'll be back to update this to a more positive review!!!"
2,Not worth it,"This film has some good actors with some hot bods, but the script is awful and the acting isn't much better. The dancing scenes are just okay. I've seen movies that were much sexier even though they showed a lot less skin. I wish I'd listened to what many of the other reviewers said and saved my five bucks."
2,Just not a good movie.,Even the stripping wasn't that great. It was definately a movie with no real content. Considering the actors in the movie the acting was terrible. Who do you blame? The actors? The director? The writers? The movie production company that thought this was a movie worth producing? Just plan horrible.
3,Just Okay,The movie was only ok. If you want to see hot bodies then it was excellent. Otherwise the movie could have been a lot better.
2,terrible,Yes it was highly entertaining to see half naked extremely gorgeous men dance. But definitly could do w/o the cursing...turn off... and the story wasn't anything special. I won't be watching it again.
2,Magic Mike not very magic,I was very disappointed with this film.There had been so much hype that I expected something better and was very disappointed. Mathew McConnell did a good performance but the story bordered on sleeze.
3,"Great movie, storyline lacking",Channing Tatum did a great job but the storyline wasn't very strong. The movie would've been better with different supporting actors.
3,Story is not great but the dancers are worth the eye candy,"I was so bored by the ""story"" but was entertained by the dancers........They are definitely eye candy and the only reason to see this movie. Glad I got it on a good sale......"
3,yeah...ok,it was ok...not really all that in my opinion. would not have paid for it if I had known...wait till it's free
1,Magic Mike,"I bought this movie with expectations of seeing Matt Boomer dance. This movie is a flop and I would not recommend it at all! Stay far, far away."
5,Perfect Transaction,This was a great purchase and at a great price. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Once again I find on Amazon what exactly what I'm looking for.
3,Eeeuuuuw,"Thirty-year-old construction worker becomes male stripper to make easy money. Soon, he and mentor approach a downgrade to dissolution. Slight drama, and somewhat off-putting, to say the least, unless you feel like ogling skimpily dressed beefcake guys--but it's ultimately an upbeat film."
4,Surprisingly Good,"This movie was not what I was expecting, it actually had a pretty good storyline. I enjoyed it and not just for the stripping!"
1,Awful,"this movie was just absolutely awful; the story line was ok but needed much improvement, the cast were cheesy; regret buying this one!"
2,Not a good choice,This movie had no direction and was very choppy. The acting was horrible. I gave it two stars for the dancing.
3,Not her style,"Movie was ok....I thought the plot was a bit weak and the Audio was less than enjoyable. My wife thought it was a bit ""Over the Top"" which surprised me. I streamed the movie and the resolution was more like an average quality DVD than HD."
4,fast shipment,this was a gift purchase. i have heard no complaints so this blu-ray must have been in good shape. cant wait to view it!
2,Magic Mike,Boring boring boring...sure the guys looked great but how long can that hold your attention? Could have used some more of a lot of things.
5,enjoyable movie,i enjoyed the movie. great for a girls night in with wine and cheese. light and enjoyabe . travelog of manliness
2,Very slow and no real plot,"I Rated it 2 stars because it was to to slow no real plot. It went from being construction workers jumping to strippers. And the girl that played the sister WOW AWFUL ACTRESS, she had no personality. The only parts that were good was seeing Channing & Matthew naked that was GREAT!!!! then the ending was really off left u wanting to know what happens when and if they get the club Miami."
1,not that good,I was really expecting a better story and more dancing. I was rather disapointed. I was actually expecting Chip & Dales but that did not happen.
2,Boo!,"I think they should have focused more on Mike's entrepreneur story. Dance scenes were cool, but too much. Silly movie because they didn't."
5,Great Movie,"I love this movie, love the extras the dvd has. I wish the movie had even more dance scenes, I could watch it for hours."
1,Meh...,"Ok, yes, I was expecting beefcake, but had hope that it would have at least a little bit of plot... dang it really didn't... Channing of course is yummy & a phenomenal dancer, but well, it wasn't worth the rental fee, I wish I had waited until it had gotten to RedBox... If you want something with almost no plot, and random connections, but cute boys, this is for you."
1,Not worth the time or money,Hot men do not make up for an extremely shallow plot and bad acting. Spend your time and money elsewhere...
2,Boring,"I was so excited to see this movie, until I actually watched it. I was not impressed with the movie at all, and not about not having enough nudity because that is not what I was looking for. I was just not liking the entire plot of the movie I really liked Channing Tatum in 21 Jump street and was expecting more."
1,Not worth the time unless you visually like hunky guys,"The movie lacked any real substance or comedy. If you like watching guys in great shape grinding on everything, you may like this film. Otherwise, there is really no entertainment value to be found."
1,"No extra features really, even on bluray...","Blah... trailer, movie, not much different than in theaters. I guess low budget means even much lower budget on the DVD/Bluray. Disappointing."
2,The trailer was the best part,"I expected a lot more from this movie. I expected to be entertained, turned on, or at least it should have given me something to laugh at but, the plot was very weak, and I'm not convinced the girls brother was ever a football player. It wasn't believable and the cinematography seemed very cheap. I could have made this movie by leaving a camera on the front of a stage and filming people hanging out after a long night of drinking.I wish I hadn't wasted by time."
2,Eye Candy,"That's how I defined it for my wife before we watched it, but there was actually a purpose to this flick. I liked it ok, but it was slow a bit too often. The rating comes from my wife, so I guess the eye candy (male strippers) wasn't enough at all."
1,Waste of time and $$,"The story is lame, very little dancing, too much bla, bla, lost interest in the movie, only two guys are good looking (Mat B and Channing the rest very ugly!!! :( Adults only (DO NOT recomend.)"
3,Alright,The movie was alright but definitely not great.The viewing quality was horrible. We got HD thinking that it would be better but it was not properly formatted for wide screen and the picture was not good. We have gotten other movies via Amazon Prime on our TV before and since and all others look great.
3,I was hoping for more,"I really was hoping for more special features, meaning that they could have put each of the actor's ""theme"" dance could have been included. What is included is fun and the movie is very enjoyable, I just wanted more."
2,No magic,"The dancing was real nice but the story was a little corny. Typical stripper story, a stripper, stripping until they can save money to do what they really want to do."
3,just ok,Not as great as all the fuss. I was more impressed with Channing's actual dancing than anything else.The acting was not good at all for such great actors
2,Not good for the fellas,I rented this movie in the company of some ladies and gents. The ladies were really interested in watching it however gents were not very interested. After some convincing that it was a male-friendly movie. The fellas budged.It was not at all entertaining to me. The acting was very poor. Poor story line. And lots of dudes dancing around half-naked.I would not recommend this movie to other men. Women seemed to like it though.
1,Poor Poor Poor!,This movie wasn't worth the hype! It is badly made. It reminded me of a late night crap movie with no plot. This could of been done so much better. With as many of good actors in it you would think that it would of been at least a descent movie to watch. Total waste of time. I expected better.
3,Lacking some magic in the storyline...,"I understand how so many women love this movie as Channing looks good. Unfortunately, the movie needed a stronger storyline. The movie was going along fine but I felt like the end lost a lot of steam. This will be fine if you need a mindless movie for a girls night."
2,CODY HORN MUST DIED,"It's a terrible movie for sure, Channing Tatum does ok, he looks AMAZING, but the movie is totally taken down by the lack of acting talent in Cody HOrn, who happens to be the DAUGHTER of WB chairman Alan Horn, talk about nepotism at it's worst, this girl couldn't get a walk on in a church play on her own, she sucks and takes the whole film down with her. WASTE OF TIME>"
2,Just personal preference,Thought this would be fairly light chippendale type movie. Underlying story was a little rough for what I was looking for.
4,Good entertainment!,Good movie. Good acting. Very enjoyable. What more do you want me to say. I enjoyed it. This is stupid to require a certain number of words. I said what I wanted to with the first 3 comments. Says it all..........
3,"Not the ""fun, hot, sexy"" movie it's promoted to be","Magic Mike had a lot of promise, but it does not deliver. Not much real dancing, just the same ""grab a girl from the audience and pull her legs around your waist,"" or ""throw her down on the stage and hover over her."" The story was just plain stupid and poorly written. The ""Dallas"" character came across as a real sleeze, too. No professional dancer behaves like this bunch did. All in all, it was just ""Showgirls"" with guys instead of semi-naked women. For me, it was a waste of money. If you just have to see it, rent it for a buck at a kiosk someplace, but don't buy it."
4,Surprising,Surprising story line - more than the standard 'chick flick'.Oh...lighten up guys! It was fun!I liked the Tampa setting too.
2,Seriously,"Was this movie supposed to be entertaining? It was not! However, if you like half naked vapid pretty boys, then by all means...see this movie."
5,Love Love Love It!!,Love this movie!! It makes you laugh. You get to look at hot guys. What more could you want? I would recommend this to women who want to have fun watching a movie.
4,My opinion,"The plot is stupid. But quite honestly I am paying to watch hot guys dance without driving to Vegas. Worth it. Yes the ploy is absolutely awful but like I said I wasn't watching for the plot. In fact I was first in line at my theater the first time I saw it. I went back a second time for my bachelorette party. Hot guys dancing, end of story."
2,Disturbing,"Thought the pre-views looking interesting so I took a chance. Story line weak, actors even worse. Waste of time and $."
2,Magic Mike,Tatum Channing did an awesome dancing but I found the movie vulgar. I was expecting something totally different. Probably will appeal to some people.
2,I was Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this film. The eye candy was fine but the story seemed disjointed. I think the weight loss on Matthew hurt rather than helped him. He could have held his own being himself. I was yawning after about 20 minutes but watched til the end. It didn't get any better.
3,Kinda weird/depressing,Love the cast but the whole movie was just a little off. I don't think they really developed the relationships as well as they could of. Mostly just all about ripping their clothes off haha
3,Not as great as the trailer indicated.,I really wanted to see this movie when I saw it advertised. They must have used the funniest parts in the trailer.
3,"Disappointing, occassionally entertaining",2 stars for acting and plot5 stars for great bodys and sexy dancingOverall was disappointed in the movie
2,the journalistic camera perspective was kinda interesting but...,"wow what a piece of s***- wife wanted to watch it as we were scanning through the offerings on Roku. I was willing to check it out - we couldn't agree on anything else so this was the sole choice.No real plot, the characters weren't terribly compelling, acting... well anyways, I cant get that 1 hr 55 mins back. Save yourself and pass this one by"
3,poor sound and lighting,Pretty superficial story of the life of a male dancer. The dance scenes actually got boring after a while. So so.
1,Terrible,"I bought this to give a friend for her birthday. She is in love with Joe Manganiello and I knew he was in it. Plus EW Magainze had given it a great review. I am sad to say, it was terrible."
2,disappointed,i expect alot more. The story line was crappy but i really want to see more of channing tatum .
3,I rate this a maybe see this in your lifetime!!,"I expected a little more from it, it is definitly a B rated movie. The plot was a little loose and there really is that much ""man dancing"". but even so it was a bareable movie."
2,Um.... really?,"Okay, so I know I'm probably going to be bashed to high-heaven for this review, and I know the storyline isn't exactly what is supposed to make you want to watch this movie, but seriously? It was so bad that at times the lack of a storyline and the complete and utter terribleness of the storyline overshadowed the dance routines. I gave this two stars (as opposed to one) because anything with a shirtless Channing Tatum is good... to an extent. Rent for fun with your girlfriends, but don't go into this expecting to be entertained in between the dance routines."
2,No true plot!,This movie was a bit of a waste of time. I did not find the plot worth it. It was very predictable
1,Not so good,The movie was not what I expected. I wish I didn't rent this movie. It wasn't entertaining and it showed a bad side of America. O
3,Not very original,Mildly entertaining. Did not like Matthew McConoughy in this movie. Should have waited until I could watch it on Netflix for free. Wasted $3.95
2,BLAGH!!!!,"If this isn't quite possibly the worse movie of the decade, it's a new low. Then again, I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be entertained. The actors themselves are accomplished, so I'm befuddled why any one of them would add this [insert word] to their established repertoire... Every one of them are buffed to the nines and yummy eye candy. Could be fun watching after a few bottoms' up's (no pun intended) or for bachelorette, dorm parties, etc. Matthew Matthew Matthew... so much talent..."
2,Mellow Yellow...,"I don't care if the yellow 'glow' is supposed to be arty farty...it gives you a headache. Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !"
1,Was not able to view!!!,After it was downloaded it would not open! Never got to watch the movie. Very dissapointed on my flight that I was not able to watch.
2,BAD..DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This is absolute crap. There is no story line, no love story, no ""i realized my mistakes and am changing my life story"". It's Matthew Mcconahey *sp?* looking chiseled but OLLLLLLLDDD and kinda weird, and Channing Tatum looking great. But really? You can get the EXACT same effect by google'ing the stars names with the tag ""shirtless"" and it would be a MILLION times better. CRAP!!"
2,What' with the annoying yellow tint?!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe I'm the only one who was bothered by the annoying yellow tint to the lighting throughout the entire movie! What's up with that? You buy a nice TV with great color, spend the extra to get the blu-ray version, and then have to watch a movie that is washed out with a yellow tint. Why would they do that?"
1,Extras NOT on DVD!!,"Anyone who buys the DVD is in for a disappointment. The deleted scenes, particularly Matt Bomer's Ken Doll strip sequence, is ONLY ON THE BLU RAY! It is nowhere to be found on the DVD. Don't waste your money on the dvd. I don't own and can't afford either a HD TV or a Blu Ray player. This was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Not all of us has a blu ray. Some of us can't afford one. Why would the powers that be market it this way? Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Blu ray has the Ken Doll sequence at all. At least not in it's entirety. THIS SUCKS!!!"
3,Magic Mike,Movie was okay. Mostly watchable because of Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey stripping. The other strippers weren't too bad to look at either.
2,Channing Tatum saves this awful movie,"First let me say, I watched this movie for the obvious reason, to see Channing Tatum! Aside from stripping, he's an amazing dancer, really impressive. That being said... there was no supporting acting going on. Channing and the lead woman had no chemistry, the acting was sub-par, at best. The story line was really weak, and some of the stripping scenes were actually cringe-worthy. Matthew McConohay is a greasy weasel, Tarzan is just plain gross, and the other men are such bad dancers who can't compete with Channing. Don't waste your money on buying a copy of this. Wait until it's in a dollar bin or a redbox."
4,Great movie!,This movie exceeded my expectations.. Not just a chick flick. You can see good dance moves that make you wonder if you could do them.. LOL but not like them!
1,movie rating,"NASTY,NASTY,INDECENT,VULGER,NASTY MOUTH,I WOULD NOT HAVEWATCHED IT IF I HAD KNOWN,MOVIES NEED TO BE FIXED SO YOUCAN MAKE A CHOICE IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE NASTY MOUTH.WORDS"
1,This Movie is the worst,This movie had no story and terrible acting was a great big bore. Do not waste your time or money !
2,Disappointed and Disgusted,"So love Matthew McConnaughey -can't believe he'd stoop so low. Sleezy, awful, no real story line.good actors, lousy story. It had nothing to contribute of any value."
3,Magic Mike lacks the magic,"Mediocre story and acting by some talented actors. The movie demonstrates how hard these actors work at keeping their bodies in tip top shape, but that's all."
2,Most Men Still Can't Dance,"Aside from the plot being incredibly juvenile, only one guy -the lead man, could really dance. The rest are obviously actors, not dancers. In trying to go for realistic, the plot became seedy and nearly obscene."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I thought there would be more dancing, but no. The plot was weak and a nothing of a story. I am glad I didn't pay to see this at the movie theatre."
2,The writers should feel bad,"This movie was bad and they should feel bad. The only good part was the sexy men, especially Alex pettyfer. Other than that it is just awful. No plot at all. Unfortunately the hotness of the cast does not make up for the lack of plot. If you want to see these guys shirtless, YouTube it."
3,Visually Stimulating,The men were nice to look at however the story line did not keep my attention. I liked the music.
3,guilty pleasure,"On a whim I decided to watch this film. Dancing is great but the language has too many ""f"" bombs."
2,Don't Get the DVD copy and expect the deleted scenes.,"I purchased the DVD copy, thinking I was getting the full length dance scenes. Except they arent there! What a joke. We dont own a Blu Ray player, so I didnt really want to get a combo pack. This is poor advertising.Can anybody tell me if, in the combo pack, both the DVD and Blu Ray have the dance scenes? There is no way im going to order the combo pack and then find out they are only on the Blu Ray and have another bad dvd."
2,Really Awful,"I expected this movie to be a bit silly, and it was, but the longer I watched, the less amused I was. The plotline is uninspired, the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is mediocre at best. These aren't characters, they're caricatures."
4,"Great Movie, Disappointing DVD","So I've already seen the movie in the theater and loved it. The only reason I'm writing this critique is because I bought the regular DVD version, and under the product description it says:Special Features:Deleted Dance ScenesBehind the Scenes with Magic MikeThe Moves of Magic MikeThe only special feature my DVD had was the Behind the Scenes part. I was really excited about seeing the deleted dance scenes, and it turns out I don't get to.Boo Amazon, Boo."
1,The most pointless exercise ever,"I saw this advertised and some women at work said they watched it and had a good laugh. OK so its cool today and I am off so I dedided to curl up on the sofa and have a girly afternoon. Good grief this was the dullest, most monotonous, dreary movie ever. The acting was sloppy the plot predictable. The whole thing was second rate and pointless. Talk about mis advertising - I feel like I got suckered into checking this out with the promise of light hearted fun, like an updated Full Monty. In Monty the characters were real and believable - this movie is so plastic and phoney. Horrible horrible horrible"
1,Bad acting. Don't bother seeing.,Horrible acting. I wouldn't bother seeing it. Not worth even a penny. Sorry. I was hoping to like it. :-(
4,Hot,received on time!Channing Tatum is a fabulous dancer and was fun to see some of my favorites in this movie!
4,Loved it!,The dance numbers are spectacular and the guys are hot. The story is a little weak and there are some boring moments but the dance numbers more then make up for it. All the guys are very talented and are really hot strippers. Highly recommended.
3,Dear Chatum....,Oh Chatum one of the hottest white boys that can dance... That's about all I cared to see from this movie.... It didn't hurt to see Matthew M. As well....
1,Disappointed,"I missed seeing this in the movie theater and wish I had as I wouldn't of ordered it. I was totally disappointed as the dancing, the story line, the whole movie itself made no sense. I didn't even know who the girl was that he supposedly gave up stripping for. If this was a true story, good luck as it had no substance. I would of given it a half star if that were available."
