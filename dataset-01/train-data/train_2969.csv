2,BORING!!!!!,"If you like playing a game for months and months and then find yourself only halfway through it, then this is the game for you. This game is very difficult and can get very boring. One down fall to it is that there isn't a first person view. The only time you use it is when you are aiming your weapon and then you move very slow. Also, the story line is very boring and doesn't keep you hooked at all. Another thing is that there is only one weapon in the entire game, which is a silenced pistol. You only start out with 40 bullets and you rarely find any ammo along the way. What really bugs me is that when I played it it took 5 or 6 shots to kill somebody and you don't have much ammo to begin with. If you are looking for an exciting espionage game I would recommend Metal Gear Solid 2 over Splinter Cell any day. If you are curious about playing Splinter Cell I would definitely recommend renting it before you waste your money on buying it."
2,OVER-RATED,"There are a few things this game does right, but one of the most important things it does wrong. The world that you are supposed to be immersed in is a failure. It's very robotic and way too simple. I guess the best way to put it is that it just feels fake. An example of a well done world is the game Fable. Now these 2 games are very different but my point is, when playing Fable, you kind of believe that this place could exist, if only in fantasy. But with Splinter Cell, this world could never exist, fantasy or no fantasy, because the overall execution is just plain crappy. I would look elsewhere if you're looking for a really good game."
5,Wonderful Stealth mode game,Its an awesome game with Amazing music and drama effects. Once you get into it you just start thinking like it.I was playing this game and my room mate entered without knocking.. In a spontaneous reaction I had my controller pointing to his head.. I was living those moments.. :-)
4,Fun but...........,"To start things off, Splinter Cell is great. The games is fun and the graphics are terrific! About being better than Metal Gear Solid 2. Well, it's different. I won't say that it's better than Metal Gear Solid 2, but it's not worst. Don't be confused. Both games revolve around not being seen, but MGS2 has... uhhh ""boss battles"" but doesn't use light and shadows the same way... The controls for Metal Gear Solid 2 are more responsive and tight... Anyway, if you like a little suspense and getting tense when you play a game, you'll love this... Every moment in the game, you are sneaking around and trying to stay in the dark, even when you have a gun. Though, people don't call back up and attack you with endless waves of soldiers like metal gear solid 2, Sam Fisher can only take a few shots before he's 86ed. If you like Metal Gear, you may or may not like this.. I don't know, but the game is fun and is at least a couple of rentals."
5,A Game that is actually on bar with HALO?,"Damn straight. Let's take a little exam.1. If you like being a silent, stealthy assasin, check here.2. If you like George Cloony, Check here.3. If you wear a sneak suit and pretend you are Solid Snake, check here.4. If you like video games, check here.5. If you don't like video games, than why the hell are you here?!?! But check here anyway 'cause this game is gonna change your mind.OK. Let's just get it over with quickly. Splinter Cell delivers just as much action and adventure as Metal Gear Solid and then some. Plus it has a killer story and a hero whom Solid Snake would ejoy sipping a beer and telling stories with. You get awsome weapons, cool Z gadgets (yes, that was a James Bond spinoff) and the best visuals ever created on any video game. Just rent this game and spare your time instead of listening to me praise this game for a few more minutes. It is truly a masterpiece."
4,slinter cell,"this game rocks!what i like:the graphics are ausomethe weapons and gadgetsthe training level is coolon the first level you can pick up glass bottlessmash themthe price is lowwhat i don'tlike:the camera viewson the first level when you get out of the police building,shoot the two guys in front of the house.in the house there is a code locked by a code.there should be a picture.ineract with it.it should slide and there is a computer.turn it on.it will tell you the code for the door.also,in the bathroom there is a medi kit."
4,beat metal gear solid,splinter cell is the best i would suggest any body that likes metal gear solid to buy this game.
4,Good but Hard,"This is definatly a good game worth the money the graphics are good so is the gameplay and controls are easy to learn, but some parts are really difficult I have had the game now for at least 4 months and I'm only on level 4 thers 9 levels in all most levels are long to. overall this is a very good game."
5,First Game of its Kind for Xbox,"This game has amazing graphics, controls, and it has a very deep story line. This game is believable from the story to the way you can slip in and out of darkness, and even if you don't typically like shooters, this is a must have game. Quite possibly oe of the greatest Xbox games so far."
3,SPLINTER CELL,"Splinter Cell is a pretty good game in allthere are great graphics.....tough bad guys that don't just go ""ughhhgghh"" and die, they actually run after you (not stay stable positioned).The guns are not very good because you only get the pistol to start out....pretty good aim though.Overall the game is not that bad, but rent it before you get it because you might not like it...depending on your game style."
5,Heck Ya!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS JUST AWSOME!!!!!! EXTREMELY REALISTIC. A GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS MILITARY GAMES. THERE ARE ONLY TWO DOWNFALLS TO THIS GAME. ONE IS THERE IS NO CHOICE OF WEAPONS, ALL YOU CAN USE IS A SILENCED PISTOL. THE OTHER IS IF YOU ARE TRIGGER HAPPY, THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL AT WHO YOU SHOOT. THERE ARE ENTIRE MISSIONS WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A GUN!!! SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING DELTA FORCE: TASK FORCE DAGGER WITH SPLINTER CELL SO YOU CAN JUST BLOW EVERYONE AWAY ON DELTA THEN GO TO THIS AND EXPERIENCE THE MORE REALISTIC U.S. SPECIAL FORCES."
2,"Good, but it's no Metal Gear","I guess I was expecting more action, and this game has little. It is very stealthy in its gameplay, but there is almost no action whatsoever. Go for Metal Gear."
2,SAVE YOURSELF... FOOL,WAY TOO UNREALISTIC. YOU READ ALL REVIEWS AND EVERYONE LOVES IT. THE CONTROL IS BAD AND THE GAME ISN'T MUCH FUN. IF YOU LIKE GOOD LOOKING GAMES AND NOTHING ELSE THIS IS YOUR GAME.
3,"Its Allright, I guess","Ok, I fell for all the hype on this game and plunked down the Half C-note for it. There are VERY few above average graphics, and the game as a whole is blah. I played for a few hours hoping to get to the heart of the game, but I never got into it. Xbox has some great games, but I don't think this one will become a legend."
3,Bland visuals make for a difficult and boring game.,"I love Tomy Clancy books as well as games. I was disappointed with Splinter Cell. There are defintely some cool features in this game like the use of shadows but it's been done before in other games. The game is very difficult but that's not what turned me off. I just got tired of it quickly, the graphics were not what I expected. The Xbox is supposed to great graphics but it's obviously not the case here. I'll be interested in seeing what happens with the PC version as well as the GC and PS2 versions that come out next year. I'd suggest waiting because it's possible they'll make revisions to the game based on the flaws in this version. This game does not live up to my standard and I don't think it will to any hard core fan. This game is a rental for sure but not worth a buy."
2,The demo is horrible. Very horrible.,"Cumbersome, awkward controls. Stiff, robotic and unnatural animation. Sub-par graphic design. It reminded me of a 3rd person version of the 1997 N64 game Goldeneye, more than anything else. I read a comment in 'The Official Xbox Magazine' in their review of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 2- Substance: ""It's good, but it's no Splinter Cell."" I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. They're acutally 100% correct, but not in the way they meant it. The demo made it painfully obvious that Splinter Cell isn't worthy to scrape the grime from under MGS's toenails. If you want to play a quality stealth/action game, skip this weak attempt and go for the King of the Genre, MGS."
4,A short but visually stunning game.,"I agree that the game certainly is visually stunning. The storyline is quite interesting, too. Initially, after hearing all the cool things that the main character could do (e.g. grab a person and use him as a shield, do a split, etc.) I was scared that the commands needed to carry them out would be difficult to remember and do. Surprisingly enuf, the commands were simple to remember and I became confortable with them very early in the game. The only problem I had with the game was that the challenges were comparably easy to figure out. Before I knew it, I was done with game. Definitely a rental."
4,best stealth game yet,"when it comes to stealth this game is like no other. It has beautiful graphics, pretty good AI, and good gadgets. The game keeps you glued to your seat until the very end. Full of twists and turns, this game only has one flaw:the AI. they are smart but they are also a bit dumb. you can sneak past some of them and they won't notice. Sometimes they shoot at walls when they can't see you but never run out of bullets. If the game is at a good price, i recommend buying the game. I garautee that this game is probably the best stealth game and its only rival is hitman 2 (see my review on that)"
3,buggy,the game play is fun if you like sneaking around and attempting the same level over and over. The graphics are fantastic and I do enjoy playing. The main thing that bothered me was that the game periodically freezes on me in the middle of a firefight. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem but it's annoying.
2,Not a game for those short on patience,"Amazing graphics and fantastic sound, but the gameplay is just too slow. I played this game for almost two days straight then never again. It's comparable to a million piece jigsaw puzzle... only with the voice of Michael Ironside to constantly plague you."
2,No fun at all.,"1)DO NOT run out of bullets, or you will spend hours trying to beat a level with your bare hands. 2)You cannot solve puzzles in any way other than the way designed by the programmers. 3)You cannot pick up your enemy's weapon. 3)You cannot open the door while you are carrying your enemy body. 4)You cannot open the door when you holding your enemy us a hostage. You must knock Your enemy down or kill him but after that your enemy became useless. So that's why I don't like this game. This game just a puzzle , thothing more."
5,Splinter Cell,"When I first played this game I was shocked. Just of how good a stealth game could actually be. Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies. Its really fun also, suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game. You only use two guns during the whole game, the pistol and the rifle that has attachments. Good stuff. All you need is that, and you can take out a whole building full of enemies. You have to crouch, and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you. A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released. I highly recommend this game. Great storyline, and the last level is hecka hard!"
3,Just didn't cut it for me,"Alright I like Tom Clancy games and I was expecting this one to be like Rainbow Six only more stealth. I was surprised at first but it's pleasent since the graphics are superb. The training is annoying though and if you decide you wanna start the game over you have to do the stupid training again, not cool.You Sam Fisher this guy whose in the NSA in a group called Third Echelon. You basically stealth around and kill people and gather intel. The game starts out and you'll get hooked then you'll get frustrated when you get to one of the very difficult parts where it doesn't tell you where to go. Then you'll end up bored after your done be frustrated and you'll put the game down and never play again.I gave it 3 out of 5 this one just didn't cut it for me."
5,THE GAME RULES,"Splinter Cell is 100% RTS and the gameplay is spectacular!! I'm only on the first level, and the AI puts up a good fight!! YOU WILL NOT PUT DOWN THIS GAME!! During the levels, you will be sneaking up on people and either knocking them out or giving them a good bullet in their head! THIS GAME IS SO FUN PERIOD!"
4,blows out metal gear solid,i played this game and it just got me hooked 5 hours strait non-stop.This game is 1 of the greatest games ever made.And if u want another game like this then go for rainbow six 3 cause it has the same graphics ingine and is online multi player.Theres also a second splinter cell and its co-operative online.ive played metal gear solid and trust me splinter cell wipes out mgs in the compotition.this game is very addictive u must get this and pre order rainbow six 3 for the exclusives.This is a must have game as well as rainbow six 3.splinter cell is way cool u can bust any light for total darkness and beat them in the head
5,Good Book,I like this book. It's an easy read and the dispersed quotes and philosophy make it a bit more enjoyable. It's pretty informative too.
3,QUestion,"I was wondering what were some of the techniques,etc. for developing ur senses and other stuff. I want to know more in depth what this book says before I buy it."
2,Utterly Disapointed,"This book was written in the format of a childrens book. The tips were useless, and it was all coupled with horrible, crudely drawn illustrations. The tips went something like, ""When walking along a wall with vertical lines, walk vertically. When walking along a wall with horizontal lines, crouch and walk."" This book was very basic, and even the chapters on histories night fighters weren't enjoyable.Oh yeah. This book is word for word (I kid you not) the same as ""Street Ninja"" by Dirk Skinner, which is also a very useless book. I don't know if Dirk used a psuedonym for this book, so that he could advertise in it or what, but avoid both of these books at all costs, unless you plan to star in a movie with three little kids and Mr. Miagi."
5,A lot of material covered,"This is one of my favorite technical manuals I own. There are very few books I have found that focus on actual sneaking around. Instead of being like a military manual, it shows methods that even a single operator could utilize. Also focused on historical night fighters and time-tested methods, including ninja and middle eastern assassins. I'll have to admit the illustrations aren't that great, but they are adequate enough to get the point across. Unlike other books, you can tell that this one does not ""hold back"" information that some people would disagree against others being allowed to learn."
5,If you only want to own one Strauss recording....,"....this is a good choice. I really enjoyed these interpretations of Strauss's waltzes, polkas, and overtures. They are very crisp and up-tempo, yet expressive. I believe these renditions are very faithful to the festive mood that the composer intended. The title track, the overture to Die Fledermaus, is perfect, in my opinion. This is a very enjoyable CD to listen to, a very high standard both musically and technically. If you're trying to sort out a Strauss CD containing many of his familiar compositions from the many that are available, this one is highly recommended."
1,This is depressing stuff.,"I am constantly amazed by the number of friends and apologists Barenboim has within the world of professional and amateur music critics.This is not a superlative performance of Scheherazade in any way whatsoever, and it is not helped by the poor sound --- which the Erato engineers has uniformly wheeled out for all of Barenboim's CSO series. Murky, recessed, echo-ey --- even the ancient Beecham recording surpasses this Erato disc for vividness and immediacy. Once you compare this weak performance alongside rivals like Mackerras', Kondrashin's, Beecham's, Karajan's, Haitink's, even Previn's, its severe shortcomings become embarassingly apparent."
1,"No Good, Bad. Don't waiste your money!!","This heater was trouble free for a few months. Then, all sorts of trouble. I would be careful with these ""on demand water heaters."" Electric may be better, I don't know. Although they, gas heaters, have been around in Europe for more than 30 years, models are less reliable in the U.S.."
4,"Lighter than ""Air""","Great relaxing music! Nothing like Luscious Jackson, which was what I was expecting. Comparisons to Cocteau Twins are made because of the way Vivian Trimble's gossamer voice carries off into the air, kind of like the feeling of lying on your back watching the clouds drift past. Stereolab are a closer reference point, both seem to be funky, genre-blending groups with a focus on light loungey space-age bachelor pad music (I know that description has been used to death, but its pretty spot on). There's even a track here sung in French, ""Est Ce Que Tru"". ""Roll The Dice"" is as close as to Luscious Jackson this duo gets, with Jill Cunnif stepping in for some backing voal duties. Elsewhere Kate Shellenbach lends a hand drumming on some tracks. This is truly sexy stuff. A pleasant cd that I didn't expect to like. If you loved Air's ""Moon Safari"" and were sorely disappointed with their last release, this is something to ease the pain."
3,don't get suckered,"I heard the track ""roll the dice"" which is a totally rocking tune- than I ran out and bought the cd. What a disappointment. None of the other tunes on the album come close to the spirit and intensity of that track. I know, I know, it's a mood album- but what nerve to have one great track so far removed from the rest of the album. Anyway, if your buying the album after hearing only ""roll the dice"" be warned- it's not what you think. It does make for nice bedtime or romance music..."
4,"great ""background"" music","It was a very intersting mix of styles with beautiful instrumental and lyrical solos. Its great if you're looking for some mellow, relaxing music while you let your mind wander."
5,Beautiful Pop melodies,"An eclectic combination of soothing harmonies with modern trance or ambient instrumentals layered beneath it all. This is a great relaxing disc or great for driving on a nice summer's day. It has a wonderful sound quality and really shines on a good home or car stereo. While it may short on socially redeeming subjects, the lyrics are interesting and do offer some insight into the world of the lyricist. Will this disc change the world? No, but then it may make a bad world somewhat more palatable. Enjoy!"
4,Very nice debut from this Stereolab-esque duo,"This self-titled debut is a pop sensible mix of mellow female vocals and neo-lounge grooves that are bound to make any fan of newer Stereolab (think Dots And Loops era) happy. And although Dusty Strings lacks the groundbreaking experimental feel of that group to whom they're most likely to be compared, they do a fine job making up for that lack with a well defined sound and great songwriting.If I have one major gripe it's with the band's marketing. The album cover is beyond bad, showcasing the two girls in a band photo that would probably make Celine Dion jealous. Couple that with the pretentious description on the back cover, and you're left with the kind of goofy major label garbage that's bound to keep potential fans from giving this work a chance.That said, I hope you can do like I did and just forget about the packaging. The music is worth it."
4,Pleasant surprise,"I have been searching for nighttime headphone music, stuff that I can read to and drift off to sleep. Most of the ambient music I have found ends up being too beat-heavy and not soulful enough. I heard ""Est-ce Que Tu"" on KCRW's ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" and decided to give this one a listen. Perfect for late night reading and dreamy meditation. This is not an pure moods type of album, but rather a nice mish-mash of folk, jazz vocals, moody instrumentals and groovy soul. The artists, however, are not much to look at and would have been better off not showing themselves so poorly posed--yikes!"
5,Timeless,Purchased this disc on recommendation while visiting a website. I received it and was blown away. Pretty complex and lavish work. Music doesn't get any better. A+
2,the definitive samson,This is a powerful performance-very dramatic-led by an assertive Robert Tear in the title role. The performance is ably complemented by the other stellar soloists. I prefer the lighter more agile Seraphim as performed by Felicity Lott. The orchestral playing has the heft needed for the drama which would not be provided by period instruments. This is the Samson to have.
3,Let the bright Seraphim...disappointing,"Having heard the great diva Dame Joan Sutherland sing ""Let the bright Seraphim"", the soprano here sound thin and simple. Buy Sutherland's cd ""The Art of the Prima Donna"", and get really to be dumbfounded by Sutherland's trumpet-like voice and perfect technique."
2,Not enough here for a whole book,"Lembcke's thesis is that despite popular belief, virtually no veterans were spit on by hippies in airports when they returned from Vietnam. Lembcke succeeds in showingthat spitting incidents must have been extremely rare, but obviously he can't prove what he really wants to, which is that they never happened to anyone.The supposed spitting became infamous because it clearly symbolized what happened to a great many vets after they'd been home for a while. Specifically, society ""spat on them"" by depreciating and ignoring them. Lembcke addresses this phenomenon, but by focusing on the sensational, if ultimately trivial, idea of literal spitting by a few angry, unbalanced individuals, the actual treatment of most Vietnam vets becomes something of an afterthought."
5,The Politics of Memory,"Starting, with Nixon and Agnew, the Right has used the image of Anti-War protesters spitting on Vietnam Veterans and the Peace Movement being hostile to returning veterans to delegitimize the Peace Movement and political activism, especially on college campuses.Lembcke proves that the popular perception of the Anti-War veteran being anti-soldier is historically inaccurate by noting that both Soldiers in Vietnam and Veterans from Vietnam and other wars played an important part in the Peace Movement. Veterans of World War II and Korea were involved in the movement against the Vietnam War as early as 1965 and several Vietnam Veterans such as Ron Kovic, John Kerry and Lembcke himself were prominent Anti-War activists.Lembcke helps to reclaim the history of the movement against the Vietnam War and thereby help current generations of peace activists to know the history of those who both veterans and non veterans who fought against previous wars."
2,Where is the entire show?,I hope all seasons (1965-1974) of this wonderful show will soon appear on dvd 'cause i'm sure i will not be the only one who would buy them. That was certainly good quality TV compared with the garbage we get to see today.
3,Spanish on the go,"This CD is excellent to listen to on long car rides. Sometimes the English speaker, ( who sounds like alot like Dave Madden ) can be a little hard to understand but overall it can be beneficial."
2,Very little updated information in this 6th Edition...,"Having read the 1988 edition recently and then ordering this 1999 edition, I was pretty disappointed to read the newest version and find practically no substantial differences being reported over an 11 year period."
2,Incredibly Annoying,"This CD did not live up to my Veggie Tales' expectations. It was not pleasant to listen to. Sadly it ended up in a white elephant gift exchange, where it will torment another family."
2,I got this for free. I wish I'd passed,"I loved Veggie Tales as a kid and, yes, as a teenager and even college student. So I don't know if I've just completely outgrown them by now, but this CD was a waste of time. You can recognize many of your favorite characters like usual (Larry the Cucumber, Bob the Tomato, Junior Asparagus, etc) and if your aim is just to hear those voices sing, then you'll be satisfied enough. Just don't hope for much more."
3,It's OK,"My child likes it, but I find voices to be annoying, so I cannot listen to more than a couple of songs at a time.I recommend you listen to the samples of the tracks from this album on Amazon before making a purchase."
5,Super fun Christmas album,"My two daughters LOVE this CD. They play it as often as we let them. The album is great to follow as a story or as individual songs. My girls' favorite song is Sizzle Boy. This is a great alternative to other, overplayed Christmas songs from the radio. I HIGHLY recommend this for kids of all ages. I would've paid full price for it had I known the enjoyment my girls were going to get from listening to these songs, but I didn't have to because it was a free download. AWESOME!!! Thanks Amazon."
5,The kids love it,"This was a downloaded purchase that the kids love. We all listened to it and I will admit it was a fun download to listen to. If you have kids that like Veggie Tales, they'll love it, and it's fun for the whole family!"
4,Great for the kids,"A little annoying, but great for sing a longs in the commute to work/school with the little ones. They sure get a kick out of it. If they are happy - I am happy."
5,haven't listened to it...,"but since it was FREE i might not ever listen to it and it will still be a good deal!!! hahaanyway, my daughter will probably love this, she loves Christmas and Veggietales and i cannot imagine any kid that likes either of those things NOT liking this. a digital download of Veggietales singing Christmas music."
3,Only need the polarizer,You likely won't need the UV filter. Doesn't do much for digital cameras like they did for manual slr's. The circular polarizer works well. Don't see any image problems with it.
4,"if you liked L.A.Confidential,you'll love this one","The cruel and bloody story of the restless fight between sergeant Hopkins and a psychotic women's killer,both,on their way,defenders of the same innocence.Dark and hopeless."
2,Not impressed,"After reading L.A. Confidential, my first Ellroy after attempting to read My Dark Places and the Black DahliaI felt a bit let down. At the halfway point am considering making this my last Ellroy."
3,Haven't Read It Yet,"Was drawn to the novel by its title. I suspect Ellroy, who is a contemporary, was awed by the title, as I was, from a very good Robert Mitchum western. Ellroy has a gift for elegantly contrived gore and disgust scenes. I salute him. I have the same facility but little opportunity to use it."
1,Awful!,"Truly one of the worst books that I've ever had the misfortune to read.Ellroy obviously knows nothing about firearms, automobiles, and, quite possibly, anything else to do with writing.Phew!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Nov 8th, 2012 Energy Elixir","I have used this product for years. Nature's Plus produces high quality products. These are great for energy and boosting the immune system. Smooth boost in energy, not harsh, no hangover or let down. Significant boost in male libido. Great for people who are on the run alot! I highly recommend this product!"
3,Trouble in Piano-dise,"First off, the cover wrap says 5 tracks, but it's only 4. Nineteen+ minutes. Second, we start the record with an upbeat number that to me is not reminiscent of what that cover wrap states when it compares this EP to This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, and Dead Can Dance. That leaves three songs and so far they're pretty good; but overall, my feeling, my fear, is that Glen and Piano Magic are slipping in the quality of the writing (okay, so you've got a great co-vocalist in Angele) and may not recover. It's like now they know what they're supposed to give us, the ""glacial pop"" everyone expects, including me. But somehow it's not what it used to be. Should they break new ice? Should they build warm campfires over the old? It's anybody's guess."
3,"Finding them, Keeping them","The concepts in the book are good. It is a bit ""dated,"" but there seems to be little out there that addresses the issue of losing members as this one does. I bought it knowing that it was dated, and have recommended it to others, because it has many good ideas that can help pastors and church leaders to address the issue of losing members as fast as they gain them."
1,The Light In The Prison Window: The Life Story of Hans Nielsen Hauge,Copyright 1921 (90 years old). Author rambles endlessly over 180 pages. Worst book I have tried to read.
4,Gateway Laptop Keyboard,"The keyboard was a great fit, but difficult to install. The screws were not the same as on the original keyboard, but it still fit well. It looks exactly like the original keyboard."
2,For the price not to bad. One cent is about right,What is the point of this minute size collection. On the CD itself it doesn't list what decade it might represent. It doesn't list the artists name neither.9 tracks tracks to show 10 years of growth? This is just a simple formula to get your money and give as little in the process as they can.Walk or runaway from this...
5,Wonderful novel!,"Wonderful novel! The intertwined stories kept me from putting the book down. My favorite characters were the artist who made scenes in boxes, and the working class millworker but the entire novel is full of surprises and thoroughly entertaining."
1,Didn't explore symbols; can't write--is NOT J. Winterson!,"Not half as good as it should have been. The comparison to Jeanette Winterson was based solely on the fantastical ideas and symbols she had going (angels, &c.) but had none of the prose that makes Winterson great! This was straight plot. Winterson's excellence is not only her fuzzy line between metaphor and reality, but that her prose is rich with metaphor, is so flowing and beautiful. This had no beauty; it was just hacked-out plot. There was so much symbolic potential, none of which was explored. I'm very disappointed. Also, the whole issue of lesbianism was treated rather oddly--it didn't add anything to the book--nor did it detract, but it seemed like just a gimmick."
5,Wonderful recording!,This is a great CD. Every piece is made up of perfection and great music. Definitely for the Trumpet players and classical listeners. Every time I listen to it I like it more than before!
2,weak book,The idea behind this book is very nice. However the text and the way it is driven is very poor. It looks more a book for self-treatment than a book to get knowledge as I thought. The Pros: It comes with nice pictures; it is also very clear and objective; easy to read. Cons: not deep in explanations; poor content; not really helpful at all.
2,There are better books for your money.,I like to find the good in all things so I will say something good about this book. This book takes a person new to networking and introduces it to them. It also tries to focus on what you need to pass the exam. I did not like the book. The information was presented with loads of mistakes from grammer to actual information. I used this book as one of the books to prepare me for my network plus test and found it a waste of money. It is better to get your information from as many sources as you can -just don't use this book. I also did not find the testing software that came with the book any help at all. None of the questions on the exam even remotely resemble the questions in the book. You find better value for money in books like networking complete for around 19.95. It is better to know all you can about networking in general than just the material to pass the test.
2,Kiss fifty bucks goodbye!,"I took the Net+ exam this morning, and used this book for prep. I cannot recall ONE question on the exam that remotely resembled anything in this book.The writing style is very uneven, with some sections being written at a fourth grade level, while others would take a college graduate several readings to be comprehensible.The text is full of errors, most of which are NOT included in the errata; UNIX is barely acknowledged (I had several unix questions on the exam). The most blatant error is the claim that the Network+ exam has a passing score of only 75%!I found the ExamCrams for MS Network Essentials, and TCP/IP to be more useful and relevant.Buy this book only if you want to kiss fifty bucks goodbye! Caveat emptor."
2,"Good, but not complete","Explanations are good, but not complete. All NOS information is on Windows NT. NetWare and UNIX are a part of the exam as well. Looks like the authors only knew NT. Buy this book if you want to know only NT."
1,"If I could give it a ZERO, I Would!","This will NOT prepare you for the Network+ exam. Don't take the chance, I dont know how the other people gave this book even 2 stars let alone 5!! Please don't get it. EVER! I wasted my money on it."
5,Buy it for the cd-rom video,"The two re-mixes are disappointing. All they can do is stare with respectful awe at the nine-minute original version. Can you blame them? Not really, but they are uninspired nevertheless. The two bonus tracks add another layer of lovely ambient noise to the superb `Sound of Water' album (their best yet). `Red Sitter,' in particular, is obliquely moving: driving the car to the airport in the rain while your lover stares out the window detached and separate; alone with his thoughts. The appearance of `Red Sitter' on the new b-sides collection `Interlude' would render this disc completely unneccesary save for the bonus CD-rom video of `How we used to live,' a series of beautiful evanescent images which dissolve into one another until Sarah Cracknell turns up and rocks the (empty) house. The video-film may be the only 'mix' here which does the song justice but its fabulousness makes the disc not only a worthwhile buy but ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for the true St. Etienne fan."
4,How they always live...,"The first single release from Saint Etienne from the new album. If you are already a fan, you will definitely enjoy this. Classic Saint Etienne, dreamy lazy sunny days feeling. The first track comes in at just under 10 minutes and is a wart song (grows on you). The extra two tracks are standard B sides. The mixes are a little disappointing but the last track is the video... which is great! Well worth it. If you are not a Saint Etienne fan, try one of their albums first (Good Humor or Foxbase Alpha is a good shot)."
5,Smell like a Southern Belle,"No tallow (animal fat), wonderful Southern Magnolia exotic floral scent, wrapped in a lovely paper wrapper. Put this in your drawer to store it and scent your sweaters or lingrie. Lovely in the guest bath. Makes a welcome gift."
3,A showcase CD,"After one piece it became clear that the very talented player was going through his paces to show what he could do. However, the music was dull and repetitive and after a while we just turned it off. Hope he later work has more character, since technique he clearly has in spades."
5,A book that challenges and inspires,"There is a lot of information in print about stress, and how much we need to manage it, and dire warnings about what will happen to us it we don't. But, what, exactly, does one DO! This book gives very simple, easy to follow daily practices that will change your life. Its that simple. I have practiced yoga and meditation in the Phoenix Rising style for five years now, and continue to learn about myself. I am more aware of my choices, my resistance to change, and, most important, moments of joy. I am less angry, and more grateful. This book is written with warmth and insight into our less than perfect humaness...Let it inspire you. Susan Sullivan"
3,"Too flattering, MUCH too superficial","I agree with other critical reviewers that the details of Google's success are missing.This includes how Froogle works, how the library scanning project is managed, how math plays a role, how spiders operate, whether the histories retained about individuals' searches can be subpoena'd, whether there IS a privacy concern about GMail's archives ...Prior comments are entirely correct that the author can find nothing Brin or Page ever did that was or went wrong. When Page sat down in a bowl of ""creme fraiche"" at NYSE, it was seen as a spoof of the grown-up world of business. When GMail privacy concerns arose unepectedly, the concerned libertarians are viewed as cynical anarchists rather than legitimate tech. critics.I did enjoy the story, though. I've been a fan for years (& years), and was interested to hear the company's story.The story remains worth the read, but the tone is entirely uncritical and less informative than we need."
3,A Google Biography,"This book chronicles the rise of Google - from the labs of Stanford University to the multi billion dollar behemoth it is today. The authors have written the book in a breezy way - you don't find much technical information nor do you learn anything private about the company. Although Google has given us some very good software and search, this book does hype up Google at every little opportunity. But it is still fascinating to read about some very intelligent people like Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and how they grew the company. As Google keeps growing and dominates more and more, it would be interesting to see the public reaction towards it. Will Google still be the people's darling or would it go the Microsoft way?"
2,"Superficial, inflated newspaper article","That pretty much sums up my opinion on this book. Perhaps the only couple of pages of value are appendix 1: 23 google search tips. You probably know some of them, but most likely not all. Damn, this still encourages you to at least take a look at it, doesn't it? Oh well, I did--foolish of me; time not that well spent."
5,Nice book,"It is not a book about the analysis of the Google, the comapany.It is a book about Google, the story. I would recommend an audio book version of this. Eventhough the duration is 10+ hours, you will enjoy this. As the title of the book suggests, the authors put the whole thing in a story book format, rather than an editorial format of Wallstreet journal.If you want the business perfect of the Google story then go for the book ""The search"""
2,Not the real Google story,"The byline of this book is ""inside the hottest business, media and technology success of our time."" The problem is that this book provides no ""inside"" look at all. The information provided by the authors might as well have been found through a Google search. There was nothing really new that has not been reported a thousand times in the media or obvious to anyone who follows Google. The work seemed a bit ambitious and proved in the end to be nothing more than a cheerleading rally for a company that doesn't need any help. I think there is still plenty of room for someone to write a real objective account of the rise and success of Google but it may be too soon. Wait another five years and either the stock will be trading at $500 a share or it will be another success story with a troubled ending. The real Google story is amazing but The Google Story was not."
2,"Not well written, but I couldn't put it down","Overall, this book was disappointing because it reads as if Mr. Vise is stringing quotes together to get a story. There is no real conclusions or insights and many details and facts that are conspiculously missing.However, it's addictive! I attribute this to the engaging story of Google more than the writing of the book, but nonetheless, I'm glad I read it so that I can compare it with the other Google book, Search."
1,...very disapointing,"There's not a lot to say about this book. The content is boring and empty. It offers no insights. It misses the single most important factor of Page and Brin's success. AND... the narrator doesn't help; his voice is not only banal and uninspiring - it just plain gets on your nerves! How anyone could choose such a narrator is beyond me! A good narrator can always help to sell even a weak story, but this guy just makes it so much worse. It was really a struggle to listen through it, and I couldn't wait to put it on eBay and sell it. Not only that, the whole thing just sounds like a (very poor) promotional blurb for Google. Disappointing is definitely an understatement. I wanted to give it NO stars - it is really that void of any value - but Amazon forced me to give it one. There are so many good things out there to read and/or listen to. This is not one of them!"
2,Too much like propaganda,"I'm fascinated by Google and closely monitor the various techno-goodies that it puts out for its loyal following. So naturally, I snapped up a copy of this at Borders. But I really found myself put off by Vise's adulation for Brin and Page. Maybe Vise really feels that way, but it made me almost wonder if Vise is planning to apply for a job in Google's public affairs department.Seriously, Google's rise to being the titan of search is well-worth being chronicled in a book or two. But I just don't think that Vise's book is terribly objective. The book would have had more credibility if it mentioned some of Google's warts (and those of its founders). Instead, Brin and Page come across as a couple of demigods, and something tells me that that is not true."
1,Truly awful,"I'll start by saying: this is the first book I've ever thrown out. This is truly the worst book I've ever read. What could be an interesting story is just gushing fanboy nonsense.It really does seem to have been researched by cutting and pasting Google press releases. I wish I could quote some of the gushing text, but I threw it out in disgust."
1,This Google Story is Boring,"While Google's story is fascinating, this book is a drag. The content of this book could have been condensed into an article. If you'd like to read a fascinating article about Google, I suggest this Web site: http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html. It's a fascinating read and you won't have to spend $20+ dollars on it."
4,Revenge of the nerds..,"Everyone knows that most Americans hate math.This is the story that tells the two main characters who love math, then got into computer science research, started the company, hired Eric Schmit, put Stanford President on its board, got venture $$$, developed the world's best search engine and made billions at 30s!As of today, the market cap is $123 bn, bigger than McDonald and GM combined, truly amazing! I highly recommend the reading of this page turner!"
3,"Mmmmm, Ok I s'pose","This book is OK but I must admit I haven't finished it yet. While some chapters are quite engaging and contain good informaton, there are some that seem to be thrown in for filler and are almost entirely unrelated to Google. There is no real inside dirt as the information has been gathered from sources other than Google and its founders. It's, as I said, OK.If I had my time over again I wouldn't buy the hardcover. Certainly not at the 30 odd Australian dollars I paid for it. Until something better comes along, it might be worth buying the paperback."
2,"interesting, but only superficially accurate","This book reads like a 306-page promotional brochure for Google's two founders. There is nothing even slightly resembling good journalism. It is simply a glowing, smiley, hindsighted look at a story that was spoon-fed to the author by various sources and which should have been covered more diligently and far more impartially."
2,Too much flattery,"If the authors cut down on the fats they have put in this book while telling the story about Google (more specifically, about its founders), the book will be one third the size, more readable and perahps even less expensive. It sounded like Brin and Page were superhumans throughout the book. I expect a thorough analysis of the mistakes made by google (and any organization I am reading about), which the authors failed to deliver.Overall, I was disappointed with the approach of someone writing about the most exciting internet phenonmenon without even interviewing the founders very well. Sounds like the book was written in a bit if haste."
2,Access but auto-generated,"This is perhaps a good book for people too busy to have followed Google's rise in the major newspapers and who care little about good writing. The author says he became captivated by Google relatively late (during their Dutch auction style stock offering). He does not make up for that inexperience.Amazingly, he or his assistant author, in the book make comparisons to Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine. That book, despite focusing on a defunct company of no names, remains a classic. This book to me mostly squanders an opportunity to reveal more about one of the best American success stories today.In this match of brand names, ingenuous Google seems to have topped the Washington Post (where the author and his researcher come from), and made the reporting team a bit too awed and docile and thus the story seem too much like auto-generated p.r."
3,An average book about a great business story,"Quite detailed story and insight on the google way and its unique approach to business and internet. That makes the 3/5 note, but the writer style is quite heavy, the book could have been much more compact, maybe because it targets a wide audience and not only geeks.The author is also quite ""Google-biased"", not much criticism inside the book, but reading it through, you feel like some critical view is missing, maybe because it has been reviewed by Google... But despite this, i recommend the book for anybody willing to know a bit more about Google and getting some insider stories."
2,Pravda-esque account,"I only made it to about page forty of this book - so apologies if it improved a lot after that point - but I couldn't read much further. This book was almost completely uncritical of Google and its founders. OK, so Google's impressive (why I bought the book in the first place), but it doesn't deserve the somewhat Pravda-esque treatment given here. The founders are undoubtedly interesting and successful people, but not as pure and perfect as this book suggests. This book is OK if you want to read about a fantastic success story; but look elsewhere if you want a fully rounded picture of this internet giant."
3,Interesting sections overshadowed by repetition and fluff,"As other reviews have mentioned, this book is full of repetitions that make it difficult to read at times. When the authors focus on specific events it gets interesting, but they then literally beat a dead horse by throwing in quotes that are basically saying the same thing over and over. The last chapter in genes and DNA was actually painful to read. The first two pages of the chapter were interesting, but the remainder of the chapter was like reading the same sentence over and over again. In addition, the founders of the company are made to look like angels and this fluff detracts from the books and makes it seem like a PR guide. Still, there were interesting parts, but there should have been at least 100 pages cut out."
4,The history of the most popular search engine,"How did two Stanford Ph.D. students create one of the world's most recognizable brands in just a few short years? This book profiles both the company and its founders, and provides insights into a company that has consistantly defied conventional wisdom on its way to unprecedented success. Beginning with a vision of a search engine that would provide users free, fast, and reliable access to all the information on the internet, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have build a loyal following of users. This book is filled with inside glimpses into the history of Google and the challenges is faced on its way to success, as well as its unique cooporate atmosphere and vision. A great book for anyone who wants to understand just how this unconventional company has become so successful in such a short time."
3,Not that great,"The writing style and pacing is terrible. I felt uncomfortable during the whole read. It amazes me that one of the authors is a pulitzer prize award winner and not a struggling college student.Other Problems:1. The authors repeat themselves many times. They frequently forget they wrote about something a few chapters back.2. It seems like they don't really uncover anything substantial that hasn't already been discussed in an online article.3. They bring up the challenges Google currently faces, but don't supply any kind of opinion on the matters. They also do not do a good job of obtaining others' opinions.If you want only one book about Google, save your money for ""The Search"" by John Battelle. While ""The Search"" doesn't focus exclusively on Google, it is a vastly superior book that covers just as much or more than ""The Google Story""."
3,Not a real inside story of Google,"On the cover it says ""Inside the hottest business, media..."". I was expecting an inside story of Google. Instead, it was just made of information from other books, the news, and interviews. This book does give you a good brief history of the company though. If you haven't been following Google the past couple of years and didn't read/watch the news, it would be a good book."
2,Minimum quality,"This reads like a long paper compiled by an earnest and industrious high-schooler for extra credit, and published knowing that for a little while longer it is enough for a book to put a white cover and a Google logo around a shallowly adequate corporate history that it would take the reader longer to piece together from scattered sources themselves. As storytelling, journalism, analysis or entertainment it is uniformly undistinguished, and it will be a toss-up whether it is rendered moot more quickly by other more thoughtful books or the simple passage of time."
3,"Very interesting story, but poor writing","As much as I found the story of Google fascinating, I was turned off by the style of the author, who instead of explaining the inner workings of key aspects of the google business model or search methodology, praises google for being a great search engine over and over. This over-praising tone wears you out and you start skipping paragraphs to find out the real reasons behind the company's success."
3,OK for what it is ...,"""The Google Story"" is a decent book if you are looking for a history of the historic company from an outside perspective. Many comments say that the author writes with a bit of favoritism, and I don't disagree one bit. However, the book does not intend to be anything else.The back cover proclaims ""extraordinary access to Google"", and it doesn't seem that way. The book offers a good history of the company and its challenges but does not go into much depth about any of them. When they won back business in London, how exactly did they do it? It seems that the light criticism of Google is written from the company's perspective.With that said, if you wish to become aware of how Google obtained their success, it's a good and informative light read."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","As a professional historian I was appalled by this book. I have a pretty generous sense of humor, but Shenkman's weak attempts at debunking popular conceptions and his ""breezy"" wit were too much. He propogates just as much bad history as he purports to correct, oversimplifying such complex subjects as Alexander's conquests and the fall of Rome, and his section on Judaism could easily be called anti-Semitic. It should come as no surprise that he skips over relgions that it's not okay to ridicule--only Jews and Christians are the butt of jokes, here. As another reviewer said, Shenkman seems to like hearing himself talk--so true. His narrative style reminds of me those self-important people you hear dominating restaurant conversation so often.If you really must have something historical to laugh at, check out The Lowbrow's Guide to History, which, at least, doesn't pretend to be telling the truth."
1,Mildly irritating at best,As he opened up the book with stating that there is no hard evidence that Achilles or Helen of Troy existed I winced a little. Apparently this guy cannot differentiate mythology from history. I tried to continue whilst rolling my eyes as he proudly announced that Cleopatra wasn't pretty. And finally I gave up on reading this book less than 50 pages into it as he goes on and on about how the Christians were solely responsible for thousands and thousands of deaths during the Crusades. *sigh* If you're going to rant about history make sure it's something worth writing about and that you're right. This one goes to the garbage can instead of the used book store.
1,Buy a real book about history - not this one.,"This book is mostly opinion and not real research. The author uses vaguge and misleading information, plus soft ""facts"" to debunk history and give credibility to his view. His well worn arguement is that ""people just don't know"", an oblique theory that because it is history we can never be sure. He is a dubiuous expert like Cliff the Postman from CHEERS - he always has something to say, even if it is not relevant or true."
2,Bad History,"Richard Schenkman admiots he doesn't know much about history. he says so throughout the book. ""I don't know if this is true..."" he writes at the beginning of nearly ten percent of the paragraphs in this slim volume, then tries to make some lame joke about the veracity of Cleopatra's looks or Catherine the Great's sexual proclivities.It seems to me that, if you plan to write a book exploding the myths of popular history, you might want to start out by establishing your credentials to enhance believability instead of shooting yourself in the foot.Most of the entries in this book are just a few pages, not enough to establish truth or lack thereof, but enough to provide lots of white space to enhance the thickness of the tome without bogging the reader down with content. To make matters worse, Schenkman writes in the worst Scholastic Book Club patronizing tone, which serves to put off the intelligent reader.Unless you've tapped out all other sources, I wouldn't bother with this book."
5,Not The Quartet--Still a Very Great Book,"This is an amazing read, full of even more of Durrell's singular insights on the ways of women and men. Both books should be required reading for every 20 year-old who wonders why some 35 year-olds can be so interesting. ""Avignon"" is even more impressive when one realizes how old the author was when he wrote it and how heroically he saw it through.Sandy McCall"
5,Great bowls!,These are very cute! They are well made and the colors are bright and shiny. The dog loves them too!
1,Leaked,First time using it leaked- not very effective if there is a leak. Not worth the money for a malfunction.
3,The only game in town.,"This is my second of these gallon size bags. The hanging hole (which is only a perforation in the rubber and not reinforced) of the first one broke after a year or so. While the hose of this kit works fine, in fact is extra long so you can trim it down if necessary, the rest of the parts are poor. The connector leaks pretty badly and the hole in the business end is too small. I have parts from previous kits that I use instead. With those, it's very usable and the large size is nice. If I had found another bag of this size, I would have seriously considered it instead though."
1,Leaking Enema Bag,"I was very excited to receive my 1 gallon enema bag. I had plans for this bag. I wanted to do many different types of enema, but this over priced 1 gallon bag was not worth it. The bag would not stop leaking. I had more liquid leaking out of the bag then liquid going in me. The nozzle is extremely slow. After 45 minutes of waiting for the bag to be empty, the bag was still 90% full. I took the nozzle out, and the liquid was slowly coming out. I got fed up and I just emptied the bag in the tube. This was a waste of my money. This goes to show me that high quality, over priced products are not worth it."
3,Needs a practice PSAT and more practice problems in general,"I bought this book in September, and I used it for about 3 weeks in preparation for the PSAT. I thought the book was well organized and covered the material well, but when I took the actual PSAT, I thought I did quite well on the verbal sections, but I stunk on the math sections! This book needs more and better practice problems, especially in math. Also, a practice PSAT should be put in the book. I was disappointed that this book didn't help me as much I expected it to."
5,"Minon, a character to remember","Chernin has such a wonderful and lurid character in Minon, a young, yet old-souled little girl. I loved how she wove her characters lives together in a natural and transfixing way. THe book is a treasure. Look for other EdgeWork publications on Amazon, they are a growing body of amazing work."
4,"A satisfying Missa, now in bargain release","This well-recorded Missa Solemnis gives us a chance to hear the CSO and its famed chorus in full cry. I wouldn't rank Barenboim's conducting with the great ones -- or even the nearly great -- because he's trying to channel the ghost of Furtwangler, indulging in irritating, arbitrary slow downs and speed ups. On the plus side, he has a good group of soloists, none of them big names except for Waltraud Meier, and two huge assets in the orchestra and chorus. In the late Eighties into the Nineties Barenboim tackled several of the big bow-wow choral masterpieces, and this is probably his most successful effort, along with an equally satisfying Verdi Requiem.Note: Be sure to look for the single-disc budget reissue on the Elatus label."
5,The best orchestra in America,The CSO never fails. A great recording well worth adding to anyone's collection. I wish the Chicago Symphony did more recordings. Most that I buy now were recorded years ago.
3,It's ok!,I thought the lighing should be brighter. You have run the train wide open with no lights on to see a glow!
5,WOMEN'S PRIVATE VOICES,"This collection of women's personal writings is a revelation. The editor has brilliant selected pages that speak to us forthrightly out of the past, giving us a treasury of insights into how women have lived and what they have felt. It was a thrilling experience to emerse myself in these private pages. I felt that I really learned something about the hearts of these women and shared life with them."
5,Traveling through time.,"When I want to have a nice little escape from my everyday life, this is my go-to book. I take my book and myself out to lunch at some pleasant cafe, let myself be waited on, sip my iced tea, and read one of these wonderful diaries . How I wish there were more compilations like this, to allow us to move through time into the hearts of other women! It's such a revelation to realize that some of the same thoughts I may be having in my present moments were shared by another woman 50 or 100 or 200 years ago. Just a lovely book. I always feel soothed and rested after my little escape."
2,Huge Disappointment,"This seems to be a collection of covers and alternate versions, with only a select few original recordings. Since when is Tiffany New Wave? She did a cover of Forever Young, so this qualifies her for this collection? For those of you that love New Wave, stay away from this set and go with the Living in Oblivion series or Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave series."
2,Not the original recording,"For example, In A Big Country is a live track. Some have additional instruments. Some tracks seem untouched, but this isn't what I thought I was getting."
1,Monster New Wave Misses,"If you're looking for the original recordings of songs with which most of us are familiar, stay far far away from this CD. Some of the songs are listed as having been recorded by someone other than the original artist, so I can't really complain about those songs. Tracks supposedly performed by the original artists though are just plain weird. Some sound as if they were tape recorded at live performances. Some I simply can't explain. Only a few songs sounded as I expected them to sound.If there had been some sort of disclaimer anywhere on the packaging (I bought it at an actual brick & mortar store), I would blame myself for getting fooled -- but nowhere on the packaging does it say that the original artists' recordings are anything but the original recordings."
3,Not What I Expected Either; But Has Some Merit,"Yeah, I was also misled into believing that this compilation was of original recordings; but it isn't all bad. Some of the alternate takes are ""interesting."" What really disappoints me is the lack of a track listing for the third CD, there is a great remake of She Wants Revenge's 'These Things' that I would love to know who did it; but all the listings simply say ""Monster New Wave Non-Stop Mix by DJ Eric Ill.""So, worth $5 used but don't pay $12 like I did for new."
1,Second rate covers and one song missing,"One song was mislabelled, most songs were really bad covers. All sounded like bootleg concert music. Disappointed."
1,Bad deal,I bought this on the promise of energy savings but I never saw it. There was no gas savings. The water was only marginally warm enough for a shower. It wasted a lot of water waiting for hot water to be made. After 4 years it quit working with no warrantee. The repair costs were estimated over $350. It is not worth it. The up front costs are high. Water is not hot. Maintenance and repair costs are high.One comment I have from reading the other reviews. It appears this might be a 5 star product in warmer climates but it is only a 1 star in cold climates. If you are in a cold climate where your cold water temperature is in the mid 30 to low 40 degree range then this water heater will not make anything more than warm water. If you are in the south and have warmer cold water and if you don't use much hot water then this might work for you.
1,this is heater is a joke!,"Hey,After many hours re routing water lines this finally was hooked up. The problem is that water does not get hot enough to shower in. I have all the settings turned to high, and still the water does not get warmer than luke warm. Even a faucet close to the heater, does not even get past luke warm. I guess it's back to a normal tank water heater that actually does the job. No wonder why this hasn't caught on in North America! Don't bother to buy!"
5,Awesome unit,I think most people are not reading the specifications if they are not satisfied. It only puts out so many gallons per a minute per the rate of rise. This means if you live in Alaska and your water is 33 degress it will only bring it up to luke warm.The only reason why the installations are expensive is because no one in America hardly knows how to do anything handy anymore. I installed mine for maybe $75. All I needed was some iron pipe for the gas and 25 foot of Zurn Pex water pipe.
5,"Great product, great price","I installed the Aquastar 125 about nine years ago, and it worked like a charm until about three months ago when the pilot light started going out once every day or so. I took out the heat exchanger and ran vinegar through the line and let it sit for an hour, then reinstalled the unit. It worked well for a few days, but now the problem is back. I need to use something stronger than vinegar.I don't fault Bosch, though. I turned off the water softener all summer, and that's probably when the scale started to build up.I don't know what the efficiency rating is on the 125, but the exhaust pipe gets very warm to the touch with the unit is running. I have two baths, so we have to be careful not to, say, run the dishwasher while someone is using the shower.I give it 5 stars because it does what it's supposed to do, for the price."
5,Update,"I've been waiting for over a decade for these albums to be available on CD. I agree. What about ""Run for your life""? Down here in The Producers hometown of Atlanta the word is they've got a greatest hits CD in the works which would hopefully include a bunch of ""Run"" tracks. I saw them in 1987 at UGA and its still one of the best shows I've seen. They still pop up every once in a while doing some shows here in Ga. About time!!!"
4,Message in a Bottle...,"wow, i thought i was the only person who ever heard of these guys... surprise, surprise. unlike most of these other folks, i saw these guys in massachusetts as a pre-teen on mtv (thank god my mom's boyfriend was one of the first cable households!). anyway, i saved up enough lunch money to get the first (and then the second album). i bopped around my bedroom like a freak to these songs! the good songs sound fanastic still (she-sheila, what's he got) but some of the other songs sound to my 30sumthin' ears to be b-grade police. BUT STILL... so glad to hear them again!"
4,Power loc track,"Power loc track is easy to use, but be careful not to lose the copper connectors and that the track fits snuggly together to avolid derailing your train. So far it has survived 9 months with our 5-year old grandson and a few minor a consolidations of copper connectors from one piece to another. If the user is a bit older I don't think there would be any problems at all."
3,Nothing new but still worth viewing,"Bridgette Wilson (AKA Mrs. Pete Sampras) stars as Jenny Clark, a woman with many problems. At a young age her parents died and we also learn she was abused by her foster parents. She becomes the Surrogate Mother to Mike and Naomi. My inital feeling was she just wanted the baby but it turns out something else is driving her to be Evil, perhaps it was a past dealing with Mike or Naomi?"
3,Pluses minuses,"Gas bill did go down. Takes a long time for the water to get to the second floor. Kids who want a tepid shower find that it cuts off if the flow is too low.Cannot be easily installed. Requires special stainless steel venting that runs about $20/foot just for parts (cannot use your old hot water heaters venting, hard to find people who will repair it. Requires annual inspection and preventive maintainance of parts (so the net saving may not be there (lower gas bill / higher maintainance cost). Electric powered (no electricity no hot water). Saves a lot of space. Make sure you read the instuction manual yourself to make sure it is put in correctly. If new construction I would get again but to fit it into an existing house is not easy. Installed cost can run $3,000"
4,John Bent grabs you,"John Bent, former policeman and ex convict comes out of prison and grabs the reader's imagination as a computer programmer who can't let go of his previous experience as a detective. He quickly becomes involved in investigating the deaths of his coworker and the man who preceded him in his current position. The plot moves along well, the character is well drawn, but the technical aspects of computer programming take up a bit too much of the book and might be confusing to the average reader. I am looking forward to the sequel because I like John Bent and want to get to know him better!"
5,Beautiful dreamer is a wonderful read.....,We bought this book for a reasearch project for my 9-year old. We both loved the book and the illustrations. He even drew the Leonardo pictured on the cover for his cover page. Very informative.
4,di vinci wins!,"nice, crisp review and fun with the most famous of inventors and artists. 8 yr old entranced by di vinci and this is one of several instructionally-pleasant reads."
1,The 1995 Genealogy Annual,"The book arrived promptly and in new condition. Unfortunately, it is so out-of-date and contains so little information as to be worthless to any researcher with a computer."
5,a simple yet useful product,"If you're like me and trying to find or a missing cable for the xbox 360 wired controller, you could've been out of luck without this product. I can only give this five stars because it works flawlessly and was shipped with good speed. A simple replacement for a lost cable, this can save you the hassle of having to buy a brand new wired controller. I highly recommend this product, and hope it will help you as much as me."
3,It's Pete,"I really love the voice on this guy. It takes a few listens to really enjoy the CD. 3 stars because it just never became a favorite. I recommend it for both Dispatch fans, and those looking for a fresh sound from a guy with a really rich and pleasing voice."
5,Pretty and Seasonal All in One!,"I bought this doll for my 5 year old for Christmas with the intention of keeping it in the box and bringing it out each year at Christmas time. Well, so much for that! As soon as she saw her, she loved her! I had purchased the Christmas Morning Barbie as well, wearing pajamas and holding a stuffed toy. This is the one she chose to put away.The Holiday Wishes Barbie is cute and dressed in such festive clothes. They are very well made too. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend."
4,Two Wild and Crazy Guys,"Hollywood, unfortunately, imposed a love story (of sorts) on an otherwise zany film escapade. Fortunately, it is not too serious, and lends itself to many comic devices. While not capturing the madness that abounded in the duo's Broadway smash hit, the film does reflect its stars' non-sequitorial views of life's linearity. Generally fast-paced, except for a couple of uninspiring musical numbers. ""Hellzapoppin"" is a very funny movie!The ""Laugh-In"" comedic style one viewer commented on is, in actuality, the oldest of vaudeville gimmicks...the ""blackout."" From a historical perspective, one of the most interesting devices in the film is the ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000""-esque scene where they are sitting around a movie screen and...well, buy the movie and see for yourself!"
3,Great Story.... shaky writing,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, the story was really captivating. Although I was really entertained by the story, I agree with many of the previous reviews that there were many egregious errors in the book, and I had a hard time getting through it without whipping out my trusty old pencil and making corrections in the margins..."
3,A Memoir About Eating Addiction and Recovery,"This is an interesting memoir of food addiction and how 12-step programs and spirituality were Ms. Bullitt-Jones hand-up to confront her ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) background. ACOA helped her to recognize her feelings of emptiness that triggered attempts to feed her empty sense of self with food.Coming from the privileged upper-class, she paints a cold, 'let things not be spoken about' air about her tight-lipped family. Though she shows compassion for, and attempts to understand her parents, I'm left with as many questions as she had, especially about her father.Any lover of memoirs and anyone interested in the dynamics of eating disorders will appreciate this book."
5,"Riveting story, important message","HOLY HUNGER is magnificent. I predict it will be both a huge commercial success and critically acclaimed. After reading it through in less than twenty four hours I've been recommending it to anyone who will listen. Margaret Bullitt-Jonas writes beautifully. Never preachy, her message is important, her story riveting."
4,Can't seem to get your attention...,"Dear amazon: is there some problem with this particular site? I have written a review twice on this book and I'm certain other women have written about it, too, because it's quite ""hot"" among people with eating disorders (legions of us!). But for some reason reviews have not been entered since last January. How come?My take, as I've written before, is that it's a poignant and wonderfully-written book but I can't understand how the author could name the recovery program she's in so blatantly since it's specifically drummed into our heads that we are always to remain ""anonymous"" in any twelve-step program, and that no one should publicize their participation in the program in order to make money from it. I'm just a little baffled about how the author could do this, and is that the reason you have not published further reviews of this book?"
2,Only slightly insightful,"I was very disappointed in this book. Although there were moments of insight offered by this author, for the most part I found myself growing impatient with the simplistic faith perspective that ran throughout. There are many more interesting memoirs to read on disordered eating -- ones that look at the problem from the spiritual side. I am thinking in particular of anything written by Geneen Roth. Then too, there is a whinney undertone to this book that is a little off putting as well. Not that the book is steeped in this, but every so often I felt my eyes roll."
1,"Not Exactly a Pioneer Type, This Poor Girl","Mark Twain said, ""Don't moan and complain and tell people about your troubles. Most of them don't care; and the rest of them will think you deserve them.""Didn't the author have any pioneer women among her ancestors? Does she, and other so-called 'food addicts', prize victimhood so much, that they will to go to these lengths to join that sorry band? How come it's always Someone Else's fault?For a much-needed corrective to this Recovery Industry nonsense, I recommend Wendy Kaminer's ""I'm Dysfunctional; You're Dysfunctional."""
5,Bravely and beautifully told.,"It angers me that a couple of smug and snippy reviewers may have prevented this beautiful story from getting to all the people it could help. In my own twelve-step struggle, Margaret Bullitt-Jonas has become a strong companion on the uphill climb."
5,"Deeply moving, personally relevant memoir.","What an extraordinary surprise to read this powerful, moving memoir! Far more than recounting just another tale of addiction, the author has given us a candid, emotionally electric insight into the nature of any dysfunctional family upbringing. She writes beautifully, revealing sometimes excruciating detail with great dignity. The story of her relationship with her father is one of the most poignant and wrenching father-daughter memoirs I have ever read. Not only did I find myself discovering elements of my own eating compulsions, but I found myself reflecting--not always comfortably--on my own childhood as well as my role as a father. The book is valuable for anyone seeking deeper insight into their own life struggles, for it is finally about the lifelong work of growing more loving, wiser, more open to the Mystery that holds us all. A terrific read!"
5,Holy Hunger: A Review,"When first reading this book I couldn't help but wonder how the author managed to grow up in my house and I didn't notice her! Any Adult Child of an Alcoholic will find this book riveting and very personal. Her journey through her addiction to food, facing herself and growing is gripping. She avoids many of the ""buzz words"" that one often finds in self-help literature. While she uses many of the OA jargon, it's in the context of talking about OA. I admire the author's courage in opening up about her family, her problems and her road to recovery. A must read."
5,"An intimate, honest memoir","Holy Hunger is an intimate, honest and balanced story of one woman's brave journey out of addiction and into grace. Her desire to confront her family's troubled legacies, and her movement beyond that makes this book far more than any kind of ""dysfunctional family memoir."" Her portrait of her (very much alive) mother is particularly moving and redemptive."
4,Important book!,"This book has a number of important strengths. The author courageously shared insights about her eating disorder and experiences in twelve-step programs. I admired the richness of the language she used and the images she invoked. And, most essentially, she made plain the connection between hunger for our culture's quick fixes and hunger for God. Yes, some of the incidents she recounted made me uncomfortable, made me want to put the book down and run for the nearest distraction. But that may have been the point! My only complaint was that sometimes I wanted to shout at her, ""Margaret, stop telling me so much about your mother's life and tell me some more about yours!"" or, ""How could you value that selfish, vicious, controlling father above all others?"""
3,Don't bother with preview,"The preview is only the table ofcontents, praise for the book, and all the up-front stuff. Not one bit of the book itself. Very frustrating."
2,Waste of Money,"This book is mildly entertaining, but that is about it. The authors spent more than 300 pages to say: ""Exercise hard a lot."" One author tells us funny stories about what a great skier he is (which is the mildly entertaining part). The other gives us obligatory medical info we really don't care about. Neither one of them were motivating to me.The book is supposed to be geared toward women, but doesn't address the physical or psychological issues we have that makes starting an exercise program difficult for us.The authors claim the book is not an exercise manual, which is true. Unfortunately, there is no substance to the book at all."
4,Good,"My mom was pleased with this birthday gift, and thats worth the selection, and thats that that forever and ever"
2,Lots of exercise!,"To get full benefit from this book, the authors insist that one exercise 60 minutes a day! There seems to be little room for compromise. That goal seems impossible for me right now, despite all the reasons why 60 minutes of exercise is critical. Therefore, I was put-off by the book. I did like the mantra of the ""nutrition/dieting"" section, which is ""Don't eat crap!"" That is easy for me to remember! The writing of the book is easy to follow; each chapter alternates between the expert and the guy-just-trying with each giving great candid reasons for following the book's philosophy of simply being healthy. Yet, once again, be forewarned: expect to exercise six days a week!"
2,Younger Next Year?,"The bottom line of this book is that we will live longer with proper diet, exercise, and attitude. But we could learn that lesson with sooooooo much less technical overkill, excess wordiness, and the authors talking about themselves most of the book The exercise suggestions - climb a mountain, swim the ocean, bike across the country - are waaaaay over the top for most of us.The book is motivating but unnecessarily wordy just to say ""eat right, exercise, and have a good attitude."" Just my opinion."
1,disappointed,"Save yourself a lot of money, the main message of this book is exercise hard 6 days a week and stop eating crap. That message is repeated/reworded throughout the entire book. You don't need to spend your money for someone to tell you something you already know. They strongly recommend a heart rate monitor to exercise at your optimum(only useful tip in entire book) and to do strength training. Again, I think we all know that strength training is very important. The authors do go into other things like how they believe we evolved from algae. They spend extensive time on this subject.Unfortunately we purchased both the version for women and men thinking there would be specific information in each one. They are not different except for the menopause chapter in the women's book, which does not contain any useful information.Please do not waste your money - just exercise and stop eating crap!!"
5,Changed My Life,There have been few books that have changed me as dramatically as Younger Next Year for Women did. The scientific explanations at a cellular level of why we must exercise for the rest of our lives are powerful. There is sobering evidence balanced by wit and humor interwoven throughout the book with practical ideas on how to implement this lifestyle change. This is a book that should be read by everyone but especially by those who want quality of life.
4,Younger Next Year For Women,I recently drove to Albuquerque from Las Vegas Nevada. I listened to the Younger Next Year for Women on my CD player on the trip. By the time I arrived I was so excited about all I had heard that I about drove my friend crazy telling him. He listened to most of the CDs over the next week. We are both sticking to the program and I have lost 8 pounds as a side benifit of the program. I purchased a bike and joined a gym. I feel better and sexier than ever in my life and all because of this book. Thank you Chris Crowley I am recommending this book to anyone who will listen. Pat 53 yrs young.
4,Younger Next Year for Women,"Inspirational, motivational, practical and down to earth. Conversational style. Great read for those over 50 who want to live a better life!"
2,I wish I liked it more than I did,"I love the idea behind this book, and the simple philosophy of ""we either grow or decay"" has been motivational for me. But I am 34 years old and this book is really directed toward 50 & 60-something readers. I'm doing my best to look past that and apply the knowledge, but it has been tough."
4,"Exercise, exercise and more excersize","Exercise comprises 3 of the 7 rules promoted by Dr. Lodge. Interestingly the other 4 rules involve common sense and involvement. Moral of the story and our lives is to move, use your head, care about things, get involved and commitment. This book works as a good companion to Michael Pollan and Gary Taube's books on food, nutrition and eating."
5,Great Purchase,The book arrived much faster than expected. Very entertaining and informative. It reminds us about what we need to do to maintain health and wellness as we age.
4,Younger Next Year for Women...,This is a well written book that details it's subject very well and includes many specific action steps to follow. I recommend this book.
2,Should have stuck with the first book,"I think I understand what they were trying to do with the ""woman's edition"" ... But I think Chris and Harry should have let it rest. I did not find this book as entertaining or compelling as the first one."
5,Younger Next Year,Great book to motivate even the staunchest couch potato. Become a believer in daily exercise and it will pay off. I am considering buying a copy for each of my friends.
1,Would like a refund,I agree with all the negative comments about this book. I love reading motivational books but this one left me wanting a refund. I didn't learn anything new and was annoyed rather than motivated.
4,YOUNGER NEXT YEAR FOR PEOPLE,"Much of the exercise part of the book is helpful. How much exercise is optimal in fostering longevity is an open topic. Eating LESS is NOT.The earlier YOUNGER NEXT YEAR is merely a shortened watered down version of YOUNGER NEXT YEAR FOR WOMEN. 99% of ""for Women"" applies to both sexes. Some of the nutrition stuff is NOT up to date with modern research. The off-handed criticism of ""carbs"" is silly at best and harmful at worst. It is VERY irritating to see this pop nutrition anti-carb mythology recycled with ongong abandon. Being against JUNK carbs certainly is OK. DUH. The authors seem to give dairy a pass. No discussion of Casine and cancer is evident. For CURRENT SCIENCE everyone should study The China Study. This also exposes how the USDA is in bed with Big Meat and Dairy.The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health"
1,really irritating,"I found this book annoying, boring, and wordy. It contains very little actual information about aging, exercise, or anything else, and the information that it does contain is nothing that most people don't already know anyway. Basically, it is one big motivational speech that promotes exercising for women, but the male author is patronizing, condascending, and sexist. He spends a lot of time convincing the reader that exercise is actually good for women and that it's OK for women to lift weights. He seems to assume that most women are reluctant to exercise and ignorant about exercise. For example, he says that women should join a gym instead of exercising on their own so that they don't hurt themselves and are sure to stick with the program. As a woman who has exercised consistently on my own for over 20 years (including a marathon and a triathlon) I found it insulting to say the least."
3,Good Motivator but Not Much New. . .,"Good, sound, trustworthy and effective information about living healthy at any age. Most of it repeats what has been written before by many other experts. It could have been said as well (or better)in half the number of pages.The inspiration and motivation it provided was most valuable for me.Maybe Chris Crowley wrote in ""regular guy"" style to enhance his advise, and impact the importance of it to the reader? I had to plow through too many of his family-and-friends anecdotes, golf-course guy talk and outdated musings to get to the core of the good advise I bought the book for - which he did deliver.Henry Lodge's contribution was a much easier read. Usable and solid information, but more directly to his point.I found ""YOU: The Owner's Manual"" much more useful and applicable."
5,Younger next year Life Changing,This is a must read or audio book for every woman over the age of 40. The audio book is great. I have listened to the entire book. Try to live by it and feel greater than I have in 25 years. The entire book gives you valid reasons not hype crap about what you need to do to live a healthy life. Entertaining also laughed so hard a few times that I had tears running down my face. JUST GREAT!
2,Skip the parts by Chris Crowley,"Dr. Henry S. Lodge makes his points in a very convincing way. His advices are valid, solid and make sense. You just want to get up and do what he says because you believe his expertise.Chris Crowley parts of the book however are the let down that makes you want put the book away. Lets just say his parts of the book prove that no man should be writing a book titled 'how women can live sexy until 80 and beyond"". His man's point of view is obviously delusional plus all his testimonial writing how he remains athletic and fit despite his age all thanks to Henry's advice is blah blah blah, a yawn. Five stars for Dr. Henry S. Lodge parts of the book and zero star for Chris Crowley."
3,pretty good book,"While this isn't the best book out there on aging,it has some very interesting and valuable information on the positive effects of exercise.I was surprised that it contained alittle profanity,which should have been ommitted.It did nothing to enhance the book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,A friend suggested these books and I stupidly ordered them without checking them out. I received them and found that they are only pages of common sense. It feeds on people either with addictions or no self-discipline. It assumes that all people in their 60s and 70s have no health issues and can hike 100 miles -- they just need to decide to. It's all ridiculous dribble which is all in recycle now. I wasted my money for sure. Don't fall for it -- save your money.
2,Flawed Reasoning,"I really wanted to like this book and was off to a good start as I began reading, and enjoying the authors' styles and sense of humor. However I was unprepared for the surprise of learning that the principles in this book are grounded in evolution. I do not believe the human body is a result of millions of years of evolution. We are created in the image of the Almighty God. With that being said, I do agree with some of the conclusions reached in the book just not on the reasons why the authors reached those conclusions. The book did give me some things to consider and, overall, I am glad I read it."
4,Quality of book is great.,I received the book in excellent condition but unfortunately have not had time to read it to give an appropriate review. I have heard it is very good.
1,not so good,"I ordered this book under the assumption that it would have more info on hoe to look younger than info on losing weight, and how often we should excersize. The same theme ran throughtout the book only worded differently. I wasted my money on this one!"
1,An unusual reason why I hated this book,"What actually turned me off most about this book was the physician's blatant assumption that all of his readers buy into the theory (yep, it's a theory) of evolution. I am one who personally believes we were created by an Intelligent Designer and that we didn't originate from bacteria. The doctor-author founded SO much of his beginning material on the concept of evolution that I became disinterested in reading further. I want to take care of myself because of my worth as a person, not because I'm a mere biological product of evolution that has no eternal soul. I personally found his perspective depressing."
3,good if you like to read about cycling,"not up to this so have not used it, I walk everywhere with my dog,not able to cycle so I didnt get much out of it."
3,Long winded but if you are looking for a pep-talk..this could be it,"Fast approaching 50, I picked up this book a bit frightened about the aging process. Although it is largely common sense, Harry and Chris do provide some inspiring views of the aging process and how one can live the last third of their life with better physical fitness. Although it doesn't appear Dr. Harry's advice is backed up by any official scientific evidence, the concept of getting yourself moving earlier than later will gie you a much better out come in future years. If you are already and avid exercise person who eats well, move on to other books. I think this one is more for people who haven't really committed to a fit life style and need a wake up call. Best!"
5,as expected - great price,I got the book for a smokin' deal and the condition was as expected when it arrived. Excellent. Timely shipment. Would recommend the book and the seller.
1,Save Your Money!,"I was so disappointed with this book. Eat right, Exercise, rid yourself of relationships that drain you and make you unhappy, Exercise, create a supportive network of friends, Exercise, stay involved in activities. There I just told you what the entire book said, so save your money. I thought this book had a slightly sexist tone to it because it seemed that women were more defined by their relationships to others especially a spouse. A woman is not defined by who she marries, if she even chooses to marry, or by whether or not she has children. It seemed at times that the author was telling a woman to make sure her spouse was well taken care of so that she could take care of herself too. This book offered no new insights.Younger Next Year for Women: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy'Until You're 80 and Beyond"
2,"This could have been a ""short story"" instead of a book","There were so many redundancies in this book. It reminds me of when I was a student and had to write a lengthy paper for a class - I would state and restate the concepts to stretch out the length (says a lot about me as a student, eh?). There's so much unnecessary stuff in this book that I've taken to just skimming it. And, though I'm sure they didn't intend this, I believe the writing also comes across at times as sexist and ageist."
5,Jumpstart to health,"This book set me on the ""good path"" for my health. It is very clear about how the body is affected by exercise, nutrition, and mental attitude, while at the same time offering a humorous take on how we kid ourselves. I immediately noticed an improvement in how I was feeling a week into implementing it. I am sure I will read it again and again, at least parts of it, to help motivate me to continue ""the program."""
5,Great wake up call!,"This is a great book that gets your attention. Though I never really thought I needed to know all the medical ""stuff"" they tell you about in this book, it sure helps me understand more about how I can live healthier for the rest of my life and it makes sense. I have chronic back pain and am looking forward to seeing if I can get relief by excercising and staying in shape."
1,"""Old dear,"" indeed!","I hate to go against the trend of those who loved this book, but I loathed it. From remarks such as, ""Maybe you're a fat piggy..."" or ""Your skin and hair will get weird, but too bad"", I thought the male writers of this book had a very condescending attitude toward women. It seemed they had little understanding of women's needs and desires. All I learned from the doctor's ""scientific"" theories in the book was ""use it or lose it."" If you already understand that eating right and exercising helps you stay young, then don't waste your money on this book."
1,TMI,"This book needed a good editor. Lots of great information (mostly provided by Henry Lodge) but you have to weed through story after story from Chris Crowley that didn't seem valuable. I know they're meant to motivate and inspire but instead seemed self-indulgent and irrelevant. Most take place in ski resorts and locales that few of us can afford to visit. Adding insult to injury is the pompous and condescending reading style of the ""voice"" of Crowley on the CD version. Who is he reading this to? There have to be books out there that are a bit more to the point than this one."
1,Duplicate Pubication,"If you've read Younger Next Year you need not read Younger Next Year For Women. They are, word for word, nearly the same book. I was hoping for some additional information... but there is none. Same anecdotes, same advice, same science explanations word-for-word. Younger Next Year is awesome. Younger Next Year for Women is a phoned in rip off."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Here's the short version: Exercise 6 days a week, join a gym, hire a trainer. End of book! I was expecting various exercise plans, healthy eating suggestions, other ideas of things to do such as mental exercises, journaling, playing games, etc...things that have shown to be good for helping your brain stay alert as well as your body. Unfortunately, these guys wrote almost 400 pages of redundant, regurgitated babble over and over, ad nausium! The 71 yr. old guy skis...he said that in every other chapter. That's it. So save your money. Spend it on a good trainer."
5,Younger Next Year for Women,This is a great read for women of all ages. I'm giving this book to all my friends.
2,I bought both the book and the CD. The book is better.,"The copy of the CD that I ordered had tracks that were scratched and impossible to listen without great difficulty. I know that this book is supposed to get you going, but the CD readers were not as inspirational as I was hoping.There were two readers and one was better than the other. It just seemed that the reader could have been more effective in presenting the material. It was downright awful."
3,Younger Next Year,"Younger Next Year for Women: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy'Until You're 80 and BeyondGood advice, but mostly common sense. I don't agree with all of the information, but I took what was right for me. Eat right.Don't drink too much--except water. And exrcise-six days a week is a bit much though.Interesting juxtaposition between advice from a professional (a doctor and a layman. The layman's writing was colorful and more fun to read."
3,Disappointing and little information,"1. Very little information in this book-- it could have been one third the size but it's filled with chatter and stories-- mostly about Chris. Interesting stories, okay, but I am not reading the book for stories.2. The book is based on the premise of evolution which is presented as fact. It's not fact.3. The book was also clearly written for men, and I wonder if they went back and added ""wo"" to every reference just to adapt the first book to women.4. Chris, in particuliar, uses four-letter words through the whole book. Maybe men don't mind, but I do. I do not need to read that language on every page.If I had known, I would have saved my money and bought a serious book about health and fitness."
2,OverRated,"I found the book to be a disappointment. Aside from the historical/biological analysis the premise is nothing new. Use it or lose it has been recoined ""Grow or Decay."" What the book really says is that we need to do aerobic exercise in combination with strength training. Period.I found Dr. Lodge's sections of the book to be quite good-useful. Chris Crowley's sections included comments that felt demeaning to women from implying that women were unlikely to work out hard enough to talking about how he liked to stare at women, with veiled references to sex. I got tired of his stories of trips to beaches, skiing and other exotic (and unaccessible locations for many of us) locations. Most women don't have the leisure time to spend several hours every day at a gym.I would have preferred to see a female expert involved in this book as it's always hard to hear men advising women how to deal with menopause, sexuality and other exclusively female matters."
1,Rehash of old stuff.,I found this book to not be worth my time. This book is just a rehash of old stuff and not particularly interesting..
2,"Totally obnoxious narrator -- ""animations"" are lame","The effeminate, grade-D narrator of this history lesson is enough for you to long for Ben Stein in Ferris Bueller's Day Off -- and it is a decidedly cursory look at the Civil War battles-- nothing more than you would see in any documentary. But where this program truly fails is in the ""animation"" department. You could get the same info. by looking at any map of one of these battles. And if you readf a book, you wouldn;t have to listen to the annoying narrator! Not recommended."
4,Has anyone at Amazon proofread this?,"I very much enjoy Jane Haddam's books, including this one. But the Kindle edition has so many typographical errors that it could pass for Dutch (or secret code) in some places. It is quite possible to follow, since one can easily guess what the original text is meant to be, but one wonders how a reader could interpret around the same level of sloppiness in a text by, say, James Joyce......"
5,Small town hell,"I think this is the best of the Gregor Demarkian novels, all of which I love. The small town atmosphere, a requirement that everybody be the same and that anything different is just wrong, is brought out clearly. Reading it helps you understand where school shooters come from, as the in crowd harasses the outsider, with little or no objection (and sometimes active encouragement) by authority. Haddam's people are as real as your neighbors, and they're not all the same."
1,Couldn't even finish,"I gave this book a chance, but after a week I could only get through 140 pages. Nothing happened, and the female characters, waiting for Liz to arrive in town, were all the same and kept throwing up as they waited. It was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe it got better, maybe I should have kept going, but I finally grabbed something else off my shelf and immediately I was involved. That never happened with this awful book."
1,Somebody Else's Music,"Jane Haddam has been one of my favorite authors since her first series. I have read and re-read her books. This one I will never touch again! It is depressing and these people simply don't ring true to me. It is possible that I am simply too old. In my high school days, the level of bullying had not reached the height that it apparently has nowadays. Teachers and parents kept the bullying down to a low level, I guess. My gut reaction is that if you have known people like this in your life, I really pity you."
2,Pony really lost their edge,"I used to LOVE Pony shoes. I wore many pairs till their was no sole left so when I got these I was looking forward to seeing another awesome shoe. What I saw though was an ugly shoe instead. To be frank, the show just looks weird on your foot. It makes my foot look alot taller then it already is.But if you don't care about style and just about comfort I do have to say the shoe is pretty comfortable to stand and walk in and I can recommend it in that regard."
3,"Too Short, Too Predictable","This album has all the earmarks of a typical live record of that era that was made to meet a record company obligation. It has none of the originality of the band's classic live Deliverin album and features a smattering of tunes in more or less their original form. Poco fans would be better served to pick up The Last Roundup if they want to get a taste of the live performances of the ""fab four"" lineup of Cotton, Schmit, Young and Grantham.All that said, seven Poco tracks are better than none and there are no weak moments on this record. Despite this, I came away very unimpressed by this album. I give it three stars only because it is Poco and it is actually a very listenable, although not inspiring, record."
1,I got the wrong one,Now i have a very oily skin i searched for good moustrizers and found this one it says it is for normal to oily skin but what i got is for normal to dry skin!!!!!!!
3,No Classic,"Having just read ""Into Thin Air"" I was looking for another gripping true story. This book seemed to promise that, but sadly, it didn't deliver. While what the Baileys did was enormous and awe-inspiring, the story is really quite tepid. LOTS of pictures and drawings to flesh out the skimpy 192 pages. Redundant - day after day the same thing, sometimes told once by Maurice and a second time by Maralyn. I know it was a harrowing experience, I just wish I could have FELT it more"
3,Interesting,"For the songs we all know and love, it's a very complete collection. There's a ton of power ballad collections that include most of these songs, but always seem to miss a few! I am glad to see they included Lita Ford, and Great White too. Some of the tracks are not the best produced versions, so sample before you buy. But,it's a good compilation."
1,Disappointment,"I am sorry. I am very batty about forgetting things, but memory tricks are nothing to me."
1,Completely Revised?,"Out of date, nothing new. I was very disapointed in this book. The information is the same as are the photos as the first edition 20 years ago. There are too many other books on the subject to waste your time with this one."
5,Lost treasure,This book could be written in the last 10 years. The principles in the book are as applicable now as they were in the 20's and 30's. I think this should be required reading for every high school and college student.
4,Good for beginners,This book had lots of good starter information. It gave me a good foundation to really start planning for my first triathlon. The training routines were well divided into fitness levels. This is a good starter book to build a knowledge base on.
5,Exactly what I needed...,"I've found other triathlon training books to be either too detailed, or too simplistic. This book really covers a lot of necessary information in an easy to follow manner for the beginner or intermediate athlete."
2,Not bad but.....,"This book is OK but is certainly padded with a lot of irrelevant info. The main problem is that there are too many training plans with little to distinguish them. The criteria for ""fit"" vs. ""unfit"" are almost identical and the plans themselves seem very conservative. A previous reviewer mentioned the ""team"" training plans, and I agree that these are redundant.Another issue is that there is minimal emphasis on swimming; for beginners, swimming is probably the most difficult discipline to get comfortable with, so this seems like a poor approach. There are some useful tips on bike fit and nutrition, yet probably far too much info for a beginner. I strongly recommend the training plans, info and general style of the ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" ahead of this book."
2,Disappointing training plans,"The training plans in this book for ""fit"" (there are two sets of plans for each distance: ""fit"" vs. ""unfit"") are way too conservative. I found myself using the Olympic distance plan to train for a Sprint distance triathlon. There is no way following the ""fit"" Olympic distance plan I could have completed that distance. It's suitable for training for a Sprint however but that's not what is intended by the author.I also find it annoying that so much of the book is dedicated to these different flavors for both individuals and for teams. It began to feel like me that the author was padding the book to make it longer.Since most folks (like me) would buy a beginner book for the training plans I cannot recommend this book to a beginner to formulate a plan unless you feel like under-training and slogging through your first event."
2,Not much substance...,"I found this book very easy to read...in fact it only took me about 1.5 hours to get through the whole thing. I don't consider this an attribute. So much of this book is dedicated to the training plans! There is really no reason to waste so many pages on training plans when each person only needs to pick one. The other big waste of pages was the overly long and descriptive chapter on equipment. The book is called ""basics"" - why does it need to go into such detail on equipment that most beginners won't want to invest in anyway?I was very disappointed in the amount of good substance in this book. Glad I didn't buy it but instead checked it out from the library!"
1,Do not spend your money!! Extremely Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed that I spent my money on this study guide. I purchased 4 study guides and this was by far the worst one!! The Math review section is the worse section - it DOES NOT provide the explanatory answers so you don't know how to correct your answer! The Biology review is vague -- not enough information is covered-- especially for the TEAS exam. Verbal ability is adequate.PLEASE do not spend your money as I did. There are alot of nursing study guides out there that are far better than this one. I highly recommend McGraw Hill's Nursing School Entrance Exam.If you purchase this one, you will be disappointed and frustrated that you wasted your time (and money) with very little in return."
2,Arrived quickly,"Great book for showing how the test may be, but should show where to obtain info you may not know. I can take the test but where is the best place to find the answers?"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I bought it to study for the nursing exams, the entire exam is math and english not science"
1,Great Product Bad Price,I love the idea of coming home and having it right at my door step. But the Amazon Price doesn't justify it. If the Price point was at or around $35 I would shop here instead. Disappoints me because Amazon usually has very good prices.
3,Tide,The product arrived with a small hole in it. it's 2 months later and the soap powder is still in it/
5,Thank you.,"I received this item promptly and in great condition. The expression of the music is outstanding, and Burrowes' voice is powerful without being screechy or strained. A must-buy for Handel/Baroque fans."
4,An oratorio like an opera.,"This performanca is pleasant and interesting, full of very good pages, like the celebrate aria of Juppiter or the quartetto of the first act. Good Gardiner and the orchestra. Good , but not always excellent, the singers."
1,Incomplete,"All I have to say, is that the conductor of this recording-John Eliott Gardiner- is a conductor that is ignorant. The reason why I say this, is that when I bought two recordings made by Gardiner, i noticed that- in ""La Clemenza di Tito"" has a number of missing recit. in the opera. In this opera, he has missed half of the aria's of Act I and Act III. I was madly dissapointed at him. I mean, who has the right to take out arias and reciy.? I am dissapointed, John Eliot Gardiner is not a Handel Conductor. Do not buy this recording, it has missing aria's and has a horrible recording"
1,Not true to size,"Although they looked nice, I had to return them as they are not true to size.The size shows it being a U.S. 7 1/2 but inside the sneaker it is also labelled a European size 38 5/8 (or thereabouts). This is not 7 1/2 but more like 8 1/4 or so.As they were much too big, I can't comment with regard to comfort etc. as I couldn't walk in them.Otherwise, they do seem to be nicely made."
5,Great quality. durable.,"Absolutely a recommended buy! They aren't very popular in stores, but they are a long-lasting hardcore product. Built to last and keeps reliable internet speeds/connection."
4,ready to rumble cd,"What a great cd! They have awesome songs, especially Bif Naked who sings ""We're not going to take it"" and Kid Rock with ""Bawitdaba"". I can't stop listening to it. The movie Ready to Rumble was great, and the lead singer from Bif Naked was in it. This is a great cd!"
5,A beautiful book with a charming subject,"Finding Nemo may have made this fish famous but they have always been fantastic in my view. This book covers all of what you need to know about this family of fish. Well written, great pics. 5 Stars."
5,This Book is Right On!,"Though I've only had this book for 24 hours now, I already feel compelled to review it. IMOHO, other authors in this hobby should read this book and try to produce similar materials. Highlight are: -Excellent flow from clownfishes in the wild through breeding, -Well illustrated (nice pictures and nice charts), -Written in a nice voice that is both easily understood by novices and compelling to advanced hobbyists (I'm speculating on the ""advanced hobbyist"" judgement here since I consider myself intermediate), -Methodical (ie. I believe that hobbyists could follow these instructions and breed clownfishes), -Fun (ie. I bought this book to learn more about one of my favorite SW families, but now I'm going to take the plunge and try to breed them).I like this book."
2,Painful To Listen To,"Of the 11 tracks, maybe one has a rythm you can follow. The remainder of the tracks sound like Mays is playing with one finger. I've tried to listen to this CD at least six time. The first time all the way through then just skipping tracks that were going no where until finally I could only listen to the last track. The only reason I'm giving this CD two stars and not one is because it did elicit an emotion, albeit an agonizingly painful experience."
4,Takes some getting used to,"Lyle functions best in the context of the Pat Metheny Group, and of his other album I only liked the first one, which (surprise) is the most similar in setup to the Group.This Solo album has flashes of brilliance, but too much of it meanders without any point. If you're willing to take the time to listen to this many times, you might get something out of it, but it might be more effort than you're willing to give."
4,Take it or leave it,"This is surely an album you'll enjoy or hate. The 8 improvisations can be a bit unusual at times, sometimes sounding like a horror film, other moments serene. Sounds like Keith Jarett in a studio with synthesizers. On a technical note, this is his first album without the Oberheim and Prophet Five synths. Those two keyboards died before production.Hearing the last two tracks ""Locked in Amber"" and ""Long Life"" is a nice musical flow, reminiscent of the feeling you get from ""Close To Home."""
2,"Well, it was a nice idea...","The concept of this album is far better than its execution. A totally improv cd, with post-production additions and effects. Unfortunately, I just don't go for free form music, and that's all this is. I would be hard pressed to sing along with it, or recognize any theme. So as much as this is a great concept, I wish it had been done more melodically."
2,You can do better,"I own every Jan Hammer cd and this is by far the weakest. The only decent tunes on this release are already available on the 'Complete Miami Vice' cd. Disappointingly lightweight fuzak, IMO."
1,Interesting yet hard to understand.,"Dont get me wrong, if i would speak German i would love this book but even starting with the title it is hard to understand. What does monographien und texte zur mean anyways. I've read books before in languages i don't understand and loved them. O yeah and where is Nietzsches?"
5,Great...but waiting for more,"Without going into specifics every episode of this season and every other season has been and always been fantantisc! What I am wondering is when are seasons 2002, 2003, 2004, etc going to come out? As a huge fan I can't just have part of the series - I want the whole thing. By all means though this is worth your money - every penny!"
1,Won't last longer than 2 to 3 months,"The first one I received lost its vacuum after only 2 months. Amazon sent me another one. It lost its vacuum after only 2 1/2 months. When I sent an e-mail to Stanley to ask for a replacement they ignored me. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! Although the Thermos brand by Nissan has a smaller neck which makes it more difficult to put ice into it, their thermos actually does last a lifetime."
4,GOOD THERMOS,A good thermos for a coffee lover where the workplace does not provide coffee all day. The one problem with thermos: it does not keep coffee extremely hot for more than two hours unlike smaller volume thermos.
2,Not boiling hot but just hot.,"I own both the Thermos Nissan 61 oz silver/black one and this Stanley brushed classic 2 qt. Fill them both with boiling hot water to the top and close for overnight. The next morning, the Stanley will be hot but barely enough to make a batch of tea which you can begin to sip immediately. The Nissan will literally burn your lips hot. ( Also have the Rugged 1 qt Stanley bottle but due to its smaller volume, it loses heat even faster ) I think the major problem is the head/neck which you can feel the heat with the bottle closed. For about the ten dollar difference, go for the Nissan over the Stanley."
1,disappointed,"It won't keep my coffee hot for more than a couple of hours even with pre-heating. When I poor in boiling water to pre-heat the outside immediately gets very hot .... this tells me that there is no vacuum. I've had this issue with another Stanley bottle as well. They replaced it twice under their warranty which was nice, but both of the new ones had the same problem. I won't buy another product from them again."
2,Cool on heat,"This 2 qt vacuum bottle boasts it will keep your hot brew hot for apprx. 24 hours. Following filling first with boiling water and allowing to sit, before adding my hot beverage, I found it only kept coffee hot to warm for about 6-8 hours. Far short of the boastful 24 hours.For you coffee drinkers, who intend on making a long day of it, in the on coming cooler season stay clear of this one. Suggestion: if you take milk with your coffee, heat it before adding. You may get closer to the 24 hr mark than I did.Leaving by your campfire may help keep its heat as well.P Coleman"
3,you get what you pay for (it's cheap),"this gauge has a pretty dinky feel to it and not super accurate. if you want something better than those pencil gauges, get this. I have the pricey german types which blow this away, but if you leave this on the armco at your track, you won't burst into tears. it's good enough for casual track days, but if you race a motorcycle or car and need super accurate tire pressures, I'd shy away. It looks cool, like the picture and will do the job for most applications. Especially the home garage."
4,Cutting board,What can be said? It's a cutting board. You can cut things on it. It looks pretty nice on the counter.
2,You get what you pay for,These brakes are barely within manufactures specs such that they did not fit my car without slight modification with a dermal. They took up 2mm more space in circumference than the drum would allow for. This could be due to a thicker than usual shoe or that the frame for the shoe was slightly off. Either way there is a tip on the shoe frame that can be grinded off by 1.5mm with a dermal that solves 75% of the problem. The other 25% is solved by driving after tightly fitting the drum on and wearing down the pad by the other .5mm. Disappointing? Yes! A lot of unneeded work? Of course. Again I would not recommend these shoes. I hope this helps anyone considering these shoes. The only reason I gave them two stars is because I have actually seen worse.
3,"Not terrible, but not great","This was a bit of a let down. I expected a much clearer story line and telling. This is a book all Forgotten Realms fans should read, but probably just the once. Its hard to follow at times and kinda leaves you wanting to know a bit more at the end. Not what I've come to expect from Ed Greenwood. His other books were wonderful; this one, could of used some work."
3,"An oddity, but not a bad one","One would probably rate this book as an odd work of Greenwood. It is that. It builds around flashbacks, the technique used in this book is quite interesting. It seemed a bit odd to me at first, not to talk about it being not written on my native language, but I got into it after few evenings of reading. I won't recommend this for those who are not seriously into this Realms series of books or reading in some other way, but for those who are, this is important part of Greenwood's production and literature. Not a bad book certainly."
2,Mildly entertaining but got too repetitive in the end.,"I read quite a lot of Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms novels and I enjoyed most of them. However, Elminster in Hell is one of his lesser works. While I have enjoyed Elminster's earlier books, this one was bit on the boring side. It had an interesting premise and story but the writing and concept got rather boring as the story line got repetitive. Its also a book of ""flashbacks"" which is nothing but Elminster trying to buy time for himself. The story also dispelled some disbelief at this weak arch devil who have Elminster in his power but still allowed himself to be toy by his victim. Overall, I thought the book was the weakest of the four Elminster novels and one of Ed Greenwood's lesser efforts."
1,Just About the Worst Book I've Ever Read...,"I keep reading Ed's work, specifically about Elminster, because I assume that Ed, being the Forgotten Realms legend, and Elminster, being the greatest of all FR heroes, that there has to be something good there. Well, after three very poorly written books, this one reading like a very confusing screen play, I realize that Elminster is who he is, a very weak, uncompelling character who always is begging to his deity to save his butt. The story was difficult to follow because of the insane format of the writing that Ed chose to use in this novel. The only reason I read it through to completion was in the hopes that it would somehow lift itself from its dark grave, or, that at least I would feel empowered to save the rest of you and be able to write this review with a clean conscience. If your looking for good FR stories, well developed characters with motivations, and such, read some RA Salvatore."
1,Good for skimming and nothing else.,"I had read the other elminster books and found them to be on the level. This one however, seemed to be written for no other reason than to make money. I found myself skimming through the book to find ANYTHING that was at all exciting to read. If I wanted to read about one mans random thoughts I would write my own down."
2,Pretty much a bunch of extra filler,"While the plot of the book was good, and the way he used the memories to keep power from Nergal was an interesting idea. The story basicly could have been condensed into a single chapter, or even less. It was a nice concept just way overkilled. After the 200th flashback or so my mind started to feel like it was being eaten by the same mindworm Elminster was. I was looking for something very different than what I read in this book."
3,a long slow read,"this was a long slow read, ok the story was ok, just seemed like i could easily put it down, not like some books where you almost try to read it in one night as the story moves so well, it was ok"
1,A Horrible book,"I have never liked Greenwood's books, but this one was a 0 star rating. At first I thought it to be an O.K. read but after a while I could almost predict what was going to happen. It was just a bunch of jarbled ideas, and the plot was VERY repetative. DO NOT BUY"
1,boring!,with the elminster series you expect a good book not here. id give more of a review but it doesnt deserve the time
5,Necessity For home and car !!,"I believe in keeping my tires inflated with the proper amount of air.saves on fuel , tire wear and helps keep us safe from blowouts etc. This is the perfect tire gage for that. Bleed valve for quick and easy inflation. Great product."
2,Prohibitive price,"Okay, so never mind the fact that producing a DVD has a set of costs having nothing to do with the production (writing, acting, other production values) of the original show for TV. Even still, GI Joe is a bunch of half-hour episodes. Buffy and Angel Season sets are an hour-long on TV and there are 22 of each a year. They sell for less than this GI Joe set. Plus, they have way more extra features. I loved this show when I first saw it at age 4, as I did Transformers, and mourned its death after the movie in 1987; what came after was awful, including the theme song (""Got to get tough"" anyone). However, aren't both the realization that these stories are embarrassingly bad and the cost prohibitive to people who loved it once buying it?"
3,Nothing that you can't find anywhere else.,"If you've already read Michael Kennedy's Life and Works of Ralph Vaughan Williams or Ursula Vaughan Williams's R.V.W., you can skip this. It is little more than an expanded encyclopedia entry and the stuff that isn't is problematic. Heffer's an enthusiastic amateur, with either little or no musical training. That may even count as an advantage in a work for the general reader. However, it gets him in trouble when he renders critical judgments, which tend to sound like he's gotten them from others' reviews. He certainly doesn't build much of a case in support. An ordinary book about an extraordinary composer."
5,Wonderful listening from beginning to end!,"I attended a Sam Bush concert in Hickory, N.C. in 1998 and was expecting John Randall Stewart as the guitar player. Not to take anything away from John (he's very talented) but having never heard Darrell Scott play or sing, my wife and I were blown away. Darrell provides you with an unbelievable feeling when you hear him sing and/or play. His music is the way music is supposed to make a person feel. I promise you, any music purchased that has even a hint of Darrell Scott in it is worth every penny."
5,maison du peuple,"i want the idea of the architect(victor horta), that design this buildings(maison du peuple) and style of the buildings and biogarafy of the buildings and architect and the most reasons that horta buit this buildings in this style and model."
3,More brazed than welded,"I bought this book to get technique and how-to ideas and found it gave extensive how-to directions for HIS method of build-up brazed sculpture using oxy/acet torches. His instructions on building basic structures, frameworks, melting/dribbling on brazing rod to fill-in/surface the framework, and mounting/finishing your sculpture are well done. BUT, it only gave (very) limited technique ideas on other metal sculpture techniques. If you are interested in using electric based welding techniques to build steel, stainless or alum sculptures, you may want to look elsewhere."
3,Great reference book for those who have had the chance to browse it.,"I bought two of this book for a friend and myself. We are both college professors and were enrolled at the time in an asessment course for children with special needs. Unfortunately, my book was stolen before I could even browse it. Therefore, I should infer it is a good book. I know my colleague has used it in many occasions as a reference in a course she teaches. I cannot offer a review of the book."
5,Thank You Carolyn!!!,Cleansing opens your eyes to all the dangers and hidden things we know nothing of or are aware of that can cause us to get sick or worse. I only wish I could keep on the detoxification and live a super clean life. This book was well researched and presented in terms we can understand. (...)
4,El mejor Merengue de la reina verdadera de Merengue.,"Gocé todas las selecciones de este CD. Mil se queda verdadero a su música y su música no se cede. Quiero especialmente su dúo con Hector Bambino ""Mala Palabra"". ""Quiero Ser"" y ""Me Da Pena"",La felicitaciónes a Milly, el CD es un éxito completo."
3,Okay review book,This book is part of a board review course. The text is copies of slides shown during the course with some quiz questions at the end of each chapter. It reviews straight content and is similar to stuff seen in years 1 & 2 of medical school. Not written in case format or patient context. Some times the slides are out of order but the information is accurate. A little difficult to study from and then apply to clinical practice. I'd recommend using it with another study aid as well.
5,flavorfilly,This flavorful relish goes with almost everything. It's sweet but not too; hot and spicy but not too; Try it with crackers and cream or goat cheese; on scrambled eggs; in deviled eggs; on meats and chicken; lovely
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!!!!!!!,"It will not work, see everyone else's comments. I am throwing mine away and getting another brand. Customer Service at Bosch is terrible, warranty covers nothing. I waited about 4 years too long to replace."
1,Do Not Recommend,"I have had this unit for several years and I consistently get error codes (EA and EC) and no hot water. Bosch replaced the control unit within six months of installation but it continues to have problems. Bosch customer service is very poor, you may be on hold for over half an hour at a time and may have to talk to several people to get an answer. In addition it is difficult to find a certified Bosch technician in the area. You may be better off with Rinnai or Takagi brands as they are more reliable."
1,Be warned!,"Our conventional water heater failed we decided after seeing shows such as Ask this old house, that we would get a tank-less water heater. Thinking Bosch was a quality name we went with it. My husband is very handy and we decided we would install it ourselves, purchase all the appropriate parts, this installation took over 8 hours on a Saturday. Since day one we have had nothing but problems. As others have said the tech support is no good. It errors out EVERY day sometimes more than once and every time you turn on the water or flush the toilet it sounds like a diesel down shifting...I'm to the point where I'm afraid to leave the house for fear it's going to blow. We are seriously thinking of replacing it with a conventional one...unless we can find a more reliable tank-less. But really Bosch should take care of it. A house with a mechanic, and two teenagers NEEDS a reliable hot water heater!!"
1,One of the worst peices of equipment I have ever owned,"I am so sick of this water that I can't stand it anymore. After spending a huge amount of money for purchase and installation. And having to have a serviceman out to calibrate and repair a poorly engineered part, within the first several months of ownership. Then having to pay to have my gas meter replaced to allow for the high rate of gas usage by this unit, I now have to reset the unit about twice a day when it just won't start and gives an error code message... Think long and hard before you purchase this unit. It wouldn't let me give no stars...."
4,It's great!,"I do not have the other albums in this series -- I want to get them, though. I have this in rotation with some other Christmas albums -- I love the songs on this one..."
3,For collectors,"If you are into the Ultra Lounge series as I am, then you will want this album in your collection. I have the previous two Christmas albums which I think are better than this 3rd addition, but still worth having if you are a fan of this stuff."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Christmas Cocktails, Vol. 3, was a big disappointment, and a closer look at the liner notes reveals why: the compilation producer of the first two (and the original Ultra-Lounge Series) was Brad Benedict, whose selections for Volumes 1 & 2 were truly inspired.The compilation producer for Volume 3 is a Frank Collura, who apparently doesn't get the concept. The result is a very pedestrian Christmas album with none of the flair of the Ultra-Lounge series.It also has no bonus tracks and is missing the extensive liner notes of the original series.Too bad."
2,An example of why the music industry is in trouble today...,"The first two ""Christmas Cocktails"" CDs were absolute classics--a wide variety of music--some familiar, some esoteric--and a great value. Volume 3? Well, it's got some wonderful tracks on it, but for the most part, it's a very ordinary song selection.Perhaps most troubling--and why the music industry is in such dire straits today--it the fact that they give you less and less for your dollar. The first two volumes in this series were 72 and 64 minutes, with 21 and 20 tracks, respectively. Volume 3 is under 40 minutes with just 15 tracks. Plus they eliminated the liner notes booklet, and now only have a one sheet insert. And all for the same price as volumes 1 & 2.If Capitol wants consumers to buy their ""physical"" product, give them some reason to do so--provide something they don't get via a download (legal or not). And don't cut back so much on the content itself--value ""added"" gets more buyers, not value ""subtracted""."
5,YAY! A THIRD!!,"Love this kind of music - can't get enough - have most all of the CDs. Excellent New Jersey-based company with excellent foresight and retro-understanding for the best party and jazz combos. Excellent choice for any kind of day or evening, party or relaxation time."
3,It doesnt go with the other 2,"I love the Christmas Cocktails Cd's. They are my favorite ""New"" Christmas albums, and although this cd is good, it doesnt fit well with the christmas cocktails I and II. The songs are nice but not as eccletic as the original 2 albums. I dont like the version of ""baby its cold outside"" with sammy davis jr. and Carmen Mcrae, its more creepy than cute. And what i thought would be good,""Sorry to See you Go"" by June Christy, is just a bad song altogether and so is ""Do you Believe in Santa Claus"",- not good. On the other hand all the other songs are great, ""Jingle Bells"" by Johnny mercer, is ""Cocktail Worthy"" as is the slow and sultry version of ""ive got my Love to Keep me Warm"" by Julie London and Nancy Wilsons ""Thats What i want for Christmas""."
4,A quality book on growing all kinds of begonias,"This 200 page British entry caters mainly to the tuberous begonia grower but it also addresses the other types of begonias. It does a good job of describing the history and cultivation of each class of begonia. Although only tuberous begonias are illustrated, the descriptions of begonias are well done, giving accurate desciptions of the plants, foliage, growing habits and flowers as well as the parentage for the hybrids. Sections on Growing for Showing, Hybridizing, Propagation, Pest and Diseases, and Composts are well written. I was impressed by the overall quality of the book. Of course, I would have liked more pictures of the begonias. This book is a ""keeper""."
5,One of the three best Begonia books in existance..,"A milestone for Begonia enthusiasts, it's a reference for the expert, and an excellent how-to for the newbee."
2,Disappointing,"Donahue's book and its themes have promise, but this has all been done before, such as in William T. Volmann's work on San Francisco or Palahniuk's on Portland--and those writers are engaging without seeming superior to their subjects, while Donahue's writing is often dry and tepid, and rarely infused with either the energy or the involvement his subject requires."
2,Random facts not helpful for many,"This ""Idiot's guide"" seems random adn disjointed. Not worth while to purchase if Lincoln facts in context are your goal."
2,never finished,"The book isn't an easy read and I think he draws out a little to much during some of the verses. I have actually never finished the book. I tried to read through it 2 or 3 times, but it was very hard to understand for me. (it could be because I am so simple-minded) I found it easier just to read through the book of Job and do my own journaling."
1,Looked used,I bought this and received it in a good amount of time but I did not use it in my truck. The prongs looked bent and the wires looked like someone had tried to use it before. Also I own a 2010 F150 stx this conector would have worked but you also need a interface that is extra to give your accessory wire power to make your stero work. The one I found was about $90 but I had a professional audio shop run a wire that eliminated the need for the interface. You will also need a dodge antenna adapter for it.
1,unhappy,I followed all of the questions but the product does not fit my radio. The cost of the part was not too high but included with the shipping it was a total waste. I'll probably never purchase an electronic part from amazon again.Bob
4,Good Deal,This product worked well on my 2007 Ford Five Hundred and was priced very reasonably. It was also easy to install.
4,It was 92% of what I needed!,"This was used to install a JVC in-dash GPS into a 2007 Mustang... and for that it functioned well enough. Unfortunately, as it turns out, the car uses an onboard network for some functions - and, as a result, there was no illumination line in the factory harness. I had to run a separate wire over to the illumination line for the headlight switch, which certainly was easy enough."
5,great dvd,wow. levon helm was just a great musician and showman. you can tell he really enjoyed what he did! yea!
1,Terrible sound,The sound on this dvd is just gruesome. Performance is way below expected. This is one in a long line of music dvd's and bd's which has terrible sound. Why bother to release such items? Does not the producer or the performer LISTEN to the sound before release? I think not. What a waste of money. I am sick of beiing robbed with bad releases like this. Also- the other reviewers here- how can they give top ****** for this? Reviews like that are misleading consumers.
2,It's sister is better,"I bought this set and the moisturizing set both. This one still sits in the back of my cupboard because I'm not crazy about it. It did not compare to the moisturizing properties of the purple moisture set and left my thick, slightly coarse hair limp and lifeless. I don't know why, but I just really don't like this. I do however have a positive review on Pureology Moisturizing shampoo/conditioner because it is the sister of this product and is my absolute favorite set. I use both every other day and this will probably be given to a friend for them to try when I clean out my cupboard.I'd think twice before trying."
1,Spare yourself--save your money,"If you are a discerning reader with taste, avoid the hassle, and do not buy this book. The dialogue is the first shortfall that you'll notice, with insipid lines such as 'well, Mac, while we have this time together, let's discuss this.' The next line of dialogue follows like this: 'well, I'd like to understand more about x. Please tell me about x.' If by chance you can manage to get past the dialogue, then you'll find yourself ripping out your hair because of the inane plot, and non-existent action. If by some chance you make it past all that, I dare you to not throw the 'book' into the fireplace for its countless editorial errors. 'I heard you've studied marshal arts.' 'I didn't mean to intimate you.' Perhaps the intimidation of spell check was too much for this author and her publishers. If there is any sane person out there who has noted these errors, and still managed to complete this tale, I applaud you!! I for one, quit after the first 130 pages."
1,Not even worth one star...,"This is one of the few books I've started to read and never finished. The plot for the book had a lot of potential. Three alien sisters leaving their home planet and seeking a new home on earth where they find the love of their lives. Sounds like a good read right? Wrong. The author butchered it. The problem is with the dialogue. It comes off like your reading a technical book. I read maybe 70 pages into it and every time one of the characters asked a question the answer went into an explanation how something works and it was a very in depth explanation. If I wanted to read about how radio waves work, I'd read about it in a book about radios. A romance book is no place for all this technical garbage. Basically, the author used long-winded explanations to fill in the book instead of actual dialogue and interaction between the characters. Save your money, it will bore you to sleep."
1,WELL BELOW AVERAGE!,"""Victoria Rose is an exciting new author..."" Hardly. The other 1 star review was right on target...but I couldn't even get past 50 pages. The only reason this book has a 5 star review is because it was submitted by a Kaye Trout--who someone wrote--is Victoria Rose. Save your money on this book."
1,Flimsy and does NOT stand up- NOT KID PROOF~,"What a disappointment!IT IS NOT EASY to set up since the shipping kinks in the walls NEVER smoothed out... I placed this pool on top of a heavy duty tarp which was fouled 4 times. The tarp was sitting in my ""playground"" on top of 12 Inches of Rubber Playground Bark-. Did everything to insure a nice safe cushiony base....... How sad it did not live up to its description!***This pool is not Kid Proof- The flimsy sides NEVER lost the kinks from shipping, hence never opened into the nice round shape pictured in the ad.***When the kids leaned against the FLIMSY WALLS they gave way and the water poured out.The only good thing I can say about this pool is it is a great size for 4-6 year old kids IF it was not so poorly made.After three disappointing attempts to get this pool to set up and stay filled with water I returned it! IT's so flimsy I even got it back into to its original box!Too bad it wasn't made better~ :-{"
4,Good deal for the money,"We ordered this pool for our dogs to play in on hot days. It is a little flimsy, but for the price, it was worth it. It is a good size and very durable, our dogs have not torn it up yet. Keep in mind that it does come rolled up, so it takes awhile for the pool to take a round shape once the water is in it."
2,Not worth the money,Its a cheap pool but its not even worth that money. We had only used it for a wk when we noticed the leak at the bottom.But I have to say It was really easy to set it up and clean.
2,Flimsy sides,"Sorry, I really wanted to like this pool but I didn't. The sides never really held up well. It was hard to fill and the sides started to sag and collapse on one side as the pool filled with water. I was never able to put as much water in it as I would have liked.Also, the bottom vinyl is very delicate. It was so easy to poke holes in that I never bothered trying to fix all the ones that happened the first time we used the pool and we never used it again. I had it on my concrete patio and put a blanket underneath the area where I set it up, still, at least 10 small holes were easily poked into the bottom in 1 hour of play.I ended up buying a rigid plastic pool from a local big box retailer that I would normally hate to step foot inside of...rhymes with Mall-Wart"
1,This is worst pool ever!!!,"This pool is flimsy, poorly made and sides will not stand up to allow it to even be filled and used. As soon as you start putting water in it the sides collapse and all water runs out. Horrible waste of money!!!!!"
4,I wanted to love this pool...,"but I have a love-hate relationship with it instead. haha I really did like it for my daughter (she is 13 months and we used it when she was like 10 months or so) for a little while. We could fill it up with just enough water to let her crawl around and it was perfect... and then the sides started falling down. Like it was literally falling down on itself since we didnt fill it all the way up (which wasnt feasible for us since our daughter was so small). I would think this would be a perfect kiddie pool for like a 3-4 year old. If you are putting it on grass MAKE SURE you put a tarp or something under it. You can feel all the stuff through the bottom (think pine cones, sticks, etc) and it can rip super easy."
3,"""pool for one summer only""","Should have listened to previous reviews!Looked just like the ones I had as a child.I was so excited to order it for my neice to swim until everyone else went in the ""big pool"". Its a good size, both in height and circumference, but the problem is when filling.Don't walk away, unless you have at least 5-7 inches of water in the pool already. I made the mistake by turning the hose on and walking away! The bottom seam doesn't keep the water even, most probably due to the flimsy walls. Its workable for a summer, but I highly doubt we'd go through the trouble next season. The cost definately is shown in lack of quality."
4,Lots of Fun,"This pool has provided lots of fun and entertainment for my kids (3, 5, and 7). They play in it for atleast an hour every evening. It has held up well, although I will say it takes awhile to fill and you have to hold the sides a bit until enough water can support them."
5,Happy to find this pool/replacement of old favorite worn-out one.,"I bought this pool for my Niece's little boy who had one before and it worked well. The old pool lasted very well but was worn out and used well. They could not find this pool in any stores in August. Luckily, Amazon found it at Ace Hardware outlet. It was just what they needed and the Birthday Boy (3 years old) was happy to be ""swimming"" again. I'm most impressed that it was found, purchased and arrived on time. It is easy to fill and empty. The water is what holds the sides up."
4,Sides stayed up just fine,We filled it to the top and the sides stayed up just fine. No problems at all. The kids LOVED it. Couldn't get them out of it. That's a lot of fun and exercise for $20 or under.
1,Garbage,"I bought this pool for my 20month old. As we were setting it up, a seam must of tore and water everywhere. We had it on a leveled surface and followed the directions. Do not buy this GARBAGE."
1,terrible purchase.,I reaceived this order and upon opening of the package found a hole on the side of the pool. The wall and the bottom of the pool wasn't sealed. Waste of money!
2,Arrived cracked,"I opened the box, set up the pool (very easy)and began filling. I came back to check on it, and realized it wouldn't fill past about the halfway mark because there was a 15-inch crack in the side. So I drained it and mailed it right back. My kids were very disappointed. Amazon's return process was very easy though."
4,"So far, very enjoyable","So far we are enjoying this pool, especially since the temperatures have been above average this year. I read the reviews and the first time I set it up I used my plastic patio chairs to help hold up the sides, it was not hard to do by myself at all. I really like that it is not inflatable. With a boy I figured he would get a hole in the inflatables much too quickly. Once the water was too dirty and I needed to refill it, the sides stayed up all by themselves even when empty. I have it set up on my patio so I have been using a tarp underneath it to protect the bottom. So far we haven't had rips. I just wish it was easier to empty and clean, but my 4 yr old is really enjoying it. I have even gotten in it a couple of times with him. Would recommend getting a tarp to cover it. We haven't had a lot of rain lately, so I am finding a lot of dead and drowning bugs in the pool."
5,Summer Time Fun,"I purchased a pool similar to this last summer. Unfortunately, it met the fate of our neighborhood lawn service's weed wacker. Nevertheless, we had so much fun with it, I knew I needed to purchase a new one. We live in a town home community, so I wanted a pool that was compact and not too big. This pool certainly meets that criteria. It's inexpensive, too. You need to have the pool filled almost to the top to really stabilize the sides. Also, if your lawn is naturally at a slant, you can expect the pool water to fill a bit unevenly. The diameter of this pool is great for 2-3 adults or about 4 young children. It's great summer time fun!"
1,wading pool,The pool looked good from the picture but once I received it and tried to set it up I realized how difficult it was to open and impossible to fold up again. I wanted to return it but we couldn't even fold it back to get it in the box. Buying it was a big mistake.
2,"Well, you don't have to blow it up!","I got this b/c I wanted something in between the hard plastic kiddie pool and an inflatable one.... It's roomy. Takes forever to fill up and is very flimsy. I guess if I filled it ALL the way to the top it might be sturdier, but I fill it half way and it just collapses in on itself. Not a huge fan. Oh, well, you live and you learn!"
1,Garbage,"Most frustrating piece of junk. The description on the box made it look like it just popped right up but it doesn't at all! If you're able to manage to get water into it, it will stay up but getting it to that point is not worth it. I felt like an idiot using both hands, my two feet spread apart and my toddlers to try and keep the sides up as it filled. What a chore for something that's supposed to be easy and fun."
3,seems ok for dog,"I bought this pool for my 70 pound 11 month old dog. It was obvious from the start that he would easily rip through the bottom. I bought a tarp (12'x 16,' I believe) , filled the pool with a couple inches of water, laid the tarp inside and pressed the air out from under it so it made an additional lining for the pool. Then, I filled the rest. There was so much overhang of the tarp that I am able to fold it back over and cover the pool too. So far, the puppy has only walked in it, but it seems like it will work fine. He has already crunched the sides in by leaning over the edges. it did no harm though. I bought this pool as an experiment to see if he likes the water. He has made a game of throwing his tennis balls in the pool and fishing them out. I'm sure when it gets hotter, he'll be in rolling around. For the price, it's working just fine."
2,Put a tarp under it or it will get holes in it after the first use,"We put this pool on our grass, which admittedly isn't the softest grass in the world, but I thought the pool would have lasted longer than one use. It had multiple holes after the first use. Also, the sides don't stay up very well and buckle with only 6"" of water in the pool. You get what you pay for. If you decide to purchase this pool make sure you put something under it. We will be going back to a hard plastic pool next summer."
5,Idioms,"Learning idioms is an essential element for English as a Second Language students. This book not only contains an extensive list of useful and commonly used idioms but, in contrast to others, includes exercises with each lesson helping ensure that the material is remembered."
1,HI,"Hi,thanks about that book but I think this book isn't acceptable and unfortunatly you axplained about it that it's acceptable but it's not because it's very old and it is for 1987 you sould explained about that;thanks and I hope I'll recive better books from you in the futureTHANKS Bye"
2,Green Irish Tweed by Creed Cologne for Men 4.0 oz / 120 ml Millesime Eau de Parfum Spray,"I love creed cologne's and this is my fourth one. To me it does smell pretty similar to Davidoffs Coolwater. I know, I know dont hate but they are very alike. The Creed is more complex as it wears in but again, reminds me of Coolwater. Sad to say, this is the first Creed I do not really care for. It seems to fade fast so is it possible I got a knockoff? The bottle looks authentic and has a ser# on it. Is there a way to verify the Serial #? OTOH, the Coolwater is used lasted much longer than the Creed....Not sure but I plan on going to Neiman Marcus where I live and going to sample all the creeds they have to compare with the stock of colgnes I have now to see if I have gotten duped. Willing to give it another chance when I get to the store. Keeping fingers crossed."
3,Enjoyable piece of film fluff,"There is nothing in this book that couldn't have been learned from other books or old Hollywood magazines and papers. This is hardly an in depth study. Still, I gather that most readers will pick this up for the beach or a cruise and only want some fast moving reading with lots of celebrity anecdotes (read ""gossip"") so this book delivers. I picked this up in a bargain bin for a dollar and think I got my money's worth."
1,Hollies 40th Box Set - A Disappointment,"Very disappointing is all I can say. Every hit that is included in the ""Live"" 6th disc is omitted form the 5 studio cd's. Yes, you spend $100 and do not get a studio version od ""Bus Stop"" ""Stop Stop Stop"" or ""Just One Look"". Also. nothing from the reunion album with Graham Nash, not even ""Stop In The Name Of Love"".The 3-CD set 30th Anniversary CD is much, much better.Even a couple of Alan Clarke or Terry Sylvester solo tracks would be better some of the drivel included here. And, of the 6 meager unreleased tunes, 4 are demo quality.All in all a very poor effort by whomever put this set together.Stay away."
3,Okay review - but not that great....,"After completeing college some time ago, I found I had to take the TASP test in order to enter a teacher education program in Texas. I hadn't done much math beyond balancing my checkbook for about 10 years, so I knew I needed a refresher on the quadratic formula. I bought this book, and really did it, but when I took the test I found much of the material I had prepared for was irrevelant, too easy, and generally just not on the test. The explanations were well written and a lot came back to me as I was studying, but in general, the questions on the actual test were more complex than this book led me to believe. The reading section also contained lengthy explanations on concepts that weren't even on the test. But I mean let's face it, the TASP isn't brain surgery - I hope I passed it anyway - but this book was only an okay preparation."
2,Don't Bother,This is more of a glorified list rather than a book. The book describes WHAT a PMO can offer -- but doesn't even remotely address HOW one would go about this task and doesn't even describe much about the services. There are better books available on this subject matter from Amazon -- don't detour here!
4,A Functional Gift,"This is a nice basket that doubles as a magazine rack when empty. Sturdy wicker with a handle so it can be easily moved, it will hold a reasonable amount of magazines. The cheese servers coming in a wood tray, (as opposed to a cardboard box that they usually are in), is a nice plus, the tray is small and shallow enough that you can set it inside a drawer, and it keeps your utensils in an easy to find location, instead of digging through others to search for them. The one caveat is that the quantity of food seems rather small, but the basket, utensils, and the set of small shallow bowls make up for some of that."
5,It is the UlTIMATE,"Maurice has the best tone quality ever! Any trumpet player around the world can tell it is him playing. He is simply the best there is. I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to listen to the best trumpet player in the world! All of Muarice Andre's cd's are great anyway, so you can't go wrong with this one."
3,ummm,"I was about to buy this cd but when I looked through the tracks, there wasn't Haydn's trumpet concerto. Come on people, it can't be the ultimate trumpet collection if Haydn's concerto, which is quintessential for every trumpet player, isn't on the cd."
1,Disappointed,"Bought 3 of these for my guys (6,9,13) thinking they would be perfect for tv watching/video gaming. Inflated them Christmas morning and they were a hit. It is now 8:45P Christmas night and 2 of them are already shriveled ghosts of their morning selves. I thought the Coleman brand meant something.....Morning after Christmas the 3rd chair headed south. The funny thing is the actual stool insert that bears most of the weight is fine in all 3. It is the outer shell inner front seams that seem to give."
4,"Not as good as the next two, but this is a really good series.",There are three books in the Island series and I have to admit the first one is my least favorite. They get so much better as the story unfolds in the other two books. I would definately get all three though and you need to read them in order. Very exciting for a 10 year old. We read these together and we both wanted to read longer than our normal 30 minutes.
5,Three Adventures-One series,"I think that Gordon Korman's Island trilogy is awesome. There are three books, and each one gets better as you read the series.Although the start of the first one is boring, the more you read the better it gets and then you don't want to put it down. If you like action, then the Island series contains the books for you.When six kids go on a boat trip because they are troubled, a storm comes and all hell breaks loose. They get trapped on an island. Do you know if they all make it or not? I guess you'll have to read them to find out. -Paul Kirk"
3,Not for a 3rd grader,My son is in third grade and read this for a book report. He pointed out several cuss words while reading this. I just wish the author had left out those words. Why take a good kids book and use that language?
3,Island,I thought that it was o.k. It was kinda boring 'cause there was a ship wreck and they all lived no injuries no nothing. I did'nt like the names.I don't think that Luke should of been there in the first place. And nether should Will 'cause the sister started most of the fights. I don't know what the plot is. I also don't know what the meaning is. So I don't like the book. there was'nt much excitment. Thats why I give it 3 stars.
1,Shipwreck,"ShipwreckShipwreck is a story about kids who did things to get themselves in trouble. They got in A fist fight at school and so their parents sent them to a some what boot camp on a ship.Kids who get on this ship are there because their parents are mad at them for getting in a fist fight. With the rope tugging at him he fails to hang on and the sail falls on him. The captain almost crashes into an island. ""We're seeing ten foot waves the captain yells pulling the halyard with the half open mainsail.I thought this book was a good book if you like comedy. You will like it if you area funny guy."
5,"Shipwreck (island, book1)",I loved the book it taught me alot about the sea.I really recommend this book.
4,Island,"I rated this book 4 stars. The reason is I like it but it's not the best book I've ever read. I thought Island was a really good book! I liked how it ended, because you need to read the 2nd book to find out what happens. The book's about 6 kids, Lyssa, Will, Ian, Luke, J.J., and Charla, that go on a boat because they have done bad things, watched too much t.v. , and is too perfect. When the captain gets hit by the mainmast and goes into the ocean during a storm, the 6 kids are left with Mr. Radford, the boat's first mate. Mr. Radford leaves the kids on the boat because he knows it's sinking. When the boat catches on fire, they have to get off it. So, they're in the sea and four of them are together, but I won't tell you how it ends. I enjoyed reading this book."
4,Castaway For Kids,"Take six kids, throw them into the ""Charting A New Course"" program for troubled youth aboard the Phoenix and the journey begins. Most of them don't want to be there and most of them don't really like each other very much. But, when a brutal storm hits, the kids become castaways forced to worked together to survive. This first book in Gordon Korman's series is well-plotted and uses an appealing mix of kids--rich and poor, boys and girls, shy and outgoing. Perfect for third and fourth graders who want an adventure read!--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"
3,Good Book,"For those who like adventurous books, you would really like this. You always are wanting to know what's going to happen next!"
2,There's better,"I'm just not a fan of the French school of oboe. Pierre Pierlot's tone is too bright and whiny. He is quite an accomplished oboist technically, but his sound is not to my taste at all. The oboe should have a warm, dark, rich sound. All in all, there are better recordings out there. I have yet to find one of the Marcello Concerto in c minor that I like."
4,Skinny Ankles Only!,I have fairly small ankles and the strap barely fit me on the last whole. It's such a beautiful shoe and I love them but if someone has thicker ankles they'd be very dissappointed and the return policy isn't so great.
4,Feel better,I'm not sure exactly how this is working but I feel better and have more energy. I would recommend this product for perimenopausal women.
2,"Decent paper, but pixelated graphics on the poster.","Decent paper quality, but the post seems to have been ripped off of google images and then printed. Massive amounts of pixelation, as well as a watermark from a website on the lower right hand side.Would not buy again."
5,Like an old friend comes home.,"I've been into the ARA since ""Too Stuffed To Jump"" in the early ""70s. I have every vinyl album and have been waiting for something, anything from them on CD. I hope this sells well to let the company know some of us can't wait. ""Live"" is a compilation of some of their good stuff, but they neglected to include ""Dancing The Night Away"", which I consider their signature song. Regardless, Russell Smith and the band are as good on this CD as when I saw them at the Palamino Club in West Hollywood in the early '80s. I hesitate to group them, but Country, Blues, Boogie, R&R all fit. Smith's guitar, voice, writing and singing are all true to form and brought a tear to my eye when ""The End Is Not In Sight"" began the to play. Although their catalog of records is a better choice, this is a very good example of ARA music. Highly recommend."
4,It's ARA what else can you say,"It's good but like a live grearest hit's album. They have a much better live cd Full House. The sound is a lil off and it's the same cd as Live in America. Make sure you get Stacked Deck , Too Stuff to Jump, A.R.A, and put this one futher down the list. A great band and great music but they have much better stuff. Too Stuffed and Stacked Deck are on God's ipod but not this one"
4,hopefully volume 7 will be better.,"let me just get this out of the way, this volume was pretty much (at least, i sincerely hope), created just to set up volume 7. it doesn't really get interesting until the last couple chapters. the rest is just kind of meh. also, alucard is in this for about 5 pages. not even in a row, just spread out because he is still on the ship that he destroyed in volume 5. so overall, this book is merely ok. not the best, not the worst. i suggest this only to people who are fans of the series and want to know what happens to the hellsing crew. otherwise, this book won't interest you a whole lot. now, to count down the days until volume 7 arrives."
2,Here's my money guide...,"Don't buy this book and save yourself (the money). It's all common sense stuff in here, you won't learn anything new."
4,Charming...The Adults Enjoyed it Too!,"This is a charming book, my husband read this aloud to our 6 year old and we all enjoyed hearing the updated version of the classic story of The Frog Prince.The story was sweet and funny and the language was amusing. I don't know how well I would have done with it if I had been the reader, but my husband really got into it...the frog prince has a bit of a speech impediment.We have read our daughter many, many, many books that she enjoyed and we did not but this one was a hit with old and young alike.I also like that it's a chapter book with pictures, our daughter was reluctant to move away from chapter books with pictures so this was perfect for us. It's a sophisticated enough story with pictures to add to the enjoyment for her."
2,Donna does better...,"Now, this was not a terrible book, but it wasn't great eithier. It starts when Jade, a frog who tells the story, discovers a strange new frog. It's a prince who has been transformed by an old hag. We never learn why, so that bugged me. Jade calls the prince ""Pin"", for the prince cannot speak right with his new tongue, which can be annoying sometimes. I found the pictures to be a nice addition. Overall, a cute story that later veers away and becomes serious...which ruins the whole thing."
4,"Surprising, refreshing, moving.","Do not hope to find a single familiar christmas melody here. All music is original, and I mean REALLY original. (If you want just traditional Christmas listening, get Yelena's piano ""When Christmas is Near"" CD). But this one is truly refresing and inspirational. The only thing that prevented me to give it five stars was that I do not appreciate readings of the Bible in between the musical tracks. I'd much prefer to have the music without interraption. Anyway, this is THE album to listen at Christmas eve. Strongly reccomended! Mike."
4,"Lighten up, people, it's great fun","I think this set has been unfairly maligned. Many of the critical reviews here complain that the cartoons aren't as good as the black & white Fleischer Studios' Popeye shorts. And while that is certainly true, it doesn't mean that these cartoons are bad.Many of them feature outrageous situations which set them apart from the more grounded approach taken in the earlier cartoons. But any Popeye fan worth his (sea) salt will recognize that Segar's original comic strips often featured his characters in situations which stretch credibility beyond the breaking point.These cartoons from 1960-61 are colorful, quick and fun. I was highly entertained throughout all 85 (!) shorts. And I don't know why some reviewers are claiming the 'toons aren't remastered; they look fantastic. The set is also a great deal for the price."
3,Learn to Fast Forward,"The title of this DVD collection featuring 86 of the 1960-61POPEYE TV-cartoons is an insult to millions of people stillwaiting for a DVD release of the classic Fleischer cartoons.Having said that, this COULD HAVE BEEN an entertaining collection of the best of the 220 TV-cartoons, produced byvarious animation studios. Instead, cartoons where body partsvanish during a scene, Olive Oyl grows an extra eye and characters speak with the wrong voices abound! The best cartoons on this DVD are the ones produced by Paramount Cartoon Studios (watch for the name WINSTON SHARPLES on the credits)and fast forward through the ones with the name HUGH FRASIER.Apparently an animation historian wasn't consulted in the selection of these cartoons and it shows. If you really want to waste your money, just keep your finger on the fast forward button."
4,Not Max Fleischer but not bad either,"I have the Fleischer studios from 1933-43. They are excellent to say the least. This King Feature collection does not come close BUT it is a nice collection. I remember the Jeep,Alice the Goon and my favorite, Dr. Whatterschnozzel. There are some lame cartoons here also, maybe 5% of the 85 total episodes.The copy quality ranges from fair to very good. I can not tell you how well they compare to the originals because I originally saw them in black and white. The animation is good quality, not great. Better than today's stiff,storyboard style."
1,Not the cartoons you want,"I feel misled. I had the idea that a 75th anniversary collection would celebrate the great cartoons that made Popeye famous. Instead, the collection is based entirely on the 1960's Popeye cartoons, which are plain awful. One star is too many. Avoid."
1,Fleischer is King; the rest is silence,"To the reviewer with ISSUES about purists: I feel heartily sorry for you, that you would neither ""know nor care"" about the difference between the Fleischer-produced (1933-1942) Popeyes and the garbage that ran on TV in the sixties. In response to your witty commment, ""they're only cartoons, get a life"", I can only say that for this hopeless geek, those little works of art (indeed, all of Fleischer's output) are indeed some of the things that make life worth living. Good luck."
2,Not the original classics,I should have read the comments section before I bought this DVD set. The popeye cartoons are not the original classics. This version of Popeye came out later in the 60's. Very dissapointed.
1,What A Rip....Thanks King Features TV Sydicate,"I was very disappointed when I began to view this boxed set. I was expecting, had I thought to read reviews I would not have, the well made Fleischer cartoons. But I in fact was fooled into buying complete rubbish. I suppose if one grew up watching these low grade films they may indeed enjoy them but for anyone who wants down right excellently written and well animated Popeye cartoons I would suggest not buying this poor excuse for Popeye animation, And to speak frankly ""Coffee House"" is an insult to earier Popeye Cartoons. I am yet to make it through all of the episodes. Not to downplay the DVD's at all but the Popeye Trivia included was definitely worth the 35 friggin' dollars, because as far as I'm concerned that was all I recieved - a fancy case to carry a couple of crummy questions in. One again, thanks King Features TV Syndicate. Horrible, simple horrible."
2,pop in the eye!(75yrs.? col. ed.?)-no! its not...,"too many lousy co. choices of the 85! eps.; i only mostly liked apx 15 eps. they left out--brutus as a jeannie, brutus ep where his theme is loud and continuous around a place of business vs. popeye, ep where popeye says olive looks like a puppet, POPEYE THE PIANO MOVER, & POPEYE DE LEON-are at least some i was hoping for also on this set but-alas the biggest fear is still-NO.""THEY"" NEED TO SELL ALL POP. EPS. but no, SO WE GET sporadic collec. OF ALL THE APX 76YRS. it leaves out the many of the few best, LOUSY.THERE ARE 3 EPS. IN A ROW INCLUDIN POPEYES USED CAR THAT HAVE NO DIALOGUE AUDIO AT ALL ON TOP OF it ALL-MORE MANUF. CO. ERRORS.1 GOOD THING IS THAT THESE ARE MAINLY 60'S EPS. for me, W/ very FEW '61 EPS & ARE THE NICE KING FEATURES CO. MADE."
4,"Great for what it is, and much better than nuttin' atoll!","This DVD set is great for what it is. A fairly huge collection of not-so-circulated 1960's Popeye cartoons. Sure, they arent the Fleischer versions, but its better than all the forever-repeated public domain titles, and way better than nothing at all.Have fun. And dont leave home without yer spinach!UPDATE:After having watched this set a few times I have to say that I am very happy with KOCH's mastering of these episodes to DVD. They look great. Bright, clean, clear, no artifacts, M-M-M-Good! The only issue I have is there is a sudden audio crackle at the beginning of one episode that made me jump becuase it was so loud. Hahaha.Anyways. Good job to KOCH, now how about some Rocket Robinhood or Mighty Hercules?!? Heheh. I recommend to everyone who is intrested in obscure cartoons to pick up KOCH's other box set; Krazy Kat & Ignatz Mouse, and the upcoming Galaxy Rangers dvds."
1,"""Alice the Goon is a frightful buffoon!""","This collection should be called `The Worst of Popeye.' Don't be fooled by the attractive packaging, these cartoons stink on ice! Featuring Sweapea (who sounds like Olive Oyl), ""Brutus"" instead of Bluto, and that goofy Jeep Jeep thing, these shows are poorly animated and painfully annoying...and they just NEVER stop! The set boasts 85 ""full-color favorites"", but it seems more like 850...or 8,500. Getting a lot of content for your money is usually a good thing but in this case it's more like torture. Avoid this and save up to buyPopeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Vol. 1instead."
2,Joke Gift Gone Wrong,"I bought this for my friend Ed because he is a HUGE Packers fan; I thought he would FREAK THE HECK out, because as you may know, the Packers and the Bears are sort of rivals. Well, he did freak out, but not in the way I thought; it turns out that he didn't realize it was a ""Bears"" couch and was all like ""Wow! I needed a new couch really bad!"".So the good news is I have ALL SORTS OF PICTURES of ED on this couch in his TIGHT Packers shirts that he wears all the FREAKING time - the bad news is that I really want to get his goat but didn't here, and now I'm out like $500 and since I'm on Social Security that's a lot of money!Product Review - This thing is really comfy. I've been sleeping on it lately and have found out that it stains easy. I bet it's good for curling up with a good book on too, but I don't do that so I can't say for sure. Go Pack!"
2,Not happy,Scent in product weakened since prior use.Scent did not stay past 2 days and suppose to stay for at least 2 weeks.
3,very interesting,"the gyroscope is a rare instrument which we use usually,this book interpreted the principle of it ,let people accept it more easily,so i think this book is a successful book for mose people."
5,Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,"Doyle Lawson has put together the best of the best from this group.If you want an uplifting, old time gospel sound this is it. It will surely get your hands to clapp'n."
4,Something is amiss in Suburbia,"Another game I got based on a cheap price and other reviews. The one thing that got me excited though was it's throwback homage to Zombies Ate My Neighbor on the SNES. It's not as good as Zombies, but it's okay and warrants a purchase if you can find it under $10. The graphics are good, but not Great or Next Gen and the controls are pretty decent. So if you are looking for some Zombies ate my Neighbor action on your XBox this is as close as you will get."
2,Despite It's Teen Rating...,"it's still a kid heavy game. Battle system is quite simple. You walk around smashing the buttons to kill bad monsters. Weapon system was a strong point in the game, finding items and creating a weapon out of them. I would avoid this game."
2,Terrible single player action,"I bought this game with some kind of expectations of it being like the classic Zombies ate my neighbors. I was sadly disapointed. I did not play it in multiplayer mode which many have argued is what the game is made for, however the single player was monotonous and boring. The game seemed to be very challenging in places that were probably not intended to be. Poor controls and screen views caused much frustration. Finally, the achievements were ridiculously hard to attain. I plan on selling my game for the one or two dollars I can get for it at game stop."
1,Not Good!,"One of the many interesting points with the Xbox 360 is the amazing detail and graphics the console itself provides. Another is the 3-D effects and the ""go inside the game"" ability.The makers of this game failed miserably to see these reasons as opportunities to make a better game. I honestly think they slapped this one together and threw it on the shelf before anyone had time to tell them just how awful it was! The effects stink, the gameplay is awful, the controls are very difficult to figure out and the players move in awkward and hard to maneuver ways.I played this game for about an hour and had to take some tylenol from the headache. The headache caused by screaming as the screen and looking at my bank balance and wishing I had never purchased this game at all."
3,its ok,to me i like the gaunlet slash fake first person shooter there going for if you dont look at higher than life stuff here you can have some fun hereand the online portion is better than the story to me just playin with 16 people is fun or attacking the monster to see who will survive the longestis fun to me rent it or buy it used not worth buying brandnew but all out killer fun is still to be had here
2,old school gaming,"I rented this title. It's not good. With no reviews up, i figured my 2 cents would help people not buy this. Flawed saving system, unimpressive use of unreal 3 engine, poor controls (four wheeler and billy's shooping cart...), flawed attempt at old-school gaming on 360. The odd thing is, it occurred to me while playing that this game could've been great..."
3,Cheap looking,"If this was for $30, I would say it is a good deal, but for close to $50, I could have done much better with a different brand. Also size was smaller than it should be. My size is 10 and I get 10.5 for comfort, this 10.5 was small, felt more like 9.5 Over all would not recommend. And by the way the picture looks much nicer than the actual shoe."
5,Slave???,"Is it wrong to identify yourself as a slave to God more importantly Jesus? No Way! This book is great at defining what it meant when Jesus said “Follow Me”. I’m still in the process of reading this book, but have loved every moment of it. John Macarthur is a great writer and teacher. Visit ww.gty.org (Grace to You)"
3,Changed...but why so little evidence?,"It's probably a little above the heads of many new Christians, but a very good theological work nontheless.The author makes the case that Christianity should leave some very 'positive' evidences on those who profess to have it, and so it should.The author blames a diluted gospel for the lack of 'spiritual evidences' in the lives of many who profess Christ, yet there are many serious Christians who struggle.The author propagates 'works' (mostly difficulties) as the way to attain spiritual maturity, which is just as bad as 'too much grace'.People are 'saved by grace through faith', the initial work (grace) is accomplished by God. Obviously whatever God does is good so it has to be whatever is coming afterwards (the teachings of men) that is causing all the problems."
5,MacArthur at his best,"This work is for those seeking a deeper and more truth-filled walk with our Lord and our Savior. By clearly unpacking many of Jesus' teachings and parables, MacArthur compares those with many of the current and past arguments for and against these views. It is a humbling journey, no matter which side of the debate you find yourself on, to see how Jesus intended to use His parables and how they have been misinterpreted over the milennia.Jesus' expectation of integrity (matching words/profession of faith with the actions of your daily life) and the reality of what the Apostle's lived out of those, is very clear.May this work help you to understand Him.Grace and Peace."
5,A MUST READ for all who claim Jesus as LORD,This book really put it all toghter for me. As a new believer I intuitively had a problem saying a pray or asking Jesus into my heart and then thinking I am totally saved with out counting the cost or making an life changes. This book refutes that easy believism approach and really explains what a saved follower of Jesus is expected to do or be.A NUST READ FOR ANY SERIOUS CHRISTIAN
4,The good news is the Lord Jesus Christ!,"I enjoyed reading ""The Gospel According to Jesus"". MacArthur does a good job laying out the truth of the gospel. The appendix, the gospel according to the apostles, is a bonus. I did find myself wishing MacArthur would have phrased certain statements better, but overall a work that needs to be read.The bottom line and main point of the book is that you must receive Jesus Christ as everything or you do not receive him at all. You can't pick and choose which or what parts of Jesus you want. Its all or nothing. It's a hard read for those who want a Savior but not a Lord."
4,John MacArthur stands up against antinomianism,"There are people out there that claim that you can be a christian and live exactly the same way (or worse) than an unbeliever. You can become a christian, these people claim, and have no change in your life. John MacArthur refutes these false teachers in his book. The bible commands us in 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 5 to turn away from those that claim that the gospel has no power to change lives (having a form of godliness but denying its power).2 Timothy chapter 3:1 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!"
5,To the point that Spirit filled saints will bring fourth good works which is a mark of true salvation.,It is hard to imagine people could not understand from scripture that the salvation from our Lord Jesus always produces righteous living. If good works did not accompany salvation than did the Holy Spirit fail? Certainly not!!! That wold be insinuating that God is deficient. How Satan has blinded the minds of so many to believe Christ's Lordship is not part of true salvation.
1,Lordship Salvation Theology,I believe that Dr. MacArthur is heavily influenced by Covenant Theology and his position in this book obviously reflects it. Miles J. Standford has gone to be with the Lord but he left us with a good review of this book. Please read Miles J. Stanford's review of this book here:http://withchrist.org/MJS/gospelaccord.pdf
4,Understanding the Word...,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who already has some knowledge of Christ but you want to learn more and go deeper into the Word. This book is a tremendous study help along with having valuable information that's helps saved people with more understanding and unsaved people as to why Jesus Christ is Lord. I believe that you can't learn key aspects of the bible by reading it alone. ""The Gospel According to Jesus"" is an excellent supplement to your studying of the Word. So if you want to ""study to show thyself approved"" this is a must read."
5,The best book ever written on saving faith,"The Gospel According to Jesus is a must read for every Christian. John MacArthur, in his usual easy to read and clear way, hits the central tenet of Christianity, how does an individual inherit eternal life? Many folks, including pastors and other church leaders, believe surrendering to Jesus Christ as Lord is optional for saving faith. They claim all that is necessary is to accept Jesus Christ as Savior and if, later in your life you submit to His Lordship, so much the better. MacArthur, using the words of Christ Himself, shows there is no salvation without a willingness to follow Jesus as Lord. The message of this book is timeless, since it is supported with a plethora of scripture references. I heartily recommend the book to any Christian desiring to communicate the Gospel accurately. This book, along with a companion volume entitled Faith Works (The Gospel According to the Apostles), are indispensible tools in the Lord's work."
3,"Good message, but laborious","This book calls the reader not only to believe in Jesus, but also to *follow* him. That is, you cannot accept Jesus as Savior without accepting him as Lord. MacArthur uses all 304 pp of this text to drive the above point home. This is a good book if you need to be convinced of 'lordship salvation', but if you are already 'on board', you may become bored as MacArthur repeatedly drives home this point based on his interpretation of the Gospel."
5,I loved the book,Great book to read! This exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the Lordship debate. Buy it.
4,"Though a powerful argument, there are weaknesses.","From message preached by Dr. MacArthur:""It's amazing, but a believer can be just as barren and just as fruitless as an unbeliever. And therefore completely indistinguishable from an apostate, an evil doer, a superficial false Christian.""I recommend that those who love and listen to Dr.MacArthur consider that he is not 100 % fullproof in his stance on this subject.See his message ""Remembering what you Know"" from the [...] website."
1,Not only is this book published by antichrist Rupert Murdoch,"but is one bummer trip after another. This kind of misinterpretation of the Gospel is why I was an atheist for most of my life and why I can't stand the Roman Catholic Church into which I was baptized. OMG, if you are a Pastor or hold an office in a church, just glean this book. If you are preaching any of the junk in it, that's where you're going wrong. THIS BOOK WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
1,Anti-Biblical,"It's amazingly sad that this teaching of Lordship Salvation is spreading. John MacArthur tries his hardest in this book to discredit the notion of faith through grace. He develops some ludicrous and unfounded idea that there are different types of grace, and that a true saving grace requires works. The teachings in this book are Pharisee-istic and will only serve a purpose of demolishing the Truth of ""You are Saved By Faith Through Grace"" and the simple reality of John 3:16. MacArthur adds too much, where nothing needs to be added.An amazing book called Absolutely Free! by Zane Hodges is a Biblically intensive reply to this book that will show you what the Bible truly says on the matters that MacArthur distorts. Please check it out."
1,make sure you don't make this book your Gospel,What a legalist!! John MacArthur is just a modern day Pharasie
5,Great book on constructing stories to change behavior,"Humans process information in story form much more accurately and deeply than they do facts, figures and speicifications.And jsut telling someone what to do meets with incredible resistance. David Gordon does a good job of explaining how to deconstruct a situation and identify the crucial aspects, and then shows how to construct a valuable metaphor (story) to provide the desired result.Bravo, David Gordon, I would love to see you write a similar book related to constructing stories for selling."
5,Best Pound Cake Resource I've Found!,This tiny little book is filled with more info on this country's most beloved cake than any other cookbook I've found. It has clear and concise recipes with a cake for every taste. If you love poundcake you have to get this book!
5,You're Gonna Laugh,"These talented guys are a hoot! Their fabulous satires, on-target social commentary and all round good musicianship will win you over. If this doesn't put a smile on your face nothing will."
5,Employee of the Month: Austin Lounge Lizards,"The Austin Lounge Lizards are an eclectic (and that's putting it mildly) and talented band with an uncanny ear for different musical styles, which they lampoon with happy abandon and a great deal of musical skill. Employee of the Month features riffs on genres as varied as hard-core saloon country-western, Beach Boys-style surf music, gospel, Western Swing, Grand Ol' Oprey bluegrass and Leonard Cohen folk. These are not just novelty tunes; they are completely enjoyable in their own right. The writing is clever, the instrumentals are tight and the group's ability to sing close harmony is extraordinary.Any Lizard fan who doesn't own this collection should buy it. If you haven't heard of the group before, buy it anyway... you'll become a fan in no time at all. Let me put it this way: EVERYONE I've shared this album with has bought one. It's that good."
2,Laughable with touches of Brilliance,"I got this in the mail quite mysteriously and put it in the player. From the opening track I was impressed with the humor and the song writing but I must say the quality of the songs quickly degrades. Yeah, there are some gems like ""The Dogs, They Really Miss You"" and my favorite, ""Rocky Byways."" But the remaining songs are a laughable attempt at entertainment. The Minivan song is painful to hear as are many others that have touches of comic brilliance but utterly fail as enjoyable music. My advice: buy the good tracks as MP3s and skip the rest"
2,Not what I thought,"I ordered this book to help inform me of the processes of getting a book or monograph up on the web, marketing, legal issues, etc. WHile it has some of that, it is mostly a writing book. If thats what you need then this is fine, but if you need a book to help you get something already written on the web and sold, there are better choices."
3,OK lense,"This lense it worth what you pay for it. Nothing spectacular, but nothing truly bad about it either. Works fine for what it is. The screw apart macro lense is a nice little bonus, but its performance is just average."
1,dont wast your time,This product is a piece of junk. I thought I could get around paying the high price of the Canon wide angle lense for a cheap low quality lense but I ended up throwing this lense away and paying the big bucks anyway. Don't get a high def camera and expect quality video if your going the use this merkury lense.
2,Please Pay Attention to bad reviews!,I wanted to get a really good durable slip in slide that would last through the summer so I decided this year I was going to spend more money and hopefully get a better product! I read some of the reviews and some said that it would deflate easily but I thought It fit what I was looking for I will give it a try. I got it out of the box inflated it and there was already and defect and small hole. I've only used it 3-4 times and had to patch up atleast 6 holes. I have ran out of patch material! The slip and slide is not made out of durable material so you might as well spend $10 at walmart for one atleast you can afford to replace it more often!
5,Aviva Sports Water Slide,"I got it from the seller quickly, it seems to be made very durable, I have had a lot of fun in the afternoons on it with the kids."
3,It sounds right,"I didn't get my turkey, but it sounded right most of the time. I'm still going to upgrade to a better striker."
1,Absolutely horrible,Got call brand new in package opened it up and conditioned call and striker and the call will not even produce a sound I have many calls but have never had any problems with any other calls this is my first Primos turkey call and I'd say the last as my hunters specialties calls have never had any problems I would recommend looking at another call if you we're thinking about this one
2,"Fairly dull, melodramatic bouncy pop songs.","""Love This Time"" is a little too 1980s-throwback, with way-too-bouncy pop songs backed with zingy synths. Some of the synth-less instrumentals are almost pretty, but Dave Gowans' vocals -- which often border on the spoken-word -- are too serious, too toneless, and too melodramatic. He sounds best when accompanied by one of the album's guest female vocalists, such as fellow Mint artist Carolyn Mark, who joins him on ""Lonely Hearts."" Although they never quite harmonize, her sweet tone balances out his overzealousness.Those who adore jangly, overeager pop songs may find a home for this record, but it's a little too tedious for my liking."
5,Cool sound,Cobra starship has a nice up beat kind of dance beat to it. I really like the whole C.D. it is a nice addition to my collection
5,AWESOME!!,"I LOVE THIS CD, IT IS GREAT FROM START TO FINISH (mostly)....i plan on catching them when they go on tour next month....think it will be great!"
5,Great stuff ever!,"I LOVE this lotion. I've tried several other shave-minimizing lotions and they don't even compare. The Keri does what it says -- moisturizes and makes hair softer, finer and slower growing. I can tell a big difference when I use it consistently. It is thick without being too heavy and has a pleasant scent. This lotion is getting very hard to find. I really hope they don't stop making it."
5,Old Program,This program is no longer sold but Amazon keeps telling me I haven't reviewed it so I will say that it worked fine and gave me an accurate tax return.
3,TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT,"Suave legato, with a hint of informed rubato, gives shape and style to these performances of the Waltzes, but rarely substance, mood or dimension. Unsentimental in approach, Pommier delivers fluid accuracy with cautious charm. There are no extremes here, few titillating eccentricities, and seldom does the artist's spontaneity seem to evolve from the imagination. The suggestion of wisdom is curiously absent, also the requisite subtle melancholy. This is certainly problematic, especially in works as mutable as these. So, although appealing enough, perhaps the playing is just shy of being memorable; however, there are enough felicitous and musical touches to delight, and the recording itself, warmly-lit and attractive, adds intimacy.[Running time: 57:30]"
5,Great clips!,"These work like they're supposed to, which doesn't seem like too much to ask. I'd bought a pair of Apex clips from Big 5 to use at the gym, but they were just a little too small to fit on the gym's bars. I read other reviews on Amazon and found that this is a common problem for various brands. I bought these, and they fit just right!"
1,Doesn't Measure Up,"I have a barbell set I bought back in the 80's but the clamps rusted so I needed replacements. Since everyone's gone to 2"" Olympic size as an industry standard I searched high and low for these, hoping for the best. They're 1"" in the fact that it's the total circumference of the clamp, including the coil. The space between- you know, where'd you'd slide the bar through- is much smaller and doesn't fit either the bar or the dumbbell, and I'm not about to bend them out of shape in an effort to make them fit; I shouldn't have to. Time to return to sender."
4,An Intriguing Mix Of Tom Clancy and Danielle Steele,"Overall, this was a great novel. I found the characters to be human and not models of good and evil, and the plot to be interesting but not far-fetched or overly complicated. The use of the desert as a backdrop for the story was an interesting choice and the descriptions of it were superb.My only problem with the book was the beginning of the story. I found that it was hard to keep straight what was going on and that the flow was not present as it is in the rest of the story. Perhaps, however this was a representation of the story through Lewis' eyes (and since he was drugged up...).Except for that one thing, I loved the book. .... Definately a good read for anyone on vacation."
1,There are better books out there!,"I read this book to my daughter the first time the other night, after it was purchased for her by her grandmother. The book itself is nothing special. The illustrations are cute, but I was bothered by not knowing who ""Big Bear"" was. But what bothered me the most is that after causing chaos around the house, Big Bear gets ""told off"" by Mother Bear. When I read that I paused and re-read it, just to make sure I had read it correctly. I don't want my 2.5 year old daughter ""telling people off,"" and I don't think its appropriate language for a childrens' book. I realize after reading other reviews that the author is British, and maybe it has a different connotation in other countries, but i think that's something the publisher should have caught."
4,Great buy,Great buy for the price and shipment was on time. The book arrived in the condition described.
5,!! ANOINTED!!,I NEVER KNOW WHO THIS MAN WITH THE BIG VOICE WAS UNTIL HE CAME TO MY CHURCH FOR OUR FIRST ANNUAL WORKSHOP. TRULY THE YOUNG MAN IS ANOITED AND VERY INSPIRATIONAL. AFTER HEARING HIM AND ACTUALLY TALKING TO HIM HE IS A TRUE MAN OF GOD AND WE WERE BLEST TO HAVE HIM IN OUR MIST....
2,I do not know if iti works...,I think Mucinex works better. You have to take 4 big pills a day. I will not be taking it anymore.
5,Gingerbreads,We made wonderful suckers on a stick! The kids love it! I would buy them again next time around. Kathy Dixon
4,Revolutionary book about loneliness,"This book is downright heretical. That's probably why it's out of print now (a paperback edition is *supposedly* imminent). It not only challenges almost everything we've been told about loneliness and couplehood (like that if you don't have the latter you'll surely have the former) but it lays out a plan for not just surviving but flourishing by oneself, without lapsing into cloying me-ism as self-help books have a habit of doing. Highly recommended (Get this book back in print!!)."
5,Very powerful and interesting book,A rare piece of work.Would love to exchange ideas on the subject w/other readers.Please feel free to E-Mail me.
5,Subject material,This book is quite helpful and will get the beginner started properly on propagating plantsfrom test tubes. Well written and easy to follow. Book also came to me from seller in excellent conditionfor 'slightly used' TY
4,Great overview,"This book is a great in depth, while still basic, introduction to the subject. Coming from a very non-scientific background and knowing little about propagating plants in any method this book was great in explaining in detail, but in ways I understood. But I wish that the explanations for mixing mediums could have been made a bit more clear for other non-chemists like me."
5,Magnificent Marriage,Thank you for propmpt shipping and the book is wonderful! Excellent all the way around!
2,My X-boyfriend,"Considering that one of the plasmic honey producers is my Xboyfriend and the song has spunk, although its not there best i give them 2 stars... DONNA"
4,Remember Sky King?,"Remember the original action/adventure TV series, Sky King? Sky King, played by Kirby Grant, was a flying cowboy. The series, which ran, off and on, from 1951 to 1962 was sponsored by Peter Pan peanut butter. If you can remember that show then you'll probably recall seeing some of the bizarre creations, entertainingly explained, found in the Gallery of Regrettable Food. What's truly scary is, you might recognize one of the cookbooks and realize you may have actually consumed one of these preposterous, unappetizing creations. Even if you don't remember good old Sky and his daughter Penny, you'll be amazed that any of us ever survived the culinary delights of yesteryear, and you'll get a good laugh to boot."
4,Doesn't Make My Mouth Water,It's a wonder that any of these recipes were published in the first place - particularly with the very unappetizing photos that accompanied them. Having this book on hand is a great laugh at current dinner parties - sure to make any cook look good in comparison!
5,How lucky we are...,"There are plenty of history books about the 1950's. But to get the real feel of that era, take a gander at this book!Not only is the text entertaining-- the pictures are just too horrid to describe. The fact that these were the mainstream, approved, and regaled foodstuffs of the 1950's says more about the time than any dry recitation of historical facts. One look at the ""meat pie, with a meat crust"" says more about the life and times than a dumpster full of NY Times front pages.Lilek's running commentary is hilarious and merciful counterpoint to the gloppy and gory illustrations.There's at least one cringe, shudder, or guffaw per page!"
2,Beautiful photos spoiled by annoying text,"Lileks assembles an amazing photographic journey through surreal looking edibles, in their all of their imperfectly color-matched glory, and then undercuts any sense of fun with contempt-filled, ostensibly ""hip"" commentary. The text isn't even amusing for those who like that kind of humor. Authors like Jane and Michael Stern can take this kind of subject and roll with it, delighting in the joys of ""cholesterol baroque"" (case in point: Lileks just dismissingly makes fun of the ""weird"" idea of cooking with 7-up, while the Sterns in several publications give recipes, tips and history behind this unique culinary adventure). Lileks, on the other hand, seems content to say ""doesn't this look gross!"" over - and over - and over. I bought it for the incredible pictures though. Maybe I should have just gone to the used bookstore and picked up some original four-color brochures!"
1,A regrettable purchase,"Totally disappointing. While some of the pictures are wonderfully unappetizing, his ""humorous"" text is just annoying. It was like having a not-at-all clever person looking over my shoulder making stupid comments. I just wanted him to stop! Including the recipes would have been _much_ funnier. At least it inspired me to go out and buy vintage cookbooks. I don't need someone to tell me why it's funny."
1,Extraordinarily mean-spirited book,"What an extraordinarily mean-spirited book. What could have been a light hearted nostalgic look at American culinary culture in the 1950s comes off as a rather nasty, unfunny sneer at ordinary middle class people and the food they ate. The reproductions of the advertisements are of a deliberately poor quality and are then lambasted for the funny colors. One would suppose that the color quality of a fifty year old magazine advertisement might suffer over time. This books leaves a bad taste in your mount in more than one way."
4,Odd humor.,"Sometimes funny, sometimes not, but always frightening. The Gallery of Regretable Food is an interesting look at the history of The Bad Idea.From shaped meat, to bizarre beverages, this book is at the very least bizarre enough to look all the way through. Amazing what a culture inevitably spawns."
4,Funny stuff - not for kids,"I orginally got this book for my 12yo sister in law. After reading through a few chapters there is no way I can give this to her. The book mentions drinking until throwing up, marijuana and carrying on. Certainly not the gift I thought it was. Still, I bet my pops will love it."
2,Disappointed,"James Lileks is a very funny man. I've followed his writing since he wrote for the student newspaper at the University of Minnesota. He currently writes a great column for a poor newspaper in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He has one of the best humor websites anywhere on the web, so I was primed for another great work. This book just isn't up to his high standards. I think it is too long with too much material to comment on and not enough variety in his descriptions. James usually can think of many different ways to look at a subject. He finds suggestions of ideas in the background of a picture that are usually hilarious. In this book, he comes up with the same observations too often. I would guess he was under pressure to finish it and make it a long book resulting in less than his best work. I really wanted to like it."
1,The Gallery of Regrettable Food,"I looked forward to this book because of the old recipes, and curious about what the title implied.I was very disappointed and thought that the vulgar language was unnecessary in a ""review"" of old cook books.The old time recipes, jello salads and casseroles were from my mothers' era. It could have been an excellent book had the author kept the language decent.Mary Pichette"
3,"Laugh if you want, but.....","keep in mind, overweight and obesity were RARE during this time of our American history at the time these ""boring, unspicy, meatfilled"" recipes were served. These are not bad recipes, (well some are), but they are not expensive or complicated. Things like soda pop, burgers, pizza and even spagetti was considered a ""treat"", back then, not regular fare.Thank god today we live in a world of soda pop at dinner, tofu, falafel, fast food, and veggie burgers, eaten by overstressed, over worked yuppies. Life is so much better now. lol."
5,This book is so funny it injured me,"I was suffering from pneumonia when I first saw this material on the lileks web site. I was laughing so hard I tore my rib muscles and had to endure further suffering. It was all worth it! This is some of the finest comedy I have ever seen. Check out the look inside feature to gets a glimpse of what you could be having and go to the lileks web site to get some more, and definately BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Hilarious from page 1,"I have the feeling that Lileks could write about garden grubs with the same caustic wit and humor. It's really all about his writing in my opinion. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole book, but you either appreciate this kind of thing, or not. I would love to see Lileks and Lewis Black on stage together - major insightful irreverance."
5,How to laugh so hard your gut splits open,I read a bunch of this on-line and put a link to it from my web page. It is just so funny!I went out an bought it and now give it as a gift to people I really like. I re-read it once when I was depressed and I wasn't depressed anymore. BETTER THAN DRUGS!!!
5,Bravado and the Perky Frankfurter Unite!,"Oh, this book is truly proof of the old proverb ""Bad taste costs no more."" First, it contains full color photos of such food oddities as perky frankfurters in a bean casserole. Secondly, the commentary will have you gurgling on the floor of the shuttle bus, er, or wherever else you might be reading this ... It sees my favorite era (for food, fashion, appliance colors, etc.) in an acid light and its humor is such that I would like to lunch with Mr. Lileks at once. Bravo!"
5,The Real Reason Why Godzilla Perished....,"This book is a hilarious reminder of some of the less than sumptuous dishes I saw my mother, grandmothers, aunts and family friends ""prepare"" way back when I was a child.... It is a cruel reminder that we are all carbon based lifeforms and as such could be fed any number of these messes masquarading as food and were expected to and did in fact live to tell about it.... This book is hilarious..."
4,Very discreet camera bag,"I recently purchased this bag so I can carry my DSLR discreetly. It's a very well constructed and handsome bag - the canvas and leather are very durable. It has a removable padded sleeve to keep your camera safe from the elements and any bumping. Best of all,it doesn't look like a camera bag and can double as a nice looking brief case. I would have given it 5 stars but the bag is a bit small / slim and doesn't have separate sections for the lens (they can bump into each other). The bag seemed too small for my Sony A700 with vertical grip and zoom lens. It does fit and look ok if I just have my 50mm attached.Overall, I would recommend this bag to anyone who has a small slr and wants to walk around without looking like a tourist.Pros: Well made, beautiful appearance, waterproof, and doesn't look like a camera bag.Cons: Small, slim, and doesn't have lens inserts.Recommend: Yes, for small SLR cameras."
3,"Good bag, but expensive & looks a bit too 'purse' like","This is a highly functional and comfortable camera bag.My complaint about it is the high price and the fact that it tends to draw attention to itself while you are wearing it.It fits in in an upper-scale environment however walking around 'normal' city streets with it, I feel like everyone is noticing the nice camera bag. Also, it's a bit to purse-like for my liking.I instead purchased theDomke 701-83S F-803 Camera Satchel (Sand), which I'm quite happy with as it costs half as much and looks more low-key."
4,Gets the job done!,"I use this amp in a church setting with about 200 people every Sunday. Granted I'm DI'd into the monitor and house mix. You will need a DI box if you're going to play live. There is no direct out (XLR). It has plenty of punch and I never have it louder than '4' on the volume. The presets are nice as you can immediately change tone if needed. There is a bit of a high end hiss that I'm not too fond of, but I run and MXR 10 band EQ inline with it and it has done the job! It holds its own with the drum kit and other guitarists on stage."
5,This is my favorite science series,"I love NOVA. This is even better. Outstanding audio, video and Brian is a natural instructor. This video is at a very good level of detail. It isn't over simplified for the general public like so many Science Channel shows. Brian's accent is pleasant and the audio is well done. He has a calm delivery that fits well with the subject. This series has the best cinematography I've seen. He travels all over the natural world for this show. It is certainly five stars."
5,"Great For Visualizing The ""Big Picture"" of The Universe","Being a mathetician as well as studying physics and being an amateur astronomer, I will say that I didn't learn any new information from the series, but I did realize different and wonderful ways of visualizing the universe and several physical and chemical processes that I found enlightening and enjoyable. The series also made these scientific topics very artistic and majestic. I've always loved the science, but the series gave me a deeper appreciation of the artistry of nature. I've also read Brian Cox's books and watched the Wonders of the Solar System and loved them all, but my personal favorite would be the Wonders of the Universe. I personally have always been a fan of Carl Sagan's Cosmos since that was originally inspired my love for astronomy at a young age, I would have to say that I think modern audiences would prefer the Wonders of the Universe since the Cosmos series would be viewed as dated by a younger audience."
5,Best Cosmology Teacher EVER!,"This is the finest, most clear, most inspiring cosmology education experience I have ever had. That's saying a lot, since I am a lifetime-consumer and seeker of science education. It is impossible for me to over-recommend this brilliant educational series. I also previously viewed Brian Cox's 'Wonders of the Solar System,' which is also fabulous. I don't agree that 'Wonders of the Universe' is just a follow-up to 'Wonders of the Solar System.' Rather, it is a 'stand-alone' program which needs no other to make it complete. Don't miss this program, for no matter what your educational background is, you will understand what Brian Cox teaches in this 'Wonders of the Universe' series. And in understanding it, it will change you and lead you to a more positive experience of being alive. I wish EVERYONE who speaks English would view this series!"
2,Twee dumb tedium.,"Love Cox's books, but this documentary series has him looking like he's stoned and spoon-feeding pabulum to what he must assume are the dimmest people on the planet, while leaving behind an ENORMOUS and wholly unnecessary carbon footprint. I can't recall having learned one thing from this series, and Cox actually takes a trip to some South American mountaintop to show us what steam (from hot springs) turning to ice crystals on cold rocks looks like.Cox is a natural ally (we share a distaste for superstition and both love natural wonders), and as I said, I like his books very much. ""Wonders"" is twee, it is dumbed down science rather than popular science, and as a result, despite taking us to several exotic locations as a distraction, it is dull."
5,great series... im a big cosmos carl sagan fan and this was a nice watch,"i do agree with some other reviews here, Brian Cox seems to be a little bit more pessimistic about the ""arrow of time"" i mean lets face it, no one really knows, there could be an infinite cycle of big bangs continuing through an infinite space, it just seems to me with his time claims he really didnt back it up with exact proof, however i agree with another reviewer here that Gravity is by far the best episode on this disc, it is excellent. i also enjoyed stardust, that episode will be nice for a date night since its all ooooo we are made out of stardust how cute... lol"
1,Childish Imitation of A Masterpiece,"A great deal of money was spent, and wasted, sending the very young Mr. Cox to exotic locales so he could play with rocks, look longingly to the heavens, and intone platitudes. The Discovery Channel effect, CGI and oh-so-clever camera tricks substituted for oh-so-boring facts, is rampant here. Apparently nobody at the BBC remembers a certain other series, created a few decades ago, that covered all this and much, much more. Mr. Cox's earnest, straight-faced proclamation that ""we are all part of the universe"" makes me incredulous that an organisation (note spelling) as buttoned-up as the BBC can produce such twaddle; I thought only the Discovery stable of dizzy producers could do something like this. I would rather re-watch ""Cosmos"" on VHS on a old 19 inch Trintron than waste time and disgust on this ""My Weekly Reader"" with lots-o-money on a high-end plasma. ""Cosmos"" is the enduring standard, and this is childish and unworthy of the BBC."
2,"Some good images, pity about the presenter!","Brian Cox is not a David Attenborough.However if the image of a boy band member gushing and ""oohing"" over every half-decent imagery floats your boat ..."
1,Boring,"I fell asleep watching each episode, and that's not hyperbole. This series seems to be made for the tiny audience of people who are both completely ignorant of modern astronomy and physics and yet interested enough to watch Brian Cox aw shucks his way across the world, not so much teaching science as trying to impart religious-like awe toward the universe. That shtick gets old very fast."
1,Drivel and endless ego.,"This is the first ""science"" dvd I ever bought that I can say that I truly hate. This Brian Cox character believes himself to be some sort of great philosopher who can find ways to spend thousands of words to say that things that could simply be stated in ten. No matter how many times I try to get through this video, I cannot make it. I want to just scream as I hear him emphasizing every second or third syllable, believing himself to be some gifted orator. I love videos about science and physics, but this one is so damned boring and annoying and simplistic that I cannot possibly see how anyone can give it more than one star. Save your money. This is unquestionably the worst science BluRay/DVD I have ever purchased."
4,Entertaining for the first in a new series,"I loved it! It had an array of unique characters, good hot sex, variety of action and intrigue, overall really good! Each book in the series seems to outdo the last one!She (werewolf) works for the guardians (though she doesn't really want to be a guardian) with her brother (who is part vampire), and fights crime and hunts down criminals. Yeah, and the criminals tend to be vampires, werewolves, shape-shifters, and non-humans.Plus she's trying to lead a normal, and find a guy to have a relationship with, maybe have a kid...as long as he doesn't mind sharing her when the moon is full.."
4,I like this new series.,"I liked this new Riley Jenson series. She is half werewolf, half vampire as is her twin brother Rhoan. Rhoan is a guardian for the Directorate, and Riley is an assistant guardian. Guardians are disappearing. Rhoan falls victim also, and Riley must find him. I liked the character Riley, she is very tough, funny, down to earth except when the moon is rising and then her werewolf beast must be sastisfied by having lots of sex with her designated lovers. The plot was good, plenty of action, great secondary characters that will surely continue on into the next books in this series. The sex became a little reminiscent of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake and her ardeur. But, not near as graphic, or as much. Thank goodness or I would have to stop reading this series, if it falls prey to being all the book is about. Otherwise, I enjoyed it, and will read the next books."
1,"Terrible plot, no romance and just plain boring.","Riley Jenson is not much of heroine. Before she fights bad guys, she has to have sex. Then instead of fighting the bad guys, she has sex with them. After having sex with them, she wants more sex. She spends a lot of her time in dance clubs having sex. The author writes good erotic scenes but nothing else. The plot is terrible. There is no romance in this book, either. No one loves Riley, people just want to use her and she lets them, over and over. I am not going to read another book in this series and I probably will not read another one written by this author, either. I would recommend authors Kim Harrison and Karen Chance instead."
3,"Short, fun, enjoyable, nothing special.","As many others have said, this book might have been more enjoyable if the main character wasn't in heat throughout the entire book. The constant need for the main character to have sex made her a little unlikeable. However, there is a good mystery presented here, some betrayal, and a few twists and turns. Overall a quick enjoyable read, but the characters lacked the depth to make this novel anything special. I enjoyed the book and will continue reading the series, even if just to see if Riley is a better character when not in heat."
4,Good series,"The 1st in the Riley Jenson series. Good book, but with quite a few sex scenes. Although it fits with the book and the character. It is not a mushy romance novel. There is a little bit of a mystery in the book. Overall a good sci-fi/fantasy read."
4,Really good book.,I really liked the story. So much in fact I've purchased the second book in the series.
2,"Romance novel, starring vampires & werewolves","OK, I do love vampires & werewolves...but I have to admit I didn't know that this was a romance novel. I was reading it on the plane on my Kindle when I came to the first sex scene and actually found myself reducing the font size and skipping pages because it was not what I thought it would be."
1,chris,"I love horror novels and was looking forward to a cool werewolf/vampire book. The premise is pretty good but the non-stop sexual references and way too graphic sex scenes are completely unnecessary. Why can't anyone write a good hooror novel about werewolves, vampires etc. without the sex? I quit reading at page 80 or so, and I won't bother to finish it!"
2,"Good premise, poor execution","Well, it's all been said. There's sex but personally, I didn't find it very erotic or hot. The book ended up irritating me because I really wanted to like it but I just don't think I can be bothered reading the rest of the series now (esp. after reading the reviews). The whole thing was just very flat for me."
2,For resuing plot from her other series (Spook Squad and bit of another).,"Now I know why Ms. Arthur said she wouldn't be finishing the Spook Squad series (which would be nice to have an ending).I don't think this would have bothered me as much if I had been for warned and I would have bought the book used. Though, I most likely would have skipped this book and started later in the series.Over all the book was OK. Even though I would like an end to ""Spook Squad"", I'm not sure if I will or won't read more of this series. I don't care for crude sex with multiple - partners."
4,seriously above average.,"It's a spy novel! No, it's a smokin' hot romance! No, it's a Vampires and Werewolves novel! No, it's ALL of the above, in one tidy package!Loads of adventure, loads of paranormal workd-build-hints, and stonkin' big heaps of great sex with none of the hang-ups and ""oooh, I'm such a bad bad girl, I'm so deadly and I hate it"" that have made Laurel K Hamilton's Anita Blake series such a boring read lately. It's sort of a mish-mash of some of the other books I've read, but since it's done better than most of them I'm not objecting. Plus, it takes place in Australia, so how cool is that?"
2,Theres a Plot somewhere...,"I'm sorry but I thought this book was horrible. If someone asked me what this book was about all I could probably tell them was sex. All the characters wanted was sex SEX SEX. The story line was so buried beneath it all, it was just ridiculous. The only reason I gave the book two stars was because the others description was fairly good. This book is a long way from the Anita Blake Series which actually has a face paced storyline, and characters that have developed personalities..."
2,not good enough to read book 2,I downloaded this book to the Kindle because it was free and the book description looked interesting. I wish that the description had listed it in the horror/erotica genre so I wold have known to pass on it. I'm not sure if the book was supposed to be set in the future or the present so it was difficult for me to wrap my head around the technology that was used in the book. The concept was interesting but not good enough to make me buy the second book. I'm not really into the horror/erotica genre as I find it typically boring. It is an over used concept and usually (Keri Arthur being no exception) can pull off neither topic very well.
3,Full Moon Raping,"I read this as a free Kindle release. There were a lot of good points about the book - nice characterization, interesting setting, good plot points - but can I just say WHAT'S WITH ALL THE RAPE?Pretty early, a character finds herself drugged and wakes up while her boyfriend having sex with her. This happens again, later in the book. What was REALLY odd is that the only thing the author actually refers to as rape is something that MIGHT have happened, but didn't. WTF.I think I get where the author was going with the whole 'werewolves are free with their bodies' things and maybe trying to channel a Kushiel's Dart thing where even the bad sex is sex. It's still rape in my book.Other than the excessive rape, the only downside (for me) is that the character is clearly going to be all about sex every full moon (I wonder when the books will take place?) and Anita Blake frankly wore me out on the hypersexualized protag thing."
4,Love the Guardian Series,"I came upon this book as an audio download and loved it. I started out with all things vamp in the paranormal world and I was surprisingly pleased to find Riley was half vamp and half wolf. She is a sexy, spunky, female who knows how to [...]. The characters are very likable and range from shifters and various other cool creations that you will discover in the 2nd book (don't want to give anything away). There is tons of action, humor, and romance. Some of the romantic details are a bit risque but it is a very good read. I am on the 7th book in the series and I have enjoyed them all. If your looking for a new series to read then the Guardian Series would be a great choice."
3,It's a maybe,"I felt this book was OK, but has the potential to make a good series. I am a Kim Harrison and Charlaine Harris fan. I used to be a LKH (Anita Blake) fan until her books became all about sex. Therefore, I may have been unfairly biased against this book since everytime sex scenes arose, I was reminded of the Anita Blake series and was turned off. I am withholding final judgement tho, until I read book 2."
3,Excellent,Wonderful read. Nice mix of Werewolf and Vampire. Suspense and romance with a smart character. Can't wait for the next one.
2,okay,"It was worth the price.But it was too full of wild sex that was always the best ever, after a while i got tired of always reading about the best ever. Nothing original there. The story line wasn't new either, just packaged differently.I did like the hybrid concept though.I did care enough to finish the book, but I'm not sure that I'd bother with any more of the series"
5,SExy!,"This book was wonderful and inspiring. I must say It sparked some intrest with my husband. What's better than werewolfs, vampires and sex?"
3,*DISAPPOINTED*,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET INTO THE RILEY JENSEN SERIES. BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FIRST BOOK...BORING, NOT ENOUGH SEX AND JUMPS AROUND QUITE A BIT. I AM GOING TO READ THE NEXT BOOK JUST TO GIVE KERI ARTHUR A FAIR SHAKE."
1,Dreadful,"The story could be interesting, but the writing is very disappointing. The sex scenes are just *awful*, and the pacing is off. Save your money - this is another author trying to cash in on the sex-and-supernatural trend."
1,Stab it with a silver plated wood stake through the heart...please!,"Took a risk coming to this from my typical sf/fantasy reads because I loved the Anne Rice vampire novels. Needless to say this is a literal waste of time. No character development, no...well I could go on, I realize...believe me there isn't much of anything in here - it reads like a late late late night soft porn it's so dark I can't see anything that's happening made for tv movie.Someone must be reading this because I see there are sequels, but if you take your reading the slightest bit seriously, leave this one alone."
1,Nothing new here...move along please....,"I picked up 'Full Moon Rising' on a lark as I was searching for new authors in the genre and I was hoping for a read like Patricia Briggs or Carrie Vaughn. What Keri Arthur delivers is a paranormal romance plain and simple. If that is what you like then read this book. If you prefer urban fantasy then go with the other two authors mentioned above.I found I really didn't care about or identify with Riley's predicament or life and I've read better sex (and better plots) in other books. I have skimmed the other books in this series and I have to say that they are just the same.Again, if you are a paranormal romance reader (Feehan, Krinard, or the like) then you'll probably enjoy this series."
2,Promising but flawed,"Keri Arthur's preternatural romance looked fairly good when I downloaded the sample but proved disappointing. While I enjoyed the characters and the plot-line, Arthur had problems with pacing. There are several way too long conversations to explain the labyrinthine plot by the bad guys--too many details that are not necessary to enjoy the story. Then she had some way too long action sequences. What was needed were the enaction of plot twists--conversation and breakdown of fight sequences need to be sparingly used.I liked the more paranormal less romance part of this book since I didn't realize it was billed as a romance. (I bought it thru Kindle which does not provide much description of the books). I could have done without the numerous descriptions of the main characters libido level-tiresome after a while.With stringent re-writing and/or editing I think Arthur could be a fairly good author."
2,"Entertaining, but extremely flat","I have this thing, that any book I start reading, I will finish. Sometimes books start off kind of weak and become much better in the end. With this book it was almost the opposite. In the beginning I was intruiged, as I had no idea, what I started to read. The reason I got the book, was it's price - free on Kindle is hard to beat. The beginning, with it's introduction to a world of werewolves and vampires was interesting. Unfortunately after that, the book began to lose a lot of it's appeal. I don't mind the sex, but the scenes became so repetitive and unerotic that I started to skip them, because I knew those were adding nothing to the story.The characters in the story are not very interesting. As an example - careful spoiler - it's explained that the vampires have a hacking order based on age. This book has the top 3 in it. Does that really make sense?"
2,Bodice Ripper Meets Letters to Girlie Magazine,"As a romance novel or script for a porn flick...this one rips bodices and leaves only threads behind! As a science fiction novel, we finally did get to a story line, but it took a long time. I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but I started scanning ahead and skipping them after a while (*yawn*). Other fertile opportunities for word-smithing end up just sitting there. For example, shifting into wolf form is never really described, it just suddenly happens, being given about as much attention as walking through a door. The author never even really describes *what* her werewolves look like. That sort of thing should be as full of sensory descriptions as other scenes. The following books in the series may get better, but they aren't on my ""to buy"" list."
2,Fast paced? NOT,"I finally decided to give up on this book 3/4 of the way through. And that was at least 1/4 too much. There is a plot somewhere in here, it's just constantly interrupted with 4-5 pages of soft porn. And that's too bad; it would be a fun read otherwise, and she's not so bad a writer. But is was just taking waaaay to long to get anywhere. Maybe she doesn't know how to produce something of worth so she fills it up with sex. I don't read romances, maybe this is what they are all about. Call me silly, but I read to get a good story."
4,Review: Full Moon Rising,"The hero and the heroine are interesting characters, they are believable. Quinn, the sexy vampire hero is everything you could ask for. Riley the independent and very kick-ass heroine though she is feisty and very Buffy, she still remains feminine and vulnerable. Though she is not human. She is a vampire / werewolf mix.Full of twists and turns, you have to really read it attentively or else you will lose what's going on. The mystery is so good, that you won't even see it resolved at the end of this first book, there will be a lot of loose ends that will make you want to grab the 2nd and 3rd,etc. volumes of the series and just read on to discover what is going to happen. I am going to be reading the rest of this series. I haven't got the 2nd book yet. But I will be reading it soon.This book is really for the maturer audience. The sex scenes are... very well did :) I'll leave that at that!!"
2,Interesting read,"I've read this series up to book 4,and decided not to continue.The premise is interesting,using science with werewolves and vampires and great sex,but I just found myself getting bored with the main character and personally,I just wish the author had made lesser books to get the point across."
4,Not quite the genre of Anita Blake but not a bad thing...,"If you are a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton, then chances are you will enjoy this book. Yes it's vampires again but with a vamp/werewolf twist. This is more a lightweight novel than what we get from Hamilton but Riley (our were-heroine)is rougher around the edges if possible and is under the effect of a rising moon, full mating season for werewolfs in this series. The action is fairly fast-paced and it is hard to tell at times who you can trust in Riley's life. The one down-side is Riley's constant assessment of her next sex partner when it's obvious who she really wants. Still, I do recommend it for a different kind of turn on the werewolf/vamp genre."
5,Who Wouldn't Want To Be A Wolf???,After reading this first book I can not wait to read the rest of the series. This book is steaming hot! I could not put it down. I will let you know what I think when I finish the next book.
3,Potentially interesting debut but not quite as imaginative as it seems...,"I won't belabor the book and plot description. If you want a plotline, look at Harriet Klausner's review.True, there's nothing new under the sun, but ""Full Moon Rising"" takes a very similar line to one in Charlaine Harris' novels (e.g. having to deal with a naked vampire with amnesia) and does not handle the storyline near as well.On the other hand, her erotica is more consensual and less demeaning than Laurell K. Hamilton's. The sex is a fun romp and worth reading if that's what you're reading this type of novel for.Both Riley and the world they live in, are interesting and fun enough to give another try, despite some misgivings."
3,"Good story, but too much sex . . .","I think the story was interesting, and I liked heroine Riley, but she spent too much time ""in-heat"", and it was a little hard to get into the story because so much time was spent on the sex. I like a story with attraction and heat and lust, and yes even some sex on occasion, but this almost got boring. The story did keep me interested enough to care how it ended, and I will read the next one - I just hope we can get into the story a little more and leave a few things to the imagination!"
2,"Vampires and Werewolfs ,Oh my","After reading a few pages of Full Moon Rising my reaction was ""What utter rubbish"" But as I continued on, I began to realize that it was a well written story even if it was in a genre that I was not familiar with. Riley Jenson and her twin brother Rhoan are Dhampires, part wolf and part vampire,born of a wolf who was raped by a vampire within an hour of its emerging from the grave.This appears to give them great powers,with the ability to change from wolf to human form at will. It also gives them a lust for sex that grows stronger as the moon gets closer to full. This lust makes for some very graphic sex scenes which leave very little to the imagination.I doubt very much that I will seek out more books of this type although it was an eye opening experience."
2,Not a Romance novel,"This is not a Romance novel and am disappointed that it is classified as such. The writer's plot is confusing and although I fell in love with Vampire Quinn, I was disappointed that the romance never went anywhere then sex. It also got tiring to keep reading Riley's defense against wolves being classified as sluts or prostitutes especially when she behaved as such. She had sex with anything that moved and it was not what I was looking for at all. The writer would have done better to expand on the vampire romance, but from reading reviews on the other 6 books Riley's list of lovers keeps getting longer..."
2,I put it down pretty quickly.,"Honestly, I didn't really care for the heroine's unabashed promiscuity. Paranormal or no, it *is* supposed to be a romance. Perhaps, in the end the hero was the only one scratching her itch, but alas I couldn't endure until then. If you like that kinda thing...sure, fine, whatever...read and enjoy, but I'm not a fan."
5,Full Moon Rising-yee haw!,"I had never heard of Keri Arthur, and hard up for book to read, I grabbed this one, and very pleased I did so. It's a good romp, excellent alternative world structure, and enough openings for sequels. I'm a big fan of LKH, Jim Butcher, Tanya Huff, et al, and I would put Keri in that group. Hopefully, she won't take three books to start maturing the main character like LKH did, and which Jim Butcher has yet to do (though I still like his books). All in all, I wasn't a bit disappointed. If you need some lovely mind candy, here you go!"
5,"Another great from... you guessed it, David Pogue","I live this book! Thanks David and Joe! You guys are the best! As always, another great update. It's hard to believe how far we moved in these 2 years. An innovative idea is the six free chapters online! I LOVE the contest, but I may be biased about that... I won this year! Wow!Jason"
1,warning! No OS 8 or G3 info in this version!,"I am a loyal reader of the authors of this book and own previous editions. However, the label ""includes coverage of Mac OS 8"" was misleading. ""Coverage"" means in this case a short preview of the Copland version, which is NOT on my or any other machine. Therefore, I do not know which of the Secrets described in this book apply to my system, which makes the entire thing useless. Finally, the CD included seems very difficult for my Mac G3 to operate, I assume because of a conflict with a feature OS 8. This purchase was a great dissappointment. If you own a G3 or use system 8.0 or later, wait for the next edition."
3,Good sources; moderate usefulness,"This work gives the fundamental surviving sources for our knowledge of music theory among the ancients and medieval writers. Students of musicological history will no doubt find them invaluable.Unfortunately for those who might wish to derive musical practice from these writings, there is little fodder for the working musician here. These are indeed writings on music theory as it was understood in ancient and medieval days, not writings about musical practice in those days."
3,You've seen the movie....,"The movie version of this came out long before the book...""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". It's the story of a hard-boiled cop versus killer zombies led by a brilliant, but insane, psychiatrist. Unlike most of his other books, Ellroy reveals who the bad guy is up-front and makes him a major character. This works pretty well and surprises then come from the supporting cast. However, the dialog is not as crisp as his later books, which I would recommend over this one"
2,I really didn't care for it.,"I once heard a bastardization of a Truman Capote comment: ""Writers go through three phases: Learning their craft, writing their best work and typing for money. Try to avoid the first and third."" I read Ellroy's LA Quartet first, and would recommend White Jazz, LA Confidential, American Tabloid and the Big Nowhere to anyone; all were 9s or 10s. All were written at Ellroy's peak.This book was a disappointment in the extreme; it was fairly mechanical; I couldn't even get through it. Rather than this book, look at his aforementioned novels; you won't get better noir writing."
3,"Varese, ahead of his time","This is an excellant collection of Edgard Varese's work. This collections my favorite Varese composition "" Hyperprism."" Varese in his day was far ahead of his time because his music today is still trail blazing in nature. Everyone who is interested in avant garde music should buy this cd immediatly. No classical collection is complete without it."
1,Bill Blass Amazing Fragrance,I dont know if i recieved a bad bach but this smells like nail polish remover. I would not recommend this product at all.
2,INCONFORMIDAD,UNFORTUNATELY GOOD AFTERNOON SERVICE PROVIDED AS A BAD OFFER SOMETHING YOU DO NOT HAVE TO STOP. AT LEAST money back.
2,Soapy,"This is a soap opera that either wants to be literature, or was marketed as literature. It's a romance novel. Many people over a period of many years fall in love, get married, have affairs, grow up, grow old, and have children of their own. Though the characters are scientists, their crushes and affairs are no different from any others' (the book jacket says it's about ""inner lives of smart people""). Regrets are a large part of their lives, though only one or two characters are well-drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy, and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to. Large editing problems render this clearly a first novel, though I give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it."
4,"Thinking about you, just not talking to you","Highly intelligent friends and lovers meet at 6 year intervals that coincide with the waxing and waning of a comet that one of them has discovered. I enjoyed the authors method of tying astronomical and human behavior and his philosophical insights of both. What bothered me is the characters behave too much like the orbiting bodies they study, circling each other but not communicating. I know that is the point of it but it was just to much to be believed. This thoughtful, intelligent novel of life, love and astronomy is worth the read."
5,This is Quannum Quality,"This album is the pinical of quannum quality, and I love em all. Gab, pigeon john,lyrics born, latryx, blackalicious, aspci, g elec, so on. I can see how some might see a few of the tracks as weak, but know that I disagree. People have higher expectations of concious rappers (as they should) but when they throw out a few fun tracks, like ""dont stop"" (which I feal has a positive message, although not political) people dismiss them as ""duds"". Enjoy the music!!! Enoy Xcel! This cat dominates as much if not more on this album. As far as Lateef.. you would be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable mc. Don't be suprised if he plays a bigger role in the next Blackalicious album, or drops another Maroons album that surpasses this one."
3,Good but not for me.,"I can see why people really enjoy this album. Its well produced and has good flow. But there's a quality to the delivery that is distracting to me. Its the same problem i have with Jurassic 5. I think its safe to say that if you like J5 grab this, you'll like it. But if you find them curiously annoying you will find this album annoying in the same way."
3,Could be better,"Radio controlled calibration calibrates the time nearly every night (some nights it does not get a signal, but the next night always works), so the time is always right. The battery is solar charged (technically, if it was solar POWERED you would not have any power if there was not enough sunlight). It has 4 daily alarms, but only one has a snooze on it. It also has no countdown timer. It will give you sunrise and sunset times every day of the year, once you enter your time zone and latitude and longitude. Entering the time zone requires you to enter the appropriate city from a list, rather than the actual time zone. It will also tell you what direction you are going using the solar azimuth. This only works if you can see the sun. BOO! A digital compass would do this much more effectively."
4,FTW100D7V --- A REALLY GRRRRREAT WATCH!,"My impressions after two days: if you are an engineer, you will love this watch. It arrived working with the solar battery half charged and the automatic update applied. I put it outside in the sun for an hour and charged up the battery. The first night it synced in with the timing signal and performed the update successfully. The next night the update failed. The auto light up at night is really neat ... just tilt your arm according to instructions and the light comes on for 1 second. There is actually more stuff (bearing mode, sunset/sunrise times) than you'll ever use. Biggest complaint ... there is sooooo much, that they had to make all the text words too small for easy reading. The number of options is staggering."
2,Reads like a text book,I was dissappointed with the book. There's no in depth discussion on any event. It just reads on and states facts like those in High School text books. Didn't capture me at all.
3,"If cricket's your game, this may be your book","Wondefully written, funny adventures of a cricket team traveling around the world and losing all but one of their games; HOWEVER, if you don't know much about or care about cricket, you have to skip a lot of pages, which is what I did. Still I enjoyed the book -- and it has a kicker of a conclusion -- but I can't recommend it without the cricket qualifation. P.S. I look forward to reading any other of his books."
1,Worst secondary source book on Heidegger I have ever encountered,"I am not going to write much because this book doesn't even warrant thorough critique. Basically, Heidegger is the most important philosopher of the 20th century. He dedicated his life to powerful, serious thinking. If that is something you might be interested in, do not read this book. How sad it is to know that the author ""teaches"" impressionable students ""philosophy."" He writes in a way that only seventeen year olds could find compelling... but I suppose this is intentional as they are the only people who could take such rubbish seriously. My advice: STAY AWAY"
2,Mere speculation !!,"This was a very disapointing experience. If Heidegger was to read this book or any Heidegger scholar the comment would simply be Heidegger's famous comment ""Das ist eine kindergarten"". And that is what it really is to its foundation mere kindergarden work."
1,Bitter Sweet.,Heidegger is one of the most notable philosophers of the 20th century. Harman's understanding to the philosophy of Heidegger is inadequate and misleading.
1,Rubbish,"Not worth the paper it is written on. I sense the author is just pushing his own view on heiddeger through this book: this is not a study of the crossroads between heiddeger and being, but the author's own view on heiddeger expressed in the terms of existential thinking."
5,A Picture of Freedom,"This book was very entertaining! It is about a young slave girl named Clotee who makes a new friend. Clotee is seceretly learnig to read and write against her masters will by paying attention to his son's school lessons. She makes her self a diary to write in and share her thoughts and feelings with. She must hide it though, or it could leak to the master. One day she learns a new word Freedom. She didn't know what it meant. Will she ever understand the true meaning of the word? Will she ever pursue freedom for herself? Read the book and find out!I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in books about slavery in America and to people who can really appreciate family bonds and good friends."
5,It deffinately Told of how slavery was in the South.,I thought the book was excellent> it protrayed a young girl growing up on a plantation in the South in the years before the civil war. It was very accurate and was true to the period. I'm 14 and most of these books are for younger children but I was just Drawn into these books and I have begun to collect them. I would deffinately recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction or just a good read.
5,Feel free to buy it,No complains. I don't have any reason for not to recommend this product. It works just fine you just have to try hard. Reasonable price. I am completely satisfaid.
2,meh...,"I've read this book cover to cover. I have two main complaints about this book:1) I was hoping to gain specific knowledge of hockey-specific training techniques. This book provides very little information about that. The workout and nutrition routines seem generic - like they could work for any sport. Furthermore, this book doesn't explain why you're doing what you're doing!2) The grammar and spelling is abosolutely atrocious. It was painfully to read some parts."
1,Fell Apart First Use,I unpacked the chopper and put in a green pepper. The blades fell out into the box. I threw it out!
5,One of the best purchases I've ever made!,"If you are looking at another brand of chopper (alligator)...STOP LOOKING! This amazing, top notch time saver is one of the best deals on the planet! I have 2 types of alligator choppers (standard and mini) and I think they are a complete waste of time. For less money you can get much more in terms of time saved AND frustration gone. I've chopped everything from onions, carrots, zuchini, bell peppers, broccoli in about a 1/3 of the time it would take me to do manually. The little cleaning tool that comes with it is a lifesaver as well. Can't say enough...as a matter of fact, hubby told me tonight to go ahead and order another just in case something were to happen to this one in the middle of cooking:-)"
4,Nice,"This makes chopping easy. Must cut smaller chunks though to fit the blade package. Hard to clean the white lid nubs that push the food through the blades. If you clean it right away it is easier, but still difficult, but worth the time."
3,Progressive GPC-4000 Fruit and Vegetable Chopper,"When I used it last night, I washed it in the dishwasher. The top piece had some water inside, when I sent to put it away. I can find no reason for this but water comes out when I shake it. Perhaps it is faulty, I don't know. I wish now I had purchased the cheaper one."
4,Third one,"I use this chopper nearly everyday. It cuts my prep time in half. My first and second chopper lasted over two years each. They were great. This third one, sticks when I lift the lid which is very annoying. I have to push down the grate after every chop.Heed the warnings of others, do not lose the little fork thingy that cleans it. I lost mine, and I spend more time cleaning it than chopping."
3,Don't cut Carrots!,I bent two of the blades cutting carrots which in turn dug into the top splitting the little squares. I emailed the manufacturer asking for a replacement blade and top and have heard nothing.
4,chopper,I love this chopper very helpful easy to wash and doesn't take up a lot of storage space. The blades are sharp which makes chopping vegetables an easy task. The only complain that the sizes are not varied enough.
1,Breaks Easily,"The chopper is a nice idea, and for soft, easily cut items, it works great. Unfortunately, the product is just not up to the task of chopping tougher items. Mine broke the second time I used it. Specifically, at the hinged area, a part of the top cracked off and so did a piece of the container bottom."
1,Weak material,"While the design of the dicer is excellent, the material of the container is far too weak; I had two containers crack over a two-year period. I hope they come up with a similar chopper with a stainless steel container"
4,Great Chopper,"I think the chopper is a great product. It's say to say when I received it, my container was cracked that holds the chopper. Trying to get a new container is like pulling teeth."
2,Don't waste your money...,"My husband saw this advertised in a cooking tools catalog and said he wanted it--he chops up potatoes for country fried hashbrowns on the weekend and thought this tool would save him time. So I bought it. I pulled it out and tested it when I make tacos the other night. The thing could hardly chop an onion! There is no way it was going to do potatoes! And it doesn't do cubes--it chops them in long rectangles...so you have to chop again anyways.The other complaint is that the hinge is 100% plastic, so it obviously would have broken quickly. I was hesitant to use it even on my onion! We will save this for using with just soft food like tomatoes and berries and such so extend it's life...and use my good old knife for everything else."
4,Great,"It's great product, the only thing that's difficult is when had to cut big chunks. Make sure you have a medium to small size befor you place it on the chopping block. Rest is easy... This just made my cooking so easy..."
1,not as good as it sounds,the progressive chopper is not as good as it sound it made chopping an onion a difficult task and i didnt even try it on a harder vegetable like a carrot. maybe its ok for hard boiled eggs to get perfect slices. Also its difficult to clean dont ever loose the comb for cleaning it comes with. thats really a necessity.
2,Breaks under pressure,I've bought TWO of these because I thought I'd been to rough on the first one. They both broke at the hinge on the plastic collection bin. Buy something sturdier.
3,It's ok,"It works OK. You have to press REALLY hard to chop onions. It chopped tomatoes pretty ok, though. Wanted it to make salsa and chop onions and other veggies for various recipes. I still use it and I make due with what it's capable of. It is just so annoying to have to use all my might to chop onions. Don't know if I got ridiculously dense onions or what, haha. I don't think I'd really recommend it, unless you're like me and hate chopping things manually. I still give in 3 stars, because it does get the job done and I use it."
4,It was good,Product looks good.Makes chopping much easier easy to wash and handle.Good outerbox to carry it from one place to another.Overall a good product
4,I use it all the time...they stand behind their product too!,"What a great piece of kitchen equipment. It works great and cleans up easy. The only downside is where the top connects to the clear box. Over some hard use mine cracked at the pivot point on one side and broke. I contacted Progressive and they sent a replacement immediately though. They could improve the durability, but it did not break from light use. Some onions going through the fine dice plate needed some ""extra pressure"" and I've used it many many times with no problems. I don't forsee this as a huge problem. You just have to know the limitations of the equipment and not try to force things through the machine is all. Progressive stood behind it and took care of it very quickly...no questions asked!"
2,Great while it worked,"I got this to cut up fruit for my toddler. It worked wonderfully and made all the prep much faster. Even though cleaning it out takes a while, it was worth it for the time savings and I ended up using it for a lot of other things besides toddler finger-foods, like fruit salad and mushrooms. Then it broke, with an entire corner of the collection box breaking off where the lid is mounted, after having it for less than one month. Happened while cutting up a mushroom. I'm returning it and looking for something sturdier."
2,Fruit & Vegetable Chopper,"This product did what it was advertised to do. I bought it because we are vegetarians and I chop a lot of veggies. It does chop them but it is very hard to press down. I got pretty tired pushing down on the top to chop them. It would be okay if you only need a small amount chopped, but I won't use it again to chop the amount I normally need to do."
5,"Time saver, awesome product!!","This is a great product that even my preschooler can use (with supervision, of course!). We make salad, pizza toppings, french fries.. if I only used this for chopping onions, it would be worth it! Just a tip: don't try to push the top piece-- it really needs to be smacked. But even with potatoes, my four year old can do it so don't believe some of the other reviews that say it takes a ton of force. You will need to cut an onion or potato in half though.. very large veggies don't chop well. But we can make an entire salad in less than two minutes. No more standing over a cutting board for a half hour! I use this every night!"
1,Broke after 3 months of light use,"After using this product about once every 2 weeks or so (and not heavily at all), the plastic piece on the side that holds the cover attached to the container. This happened while I lifted the cover up to place more onions on the grate. I will be contacting Amazon regarding warranty service as this product should last more than just 3 months.Overall, I did not find this chopper easy to use at all - it was difficult to press the cover down to get the vegetables through the chopping grates and still find a good knife much easier and simpler to use. I bought these due to the overwhelming percentage of positive reviews, but I should have paid more attention to those negative reviewers who have the same problem with this product like I did. Think twice before buying this item."
2,Mine Broke After a Few Uses,"There were a couple of things I really didn't like about this chopper. The main issue being that it wasn't very easy to chop with unless I sliced the vegetable in small pieces prior to chopping. Even the size of a quarter of an apple was tough. Then there was the problem with the middle piece (the actual chopping plane) coming up with the lid after chopping. My husband was using it one night and the plastic broke in the corner where the lid attaches to the bottom and rendered ours unusable. I love the design, I only wish it were much sturdier."
4,Good Tool,I do a fair amount of cooking that requires chopping vegies. I owned a similar product a few years ago it lasted a while until it broke from me having to slam the lid to chop vegies. This seems to be a stouter construction so it may last longer and I enjoy the versatility of the variety of blade options. I quater the onions and other vegies to fit and for easier chopping. The product saves me time chopping.
4,Finally Found a Chopper that will do what I want,"Great time saving device. Have to push firmly but it saves time. When reviewing comments pror to purchasing the chopper someone mentioned that the blades had rusted, so after cleaning I always lean it so that the blades will drain and dry quickly. The little cleaning comb provided with the chopper is a life saver -- Don't lose it!!! The only drawback I can see with this chopper is that there are no replacement blades that can be purchased individually."
5,PROGRESSIVE CHOPPER,Awesome product!!!! THIS PRODUCT HAS CUT MY CHOPPING TIME IN HALF!!!!!It eliminates the watery eyes when chopping onions...I also Love the durability of this product.
3,Progressive International GPC-4000 fruit and vegetable chopper,For the most part this item is good for cutting fruits and vegetables but the one blade is very weak and bends and becomes unuseable. the other 2 blades are great though.
2,Broke on second use,"We are happy with the results, but it takes a reasonable force to chop most items; and this is without overloading it.One pivot hook broke off on the second use so we can't recommend the unit."
3,Cooking Tools,"A nice addition -- useful for chopping veggies. Much as I enjoy using it each time I take it out, my first impulse is still a good sharp knife. If you are not good with the knife, this is the tool for you. If you are good with a knife for chopping and slicing and dicing, this will not be the first tool you think of with food preparation."
2,No Good For Seniors,my hands are not strong enough to use this product.also it's not somthing you just grab for doing those quick jobs. good quality just not for me.Progressive International Fruit and Vegetable Chopper (Purchased on 01/28/2010)
3,Fruit and Veggie Chopper,This product is good for potatoes and onions but I mostly bought it so it would julienne carrots and whatnot. As far as that goes it doesn't do a very good job.
3,Just OK,"Product is okay for the price. Blades aren't as sharp as I would like, but I like that it has 3 inserts to choose from. Won't be able to use this to help with my everyday cooking as I had hoped, but will be nice for when I am pressed for time."
2,Poor Quality / Broken Quickly,"I gave the product two stars because it really did work well for a short period of time. The concept is great, and I LOVED it, but it broke after about 4 uses. The main tray part broke as well as the slicer attachment, both just cracked under the pressure. Note: I was chopping onions. I guess it would potentially work well for soft things."
2,Chops very well but the top half retains water...,I love the way it chopped all kinds of fruits and vegetables but a significant drawback is water accumulates in the top half of the chopper. There is no way to drain it out. I ordered a replacement chopper and it had the same defect. When I returned the second one I was not credited the full amount I paid because Amazon deducted the value of free shipping etc to my refund. I did not want to try a third chopper because most likely would have the same defect - definitely unsanitary to have old water in the chopper!
5,This chopper is great,I've had the Ronco slice-o-matic and many other slicer/dicers but this one is made better and leaves no cuts or bitter aftertaste.
1,Hard to use/bulky,This is not strong enough to use as they promised. This is too bulky to get out . This is is awful to clean
2,no carrots,"One of the blades bent the 2nd week I had the device while I was slicing carrots. While the three blades and the catch cup are nice improvements to this brand, the blades are week and once bent.....you can no longer close it to chop. I think a version that presses on the veggies straight up and down may be better."
1,Broken already. Do not buy!,"This worked-until it broke on about the 3rd use. What a waste of money. Now I found an ""Alligator"" chopper- similar, but stronger!"
3,Chopper,I like it but have to be careful not to put anything in unless cut thin enough to not put too much of a bind on the top part that is pushing down on the vegies. The plastic cracked. My fault trying to hurry.
2,I'm not superwoman,You have to be strong to use this chopper. I can't chop anything because I am not strong enough to push that sucker down. Cleaning also sucks. Would not recommend.
3,Blades dulled within a couple weeks,"My father has a Vidalia Chop Wizard; I presumed this would be of comparable quality, but I was sorely disappointed. We dehydrate a lot of food at my house. The slicing blade is good for bananas or kiwis and not much else (though admittedly it does say that on the slicing plate). The dicing/chopping blades became dull within a couple weeks of heavy use, leaving even my onions a mushy mess. My dad's chop wizard is still going strong after 3 or 4 years though.On the up-side, I appreciate the inclusion of a storage box with this product."
3,Does what it claims to do,"Ok.. so here is a hard plastic chopper. It does what it claims.. but like the smaller choppers of this type, it breaks to easy.I can't recommend this for anyone, the hinges broke on the third use and one of the chopping grides broke as well."
4,no more tears,"I got this for my wife who chops onions like every other day- it takes a little force, but it chops so quick and even. I love it, and its easy to clean."
4,Great product,The only negative is how hard you have to push down to get it to cut. The blades could be sharper but this product is great. So much easier then cutting by hand.
5,"Works great, if you know a few tricks","To respond to a few other reviews, first, I don't try to push on top to chop, I make a fist and pop it down (on the side of my fist, not a punch like you are punching someone in the face). It has worked every time.Second, as for cleaning the white top, if you keep it submerged in water and use the cleaning tool, the top cleans easily (I pull the tool in a couple of different directions to get everything out. Keeping the top submerged while cleaning is the trick. I also have the onion chopper for a smaller dice, and it works just as well. Hope this helps."
2,Not what I had hoped,"Unfortunately this chopper didn't work as I had hoped. It was quite difficult to push anything through, even my strong boyfriend couldn't do it without putting his whole weight on it. It smashed my tomatoes to mush and everything got all stuck. It does come with a tool to help clean it. The tool works well to clean, but overall it didn't work all that well AND it was terribly annoying to clean. I returned it."
4,chopper,This is a handy little chopper and slicer that can handle the big jobs. The thing I use it most for is chopping onions. We buy a 50 lb bag and chop the whole bag and freeze it.
2,Broke in 2 months,"Chopper was working great, but the other day the plastic container shattered while using it. Definitely a waste of money."
2,Chopper Base Broken,"I bought this product last year. I hardly used 2-3 times. Base got broken. Not i am able to use it. I don't know whether they will replace base unit. Please let me know, if someone know how can i get new base."
2,Good Until it Broke,This onion & Veggie chopper worked great until the plastic hinge broke trying to dice a thin piece of onion. It broke on maybe it's 10th use. I'm kind of surprised that the back hinge wasn't reinforced at all. It's no good if it's broken. I got a pair of RSVP Onion Goggles to use when cutting onions and they work great!
3,Its okay,I use these at my restaurant all the time. On this particular one you cannot chop anything to heavy as it bends the blades.
3,Works well,Works great for most veggies but not for celery or carrots. It gets stuck and its pretty hard to get them out.
2,Progressive Food Chopper,"Chopper worked OK til my wife put something in it that was hard to cut, pressed down too hard, and snapped off oneof the swivel ears on the side that let the top swing up and down, rendering it useless.Granted, she shouldn't have pushed so hard but, in my opinion, its incumbent upon the manufacturer to foresee that thisis a possibility and take steps to overcome it. Plastic ears and matching ring on the top do not cut it (no pun intended).The food also sticks in the little squares sometimes and has to be pushed out of each one."
4,Amazing Purchase,I Bought these as gifts for my sister and aunt. They love it.Cooking has become so much easier for them.I'm so happy that the gifts i got them are useful.Amazon delivered them in time.
5,Great food chopper,This is an awesome product!! Preparation time is cut in half with this unit. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend hours in the kitchen hand chopping veggies!!
1,chopper quickly broke,"The first time I used the chopper I was making tuna fish salad. So as per instructions on page 4 I selected the small dice blade for celery. After cutting off a 3 inch piece of celery, I inserted it in the chopper, pushed down on the lever, and the top lever broke at its pivot point. Wallah! chopped plastic."
5,Great Product! Love the changeable grids!,"This chopper is fantastic! Bought as a gift for my fiancee. He had previously had an older model, but broke it a while back. This model seems to be sturdier and more heavy duty. The container that holds the chopped items is larger than his old one was also. The different sized grids are a really nice feature! The cleaning tool makes clean up a breeze. (I've tried it without the tool - takes forever, and you still have a really tough time getting all the little pieces out!) Love this product!"
1,"The plastic is highly breakable, vegetables escape the blade","I bought this dicer with the expectation to make daily use during dinner time, while cooking for two. It was clear since the beginning that the 45 degree angle for applying pressure was not ideal (as opposed to 180 degrees), which end up requiring a bit more of pressure, and get vegetables to escape here and there from the chopping block. But this is not all the problem. Here's what happened: to our dismay, while I was cutting our carrots the other night, the colored part of the dicer broke, rendering the whole thing unusable, after only a couple of weeks of use (maybe 5 times?). Thus, unfortunately, it is not a high quality piece: both design and material are wanting. We are shopping only for metal gadgets of the sort."
4,Great product,Very pleased with it after I got used to it. Just need to make sure the top is completely down on the hinges before you slam it.
5,very good,does what it says it will.. nice to have a non electric chopper. Also nice to have it all contained instead of all over the counter.
2,Not as versatile as you think,"I had cubing vegetables. It is a chore during cooking that I have never fancied. I thought with this I could save a lot of time. Unfortunately, that just wasn't the case. The product couldn't go through a 3/4"" slice of sweet potato and the outer layer of a peeled onion (i.e. not the husky layer) gets stuck in the grate. It was not a simple matter to get all of the vegetables fully through the grate is what I am driving at. There was always a litle work afterward."
5,"Works great, does not break.","I bought this chopper over two years ago and very happy with it. Works great even on harder-to-chop stuff, including potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, etc. Before this chopper, I had a couple of others that would break after I use them for a couple of times - not this one!"
3,Need to be more sharp,"I am not saying it is the worst kitchen helping item... However, It need more power than the youtube video shows. I have to place it on ground to cut onion.I think the problem is with the blades. Need to be sharpened."
5,LOVE MY CHOPPER!!!!!,"I have had a few of the progressive ones the only thing is the hinges break :( I saw this one and thought ahh that might work better seems a little more heavy duty. I LOVE IT!!! Specially for doing potatoes! I can get soo much prerpared in soo little time and really the clean up is not that bad. The one down fall I dont like is the smaller chopper I wish there was a way they had the smaller holes like the progressive for like onions and green peppers I will still use my progressive for that but all the other stuff THIS is the chopper to buy. Even my 12 year old daughter loves it and said ""mom when I move out you WILL buy me a few of these right?"" awww very handy specially when time is limited and you don't trust people with knives! Highly recommend!"
1,'Progressive International GPC-4000 Vegetable Chopper',"Very tidy little product and the containers are a good size. I found that it dices most vegetables as long as they are soft - it jams on harder ones such as carrots, turnips and so on. Also it is not suitable for anyone who has a shoulder injury or arthritis because you have to hit it very hard to make it do its job. There are better products on the market than this. Will be giving it away to someone young and strong."
5,Wonderful!,"Great product! I bought this one for my mom as a gift because I have experience with this one. First of all, the product awesome, it's very useful when you have limited time, it's super easy to use, and easy to clean and store food inside containers. Im very pleased with this purchase and will definitely recommend this one for other people who want save their time in kitchen."
4,Gets the job done,This product works great. The only con I would have is with some veggies it is difficult to push all the way through but for most softer iitems it works great. Makes quick work of chopping large amounts of food. I don't use it for small ammounts as the cleanup seems too much of a bother but for big jobs it's great.
2,not great,good for only few vegetablestomatoes get smashedfor onions you need to put lotss of pressure. I have to put my whole weight on top of it to cut the onions
5,Great Time Saver,I love this chopper - easy to make salsa and any vegetable soups! Also great for home made fries.
3,knob broken after 2 weeks,"This tripod was recommended, so I bought one. Unfortunately I found out one knob that secures the extension was broken after 2 weeks use. Maybe because it is plastic, it is not strong? I was surprised because it is not a very cheap one. I am thinking to buy it again after I return to amazon or if I can find a better replacement."
5,Great compact tripod even for SLR,This supports my Canon 450D with a 18-200mm lens with no problem. The ball head can be tightened to stop it shifting with gravity. The best thing is that it weighs so little and I can zip it up inside my backpack with ease.
3,If you want to read a good book about --,"--the supposed relationship of Mary of Nazareth and Agrippa, son of Herod the Great, dig up a novel written in the early 1950's, I think, by Robert Graves. It's called KING JESUS. Whether the theory is true or not, Graves will give you a much more educated version of it than this writer. In fact, when in need of a great novel to read, look up most of what's left of Robert's Graves novels. He is too soon forgotten, while people read second and third hand dreck like this -- although for those who haven't heard of Graves, this is simpler and entertaining."
5,A fast-moving funny satire,"A funny but ultimately depressing read, Perotta asks what happens when you realize your dreams, and then realize they're not all that great. The book looks at a high school election and the adults and teens participating in it. In spite of all the effort put into the election, it seems a futile exercise: most of the kids don't care, and the ones that do care too much. By the end, everyone walks away unsatisfied - if not diminished - by their electoral experience. And yet, even if Perotta's characters can't give meaning to their lives, at least he gives the whole thing humor and humanity."
4,Great book!,"I watched the movie first a long time ago and recently I decided to read the book. I loved the book. It was a quick fun read. I thought the book clarified a lot of what was in the movie since it was written with all the different perspectives (Paul, Tammy, Lisz, Tracy, Mr. M, etc). The plot and characters were interesting. If you're looking for a good, short read, pick this book up."
2,A mildly interesting book made mostly of fluff,"I have to say that dissapointed with Election. I am a Junior in high school now and the characters just didn't ring true with me. The plot was mildly interesting with a few plot twists here and there, but overall it seemed like just a glorified teenage soap opera to me. The one excelent aspect of the book was the several different points of view by each character, which was superbly done. Overall, however, I expected more from a Harvard grad!"
1,See the movie instead!,"I saw the movie first and was extremely disappointed with the book. Perrotta's writing is average, at best. He seems to take the easy way out and changes the point of view every few paragraphs. If this is supposed to be some innovative writing style, then it failed miserably in my opinion. The characters don't come to life at all in the book. If you liked the movie, you will probably not like the book. If you have not seen the movie, you will probably not like the book!"
2,Not his best work.,"I am only eleven years old and I can tell you right now that Election was not a good book. It is realistic about how some people live, especially in New Jersey. But, it does not focus on Tracy Flick. She's the best character, why didn't Perrata develop her more. Instead, he foucused on Tammy and Paul Warren, and Mr.M. Terrible writing. You think a guy from Yale would do better than that. The movie was better."
3,quick & cute,"Tracy Flick wants to win her highschool presidential election, & she'll be beyond bothered if anyone else tries to get in her way. This amusing little book (large print, 200 pages) is told through the various perspectives of those caught up in the election & gives a humorous look at the lives of those affected.I hate to say I liked the movie better than the book- but, I did.While the book is charming & funny- the character's actually have less depth than they do in the movie- & the laugh's are much fewer. The book also lacks emotional resonance, whereas the movie actually gets you more riled up about the election & what happens to those involved.It's a quick, easy read & it does provide some amusement- but I'm going to have to say, (and it pains me to do so) that you're better off watching the movie."
4,Unflinching and hysterical,"I am a new fan of Tom Perrotta, but one who is gaining loyalty. 'Little Children' left me wanting more and 'Election' delivered. It is a riotous look at a high school election gone horribly wrong and the lives that become tangled up in it. The cast of characters are at once utterly real and complete caricatures. Their actions are believable, their thought processes complete and yet they are exaggerations of the people we know in daily life (not to mention a whole lot funnier). 'Election' is a breeze at 200 pages but a very worthwhile read. It would be the perfect book to bring on a plane, for a day trip to the beach, or a nice rainy day entertainment. If you haven't read anything by Perrotta yet this is a good place to start, and if you have it'll make the hunger for his next book more intense."
3,Election,"I saw the movie made from this book first and loved it, but usually the book is so much more than the movie, so I decided to read the book too. The first thing that struck me was how closely the movie followed the book, not only in plot, but in style and point of view. I enjoyed the book, but I wonder if I would have had a different take on it had I not seen the movie first. I almost never say this about a movie versus a book, but if you could choose only one, I think I might choose the movie. Not because the book isn't good, it is, but because I think that the movie was one of those rare things that really captured its original source and added extra spark."
5,great,A funny book with an unexpected ending. It would be interesting if something like this happened at my dull ghetto high school.
3,"INTERESTING, BUT RENT THE MOVIE","Having seen and throughly enjoyed the movie version of this, I found the book to be about the same story, only told with more emphasis on the characters. Paul, Tammy, Tracy and Lisa are given a greater emotional range than they are allowed in the film, which is interesting, but dillutes the satirical impact of the material. In some cases, the characters' fates are even worse than the film, although the ending is more hopeful.The film, however, is one of my favorites for this year, and you should by all means go and see it (having died a quick death in theaters, it deserves a new life on video and DVD). A good read, though, and I think I might check out some of the author's other work. This is one of those rare cases, however, where the movie is better than the book."
4,Light and Fun,"I enjoyed this short book by a perceptive author. Perotta chronicles the adolescent years of high school with insight and sincerity. The novel describes a funny series of events surrounding a high school election, and these almost-adult teens learn some final lessons about real life and what motivates us.I disliked Perotta's comparison of Bill Clinton's perjury to Clarence Thomas' defence against Anita Hill. Thomas was exonerated and found to have been truthful, while snake-in-the-grass was found guilty and loved all the more for it. Why Perotta makes his thoughtful character Lisa interested in campaigning for Clinton is beyond any thinking adult."
4,I swear there was a book here a moment ago.,"I read this book in one sitting in a local bookstore. Because it was so short, I never became attached to any of the characters, and the story did not develop any real weight. Still, it isn't fair to criticise a book for brevity alone, and I thought that the characters interesting--Perrotta seems to have a talent for telling you a lot about someone through implication. He also evoked the early 1990s remarkably well, or at least I assume he did. (I wasn't paying much attention at that time.) The high school in the book is an excellent microcosm for human pride, folly and stupidity, as students and teachers take absurd risks to secure a completely useless and ceremonial position. This isn't a classic book, but it is a better way that most of spending an hour and a half."
3,"Makes some good points and some biting comments, but overall lacking in depth.","As with one or two other disappointed reviewers, I was annoyed and disappointed in the lack of character depth. The book makes some really interesting points, but being so short and relying so much on a reader simply buying in to what he's told, not what's shown (as another reviewer points out, there's no realy evidence why Tracy would be an obvious choice for President, or what makes Mr M. a popular teacher) the whole thing ended up feeling extremely superficial. For a very short book, it was quite a slog; I didn't really empathise with any of the characters; overall, I just felt like it was a let down when it could (should?) have been a fascinating book. It was OK, but just OK. I couldn't see myself re-reading it or recommending it to others, and based on this andThe Abstinence Teacher (Reading Group Gold), I won't be jumping at the chance to read any more Perrotta."
4,don't tell me you couldn't identify with the characters,"Tome Perotta's engaging novel is as dark as it is comic as it is truthful. His characters may be slightly over the top, but they certainly echo the social/personality slot we are all given and confined to during high school. Perotta actually destructed some stereotypes, especially with the teacher everyone loves, Mr. M. My only criticism is in the character of Paul, who I found flat and uninteresting. Read this book if you were even semi-conscious at any point during high school and I'm sure you will feel like you knew some of the characters."
3,"Completely Unspectacular, But Fun","""Election"" was enjoyable; I'm not surprised it will soon be yet another watchable, cute teen movie. The characters were all similar in that they didn't have much depth, (except for Tammy, the most interesting). However, the writing wasn't especially interesting- anyone who could read the book could probably also write it. Oh, and b/c you'll probably finish it in a couple hours, you might not want to spend 10 dollars on it...try the library-just a tip!"
5,great scent,this might be an old perfume but you should try it..it smells so good and it lasts forever..hard to find in stores but this product was great and I will buy again from here
4,Nice deal,"This bag was posted on SlickDeals website for eleven dollars and ninty-nine cents. For that price i am very happy with my purchase.The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is becasue there are no zippered pockets only velcro. I like zippered pockets to keep the dust out as much as possible.There is also not enough padding to hold a laptop securly, but then again I didn't purchase it for that reason."
3,An entertaining medical mystery.,"This book eventually becomes a page-turner as the reader proceeds to see whether the conclusion has been guessed correctly. Sometimes the dialogue crowds out the descriptive element, leaving the mystery thin. This prevented me from being captured by the plot on my first attempt at reading the book. However, my wife and I ended up wrestling the book back and forth to see who could finish first. Being a native of northeastern Ohio and a Tribe fan, I enjoyed the liberal Cleveland references, which could be lost on a non-Buckeye. The medical references were accurate, not surprising for a physician-author. Although I wasn't the first to pick the ""murder weapon"", after my wife pointed it out to me it almost seemed too obvious, and the chase was to see ""who dun it"". I'm planning on reading more by Pomidor, especially to see if the flow of dialogue and narration feel more natural the next time around."
1,"Good service, JUNK STRINGS.....DONT BUY","The service was great and all...no complaints w the seller. However, the strings are extremely cheap and sound like hell. Been playing for many years, and this is by far the worst set of strings i've ever played. I honestly didnt think strings of such poor quality existed. Dont waste your time or money."
4,"Something to brighten my deep, dark guitar.","I have a Breedlove which sounds terrific, but always wanted a little more top, and a little brighter sound. Tried several kinds of strings before seeing a review of these in which some people were complaining that the strings were ""too bright"" on their Taylor, I think.... I figured it was perfect for my guitar, which was never quite bright enough.So far I'm pretty happy with the sound! Cheaper than coated strings, and with the help of some ""String-ease"" these have lasted me a while and still sound great."
3,"Sound terribly tinny at first, warm up after a while.","I normally use La Bellas Silk and Steel strings, but I thought I'd switch to Earthwoods this time just to try them out. They're alright. The first week or so, I thought they sounded awful. They were tinny and metallic sounding. Not at all appropriate to the name. However, they've warmed up considerably since then. They still don't sound as great as I'd like, but they'll do until I buy a new set. I probably wouldn't buy these again."
4,WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!,I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS RUNNING THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM WITH ADD ON AMPS AND SUBS BUT WITH THIS ADAPTER AND RUNNING THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM ON THE LOW SIDE OUTPUTS IN MY AFTERMARKET RADIO AND MY SUBS ON THE HIGH OUTPUT SIDE I NOW HAVE AN AWESOME SOUNDING SYSTEM FULL OF BASS!!!!! GREAT PURCHASE
3,No more fear of flying,"This book ended any nervousness I had about flying (which was admittedly never a full-blown fear...just an uneasiness), I guess by humanizing the pilots and what they can overcome. A decent story, even if you're waiting the whole time for character interaction. Definitely a set-up book, but a worthy read, nonetheless.I deleted my original review so I could change the stars to 3 as I'd originally intended."
1,Very Disappointing,"The author is very knowledgable about the art of flying, and the technical aspects of the flight were good, but the dialogue just did not with the situations in my opinion, there was no romance, and Catherine Phillips the captain, and Becky her ""intended"" were just not endearing characters."
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed with the Dlo remote control for my ipod. What's the point of a remote when it has to be an inch away with a direct line to the senor? I brought it back to the store and decided to give it another try with a different brand. I got the Griffin AirClick which was a couple of dollars cheaper and you can point it wherever you want and the ipod responds.
1,Terrible,"The writing was incredibly poor. The story sort of limps along and trails away without resolution. It was almost as if Mr. Ferring didn't care how it ended and lost interest in even writing it.A note to would be authors - if you feel the need to explain what your character is feeling then you have utterly failed. The characters should drive the plot, not the reverse."
1,Three for the price of none,"While browsing for a book to read on my off time at work I mistakenly purchased this book thinking that I was getting a deal in that there were three books already combined into one.I play Games Workshop minature games and enjoy the rich world that these stories come from but Konrad is a collection to be avoided.The storyline seems to skip with giant leaps of coincidence that the author offhandedly tries to patch into a weak ""guided by sigmar"" web of events excuse, Konrad just chops and chops everything in sight and has no control over his life.The whole book is just annoyingly lacking of substance or description of characters or events.grab your sword and just hack away and oh wow we saved to world on accident.I have seen better stories from High school students"
3,Some soil should not be disturbed.,"Island of the Dead uses a creepy what if scenario on an actual piece of NYC property for low grade chills. Hart Island is the burial ground for the unidentified dead found in New York City. Developer Rupert King (Malcolm McDowell) wants to develop the island into Hope City, a low incoming housing community. But his ulterior motives may be far from humanitarian, and the dead know no secrets. King and several other characters (an orphaned cop identifying some remains, prisoners burying the recent dead, and some others) become trapped on the island as the increasingly restless spirits of the dead go on the attack via flies and maggots. Island of the Dead tries to emphasize atmosphere and mystery, but its pace is far too slow and the film feels padded. Still it's unique enough to watch once if you like supernatural tales and a tape is easily accessible, but it's not worth digging up."
2,"Barely watchable ""horror"" flick...","Malcolm McDowell isn't respected enough. He's a fabulous actor oozing with talent and yet he gets parts like the character of Rubert King in ""Island of the Dead."" King is a rich snob who buys a New York island and has plans to turn it into a city. But he didn't plan on the killer flies that make you start to decompose after one bite! A movie with the title ""Island of the Dead"" practically promises zombies, but this is no such case. Instead we get killer flies that are neither scary nor inspired. The idea of it all flops on the screen and no suspense is built. The characters are also very bland and entirely expendable. As for Malcolm McDowell, he's done better."
2,Twist locks break in cold weather,The Digi 718SHB is certainly a nice tripod. It's small and you can take it anywhere. The thing that makes me very unhappy about it is the quality of the twist locks. The plastic they are made of becomes brittle under freezing temperatures. During a trip to the Grand Canyon 3 locks broke because of the relatively cold weather (-5C/23F). I had to mend them with scotch tape. It's very upsetting as I thought a Manfrotto tripod would last me forever.
4,718SHB tripod,Nice little travel tripod. I used it with a smallish DSLR setup and it was close to it's limit even there.
5,life saver,i get frequent ingrown toenails & this item has been a blessing. cuts an even line & able to slide into small areas that other clippers cannot reach.
2,Think twice,Quite uncomfortable -- runs too small and O-ring scratches top of foot. Waited too long and couldn't return item. Waste of money.
5,funniest Coles book,"A small, bankrupt principality fakes a Communist insurrection to gain foreign aid. Much funnier than Mouse That Roared & similar things, since it was written by Manning Coles."
3,Blitz 22400 Swivel/On Off Spout,item was not for me...i was wanting it to fit my 5 and 2+ gallon blitz gas containers which it did not...i'm not sure what blitz products it would fit...way too small for any blitz products i own...probably would help if seller listed the items it fits...seller was great in a refund after i returned it...
1,DOES NOT fit standard can,"I am not sure what can this nozzle is supposed to fit, but not a standard five gallon gas can. Great design.. IF it fit my cans."
5,Paul Capp,"I too am frustrated about the inability to get this product. I suspect that Via Nueva is no longer in business. At any rate, I still have a small amount left over and I am considering taking it to a spice shop to see what it contains. I concur that this is THE BEST Carne Asada Mix ever!!!"
1,received wrong item,I ordered a LA Lakers tie as that is what I searched for on Amazon and that is the picture that the company had up for purchase. I received the Phoenix Suns. They returned no problem. They informed me that they had no Lakers ties in stock and I never received an e-mail or other notification when the tie came back into stock.
4,chainsaw sally kick a**,bought this Dvd from amy Lynn best website a few years ago it's kinda cool you have amy and some of the women from her movies also melantha blackthorne and you have the great April burial aka chainsaw sally****spoiler alert****sally beats everyones a**
1,"Bad concept, bad execution, bad DVD","The ""Average Women of Horror"" and ""the most chubby actresses in underground horror"" is how the Editorial Review should read. These women are so minimally attractive that you're relieved to see them shower with all their clothes on. The event is a kiddie pool in the middle of a hotel banquet hall filled with a pink paste that is supposed to be blood. For a horrifying atmosphere they have all the lights on while some acid casualty riffs hack chops on a casio keyboard full blast. A horror movie about women wrestlers(or gory wrestling matches) would of been pretty cool. Instead this a bunch of non athletes in dumpster diver outfits rolling around as if in slow motion."
2,Poor Quality Control,"Pretty , but the quality control is terrible. Be prepared for faulty pieces and missing screws and other parts. So you may not be able to put it together without calling the company for replacement parts. Directions for assembling the piece remain faulty-- as described by other writers. Nothing has been corrected. If the tv is on the way, it's best to order the stand so you have a week or two to get the missing parts from the company. It's also not the most stable stand either. Buy with care."
1,Avoid This One Like the Plague,I wasted my money getting this stand for my HL61A750. The glass shelves aren't designed for modern components and it is REALLY tough to get at the components from the rear.
4,GReat sturdy TV Stand,Neat design. You can vary the width of the unit and the glass ledges are designed in such a way that they look fine with any width. It is a bit complicated to put together but is worth the effort - just follow the directions
4,Not deep enough for standard equipment 3.5 Stars,"my samsung dvd/receiver pertrudes about two inches out of the front of the stand because it isn't deep enough. DirectTV DVR fits fine.Very nice looking, sturdy enough."
2,Deceptive Picture,"Let me start off by saying this is a nicely constructed stand, however when you use the expanded section for a 61"" TV, the glass shelves do not reach both ends of the stand, you loose approx 9"" of usable shelf area and it looks funny. The picture provided is very deceptive. I guess I'll have to get new glass cut so I can use the full width of the stand."
2,"Not good for 61"" TV","While this stand is supposed to be the recommended stand for the current line of Samsung DLP TVs from 50"" to 61"", it's very flimsy when used with the 61"" model. When adjusted to this maximum length, the horizontal cross-bar bends slightly downwards under the weight of the TV set."
4,Adjustable Tv Stand,"Overall a pretty nice stand. Only problem is there is not much support for surround sound tuner, cable box etc. The middle sags a little bit but it looks great!"
3,"Stand OK, but not great","Like all big screen stands I failed to see the 'value' - this is $30 of powder coated steel, powder coated MDF and a couple of glass shelves. Why we are all expected to pay $300 for such things defeats me - oh, yes 'cos the TV already cost a boat load of money!The stand is fine - it does the job. For the 61"" Samsung, I would say it is actually too small - the TV does not feel secure on it, feel like the stand needs more depth for the resultant 'structure' to feel secure. So I'll anchor the TV to the wall at the top, to avoid tipping - if my kids were younger this would be an absolute must-do modification to the setup.I bought this for 61A750 (as suggested by Amazon) - Pinnacle make stand which is designed for Samsung 61-67"" TV's - which I am sure is the one Samsung intend to be used with the 61A750. Caveat emptor."
3,"Samsung TR-500X3BX Adjustable 50-, 56- and 61-Inch DLP TV Stand","Samsung TR-500X3BX Adjustable 50-, 56- and 61-Inch DLP TV StandProduct required assembly, some of the connecting parts leave abit to be desired. However now that I have it in the locationdesired, it is doing a fine job supporting the 61in Tv andassociated equipment. Product arrived 3 days earlier thanestimated."
4,Samsung TR-500x3b,"Nice unit fairly easy to assemble, just make sure you have some room to assemble it and perhaps on a carpeted area. I purchased the 61"" DLP and this stand becomes quite wide for this TV. It almost seems to sag across the middle, but not bad. Nice finish, really goes well with the Samsung DLP's.Mine was ordered just a week before X-mas 07 and arrived 3 days after ordering, in good condition. Free shipping and $199.00, cant beat that."
4,Samsung TR-500X3B TV stand,I had some difficulty getting some of the parts to mate correctly with another part as per instructions. Dowel pins are used to join one piece to another at several locations during the assembly. Some parts joined in this manner did not seem to be secure enough so I used additional wood screws to reinforce the assembly. A couple of minor parts were broken during the assembly. I called and described the parts broken and these were replaced without charge within about seven working days.
4,"Matches perfectly with my 56"" Samsung DLP","This stand matches perfectly with my 56"" Samsung DLP (HLT5687S) and it looks very good. The TV and stand were made for each other. The shelves provide enough room for my space hogging HD+DVR cable box and four video game systems.My only complaints are the instructions that came with the stand are incorrect. Go to Pinnacle Design's web site and download a PDF of the correct version. Also, my stand had one missing bolt, so I called the 800 number at 1:00 AM ET on a Friday night/Saturday morning and to my surprise, someone answered and FedExed replacement bolts to me right away. This was great, however they got the address on the shipping label wrong (instead of street number 18, they accidentally typed 81) and the only reason I got the package is because the FedEx guy recognized my name and delivered it to me anyway.Other than that though, I have no complaints with this stand and it looks great."
2,Good looking but poorly designed stand,"I have two earlier models of Samsung stands for 61 inch DLP-HDTVs that are sturdier and better designed/made. This one's metal bars that support the shelves are not sufficiently sturdy nor well anchored. I had to put a piece of wood in the middle, under the lower glass shelf, to prevent it from breaking/buckling under the weight of my A/V receiver and the center speaker. Clearly the designer and the builder of this stand did not consider that the user may want to buy it for his/her A/V receiver, center speaker, DVD player, cable box, and others (a lap top in my case, to listen to music through i-tunes and other sites). I'm going to live with it but those who are considering buying this stand are well-advised to check the size and weight of the components it is to accommodate."
2,Not for a 61 inch television,Nice stand but poorly made for a 61 inch television. It works for up to 50inches but then is very unstable for anything over. It was a waste of 250 dollars because I need a new one.
3,2 hours to assemble by 2 guys,I wish I had read the first review before assembling it. The wrong instruction frustrated us. There are multiple scratches on a few wooden pieces. We wonder if it was a return. It is somehow well wrapped and packed like brand new. Looks good though. May consider reassemble it when I got time.
2,Samsung DLP stand for 61',"Someone else stated this perfectly....While this stand is supposed to be the recommended stand for the current line of Samsung DLP TVs from 50"" to 61"", it's very flimsy when used with the 61"" model. When adjusted to this maximum length, the horizontal cross-bar bends slightly downwards under the weight of the TV set.Mine is doing this also. Please avoid like the plague if you are getting the 61'"
2,Stand is OK but has limitations,"I purchased this stand with my Samsung 61"" DLP TV.First, I would like to say that this would be a beautiful stand for a 50"" television, but for a 61"" TV, the glass shelves are just too short to make the stand look nice. I would rather they ask you the size and ship appropriate shelves with it separately. Luckily my Uncle owns a glass shop and I can get the shelf replaced.Second, Watch the size of your components. I have an Onkyo TX-NR801 receiver and the stand is not deep enough for my receiver. It sticks out 3"" from the front of the stand. What I am going to do is replace the bottom piece of glass with a piece of finished wood (painted with gloss black paint) that is 4 inches deeper. The wood will stick out from the front of the stand but will give the receiver better support and even it out a bit."
3,Typical Chinese quality,"The stand itself doesn't look bad except that the glass is cut for the smallest configuration. When you set it up for the 61"" tv, it looks ok but not great. The worst thing I found was the quality of the hardware...typical low stress metal. The cam lock heads will strip very easily and I found a small flathead screwdriver is the way to go there. I'm waiting still for the tv so I can't comment on the strength but from looking at other reviews, I'm not expecting it to be solid and free from flex. Come on America...let's start manufacturing back here like the good old days when WE were the major exporters and not importers of low grade stuff."
1,This is horrible-don't buy it!,I got this thing and it was so shabby one of the legs would not stay on it and if it would have I still would have sent it back.It is not very stable and I would not trust it to put and expensive TV on. This thing looks fantastic but it is not up to par in my book.
4,"A good substitute, Chebe is better though","This is very easy to mix up, and the taste is plain pizza dough. Have some gluten-free flour of some sort on hand (or use some extra of this mix), this is a very sticky dough starting out. I'd recommend a liberal brushing with some garlic olive oil before adding toppings (just mince some garlic and mix it into a cup of olive oil), otherwise the crust can get pretty hard on the edges.For someone who loves pizza, but can't have wheat or gluten, this is the best thing out there.EDIT: We've since discovered the Chebe products, which are much more like bread. The pizza crust is excellent, not sticky like Orgran and available on Amazon."
4,One Really Great Dance Song,"Back in it's hay-day, this was one of the most requested dance songs at the clubs. (Mid-1990s) Antoinette Robinson provides really great vocals for a simple, yet engadging beat-filled song. I also recommend this CD single because you can listen to various versions of the song and determine which mix is right for you. Personally I liked the Radio Mix as it wasn't overly filled with the typical heirs of the Club Mix and ended with a short and sweet memory instead of the 'isn't this song over yet?' feel you can get on overly done mixes. But if you just want to stop the music and listen to some really beautiful vocal stylings, I highly recommend the Accapella track."
3,A good guide of color combinations,"Very good, if not thorough, color reference, with very good color combinations (color charts are included as well). Perhaps a bigger variety of ""moods"" or ""styles"" (as the combinations are classified) could have made this book more of a definitive reference.The prose that accompanies each chapter and tries to bring some rationality to the choices of colors and explain the creation of new combinations is somewhat shallow, and I found it quite confusing for the use of terms left unexplained, and a somewhat clunky translation from the Japanese."
4,Strange religion that millions embrace,"Well written by one who moved into the circles of this strange religion Dr. Carol Dow (the author) is said to have attended many ceremonies and talked with many concerning the faith that 160 million + embrace while living and studing in Brazil. Her book explains many of the rituals and beliefs of the religion, makes references to likenesses of Roman Catholic saints to persons in the faith. photos and illustrations are given to bring the reader into a better understanding visually . Methods of healing, appeasement of the entities,the persona of the entities and many other aspects are well covered . This is a great book for one practicing SARAV'A or for one studing various religions of the world. Obviously it is one that cannot be ignored with such a large following worldwide. A great reference book for ones shelf."
4,shiny for a minute,Was as seller described but after I washed it it went dull. So whatever you do dont touch it with cleaning products or brush or clothes. It now has little scratches in it and is dull.
1,Product does not match picture,"I ordered this product thinking it's the assembly as pictured, but it turned out to be the pulley only. Giving 1 star because the picture is misleading."
2,"Loud, uncomfortable. But nice programmable keys.","Let me start of by saying I have had this keyboard for 6 years. However, out of that 6 years, I have really only mainly used it for about 2 years.I really don't like this keyboard at all. First of all, it's loud as heck. You don't even have to type any letters, as long as your fingers are just barely on the keys they make a ton of noise.It's not that comfortable either, I mean, when you type you have to press harder on the keys than what I'm used to.The programmable keys, however, are nice. But I never really used them as much as I thought I would.Anyway, just get Razer Black Widow instead of this old thing."
3,"Worked OK initially, but broke down over time","I've had this keyboard for almost 2 years now and the keyboard bounce and a few keys that only actuate about half the time is driving me to toss it and buy another keyboard. The keyboard bounce started after about 9 months (keys typing twice for a single press). I keep the keyboard quite clean (I never eat around the keyboard) and I do use the keyboard for up to 10 hours each day, but for this price you would expect it to last longer than this. I won't buy another Razer brand keyboard, I can tell you that.Windows 7 64-bit, USB, KVM"
3,decent...,"nice keyboard, keys feel and react good, great response time..only the macro keys light up blue, and the media buttons aren't really positioned wellthere are better keyboards out there"
1,JUNK,This thing came with my HP Blackbird Game PC.In the 1 year warranty I had to replace it twice and now just 1 month after the warranty expired it is out again.Sometimes when the PC starts it is dead.Sometimes all the lit keys flash like crazy and all 3 of the squares in the top right corner stay lit.When this happens you can not type on the keyboard and there is no way to turn them off.The letters on this keyboard are extra small.Over the years I have had several Computers and this is the first one that the keyboard has quite working.To me this is just a junk keyboard.
1,Totally Non-responsive,"Well i read all the reviews on this bad boy and i decided to pick one up. Unfortunatly when I got it all set up and ready to roll i found out that the key board is dam near totally unresponsive to typing unless you press really hard on the keys. Anyone who plays MMORPGS espically PVP and uses the WSAD keys for movement does not want to walk 3 steps and then pause becase the dam ""W"" key wont respond for some dam reason. It's not just the w key by the way is all of them. My roomate jumped on the comptuer to take care of some business and even he told me that this key board sucks and to put my old one back on. Maybe i just got a bad key board maybe not. If i get wacked in game cool if i get wacked in game becuse i cant move my pc or fight because of an unresponsive key board very very uncool. Seriously if i could give this product a negative star i would."
2,bueno pero si funcionara bien,"prosnice lookgreat setup on keysmultiple keypress workscomfortableslimconVery Long keyboardit misses typed characters about 25% of the time, backspace is slow,I have about 70% accuracy with this keyboard"
2,Not as good as it looks,"Big keyboard, with wide key spacings. Nice for gaming but not so good for typing, repeated letters are a real problem and it takes some time to adjust to spacing.Big downsides are software and customer support. I have had repeted incompatability problems between Razer software and iTunes and Microsoft Outlook. I have only had the keyboard for a week but have had to reload software sevral times (seems to be the same problem I had with short lived Razer Death Adder Mouse).Razer also has awful customer support, they don't seem to acecpt returns of failed products. So if you buy from Amazon, hope that yours fails before Amazon's 30 days are up."
2,A Pretty big let down,"I was really excited to get this keyboard, now I wish I had bought something else.1. The whole keyboard doesn't light up. (but you probably knew that)2. It takes 2 usb ports just to run.3. Probably won't work until windows boots up. (good luck with your bios)4. The software for this thing is horrible. Seems razor is more interested in marketing and looking cool than producing something functional.5. Profile key is worthless. You should be able to set up 2 profiles and toggle between them with the profile key. I tried to setup a simple profile to disable the windows key. The only time it works is when the configuration program is loaded and running in the background.6. Home, end, delete pg up and pg down keys are not in a standard layout.7. It's expensive."
4,"Cool, but not what i expected","This is a pretty cool keyboard. I love the programmable keys and the program provided is pretty easy to use for making macro's or remapping the keyboard. It types really well and the keys have great response. Problems I have is that it takes two usb ports to plug in and for some reason the added usb ports on the keyboard itself wont work for me (says something about insufficient power). Also one of the keys stopped working, but that was easily fixed by removing the key with the tool provided and resetting it in place. Also, get a cable splitter for your audio cable if you want to use the headphone jack on the keyboard without having to unplug your existing speakers all the time."
1,Yuck!,"I did not like the scent of this cologne. It smelled good on my clothes, but it smelled like bug spray on me. I sent it back."
2,Craving indian curry,"I was hoping this was indian curry. I love indian curry because of the strong texture, taste and scent. This curry is quite spicy and does not need additional seasoning except for tomatoes and onions or other produce that will not affect the flavour."
4,Works but Shipping Can't be More than One Ounce,Bought it from an Amazon Market Seller. Price was low to make up for high shipping cost. I received the brand name promised and plastic is crisp and clear but I did notice that dust seems to be creeping up under the lower edge. I mainly use my ipod when traveling to listen to books-- latest car has an audio input jack so I don't have to fiddle with finding a clear FM stations any more-- so it gets exposed to a good amount of dust. If this bothers you then you should look at a sleeve type protector.
1,Description and image are deceiving,"When this product arrived I discovered it is not a Macally brand overlay. It is also not 1 piece that covers the front, back, and sides of the ipod. It is 2 individual pieces that don't even cover the whole front or back if my ipod.I specifically purchased this item because it covers all but the top and bottom of my ipod. I have had a genuine Macally ipod overlay (just like the one in the picture above) and was very pleased. This item has no brand name and in my opinion looks to be made of stiff brittle plastic that will crack easily. I am very disappointed."
3,A little tired,"These are cool episodes, but are really more of a recap of previous seasons. Each episode has a ""theme"" (i.e.: vegetables, or chickens) where they'll go back over previous episodes and tell new stories, but mostly using old footage. I do like this series, but this one seemed like they were trying to make more money from a series that was finished, like squeezing blood from a stone."
1,waste of money,"Waste of money, wouldn't recommened. Never worked correctly, however I brought omron hj303 has been working awesome for almost a year."
1,lack of insight,"Although well situated to recollect an important place and time in the history of the disability rights movement in the United States, the author fails to provide insight into the daily life of disabled people. This is particularly unfortunate as there is not an adequate amount of written material on the life of gay disabled people. The text is also poorly organized and the writing is terrible--the publisher or Panzarino should be embarrassed--a competent line editor could have improved the text significantly."
4,An ok goosebumps book,This book was good but it wasn't scary. There is a surprising twist at the end but I won't give it away.
3,VERY FUNNY SOMEWHAT CORNY NOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT SCARY FOR ME,"This book was pretty funny but for a goosebumps book it should have been scarier. as far as nine year olds go,they would probably like it alot,but if they are real goosebumps fans like i am then they will probably notice it is a bit too funny and a little less scary. i say for a seven year old this probably wouldent be scary let alone a nine year old. this wasent one of stine's best horror books!"
5,Another Original Idea,"The ending is great,the plot is original, and the whole thing really caught me offgaurd, in a goodway of course. Its the orginal goosebumps brought back. Don't let the negative reviews get you. This is a Goosebumps book worth reading."
2,My Best Friend Is Invisible is terrible,"An extraordinarily obnoxious book where nothing happens, every character is grating, and the final twist makes absolutely no sense, My Best Friend Is Invisible is reference-level terrible.The very simple reason why this book is so bad is because it displays utter contempt for its audience, to a degree extraordinary for even a Goosebumps book. The twist ending doesn't come out of left field, it comes from NOWHERE AT ALL. These are aliens who dress like humans, eat like humans (including the name-brand Frosted Flakes and Corn Pops cereals), keep cats as pets, have English first names, run track meets, have stuck-up librarians, and do Math in school. Hell, Sammy has a YANKEES jacket, for Christ's sake! (Insert Steinbrenner joke here.) This really is an insulting novel. Sucks how the Human species is endangered but cats are still thriving and seen as pets."
2,a kid's review: not recommended,"My sister collects this series, and sometimes I will read some of them. They are decent entertainment, with suspense and humor placed well. However they are all majorly over-dramatic and completely non-scary. This one must be the least scary and one of the most ridiculous of them.The only reason i give this 2 stars instead of 1 is the ending. One thing I enjoy most about this series is that each book has an unexpected surprise ending, and this one had a completely shocking and unprepared-for finish. So if you want to get a good surprise ending, go ahead at get this book. But believe me, you'll have to struggle to get to the finish."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I am an avid Goosebumps fan, but this one was just terrible. I struggled through it because, as another reviewer said, NOTHING HAPPENS. It almost literally bored me to tears, and it was a chore to finish it.We follow the protagonist through...regular days at school. The invisible best friend does a few entertaining things, but not enough to even come CLOSE to salvaging this book.As mentioned, there are references to brand names, sports teams, modern (at the time) technology, etc., yet the main characters are ALIENS with a pet cat. The twist that the invisible friend was a human was so jarring with the build up that it threw me right out of my suspension of disbelief.The characters themselves are flat, and lack even the basic likability you get in pretty much any other Goosebumps book.Save yourself the trouble and pick up ""Let's Get Invisible"" instead. At least that one had strong characters, a simple yet good concept, and an awesome twist."
2,Software Unusable,"While the manual is excellent, the most valuable features are on CD. The software ran with no sound and no controls, requiring rebooting the system to exit. I could never contact their support personnel, despite waiting 55 minutes on their non-toll-free number and being disconnected by their end twice. If you have a system which uses MS Windows 95, you might want to buy something else."
2,Didn't work on Yukon NVMT 4 x 50,"I got this to compliment the Yukon NVMT 4X50 that I got but when I put it on, it would not focus at all. The focus adjustment operated properly but there wasn't enough range to bring the image into focus. I put the 4X50 lens back on (which worked fine) and decided to send them both back. he NVMT is a decent Gen 1 unit so I think I'm going to order the Yukon Sea Wolf 3X42 and stick with that."
5,Great lens for sightmark too!,"I used this with a Sightmark Ghost Hunter 1x24 Night Vision Goggle Kit I also bought here on Amazon. It fits perfectly, same type of screw, however it took me a while to figure out how to properly detach the original 1x24 lens (I had to keep the adapter in). The quality is great for the price."
3,THE ATHARVA VEDA TREASURE OF SECRAD DEVINE LAWS,"the book is very nice.the auther tried to reveal the secret devine laws using hymes of atharva veda.His effort towords this is worth appreciation.But lot of work yet to be done.since quite long i am studying the vedas and this is the veda which i foud fully usefull in domestic life.it is the fountain of boons by which any person can lead to a happy and successfull life.he can get any material or spiritual thing ,he wanted.the fymes are mostly usefull in developping the humen personelty also;i congratulate the writer and expext him to go still further and get the medical and other life saving fruits for mankind."
3,Brought this when dancehall was cool,It's a cool video.I can't say that I still watch it. It's collecting dust on the shelf. I bought it when Sean Paul was at his height with dancehall/reggae. Now it's just a memory like krumping :(
1,price as posted,Surely the price posted is in error. On Wildlife-rescue & rehab. (their wish List) describes this item at a price of 29.99. Which is correct for this 32 gal. blazblu trash can?Thanks
3,Do your homework - compatibility issues,"I don't actually own this particular model but I do own a GoVideo R6740 DVD recorder. Here's the major thing potential customers interested in getting their first DVD recorder should be aware of (I bought one not knowing the following): the GoVideo units (as well as other lower-cost brands) only record on DVD+R/RW media, as opposed to DVD-R (notice the dash instead of the plus symbol). The DVD+R media will NOT play on any other machine besides the unit it was recorded on, even when finalized. However, the DVD+RW's (rewritables) will play on other machines but the unit is quite fussy about the brand of media you use, as I've had some problems with recording DVD+RW's giving me the ""Write Fail"" error message. The DVD-R/RW media is much more compatible with other players, so be forewarned. Otherwise, it's a fairly decent unit as a DVD player and as a recorder if you can live with the limitations I've mentioned."
3,good but die after 6 months,"I had a good time with it. However, it die after6 months. And I need to pay $70 to get a replaced one."
2,Not so good,Didn't care for the show. It seems like the characters overacted throughout the show. Just notot my cup of tea.
4,Brit To The Core,"Good plots, well acted, keeps u in suspense to the end. Intelligent without unnecessary gore and the Scottish accents make for a change."
4,English subtitles?,Does anyone know if these episodes have english subtitles? I would love to watch it but have a hard time with Scottish accents so subtitles would be mandatory.
4,slightly maddening,It's a nice enclosure once you've gotten your drive in and closed up but getting there is tedious and frustrating with tiny screws and washers that need to be placed with tweezers and holes that don't align with the drive's holes and needing either milled a little with a dremel tool or completely new holes drilled as for my one western digital drive. Then getting the halves aligned and holding the front plate in place while snapping those wrap around strips on will drive you to drinking if you haven't started already. But now that that's all over I like it.
4,Teaches a child about responsibility and Horses,Steve lives next door to a new fenced yard where 2 horses roam. He learns the good and bad parts of responsibility. A good read.
5,"Koopman, a genius","The articulation and emotion of this performance is wonderful. If you are looking for an authentic recording of one of Bach's greatest works, then this one is for you! You might also check out the other recordings of Bach done by Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque."
5,Excellent!,"The recording is excellent in every regard - audio fidelity, interpretation, quality of the chorus and soloists. Delivery from vendor was prompt. A very pleasing transaction."
4,Just the solution I was looking for,"After trying and giving up on Belkin's TuneCast II, I tried DLO's Transpod (White). At $100, it's expensive, but you can quickly forget that when you hear the sound quality. Things I like include the following:1. It uses the 12V power supply and charges the iPod while it's in use2. The multiple arms make it possible to fit almost any automobile3. The transmitter is powerful (overrides most stations even in the Bay Area). I've almost never had to switch stations4. You don't need to use the iPod volume control. The signal (fixed line out) is directly tapped from the multipurpose socket at the bottom of the iPod.Negatives:1. No user defined memory settings2. No aux-in inputs for non iPod devicesBoth these features are provided in the new model - in my opinion, that's a better model to choose."
2,Decent but there has to be a better solution somewhere out there!,"I recently received an iPOD Photo and after loading in tons of CD's I said . . . hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car. My transpod arrived but I had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car's charger. After working that out and using it everyday for a week, it stopped working. I realized that the fuse had blown. It's small and relatively compact unlike the Griffin RoadTrip, but it's a whole lot of drama for the price.With regard to the quality of the sound through my vehicle's audio system, I am extremely disappointed. What sounds like a million dollars through headphones does not translate to what you hear through fm radio frequencies. I have adjusted the iPOD's equalizer and played around with some options inside my car, but I am extremely disappointed. If someone has a better alternative . . . GOD BLESS YOU but don't waste your money on this product."
5,Excellent view of the Old South,I was really impressed with the unbelievable wealth knowledge Professor Oakes brings to light in this book. I recommend it be used in high schools throughout the country. Everyone should have access to this information. I knew him from Northwestern University. Thanks Dr. Oakes.
3,Painted Lady,"Heln Murrin's ""Painted Lady"" is a diffent type of Helen Murrin movie. I would call it her ""first detective"" experience. It's good but you have to be willing to look at her in another deminsion. Also, the ending is just that--it ends. You're left with the feeling of ""OK, now what?"""
2,Good performances can't rescue preposterous storyline,"I'm usually a big Helen Mirren fan, and I love British mysteries, but geez Louise if this isn't one of the least believable, most convoluted things I've ever seen. Mirren plays Maggie Sheridan a formerly successful blues singer, who goes undercover as a Polish countess art expert to investigate the death of her mentor/father figure. One minute she's got a nose ring and is sleeping with a scraggly rock star wannabe, the next she is flirting with Italian millionaires and bidding on Goyas. The ease with which you believe such a transition could occur is likely to highly influence your viewing experience. The pace is leisurely, the plot meandering, the payoff underwhelming. Watch Prime Suspect instead if you want to see Mirren in a mystery."
2,Are you kidding?,"This movie is a testimony to the fact that sometimes a film is made solely because someone is infatuated with a particular face; in this case Helen Mirren's. The person infatuted was, apparently, the writer, Allan Cubitt. This film is little more than a camera slavishly following Mirren around with a lot of close-up's.In this film Mirren is an ex-rock star who ""plunges"" into the crime underworld to track down the killers of her benefactor. How are we supposed to believe this story line when at a crucial juncture Mirren's character almost misses a critical appointment due to oversleeping a one-night stand with a musician friend she runs into one evening.Long, tedious, stupid."
1,The adult section of the Library,"I think Helen Mirren is a great actress and for her to do a movie like this!! My 1 star rating was generous as it was awful and had no plot at all, unless I missed something. Would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Challenging the Bible,If you haven't read Robert G. Ingersoll and you are a freethinker then you need to get some of his books. He was a man way ahead of his time and so easy to read he was an excellent speaker and it shows in his essays.
3,Prefer Cosa Bella Gloves - Too Clunky!,"I bought these. They seem VERY sturdy...however, they are VERY clunky - can't grip anything wearing these. Also, they are TOO short! Water will get up your sleeve.I really prefer the Cosa Bella gloves. They fit nicely, and pull all the way up."
2,Holy gloves!,"I love the gloves, but I've bought two pairs, and I keep getting small holes that let in water when I'm washing dishes. I can't use latex because of allergies, but I need a glove that can last longer than a month!"
5,good gloves,"could use a longer cuff, but they do last a long time. a month and counting, that is using them every day."
5,excellent product,excellent product. I can not find anything similar. I only buy these gloves now for my hands when I do washing since I use very hot water.
5,Great Dish Gloves!,"These are the best dish gloves! Unfortunately I can't find them locally, but I am glad that Amazon.com has them available."
3,Decent gloves but a bit slippery,"Got these gloves for myself and my wife. We've had similar gloves and they've been great. They are sturdy, thick and keep your hands dry. The only thing I don't like about this particular pair is that there isn't a very good grip on them. The finger section is rough but things have often slipped out of my hands particularly when I use soap. Not very good if you are washing fine china or crystal. Maybe it takes time for them to break in or the material is faulty. Slightly disappointed though. Most gloves I've had haven't had this kind of issue. It's still usable but I have to be very cautious and I simply don't use them when washing something delicate."
1,Smelly & Moldy,"I bought and used this gloves on daily basis from Nov 2012. Even after cleaning the gloves, the inside are very smelly and moldy. My hands stink after every dish washing.Spending $10 on a pair of gloves that last for 2 months, the gloves are over rated for their quality.No, I would not buy this gloves again."
5,Indispensable,"I always keep a set of these gloves around to do the pots and pans that don't go in the dishwasher... it's so much easier to clean them using what would otherwise be scalding hot water without having to worry about my hands being burned... the lining really insulates your skin from the temperature, but yet they are thin enough to feel what you are doing. They are also invaluable when using chemicals in the garden or garage."
5,True Blue's Are Truly the Best,"I just ordered these gloves. They are the 2nd pair I have owned (but I have worn them out) & they are the best out there. I have a small hand so the ""smalls"" fit great & I can use super hot water to wash & not feel any heat through them. I would recommend these to anyone who does any kind of housework."
5,If Batman made Kitchen Gloves,then it would be these. I am more excited about these than I should be for dish gloves. I have a hard time finding XL gloves and these fit perfectly. Much thicker than yellow playtex gloves (which always tear easy). These feel good and sturdy with a little bit of comfy thrown in.
3,not any better than Casabellas,"I bought these instead of the Casabellas that I usually use - just to give them a shot. My main problem with the kitchen gloves is that they end up with holes in the fingers and get water inside - which drives me crazy. I thought these being thicker would last longer... But I was wrong. So, they're pretty much the same quality (for me) in terms of longevity."
4,The best glove for chemical allergies,I've struggled to find gloves that don't irritate my hands. I have both a latex and vinyl allergy which cost me food jobs in the past. My contact dermatitis has since spread and need absolute protection which these provide. They still give some irritation but its better than tight fitting latex or vinyl gloves.
3,"Good, but slippery","It took me awhile to decide to buy these, as some reviews call them very ""grippy"", an some call them slippery. I received them yesterday, and after putting them on it's hard to believe that they could be slippery, but sure enough, as soon as they are in the water, they are indeed pretty slippery. Otherwise they seem like pretty good gloves - they slip on easily, the XL fits my big hands well, and they are comfy to wear, and they seem pretty heavy-duty - like they'll last a while.In short, they are pretty good gloves, but I'll have to be a little careful when washing dishes as they are slippery when wet."
3,Don't Buy to Wash Dishes,"While the gloves are textured in the finger and palm area for grip, they are crazy slippery when they come into contact with liquid dish soap. This is my 4th pair of durable vinyl gloves, the last being a no-brand pair from Target, and the pair before that from Williams-Sonoma. Neither of those had this problem. Had I not thrown away my last pair (right glove leaked) I would have reused the left glove.These gloves are still well made and durable, so that's why I give them 3 stars."
3,9 fingers out of 10,"On the day after the Return window closed for this item, a hot spot developed on one of the fingers. I don't have a dishwasher, so gloves are a mainstay of my kitchen. Other than this unfortunate (and painful) flaw, these gloves are the best I've found so far. But I'll keep looking for a perfect 10."
3,Not worth the extra cost,"I bought these hoping they would last longer than the cheap latex gloves I buy at the discount store hoping they would last a long time. I was replacing my cheap gloves between every two weeks and a month. Based on previous reviews, it sounded like these would last me a long time so I was willing to spend the extra money (ten times what I spend on cheap gloves). I was so disappointed when they got a whole after two-three weeks of washing dishes. I might as well just replace my cheap gloves. As far as performance, I liked them and so am giving them 3 stars but based on durability, at least for washing dishes, they deserve one star."
4,Great gloves,"These gloves are great for one who has latex allergies or sensitivities. Very durable, and I like the fact that I can launder them if needed. They run tight, so order a size larger than you would normally wear."
5,"A strong, durable, well fitting glove.",I ordered these gloved to use at work. The gloves we have are not good for dexterity and gripping things. We work with hydraulic fluid and machine parts. These gloves have an exellent surface for grippng things when they are wet and or oily. They are thick but not too thick as to impedeworking with tools. They fit very well. I bought medium. I will definitley buy these again.
1,not true to size,"I ordered the small size but they are huge! I never had the same problem with other small size gloves. Also, the material is too thick and stiff, feels weird on."
1,Did not work for me,"I was so excited to receive these, as they are cotton-lined, but when I put them on, they were thick, bulky, and stiff. They did not grip the plates on the hand section, but my the wrist section (shiny part) gripped the sink, making it difficult to use these gloves. I have to admit, I could stick my hand in really hot water, but I couldn't bend my hand easily, making for poor plate-washing. I'd rather use the Playtex Handsaver gloves and use warm water. HOW FRUSTRATING!!"
1,Not sturdy at all.,"I am very disappointed in these gloves. I thought they would last me longer than the thin, yellow Playtex gloves, but they haven't at all. I've had them less than 2 months and there are already holes in 4 separate fingers. I've only been using them for dishwashing, nothing harsh or unusual. A very disappointing purchase."
2,Too Slippery For Dishes,"My husband gets tired of the way supermarket dish gloves rip after just a few days of use, so I thought these sturdy gloves would be a good solution. I especially loved all the different colors they come in. However, although it doesn't appear to be smooth, the surface of these gloves is not nearly grippy enough for doing dishes. He's already chipped two plates that practically flew out of his hands while wearing these gloves. Back to the drawing board..."
2,find something besides dishwashing for these,"These gloves are advertised here as having an ""Amazing grip"". The only thing that amazes me about the grip is how slippery they are when wet. They are therefore terrible for dishwashing. You might still like them for other uses, especially if you keep your hands dry and clean every time you wear them, so that the inner lining doesn't deteriorate as quickly."
3,Slippery When Wet,"These are supposed to be dishwashing gloves or gloves to get wet with. When I did the dishes the first time with these, the dishes I was washing kept running from me. I broke a couple glasses after realizing it was the gloves not my clumsiness. I have a system now with how to grab them but what a joke to have to be this careful with gloves. I do like them because the scalding hot water to sanitize my dishes would melt my other gloves."
5,great True Blue gloves,These gloves are amazing. They protect against the hottest water and do not tear or leak. They last a long time too.
4,The inside is easy to get and stay wet.,"They are very good and tough gloves. Every thing about them except the inside. Make your hands are dry clean and free before using them. The inside has a cloth like linen inside so try not to store them when their wet from the inside. When washing, I usually machine wash them and latter throw them in the dryer. Air drying takes a while depending on how wet they are inside. Very good gloves and perfect for cleaning bathroom's."
2,P U!! Smells like a sweaty bear...,"I loved these gloves at first. They don't have great dexterity, but they are durable. But the fabric lining gets a stench that is hard to describe after a while. At that point, I have tried everything to clean them and nothing works or only works a day or so. Who wants to be cleaning the inside of rubber gloves every day?Either eliminating the lining or making a removable lining would work better. If there was no lining, you could just use a pair of Playtex inside the glove and it would be all around a great product for heavy duty chores.Nuff said."
3,Grippy? Or Slippery?,"I've got a pair of these gloves that I've worn for probably five years now to do dishes in winter when my hands dry out. I liked their comfort, insulating power, the fact I could pick up pretty small objects easily, AND that they had a good grip even on glass in sudsy water.Then I tried to replace them. The new ones have all the same qualities except that they're very slippery.So what gives? I am guessing they either reformulated the material they make them from, or maybe the different colors represent different forumulations for different purposes? (My first pair was blue; the replacements are green). Am looking for a way to check this but can't find any info about the manufacturer.Meanwhile I'm really uneasy trying to use the new ones for dishes - so far no breakage, but it's just bound to happen sometime."
3,Green Version is Slippery!,"Be careful! The green version is very slippery! While washing dishes, I went to pick up a drinking glass. The glass is smooth, no designs or anything fancy. Just a plain drinking glass made by Libbey, similar in shape to theArc International Luminarc Specialty Pub Glass, 16-Ounce, Set of 12. As I gripped the glass, it slipped UP out of my hand. I also have the blue version and it works great! Don't go green! For these gloves I mean.I've had the blue version for about five months and they still work great. The lining makes it easy in and easy out."
2,NOT for dishwashing!,"I purchased these gloves to use for washing dishes. They are very thick, inflexible, and do not grip dishes. These gloves would be best used to scrub floors where manual dexterity is not required."
4,Wonderful for dish washing,"I've always used rubber gloves while washing dishes. The kind I was using (the common yellow ones) were not heavy duty enough. They only lasted about a month before they needed to be replaced. The True Blues are soooo much better. They are very thick, so you can use extremely hot water while washing. Also, they are not at all porous so water does not seep in and cause mildew. I've have these for about 4-6 months and am nowhere ready to replace them yet. The only flaw is that they are a little bit shorter than I would like. I thought they would make me clumsy while washing, because they are thick, but I've had no difficulties. I definitely recommend them."
4,You can find better car-seat for the same price,This cat seat is good but if you compare other car seats in similar price range then you will find better car seat then this. Also this car-seat is for 22-80 lbs. weight not for 20-100 lbs weight like other car-seats.
1,P-lease,"Give me a break. This album show none of the originality of old. I find it to be a terrible buy, please though look at their other releases because there are simply wonerfull"
3,Complete set CD review of Bach,"I discovered Bach organ music 40 years ago. I love Bach, everything he wrote. I have 4 complete sets of Bach organ recordings. Marie Claire-Alan is my favorite organist of everyone I have heard. I met Marie and her husband in person after a performance she gave in Chicago. I have 2 complete sets of Bach organ played by Marie. One is on records and the other the new CD set. She is a little older now when she recorded the CD's. The albums have a more youthful sound to them, a little more energy and different registration selection on the organs. I love Marie in her youthful recordings more than these. I love the albums so much I will digitize them and listen to them over the new CD collection. I play the albums on my Linn turntable through McIntosh equipment."
2,People are being misled. Maltitol is not diabetic-safe.,"It amazes me that maltitol continues to be marketed for diabetics despite the fact that it raises blood sugar almost the same way sugar does.That information is not hard to find; it's no secret. And yet product after product using maltitol claims that it is sugar-free(technically true) and ""diabetic-friendly"" (absolute rubbish).Be warned, people. Maltitol isn't your friend, and you may as well be eating table sugar for all the good it will do your blood sugar levels."
1,why?,"Why is this an import when it was live in Long Island.....????if it an inport, it means it has been illegally copied from VHS to DVD and is against the law in the USA..Amazon???? you cant be that stupid or could you???if you are, then I will start selling my boot leg dvd's in here also."
5,A great show! Should be on DVD!,"This concert shows Billy at his peak, in my opnion. Great songs and a brilliant perfomance! My dad had this on laserdisc and, every now and then, the whole family would sit down, pop some popcorn, crank up the volume and watch this together. It was the only music that the whole family could agree on! It's one of best memories of my youth. I sure wish I could relive the experience now on DVD!"
1,It ain't Billy... It's the DVD,"I own the original Sony beta hifi video of this concert and it truly is the best recorded show of its kind, period! The audio is great, the video is as good as beta could be (which was better than VHS). So with DVD being out forever, it would seem that the issuing studio would release this amazing concert on DVD for all of us fans. Not so. Originally released by Fox Home Video, no one seems to be taking responsibility for putting the DVD version out. I personally contacted the director and the producer of this video and each of them told me the people to talk to were Fox. I did try to contact Fox Home Video but no one returned my calls. I did buy the DVD on this page and it's a piece of junk. The picture quality is whack and it's off aspect--4:3 spread to 16:9. The audio is about the same as my beta hifi version. I'm surprised Fox haven't taken notice and jumped on the opportunity to release this jewel in an improved form. Surely, the master tapes are in their vault."
1,Don't Buy this DVD,This DVD looks like someone just took the VHS video and put it on DVD.Not worth the time or money to spend on it.It was a total disappointment so save your money.
2,Cheesy Copy Made From Old VHS Tape,"As others have mentioned, this DVD appears to be mastered from an old VHS tape, complete with the little silver lines in the picture that VHS tapes get when they have dropouts. Picture detail is about as sharp as a VHS tape, too. This concert was also released on LaserDisc way back when, but nooooo, for this DVD they used an inferior VHS tape instead.One thing I've NOT seen mentioned is, this concert was recorded on standard definition video with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This DVD plays at a 16:9 aspect ratio, presumably stretched horizontally to fill new widescreen TV's. So Joel and the band all look a bit short and fat throughout the concert unless you can play with the output settings of your player.Sound quality fares much better, especially on the DTS track.But since I still have my LaserDisc player, I think I'm going to go hunting for the old LaserDisc version of this concert instead of keeping this P.O.S."
5,Excellent concert.,"This is on my ""must own"" list with Ben Folds Five ""The Complete Sessions at West 54th"". It's as good as watching ""Get Back"" on the ""Let it be"" movie. It's one of those classics like Clapton playing ""Wonderful Tonight"" on SNL. In case you can't tell, I like it!"
4,Great shoes!,They look very nice on and are very comfy. The only thing... be careful with the size you order when you buy them. I'm a 7 1/2 but with these shoes I should've gotten 1 size or at least half a size less.
2,Caveat Emptor,"Frankly, I think Evans the perfectionist would be mortified if he knew this was put out as a record, no matter how well intentioned. The sound quality is pretty awful, and the performances were clearly never meant to be heard outside the pianist's apartment.Could be of value to other players attempting to get inside Evans' head and fingers; not for the casual listener, or even for the appreciator of what Evans might have been trying to preserve by not putting out performances this ragged."
1,Show more respect to Bill.,"Although the incomplete takes in this CD are all marvelous, this is what Bill Evans did not want to happen. Whenever his record was released, Bill carefully chose the best take of the songs which is appropriate for publication. Bill did not even put out many of the absolutely fine complete takes which he thought was not appropriate for publication according to his high standard. Bill was also notorious for his rejection to the recommendations of playing money making pop songs in 70s. Bill tried hard to preserve his high quality music throughout his career.What his son did for money making here gravely put off Bill Evans. I am sobbing for poor Bill."
3,TRIAL AND RETRIBUTION SET 2,It was o.k. I would not recommend it I thought it was too brutal and the murder scenes too gory.
3,Entertaining? Yes. It will astound you that cases are closed in spite of this team...,"To be fair, I've only watched this through Series 3. Perhaps the show runners decided to take a bit more effort in coming up with their plot twists, but I doubt it. So far I have seen jaw-dropping moments of profound stupidity normally reserved for slasher-movies. I think that's the reason why ""T&R"" has such short series (2 eps - 1hr 40 min each), there's no way people this inept could close more than two cases a year. This show is a nice queue filler, good enough to watch via your subscribed service, but if you pay anything more to view it YOU will be looking for justice. Really, ITV couldn't spend any more money on the truly excellent ""Wire in the Blood"" but they commissioned another series of THIS? BTW, Amazon should try to clarify just what is in these ""sets"". Is it one series or two?"
1,Pooh Paradise Bucket Seat Cover,"I am very disappointed in this product. The cover I installed on the passenger side ripped at the seam as I was installing it and the driver's side seat cover is starting to tear on the seams, too. I was unable to get the passenger's side cover to work correctly on the seat so it is skewed. Every time I get out of the driver's side the cover slides with me. Clearly, these seat covers are not going to last very long. I would not recommend this product."
3,Bought for Grandaughter,"I bought these for my grandaughter's first car, a 1999 VW. It took some effort to get them on the seats, however, once they were on they looked fine. She loves them."
3,Nice Seat Cover,Nicely made seat cover. The only downside is the cover doesn't match the instuction sheet. Doesn't fit very well.
3,"Very cute, the quality is not that great.","I've had these seat covers for a few weeks now. It fit ok (not as perfect as on the picture), I have a toyota corolla 2005. A lot of effort to put them on. The material is already breaking apart in the middle where the back and the botton seat meet, I only weight 105 pounds."
2,not what I expect,"The second day it started to unstitch in the middle. I am not fat, I weight 115 pounds."
4,Overall: Good,"The first, eighth, and eleventh tracks on this CD were awesome. It was one of the best recordings of Conzertstuk I've ever heard. The second movement to Mozart's 4th was superb, and Corette's horn quartet was equally superb. However, the rest of the songs (while good) weren't of the best recording quailty. But the playing remained magnificent. I would definitely reccomend this one to any horn afficionado."
4,Fabulous French Horns,"I am not a musician, but a music lover and just happened to stumble upon this magnificent CD by accident. I am now an avid fan of the french horn. If you can get your hands on a copy, buy it! Enjoy."
1,"Excellent Selections, Bad playing","This CD on the Erato label has many great selections including the rare Konzertstuck for hour horns in orchestra. However, the performers play with too much vibrato, particularly on the pieces from the classical era. Even though the collection includes the incredible Konzertstuck, it is played most poorly, with a very obvious crack on the high E. If you want an alternate recording of the Konzertstuck, there is a phenomenal one with Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony on the Delos label. If it is the Mozart concerti you want, I suggest the classic Dennis Brain recordings. If you really enjoy the sound of vibrato on a horn, then get this CD. You will not find horns that play with more vibrato than these guys."
2,I don't like this one,"I'm a french horn student in Cleveland. I listened to this CD when I was with my friend in Turkey (I'm from Turkey). I didn't like it, neither did my friend. Pieces that they play are nice but the way they play didn't satisfy me. I've heard better recordings of most pieces in this CD."
3,Good product,"Decided to give TVP a try, product arrived in a timely matter, I made what I called this-is-not-your-mama-meatballs end product was pretty good the reason why I gave it only 3 stars is because the nutritional values a a bit of a mistery... I tried to research it on google but to this day I'm not sure the calories contents"
4,"TVP, 1 pound","This is a good product. I can't buy this locally, so it is nice to be able to try it from Barry Farms. I used it in some chili and in hamburger helper and it turned out very tasty, I can see using this in lots of different recipes. It was also good in dirty rice."
3,Full of chemicals,"Full of chemicals, zinc oxide, niacinamide,ferrous sulfate, copper gluconate, vitamin A, Palmirate, calcium pantothenate, and 3 other synthetic vitamins.Are these all Fortified nutrition? if not what the reason for them.Label DOESN'T say non GMO. Amazon web page says its non GMO. Have to go with label.Soy based, Amazon didn't say it was Soy. Soy has been knocked down lately as having too much estrogen.Use small amounts and infrequently.If U don't mind soy, and don't care about GMO, It still would loose 2 stars for the chemical crud. Too bad could have been 4 stars.This company has problems with labeling, out of 6 Items I bought 3 had labeling issues."
4,laughin my butt off,I ordered the four complete series of Martin for my husband's birthday...there is only one or two dvd's in the bunch that will not play on our dvd player however we still view the rest of the dvd's on a daily basis...can't wait till the 5th season comes out but that's when martin and gina were going through their lawsuit so it may not come out...any we're very pleased...holla
5,Excellent!,Excellent packaging and fast shipping. Love the Martin series I had to get all 5 seasons this was one to help complete my library. Excellent and funny and will watch all 5 over and over.
3,SOS Parent Help,"This is a good, basic book for parents in need of learning how to bring discipline to their children/child. For me, looking for help with ADHD behaviors, I didn't find a lot of new information, but review never hurts!"
2,Disappointing,"This book is for parents who have never done any basic reading on parenting philosophies and haven't picked up a copy of ""Parenting"" magazine in the last five years. The book is simplisitic and focuses almost exclusively on how to give time-outs. I was disappointed - hoping for something more insighftful and thoughtful."
5,Informative,I found this book to be quite informative. Of particular interest to me were: Grandma's rule and the use of tokens.
1,impractical and condescending,"This is an attempt to impose strict behavior modification concepts which were dated in the 1950s. It may work in institutional settings for limited children, but the use of tokens fails miserably with any spirited child. The application of these ideas is impractical in real family life, especially if there is more than one child. A waste of paper."
3,SOS for Parents,"SOS for Parents is a classic explaining the one/two/three, time-out method of discipline for children. It is an excellent choice for parents not familiar with the method who need a thorough introduction. However, if you are looking for a broad range of approaches to discipline or discussion of medication or discussion of extremely difficult behavior or ages and stages and how to figure whether your child's behavior is within the range of normal for his or her developmental stage, this is not the book. It simply presents the one approach."
2,Had to Return,"We were unable to use mount in the location we needed (when tv positioned flat against the wall it would have overlapped our brick fireplace). However, the installers stated it was a cheaply made product. They were shocked by the price we paid and said they would not recommend using it even if had ""fit"" our requirements."
1,Horrible,What the Hell Was that so called singer thinking?!!! I sound more like Maynard than that fag!
1,Hmm,"although i don't actually have this, i'm basing my review on the clips here. vocals aside, it sounds spot on. but vocals in mind... wow... so basically they just need a different singer and then they have something going for them."
3,For Armstrong completists only,"After seeing this film, which had literally maybe five minutes of score, I wondered how an album could possibly be made from so little music. What we get will satisfy nobody. There are short cues from the film, with dialogue over them, alternating with lengthy pieces inspired by the film to fill out the running time.Fans of the film have no need for this CD, since most of the music wasn't in the film, while fans of Armstrong's music will be disappointed by the intrusive dialogue. Why is it that, since Pulp Fiction, so many soundtrack producers think leaving dialogue over the music is somehow ""cool."" If I wanted that, I'd have just snuck a tape recoder into the theater. What film music fans like me want is to hear the music on its own.A disappointment, though with some lovely pieces here and there."
5,interesting and necessary for good lecture presentations,Good ideas in order to reveal scientific knowledge for a all kind of audience.It is an essential book for those teachers who use the lecture method. The lessons become more alive because of demonstrations that are very carefully prepared in many technical aspects.
4,a little chatty but quite interesting to read,I've been thinking about how to improve students' scientific presentation and find this book very useful. The author occasionally slips in quite a few interesting stories of some famous scientists. Quite an enjoyable reading experience.
5,my favorite book on presentations,The advice is so straightforward and easy to follow... it's like a cookbook for scientific presentations but I think anyone who gives project reports would find it useful.
5,An excellent basic reference.,"If 1/3 of a page and one photo for each ship is enough info for you, this is an outstanding quick reference. I only wish the author had included a few significant ships of under 15,000 tons, and with the recent spate of very large new cruise ships, the book is slightly dated. A cross-reference list of sister ships might also have been welcome. No matter; this is still one of the most heavily-used books on my shelf."
3,Not what I expected,"I think the book covers a lot of ships and liners, but is very poor in description. It only states basic characteristics. I have to admit I expected more..."
2,Forces of Evil,This was the first book I read by the author. The plot was okay. The romance of the two characters was not described in depth nor was the relationship. There was no love scenes to describe the warmth of the relationship between the two main characters. We know there was a relationship between the two because the author wrote of one but nothing described their love or how they displayed it other than some kissing and hugging. I was disappointed in that aspect. I could not get into the characters or how deep their feelings were. Wasn't a very good lesbian romance.
3,Beautiful recording except for the Soprano soloist,"This is my absolute favorite piece of choral music and I was very excited when I started listening to it. I got it because I wanted a newer higher quality recording. The balance between chorus and orchestra is perfect - something so difficult to find with a chorus and orchestra of this size. I love the tempo. However it has one major flaw that frankly ruins this entire album, and that is the quality of the Soprano soloist. There are so many places that where her intonation is 1/4 tone or more off that I was shocked it made it onto a professional recording. Her climactic note in the Libera Me, the most shimmering note in the entire piece, is a full 1/2 tone off. I was so dismayed. It's such a shame because the rest of the soloists are amazing, especially Placido Domingo."
1,Never Read It,I bought this to help with teaching my Newspaper class but it's not a very engaging book. I didn't get through the first chapter and it wasn't for lack of effort.
3,"Great finish, no start.","I read this book as a first year grad student studying journalism. It's an interesting read - probably the only book I read that whole semester that I actually liked. It leaves the reader with a sense of purpose and commitment to the craft of journalism.Then I went out and start reporting in the real world. I immediately realized ""Elements of Journalism"" is hopelessly idealistic. The book has a great vision for where the profession should be, but no suggestions on how to get there."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book as a follow-up to his book ""Intercessory Prayer"". With the exception of one amazing WWII story, this book was comprised mostly of material from the earlier book. This author has a pleasant writing style, and is easy to read, but I felt cheated with this book. ""Intercessory Prayer"" is phenomenal, this one's a dud ):"
3,"Excellent range, crystal clear, clumsy interface","Highs: Works clearly even in the house next door, light up keypad, ringer volume. Lows: Shrill ring, cumbersome memory programming, clumsy CID interface ( deleting a chore )."
1,This is not a good phone,"In the past year I've tried to buy a cordless phone that has the features I want and good quality too...this Uniden was the worst cordless and the most expensive. First of all, the long cord that plugs the phone into the jack didn't work. I spent hours trying to figure out why it wasn't working and then tried the very short cord...it worked. The sound is terrible, fades out and there is a very annoying almost constant clicking sound and a noticeable echo when I'm talking. Last but not least, the phone doesn't ring when it's plugged into the charger. Save yourself the annoyance and don't bother with this phone."
2,One major drawback,I've had the Uniden EXR2460 for about a month now. I love everything about this phone EXCEPT the microphone on the handset. You get a very noticable echo of your voice through the speaker. It's very annoying.Take a look at some of the reviews for the other cordless Uniden phones and you'll see echos (no pun intended :) of the same problem.
3,all I really wanted was the cable,"After losing one cell phone and another dying on me, I wanted an easy way to back up my phone numbers. The ability to edit my phonebook and organize ringtones was important too. The Motorola version that was specific for my phone (V195) cost $50 ($30 for just the software) so I figured I had nothing to lose.This older and more general software works with my phone. It did require running the Search for Software Updates twice but eventually was able to detect my phone.I wish the address book editor was more robust (I have to copy an entry to my SIM card in order to edit), but it does allow me to backup my address book, edit entries and type/send text messages from my computer rather than the phone keypad."
3,Not what I expected,Misjudged what the content would be. Would not be interested in similar offerings. Will investigate further before making my next purchase.
3,intimate invasion/of enema play,"It was a good book, it had some great stories and how to use an enema.Anyone buying this book has done enemas or is interested in them.I feel you can learn more on your on web sites and get alot of info idea's about enemas and anal fun. I could write a book of 30 or more true anal and enema stories starting at the age of 5 yrs to now.I thank web sites for teaching me more about this fetish and may you all have happy endings with your new fetish."
2,This is considered erotic play?,"You will see in another posted review that M R Strict is indeed quite impressed with his own work. This book does contain some useful information, and the author goes into excruciating detail to describe the scenes and fantasies he writes about. If your idea of ""erotic play"" involves the use of enemas as a part of severe, humiliating physical punishment, then you may enjoy reading this book, although the internet is loaded with similar stories that are free. However, if you are more interested in giving or receiving enemas as a part of a caring intimate relationship, you'd probably be better off buying something else. Even better still, take some time and write your own story for your lover. You'll enjoy writing and he/she will enjoy reading it. Yes, I did read the whole book and, like another reviewer, I'll be destroying it soon."
3,There's not enough shots in the world,"I am looking for some different recipes for shots, but didn't find them here. We love to entertain with shots, but are quickly getting tired of the same 20-30 that we are both familiar with. Most of what I found in this book was already out there. I'll continue the hunt for new recipes. This would be a great book for someone just starting to get into making shots."
3,paint chips,we use this fairly often -- for about 3 years. the matte red paint chips off. this is a big problem only because we have a small chaild and i worry she will eat the paint.the paints started shipping where it got dented. then it shipped in other places. i worry that the inner coating might get conpromised because of the dent. is this an issue?i just got a glossy blue sigg bottle and we'll see if that paint also chips after a few years.
3,easy to dent,"these bottles are light weight and have no adverse taste associated with them. however, they are very easy to dent. i ordered two, one of which had a large dent when it arrived from amazon. the other was dented within two weeks. the replacement for the bottle that was dented on delivery was dented after just a few weeks."
4,D.I.T.C.'s Cohort comes hard with 2nd Lp of 05!,"WOWfirst of all what a treat! First O.C. drops Starchild import only Lp which was straight heat and not even 5 months later another brand spankin new album! Completely produced by Mike Loe , O.C. continues his elite lyrical skill on this lp from his rebirth (not to say bon appetit was weak but compared to his first 2 lp's it was weak) on his import only starchild album straight fire lyrics but instead of over soul beats more electrontic and hype melody type beats that really are complimenting to O when hes angry!!! Which on the majority of the Lp he is! A definate must own it looks like O.C. has started the re-up of the best group of all time D.I.T.C. 2 Lp's , Show droped an Lp , now there all recording solo's (finesse ,a.g.,diamond) and now there on a tour november and then recording a LONG awaited EP!"
4,Adequate,"O.C. has a resume that is certifiably impossible to live up to, and understandably, he doesn't really manage to do so with this record. The disc isn't bad, but when compared to either of his first two releases, it sort of fades into the background. There are only a couple of tracks that could be considered for radio release, and most of the album is spent ruminating on various and sundry inequities and inadequacies in the music industry, which, for underground fans, could start to drag a little at this point. For fans, I would certainly recommend this without hesitation, but for newcomers, Jewelz is probably a better place to start."
4,Best Blow Dryer,"I have thick, long and wavy hair. Even though I love my hair after it is blow dried it used to take over 30 minutes and I was usually hot afterwards. I purchased the Elchim and I can't believe the improvement. It reduced hair drying time dramatically and the settings are perfect. Also, it is quite, even on the highest speed. I would definitely recommend, especially with the attachments. The price is more than a drug store brand but you are paying for a professional piece and this will last you so much longer. I wish I could give this product 4 1/2 stars because my only issue is that it can get heavy so I have to switch my arms."
5,I've had this for 5 years and counting,The dryer has very strong airflow. I have had it for several years now and I just bought one for my mom.
5,Awesome Blowdryer!,"This blowdryer is awesome- my hair is shinier, softer, less frizzy after using this blowdryer. And to top it off my super thick wavy hair usually takes 45 minutes with the cheaper blowdryers and my hair was done in 20 minutes with this one."
4,Wife loves this dryer,Got this for my wife for Christmas because she said she wanted the hottest blowing dryer I could find.This one works great.
5,susan,"have had the same dryer for years and boy is the elchim a huge step forward. dries my hair qickly, easy to manuver and because i chose the red color it is kinda cool to use."
2,"OK, not up to full expectations","When the box arrived it was quite damaged and not a great presentation of the quality I thought was inside. I was so excited to receive this hairdryer, having tried many and never quite finding one that actually performs as a 'professional' dryer even though they may claim to be. Loved the idea that this was a classic, that people returned to, but on using the dryer can't really understand why. It overheats really quickly (thought only small cheap ones did that!) and looks like the buttons are in the wrong place i.e speed is the red button and temperature is the black one, wouldn't it make more sense the other way round? Have I been sold a cheap imitation???"
3,nice for the yacht but no good for constant walking,I haven't worn these very far due to the fit around the ankle. I'd rather have ankle length eastland loafers for women.
3,Don't buy!,I bought these about 3 weeks ago for a great price however they are already coming apart! I have only wore them about 5 times they shouldn't look the way they do already!!
3,A little narrow,"I have wide feet and I ordered the 11W size, however the shoes were still a little too narrow. And I just noticed that some of the stitching is coming loose on the side and I'll need to repair the shoes. I feel like the toe area is kind of narrow and long which I find a bit unattractive. Overall they are fairly comfortable (except for being a little tight). I can wear them all day."
3,"Great concept, pretty good toy","My 9 year old son had some difficulty with the instructions, but I don't think they are that hard, you just have to lay out the pieces like the pictures illustrate. The toy is pretty durable, but not like a lego toy. My son has a lot of fun with the toy and I would have to give it a high replay value."
3,Assembly nightmare,"Assembly of this toy with the directions provided is impossible. The age recommendation of 6+ is accurate for PLAYING with the assembled toy, but an advanced degree is required to ASSEMBLE it. I found two errors in the assembly manual which cause the toy to not stay together properly. After some trial and error, and disassembly and reassembly, my wife and I were able to get the toy together in a mere 3 hours. The unfolding garbage truck is cool, however, the parts of the lab, which end up on the ceiling and walls inside the truck fall apart easily. To be a good toy this one would need better assembly instructions and to not fall apart so easily."
5,Teens will read this!,"My daughter, who is not a reader, read this cover to cover in one sitting. My seventh grade students, their teachers and parents love it. All of our copies have waiting lists. Teens and adults involved with teens relate to Sean Covey's reflections and practical advice. This is a great conversation starter between teens and parents!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I've purchased bulk groceries thru Amazon for several years now. People don't buy cases of a product to be consumed in a few months so expiration dates ARE very important. I just read the expiration date on these...Feb 5, 2013. Had THAT been clearly stated on the product information, I would never have made the purchase. A short THREE month expiration period on a bulk purchase should be posted to consumers. Extremely disappointed."
3,If you like Dead Kennedys Check this out!,The only good songs on here are Jesus was A Terriorist and Ride the Flume. Both those songs freaking rule! The rest are in my opinion not good. They have slow grinding choppy seasawing beats and are too long.
5,"Funny in a silly, sick kind of way...","Akira is a normal guy who likes girls and computers and gets both in Mimi, a computer who looks like a girl. The DVD holds their adventures as they defend the internet, other female PCs and Japan against an invasion by evil American made personal computers which have huge...memory storage. Hehe. Lots of fun in only three episodes. Hint: The second the FBI warning shows up hit 'menu' otherwise the DVD seems to get stuck and won't even come out of the player.Even has a slide show and a blooper 'reel' where you get to hear the screw ups of the voice actresses and actors. Beware, lots of cussing but darn funny.This is one of the first anime DVDs I ever bought and I figured I needed to write a review on it. Wish there were more DVDs as funny, sexy and as well drawn as this one."
4,good but rushed,this anime would have been better with at least 6 episodes. being ony three made it feel rushed.it still was a good little show
1,Retired and inspired.,"I thought this would be a very interesting dvd that would detail with a degree of accuracy the Mayan calendar but found it very repetative, poor video quality and totally lousy.It seems more of a scam than a tool to improve ones knowledge of the mystery."
1,WHAT IGNORANCE!,When will people stop with all the UFO/ConspiracyTheory/superstitious ignorance?!?!? The maya calender was nothing more than a calender - a marvelous and impressive achievement without a doubt - but just a calender all the same. This video and all the other related ilk is no better than ignorant spittle from those too lazy to study the facts and accept the truth of science.I couldn't submit this reveiw without a star rating - it really deserves no mention/no stars.
3,Its OK,I purchased these shoes sometime ago. I must say this is the first rockport product that I can't say I loved it. Usually rockport shoes are pretty solid.These shoes were not very comfortable ven though the size was right.
3,Brief look at a great city,"The book is short, and $10 is way too much to pay for it. Still, if you can find a used copy, it does provide solid facts about events and people from Galveston's colorful past. Cabeza de Vaca, Karankawa Indians, Michael B. Menard, Jean Laffite, The Bolivar Ferry, the Galveston harbor, William L. Moody, Battle of Galveston (civil war), 1900 Hurricane, the seawall, the raising if Galveston Island, the Maceo crime family, Prohibition and various tourist attractions are briefly touched on. There are several black and white photographs, including maps and an interesting ""then and now"" section about historical landmarks."
4,A compelling read - particularly for Christians,"As in his book on the Copper Scroll, the depth and breadth of Feather's research is extraordinary, and the arguments regarding the possibility that Jesus and John the Baptist were Essenes at least during part of their lives, and the connections with Egypt, are very persuasive. For a Christian, I would imagine, the implications are mind-blowing.Future editions would benefit from more thorough Hebrew copy-editing (e.g. ""ribonim"" for pomegranates, ""Torah haMelech""), and the possible etymological relationship between the ancient Egyptian Ka-Ba-Akh with the Hebrew root q.b.r. seems questionable, but apart from that, for a layman such as myself, the reasoning seems hard to fault. Feather's explanation of the heavenly chariots in the mosaic floors of synagogues in the Galilee is certainly the most plausible one I've ever heard."
3,UNDELIVERABLE,"MESSAGE I RECEIVED:Dear John Jablonsky,Thank you for your order. The order did not go through because the order was to heavy to ship to APO address. We apologize for the inconvenience.J & RStacey Anderson(800)426-6027 Customer Service(800)221-8180 Sales"
3,They are speakers.,"The CNet review warned me, but I bought them anyway: There is hole in the frequency response in the 150 - 200 Hz range. What that means is that ""baritone"" sounds are weak. I spent time messing with the crossover frequency for the sub, (JBL recommends 100Hz) and I couldn't get a robust sound.Super low bass is huge as you want with the rather imposing sub, mids and up are fine with the seven similar monitors. Power handling is good for reasonable volume levels.The cabinets look good if silver and curvy is your thing.The included hardware and bracketry is extensive.I like the whole package, it's just that the overall sound is not as musical as I would like."
4,Powerful Surround Sound!!,"This product has been out for over a year but still remains a great deal at a great price with great sound to top it off! The subwoofer makes you feel like you're in the cinema (powerful base makes the floor vibrate - my kids love it). I found the set up easy enough - although there is a lot of wiring (that could have been marked to make it easier). Also the plastic stands for these heavy speakers are not sufficient and given how high the speakers are I laid some of them flat without using the stands because I was concerned they might topple. I also had to go out and buy two extension stands ($35 at Walmart for two and 25 cents for different screws and nuts to make them fit). All in all, I'm very satisfied and feel like I've moved into the world of high tech sound!"
4,If Jim Thompson were a Yuppie...,"If Jim Thompson were a Yuppie, he might have written this book.Bill Moss is a failed advertising exec living in Manhattan. Restarting his career as a telemarketer (for a lot less money), he and his co-workers are routinely humiliated by a petty and racist supervisor. But things get more tolerable for Moss when a chance lie he tells to the company's President results in a surprise promotion. Then he gathers enough courage to live out his long-time fantasy of an encounter with a 'lady of the evening'. Feeling guilty afterwards, Moss batters the woman.Then, when his boss threatens to fire him over an unrelated manner, Moss snaps. Now he's got a dead body in his office and a bunch of violent p imps chasing him. And things go downhill from there._Cold Caller_ is a seductively easy read that has several exquisite plot points. If you liked Thompson's _The Killer Inside Me_, I can almost guarantee you'll think as I do about _Cold Caller_: it's deliciously good."
2,THIS IS NOT NOIR!,"Word of warning, the book is 218 pages long, and the KEY event happens on page 120! That means that what you really have is 120 pages of SETUP. I did find the writing to good, and the observations reminded me of Bret Easton Ellis. The character of Bill Moss does have a bit of an American Psycho in him, a lot as it turns out. The book is promising, but to be defined as a NOIR, it is not, as a matter of fact, it falls way short of that."
3,How To Get Ahead In Business,"This book is somewhat reminiscent of the movie ""A Shock To The System"" starring Michael Caine. Isn't it terrible the way supervisors can thwart our ambitions to get ahead in the workaday jungle? In this instance our hero (?) takes the bull, or boss, by the horns, and shows him that he just won't take it any more. Life is indeed tough in the boiler rooms of the telemarketing industry. Not an outstanding book, but if you like noir novels this is a good one to add to your collection."
3,Works great 75% of the time,"I've had this keyboard/mouse for almost a year. For the first 6 months I really didn't have any problems, but lately I seem to be getting more and more interference. I've tried moving the receiver around, but this is just a temporary fix.Although it works fine most of the time, it is incredibly aggravating when the mouse starts moving erratically or the keyboard isn't recognizing all of your keystrokes."
3,Good but needs safter keyboard keys,"Prior to this keyboard I used the wired ""natural"" keyboard from Microsoft. The wireless feature is great especially since I don't have to worry about the cord getting tangled with my desk phone or mouse. The mouse is VERY good and it has a great feature that let's you customize each of the buttons for several programs. The keyboard feel however, is not as soft as some of the other keyboards I have tried. I though I would get used to it but I have not. Softer keys would make it very good for now, it is only good."
3,"Some good, some bad.","Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this. It's quiet, comfortable and reliable. There are a couple of things to be aware of, though:1. The middle mouse button is VERY stiff and hard-to-use. I use this all the time in my work, and this is a big problem. Not only that, but it only registers a click about half the time.2. The scroll wheel is a little flaky. It works, but it often ends up selecting a bunch of text in the process. As a disclaimer, I'm mostly using Linux (no drivers for this mouse), but I've never had a mouse do that. The same thing happens in Windows without the drivers installed. YMMV.3. I don't like the arrangement of the ""Home/End/Delete/Page Up/Page Down"" cluster. The traditional layout is a lot easier to use, in my mind.4. The ""Shift"" key seems a little sticky. For instance, when I type ""~/"", I often end up with ""~?"", even though I released the shift key just before hitting the ""/"" key.Other than that, this is a pretty good setup."
4,Worth the Money,"I have two of these,It took me some time to get use to the keyboard bing that I'm visually Impaired, but all in all, I love this purchase. Some of the Function keys do not work as expected hence the 4 stars. I did have some issues with the Mouse when only the USB plug was used, I connected both the plugs to my tower and the problem was solved. If you have a New Dell PC that does not come with PS2 ports you will need to get an adapter which allows you to connect the two plugs into one with the transceiver. Problem solved.I did notice that the keypad on the keyboard did not function when connecting with a Sony Vvio laptop running Windows Vista, could not solve that issue to date."
1,"Started out great, but pooped out at the end","The product has some great features, but several months ago, it started giving chronic low-battery and low-signal strength warnings even though I had just changed the battery and the receive is in direct line-of-sight and less than a foot away from the mouse. It also started acting erratically, acting as if buttons were pushed (on the mouse) that we not. NOW, on the keyboard, I can't even make capital letters because the combination of shift and a letter ends up producing nothing instead of a letter (it's very frustrating to type now). When working properly, it's great, but Microsoft doesn't stand behind its products (90-day warranty, they were unwilling to replace it within the year, and their warranty language on the site is very hard to figure out)."
4,Has annoying flaws,"This product works fairly well, but it has some minor annoying flaws. One of which is a pop-up saying the wireless mouse batteries are low and need to be replaced. In fact, they have never (so far) been drained. The batteries are fine.Having said that, I wouild grade this wireless optical keyboard/mouse combo to be well worth the cost. I would recommend it...and forewarn about this, and other, minor annoyances."
4,Microsoft Wireless Keyboard and Mouse,"I gave it 4 stars because wireless keyboards and mice are way over priced, if I hadn't needed an Ergo Keyboard, I would never have pay th price. I had some trouble installing it, I installed, uninstalled, reinstalled, final got it to work! If you need an Ergo Keyboard you'll have to pay the price!"
4,"Works fine, but . . .","The products work fine, but the keyboard has oddly roughed up key surfaces with somewhat transparent plastic making the entire unit look and feel dirty right out of the box. It took some getting used to and I still wish it weren't made that way. I also wonder why the keys in the front row are so large. It's not a problem, but just odd. Nicely shaped ergonomically and a good value with above caveats."
4,Keyboard Learning Curve,"The keyboard layout takes some getting used to, I would not recommend it for a ""hunt and peck"" typist. You have to have some typing skills to use it; however once you get used to it, I think its easier on the hands than a normal straight keyboard. The mouse is a good, easy to use, typical Microsoft issue. I use only wireless keyboards and mice- this one seems a little less succeptable to interference."
1,"after 5 months, the keyboard and mouse just stopped working","It was fine up until that point. I changed the batteries, reloaded the software, etc. It just didn't work anymore. The other thing i realized is that you have to have the wireless receiver, so your really are only reducing the numbers of wires that you have by 1 plus you clutter your desk with an additional piece of hardware, the wireless receiver.Not worth it at all."
3,Good keyboard but poor user interface design,"Good ergonomics, good finish and fair pricing. However, keyboard does not come with a LED telling user whether the keyboard is on! We wasted time trying to figure out why unit not working.First smart phone from Microsoft did not come with a lit keyboard either. Apple's G5 Powerbook has sensors that help the users find the keys in a dark airplane cabin! What a difference good design makes."
3,Good package deal with mouse & keyboard,"Pretty good products for the price. i had a problem with getting it installed at my home computer because the disc told me my drive wasn't big enough, which is bull, and i never did figure out why it wouldn't install on my computer, so i ended up having to use it at my work office. installed just fine there. the receiver has to be very close to both the mouse and the keyboard or it will go in and out of service. i also have a message that pops up occasionally that tells me the connection is weak, but it still works fine and the connection seems to be ok. besides that, the mouse is great because it's big and fits in the whole palm of your hand and is very smooth when scrolling and the keyboard types very smooth as well and is very quiet!"
1,POS,"I believe that a keyboard should work 100% of the time (I am understanding of battery replacement/lifetime) when used under reasonable conditions, but I am very disappointed in this system.I have some metal in my desk which seems to keep the mouse and keyboard from transmitting properly. I went through the process to determine the problem, but the only solution seems to be to keep the mouse within 6 inches of the receiver. I like the keyboard shape and feel, so I will be purchasing a non-wireless design. Knowing a little about transmitter/receiver design, this can be summed up as Microsoft cutting corners to save money by using a non-robust design. I have a 8 year old Logitech wireless system at home that still works flawlessly in all conditions. I figured that 8 years later a new system (Even from Microsoft) would be worry-free. Silly me. One more reason to dislike Microsoft."
2,"Disfunctional mouse, Keyboard fine","The wireless keyboard works fine, and shortcut keys for volume, calculator, etc are handy.Effective range from mouse to wireless puck is about 5 inches! Mouse goes through batteries incredibly fast. Went through countless alkaline AA's since I bought it a year ago (keyboard doesn't do this; still on original batteries). In contrast, previous Logitech wireless had great battery life and I never even thought about the range to the puck. This time I didn't buy a Logitech because couldn't find an ergonomic keyboard layout, but MS's mouse is so annoying that I'd never buy this again."
1,Bad Quality Product,"Me and two friends decided to buy this Keyboard+Mouse kit.The hardware was working relatively fine, but after exactly 1 month and 2 weeks of usage, the 3 keyboards starts presenting problems.Mostly with the specific keys.Hardware start presenting issues like one letter start to write on its own, and wont stop until you unplug the keyboard, or one key not writing the right letter, or F-keys not working, etc.Our thought is that all 3 units were defective, which is VERY BAD HARDWARE QUALITY we think.Right now, we are not eligible to do a good refund, and we mostly feel we have lost our money buying this piece of useless hardware.To be honest I DO NOT recommend buying this hardware or any Microsoft Hardware, which I have suffer a couple of issues in the past.To be honest I thought about giving Microsoft a second chance on this keyboard, but as expected, got wrong again.I will buy a logitech keyboard instead."
3,"Great Combo, But Gets Interference","I have used this keyboard/mouse combo for about 6 months now. I run a small business in web design and media development, so I use it everyday for about 10 hours. It's a great design works well, the mouse, although slightly heavy, is accurate.It got 3 starts from me because the range of the board and mouse varies. Basic things like a cordless phone and a portable hard drive interfere with the signal, causing a jerky motion in the mouse and missed letter in the keyboard. I have the wireless signal device VERY close to the keyboard (2 feet away), so it's not a matter of distance. I have tested this up to about 10 feet away. It sight, it works fine.So if you don't have many items on your desk that may interfere with the signal, you will enjoy this keyboard a lot."
5,Great Keyboard & Mouse,Very quick shipping. I got exactly the product I ordered. Everything was great with my order.
1,stopped working after 5 months,title says it all keyboard suddenly started stuttering one day and completely stopped the next. Microsoft was ok about honoring the 3 year guarantee.
5,"A very nice keyboard, but F-LOCK is dreadfull",I like my new keyboard. My hands don't suffer any more. Besides SPACE key works perfect. But... the only thing that bothers me is F-LOCK key. Every time I boot my pc I have to press it to activate standard functions binding.
2,Average quality.,"The keyboard layout is great and the mouse has some good options. The keyboard has TERRIBLE range and is interfered easily by wireless devices near it (e.g. cellphones, blue tooth devices, etc.). This keyboard and mouse is also greatly affected by other wireless keyboards and mice. My brother uses a Logitech keyboard/mouse combo and the Microsoft's keyboard/mouse are almost useless when the Logitech keyboard/mouse are used at the same time. If you plan on using wireless devices near this product I would not recommend it. Buy Logitech."
2,Still gets lost sometimes,"Maybe its my office, but the wireless stuff seems to ""Hick-up"" a lot in my office. Sometimes clicks and keystrokes get lost. Sliding the keyboard arround or moving the mouse and trying again normally solves the problem, but it is a pain. I know I have a LOT of wireless stuff in my office, so there is a lot of interference, but I am contemplating going back to wired."
3,Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro,Purchased this keyboard but never could get use to the ergonomic design.....sold it on eBay to someone that was looking for this very keyboard. They loved it and were happy to win the bid.
1,Reworked,I just recieved this keyboard and was expecting a new device. The box was not the manafacturers box and it had a label on it that said reworked. Did I miss something. I did not see anything on the web page that said this was not a new product. Buyer beware!
1,Function Keys Don't Work,"This keyboard tries to give new ""enhanced"" functionality to the function keys (F1, F2... F10 etc.) As a result F2 has become ""Undo"". F4 has become the ""New"" command. If you are used to the old functionality -- using F2 to mean ""Edit"", Alt-F4 to close a window -- they will no longer work. The function keys have been effectively hijaaked and there's no permanent way to put them back.There is an F Lock key that toggles back and forth between the old normal behavior and the new ""enhanced"" behavior. Unfortunately if you like the old behavior, you must push this F Lock key every time you restart your computer. If you search on Google for ""F Lock"" you'll encounter a slew of people complaining about this and the fact that there's no way to fix it.If you like the way your keyboard keys used to work, buy a Logitech."
4,Good Buy,"Works well in my home office. Sometimes a key will stick and you will get something like ""theeeeeeeee"" That is easy to fix with a backspace though. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to go wireless with the keyboard and mouse. Its great."
5,Great support for MacOS X,"This set works as well on MacOSX as it did under Windows XP. The drivers allow swapping of Ctrl & Command buttons, so anyone spending a lot of time using both operating systems can rest assured that Ctrl + C will always be the shortcut for ""Copy"".The media control buttons along the top control iTunes well, and offer track skipping, which is something the apple keyboard does not."
1,As many bugs as new 'useful' keys,"I'm on my second try of this product. Amazon's great customer services change the other because 5 or 6 keys was wrong, my numerical pad doen't works, when I press 7 1 6 9 or 3, the keyboards sends tons of diferent orders, even to send my computer to stanBy.The second keyboard was best, but it still have to many bugs, my left hand CTRL, SHIFT, and ALT keys doesn't respond sometimes, and others respond but doesn't hold the signal to make multiple selections.Final words... Try later when the bugs are corrected. now try another manufacturer"
2,"Great keyboard, the mice are GARBAGE.","I am on my second set, The click wheel doesn't work well at all. I have worked over the issue with MS with the first mouse and they had me return it for a new one. The second one is just as bad. If you are buying this just consider the paper weight a free bonus and look forward to a great keyboard."
1,Does not work as advertised,The Intellipoint and Intellitype 5.0 software that comes with this set does not function as promised. The SW crashes constantly and more than half of the programmable functions won't program. This is a return item for me.
1,Software crashes and unresponsive keyboard/mouse,"Just got this combo as a present yesterday, and already encountered a slew of problems.IntelliPoint and IntelliType Pro software constantly crash. Keyboard is often unresponsive, along with the mouse. This set is a dog. I have a regular Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro and MS Optical mouse, and love the split keyboard, but this wireless set is going back to Amazon, and I am getting Logitech."
3,"F1 key sticks, but I'm buying the same one to replace it.","I am a Software engineer. Had the keyboard less than a year. The F1 key sticks, tried using intellitype then more advanced techniques (regedit to disable the help function to no avail, having trouble locating the scancodes for the board). I have the same keyboard at home and my last job it works great there. battery life in the mouse is passable, about 6 months with 8hr/day usage. FLock is a stupid idea, only use the flock key to allow my print screen to work.... maybe a physical switch instead of the button would make more sense.I am requesting the same model to replace this one."
5,MS Wireless Optical Desktop Pro,Both the keyboard and mouse perform excellently. The hot key buttons on the keyboard provide an extra bonus and the back page button on the mouse is extremely useful.
1,Couldn't make it work,"Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop ProMouse was very comfortable and worked well. The ergonomic keboard was very comfortable with good action, fairly quiet, but didn't work well. Various keys, especially when used as a combo with upper case or Ctrl, would work sporadically. If I wasn't watching the screen, I'd type a word only to find that three or four of the characters didn't register. If I pressed one of the missing-character keys again and again (and again) it might work or it might not. Very frustrating. I returned it.The ""quick start"" folding card that came with the set referred to a user's manual, but there was none included."
2,Keyboard has Splotchy finish and not durable,"This is my first Amazon review of any type. I was quite happy to finally get a wireless keyboard and mouse. When this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy. It looks like someone painted the keys in a garage. I expected better. Now I have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment, and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken. I am not hard on the equipment and don't know how it happened.Once in a while I press keys and nothing happens. I can live with that.On the other hand, the mouse works as expected.Before you purchase one, check the process for returning it! I would rather put up with the crappy keyboard.....I will continue to purchase many books from Amazon but my computer hardware will come from Dell."
1,disappointing...,"I got this set from my wife as a present, and it replaced an old MS Natural Elite (one of two) that I had been using for a few years.Initially it seemed to work great but then I started to have problems with the mouse's left button. It started to require a hard push rather than a touch to activate, finally stopped working all together (the button).Then the keyboard started to activate the find function in Firefox and inputted random letters WITHOUT my input :( This was a major annoyance when doing work or when typing!I sent it to my local computer shop to have service, and they reported that the printed circuit was not repairable. So I tossed it, and pulled the old Elite back out of storage and my old wireless Logitech mouse, and for the last 6 months have not had any such problems with them.Needless to say I am very disappointed with the quality. However, that did not stop me from being getting another keyboard recently...a MS 4000, wired keyboard."
2,"I don't know why the home,end,delete keys were rearranged.","I like the keyboard a lot, unfortunately I keep hitting the delete key a lot, Microsoft Engeneers decided that the old arrangement does not make sense anymore and changed the location of the keys. VERY SMART FROM THEIR PART. Also I don't like the fact that it does not have a Windows Key at the right side.I'm a keyboard freek so I type a lot, having keys moved around does not help when you've been typing for a long time. If you don't use the keyboard much and use the mouse a lot, then this might be the keyboard for you."
2,Very Disappointed,Never received the CD. Had to DISPUTE the charge on my M/C even though the 'seller' claimed he'd submit a credit. Very disappointed.
3,Also disappointed,"Let me add my voice to those who are disappointed with the pieces. Ms. Alain is, as has been pointed out before, technically brilliant, but the feeling I got was ""let's get this over with"", not ""I can't wait to play this!"". There are a couple of what I call ""mad scientist"" pieces that are good introductions to those new to organ music, and this CD is great for that purpose. But the Bach and the Widor are way too rushed; these fantastic pieces are much to...well...fantastic, to be rushed. Every hemisemidemiquaver, every pedal tone, every flourish needs to be played, with the reverence that you give music of this stature. Here, while Ms. Alain obviously knows the music, she doesn't convince that she loves it. Three stars is sufficient, sadly..."
2,Heavier than what sounds good,"Don't get me wrong, I play Death Metal, and I live for things that are heavy, but not when it costs me the sound. The top strings are so heavy that the produce a horrid rattling sound, which becomes even louder should the string go slightly out of tune. They didn't even fit in my B.C. Rich properly, wasting the entire pack, but when I put them in my Epiphone SG, they made it difficult to play, especially sweep picking.If you just want garbage with Zakk Wylde's name on it, pick an issue of that horrible Metal Hammer magazine instead, and avoid these poorly designed strings."
5,Sunglass Readers,"These sunglass readers are ""stylish"", comfortable and very well made. They're a life saver if you're outdoors and reading something--like at the park/beach. I actually use them inside as well--I have them on top of my head, so they're handy."
4,Nice riding bifocals.,"Safety glasses that work well on a bike or motorcycle. Clear optics, good reading lens, nice price. Translucent frame is a little distracting."
5,Great reader sunglasses for motorcycle riding,"My husband purchased these sunglasses for himself. Once I began to lose my reading vision and could no longer read the odometer/speedometer or my xm radio station indicator, I borrowed them and haven't returned them yet. Also began using as my sunglasses everyday. Now I can read my text messages without taking off my regular sunglasses and replacing with readers while driving. They are wonderful at the beach! I am on Amazon today to purchase my pair so my husband can have his back."
5,Chilling,"Yecke is more right than anyone knows, or wants to admit, take it from someone who was on the inside. There is a concerted effort, nationwide, to dumb-down American children by turning education into indoctrination. It's a tacit understanding, spoken only in code, amidst the educators of the educators and the petty feifdoms we call our ""Boards of Education"". And her research methodologies could have been flawless and they'd have still gone after her with tooth & claw. Like I always say, as you look into matters such as these, ""follow the money"" -- you'd be horrified by how eager certain groups in this country are to sell your children, and their education, down the river in the name of their personal agendas and political movements. After 40+ years of following their agenda and methodology in running of our public schools, I think it's time we changed and took them back."
1,My review ignored?,"Yecke ignored all educational research to come to her bizzare conclusions about teaching, learning, and school in America. This book is about political and social agendas and has nothing to do with what is best practice in education or what is best for our students."
3,Spicy,"I received this seasoning but didn't know it had chilli pepper as one of the main ingredient. Spicy! Definately don't need any additional seasonings except for the perishable ones like, tomatoes, onions, etc."
1,Not the original recordings,I bought this disc just for Paper Tiger track. To my horror I found out that Sue went back in the studio sometime in the 70's and re-recorded the songs on this release. Don't buy this. It's a big waste of time !!
2,Soundgarden isn't complimented enough,"I purchased this thinking it would be great! I have Metallica's S & M and was hoping for something as good. Not in this case. Not at all. Some of the songs I couldn't even recognize I'm sorry to say. I love Soundgarden! I love them, so any version (even Pat Boone) I would enjoy. This was a disapointment."
5,A tribute to a Legend,"Chris Cornell has been a powerful force in the music industry since 1987 when his first single with Soundgarden was released. He helped shape two genres of music, he is a legend. And my favorite singer of all time. This is a collection of orchestral (strings) arrangements of some of his greatest gits ranging from the bands he has played with to his solo career. This is a great compilation, I love it!"
3,First Digital Frame I've Tried....,"I'm sure there are better digital frames out there. I cropped and resized many photos to fit the size of the frame (320x234) and they display ok, but I really do not like the slideshow. It plays much too quickly, and the transitions are annoying. The speed of the slideshow is not adjustable. The frame has a ""menu"", but there is no explaination in the manual as to the function of the 4 adjustable menu items. Smartparts tech support told me that the items in the menu ""generally do not need to be adjusted.""On the plus side, I only paid $70 for this frame, and when I wrote to tech support for help, and they replied within 24 hours, on thanksgiving weekend.This model works as described, but next time I'll buy one with a remote control, and with a customizable slide show."
1,"Low resolution, poor performance and poor documentation","Don't look too close to the screen, if you've got 20-20 vision you'll see the pixels. The slide show wouldn't play all the photos I loaded onto a SD card (I checked, they were all there and recognized by my computer's card reader.) Adjusting brightness using the ""menu"" function yielded no discernable results. Manual is poorly written. Web site for support even worse. You can get 799 15-cent prints at Wal*Mart and send them to grandma for the price of this piece of junk."
5,Daniel Pipes must have read Abu-Rabi's book with closed eyes,"This book is a great scholarly enterprise. For sure, Pipes' criticism of this book is an obvious prejudice. This is an intellectually thought provoking book."
3,Deep Trouble 2,"This is my favorite book,It's about Billy and Sheena spending another summer with their uncle Dr.Deep.When they are swimming,they are starting to notice that the sea creatures are growing bigger,bigger,and bigger.If you don't have this book, it's good to have a try."
5,Sparrow Hawk Red,This book has a Califonia young readers award.It is about a boy who lives in arizona his dad is an ex-DEA agent he quit because his wife was killed in a car accident. The car was suppose to killthe father because he made a drug arrest against a drug runner. Now a hightec radar system has been stolen the father has been offered the job of getting it back but turned them down. The twist is that his son learned about this and decides to steal the plane he might even make a couple of friends in this exciting adventure.
4,a really nice one,this is a really nice book and if u are at the store just bye it please .. it is very nice......
1,NOT A GOOD BOOK!,"Anyone who hasn't read this book yet don't it's NOT A GOOD BOOK! Deep Touble the 1st one is better where 4 kidnappers and Alex try to drown Dr. Deep, Billy, and Sheene read Deep Trouble!"
4,Deep Trouble II,Billy Deep and his sister Sheena are spending another summer in the Caribbean on their uncle's totally cool floating lab. The weather is beautiful. And there are lots of neat places to go swimming and snorkeling.Billy and Sheena are great swimmers. But even great swimmers get into trouble--especially this year. This year there's something really scary going on under the sea. The fish all seem to be growning. Bigger and Bigger. Into monter-sized sea creatures. With monster-sized appetities..WATCH OUT!
4,Giant fish,"A year has passed and Billy and Sheena are back to visit their uncle on his boat. Billy is hunted by a giant fish when out snorkelling. The giant fish turns out to be a minnow, a fish normally no bigger than 30 cm. What is happening to the ocean life? Why and how have they grown so large?Another nice story about Billy and his maritime adventures. The goldfish/snail scene was sad, though. It would've been nice if Stine had touched upon their fates."
5,The world's most amazing city,"This is a good, comprehensive history of New York City in an easy-reading 260 page book. Although New York City is the most exciting city in the world, its history, if not written well, could be boring to many people. But Lankevich succeeded. This book is not boring, but rather held my interest until the end. Of course, many events are not addressed in the book or are barely touched upon because of its length, but Lankevich provides a good history for those that are not ready to tackle ""Gotham,"" or some of the other massive histories of NYC that are out there.The one comment I have, though, is that I thought Lankevich spent too much time discussing the ""high history"" of NYC mayors and politics. I would've enjoyed a more social history of NYC. But overall, this is a well-written, good book. Check it out and learn more today about the world's most amazing city today."
1,Didn't finish it,"I really wanted to love this movie since I'm fascinated with trailers and atypical lifestyles. But it seems like the producers wanted to take the easy way out by just interviewing RVers in Walmart parking lots and not really seeking out any variety. Not only did that make the movie stale, but I don't think it was fair to the subjects. Surely the filmmakers could have visited some campgrounds, national parks, or other areas where retirees and RVers stay. It would have made for a more interesting movie and a more honest and well-rounded portrayal of these travelers."
5,Great product.,This material is easy to work with. Great prices. Easier than other types I have used in the past. May take two layers in some applications but they do also make a heavier version. Easy to cut and shape and sticks very well. Follow the instructions because if you try to use too large of pieces it will get ugly because it will stick to what ever it can. Definitely recommend.
4,Good book,"Has many breeds not covered in other books, still left some out but good variety. Nice color pictures of the breeds, I am currently working in a salon where the girls don't know many of the breeds by sight, this book has really helped them."
3,a good general book but lacking details,"This book is a good general reference to various dog breeds and typical grooming styles. Where the book falls down is that each breed, other than a few common breeds, is given very little details. For example, the Chinese Crested, which I was interested in, had no pictures to show the grooming, just a small paragraph. As well, no alternative cuts are suggested for some of the breeds that have several cutting styles, only the standard cuts are given."
3,More like grooming the ultimate show dog,"This book is not a complete guide to 170 dog breeds.This book does an OK job of covering the health aspects of grooming. I wouldn't say that it does a better of job of any of your standard ""All about dogs"" book.This book is more of a guide on how to groom a dog for show. If your dog is of a breed where the dog is groomed similarly for show as it would be groomed as a pet, this is a great book. If your dog is of a breed where a show worthy grooming is the complete opposite of a functional pet grooming, like maltese, yorkie, or any of the long haired breeds, this book will be useless. Unless you love looking at cute adorable doggies."
4,Great for would be groomers,"I found this book to be full of helpful information with clear instructions and explanations. The pictures are excellent. After reading this anyone would feel comfortable approaching any type of coat. It would be perfect to have in front of you in the salon and it lists every item needed for each design. It goes into great detail of the more tricky styles, as well as combatting any problems. All the info is here. Well worth the purchase.I see myself keeping this one for many, many years to come."
1,Not for beginners,I am trying to start groomming my two Pomeranians to save money but this book is not what I needed. It covers too many breeds and offers few specifics per breed. I also bought the Grooming for Dummies book and that is more what I needed.
3,"pets, not show -- not enough details","This is a very good book for the pet groomer. More thorough than other books I have seen that are directed at the pet groomer. However, there is little detailed information on grooming for show. There is specific information on grooming each breed, but this information, too, is not nearly detailed enough for show. If, however, you are grooming a pet, this book is recommended."
4,Great learning aid,I got this when I was first learning how to groom. I found it very helpful. The colored pictures really help. It is also very detailed. It's a solid 4.5 stars!
2,"Works okay, but could use an adjustable neck","I've been using this lamp for about a month now. It works fine as a bedside lamp, but I would have been happier if its neck was adjustable. (My bad: I had presumed it was when I bought it). Also the light bulb is a non-standard one - I hope I'll find a replacement at the local drugstore when it goes bad. Finally, the head itself is adjustable, but it's been giving me trouble - it doesn't stay in the position I set it, but slowly slides down to the lowest position. I'm not sending the lamp back because it was cheap and not worth the trouble. But I've learned my lesson - never buy a lamp at an online store unless you've tried it out at a store."
5,Stunningly beautiful,"This is the most beautiful collection of spirituals I have ever heard. The album was created in honor of Black History Month by Radio Bible Class ministries and Discovery House Music. The Gershwin-style arrangements and orchestration are haunting and rich. The songs, sung by various artists, draw you into a painful period of American history, out of which came the passionate and heartfelt cries of enslaved human beings. The liner notes include stories about several individuals, many of whom are not generally the focus of Black History Month, though they should be. From Wintley Phipps and Larnelle Harris to Billy Davis, Jr. (""Wade in the Water""), Marilyn McCoo (""Motherless Child""), and Debbie McClendon Smith (""Steal Away""), this CD is MUST for anyone who not only loves great music but cherishes the heritage of the American spiritual. These are songs of the heart......and soul."
2,Not good.,"I've bought a few of these as I prefer the analog readout as opposed to digital. The reason I've had to buy more than one is that the belt clip is poorly designed and breaks consistently after wearing the pedometer for a few weeks or so. Fixing it with super glue is a temporary fix since the clip invariably breaks at a different location. After some months of use, the small hand counting the steps in thousands loses accuracy.I contacted Accusplit's customer service and asked for replacement clips. Didn't get a response the first time but heard back from them after my second email. Their representative said he would send new clips but never did. Poor customer service on top of a poor product. Don't waste your money."
3,"So, so - a step counter not a pedometer","It works OK but it does not measure kilometers or miles - it counts steps. The advertising is not accurate. So you have to figure out home many inches in your step, then figure steps to a mile. 10,000 steps is around 5 miles but if you want to be accurate, you need to establish your average pace or step."
1,Boring and Unsexy,Someone is killing off the girls who take it off live on webcam for a sexual fantasy site.Who knew that you a movie about sex workers could be this boring? And unsexy!Things aren't helped by bargain basement sets and continuity errors that are more entertaining than the movie itself.The LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK-worthy title doesn't help things much either.Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog
1,Fail,"The filmmakers fail on all counts! Bad acting, camera work, editing, sound, story... there is nothing acceptable about this film. I have been watching a lot of independent films lately but this is the worst I have seen. Kitty Duncan isn't really an actress, she is a porno girl and her acting here shows that she belongs in that industry and not horror movies. I saw her under a different name doing fetish porn, I believe Izzy Sinclair was the alias. Actually most of these actors are in porn now or used to be. However, they forgot to take their clothes off in this disaster."
5,"Small, but mighty","This was an extremely ""easy-read"" book, which made a lot of common sense. I had purposefully stayed away from the futures markets due to the fact that I do not have much risk capital. This book motivates me to attempt the writing of my own trading systems. I may ""paper trade"" them only, but after reading this book, I feel this is exactly what I should do before I take the giant leap into the futures markets. It has been a long time in between books which motivate me, and I just want to say that if you have any interest in developing your own trading systems, you too, may be inspired by this little book."
2,how to write fiction that sells!,"The title of this book should be like the one in the heading of this article instead of what it prints! Ben Bova is a good writer but did not show you how to write good SF in this book. If you really want to write SF, go Orson Scott Card's ""how to write science fiction and fantasy"""
4,Good advice on the craft of writing,"Though I admit I'm not so keen on Bova's writing style in itself, he offers good advice on the actual mechanics of building a story: character, plot, conflict, etc. He rightfully recognizes that most budding writers have the talent but are rejected because of poor *craft*, which he says can be taught. The book goes a long way in doing so."
3,Improve your observation,"I was looking for a book on how to improve my observation ability and stumble upon this book. This is a quite short book only including 78 pages. I was hoping for more information on how to improve my observation because of the title. Overall I found this book pretty interesting with some observation tips that could be applied in all kinds of different situations, for example at the poker table ;-)"
5,Fantastic,Beautiful pictures and narratives about 18th century Whaling. For all ages. The art work is worth an extra mention. This is the kind of book you pick up and read and look at it in bits and pieces.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this product and have tried it on 3 computers. On 2 of them, the keyboard wouldn't work at all. I wasted hours with Microsoft tech ""support.""I just wish I hadn't bought the darned thing in the first place."
3,ok keyboard,"It doesn't always function (green ""on"" light) when I turn my computer on. I usually have to restart it once or sometimes twice. Never had that problem with old keyboard. It's compatible with my system so I don't understand what the problem is. But otherwise the keyboard itself is comfortable."
4,Nice keyboard,"I have carpal tunnel very bad so I thought I would give this keyboard a try. It does take some getting used to but, I can type for hours and my hands dont hurt at all. The only thing is with mine for some reason sometimes it opens up my music folder and I am not pressing that button, just trying to type. I am sure I could return it, but don't want the hassle. Overall I think its a great keyboard for the price."
3,keyboard,"Have had several of these. Last one was left at job when I relocated, the first one had missing key, second was good. this one- ""caps lock"" light does not come on. The next will be a different brand."
4,A great keyboard,"This is a great keyboard, it may have some disadvantages but none that I have discovered as yet. I bought another for our 2nd desktop, if your wrists are aching....give this one a try."
5,"Best Keyboard I've Ever Owned, but really, that didn't take much","I'm tempted to buy another of these for work. It's a solid good keyboard with great action on the keys. I'm not so concerned about the multimedia buttons, etc, though I do use F keys frequently as I'm an old ""commander"" style file navigator person. I didn't do the hack so the F lock was always on. Maybe I'm just aware enough that I can tell if the F lock is on or not before I go hitting a button right next to it. I'm also thinking the F lock might stay on when it comes back from hibernation mode. The insert key being in a different place doesn't bother me either, and I use it regularly with the informenter firefox plugin.Pros: Good feel and great action on the keys. Looks spiffy.Cons: I guess the F key thing, but it's no big deal to me. And I guess since I'm nitpicking, maybe just lose the goofy multimedia keys too.I need to buy another of these before they go away or the price increases from $20 and free ship like Amazon has now."
5,great keyboard,"Even though this keyboard is under $20, microsoft keyboards are always great keyboards. The keys are quiet to the touch and it has a very comfortable lay out."
2,"Very nice keyboard, but one major Microsoft flaw!!","I've had this keyboard for a couple of years now, and I really like it except for one MAJOR flaw. The keyboard legs keep breaking and falling off!! I've called Microsoft to reorder them, and they don't even sell a replacement for the keyboard legs, not for this or any of their other keyboards!! So if one of your two keyboard legs breaks (they usually break one at a time), make sure you have super glue handy. I've glued my left one 4 times already at 4 difft places!! That's how cheap these keyboard legs are made. Shame on Microsoft. They want us to buy a brand new keyboard when a keyboard leg breaks!! Microsoft! Please make and at least sell us some replacement keyboard legs, or make your cheap keyboard legs better!!!"
2,Not a USB keyboard,"If all you need is PS/2 this keyboard is possibly a good deal. It doesn't have a USB adapter, it is PS/2 only. I'm suprised to see these are still being sold. Some of the latest PC's, maybe most of them, are dropping the PS/2 legacy connector so check the back of your box before ordering this.Besides that, the key action is kinda stiff. I'm picky. It's better than a normal keyboard, but there are better ergo keyboards than this one."
3,Everything is great except the clickety-clack of the keys,"Ergonomic shape takes getting use to for sure, but after the transition you might find yourself only wanting to use this type. I still have problems however having to look at the keys when I type because I use a laptop standard flat keyboard in-between this one, and I often have trouble finding the keys without looking.The keys are loud which I hate. I will replace this with a quiet keyboard when I have a chance."
3,Nice if you like the wavy style keyboard,"Nice, solid keyboard if you like the wavy style. I couldn't get comfortable so I stuck it in a cabinet."
2,"Rearranged cursor control keys and ""F Lock"" are an annoyance","This keyboard has a comfortable feel, but I prefer my 7-year-old original Microsoft Natural keyboard, as Microsoft has really fouled up the layout of this one.The ""home"" and ""end"" keys have been moved, the ""delete"" key enlarged to twice its original size, and the ""insert"" key is entirely missing. What's more, the F keys have been replaced by Microsoft Office control keys (open, save, undo, print, etc.), and if you want them to act how they're supposed to, you have to manually turn on ""F Lock"" each and every time you boot--this key cannot be controlled by software! (There is a registry hack for Win2k/XP that can effectively disable ""F lock"" on the PS/2 version, but if you're using USB or another OS, then you're up a creek.)It's a shame Microsoft had to add these annoyances to an otherwise good keyboard."
2,This is PS/2 not USB,"This is PS/2 not USB, and I wish it said it clearly in the product description. keyboard is large, looks fine but I can't connect it!"
4,great as long as you do not need a usb keyboard,"Works great on older computers, most new Dell's come with a usb port only, tried an adapter, could not get it to work."
5,Great keyboard,"This is a great keyboard though it may take a little getting used to.As a software developer I use my keyboard frequently, my wrists do not bother me since I got this gift.Thank you Microsoft."
2,Microsoft Natural Multimedia Keyboard,"Its Ok, but the keys are loud and I find it to be some what uncomfortable. When I ordered it I was looking for this type of keyboard but am disappointed. It isn't raised enough and the placement of the keys is too slanted side ways to be comfortable."
5,A mystical night,"I just finished the book and I strongly recommend it. Although very hard to read and full of historical references, the plot is very thick and keeps your attention high throughout the journey. If you liked the Decameron you'll love this book, if you like historical fiction this is the book for you, if you want to know more about Sicily's history don't hesitate to pick the book in your hands. Best to read with a glass of Brandy on a coffee table, out on a porch overlooking the ocean, during a warm starry summer night. E-mail me for suggestion on similar books. Enjoy it Simone"
5,Superb writing,A brilliant writer at the top of his form. One of my favorite books that has inspired me in my own writing. Highly recommended.
5,My favorite creamer,I use only 1/2 tablespoon per 8 oz cup and find that is sweetens and softens my coffee perfectly. I enjoy trying the new flavors but haven't found any that people like so consistently has hazelnut.
5,Great product for its price range,"If you're looking for a not so pricy, but still good system for TV, Games and music, it's a great set of speakers."
4,Best lock i use,This item I bought a couple of weeks ago. its awsome. I told my parents that I wanted to get a bmx bike for school. they told me that I had to also get a lock for it because they were not going to give extra money to buy another one if it go stolen. I like this cause it has a combo so I do not loose a key while at school. I my mom set it to the last 4 numbers of our phone so I would always remember it. This lock has also helped me to lock up my best friends bike. his is old but its a cool color so he rides it. the package said kryptonite so superman cant get my bike.
5,Beautiful.,"I started collected Icart sketches a few years ago. This book is FABULOUS. It breaks down his work by periods. The pages are full of his sketches / year created / little tid bits regarding them. The reproduced works are full color (though I love love love the black and white sketches) and just beautiful. At the end of the book is a short glimpse of other artists whose work was during the same time, making comparison easy.If you like Icart -- this book is a HAVE TO HAVE!"
5,Great!!! while they lasted.,These strings are great for chugging. and tearing it up. sound AMAZING for about 3 weeks to a month. i changed em before the high e broke because of the sound quality. 5 stars because of the price. id easily buy more of these. good thing i ordered 3 packs XD great strings i reccomend them.
3,"Eh, IDK whats with these...","I ordered because of the great reviews, but the strings started breaking about 1-2 weeks later. I normally don't change my strings that often but still, I don't think I'd get these again."
4,Regular,"Usually Ernie Ball is the authority in guitar strings, but these are not as good as others, when I was tuning, the thinnest string broke down and I had to improvise. they sound and feel great."
4,They are good!,"They sound like any other good guitar strings. One thing that I saw was different from other strings was how thinner the strings G,B,E were. Idk if thats good or bad to you I was just like Ooh thats different! W/E (Keeps Playing)"
5,Dead Reckoning-Marit Peters,"This is one of the best albums I've purchase recently. Full of powerful moving lyrics. Everyone I have recommended it to loves it. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Marit's Excellent CD,"My Spanish teacher is by far a FANTASTIC singer!!!! In this CD she portrays thoughtful lyrics and a beautiful voice. You can totally tell she is a nice person---and a great singer! I liked this CD because I thought it was totally cool that my teacher could sing! Plus, I loved everything about it from the lyrics to the instruments in the background. I would whole-heartedly reccomend this CD to ANYONE!!!!"
1,Some really great information here!,I especially enjoyed the section on how to cheat on your wife (and get away with it)! My wife loved it too!I will proudly give this book to my son who's graduating highschool in hopes of imparting some really deep wisdom.I wonder how many Daniel Klines and Jason Tomaszewskis it takes to change a light bulb.A must for any guy with aspirations of becoming a slackin' FOOL!I think $10.78 worth of toilet paper would have been abetter investment!
2,Firm means firm!,Order them larger than you need they run small! I couldn't wear them so I gave them to someone smaller than me.
3,Not enough battle groups.,"Close Combat Battle of the Bulge is a good game compared to Close Combat 1,2 or 3 but it still needs improvements like more battle groups in the battle maker. Although there are a lot of maps to fight on they get to all look the same after while with all that snow. There are just not enough types of infantry or tank units to keep your attention for very long. But I suppose I might be asking too much from a $20 game. I say if you're looking for a small-scale strategy game, go with Close Combat 5."
3,disappointed,"As a Close Combat fan, especially CC3, I was excited to get a copy of CC4-Battle of the Bulge. As others have said, it is nowhere near the level of CC3. You cannot select individual units, the AI is seriously flawed, and the same maps get used over and over-even if you ""hold"" an area after one battle...the computer will take it away from you the next time. Also, I have yet to see a Tiger or King Tiger tank. Why does the book even mention them? The game requires incredible patience as well; to complete the campaign takes days. I hardly ever play it anymore, and have reverted to CC3 for my wargaming."
4,Another excellent game in the Close Combat series,"This real-time strategy game is the best I have played from this genre. I have played all of the games in the Close Combat series, and many games of this type from other publishers. To date, I believe this is the best. If you have played any of the other Close Combat games, this one is pretty similar. One notable difference from the others is that attacks can come from any direction. Previous versions were far more predictable in that you always knew what direction the enemy would be comming from. In addition, this version takes into account morale and willingness to fight. Battles will cease if morale gets too low. One change that I did not like from the previous versions, is an inability to choose units to acquisition. A minor drawback for a game with many merits. Regardless of whether or not you have played other war strategy games, this one is an excellent choice."
2,Awful,This game was simply awful compared with CC I through III. I had a blast with CC III but I would not recommend this one at all.
4,Great fish for a fish lover!,"My son LOVES fish. I bought these because he asked for ""fish"" for Christmas. It's a great set with 5 of each kind of fish. The only thing that is missing are the actual names of the types of fish included. My son is very into that and we couldn't tell him what they were called. :o( Otherwise, it's a great set that he can cart around the house and take outside or into the bath!"
3,very small,"These are definitely for children who are beyond putting things in their mouth. They are really, really small. But great looking, good detail and certainly plenty of them."
3,Not really what I expected.....,"I purchased the learning resources fish and animals. The arrived in just a few days, I was so excited to see them and when I opened the box I was a little bit upset when I seen them! I guess I should have looked at the information on them a little better but these are very small! (can fit inside my 2 year olds hand completely! There are 6 of each animal I believe they do seem to be made very good so far and all of the animals actually stand up with out a problem which is a big thing for us here because my child does not like it when he can not get toys to stand. There is no nemo in the fish which I would have assumed there would have been but maybe that is just me. Also when we 1st opened them the had a VERY strong paint smell coming of from them. Over all the kids still enjoy them and I think they were a ok buy."
5,survial,i love this book i have read book one and two and the words are easy to understand. that i why i gave it five stars. by cody to miss gordon
4,youth book,"Very interesting personalities in this book. Gordon Korman is a good writer. I do prefer his humorous books, but these keep your attention also,"
4,"Great Album, Terrible Title","It's a great album, and the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the horrifying grammatical error in the title (look again) that I'm sure the band regrets constantly. The sound quality is not that wonderful, but there are some truly memorable tunes on it just the same. By all means, get this thing if you don't have it, but buy their self-titled debut album first. That, and check the alternative tentacles website before shelling out more than twelve bucks for this cd."
5,excelent,this boook is an exelent way to learn fhysics. therefore i recoment it to people who want to learn physics from the start of it. it has the ability to explain the way physics got where they are today. and it can also explain how the mathematic formulas can be explained with simply fhysics
1,Windows 2000 3 Pack,"I did not receive what was advertised. I ordered a 3 pack as advertised and received a single pack for the price of a 3 pack. When I contacted the seller, they played dumb like they didn't know the difference between a 3 pack and a single pack. So, I got taken."
1,socks way too tight..,"I tried these on right away, and I have to say they were way smaller than the large size they were marked as. I was not even able to get either one all the way on, even realizing they are supposed to be snug. Not recommended, unless you know to up-size them at least one or two sizes."
3,Mouse doesn't work on black surface.,Overall the product is fine though it is cheaply looked. Onecaution is that the mouse doesnot work on my black desk.
1,No range,"I couldn't get the keyboard on this thing to work reliably more than 3 feet away from the reciever. I changed batteries and tried changing the channels with no improvement. If the reciever is on the same horizontal level and the left side of the keyboard is pointed at it, the range goes up to about 6 feet reliably. At one point, I had the reciever sitting foot and a half directly below the keyboard and couldn't get <alt> key combos to work. Fresh batteries didn't help either. Maybe I just got a defective one, but it looks like I'm not the only one who's had this problem."
2,Microsoft Wireless Keyboard,"Works well at very short range. Otherwise, not so much... Receiver is as big as a hockey puck !!!"
1,Stops Working,"I had the same experience that someone else had. When I first bought this, it worked great, but after a while, the range got worse and worse. I finally moved the transmitter about a foot away from the keyboard and mouse and they wouldn't work. I changed the batteries and that did not help. I don't know if this eventually happens with all wireless keyboards, but I would not recommend buying this one."
5,Great for Beginners,"I'm not saying this is the best book out there for starting and running a coffee bar... but it's definitely recommended as a FIRST read on the subject. It offers elementary info on the topic, but this is a good thing 'cause you're going to need to know the basics."
2,Needs to go in depth and provide detailed real examples.,"This book is competently written and covers a lot of areas but fails to break the surface. Most of the information feels unimportant, most of it just comes down to common sense.About of a quarter of the way through I got tired of reading as it began to feel like a waste of time.The example that describes a day of a specific cafe gives no insight and basically comes down to, then we heat up coffee, then we heat up some cakes, blah blah."
2,Em. . .,"A decent overview of the historical reference points that Lucas & Co. drew on as the basis of their Jedi Knights. There is also some educated discussion concerning technique and modus operandi of swordsmen throughout history.However, the writing is often difficult to follow, and many passages are confusingly constructed. The book is poorly edited (if it was edited at all), which makes for a good many distractions, as one tries to figure out what the author is trying to say.Kind of frightening that the author teaches grade school.Worth a read, if you are a great fan of the Star Wars films, or want a brief history of swordsmanship but be prepared to stumble through the tangled mess of a poorly written essay."
5,deathly beautiful,"I have the book the dark tower by josepgh vargo and the pictures all over my room! I recently bought this cd and have re-read the book as it follows on cd through the books stories and OMG its so enchanting i read it w/soundtrack twice in one night now i read it 3 times a week and contionously leave it on repeat as i dream!! So yeah check out art work and awesome gothic books etc, by joseph vargo!!! go to monolithgraphics.com You wont be dissapointed!!!"
2,Another disc of cut and paste samples,"Time to see the truth about this band, folks. Endless samples, cut and paste arrangements are about it. It's goth elevator music and good for that but not much else. After a good start total disapointment with this band has set in."
4,Gothic Mood Music,"This is a hauntingly good work of music for those who seek something dark and gothic. Born of the Night provides a musical tour of a dark and gloomy castle, filled with spirits,vampires, and other undead. This is a perfect cd for Halloween or for those who want to put on a cape and play Dracula. Check out Midnight Syndicate's newest cd Realm of Shadows, an even better gothic cd. The music will keep you up all night."
4,Medical Mystery,"If you like medical mysteries, then add this to your list. Here we have a husband named Plato who is a geriatrician and a wife named Cal who is a forensics pathologist. This time out the two are trying to find out how one of Plato's favorite patients ends up as a cadaver at the medical school. Lots of information on how medications are developed. Good read, however could of used better editing. (this if for the paperback edition)"
2,Double charged,"The item is great. My son loves it, but Amazon double charged me for item and refuses to take responsibility for it. I had to dispute the charge."
3,Ok for starters,"I cranked this to 5, and was able to squeeze it fairly rapidly over 30 times either hand. If you want to build up forearms, 5-25 reps to failure is recommended, I believe. Maybe this unit is for rehabilitation exercises?The plastic grips are textured, but once I had a little sweat on my palms, my fingers slipped and slid up and pressed into the body of the unit. Also note this is all plastic (except the springs :).The price was quite low, however.Note that I haven't been working on my grip, and am only up to about 35 lb dumbells for biceps. So I didn't think I'd overpower it as easily."
2,Tepid,"Yes--I am not surprised you are ambivalent about Rameau after this lukewarm and unmagical performance--By now I hope you have found pleasure through Christie--Gardener--Minkowski- who really know how to make Rameau shine--and who do NOT--as the otherwise admirable Leppard does here--reduce the tempo's to Handelian slowness. It IS lighter music--but for that has a savor of its own---Rameau is a master in his way as Handel in his.. Nice singing--but,again,too ponderous from the opening overture and throughout......"
2,Clack Clack Clack,"I purchased this item from a local retail store (the only brand they had on the shelf) and I was disappointed to find it makes an audible ""Clack Clack"" noise, due to plastic parts rattling around during operation. I used it for several months until it eventually got a short in the wire, just above the headphone jack, under minimal wear and tear.Obviously I don't recommend this item, and I would advise against getting most white electronics for your car because they turn noticeably yellow in the sun."
1,Poor Try!,"This does not seem to work with a good auto reverse deck, the deck keeps trying to REVERSE direction like it is supposed to do at the end of a tape.I'll stick to the CD player in the car."
2,"Good, ok, sad, worse.","Initially this thing sounded good and worked well, although the right channel was about 40% louder than the left. There is some noticable noise from the inner workings in between sound tracks. It's there all the time, but only really obvious when there is no music. Eventually the casette adapter started ejecting out of my deck, now it goes about 30 secs between every ejection. Oh, well. Maybe they'll send me a new one for free. More likely, I'll find something else."
1,Terrible.,"I've owned three of these now, and all of them develop the same issues. They start out working well with clear and accurate sound quality, but then quickly degrade into noisy messes with terrible interference. The two I had before lost one of the stereo channels so I could only hear the left channel. My current one is very noisy and picks up a lot of interference."
1,Bad Buy!,This Tape Adapter only lasted for a few months before it shredded itself inside my tape player. I bought this because I travel often and I thought it would be easier to get a tape player than an FM adapter so I wouldn't lose the signal but not I bought a Belkin FM adapter cause the tape sucks! Don't waste your money!
5,Just as promised,"I ordered this to play my Ipod in my car. It is great and easy to use. The only down side, there is a faint noise that comes from the tape player but you have to have the sound turned all the way down on the audio."
4,Works Like a Charm,"I bought a couple of those adapters that plug into your cigarette lighter and are supposed to play thru your radio and they never worked. I only ever got static. THIS though works like a charm.It's fantastic. Plug it in to your i Pod, pop it into your tape player and you have music! Excellent. If you don't have a tape player in your vehicle it would be worth it to buy an inexpensive one in order to have access to your i Pod music. That's my 2 cents."
1,Utterly Worthless ...,"When it worked it didn't work well, the rest of the time it didn't work at all. It's in the trash now where it belongs (I got a DLO, which works perfectly so far)."
1,Works OK but mechanical noises were too much to overcome,"Bought this to play tunes from my iPhone 3G in my car. Works as advertised and sound quality was OK, but the unit rattles and crackles in the tape player so much and so loudly that I just couldn't stand it. Very distracting - completely overshadowed the otherwise acceptable performance of the unit.I'm taking this thing back and looking for a more solidly built unit to do the job."
1,not a star product,"snapped it in the deck... sound out of only one channel... every other function (recorded cassette, am fm radio) works both channels... returned it... like neil young said, ""when i got it home it was a piece of crap""... and a flimsy piece of crap at that"
3,you get what you pay for,this is an inexpensive product that will get the job done if you're on a budget. the only problem i have with it is that it makes noise while in the tape player. this can get very annoying if you like listening to music at a low volume.
1,Very poor quality,People should not buy this product. Because quality of the product is very poor.You can get much more better quality product with less price from a different company
2,rattles/grinds,Poor quality construction. It made a lot of noise in the casette deck at first (grinding/spinning noise). I checked out the head and shook it around some and now it seems to work fine with just a little hiss.
2,Not that great,"The tape deck in my car would play the ipod for about 10 seconds and then it would reject the tape adapter thing. I wasn't very impressed by this performance. It is possible that I purchased one that happened to be flawed, because it appears that other reviewers have been able to use their adapaters for more than 10 seconds at a time."
2,Rattletrap,"I bought this item to hook up to my iPod while driving my Honda Pilot. The sound quality is reasonable especially considering the price - better than the FM transmitter I was using before - but the product is close to unusable because of the noticeable rattling from the adapter's wheels. Very disappointing. I've read similar reviews about the Monster: too much unwanted noise and rattling. I had a MacAlly adaptor about two years ago for use with my office cassette player, and it eventually started rattling and then the wire broke. I'm going to check out the Sony version which seems to get higher reviews."
1,Loud and obnoxious,"I don't know if it's common to all of these tape-type adapters, but the noise coming from the tape player is so loud you can hardly hear the music unless you're blasting it. We also get a strang buzzing once in a while as it plays. Don't bother with this. I've heard the FM adapters are no good in urban areas either, so I reccommend an adapter that hooks to your CD Changer input if that's an option for you."
2,terrible sound quality,Do not buy this adapter if you intend to use it with the iPod. The sound quality is very poor.
3,Worked on low density ipod only.,"I found this worked pretty good when I used a low density iPod like a shuffle the sound quality was pretty nice.However, when I tried to connect my iphone or an iPod classic the sound quality was scratchy and weak and not something I would listen to. I also found it to be sensitive and have the ipod connected before turning on the power to the tape player or else I'd get a loud popping sound from my speakers when I connected it up.I saw other ratings saying the unit worked great at first but didn't last long. As a result, I leave mine in the tape player all the time and treat it very gently. So far, it works fine as long as I treat it as I stated above."
2,Disappointing,"On the plus side:1. This cassette adapter works in my Passat's stereo, unlike the Sony adapter, which did not.2. Sound quality and usability are both better than the iTrip.One the minus side:1. The sound quality is miserable. Bass is almost totally missing. The midrange dominates, and most of the high end is muted. This problem is so bad that adjusting bass/midrange/treble on my stereo cannot compensate. For reference, actual cassettes sound great in this same stereo.2. This cassette adapter has gears in it that make both spindles turn when one is turning. This is probably what makes it work in my stereo, however it does make some sound. The end result is some mechanical noise that gets in the way of quiet parts of the music."
2,"They start fine, then degrade into noisy annoyances","I have gone through three of these; I purchased two and one I got as a warrantee replacement. Each failed the same way. They start out fine, then gradually start making more and more mechanical noise. Eventually the noise becomes so annoying that the unit needs to be replaced. I give it two stars only because it dies over time rather than all at once."
3,Good for Audiobooks,"I use this adapter to listen to AudioBooks in my 2001 Toyota Corolla (which has a factory-installed tape deck). It worked fine, although apparently some other Toyota owners have had some difficulties. I am glad I have this because otherwise I can't really use the radio transmitter adapter since the San Francisco area has too many radio stations.The sound quality is fine for audio books, though there is some clicking and whirring from the cassette player attempting to turn the wheels of this pseudo-cassette. I imagine that would get very annoying if you were listening to music.I do find that sometimes ejecting the adapter and then re-inserting changes the volume and/or sound quality. It seems to be sensitive to the way it is seated in the casette player."
1,I can't believe they tested this,"This is horrible. The first one I bought has a very loud whirring and clicking when connecting an iPod in a Honda CRV. It was impossible to listen to the music. I returned it and swapped it for another, and the performance was identical. For an iPod in my car it is completely unusable."
1,Piece of Crap,"Lasted me for two months, and then fell apart. The wire came lose very easily after only moderate use. There was so much clatter and noise when i hooked it up. Use to own a Sony one, which was cheaper and lasted me two years. This is a piece of crap, don't but it!"
5,Love Love Love this iPod Belkin Cassette Adapter,"I tried one of the FM receiver adapters to listen to my iPod in the car, but it was junk, especially compared to the cassette adapter...fortunately I have both cassette & cd capabilities in my vehicle...I recommend this to anyone who has a cassette player in their vehicle & wants the option of listening to their iPod through their vehicle's speakers!"
5,Nice to have,It's been great having this little gadget. I can now blast my iTouch in the car. Simple to use.
1,Didn't work for me,Bought this to add iPOD playbak to my 2003 Tahoe and it worked for a minute or two then the headunit ejected the adapter. Now I can't get it to stay in and play for more than a couple seconds. When it did play the sound was inferior to even a casette tape.
2,"Yeah, Too Loud",I'd agree with some of the earlier comments. I got this as part of an iPod package deal thing. I already had I believe a Memorex version of the adapter from way back in the day when I'd use my Discman in the car. I tried this new one just for the heck of it and the rattling was very distracting. Went back to the 15-year-old model I have and it works just great...
1,"I didn't trust the bad reviews, and payed the price.","Please believe the bad reviews. My wife and I bought this for a cross country road trip. We were wary because of the bad reviews, but figured that as long as it held up for the duration of the trip, we got our money's worth out of it. It did not. It starting switching sides within the first 5 or 6 hours, and now is totally defunct. Additionally, it screwed up the display in my car. Even after taking this worthless contraption out, my display bounces back and forth from TAPE to PLEASE INSERT TAPE in a glitchy way. I'm really mad at myself for not listening to all of the negative reviews. Do not buy this product. Did this company do no testing before they released it?"
5,Great product,"For costing as little as it does, this cassette adapter provides a simple connection and great sound transfer. It even gives you plenty of bass, which is usually the first thing to go when converting from an iPod to a car stereo unit."
2,"Belkin Cassette Adapter for Ipods, MP3 Players & CD",Sometime this works sometimes it doesn't! Time to buy a new one... TheBelkin F8V366 Mobile Cassette Adapter for MP3/CD/MD
3,Works in some cars,"This adapter works fine in a 1996 VW Jetta, but gives very low volume in a 2001 Toyota Avalon. My older RCA adapter worked in both cars, and looking at it, the head on that one is about 1mm higher than in the Belkin. I checked by switching the innards of the two, and the Belkin guts inside the RCA case works fine in both cars, so it's really all about the position of the head. I'd recommend instead getting a dual-position adapter or one that you can flip over (this one doesn't allow that)."
1,poor materials,"I bought this product less than 2 weeks ago and for those two weeks it worked great, sound quality was really good and there was no ""noise"" as other people have been saying. But then the other day it decided not to work. It began stopping 5 seconds into the songs and then ejecting. I tried rewinding it but it did not work. Then it just completely stopped working and my car would not even recognize it and a rattling noise can be heard inside the cassette which suggests that something broke inside it.For the two weeks I had it, it was great but it was, like other things I have bought on here, made of cheap material somewhere in China. I doubt I will buy anything else from here, I suggest shopping in person, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"
1,Didn't work,"I purchased one one of these units some time ago and it never worked right. It would work for a few seconds in my car stereo before being automatically ejected with an error indicating that the ""tape"" had become unwound."
5,Nice Product to Buy,Very easy to use. Compatible with almost all mp3 players/Ipod/Iphone. sounds great.I will recommend to buy this product. Worth it.
1,"It does work, but it's noisy noisy noisy!","This was a huge disappointment. It did work, but I had to crank the volume way up in order to hear anything, and there was this incredibly annoying loud clicking-clacking sound, nonstop."
1,rice crumbs,"This product was a true disappointment. When I opened the box, there was a slight odor to it. Amazon would not let me get a refund back, and instead sent a new box of rice crumbs. The new box of 8 packages expires in April 2011!.Not sure I will buy food again through Amazon unless it is returnable. Very, very dissatisfied."
4,Bright Signal Wand,Very bright and well construction signal wand. I was going to try to retrofit it to accommodate my needs but LED’s through-out wand length which did not work for my retrofit.
5,Thomas Easter Surprise,"Well, this was a great hit in my 4 year olds Easter basket. We have been collecting the Take Along Trains and this special set of four cars is really delightful. I hope that the Take Along company will make more special holiday trains and we will surely buy them."
5,A snowballing problem...,This is a wonderful story and both my 5yo and my 3yo love it (and I like reading it too). The King wants to get rid of the mice and his wise men keep coming up with progressivly worse solutions until the King is right back where he started -- and creative thinking saves the day! Great illustrations.
4,Good Book,This was one of my favorite books since I was a kid. The pictures were funny and the story has two good lessons in it. People should try to figure out your own problems and don't judge a book by its cover. In this case the mice. The king learned to share his home and his cheese and that's the moral of this story. I would recommended this book to my friends if they where doing this project. It is a great learning experience for kids.
5,Graphically Wonderful!,I remember this book from when I was a child about 30 years ago and what I most remember was how wonderful the expressions of the various animals had on their little faces. Absolutely wonderful art work that will make you feel part of the characters in the book. The moral of this story is great as well.....learn how to share!!! We need more sharing and caring and this book points it out very delicately and creatively!
5,Sometimes the cure is worse than the problem,My kids love this book. The pictures are great and the plot is simple.For me the key lessons from the story are:-1. That wise men (ie experts) are not always that wise.2. Government intervention to solve a problem is not always that successful and often does a lot of damage.3. It is sometimes far better for a government to simply find a way to accommodate a problem rather than try and fix it.
5,A Favorite,"This was one of my favorites when I was a small child, so I bought a copy for my nephew when he was just starting to read."
5,Jazz? Modern? relaxing? no all of the above!,"I am a ""jazz"" fan and came across this album by total accident on AmazonComparable to George Winston, or maybe ""the piano lesson"" sound track but yet remains original.The only problem with Zampino? Doesn't have the stoplight on him yet.. but thats just a matter of time!A must have!"
4,Really Like This Tee,"I purchased this T-Shirt back in 20007 and I wear it at least once a week, and it still looks almost new. The color hasn't faded and the Adidas Logo hasn't cracked, and didn't shrink much, if at all. Mine is in red and I decided it's time to get another one, in another color. Affordable and a good buy."
4,Heel Grips,My Wife had a problem walking when her heels slipped out of her shoes all the time. I ordered the Heel Grip devices to put in her shoes. That problem is now corrected. No more heel slipping.
4,Not too bad,"The item isn't too bad. My shoes were too long so these help my heels fit a little better. If it was a half size bigger, it would probably make it fit. Mine is a full size bigger. While it definitely helps, it doesn't work as well as I expected.Also, whenever I slide in and out of my shoes, the grip would peel a little, so I would have to hold it down with my finger so that the grips stay on the shoes. If my shoes were only half a size smaller, I imagine it would peel off everytime I insert my feet in there. My shoes are penny loafers, for what it's worth."
3,They seems to be okay,"my heel kept slipping out of a pair of shoes I bought, I have not tried them on as yet."
1,Not even good enough for a cruise ship,"I received this album as a gift and have donated it to the Salvation Army since. Sorry, but this one is a waste of your money. As a radio show host, I used to play Etta's old music, and of course the old time favorite ""At Last"", to everyone's delight. Times have changed, and Etta's voice is beyond ""mature"". Her attempt at ""Calling You"" is painful; Jevetta Steele, who recorded it for the movie ""Bagdad Cafe"" is so uniquely perfect in her rendition of the song, but Etta just doesn't cut it. Worse, her baritone (!) really ruins the mesmerizing melody of its chorus.""Purple Rain"" is a similar trainwreck, especially if you were there when Prince sang it, when the movie came out ... need I say more? It just does not work. Aging gracefully is not easy, and after Beyonce outdid la grande dame Etta at the Neighborhood Ball (imho) it is definitely time to rest those vocal chords. I'd give no star if I could."
3,Pretty Good,"the Highlight for me of course was Etta James doing R.Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly""&after hearing this I would like to see R.Kelly compose some tracks for her in the future.""I't's a Mans World"" is tight as well.everything else is Hit&Miss for me. but Etta James still got it."
4,Mellow Etta Is Still Satisfying,"Etta James has rocked harder and longer than any other blues diva. That she has decided to take a rest with ""All the Way"" is understandable and the results are still somewhat satisfying. ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is pure inspiration - Etta Style. We can forgive the dull ""Calling You"" (with the annoying cell phone), but she fails to make ""Somewhere"" her own - and that's a disappointment. The song simply goes nowhere. But, James does deliver an understated and souful version of ""Imagine"". ""What's Going On"" is as smooth as silk. The highlight of the album, however, is ""Purple Rain"". Who else but Etta James could cover a Prince classic? She thunders her way through it with a hot intensity reminding the listener of the wonders of this ageless treasure of a voice. So, it's not a perfect album, it's still Etta James!"
3,All the Way - Etta James,"I wanted this CD quite badly and was somewhat disappointed. I have been an Etta James fan for over 40 years. Her voice is much deeper and throaty, but the selections of songs just weren't to my liking. Hope her next one is better. One great review is how great she looks."
1,"The ""starless"" wonder","This item is the largest disappointment I have ever had from Amazon and does not deserve to be in their warehouse. I bought it as a gift and the person returned it to me because they could not get it to work properly. I also tried to make it work without success. As a pedometer, it would record steps whether you were walking or just sitting, the time setting recorded to its own whims, and the distance would have been great, had it been accurate. It would claim 1200 steps in 5 minutes and claim a distance of 2.7 miles - record setting I believe! It is trashed and replaced. I also wrote to the company for support in fixing the problem, but they chose not to respond because they probably know it can't be done!!"
3,Nice pictures but not enough poses and recommendations,I found the book lack guidelines on yoda poses that you should avoid while being pregnant. It also could include more challeging poses for those who are more fit and experience in yoga.
5,The story of a forgotten rock band,"A must see movie for those who are seattle grunge fans. The love rock band MOTHER LOVE BONE, compised of the late great frontman Andrew Wood, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard now of Pearl Jam. This interview filled movie shows the rise and the fall of what I feel to believe a forgotten rock super band. They have all the elements of what a band should be. From emotionaly torn ballads to heart pumping pure rock and roll. The sudden death of Andrew Wood might of been the start of Pearl Jam. But it was the end of what could of been better. LOVE ROCK BABY!!!"
5,Classic Midnight Syndicate,"""Realm of Shadows"" is a tremendous followup to ""Born of the Night."" Set in an abandoned village by the sea, the disc incorporates some outdoorish atmosphere with their classic gothic symphonies. ""Soliloquy"", the beautiful piano piece is my personal favorite along with ""Legions of the Dead"" and the album-closer, ""Eclipse.""This is a particularly good MidSyn disc for those of you who like to listen to the music while drawing, writing, or reading. Sets a great atmosphere.They are the masters of what they do and this disc is no exception. Excellent!"
3,Realm of mediocrity,"I must say that in investigating the world of Midnight Syndicate over the past year I found that this CD seems to be the most-talked about, highly-praised and least available of their releases. Now, that I have it in my possession (the 5th Midnight Syndicate CD I have bought in 10 months) I find it to be kind of bland compared to Gates Of Delirium and The 13th Hour (although it's a step up from Born Of The Night which walks the fence between creepy and corny). While the mood and sound effects on Realm Of Shadows are nice (the crows on the CD made me think I had one trying to build a nest on my balcony), there are really no tracks that stand out. They all just kind of run together. I'm not saying it's awful. Like most things in life, it just doesn't live up to the hype."
4,Useful Map,"A comprehensive map of the trails (including roads and tracks closed to cars) of the area around Big Basin, focusing on the southwestern section (Map 1 focuses on the northeastern area, both include most of Big Basin Redwoods). Good detail, including property jurisdictions, topographic (40 foot contour intervals), points of interest and conveniences like road mileage markers. It also includes rules and regulations for the various parks, general , natural history and contact information for each. Limited notes on trail trail mileages is a minus.This is a handsome map printed on plastic, map on one side, other information on the reverseA great resource for finding and enjoying hikes of any length in the area."
4,A thoughtful how to on spiritual formation,"Of all the books I have read so far on spiritual formation, I have probably appreciated Ackerman's the most. He was incredibly thoughtful in putting together his information, acknowledging that not all congregations are the same, and suggesting the different ways to work with different types of congregations. I still think at times his assessments and approaches are just a little too formulaic, but this remains one of the best resources available for the spiritual formation of congregations."
1,Not satisfied,"I am personally not satisfied with this product. I would not buy it again, too much oil in it."
1,Horrible...,"It's a struggle to get through one of these. I tried to finish them but can't bring myself to eat anymore(I finished 3 bars in about 6 days). This is definitely not one of the tastiest nutrition bars out there(It's not the worst tasting, just not for me). It also makes me queazy. I recommend Larabar & Cliff bar, among others."
1,disappointed,This product was so disappointing that I discarded the entire box after trying one bar. There are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste.
2,"Tastes okay I guess, odd flavor/texture","Besides the color and texture which was so off-putting that I almost couldn't make myself try it, they were edible..at first. Their nutritional value isn't that great:~Way too high of fat (18g as it stated on BAR, 16g stated on website)~High Carbs (30)~Too much sugar (10g)~Little vitamin value/low fiber~the only redeeming quality is 9g of protein.These bars are slimy and thick textured like pulverized grass mixed with oil. They are very oily. After the first one I couldn't make myself eat another so that was it for me. I won't repurchase or buy any other flavor."
1,No food item returns to Amazon: Sickly weak queasy stomach feeling after eating the bar for 4 hours or more.,"Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more. I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time. You cannot return these or any food items to Amazon.The Coconut was moist and tender, yet no good flavor. Taste, smells of cheap food grade oil.The Spirulina is too try and chalky, too much dried Spirulina in one bar.Again bad taste no good alive flavor.Spirulina and Cashew,Coconut Agave Nectar,Elisha @ elishachristian@earthlink.net"
5,Prefect snack,If you are craving sweet and want a healthy alternative this is it....These bars are a staple at our house. I highly recommend giving them a try...
5,"is there a ""healthy"" bar that tastes ok?",I recently purchased these bars and they more then met my expectations. I was looking for an afternoon snack that will get me through an afternoon. I have since purchased other flavors and again I was pleasantly suprised with the taste and effectiveness.
5,live food bars,we love these. the price is right. the ingredients are pure and simple. the less processed...the better.
4,pretty good,Not too bad. They have a lot of calories in them and they are a little greasy but I would buy them again. I have yet to try out any of the other flavors. Over all it's good.
3,Dry bars occasionally,"I subscribe to this product on Amazon and generally love the product. However, the bars occasionally arrive dry and spoiled. I wanted to return the bad boxes but the seller does not allow returns or direct messaging. I'll have to reconsider my next order because 2 out of my last four boxes had dry spoiled bars inside."
3,Bars good - smaller size now for same price,"I ordered these bars last year and now again - a bar previously was 2.2oz, now it is only 1.8oz - same price. Too bad - luckily there are alternatives."
5,Healthy energy,I get busy & don't always take time to eat. I can grab a Spirulina Dream bar & get some quick energy for work or sports. I like the nutty taste.
3,I'd rate higher if it wasn't so high is fat.,"Yes it is made with ""good"" things but it is still high in calories and FAT. I'd eat an apple before eating another one of these. It is also on the sweet side and good if you thought it wouldn't be. On another note: it is filling. Just check out the label before you order."
