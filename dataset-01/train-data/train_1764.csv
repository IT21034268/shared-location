1,GLOW BY JLO LOTION,THIS HAS THE SCENT OF GLOW BUT ITS NOT VERY MOISTURIZING. ITS WATERED DOWN TOTALLY. THIS SHOULD BE $2. SORRY JLO BUT THE LOTION SHOULD BE THICK WITH SOME KIND OF BUTTER AT LEAST SHEA BUTTER. YES I DO LIKE GLOW BUT THIS NEEDS SOME WORK!
5,Love This!,"My kids aged 21/2 and 7months love this. My daughter sings along and my son just loves the songs. He sings and coos and kicks away,"
3,good but could be better,This definitely serves the purpose it was made for but the way it slides together leaves much to be desired.I had a lot of problems keeping everything in the bottom part just right while trying to slide on the top part.
1,Arrived cracked,Product arrived cracked in two places with no indication on the packaging that damage happened during transit. Returns process with Amazon was excellent.
4,Quintessential Gothic,"I have fond memories of girlhood afternoons spent with Joan Aiken's heroines, between Joan and Mary Stewart I think my early adulthood was blighted waiting for a gothic adventure like the ones so delightfully detailed here. Joan Aiken, better known for her children's books, was a prolific novelist in the second half of the twentieth century. Her books for adults are gothics, both contemporary and historical, of the plucky heroine variety finding unexpected adventure in an exotic setting. A Cluster of Separate Sparks fits the formula, but good characterization and humour set this above the formulaic usual.Georgia follows her cousin to Greece just in time to witness her murder. As she tries to find the culprit and stay alive, she finds adventure and romance in the castle and school of a wealthy man who employed her cousin as a psychiatrist for the troubled children in his care. Sharp dialogue, romantic settings and proto-feminism set this above the usual pulp offerings."
3,Aiken does it right again.,"After her ""Beware of the Bouquet"", Joan Aiken wrote something like five adult novels after that which all were too problematic to recommend. With a ""Cluster of separate sparks"", finally she wrote another work that I enjoyed. ""Cluster"" follows Daphne, a girl who goes to a Greek island looking for work that her icy but brillant cousin found for her, but things get complicated when the cousin is murdered and Daphne can't prove it; then her plane to Athens is hijacked by Arabs disguised as Orthodox priests, and then she is let off near the estate of a reclusive and rich man who cares for a number of children, some the unfortune children of the famous. Our heroine falls in love with the rich man, but has to struggle with the fact that someone is trying to kill her. Slowly, the truth about her cousin and her involvement in an international plot is revealed, and their is a climax near a swarm of massive butterflies. Comic reading."
5,Delicious Indian cuisine at home!,"Three years ago, I purchased this book wishing to recreate dishes that I had at local Indian restaurants and to save money. I got more than I bargained for! Since then I bought several other Indian cookbooks, but I cook from this book most often. I no longer need to go to restaurants to taste Indian cuisine because I can cook better! Everything I cooked so far were delicious; I have impressed my Indian friends! Legume and vegetable sections are especially good for people who wants to have more vegetables in their diet and enjoy them too. I think many recipes are from northern India. Ms. Chandra gives menu suggestions and how to vary a dish with her charming writing style. Thank you Mrs. Chandra!"
3,A good book for the beginner only,"This book is well written and organized (as one would expect from this author) and I'm not sorry I bought it, but it is not a star of my collection. The beginner will find it an excellent overview and introduction to east Indian cuisine, but it provides very little that is new for the serious collector of Indian cookbooks."
1,The product never arrived,"I never got my purchase, never got a mail telling that the were returning the slides, so I think this is not a serious shop and Amazon is losing points with their clients."
4,Informative and inspiring,"Mary Kay started out her life taking care of her ill grandfather when she was only six years old while her mother worked to provide for the family. She was always motivated by her mother who said, ""You can do it."" Mary Kay Ash has inspired hundreds of thousands of women to reach, extend, and grow into lives they deserve- lives that are balanced, rich and abundant.This book is a combination of morals,truths and money sense. It combines the wisdom of Mary Kay, information from financial experts, and real-life lessons from Mary Kay Independent Sales Directors and National Sales Directors. It is motivating for any aspiring woman entrepreneur."
5,Great book for a young dancer,"This is a wonderful book for an aspiring ballerina during her first few years - I'd say up to about age 10. It is more substantial than most ""ballerina"" books, but isn't just heavy technique that are in adult ballet books. It really fills the niche for that age group."
3,Toynk Toys no longer has the Valentino,I ordered this through Amazon and received one promptly. Their turn around is excellent. Unfortunately Toynk no longer stocks the Valentino and if you order through here you will receive a standard green Cthulhu.
5,Valentino (RED) Cthulhu,"Love this plush, but had a mix up with one of the online stores. Apparently the manufacturer labeled a bunch of the green ones (standard Cthulhu) with the Valentino (red) UPC code. So if you're going for red and the title is Valentino but the picture shows green, trust me, it's green. The store I bought mine from understood the error and had no problem with me returning it and gave me a full refund (including shipping costs) in a very timely manner, so don't worry if the mix up happens to you, too. :) <3 Cthulhu <3"
3,"Manx Cats: Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Groom","This book gave good general info on cats, but not much, in particular, for Manx's. I was looking for details on their elimination problems due to lack of tail, and how to deal with it as far as special diets, etc. But, the possibility of elimination problems weren't even addressed in this book."
4,Playgirl meets her match.,"What I liked best about this story was that it was told by two people---Jill and Craig. They couldn't be more different. Jill loves flirting and partying while Craig wants to be practical and serious. It's a pretty good story, but not totally original."
3,This was a good book!,"I read this book, He's The One, by Nina Alexander and thought it was very good. I would rate it as a 3 star book. It was interesting and held my attention well. This is the reason that I stuck with it and read the whole book. It was about a girl who enjoyed dating a lot of guys until she met the one boy who she fell in love with. Then she realized that she only wanted to be with him, and not him along with 10 other guys. I liked the plot of it being on the beach. And I liked the ending because it was happy. However, I've read even better books of this kind so that is why I gave it a 3 star. But I liked it because I like sappy love stories like that one!"
5,One of the best of late 70s rock,"This is one of the greatest Bowie albums. And yes, he was on drugs, making this album all the more remarkable. A hard rock funk creation that bridged Bowie's glam era with his new age art rock period, Station to Station grinds into the rock pantheon. The soaring, epic title track, the still-popular ""Golden Years"", awesome ""Stay"", every track on this album is a gem to behold. The two ballads, in particular, showcase the extent of Bowie's vocal talents."
5,Bowie's Masterpiece,"This is probably one of Bowie's most commerical albums. Strong from start to finish. I can't get enough of that 10 minute opener! A good, albeit shortened, version appears on ""Stage"". The tracks are all solid, no fillers; we get six (long) awsome Bowie songs. In particular, check out the title track, ""Word on a Wing"" and ""Stay"". The album is a perfect bridge between his plastic soul period and the more avant garde Brian Eno-trilogy to come. This is the cd that really got me hooked on the Thin White Duke."
5,Wonderfully wild and free.,I've always loved the open and free sense of creativity and expression in this album. In a literal sense it's an odd album ( like many of Bowies albums ) but he manages to pull it of in a way that is tremendous and magnificent.Beautiful work from an extremely creative and dynamic person.
5,Rigorous Follow-up To Young Americans,"The already established 'thin white duke' continued his 'fame' with the single release of ""Golden Years"", a warm, but tepid dance song that introduced the fantastic ""Station To Station"". The title track clocks in the lengthiest of his songs and provides a series of bridges and chorus changes that surpassed anything he had done to date. The entire sound is more bluesy with the power-ballads ""Word On A Wing"" and ""Wild Is The Wind"". ""Stay"" is is the funkiest and most 'blue-eyed' of the set, while ""TVC15"" simply delivers a well written novelty tune. This set was more of a second version of ""Young Americans"" rather than a new direction, but if it's not broke - don't fix it. That's pretty hard for soemone like Bowie to do, considering how many 'costume changes' he goes through each year."
4,Station to Station,"Well The Thin White Duke does it again!One of my all time favorite songs whenever I feel out-of-it with the world is ""Wild is the Wind"". It reminds me that here I belong.""Stay"" reinforces that notion! Great palate of Bowie Moods ~"
5,Essential Bowie,"Station to Station along with Young Americans are essential Bowie releases!These two albums fuse jazz, funk and rock, leaving the listener clamoring for more.And the vibe from Station to Station can't be topped!"
3,Rated over,"Despite the unquestionable innovation and influence to popular rock music, even in his relative prime STS represents for me the artist at his non-essential, decidedly decent best."
4,Wish I was there,"This is according to my own weird taste: Listen to this music and pay attention to every second that you hear of Robert Smith's incredible voice, and notice the gloomy wall of synths used on Charlotte Sometimes and One Hundred Years. That's how I enjoy it. One thing though: get Concert, it's even better."
5,"Don't know about the video, but the CD is fine!","This contains the most compelling mix of Figurehead (orginally on Pornography). In a slightly slower tempo, the song becomes even more gloomy and menacing than in the original version. Extended keyboards also add to the impression. This track makes the CD a must. Most other tracks are as impressive as, or more than, the original versions."
2,Comfy but not exactly my taste.,"I received these sneakers as a gift. They are very comfortable but not exactly my taste in the style department. But like I said, they are very comfortable."
5,Excellent recording,"Having not yet listened to Williams' all-Barrios CD, I have to say that this is the best recording of Barrios I have heard. Russell plays with grace and beauty, and, above all, feeling.Favorite track: Las Abejas."
3,Alexander-Sergei Ramirez,"I think I've listen 5-6 different versions for many of Barrios works. From all of them, the one that stands out is the CD from Alexander-Sergei Ramirez."
5,A must for those new to Barrios,"I didn't like Barrios the first time I heard his music (John Williams - a Barrios and Ponce Sony cassette). But then this is the third CD I've heard of David Russell: He not only has a wonderful technique; he has a wonderfully intuitive feel for whatever I've heard him play. And the way he orders the pieces he plays creates maximum contrast in the music. This disc is sending me back to listen to Williams, and to try to hear more Latin American music for the classical guitar."
5,Perfect potablity,"The size of this journal is its strength. It's thin and compact in dimensions to lend itself usable for travel writing. Plus the covers offer a uniqueness to the journal - rather appropiate for the personale nature of journal writing. Further, the journal is lined, with albeit rather thin spacing."
3,Iffy readings,"I bought two, and had them side by side in the fridge for a while. Typically they were about 5-8 degrees different, which is a big difference in a fridge. The one seemed to be a little low, so I use that in the freezer now and keep the one that seems more accurate in the fridge."
3,Needs Quality Control,"I purchased two of this model of Taylor thermometer. To test them, I placed both in my freezer, next to each other. One consistently read five degrees colder than the other! A third thermometer of a different brand was the tiebreaker. I returned the ""colder"" thermometer to Amazon and got a replacement Taylor, which works fine."
2,OK thermometers,I bought 2 of these after my fridge failed. They serve their function but better quality control is needed. The 2(side by side) read different temperatures!!! I would not have bought them if I had known they were made in China.
3,Not calibrated,Received two of these. I left them in the same spot for a while. Came back to check and they both read differently. One was almost accurate to a thermometer I have nearby and the other was almost 3 degrees off. I placed both in the freezer and came back to find the same thing; 3 degree difference. There is no way to adjust the calibration either.
1,Unreliable,"I purchased two and already the first one is inaccurate, the refrigerator temperature 50 degree range indicates spoilage, I used an older and reliable thermometer to confirm the new one is accurate, the new one is also made in China"
5,simple but effective,In Marc Bittman's cookbook he suggested putting a thermometer in both the fridge and the freezer to make sure foods are being kept at the correct temperature. I got 2 of these Taylor's and found that the temperature in both compartments were too warm. After bringing them to the correct temperature I could see (and taste) the difference. There are lots of choices for this kind of thermometer but the Taylor's are economical and efficient. They're also easy to read and don't take up much space. I highly recommend them.
5,serv safe,"My fridge was left open one night and was trying to set the right # for the temp of my fridge. This does the trick, now I know when the temp is too warm or too cold and what is safe to eat. I love it."
5,"works well, easy to read","i should have bought this years ago. Will never trust another oven temp meter again.This unit has big numbers, easy to read dial, and gives accurate baking temps which translate into perfectly baked dishes every time. multiple ways to mount this thermometer in the oven via this unit.it's amazing how much my stove was ""off"" in terms of temp accuracy. how hard is it for oven manufacturers to build in this reliability?inexpensive price, highly useful product. hope it lasts for years!"
1,cheap thermometer at a price to match,"Thermometer was not very accurate, and the needle broke off after falling only 2 feet. Save your money, don't buy this poor quality item."
5,works in the beer fridge,"it has helped me control my beer fridge temperature, now every brew is the perfect temperature and thusly more satisfactory"
1,Taylor refridgerator thermometer,"I ordered two of these. One did not work. Taylor's policy is they will replace an item at their discretion, so at the price charged you might just as well do what I did: chuck it. My feeling is that Taylor's quality control is near zero, hence the low price. The item was made in China. If you receive working thermometers then the value is excellent."
1,Not accurate,"The thermometer is large, easy to read, and has a quality look and feel. However, it's not accurate. I checked it against 3 known accurate thermonmeters. Specifically it reads high by almost 5 degrees. That might be acceptable if measuring molten steel but a couple degrees in a refrigerator thermometer is a lot."
4,Good product,"I bought two; one for the freezer and one for the refrigerator.GOOD: Good size and easy to read.NOT SO GOOD: Not so good but not catastrophic either.Each of the two, when calibrated against a thermometer I know to be accurate to the degree, was off by 4 degrees.For use in the freezer, or the refrigerator, I'll be happy to accept a 4 degree error.Overall, it's a good buy for the intended use. I would not hesitate to repurchase."
5,A True Classic,"No frills! Simple, basic, sturdy, and exactly what I wanted. Easy to read numbers at a glance, as well as even easier to read color coded zones. I like the options of either hanging it two different ways, or setting it on a shelf.I would highly recommend this thermometer without hesitation."
5,Invaluable in the frig,I was concerned that my refrigerator was not keeping food cool enough since I had discovered a small crack in the lining. I found this invaluable and check it daily to make sure my frig is at the right safe temp. I love that it has large writing that I can see without having to get my glasses. It is very accurate and well made. Very economical as well.
5,Excellent use!,"This little device is super easy to read, sturdy, and light. It has helped us get our fridge into order and much more evenly chilled. Highly recommend!"
1,not accurate,This thermometer is inexpensive but not worth the low cost as it is off by at least 10 degrees. I could have a defective device but not worth the shipping cost and time to return.
4,Keeping an eye on refrigerator efficiency,I just move to a new rental and wanted to be sure the refrig was working properly. This is just the perfect thermometer for this.
2,"Close, but not close enough",I bought two of these thermometers and they have a two degree disagreement. Not a big deal unless you are trying to keep your food less than 40F in the safe zone and keeping your insulin from freezing.
5,"Accurate, and well made","The Taylor Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometer is accurate and well made. The temperature range extends to room temperature, so you can check against a room thermometer as well as against freezing (32 degrees)and assume that if those are correct so is everything else. I put this one in the refrigerator, I'll be ordering another one for the freezer compartment."
2,Spend a little more....,2 out of the 6 I purchased were broken right out of the box. The others don't seem to very accurate.
3,Large Dial,"I bought this for my RV refrigerator because of the large, easy to read dial. It does the job than I expected."
5,"Taylor Food Service Classic Series Freezer-Refrigerator Thermometer, Large DialTaylor Food Service Classic Series Freezer-Refri",Excellent thermometer for my refrigerator that only has a numeric temp adjustment knob. It is nice to see when temps drop and adjustment is needed. The Taylor product looks well built and should last forever.
5,Solved an argument with my husband!,"I don't have any way to hang this, but I insisted that our refrigerator wasn't keeping food cold enough, as my greens were going bad too quickly. My husband insisted that this model fridge should be at a mid-level to keep it all cold. After a few days of testing with this thermometer, it became clear that BOTH the freezer AND fridge had to be set to the coldest. He couldn't argue with that and I have had no problem since. It's very sturdy and easy to read. Very happy I got it."
5,"Large, consistent accuracy","Good large size, accurate, however, please note the Refrigeration temp range is vague compared to the freezing and warmer temps. If you're looking for more precision, this is not your gauge."
4,"not digital, but works for what you need","bought this because my ice cream was going soft in the freezer. dont get me wrong, it's easier to eat and scoop out of the canister, but i was getting worried about the meats, etc.the item arrived quickly and in good shape. packaging was all brand new.when i opened it, i was surprised at how light it is and thought that it probably wouldn't work well. however, it measured temperatures just fine in the fridge and in the freezer.i appreciated how it has a color band along the temperatures that tell you what temperatures you should be looking for.it helped me talk to my landlord about my issues with the fridge/freezer and he quickly remedied the problem with the fridge/freezer. so this thermometer now has a permanent home in my freezer - love how it can hang from the rack inside with it's little hook. good job little thermometer."
3,Okay for the price,It worked but would freeze itself so hard to see the temp. This was for my moms frig so maybe she needs a new fridge but you get what you pay for.
2,"Taylor Food Service Classic Series Freezer- Rafrigerator Thermometer, Large Dail","I purchased two of these at the same time, one for my refrigerator and one for my up-right freezer. I placed both in the refrigerator to check accuracy when I got them. After a full day, the reading on each was different by a few degrees. So I don't know which one is correct, or if either one is accurate. I didn't send them back because they are fairly cheap. The old saying, ""You get what you pay for"" is correct."
2,Accuracy Not Good,"If you buy this thermometer, you better check it against a known, accurate unit. I placed this in my refrigerator and it registered in the mid 40's most days. Thinking I had a problem, I paid for a service call. After the tech checked out the refrigerator, we checked the temperature using another thermometer - the Taylor unit was reading around 6 degrees high - so I paid $75 for that service!!! I put another thermometer on the same shelf and have been tracking the differneces now for several weeks. The Taylor unit is not consistant - it generally reads warmer, but anywhere from 1 to about 8 degrees difference. I need to toss it."
5,2nd purchase!!!,I found this product very reliable. The thermostat in my refrigerator - not so much. It is nice to double check to make sure my foods are at proper temperature. We found out after purchasing our first thermometer that our fridge wasn't working properly. Just bought this second one for my parents refrigerator. Great product - highly recommended = especially if you have children that open and shut the fridge door - shocking at how that drops the temp very fast.
3,Technical mastery,"and precision. No small feat, especially for the Rach. However, the recording is sterile and lacks excitement."
5,Howard Jones still kicks a butt or two,"Howard Jones has a style unto his own and although seems to vanish into obscurity is much more than a one hit wonder... the vocals and styling, leave me looking back at a time in my youth, when we knew the songs but perhaps did not know the artist. Now when I hear the songs, I am transported, and I remember... I know exactly where I was when I heard ""Things can only get better,"" and I remember who I was with when I first heard, ""What is Love"" and I also remember what was happening in my life when I heard, ""No one is to blame"" I hope that HoJo never stops writing music that is so loved... If I hear of a new album... I will buy it!"
3,"Not the version of ""No One is to Blame"" I bought the cd for","Apparently the version of ""No One is to Blame"" on this cd is an earlier recording of the song than the one that got airplay at the time. The later recording is better in my opinion, so I'm disappointed with the disc. Otherwise it's OK, though."
2,Some Nostalgic value,"This album covers Howard Jone's singles from 1983-1993. It would have been a better album if it had stopped at 1989. The album does have some nostalgic value (at least it does for me) and a couple of great singles, like What is Love?, Things Can Only Get Better, Life In One Day, You Know I love you, Noone is to Blame, Everlasting love, and Like to Get to Know You Well. Beyond those singles, the rest of the album is pretty weak, in my opinion.I was a big fan of New Wave in the 80's and there is no doubt that Howard Jones was a piece of the puzzle that was 80's synth-pop. If you are looking to recapture a piece of your past and Howard Jones was part of it, by all means buy this album. It is worth it for the memories that the handful of good songs on it resurrect. If you already have Dream Into Action, don't bother with this one."
4,One of the best singers of the 1980s,"There are some songs that I like in this collection like ""What Is Love?,"" ""Things Can Only Get Better,"" ""No ONe is To Blame,"" and ""Everlasting Love."" HOward Jones has always had a great voice and probably still does. His music is soulful and smooth. I was surprised to like the song, ""I.G.Y (What A Beautiful World),"" which became a personal favorite. The other songs in this collection like ""New Song,"" ""Pearl In The Shell,"" ""Always Asking Questions,"" ""Like To Get To Know You Well,"" ""Life In One Day,"" ""You Know I Love You.. Don't You?,"" ""Hide And Seek,"" ""Look Mama,"" ""The Prisoner,"" ""Lift Me Up,"" ""Tears To Tell,"" ""Two Souls,"" and ""City Song"" are only some of his greatest music. I don't think Howard Jones and his music or voice should ever be forgotten. I think his voice is timeless and his songs are classic love ballads."
4,Better than I even hoped it would be.,"Before this disc I had his ""Live Acoustic America"" album, and while that was good, getting these studio versions I'm used to hearing is 10 times better. This is a must own for all fans of synth, new wave, 80's pop, and music in general. I also knew alot more than the five or so tracks that I thought I did. Of course this is well worth it just for ""What Is Love?"", ""Things Can Only Get Better"", ""Life In One Day"", and the moving ballad ""No One Is To Blame"". I also found that I like ""New Song"", ""Everlasting Love"", and ""Lift Me Up"" quite a bit. Overall this is just alot of really great songs, and perfect for playing the air-keyboard to."
5,The Best of Howard Jones,"Good Synth-Pop from England in the guise of Howard Jones. My favorites on this collection: ""What is Love,"" ""Things can only get better,"" and ""City Song."" Five stars for this collection!"
4,Almost a 5,"I really only know his top 40 hits and I have the 12"" single to ""Things Can Only Get Better"", but this would have been scored a 5 if the song ""Will You Still Be There"" would have been included. I remembering hearing this song on the radio but it never reached the top 40 (too bad). If I'm not mistakened, it came out around winter time. It brings back a bunch of memories when I hear it and is one of my favorites by Mr. Jones. I'm still glad I bought this great compilation!!!"
3,Best Of Hojo,"A good representation of Jones' best work. It's good to have the tunes with his signature sound all in one place, but there are some unspectacular selections here. His cover of Fagen's IGY is a pleasant surprise for those of us who are diehard fans of Donald and The Dan."
3,Very nice table cloth but beware of shrinkage!,"Lovely tablecloth but even with washing in cold water and line drying, this table cloth shrunk at least 10 inches on the long side and 5 inches on the short side making it too short for my table. Just be aware that, with washing this tablecloth will shrink. In my case, I am ordering another one, one size up. Otherwise, it is a lovely tablecloth."
3,Interesting,This must of went STRAIGHT TO VIDEO. I collect Hearst info so this is part of the collection. Kristen Dunst is good as Marion Davies.
2,Kirsten's too young to play Marion Davies,"I finally got the VHS copy of ""The Cat's Meow"" and was looking forward to a ""fluff"" evening. Well, fluff it was. The movie really didn't have a 1920's feel to it. The costumes were ok, but those hats the women wore! Jennifer Tilly just about drove me up the wall with her voice but Joanna Lumely's voice was pure heaven. It could have been a good movie but all I could give it was 3 stars."
1,Not good,"This movies tries to represent a time in the golden age of Hollywood, but they can't represent it. In occassions actors don't know what to do, how to play their characters. Kirsten Dunst play an older when she looks like a teenager, she's a good actress but far to bee the best one, and able to play any character. The story is weak and a bad plot for what it seems something real."
4,An enjoyable telling of a 90 year old Urban Legend,"The death of film maker Tim Ince on William Randolph Hurst's yacht in 1924 has long been surrounded in mystery and is a longstanding Urban Myth.However, investigation into the transfers of money (potential payoffs ??) and other events surrounding this fateful weekend makes this story appear as though it may actually be more truth than legend.This is a delightful peek into 1920s America and Hollywood and is enjoyable to see.A bit on the light side as stylistic, but very entertaining."
4,Not for everyone.,"I enjoyed the ensemble based, 'The Cat's Meow'. Though I only purchased it to see Eddie Izzard perform. The movie is pretty, and interesting enough. Though I really did like it, I'll say its not for everyone.And for god's sake, don't buy it used like I did."
3,What's the catch about the PG-13 rating?,"What I like about this movie is its good adapted screenplay (featuring a nice narration) and the fine performance of its entire cast (Kirsten Dunst and Jennifer Tilly being my favorites). What I don't like is that the producers were seemingly liable to some (interpersonal or legal?) restrictions, thus forced themselves to make this film a PG-13. Come on, what parents would think of bringing their young kids to the theater for this movie? Given the inherent mature theme (sexuality and violence involved) why not take the liberty to make a more realistic and convincing R-rated film? It would have been much more entertaining to everyone."
2,Song played during end credits??,Does anyone know the song that's played at the end of the movie during the credits?
2,Should've been great. Wasn't.,"I don't understand how such a fine cast based on real life characters with great costumes and make-up, and directed by Peter Bogdanovich could have turned out so, er, so-so.Maybe the director should stick to appearing on documentaries about other people. If this production was not his fault, then whose fault was it?"
2,A Conversation Piece,"The Roaring 20s fascinate me; and especially when combined with Tinseltown lore. Add to that a Hollywood Babylon-esque murder mystery (which may or may not have taken place), and how could I say no?This is one of those flicks where I don't like any of the characters...in fact I loathed most of them...and yet studied it as if preparing for a dissertation on the subject. And though I despise him (both the real-life Hearst and the character based on him in this film), I couldn't help but feel bad for the pathetic scumbag for what he went through with Davies.If you've got friends with an interest in history (or at least historical scandal), this movie could get some interesting conversation(s) started."
4,Interesting Hollywood History,"This movie was enjoyable to watch. I think it was accurate as a period piece, with the music, costumes, morals and attitudes, etc. I bought it for two reasons: I am curious about William Hearst's life and times and I am a huge fan of Eddie Izzard and he played the role of Charlie Chaplin. He did not disappoint!"
3,"All Style, no Substance","While Kirsten Dunst and Edward Herrmann both give fine performances, this movie is essentially just a fluffy (and historically inaccurate) costume drama. There is little evidence to support this interpretation of the events that took place on Hearst's yacht that weekend, and plenty to contradict it -- e.g. the fact that Hearst and Chaplin remained friends for years afterward. And, while Kirsten Dunst is fun to watch, she's way to young to play the part of Marion Davies at that time. Also, too much of the dialog seems ""scripted"" -- like people reciting clever lines, rather than like real conversations.Nice sets and costumes save the movie from being a complete waste of time, but unless you're a big Kirsten Dunst fan, you'll do better watching something else!"
4,"As facile as this movie may have been,","I nonetheless enjoyed it as a whole, and those not familiar at all with who W.R. Hearst was will hopefully be compelled to do some more digging into the odd fellow. An interesting story...the movie is a fun peek into the semi-decadence of people who have ascended the mountain of success and have nothing to do at the top but be amused and glib about the suffering of others, and play fast and loose with conventional morality, it having no use in such financial stratospheres. And yet, the power serves them insidiously when something truly foul happens-it can be made to disappear in such a way that ordinary folks could not. But this story doesn't have a big fat moral-really, you're watching Joanna Lumley, Edward Herrmann, Eddie Izzard and Kirsten Dunst impress you by filling their characters' shoes effectively, with wit and whimsy amongst the lavish backdrop of Twenties affluence in spite of sobriety. It's worth a look."
5,Juliette,"I love De Sade and I couldn't take that book out in the libraries, so I wanted to buy for me my own copyThanks I love that book. So enigmatic and mystic author. Thanks for your service!"
3,"Good, but long and repetitive","The translation makes the book very readable, but the story is long. One has to expect the cruelty, but the philosophy makes the book interesting, and helps one understand the morality of some of the nobility at the time. The methods of cruelty are truly inventive even if imaginative and unlikely."
1,Unclever Pornography for Educated Idiots,"It's garbage that tries to convince the reader that there is no place for morals in the world, and that anyone who tries to live a moral life deserves horrid abuse. De Sade was an idiot who obsessed over the most vile acts possible - simply because they ARE possible. To him and his fans, the virtues of restraint and kindness toward others for a common peace and progress are completely unknown - because he and they, simply, are bratty idiots.De Sade knows how malleable the human mind fan be, those who he persuades with this cheap gore-porn trash are only identifying themselves as weak-minded."
2,For those with Spare time.,"Do you know why De Sade made this book so long? I've listened too long to people talking about how De Sade is some misunderstood genius who was trying to get out everything he was thinking. The man was in Prison! It was either write or stare at the wall! Of course he made it so long. the plot of this book fills less than a sixth of the books length. The rest is filled with a list of sexual events that go past what even the most depraved minds would find arousing. It becomes disgusting to the point of giving you a bad taste in your mouth. Some times, the hideous acts don't even have anything to do with sex! they're simply hideous! And my words have nothing to do with morality. De Sade's sexual discribtions are like seeing road kill while jogging. No difference in it's ability to make one sick! Only the depraved could like this book."
5,A Slap In Conventions Face,Whatever could have compelled a good decent church going amerikan to read such a deliberate and calculated affront to everything he insipidly believes in. His erudition is very intimidating (ha ha). The Divine Marquis would have found such oafish moral reflexivity amusing.
1,Oh please,"I gotta say, I'm sitting here chuckling over the positive reviews of this book. There's really nothing positive to be said, and the work is utterly indefensible. The sex scenes are vomitous, and the philosophy puerile. It has endured this long not because of any literary merit, but as a morbid curiosity, an example of how low ""literature"" can sink. Don't get me wrong. I'm not an offended prude, a right-winger or a religious nut, I simply know crap when I read it. It's an Emperor's New Clothes deal, folks. That Sade spent time in prison for writing this stuff in a less enlightened time is regrettable. I don't suggest the book be banned or burned. Read it, if you want the experience of having done so. But let's not pretend it's something it isn't."
1,What badly put together dribble.... Sade CAN NOT write,"If you look at the book from 30,000 feet and just review it for writing style, cohesive storyline, knowledge of one's subject and some sort of skill at prose then this text is a dismal failure. Now let's throw in the story of Juliette corrupted at an early age and it goes down hill from there. I have never read such repetitive nonsense in my life. I guess Sade could get away with writing such inane dribble because people were just not aware of human anatomy and the consequences of a lot of what he writes about. A lot of the torture is not possible in the context he uses, it just won't work. If you can get past the unbelievable torture methods and just plain bad writing you have an unblievably boring story. I have to be honest and admit I started skipping pages this stuff was so dry. After awhile it doesn't disgust, it doesn't shock and it certainly never entertained. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes--Again,"This book does more than push the envelope of propriety, it blows it away. And true to form, many a ""liberal-minded"" intellectual rushes to embrace it in lock step with his credo that any subject is warranted, as long as it is not moralistic, does not restrict THEIR freedom, and is treated with even the slightest literary flair. Congratulations, Sade--your book wins the triple crown, and the dupes continue to kneel at your alter."
3,Not as good as the professional edition,I prefer the professional edition I get through my nutritionist to this one. This one is too small and hard to read.
5,Excellent all round coverage,"I especially like the fact that it not only covers Bluetooth, in a level of detail I require, but gives well balanced coverage of the related technoligies. Too many books operate in isolation of their immediate enviroment."
2,"The best Bluetooth book yet, but...","I thought that this book started well. However, as the book moved on, more and more extraneous side material creeps into each chapter, while at the same time it becomes less and less detail oriented. The result is that more and more topics are introduced but not well explained. I would have greatly preferred if fewer side topics were discussed and more detail was focused on the central issues. I ended up spending the latter 2/3s of the book feeling glazed over. I still feel that this is the best Bluetooth book on the market, but that's because most of the other books are so terrible. No matter what book you buy, you will have to read the Bluetooth spec in its entirety. This book will at least give you a broad overview that the spec is so sorely missing, though that could have been done with far fewer pages."
3,A readable reference,"A gentle, somewhat more readable and substantially more compact alternative to the official Bluetooth documentation. Technical accuracy and completeness are not sacrificed. Not an exciting cover-to-cover read by any means but still a useful volume for the corporate reference library if you're in that business."
2,Double Disaster,"If you ever heard that the Matt Helm series was entertaining, believe me, it wasn't these two entries. They, especially ""The Ambushers"", are just plain bad. Funny thing is, the other two Helm movies, especially ""The Wrecking Crew"", offer fine entertainment. It had to do with the directors, as Henry Levin directed the two bombs, and the guy, who would go on to direct the classic ""Walking Tall"", the others. There is nothing whatsoever redeemable about the Ambushers, and Murderers' Row is noteworthy simply for the appearance of Ann Margeret and an over-the-top performance as Karl Malden as the villian. Neither makes much sense at all."
4,Just for fun,"This movie is an excuse to display a lot of beautiful women teasing the viewer in provocative 60's style. If you like that, you will enjoy this movie as I did. The production values are so cheap that it is funny. The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the casual persona of Martin and the continual displays of drop dead gourgeous women. Its a fun and very simple low budget movie."
2,Matt Helm makes Austin Powers look like Smiley,"Hopelessly cheeseball, sexist comedy, but entertaining in a creepy, pathological, what-were-they-thinking-back-then kind of way. The smarm content is high, but this is one for the 60's time capsule. Prepare your jaw for much dropping."
2,Eileen Ivers: Crossing the Bridge,"As I was listening to this cd, I knew that I wasn't to be getting much in the way of traditional music. I think that Eileen Ivers may have tried to cover too many styles with this album, just to appeal to a larger audience. She was successful in this, but the album lacks the interest and tastefulness of some of her more traditional recordings. I feel that this project is very good from a musical standpoint, just not from an Irish music one. When listening to this cd, just keep in mind that this is not entirely representative of traditional music."
5,Nothing lo about this group,This is one of the best new bands I've heard in a long time!!!! The music is very edgie the vocals are awesome. If you like alternative rock LO PRO will be one of your favorite bands...Larry
5,Brilliant music by a brilliant band,"This is an excellent cd, very different from anything else out there. The singing has a very distinct tone to it which sets these songs apart from the rest of the boring music in this genre. The final song on the cd ""Bombz"" is an amazing mix of excellent guitar, melodic singing and pure passion, and surpasses anything else out there with its creativity. This is an excellent buy, well worth your money. If you like these songs, check out Ultraspank, same singer and guitarists, same creativity and passion. Awsome band."
4,Really Good at Being Average!,"Lo-Pro is one of the best run of the mill bands out there. They are just like the rest, but they are really good at it. I cannot tell the differance between songs, but i do know they are all pretty good. The sound of the band is a lot like fuel, especially the singer. A great band if you are a fan of alt rock, if youre not, dont bother. If you like this band I strongly reccomend Cold, Staind, or TRUSTcompany."
3,meh...,"I'm sure this album deserves more than I'm giving it, but I'm a bit disappointed in it, being a pretty big fan of Mr Murray when he sang for Ultraspank. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good tracks on this cd, but I think Pete was performing at his best when he was alternating hard growls and emotional singing like on the tracks ""sponge"" and ""butter"" off of Ultraspanks debut. It just fit him, and he was one of the best in the nu-metal scene. But, I guess screaming takes it's toll after a while, and he probably didn't want everyone to think the new band was an Ultraspank clone. I kind of wish it was..."
4,Awesome New Rock Band Rocks!,"Aaron Lewis found a real winner in Lo Pro and this cd shows exactly why they were signed to 413 records. Every song is great and my personal favorite is Sunday. I think this is a band that you will start to here a lot more about and their music certainly speaks for itself. I highly recommend this cd, especially cuz you can find it at record stores for cheap prices. I got it for 6.99 at Best Buy- Believe me when I say this cd is easily worth that price."
1,Not Music,Absolutely lousy. Don't waste your money. Garage band that needs to play in the garage with the door shut.
4,Good angles,"A variety of time steps are covered... I like how the video shows the steps at various speeds and at different angles so that you can better understand the rhythms, etc."
3,This movie is a bit Cheesy!,"Ok do not get me wrong it is cute, but the animation really stinks big time! I do not understand why the companies are making such [bad] animation! It feels like I am back in the 70's with these animations! They should be getting better, not worse as they are! I do not understand why this was not under the Walt Disney Company, it's like there animation as well. Overall it's good for kids to watch! It has a great story about liking yourself and like you for you not cause someone else likes you!"
3,Not sure,"Still yet one to watch. I am sure it would be great. Jennifer does an amazing job in hunchback 2, can't wait to watch it."
1,I DO NOT LIKE IT ONE LITTLE BIT!,"I do not like this movie, at all! It is nothing like disney's thumbelina! Now there's something to by! Just take my advice, do not by this for your child! They will be VERY dissapointed!P.S CHACHACHA IS A VERY LAME SONG!"
2,Disappointing,"I get a bit tired of people claiming how fantastically hard their puzzles are, only to be disappointed in the end. In the end with this book I was very disappointed. The author claims 9 Circles of Sudoku Hell, but the highest level, ""The Ninth Circle"" contains only one puzzle and it can be solved in under an hour, pretty much ditto for all the rest.I thought the master class in advanced strategies disappointing, simply a rehash of strategies known around the world.What I really came away with from this book is the knowledge that my Sudoku solving process is superior to the author's lore, and that maybe I should write a book on Sudoku solving and get the author's permission to use puzzles from this book as examples."
1,dissapointing,where to find really really hard sudokus?That one told me that it had 9 circles of sudoku hell....No way.Even the last one that was supposed to be really hardwas solved in 45 minutes....
2,Its tips are not terrific,"I bought this book for the ""master class in advanced strategies,"" not for the puzzles, and I was disappointed. The tips are skimpy and not very clearly explained. I have a Ph.D. in philosophy (which includes logic), so I am no dummy, yet several of the solving tips in the opening section I had to read three or four times until I could correctly correlate the commentary to the diagrams. If you're looking for difficult puzzles, then read the other reviews, but if you're looking for solving methods for difficult puzzles, don't buy this book."
2,No genius created this!,"Puzzles are way too easy. And, Sheldon's ""Master Class in Advanced Strategies"" is a joke. ""Trailing""? He needs to read Peter Gordon's MENSA Guide to Solving Sudoku! Learn real solving tools: X-, XY-, XYZ-wings, rectangles, fish, etc etc etc."
5,Has Blank Grids In The Back,"This has been my favorite Sudoku book. The puzzles are harder than the ""Very Challenging"" puzzles in the Will Shortz books. One of my favorite features of this book is the section of blank grids towards the end of the book. They're perfect for when you make a mistake in a puzzle and want to try again.The author says that several of the puzzles require ""Trailing"" (aka Trial and Error). However, I found that most (but not all) of those could be solved with advanced logic techniques. If you want to learn those techniques, though, you'll have to look beyond this book. The best teacher for that is the free Sudoku Susser PDF."
4,"Still has ""It"".","Anita's crystal chords are still in good shape. Her romantic, ornamental, R&B style, still works. For me, Rhythm of Love is the last, solid album in a career run that includes (in my favorite collection): Compositions, Songstress, Rapture, and Giving You The Best I've Got. Her albums just ooze love and sensuality. P.S. The CTI CD packaging is cardboard, but at least it's a coated, smooth cardboard inside the slot, unlike, some other companies that are just the rough cardboard. For the latter, I use a paper sleeve to prevent the CD from getting scratched up."
3,The SMOKEY FEMALE ALTO blazes yet another!,"What can be said about Anita Baker that already hasn't been mentioned? I'm not sure why this woman isn't mentioned in the same breathe as other R&B Divas, because she MORE than deserves it! One can only assume it is because of her long hiatus' between CD's.From the first verse of track #1, this one will send you straight in to R&B Heaven. I've always enjoyed Anita's music, the fact that she hasn't had a CD since this one makes me sad.This artists skill and vocal range is inspiring. Some of these ""johnny-come-lately-wanna-be"" R&B stars need to get OUT of the studio and LISTEN to someone like Anita who needed NO vocal engineering tricks to work her magic!I put all of her cd's in my player and hit play and not ONE song on ANY of the CD's disappoints. Don't hesitate...get this one AND the rest!"
5,Truly beautful music. Her best cd yet!,"My favorites are Body & Soul and Rhythm of Love.Anita Baker is probably the most female artist of our time. Finally, beautiful music with meaningful and inspiring words."
3,Great voice.,"Anita has a wonderfully soulful voice and there are some great tracks on this album. My only problem with Anita is you really have to be in the mood to hear her. This isn't one of those CDs you just pop in for heavy rotation in your home or car changer. She's got one of those deep rooted voices more akin to a jazz artist, no fluff here. When I'm in the right mood, Anita, Sade and Phyllis Hyman certainly fill the bill. I would recommend getting her best of album over this though. The tunes can be sort of hit and miss, so get only the good stuff on a compilation disc."
3,Baker's voice uplifts weak material,"Anita Baker's follow-up to the superb COMPOSITIONS CD is a mixed bag of some songs that are gems (the funkily haunting done-me-wrong anthem THE WRONG MAN, the sensual RYTHYM OF LOVE), and some songs that simply don't work (PLENTY OF ROOM, and the sluggish cover of YOU BELONG TO ME). Baker is a superb vocalist, one of the best ever, and she deserves better. I anxiously await a new, and hopefully improved CD."
3,i wish i didn't have to say this,"i am a devoted anita baker fan--i own all her albums, and the home video ""one night of rapture,"" and i have seen her live in concert. however, as much as i tried to force myself to like this album as much as its predecessors, i could not. it seems that anita hit her vocal peak with ""compositions"" and perhaps her four-year break (a break she needed and deserved to start her family) was too long away from the challenge of public performance. the songs on ""rhythm"" are, as a whole, not as strong as those on ""rapture"" or ""giving you the best that i've got,"" nor is her voice as unstoppable as on ""compositions."" so what's a loyal fan to do? i, for one, will continue buying her albums (isn't she about due for another one?), and enjoy ""you belong to me"" and ""it's been you"" from the ""rhythm of love"" cd. but i will anxiously await her live performances and her next album because ""rhythm of love"" just does not suffice."
2,"Anita is great, this cd, boring!","I love Anita Baker, but this was music that lacked her usual bounce, wasnt able to get into this music"
4,Just because it's Anita,"I gave this CD a very good rating, simply because she is who she is. Nonetheless, this CD just screams ""formulaic."" I say take a few of the standard R & B, uninspired fare off and throw on more ballads that allow her misty voice to float on and on...My favorites include ""Sometimes I Wonder Why"" where she teases jazz fans, and does it well. She could have left ""My Funny Valentine"" alone, as it has been covered enough (!) and her version, frankly, wasn't one of the most memorable.But under the circumstances, let her enchant you with the likes of ""The Look of Love"" and ""Only for a While."" My wish: Anita, live, jazz standards. But this album will do till then."
3,Average,This album is not as good as the other Anita Baker albums. The sounds of this record by the end sound tired and boring. But there is no denying the voice of this heaven-sent voice. She is a great singer and will rebound from this rechet album.
1,Contrary to previous reviews... hardly usable,"I see some pretty favorable reviews of this book here and I cannot help but ask, ""huh""? This book is horrible on so many levels. For starters, the typeface looks like it came straight from an inkjet printer and the obviously plagiarized graphics are often very pixilated (like what happens to satellite TV during a heavy thunderstorm). Next, regarding technical detail, it's lacking. Sure this book will give you a 30,000 foot view of the subject. After reading this book, you should be able to spell ""smart card"" but that's about it! However, I see no areas in the text which a competent project manager could use to help determine their needs and how the technology can help them. There's nothing a developer can use in this book to help them integrate smart card technology into their project. Unfortunately, this isn't the first IT book out there filled with hundreds of pages of nothing. If you're looking for some shelfware, this book is an excellent buy!"
2,An early writer's common faux pas,"The author didn't narrow his subject and sharpen his focus. It's a common problem to people working on a thesis.He opens with a chapter on the impact when the connection was revealed after the war. He follows with one on the nature of Intelligence. Then on on to the lack of funding for Swiss intelligence in the early years of the war. The exciting drama is the connection itself, which I haven't come to yet. After 60 pages I gave up and put the book down. Maybe I will return to see if I can pick up a nugget or two."
2,Glad I'm not the only one!,"So for awhile I thought I was the only one who coughed and sneezed while trying to enjoy this seasoning because my husband can eat it on popcorn with no problem. First taste and I thought I was going to die. I immediately coughed and half chewed popcorn flew everywhere, even though I tried to cover my mouth. I can't even be near it because it gets in my nose and makes me sneeze. The flavor wasn't bad so if you aren't bothered by a fine powder scratching the back of your throat and nose then enjoy!"
3,Could've been 5 stars,"I love all the Kernel Seasons flavors, they make bland popcorn taste great. The problem is you can't enjoy it when you're coughing and sneezing to death.And after reading other reviews I can see I'm not the only one.What a shame, they need to reformulate this or do something before a lawsuit happens."
5,Very effective as an expectorant or deterrent to attackers,"This stuff made me cough and sneeze like crazy when I first tried it on my popcorn. I imagine it could distract an angry dog long enough to allow one to flee unharried. As a seasoning, however, it is an acquired taste."
4,Zesty Taste,"I like the zing this spice mix adds to popcorn. I find it benefits from added cheese, so I mix this with the white cheddar."
2,This COUGH product COUGH is COUGH bad.,"I bought the jalapeno seasoning thinking it would be a great flavor to add to my popcorn. The good part is that it does indeed taste decent. However, the seasoning is so fine that it makes me cough whenever I try to breath; it gets into my nose and also makes me sneeze. I'm thinking about returning this as the product needs to be improved for me to even consider purchasing another one."
3,What the COUGH,"This flavor hurts. It tastes good, but the trick is that you need to put it on the popcorn and then let it sit for a few hours on buttered or oiled popcorn. If you don't, your nose will feel attacked every time you eat a piece. It feels like wasabi. I don't have this reaction with the other flavors so I would have to guess that it is realy jalapeno powder bothering my histamines.I am not the only one to have this reaction. Everyone but one of us was coughing and sneezing.The exception is when I added it to leftover popcorn and ate it the next day.....The taste is great but they REALLY need to do something about the reactions people get while eating it."
3,"Too powdery, doesn't stick.","I make air popped popcorn without butter. My hope was to add some flavor to the popcorn without adding calories. This product is spicy and tastes okay, but its too powdery to be useful. First off, it is so finely ground that it doesn't stick to the dry popcorn. Even worse, it tends to float in the air and I end up inhaling it (which is unpleasant). I think for this to work I'd have to wet the popcorn in some way (with water or butter?) to get it to stick, but I'm not looking for that level of effort. I now use a low calorie 'butter' spray instead. Much easier."
1,Really?,Did no one in R&D or marketing try this before sending it out to the market? Everyone in my household is coughing and sneezing from the too fine dried jalapeno. This is nearly like mace. Makes a great white elephant gift.
1,"Religious propaganda, masquerading as romance","This novel hides several agendas. For one thing, there is utterly no mention anywhere on the cover or interior that it's another installment of a published series. Since this is critical to the story, this omission, deliberate or accidental, is unforgivable.Pushed as a 'romance,' there is little to none in this story in the popular definition of historical romance novels. There is little history, either. Instead, the author uses the second half of the novel to 'prove' the stories of the bible are literal and true, one after another, in quick succession. And the heroine is pivotal to all of them. If the aim was to promote spirituality and pseudo-history, the author should have been a bit less devious about luring unsuspecting readers with this tripe.When the heroine is finally reunited with her husband, we discover they have no chemistry. If they do, it certainly isn't evident in the narrative. Don't bother with this one."
2,My Least Favorite of the Series,"When I finally was able to find a copy of this final installment of the series, I was so excited to read it. I re-read the first three to refresh my memory with the comings and goings of our friends Chole and Cheftu. Imagine my disappointment to have to say how much I hated this book. There was almost no interaction between Chole and Cheftu, no clear explanation of how we got there or where we are going, and a really dumb story line. Ms. Frank also forgot to continue with some outstanding issues from the prior novels....like with the character Dion and a certain elixir? The only reason why I read the whole thing was to see how Ms. Frank was going to end her series. Since I'm not the kind of person who would post spoilers, let me just sum up by saying this: Big Disappointment."
1,Sunrise on the Mediterranean,"When I finished Reflections on the Nile I did not know there were more as I never searched for them. I LOVED THE FIRST ONE, so-so the 2nd one . THE THIRD ONE I JUST FINISHED ABOUT 1 /2 HR. WAS HORRIBLE! So I'm on line to see what they say about the 3rd one.Doesn't make me want to buy it.! Not enough between the 2 main characters and too much so called history.It's too much in the TWILIGHT ZONE. My favorite author is DIANA GABALDON. HER NOVELS MAKE SENSE AND ARE MORE DOWN TO EARTH AND BELIEVABLE."
3,Weak latch,"The 15-foot cable completely fills the recessed spool space when wrapped carefully and tightly. This means that if you aren't careful to get the turns of cable tight against each other, you'll end up with more cable than will fit when you latch. The red latch broke and fell off. I am now using a wrap of double-sided Velcro tape in a figure-8 arrangement. This cable lock is a good idea, but the latch should be improved and more space should be provided for wrapping the cable without being so meticulous."
3,Would have liked it more.,"I would have given this 3 and a half stars but to me this is the weakest of the Berlin trilogy. It is to me a collection of songs and frankly some of them are not that strong. LowLowand ""Heroes""Heroesare just better all the way through. Yes I am an Eno fan so take this review with a grain of salt! I do love Scary MonstersScary Monsterstho."
3,Talking Heads loomed large!,"Brian Eno had just produced Talking Heads, and Bowie the musical magpie heard an opportunity and was looking to the future. Lodger is the result, and is a mixed blessing. Not one of my favorites, and if Eno had been on board for Station to Station and that wonderful album recorded in Berlin, Lodger would be in a category of its own rather than being the last and somewhat anomalous chapter of the so-called Berlin Trilogy. Call it what you may, this is a minor entry in the Bowie catalog. He was back on track with Scary Monsters in 1980."
4,funky world music (before there was world music),Bowie returns to melody and narrative for this funky excursion into exotic musical forms.Many of the songs describe wanderers--perhaps a metaphor for Bowie's philosophical wanderings?
3,Complex but incohesive,"This is my least favorite of Bowie's trilogy of albums produced by Brian Eno. It lacks the innovation and freshness of Low, and there are no truly spectacular songs like the title track from Heroes. Perhaps it is that I find the music somewhat clinical and devoid of emotion, but I experience this album as very fragmentary. While not bland, the musical textures and moods are aloof and have an unfinished feel about them. To me, Boys Keep Swinging and Fantastic Voyage are the only memorable songs and `Boys' had a fantastic video clip. The song DJ comments on the disco era in a set of vivid images and the various experiments in rhythm are noteworthy. I'm awarding it 3 stars for its obvious intelligence, but my personal enjoyment of it is limited."
2,Pop Goes The Concept,"The ""Berlin"" trilogy - and David Bowie's collaboration with Brian Eno - was a penniless and weary traveler by the time of this May 1979 release.Gone was the experimental edginess and creative power of Low and Heroes, which was replaced by a bland pop framework. Only the excellent Red Money dares to venture into a unique soundscape.The first single - Boys Keep Swinging - is as bland as DJ - the follow-up 45 rpm - is energetic. The solid Look Back In Anger remains a Bowie gem that gets lost in the shuffle of his vast discography.This was grand potential probably lost by a lack of new studio ideas and boredom. Too bad the rent came due much too soon for Bowieno."
2,Will disappoint most listeners,"Lodger was a stumble for Bowie after the incredibly well written and performed music of Station to Station, Low, and Heroes. A small group of fans see brilliance in the mess, but other than DJ and African Night Flight, most of the CD deserves gathering dust."
4,Fun and fairly good.,"Lodger is far more uplifting than it's precessors Low and ""Heroes"", and toys with worldly influences instead of with dark and broody instrumentals. Those influences work well, though it's no Graceland. At times the album doesn't sound as inspired as Low and most of ""Heroes"" does, and it lacks real standout tracks, but as a whole it's a very fun and fairly good album. Worth listening to any day."
4,An under-rated gem...,"I like this album a lot. No, it's not a ""Low"" or a ""Scary Monsters"", but it's still darn good. Unfortunately, this album is often forgotten when people talk about Bowie's fantastic 70's. The album has two halves (sides), the first one is so-so, and most of the songs are annoying, although ""Red Sails"" is growing on me. Then something wonderful happens. One a row, we get ""DJ"", ""Look back in anger"", ""Boys Keep Swinging"", and ""Reptetion"", all stellar tracks displaying Bowie at his best! I particularly like ""Boys Keep Swinging"", one of my all time Bowie favorites, and the dark, cynical ""Repetition"" gets better every time you listen to it.My only complaint is that the album is fairly short. It clocks in at merely 35 min, but then again, the last 18 min alone are worth the price of the CD! Bonus points for the creative (and disturbing?) album art! :)"
4,Mr.Chameleon,"aka Ziggy,Aladdin Sane, Thin White Duke He has many different M O's When I heard some FM airplay from Lodger DJ, Look Back In Anger,& Yassasin Only then did I purchase Lodger.He had Flashes of greatness after the Pin-Ups with Diamond Dogs,Rebel Rebel,Station to Station, & TVC15. But he never returned to that total kick ass rocking out songs.Lodger put together some real interesting material.But when has he ever put out songs that made perfect sense? Just listen and enjoy."
2,BACH VIA VILLA-LOBOS,"You will find plenty of rhythmic sweep in these colorful orchestral syntheses of Villa-Lobos, occasionally a pleasing melodic line (as in the ""Preludios"" of the Bachianas Brasileiras No.'s 2 and 4) or a spikey phrase, but more often than not these works seem rather redundant, uninspired and bombastic, as much of this composer's music is. Some, frankly, may find little depth amongst these grandiose symphonic outpourings of supposed Brazilian ""heart."" Perhaps this is the earmark of Villa-Lobos' style, and what is innately tiresome. Too much ""matter"" with inconsequential substance; in other words, simple Brazilian musical dance idioms enlarged to complex orchestral forms--- for the sake of show. For those of you who warm to him, however, this CD offers fine sound and a generous length.[Running time: 70:04]"
4,Handy gadget,"Very handy gadget for making perfecty shaped omelets and stove-top fritatas. Sturdy, with convenient handle and cover. I use a glass cover instead so that I can watch the food cook."
1,Not as advertised,"The item I received was used.The egg ring was out of shape-not round,so the lid doesn't fit.The lid was dented and not made of Stainless-it is aluminum.Total disappointment and waste of money.I will never purchase from Next Day Gourmet L.P. again."
5,Straight to the Point,The discussions were clear and the sample problems hit the bull's eye. I recommend this book to be included in the school library.
1,Vague and unhelpful,"This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever bought. At least it's complete at over 1000 pages. The example problems, the heart of a text on engineering, leave MUCH to be desired. More than once the authors have decided to reveal new, and consequently unexplained concepts in the first problems at the chapter's end. That coupled with the fact that the instructor's solution manual contains few actual solutions is unforgivable. Repeatedly I've been forced to guess or assume reasons for the existance of certain calculations. Rarely do the authors explain their reasoning for doing certain things and if they do explain something it's not easily understandable from the text. I wouldn't recommend this text to anyone! If you're thinking about getting this book as a desk reference don't waste your money!"
4,"Get the vinyl 12"" instead","Everything on this disc is great, but it's missing several excellent mixes that were on the original vinyl 12"". Why stupid record companies can't put an entire EP on a CD is beyond me. But if you can't find the vinyl on eBay, this gets 4 stars as a second best option. The B-side is among the top 25% of Erasure's B-sides, and the mixes here definitely add something beyond the album track."
4,Better tha n the original public release single!,The remix of a little respect(long version)is awesome! Vince Clarke gets a little more creative and complex on this outing.A memorable recording!
3,Jungle Beats,"Three minute congo drum instrumentals do not put me in a ""Blissed Out Mood"", but they may for someone else. This is more for a Portishead fan who likes heavy beats and drums over anything else. If you lean toward rap, drum & bass, enjoy Nightmares On Wax's newer sound over the old, and need to relax, check this out. It's a good compillation (not mixed), with artists who I usually like (Alex Gopher, Thievery Corp, Tim Love Lee, Truby Trio, etc.) but it's like taking all my least favorites and making a double CD out of them. At the same time, if you're into melancholy vocals, and African beat meets trip hop, this is the place."
1,Eat the photographs!,"Beautiful photos. Absolutely terrible recipes for dim sum. I tried making several of the items in this book, more than once. Each time I repeated a recipe, I tried to add more flavor, but I finally gave up. These recipes produced the most bland, tasteless, forgettable dim sum I have ever made. I agree with another reviewer. Search out Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's, The Dim Sum Dumpling Book, or Rhoda Yee's, Dim Sum. Both books have recipes which will produce dim sum worthy of eating."
2,Very Poor,"There is almost nothing to commend this book. There are only 40 recipes (excluding the 7 recipes for dipping sauces) and none of them are very good in my opinion. There are illustrations for each recipe, which is usually a plus, but in this case even the pictures were not very appetizing for the most part. I found very little in the book that looked much like anything one would find at a dim sum restaurant and there are too many recipes which recommend store bought won-ton wrappers even for steamed items. Quite frankly, it strikes me that the author has perused a few cookery books and thrown together this production without any real understanding of, or expertise in this particular style of cuisine."
4,dim sum,I was looking for a complete book on dim sum food because my daughter is such a big fan. We found almost all of the foods she loves to snack on except one so our search continues but we are enjoying the book and all it offers - yum!
3,Not recommended,"This is old-school nude dancing (not so much stripping as we know it today--not as much exposure, no monolithic pole and not a whole lot of actual disrobing). Most of the girls are natural (good) but not especially attractive (bad). It's REALLY hard to tell one from another. They're also entirely anonymous, which makes me wonder what they're doing today and if their children (or grandchildren) know that they were in this production. Also something about this feels very European; hard to say for sure because it has basically zero details and it's clearly from a videotape master. So don't expect much in the way of image quality."
2,Tempos are far too fast,"The sound and playing are fine, but the tempos are so fast that it sounds as if the conductor's on speed. The fast tempos completely miss the beauty of the pieces. Extremely disappointing. Unless you're a speed freak, avoid."
3,Muddled by pseudo-authenticity,"3 1/2This version does sound a little underwhelming for such an immortal piece, though the authentic instrumentation does have its limited perks. Newbies wouldn't notice the difference, completists pick apart pros and cons, but the rest of us should settle for better definitive recordings."
3,audience Analysis by Denis McQuail,"mass communication reseach, how to know the effect of mass communication, and how about advertising. what is relation betwen advertising and marketing communication"
3,I felt good about buying this book,"I think it's a good idea to give some of hte money to horse charaty. I hate abuse, and the thing I realy liked about this book was the emphasis on treating your horse kindly and thinking from his point of view."
4,Embroidered Truths- Monica Ferris,"I really enjoy the Betsy Devonshire mysteries, and this one is no exception, but it does fall a little short of the other books in the series. While we get to know a great deal more about Godwin and his relationship with John, there seems to be more description of setting than actual plot development. And to be perfectly honest, Ms Ferris almost gives it away about 2/3 of the way through. The character development was good, and there were a few surprises scattered throughout the book, but they seemed to distract from the story line.A good read, but not one of my favorites by this author"
3,nice compact version of her first novels,"moncia FERRIS HAS CREATED SOME ENDEARING CHARACTERS. i have read the entire series and they are all quite good and fit the american ""cozy murder"" genre nicely. if you are looking for some nice quick summer or winter reads these are great.however, in the grand scheme of cozy murders, there are a flood of them on the market, so if you are not interested in needlework this might not be to your taste."
5,"Beautiful, simply beatiful","The story line is wonderful. It has a few things that aren't noticed normally in the first view (watch the final battle scene a few times and you'll see some very well made thing) The best thing is, unlike other movies, you don't have to see the first two (Legend of the hungry wolf and a new battle [I think]) to understand what there characters have gone though (but it does help)"
5,The DVD blows the VHS totally out of the water,"I bought the VHS of this movie a long time ago and loved it. I loved it so much that I watched it about 50 times. I knew everything about the quality of the tape from when the audio screwed up to when certain parts were going to be fuzzy. When I bought the DVD I watched it and nothing, not one speck of fuzz was to be found, the sound totally blew me away too, way better than VHS. There are also a lot of extras on the disk that I liked too. Such things as Theatrical Trailers both in English and Japanese along with drawings, a backstory feature, and a lot of information about Viz including additonal trailers from other Viz Video offerings(a lot of them) made this disk well worth it's money. Words cannot explain the quality of both the video and the audio in this DVD. Amazon.com has the best price I've seen for this DVD anywhere on the internet. Don't miss out on it!"
5,They fought and never look back,"Fatal Fury the movie is one of a kind anime mix with a video game. Street Fighter is still the other anime that I like because bringing the favor into the character is wonderful. Terry is the calm, street fighter, Andy is stressed out because of Mai, Joe acts like a bonehead and Mai is a bit pighead sucking up to Andy to protect her. When one of the pieces of ""Armor of Mars"" was founded by ""Laocorn"" he plans to use all six pieces to become a god. Not only that his twin sister Sulia asked Terry to help her brother to be free of the cruse. Terry and his team went on to find the armor to prevent Laocorn to be controled by the armor. Fatal Fury action, drama,and some comedy to impress the fans. Special apperances by Kim Kapwhan, Duck King, Billy Kane and others from FF2. What makes also makes this movie special is the song ""Oh Angel"" at the credits. sounds romatic."
4,Fatal Fury-Motion Picture VHS,"This movie was very exciting! It really had something for all anime lovers I found. It had a lot of fighting, but it had a touch of romance to it at the same time. The plot was yet another anime plot where you stop and think, ""How in the world did they come up with something like that?"" because the plot was very original. I liked this movie very much. It wasn't one of the best but I'm a person who likes almost every anime she watches. :)"
3,Nothing new here,"Ok, it's a fighting movie with a standard plot (guy looking for item to make him god-like). The scenes changed a little quickly, and didn't really seem connected. The battles were reminiscient of the Dragon Ball Z, with super-characters blasting each other and leveling buildings and whatnot. Lots of energy beams flying around. Wow. In the movie's favor, the animation was good and the orchestral music was EXCELLENT. Still, the action scenes were all the same and the plot certainly didn't hold it together. Check out Street Fighter II instead."
3,american otaku's thoughts,"once again i am dissapointed. as an otaku i am sure you know the legend of all fighting game animes'. they suck. this one was no exception. the only thing giving it an average review was the animtion. sadly this is the best fighting game anime out there so in the fighting genere it gets a 5 ,but in the anime genere it gets a 3. if for some reason you liked this check out toshinden and gowcaiser(fanservice city)."
2,Headache Music,"This 7 track album from this band would have been much better without the overbearing electric steel guitar, which carries the same riffs throughout the album and basically drowns out the whiney, coked-out vocals altogether. Tracks 1-3 and 5 are seriously overtoned and offbeat, much like a junior high school garage band needing much practice.Advise: Send the Steel to the back of the bus and tone it down...ALLOT, get in sync, put some emotion and emphasis on the vocals, then you should be just fine.Track Listing:1) Eating Her Eyes2) Colder3) Nothing's Beautiful4) Giving My Head To Her5) All Discussions End6) She Stops The Clocks7) Postscript: Landscape With Car Crash"
5,Jimmy rules,allright i love jimmy eat world so of course this cd rules and sweetness is my favorite song it just makes me sing at the top of my lungs!!
4,Quite a good card.,"Though I've had some troubles with finicky drivers, this TV/FM tuner card is quite worth the money. The program it comes with, QuickTV, generally works quite well. The remote works pretty good too, though it doesn't seem to work with anything other than this company's own software, which rather annoys me."
4,Great TV card for the price,"Pretty neat card for the price. Installation and setup was a breeze in my home-built PC w/analog cable. Video quality is on the low end on most channels (about what a REALLY good air-wave reception looks like). Sound setup was a little quirky (went through the Modem somehow (???)). Software interface is a little ""grade-school""-ish, but still usable and user-friendly. Everything else is awesome. Love the fact that the remote boots up the program rather than pointing and clicking. Still an excellent card for the money."
2,Great Card if it Works,"The drivers that ship with the card are fine for XP, but do not work with Vista. The KWorld site barely works half the time, making it hard to get your hands on the drivers. The software overall is horrible, and the card is not recognized by windows media center."
4,Installing the Terminator Pci Tv Tuner,After the third attempt I was finally able to install and operate the above mentioned device. Installation proceedures were a little vague and somewhat complicated. This device will not operate in some PC's. Guidelines laid down by the Mfg. have to be followed very closely.The device works quite well and I recommend it for any one who is looking to record Tv shows and Fm. Philip E. Kriner
1,No rebate from KWorld,KWorld refused to honor their rebates. Don't purchase any of their products if you expect a rebate. This is the first time I have ever been refused a rebate. They said I didn't send the receipt but I did and had copies of everything I sent. There are other forums on the internet that talk about how KWorld does not honor their own rebates. Very bad mark for KWorld.
4,"good card, dodgy remote","The card works well enough, and the picture quality is good with cable input. I only give it 4 stars due to the iffy nature of the remote. I might have to experiment with placement of the pickup, but the remote response is inconsistent, requiring multiple retries before it recognizes any input.Good value for the price."
1,No Hardware Decoder,"There is no hardware encoder on this card. That means even on the lowest setting, poorest quality, least processor intensive software encoding, the audio will fall behind the video. Also tried using Virtual VCR which tries to correct this on these types of cards, and after about 30min on the lowest setting the audio will again fall behind the video. The minimum requirements for this card should be about a 4-5Ghz processor."
3,10blazin ebay underground tapes seller,"yeah this album is ok it has the underground tapes style to it there older release is better tho 28 grams o dope but is qwite hard to find but this is definatly worth checking out ,,,,,,"
4,great reading,"This book appears to have all info necessary for keeping lovebirds. It was an enjoyable read, an easy read and not boring, the author knew what he was talking about."
1,No Way,Cute pictures and thats all. Bad info...says you shouldn't have a single lovebird! Thats ubsurd. I have one sitting on my shoulder right now and shes definately happy. It is true you have to spend a lot of time with a single lovie but I know its possible!!
4,A little bit extra,This is my 2nd actual hard copy book on love birds. My other reads have been from internet sources. Overall the book covered what I wanted to know and a little bit more. Gave me a lot to think about before purchasing a parrot.
3,"OK for beginners - mediocre, at best, for artists!","I would recommend this book for beginners only! The special effects, referred to in the title, are basic watercolor techniques. The book itself is not very creative in format, content nor presentation ."
1,LOW AS LOW CAN BE!,It must be groups like the ACLU that allow this type of junk to be marketed as decent people would never allow this filth on the radio or in their homes. Avoid this CD as you would any other one by this group.
5,The best!,The reviews here are spot on. Beautiful design...the weight makes opening wine bottles and snapping off bottle tops a breeze. Very well made...I've been using this for five years and it still works like new.
3,"All frosting, no cake","Gorgeously sung, arranged and produced album, particularly for a (presumably?) low-budget item. But it's all surface beauty, without much else to recommend it. And awfully plodding -- pick up the pace, kids! ""The Middle"" is catchy, but memorable songwriting is in short supply here. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the band goes onto greater success. A larger label could grab them, add some marketing juice and park them in the Barnes & Noble top-seller racks."
4,memories,"I got this CD when it first came out, and its as nice as I remember. The quality of the CD was great and I could tell it was well taken care of. Great job. I took a little longer than I thought to come in, but hey, at least I was able to find the CD."
5,Sludge Metal,"This is metal slowly brewed to a thick and sludgy perfection. Kyuss are at the top of their game with this first rate metal record. This is heavy metal done Black Sabbath style, slow and heavy and very hard. The boys also show their gift for psychedelic instrumentals, most notable on Asteroid. Imagine a stoner metal version of Miles Davis's Bitches Brew and your almost there. Most people these days will listen to this record due to the fact that the now popular Queens of the Stone Age has found an audience. Kyuss was Josh Homme's(the Queen's leadsinger and guitarist)first notable band in which he had all guitar duties while John Garcia handled vocals. I personally prefer Homme's classy vocals to Garcia's typical heavy metal growl but with a fine record like this, thats only a minor flaw. Anyways if you love your metal slow and heavy and swirling with a psychedelic sheen than this is a must own."
4,The desert experience,"Kyuss' third album is a bit lighter and more meditative than their masterpiece ""Blues for the Red Sun"". This also means that in many occasions there is plenty of room and attention for melodies, not that ""Blues..."" was lacking any. The album structure of dividing the record into three parts allows the songs to grow longer in actual length and is not limiting the music within the traditional song structures. Highly recdommended."
3,"3,5 stars",I have listened to their previous albums and i didnt like them at all. This is the first album that i almost like for them. The melodies and riffs are good and they play something like Black Sabbath and Spiritual Beggars. The sound is old (the production reminds me of older groups in the 80s. This is not definitely bad as with the music they play it suits them. Im betwwen its just ok and i like it. A nice effort.
5,Stoner Rock Essential,"Excellent album by one of the best bands from the '90's you probably never heard of. Great concept for an album, 12 songs or something on 3 tracks with a bonus track. Heavy and beautiful"
3,Imaginative boogie woogie,Whilst I agree with all other reviews that this is indeed a fine recording I prefer to retain a sense of historical perspective and balance with my score. To my mind a 5 star score should only go to a true landmark disc - and Sky Valley just aint - sorry. To my ears the vocals are a big distraction and the derivative boogie woogie rolling stones metallica influences disguise and confuse the band's creative voice. Magical guitar playing. (Has the Adelaide reviewer ever been graced to see The Plague play live? - find out about them)
3,better than previous album,"Verges on 2 star. This is the finest work of a mediocre, generic rock band."
2,"Great music, not so great vocals and lyrics.","Let's be realistic here this is not a 5, 4, or 3 star album. The music is awesome and then the dude starts singing and you're like ahhh man, bummer. No doubt Josh Homme is an excellent and creative guitar player and the rest of the music is sweet but the singing can only be described as 80's butt rock style as well as the lyrics, sorry man. QOTSA fans this is not for you."
3,its good not great,the song demon cleaner is great.tool knew it thats why they covered that one.as far as the rest of the cd its good ;but nothing to name a new type of music after(stoned desert rock)or whatever.the vocals sound like a cross of motorheads and soundgarden.the music sounds like A.I.C. except less heroin and more shrooms.demon cleaner is a must have so if you dont buy the cd just find a mp3 of either tool or kyuss version they are both great!
1,Sub Par,"A set singularly lacking in imagination or originality coupled with mediocre production. Even the cover art, by the late Marc Rude, is below his usually high standards."
1,not good!,the songs and riffs are terrible and horrible! i can imagine life without this album! i hate this band!
5,Dominating,"This is music. I've heard people compare Kyuss to so many other bands, mainly Sabbath, but Kyuss is simply Kyuss. This albumn is Kyuss's best. Each of its three tracks works beautifully and should be listened to all at once. The music isn't easy listening. I don't put it on when I want to relax or while I'm doing something else. The music is its own thing. Just ignore meanings of the lyrics and breathe in the music, cause its better than mostly anything your going to hear.This music is bass filled and its whether its arranged or just a jam, the timing and beauty is always on the spot. Brant Bjork is amazing at what he does, writing and drumming and it shows. A lot of people knock God Garcia's singing, but he fits in so perfectly over the droning sound. If one puts aside the notion this band is like 500000 others and just listens to it in peace, there is an infinite amount to appreciate."
5,Sky valley is the greatest album i've ever heard!,"Kyuss was going to be the greatest rock band on the planet,and when sky valley was released they were,unfortunetly they broke up in 1995.Sky valley is the greatest underground rock album of all time!"
2,Mediocre for the price ($14.95),I assumed for the high price these would be a sturdy and easily reusable set of diffusion sheets. What i got was some very flimsy diffusion paper that were all poorly hand cut. For the price you are better off buying cheap diffusion paper and cutting it yourself.
1,too small,"i should have read the description more carefully, but i was suprised at how small it was- too small for me to write and read any addresses so I will not using this."
3,bowls are inexpensive for a reason,"The bowls are nice paper bowls, but I had two issues with the product.One, the bowls are hard to separate from each other, like really hard, and I got frequent paper cuts trying to do so. Sometimes the bowls would get bent up or ripped in trying to separate the bowls. I hated that.Two, the bowls don't do so well with liquids, especially hot liquids. Hot soups start soaking into the bowls pretty quick. Milk and cereal soak in after 5 or 10 minutes, but it isn't such a big deal because I don't let my cereal get soggy. At least we know the bowls ARE biodegradable and better for the earth.If you are using the bowls for things such as ice cream, fruit, candy, craft items, etc, the bowls are great. They actually did remarkably well for holding house paint, no sog.So, bottom line. The bowls are a very economical good buy if you intend to use the bowls for solid items or thick liquids and take the time to wear gloves and separate the bowls out beforehand."
4,Good for people who know how to read music,"Basically, if you know how to read music it will be good for you. I learned how the play the guitar on my own, but I have previously learned how to play piano, violin, and viola with an instructor (and I played in the school orchestra). It has tabs, chords, and musical notes for the different guitar parts along with the musical notes for the vocal parts. I love it!"
1,You got to be kidding me...,The information in this book is basic. I could feel my romance IQ dropping as I thumbed through.
1,This is a complete false interpretation of my Father's work,"My Father William J. Coughlin, who died at the early age of 62, did not write this book. Although the publisher wants you to believe he wrote and finished this book on his death bed. This is completely untrue. The rights were sold by a family member to the publisher and another writer from the west coast was hired to write this. My father had a great idea regarding a story he wanted to write, but there is not one parargraph in this entire book that my Father wrote.The publisher is just trying to sell you on the name and his success from his previous novels.If you would like to read a couple of very good books William J. Coughlin did write: Try ""Shadow of a Doubt"" or : ""Death Penalty"""
2,"Slow, slow, slow","I expected a true thriller. Scott Turow had said ""Vintage Coughlin. Sharp, tight and full of suspense."" I found this book to be none of these. It took forever to get started and once it got going the outcome was predictable and offered no suspense."
4,Like reading two books at once.,"Despite some creepy and very graphic scenes, I enjoyed this book. I have to admit, however, that I suspected the murderer from pretty early on. I did not, however, suspect the story that unfolded in the last couple of pages.There were really two story lines running concurrently, with no connection other than Sloan. This format wasn't distracting, just a bit hard to reconcile once in a while - like reading two books at once.After reading the comments by Mr. Coughlin's son on this site, I will go find some of the books he really wrote and check those out."
1,Poor quality. Could be better.,"I was in the market for a webcam that can clip on my laptop. Well needless to say I am still in the market for one because this was terrible product. Dark pictures were only the start of it. When used as a webcam the fps rate seemed very low and the picture quality was just bad, color saturation and resolution. The included software could've been better too."
5,High quality switch plate,This switch plate is much higher quality than others I've seen...it's probably twice the thickness of other plates and the finish is excellent.
4,A Quality Work,"While the language of Lattimore's translation hardly compares with the soaring language he uses in his later version of ""Prometheus Bound,"" this is still an extremely quality edition of Aeschylus' only remaining trilogy. The poetry is crisp and far less obtuse than the unreadable Paul Roche translation, and of course Aeschylus' depiction of human nature,especially in the strained relationship between Agamemnon and his wife Clytemnestra, is always of timeless interest. On balance, a fair treatment of a Greek classic."
1,bad translation,"Lattimore, in his inept poetic exuberance, often loses the sense of a line and confuses the reader. Aeschylus is so powerful he can't be diminished entirely, but where is the modern translation we need? Lattimore published this in 1953, and says in his introduction that he changed little from a 1926 translation. Does anyone know of a better, more recent translation?"
4,Tragedy's Daddy,Aeschylus' trilogy is very enjoyable reading. It would be fun to see these plays performed. It's too bad that so many of Aeschylus' plays did not survive. The only reason this is not a 5 star rating is that the translation was awkward in just a few places. 4.5 stars is probably the correct rating.
5,a 21st century Apollo?,"Indeed! How much I would pay for the chance to play under Mr. Ruske! His technique is supreme, his sound god-like, and his musical understanding of the unique beauty of Mozart make this recording one of the greatest treasures of the classical world. Highly recommended to anyone with an ear for beauty and excellence; an absolute MUST for any and every student or performer of the French horn!"
1,Don't waste your time,"The interpretations of Ruske are elementary at best. This is the worst rendition of Mozart i have ever heard. Ruske should listen to Dennis Brain because ""It doesn't get any better than this!"""
4,"Begining Gymnasts, You Will Love This Book","This is a verry good book for gymnasts who are just getting started in the sport or for kids who want to learn a few skills. There are lots of delightfull, colorfull pictures."
3,there are other option in the market,mmmmmmmm is not too goodi think there are a lot of option better than this to buy
4,Le Train Musical,Le Train Musical is a two disc re-issue set that features the long unavailable first album by World Standard as well as previously unreleased tracks. World Standard is Soichiro Suzuki and producer Haroumi Hosono of YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra.)
2,Disappointed,"This video is of the most basic of methods for working a horse in the round pen. If you know much about horses at all, you will not learn much. The video shows horses that are already trained-it does not show how Smokie got to that stage with the horse or even why you would want to do this with a horse (in other words, where do you go from here). It is a general overview of basic round pen work, but nothing here for serious trainers."
4,See What You Didn't See,"This is a very well presented DVD. What you get are mini-versions of the episodes from Season 1 of the reality show THE BACHELOR.Added bonuses included previously unseen material This is good stuff. What you get to see are the things you want to see. More of the romance, more of the drama, more of the potential sex, more of the fun. There's also more of Amanda- a definite good thing in my book. If you're a fan of the show I recommend this DVD, and if you're not, you may find yourself fascinated by the exploits and becoming a fan yourself."
3,A Knee Slapper,"I enjoyed the DVD of ""The Bachelor, Season 1,"" it was a complete hoot, and my daughter and I both thought it was a comedic delight. What a send-up of American dating rituals! Thanks for that. And the DVD was in fine condition too, because God knows we wouldn't have wanted to miss a moment of the comedy, which many times bordered on farce. A brilliant satire on the American habit of putting a price tag on everything, including moonlight!"
1,I won't be happy...,"...until Fleiss and company release a DVD of The Bachelorette II, that featured Meredith Phillips. Her romance with Ian was the most beautiful, satisfying, and real romances of any in this series. Unfortunately, the editing of Meredith's series did it's best to lead one to believe that she'd pick (snore) Matthew. Mr. Fleiss, we want an unedited version of M&I's romance! With lots of out-takes! Then I'll be happy to give you 5 stars!"
3,Good for Basics,"This is a decent book for beginners. But anyone who is truly serious about Irish music who still thinks that Danny Boy is an Irish song needs to do more research.Sorry to sound like a snob but songs like Danny Boy, When Irish Eyes are Smiling, Mother McCree and the like are Irish American and third generation at best. True research on genuine Irish music means going back to the earlier Irish resources and finding out what the original songs in the Irish sound like.It's a good place to start but don't expect folk from Ireland to take you seriously as a musician if your entire repertoire comes from books like this."
5,Super Comprehensive,This book covers everything. I have to agree with 90 percent of the advice given. The authors are clever and humerous with more than a few enlightening insights. Witty jabs left me wondering if they knew me better than I did. Comprehensive without being a bore.
3,A little over the top especially for this economy,"I found this book to be a little over the top in that it is more about the ""show"" than about substance. If you want to know how to act like a gentleman, then I would recommend the Emily Post Etiquette book. I do think you can get some ideas from the book but in the economic state that we are currently in, I believe that frugality is in. By this I mean that women are more likely the simple gesture of holding a door open rather than the fact that you have a really nice flask which you carry around at formal events."
5,Making it HOT for the gentlemen!!!,"I toted along the MG for entertainment on my flight to Boston this weekend, and WAS I ENTERTAINED!!! The MG rolls along sweetly, settling into a simmer, before it boils over in hilarious fervor. You have made it HOT for the people, indeed.Nice touch. Including a reference to not only Quato, but also Geoff Edwards. And I believe you exhibited class in the one punch that was pulled in the entire fight. To wit: the Zevitas reference was Ms. rather than Mrs.A beautiful piece of work, which has made the world a better place."
1,Overinflated twaddle,"This is the first (and hopefully only) book I have ever returned to the bookseller for an immediate refund. Most of this blather is overheated and bombastic. Most citations could be stated more clearly and simply, but instead the authors opt for pop cutesiness and hyperclever, convoluted language. A much better (and far more useful) volume is Peter Post's ESSENTIAL MANNERS FOR MEN. Now there's a guy who knows what it takes to be a gentleman .... and not a sham."
1,Miserable book!!!,"This was the most miserable book that I have ever read!!! It makes absolutely no sense and can not be applied in real relationships. Obviously, these authors have no concept of the meaning of a true gentelman. Please don't buy this book - it is a waste of your money!!!"
3,This thing about a Windsor knot...,"Well written, perhaps a bit juvenile, but over all a fine book for it makes the important distinction between FORM and CONTENT, that is, it is a man's content that makes him a gentleman and not anything external. Their insistence on a Windsor knot is puzzling however. The savvy gentleman would know that the knot one uses is dependent upon mostly the necktie itself, taking into consideration the shirt collar and and body proportions. See THE 85 WAYS TO TIE A TIE, which is still available at Amazon UK, for more."
5,"Entertainment Weekly, right on!","So, I love EW and I read it religiously with my coffee and lunch every Friday when it comes out. I just finished reading ""The Book You Have To Read"" section, Augusten Burroughs (""Running with Scissors"", super cool NYC author), writes about Phineas Mollod and Jason Tesauro's book, ""The Modern Gentleman."" I have had this book for a few months and I can say that Augusten speaks the truth. It's a great guide to living to the fullest extent at this day and age; they cover everything - dating, music, literature, fashion, fetish, alcohol, etc. Every fiction book they mention that I have read and every overlooked liqueur they recommend that I have tasted, I have loved; dating tips and dinner party table arranging (entertaining) are top of the line; and hell, I even used their Theorem de Valise and learned how to pack a perfect suitcase - I can't believe they figured that out but it works and it's great. So, just want to drive the point home - get this book!"
2,"Modern, But Instructive?","If you are interested in learning the art of pomposity and/or how to bore your mate with select drivel, this is your ultimate guide. If however, you possess a mid to high level IQ and are truly interested in becoming a gentleman, than a little something like sincerity and sensitivity will take you much further than the self congratulatory filler found in The Modern Gentleman. Ultimately, the text is well written and playfully mimicks etiquette books of yore, but with superficial and superciliious as its anchors, it just floats."
2,disappointed,This book was more humor than sage advice. I'd say only 10% was useful. The rest was just humorous quips from the authors. Example: the advice to blame flatulence on the nearest pet. Is this really the mark of a gentleman? The problem is that you already have to BE a gentleman to separate the good advice from the humor. Pick another book.
1,Pomp and Circumstance,"The writing of this book is analogous to its value. It seems as though a thesaurous and a rhyming dictionary were always at hand in an attempt to bluff one's way into dispensing advice. Although the authors seem to have found a demand for said advice, the soundness of that advice is questionable. As others have said, this book might provide some entertainment, perhaps as bathroom reading material. In essence, however, ""The Modern Gentleman"" is a misnomer. The authors do not lead others on the path to gentlemanliness. They simply encourage others to follow in their often eccentric, sometimes immature, and usually pretentious footsteps."
5,So glad I discovered this gem...,"Ordered this volume after reading a great review/interview with the authors in the New York Law Journal. I devoured the whole thing and have proceeded to give copies to several budding gentlemen as graduation gifts. The authors' prolific vocabulary sent me running to the dictionary more than once, but how could that be bad? Great advice on decor, toiletiquette, grooming, food, etc. - especially the cocktail recipes! I hope Messrs. Mollod and Tesauro can find a way to continue their winning formula."
2,"Helpful, but...","There is some helpful advice here on the basics, but nothing that one could not find elsewhere. Additionally, this book leaves one with the impression that the authors are not trying to help young men become gentlemen, but rather how to appear to be gentlemen whilst getting away with behavior that is distinctly ungentlemanly.Because of the unsettling and slightly slimy feeling one gets from reading it, it occurs to me that Eddie Haskell might have been at least an editorial consultant, if not the author."
1,Money Back,This book is overly wordy and a dull commentary on modern life. If you don't already know everything this book has to offer then you haven't left the house much.
1,Bla Bla Bla Bla,No substance at all. The other reviews must have been written by the people who put this thing together.I want my money back!
1,Don't believe the hype,"I got this book as a little joke gift for my boyfriend, and as I was flipping throught it, I came to believe that it should be called ""The Victorian Villain: A Guide to Pompous Verbiage, Snobbishness, and Vice."" There's nothing for gentlemen here, unless by ""gentleman"" you mean ""trust-fund frat boy with no morals and expensive tases"". Dreadful book."
2,"A fun, however ill informing read.","This book is good for 'fluff' reading before you go to bed, as it is mildly humorous, however it provides little practical information. There are a few interesting bits of information, however as a book billed as a guide for 'the modern gentleman,' it unfortunately falls short as it doesn't take itself very seriously. Many of the chapters have suggestions for various drink combinations (actually almost all of them actually) along with the occasional music tip or book to read. I did enjoy the book and was unsure of how many stars to give it - my two star review stems from the lack of practical information the book actually possess."
3,"No surprises, but a worthwhile book","This book was basically what I was expected. There are a lot of good pointers, yet most of them are common sense ideals.There are some useful tips, though, such as which liquors are best for use with a flask. But, for the most part, the information given is what a gentleman would do in the normal course of things.The book is quite comprehensive, covering countless situations in which a gentleman may eventually find himself. The book is well-written and makes for a moderately entertaining read."
2,"Excessively oddball, sarcastic and random","Consider this book more closely related to a work of humor fiction like a zombie survival guide, rather than a practical primer to gentlemanly ways. Heavy on amusing ideas and scenarios for eccentric behavior and vice. The stiff prose is intentionally quirky which makes it something of a pain to read beyond the 20th page.And the dead horse notion of ""Flaskmanship""... Don't get me started on their obsession with flasks.Bottom line - My fundamental complaint of this book is that it misrepresents itself - humor is a great way to teach, but the lack of practical/realistic substance on the subject matter comes across as a bait and switch."
3,"Maybe how to be a modern man, but no gentleman.","While this work does include many interesting tidbits on how to add interesting times to your life, it does a poor job at preparing one for actually being a gentleman. This book assumes that the reader is just a bum, with no morals, looking for a good time. It does very little in preparing one for doing that which is most becoming of a gentleman- actions of righteousness, goodness, and justice."
5,MATT IS HOT!,"I thought, gosh! Matt Damon is one of the hottest guys in the world. No...No...No...Lets make that he's one of the hottest on the top 10 and I think his name on the list would be #1. Matt Damon is also a talented young actor. Saving Private Ryan is coming out in June or July. Check it out!"
3,quick read,"This was a good quick read. But that's mainly due to the fact that every other page is nearly blank and the last half of the book is filmographies. There isn't a lot of new stuff and there are better biographies, but if you're looking for a quick easy read, then this book will do. There's a few small pictures thrown into the middle of book for no reason, but they're okay. The filmographies at the end of the book are probably just an attempt to fill up space, as are the 20 or so little one-sentence facts that take-up one page a piece. If you're looking for a biography with a lot of substance look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a quick easy read then Golden Boy will do. Review by mattdamonfanpage.com."
1,DO NOT READ,"STUPID STUPID BOOK. I have always looked for a good book on Matt Damon that would show me a better side, a new light and this was NOT the book. If you anything else to do, then don't read this book. It could have been a lot better. IF you ask me, it looks like the author put the roughdraft in print and I think the publisher didn't even lok over the book or else it woul NOT have been published."
1,WARNING WARNING STAY AWAY,"THIS IS A BOOK OF NO VALUE. DONT GET ME WRONG, I LOVE MATT DAMON, BUT THIS BOOK JUST DOES NOT DO HIM ANY GOOD. IT IS USELESS AND YOU SHOULD GO READ A BETTER BOOK, LIKE ASIMOV'S ""FOUNDATION'S EDGE"""
1,IF YOU ARE TRULY A MATT DAMON FAN<DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book was compiled of mostly useless little tidbits, that I already knew. If you don't know ANYTHING about matt damon and want to then go ahead and read, otherwise DO NOT waste your time. I feel sorry if you already have and I understand how you must feel. I also think the author should have just donw more research, there is a lot of info out there."
1,DO NOT READ,"IT IS SIMPLY A WASTE OF TIME. I WAS LOOKING FOR A BOOK THAT LET ME REALLY LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT MATT DAMON, THIS WAS NOT IT. I HAVE LOOKED FOR THAT BOOK AND I AM STILL LOOKING, SO IF YOU FIND ONE, TELL ME. THANK YOU"
4,REALLY LIFE WAR DRAMA,"When I first saw the book I taught that the book was going tobe about guns and how to kill your enemy in a war. I was totallywrong because this book was more about making good judgment. In this book Mr. Slate is a Marine soldier who talks about his experience threw the Vietnam, China, and Korean war. The book starts out by gigvng the reader a over view on the territories that the Marines fought in. Sergant Jessie Slate talks about how many of his good friends die in the line of duty. The book gets really interesting when the writer explains how hard it is to survive in the jungles. The book gets boring and lifless once it starts getting into too many details about the Marine Corp. For example when the author writes about the ranks. Overall the book is a interesting and fun book to read because the reader gets to understand how hard it is to survive in any war. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a interesting Marine book."
4,I love this stuff,It works great but I've been using it for a decade. It cools the eye orbital and shrinks the area. It still leaves the dark circles though. I also would give it 5 stars if it dodn't cost so much. Its also getting harder and harder to find. Nordstom no longer carries it so I'm forced to order online.
3,Well...,"I used a jar of this, and it OK. It is very smoothing and absorbs well, so you can use it under makeup. It didnt help with fine lines or dark circles though. I think this is more of a preventive treatment that you would have to use for a while to see results. I dont think it is worth the price."
1,The Work of a Fraud,"Darn, couldn't get a royal flush this hand... guess I'll have to settle for FOUR ACES!!!Authors who review their own works to jack up the score are unethical lowlifes. I mean, come on, I'm not even allowed to vote ""yes"" that my own review was helpful. Give me a hand people: VOTE YES!!!"
5,Crocodiles,I've always loved the Lovable Lyle books. They address ideas for children that are both humorous and educational. This book was requested by a 3 yr. old for Christmas.
4,Good enough,"Lyle is just so lovable.Unfortunately... not everybody thinks so. Some people are irrationally prejudiced against the idea of living with a crocodile, imagine! He's been getting hate mail. (Oh dear.)Luckily, his charm and heroism save the day (again) and he wins over everybody.This one is a bit wordy - save it for the older end of the 4-8 crowd."
4,Very Interesting Allegory,"This is a great contribution to the Lyle universe, an interesting episode in that wacky, lovable crocodile's life. It is also a terrific commentary on race/ethnic relations in the U.S. What seems to be one woman's random hatred of a reptile and the effects of her animosity (i.e., her daughter becomes a blind hater, too) can be read as an allegory for the difficult negotiations of majority and minority communities in America. Originally published in 1969, this narrative clearly comments on the irrationality of discrimination and serves as a teaching tool for parents looking to guide their children toward a path of tolerance and acceptance. Incredible feat for a simple little book."
5,Hate is a form of fear,"Lyle suffers when he is threatened with hate mail. Overcome with fear himself, Lyle makes matters worse when he hides in a closet. The only solution to Lyle's problem is ""be yourself."" Only then, can Lovable Lyle save the day."
2,A Little Misunderstanding...,"I haven't read this book in years, but I have a very vivid memory from it. I read it when I was in first grade, and I guess I didn't really figure out the moral of the story, because I proceeded to write a vicious little hate letter to my next-door neighbor. I don't think I knew what I was doing, and I was very, very ashamed of myself when it was discovered.So, if you do buy this, just make sure your kids get the point."
5,"Beautiful Music, Beautifully Played","I have been a fan of the wonderful pianist John O'Conor since I first heard him live here in St. Louis. It was an unforgettable recital and I bought as many CD's of his that he had out at the time and have continued to add to my collection. Mr. O'Conor has a marvelously lyrical way of phrasing which seems to be almost like singing at times. This CD, Autumn Songs, is a great favorite of mine and I've given it as a present to several of my friends. I am a piano teacher and often play pieces from Mr. O'Conor's oeuvre to show a student how a great pianist would perform. This CD has such beautiful selections, and I especially love Mr. O'Conor's interpretation of ""Duetto"" from Mendelssohn's Song Without Words and ""Warum?"" and ""Romance in F-sharp"" by Schumann. Any music lover will enjoy this gorgeous CD. Give yourself a great gift and buy it."
4,power punkpop,"if you dig Green Day and Sum 41 you'll like see where Slimer come from. This album a killer first 4, then kind of tails off.Sleeve notes describe it as a cross between The Offspring and Beach boys, might be right, but I'm not a big fan of either yet like Slimer a lot. Worth the 4* for overall but coul;d have been a 5 with better pacing on the record, and with maybe one or two tracks off altogether. Still makes up for it all with the stellar intro numbers - great guitars. Top Buy.NYBairn"
5,Good kids book,My mother inlaw had this book in her stack of old books and my son loved it. The book was 30 years old and in bad shape. He loves the book and I was amazed it was still around and got two copies. One for my own home and the other to keep at the inlaws.My son reads it at least once a week. He just loves this book so if you have a young child give it a shot it is a christmas book but its still a good book to read for the moral of the story. For a 2-4 year old age range of kids.
5,Claude the Dog:A Christnas Story,"This is a wonderful book for kids of all ages. It is a Christmas story but emphasizes the saying , ""it is better to give than to receive"". This is a very touching, heartwarming book."
5,an extremely informative and important read..,"For those who want to learn about how diet and one's digestive tract can impact one's overall health then this book is an absolute must. 'Digestive Wellness' does an excellent job explaining all the intricacies of the digestive tract in a very understandable way. We learn about how certain areas can go wrong and lead to a cascade of problems, even chronic illness. The author then recommends a course of action for those suffering from these illnesses. Although the author strongly promotes natural treatments she is not against conventional medications at all. She thinks the two can work together. This book enables one to speak intelligently with one's doctor about potential natural treatments, either on their own or complementary to conventional treatments.Bottom line: I really cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is well worth paying full price for it."
4,Informative Text,"This is a good book if you want to learn all about digestion, the areas of the body involved and how different foods, herbs, and minerals can heal (or destroy) the body. It was interesting to discover how many ailments that are not commonly associated with digestion actually were alleviated or reduced by change in diet and supplementation.I recommend the author consider making the text flow better on a re-write of this text. To me the book was very reference-like. I admit it did state in the beginning that the book was not written to be read from front to back. Nevertheless, I expect books to read this way unless it's specifically labeled as a reference text."
3,Good information,"This book contains good solid information and could absolutely really help improve the health of a lot of people.This book was good, but not as good as the book on this topic by Dr Sherry Rogers which I found far more thorough. That book was excellent and so I would recommend it over this one. If all your library has is this book however, it is well worth a read and makes many important points.Also worth reading are books on the SCD eating plan and the GAPS diet, if you have serious gut issues and dysbiosis and need to heal your gut. These books take a very different and diet-based approach, that may be even more beneficial for some people.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)"
5,A must buy!,"Digestive Wellness is a must read for anyonewho has suffered with digestive difficulties --like I have. Liz explains what's going on insideour guts so that anyone can understand it.And her suggestions for change are practicaland effective. Get this book now.Judith Sherven, Ph.D.co-authorThe Smart Couple's Guide to the Wedding of Your Dreams"
4,Excellent review,"Excellent review of issues related to digestion and how to deal with digestive problems during health and sickness. Certainly worth reading. Readers may also supplement their information by reading these books by digestive disease specialists, Minocha (Natural Stomach Care 2003) and Janowitz (Your Gut feelings 1994)"
2,the cd is the old edition not the new!!!,The cd was listed under the new edition of the book so I didn’t realize I was ordering the old edition. I was disappointed when my order arrived. Amazon should list the cd in a different area.The book itself is wonderful!
4,very helpful,"This book is full of easy to follow, very helpful info. I ordered one for myself and one for my sister. Great for anyone to read and learn from, especially for dealing with specific digestive issues. I am always researching for more ways to improve my health, specifically IBS and Candida yeast infections. A great way to take charge of your own health, armed with excellent knowledge."
5,digestive wellness,This is an exceptional book about the digestive system. I would highly recommend it. I also ordered the children's digestive wellness and it too is an exceptional and informative book.
5,everyone needs this info,"This is a great book, refresher for those medically trained, but fabulous information to help one with problems and to keep others healthy"
4,Great little book to encourage and inspire,"This book is not intended to compete with the C.S. Lewis' or Philip Yanceys. However, it is extremely well written and contains many surpising jems. It's not just another cute book to make a quick sell. The stories and topics within have depth. Soul Matters is a good little book to kick off a Bible study or discussion group-possibly a book to buy in bulk to give out to groups."
4,Soul does Matter.,"I bought this book and my friend who is from Louisianna fell in love with it, she was staying with us while hurricane Katrina was tearing up their city. She took great comfort in the book so I gave it to her and bought several more for gifts.I love books with short stories about life, it's a very positive upbeat book and helps you see things in a different light.It's full of good humor and good advice."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"If you've read any of my past reviews then, you know I'm not a big fan of Maisto products but like the other Maisto cars I own, they were purchsed for me by someone else. This car is actually not bad. I was pleased with the detal and as we all know, when it comes to diecast collectables, it's all in the detail."
2,5 stars subtracting 3 stars,"I have to agree with Randolph Wagner. This CD gets 5 stars for the choral pieces minus 3 stars for the recording quality. It sounds like the recording was transferred from an 8-track tape. This CD should have been sent back and remastered. If you have other Shaw CD's, you can hear for yourself the difference. This is NOT a quality recording. Why did they let this slip out the door?"
2,"If you're looking for a quality recording of the Martin Mass, look elsewhere.","If you're like me, and wanted to hear Robert Shaw's interpretation of the beautiful mass for double choir by Frank Martin,forget it. The interpretation is absolutely awful; way to slow, and completely devoid of feeling and flow. In some spots, Shaw blatantly disregards the piece's dynamic markings to the great detriment of the performance. Frank Martin, a tremendous and under-appreciated composer deserves far, far better than this. For a good interpretation of the mass, get the RIAS Kammerchor (great production values) or the Westminster Cathedral Choir recording."
1,I guess I'm just old-fashioned...,"I bought this CD for Barber's Agnus Dei, and unfortunately, that's the only track I really like! All the others are too weird and ""out there"" for me. Guess I'm just old-fashioned. :)"
3,Its written dryly,"I like text books where the author or authors write in a natural manner, so I graded this book as average as it doesn't flow smoothly. This book is very dry. I've had books on math that were written more smoothly, which is terribly difficult to do. Well, at least the book presents the facts necessary."
3,Not up to Par---for a Shaw Choir,"I have been a fan of Robert Shaw recordings for a very long time. I purchased this disc in hopes of finding the Quintessential recording of ""Hymn"". I did not find it. In the first movement, the choir sounds tired, but the diction is very clean and througout the second movement, the choir keeps up with the demanding tempo well. However the third movement becomes downright lethargic, and that blame goes directly to Shaw. Every great conductor has their own interpetations, but I can't figure out what Shaw was going for.The other pieces are nice, especially the Poulenc. I have not studied these works, so I can't comment on them, but they are worth a listen."
5,Master stylist,"Master stylist, careening from Chris Isaac parody to Who power stomp, a hundred changes packed into these 22 songs. 'Hostess' is a work of brilliant brevity, a four-movement Mall Quartet in the key of Pop. (7/7)"
5,perfect...,This album is without flaw. I gave this disk five stars and I rarely see anything as being perfect. There is not a single weak track. 22 beautifully composed songs for your listening pleasure. Black is a musical genius. TEENAGER OF THE YEAR is a masterpiece. If you are a Pixies fan you will love Frank Black's solo work. If you are not familiar with the Pixies or Frank Black I suggest you check them out.
4,"Not as good as Frank Black's debut, but......","its still damn good. Not nearly as accessible as pixie phenomena, but that's ok, compare it to anything else, its awesome. My favs ""i want to live on an abstract plain"" ""headache"" ""vanishing spies"" ""speedy marie"" ""calistan"" ""pie in the sky"" and ""thalasocracy."""
3,Patchy genius,"Like all Frank Black albums, this one is a mixture of delights and disappointments. But like everything else he's done, it's worth the price of admission for the good moments - especially if you can pick it up for a few bucks on Amazon. The first four tracks lay out Frank's stylistic palette beautifully: careering-out-of-control thrash (Whatever Happened To Pong); smart punk (Thallassocracy); catchy falsetto pop (Abstract Plain); and gorgeous mini-epic balladry (Calistan). From there on, though, it's a very mixed bag. For every masterpiece there are four or five total duds - some half-baked, some overblown, and some that start out nicely but then sputter to a close, as though Frank thought he had a good idea for a song, but then lost interest and couldn't be bothered finishing it properly (Fazer Eyes; Space Is Gonna Do Me Good). As always, the playing is faultless, and Frank does rhythm guitar with his usual lethal precision. But at 22 tracks it's all a bit indulgent."
3,Juvinielle finesse,"Black might have been a little oversold on songwriting brilliance when glancing this cited solo work. An indulgent offering of alt-rock, the Pixie frontman delivers many solidly off-kilter numbers but hardly creates worthwhile songs capable of the replay value of some of his more noteworthy co-creations, littered with occasional gems and standout passages but adding up to little more then outtakes for the fanbase."
5,It's Frank Black. Come on. How can you not love it?,"Twenty-plus songs, each of which will get you. This is definitely not the Pixies. I started listening to Frank Black's eponymous album before I heard of the Pixies (thanks to BMG mailing me a disc every month and my laziness in returning them), and when his sophomore solo album came out I had no choice but to buy it. Three times, in fact: One stolen, one broken, one shiny and new and lovely. I've never heard a songwriter whose lyrics were so thoughtful. Not croony, navel-gazing thoughtful, but thematic, intelligent, and thoughtfully constructed. His love of Los Angeles is apparent in this album, but not to the extent as in ""Frank Black.""This album cemented a love that endures to this day. FB, FB and the Catholics, FB collaborating with Reid Paley (check him out), none of it disappoints."
5,"Clever, original, bizzare, and hard rocking...all in one!","This album is a work of art. Through the course of the rock/popfusion of music, Frank sings ballads of imaginary places, archaicgames, fantasies, myths (both known legends and his own), and even grim tellings of real events (Like ""Bad Wicked World"", which tells of a man who is always looking for the truth, it eventually drives him to suicide). Nice inclusions of wordy words as well. Possibly the best of Black. (While I'm at it, here are some secret meanings behind the madness. ""Two Reelers"" is about the Three Stooges, ""Ole' Mulholland"" has science fiction inclusions, mentioning Ray Bradbury's mall. This could possibly be about a futuristic world run by the masters of sci-fi writing. ""Big Red"" is about living on Mars. ""Thallasocracy"" is about the earth-gaea theory, the word 'thallasocracy' means supremacy of the sea. ""The Vanishing Spies"" is about remote viewing. Many more secret meanings, so I'll sign off now.)"
1,1 mighty mouse cartoon and a bunch of faded others,"This is called Mighty mouse and friends, probably because there is only 1 mighty mouse cartoon!. Most of the cartoons are old Harveytoon / Paramount cartoons. All but 1 are badly faded. It's a real shame that no one is restoring these cartoons"
1,Mighty Mouse DVD,"I was very disappointed with this purchase as it was not what I thought it would be - I would almost say that it was false advertizing or false titling to be more exact. I thought I was going to purchase a DVD of cartoons about the Great Mighty Mouse (the flying mouse that rests on the crescent moon and flies to earth to redeem endangered soles and save the day - Mighty Mouse cartoons). Well there was one of them - the first, though this Mighty Mouse lived in a tree house (that was okay, as he still flew and did save all the endangered sheep that were being threatened by wolves in sheep clothing, no less), but that was the only one - all the rest, lots of them, the cartoons on the DVD, were just mouse being chased by the cat syndrome - much like Tom and Jerry cartoons, which are okay, but not what I ordered. Where is Mighty Mouse (not just the first cartoon and the rest are all ordinary stuff - I want Mighty Mouse)! More Mighty Mouse, less ordinary mouse."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I got this when I was 8 back in 2008, and now I'm 12. When I got this I was very excited to watch more Mighty Mouse than there are only one episode that is released, and I was ready to see more than one!And of course, when I got it, it had only one MIGHTY MOUSE! YAH, ONLY ONE!!! and the same old sheep episode too!! I'M SICK OF THAT EPISODE ONLY RELEASED ON DVD!!!! Yes, if you're wondering, I did throw it away. Dont waste your money on this piece of freaking crap!I mean who wants only 1 Mighty mouse episode if it's titled ""Mighty Mouse and Friends""???!!!"
2,Waste of money,"The use of archival and color photos get old quickly as the author uses himself as a model and tries to looks tough. He doesn't do this a couple of times, he doesn't he throughout the ENTIRE book. He fails miserably at trying to look tough. Additionally there are numerous inaccuracies throughout the book. Don't waste your time or money on this book. This book embarrasses Marines everywhere."
4,good reference,"A good reference book, but could use a little more detail on some of the lesser uniforms."
4,Good toaster no cancel function,"This toaster works well as you would expect. It's wide enough for bagels, and thicker breads and works efficiently. It's also pretty easy to clean. The only issue I have is that it has no cancel button. So if you want to stop toasting something you have to unplug it."
5,This book helped me a lot by its novel ideas,"Hello,I am interested in code generation and this book helpedme quite a lot. Out of many techniques presented, I liked theuse of XML transform for code generation most. This is reallya relatively easy way of achieving custom code generator inapplication software development projects. I applied thistechnique heavily in our Network Management System projectin the areas of:* EJB code generation* SNMP code generation* Java parametric code generation like C++ template(....)"
1,Bad Beano,"Beano is great; liquid beano is much more cost-effective than tablet. But this vendor seems to be shipping impotent product. The expiration date looks ok, but the effectiveness was minimal for me, and I'm a long-time user. Perhaps it has been subjected to heat. Note the vendor appears to be a ""liquidator"". Caveat emptor..."
5,Expiration date is VERY conservative,The expiration date on the bottle I received is 8/11. I am almost finished with a bottle with an expiration date of 11/97 and it still works fine for me.
5,Hmmm Hmmmm Good!,"Beano has always worked for me. I always take it on trips, or even just to local resturants if I know I'll be having beans,i.e., the local Mexican place."
2,Didn't work well for me.,"It's supposed to prevent gas, but it can't prevent mine no matter how much I used. What ended up working much better for me were probiotics like this: Accuflora-Controlled Probiotic Acidophilus Delivery, 240 Caplets."
2,At the risk of sounding like a dunce...,"I bought this thinking it was a larger bottle, based on reading the product description. Whether I didn't understand the description clearly, or whether the description itself was unclear, I'm not sure.Regardless, I know I could have found a better deal. .51 fluid ounces???"
2,"Cute, but not effective","This isn't as good as other brands. Buy The cool wrap 303 if you want one that really works great. This one is cute, but it doesn't expand uniformly--and it's too big around to sit comfortably around your neck. Feels/looks silly."
1,Disappointed,"This bandana has only about a third as much gel as it needs, and the gel clumps up in one small space. Didn't work for me. Maybe they changed the product since the other reviews."
4,"Good, but they've been better",Overall it's a good cd. Uncle Harry and There is No Radio are good songs and overall it's really good. But as most bands will go they don't live up to their old stuff but still retain most of their punk origins.
4,delay in receiving items,"we have been very happy with the product, however, a faster economical shipping option would have been greatly appreciated."
3,Not quite as bad as people say,"Sure, '80's production was tacky, but there wasn't anything tacky about Let's Dance or Ziggy Stardust? Bowie always has his tongue in his cheek. He acknowledges the artifice of his chosen art form. I don't think he took many of his other albums any more seriously than he took this one.Never Let Me Down is artificial- and tacky-sounding. There are fewer ""concepts"" on this album than on many of his others. But it's still a lot of fun, if you're open-minded and willing to laugh at yourself (and to laugh along with the artist)."
2,"Ah, but you did!","One of Bowie's weakest recordings, Never Let Me Down is a an album with no direction. The songs don't seem to mesh in any discernible fashion and often seem like throwaways. Bowie's voice is at best disinterested and the music seems to have been recorded in a tunnel. Because it is Bowie, there are still a few songs that are worthwhile but only for completists is this set a neccessity."
1,"Yes, it is that bad","Sometimes I think critics like to pile on and slam the latest album by an aging star without really listening to it. However, the critics were right about this one. Don't listen to all the Bowie-heads out there. This one blows.I'd be hard pressed to find a record in my collection (over 600 cds) that is worse than this. There is not a single great or even good song on this album. The title track and ""Time Will Crawl"" are okay, and ""Day In Day Out"" is listenable. The rest of the album doesn't even meet that minimal standard. And ignore that other guy--""Too Dizzy"" sucks, too.If there is one thing this site proves, its that no matter how unquestionably bad a record is (and , yes, sometimes a record is so unquestionably bad that no allowances can be made for ""matters of taste""), there are people out there who will like it.For the Bowie completist only."
2,BOWIE LETS HIMSELF DOWN,"This is probably Bowie's worst album, where he hit, for me at least, creative rock bottom. The 80s and image of success had absolutely, nearly ruined Bowie as a serious artist. This album doesn't help whatsoever. I recall the Day in Day out Video with Bowie singing on rollerblades and poofed up hair. The songwriting is vapid, and Bowie's sensibilities had shifted so much, I'm sure many of his original fans couldn't really relate to this. Apart from the naff Glass Spider Tour, which I watched in Pontiac, Michigan way back when - and which is available on video - about the only good things out of this album were the cover of Iggy Pop's ""Bang Bang"" - a great live addition for Bowie's repertoire and ""Zeroes"" - an underrated song that never got much airplay. Bowie can, I believe, churn out commercial songs at will - but I'm not convinced his heart was in this one."
1,Absolute garbage,"I don't know what he was thinking when he produced this one. This is a good example of Bowie departing to a new style, unfortunately it's a bad one. One is much better off sticking with Hunky Dory, Low, basically anything else in his collection, this one is a stinker..."
3,It's pretty good,"When I first got this album, I listened to it a lot. I do that with all albums, though. I have a feeling after a while that it will sit on the shelf more than Bowie's other albums. 3 stars means I like it. It's nothing too special, but it's pretty good. The good songs are Never let me down, Time will crawl, Beat of your drum, New York's in Love, Shining Star and Bang Bang. More than half of them. Yes this album is worth buying. Too Dizzy, the song left off on the rerelease is worthless. Ask any hardcore Bowie fan and they'll agree"
3,over-produced but ok,Not as bad as many believe - apart from the terrible Glass Spider. Some decent songs and the title track was one of Bowie's good singles of the '80s.
3,So-So Late '80's Outing for Bowie,"This is one of the few Bowie albums about which I am completely ambiguous. I can either take it or leave it. I own this album on vinyl, as well as the corresponding ""?,"" a radio interview album. The title track on this album was dedicated to Bowie's long-time personal assistant/gatekeeper Corinne ""Coco"" Schwab, and it is a pleasant-enough ballad. My favorite cut on this album is a cover of Iggy Pop's ""Bang Bang,"" which is given a certain disdainful treatment by Bowie.As an aside, this album's music provided the inspiration for Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider tour, with its huge stage and well-choreographed dance show. I would recommend the tour video over this album, frankly."
4,Too Dizzy? : (,"Supposedly the 1999 re-releases were going to stay true to the original release of each album. Well, this isn't the case with ""Never Let Me Down."" ""Too Dizzy"", which was not included on the '95 re-release, is not included on the '99 re-release. I own the original version of ""Never Let Me Down"" and ""Too Dizzy"" is definitely a track that deserves to be included on the all of the re-releases. Nonetheless, this is Bowie's last solo contribution of the '80s and does deserve some attention. Most notably the songs ""Never Let Me down"" and ""Beat Of Your Drum."""
4,Why you Not Givin My Man Some Respect???!!,"Come on People, this is platinum Bowie stuff here. Most of these songs are great, and don't have many problems with them. The background tunes work wonderful with his singing, which seems to be a problem in some of his future albums (AKA Hours... and a few in Earthling). His fame came from the 80s, and like always, he returns to his old roots and comes out strong in this pop/rock orientated blast of good music and jumpy dance hits. A definite buy for Bowie fans and 80s rock music fans..~*^Sam^*~"
4,Just awesome...and overloooked.,"I LOVE Bowie as much as the next. Maybe it's my age (this album came out when I was a kid), but I love the overall feel of this album. It's continued proof of ""the Chameleon's"" skills to completely re-modify his style (with the times) and continue to put out quality work. Not his best album, but just a fantastic effort into these tracks."
1,Made me embarassed to be a Bowie fan....,"...a terrible record. Not much to say, really. A long time Bowie fan, I am, starting with Diamond Dogs, and I adore this man! Even the tour was embarassing. I was actually glad he self-destructed and started Tin Machine, whose debut record was, along with Scary Monsters, the BEST records he did in the 80's! EMI should erase 'Let's Dance', 'Tonight' and 'NLMD' from his catalogue (ok, maybe put out a compilation from those 3 records plus a few other 80's rarities as decent tracks are scattered throughout) and put 'David Live' and 'Stage' back into print. I'll even help EMI by providing the track list, which we'll call 'Bowie Cashes In':Cat People (original soundtrack version)Under PressureModern LoveChina GirlLet's DanceLoving the AlienBlue JeanAbsolute BeginnersThis Is Not AmericaWhen The Wind BlowsDay In Day OutTime Will CrawlJulieGirls"
3,I'll be honest........,"I have most of Bowies albums but the only reason I bought this seemingly maligned cd for the Iggy Pop cover Bang Bang(I'm a bigger Iggy fan).I have heard quite a few unflattering remarks about this album from many David fans,and for the most part they were right.....but there are some redeeming tracks to be found.I was happy with the Pop cover but found Zeros and the spoken word Glass Spider to be very good.The rest of the tracks truly epitomize ""hit or miss"".....if you liked Bowies 80s work this will probably be quite a collection for you...if not you may want to find a used copy at a good price..of course for completists it is a must."
5,Greater than ever DAMN STRAIGHT,"This one of the best releases in the last few years. It competes with the Clone Defects, White Stripes, and other Detroit rock and roll. Get this as soon as possible. Listen to Arch Enemy at Big Neck website and you'll see what I mean"
4,the name comes from.......,The late 70's gang movie 'The Warriors'. Baseball Furies was a gang in the movie. Is this CD any good? I haven't a clue. That's what I'm trying to find out!!
2,Wobbly,"I bought the item when it was over $1,000 about two years ago. It arrived with broken parts and parts that were not lined up properly. The final piece put together is a wobbly mess. It is not square and it constantly needs pushed back in alignment. The doors do not shut properly since it is not appropriately lined up. The drawer for the keyboard does not roll in and out because the ball barrings began falling out of the tracks before it was out of the box. Out of the four door knobs, only three are the same, one looks completely different than the others.I am not sure if this is the same seller as when I bought it, but they did replace broken parts easily, except they would not replace the keyboard drawer hardware.Some day, I will have to take it all apart and use metal L brackets to strengthen the structure. It is a beautiful piece of furniture, made with real, heavy wood, but the structure is just not strong."
5,How can you go wrong?,"I have had the opportunity to listen to one track from this CD, and that is Vestal and Dolly Parton singing Martha Carson's gospel standard ""Satisfied."" If that were the only song on the whole CD it would be worth the price. Everything else is just a bonus."
5,Tide,This is beyond wonderful. I ordered this for my husband for Christmas but when it came in and I saw how cute it is I went ahead and gave it to him. We have a white Scottie and it looksd just like her. There are few things out there with the white Scottie. I am beyond happy and pleased.
1,Good for a year...then it's junk,This laptop fell apart piece by piece after a year. It's a good thing I purchased an overpriced HP warranty to replace the parts b/c it's garbage. Either get a Dell or get a mac. Don't waste your time on this unless the only thing you'll be doing is surfing the internet. Anything else and it's garbage.
3,Choline - Start up conservatively,"Items were received in a timely manner from the vendor.Regardless of the vendor, if you are just starting choline, my recommendation is to start conservatively.It was recommended to start off with 2,000 mg daily (8 capsules) to improve memory function for a relative. *This was too much.* Side-effects of irritability and headache were onset within a day. Reduced dosage to 250 mg (1 capsule) and symptoms went away. Gradually increasing this by 250 mg per week, and no symptoms observed with 750 mg (3 capsules) per day.It is too early to speculate on its effectiveness, as we were told it would take about 3 months before any benefits, if any, might be observed.This is our experience, and yours may be different. Just be conservative and do not expect an ""instant"" transformation of memory, brain whatever, .... Finally, I seriously doubt you can expect a significant life extension better than just controlling your diet, regular exercise and reading."
3,a bit coarse,"Sadly, I first tried Fireworks brand popcorn salt. It clung well to the popcorn, and was it was quite fine. I came across it in a gift pack, so when I ran out, I was unable to find more as a stand-alone product.So I picked this 6-pack up. The salt is more coarse, thus it doesn't stick to popcorn as well. I would've probably been happy as a pickle if I had tried this first, as popcorn salt has disappeared off grocery store shelves (beggars can't be choosers). So, if this is all there is to find, it works. If you can find something more fine, I would opt for that choice."
1,Truly horrible,"If you like your popcorn with a bit of salt as I do, avoid this product. Trust me. It is full of odd ingredents,and completely devoid of flavor. I picked it up at the store two weeks ago, because it was the only item available (*real* popcorn salt has, for some reason, completely disappeared from the shelves).(Amazon - please - allow us to give a ZERO star review.)"
2,Flows too fast for accurate seasoning,"I admit that I am only reviewing this here because of my frustration with this product. My store stopped carrying the old standby brand with the adjustable sift top and only carries this fancy labeled alternative now. The holes are simply too big for fine salt; you cannot get good control if you seek perfection in your seasoning. I have ruined more than one batch using this dispenser. Unless you are extremely careful, you will oversalt your popcorn."
1,"Attractive, but not Stainless Steel","These are attractive and hefty. The listing says they are stainless steel, but they have rusted over time. When new, they are very shiny and I'm guessing they are chrome-plated. I would not have bought these if I knew they were not stainless steel... and I bought a bunch of these... unfortunately.One other comment is that these bells do not have a loop for attaching to keychains or strings. Instead, it has a small knob which attaches to the wrist band. This only matters if you plan to remove the bells and attach it to something else. Hope that makes sense.PROS:Attractive when new.Durable wrist band.CONS:Rusts over time... not stainless steel!"
1,"I can't believe it, but what a bust","Of all folks, I'm definitely biased towards Maynard in that I'm a huge fan (have most of his material etc...). But this CD is a total bust. And it's due to the pop-ish nature of the CD; Hey, I like Rocky, the disco type Star Trek version; I have no problem with his more pop oriented stuff. But this CD just has lousy songs; forget the genre, just plain lousy songs. It just makes you think, what in the world was going on with Maynard at that time? Oh well, a word to the wise, definitely save your money and skip this CD."
5,Best martial arts product I own,"It's a little pricey given you get one, not a pair, but it has been worth it. The knee pads not only protect my knees during sparring, they are the best knee braces I've ever had. I work out in them every day. The gel makes it easier for me to kneel and get up from the ground than I'm normally able to do. My knees are in pretty bad shape from multiple injuries and arthritis, but this lets me function much better than I can with a typical ACE type of brace.Warning: lay them out in the open air to dry out after a workout. Don't dry them in a dryer (the instructions tell you this). They wash very well in cold water with the rest of the laundry."
5,Great knee pad,Knee pad is like the ones I had and last forever! Easy to get on and off and machine washable don't fall apart. Very nice knee pad!
2,READ PRODUCT NAME!,"Ordered this for paintball, allot of people had good reviews on it and it seemed cheap so i bought it. Turned out its a KNEE PAD, not KNEE PADS haha. So i spent all that money on one pad, that i dont even use because i wanted a pair. Quality is ok, and it fits alright. Gets uncomfortable after awhile so i would stick with a different brand of knee PAD. Shipping was very fast and i didn't have any problems with the seller, just wish it stated its a single knee pad in bold...You know how us internet shoppers get! haha"
3,Bummed there was only 1,"great gel knee pad, but would be better if there were two in a package and better sales description of quantity in package."
1,Watching paint dry is more exciting than this book,"Too bad Amazon does not allow one to leave 0 stars in the review. This one deserves 0.If you seek boredom at a price (buying the book), this is for you, for it is one of the most boring books on the subject in world history.Pat Brown: ""The goal of this book is to teach everyone how to identify predators so we can make our streets safer for all.""So this book was going to teach me how to identify predators?Ann Rule worked with Bundy and never identified him and Pat Brown presumes to be able to teach ""everyone"" how to identify predators?The joke is on whoever buys this book. In this case, it is on me. But I won't be buying any more Pat Brown books."
2,Iffy,"This book was interesting but it shows that Pat Brown really is not a profiler. If she is considered a profiler, I feel bad for the professionals. I suggest this book as a read for fun but not an educational read."
1,Waste of time...,"I volunteer teach at our local prison. I was doing some research and thought I'd read this book--waste of time! Brown is snarky, cynical and anything but an authority. I do believe in hands on experience but there is a reason academic education is also valued. Brown's book is full of opinion, not supported by fact or any references. She quotes killers as her references...that says a lot about her education or lack thereof. What sort of author says ""Oh, well."" She wants her readers offended. Then she claims to have written from the view of a serial killer? Isn't she the author? She's an opinionate person--ok, who isn't? Waste of time."
1,Different opinions out there,"I have never written a review before and am sorry that I felt I had to write this one. After looking forward to this book I was greatly disappointed. I have read other profile books and always came away feeling like I learned something. The author seemed to have little to no use for law inforcement or profilers and made many of the profilers sound egocentric. It almost seemed like there was some hard feelings between them. I think I could learn more watching forensic files for an hour then reading this book. She tended to explain the most mundane words in the book so you felt almost as if she was talking to a child with the whole ""SHE"" examples. I felt it was poorly written. It did not give any information that I felt most people don't already know. It didn't seem to be written well. There really is much in the book to recommend. I would try other profile books out there first."
2,a brief review,"This book is written in a question and answer format. It may be helpful for someone that is looking for an INTRODUCTION to serial killers. It is devoid of detailed (or gory) case details. If you have already read other books about individuals like Ed Gein, Armin Meiwes, and John Wayne Gacy, this will not keep your interest."
4,Hard for parent,"Very difficult for parent to read to toddlers w/o crying. Well written, heart felt. Toddlers seem to be comforted. Thank you Mr. Rogers."
3,OK but not Great,"This was an OK book, but not quite what I expected for the child. There must be other books out there that give a better example and a bit more compassion for the childs feelings in not so straight forward words. It did OK, but wish it had done better."
2,Not What I Wanted,"I bought this to help my 5 year old when we put our cat to sleep, but I never even showed it to her. I was looking for something a little more emotional, and this was more factual. There's absolutely nothing wrong or inappropriate about it at all. It just wasn't at all what I was looking for."
3,when a piet dies by Mister Rogers,"I recently lost a 13 year old dog and I am an adult. The book was not appropriate for me, but would be great for a child."
2,For the VERY youmg,"I purchased this for two young friends, boys: 6 and 10This book was way too immature for the ten year old and even the six year old lost interest in it. I purchased other books on the subject of losing a pet to death that the kids read with more interest.I would recommend this only for children under five."
4,"Mr Rogers' book, ""When a Pet Dies""","""When a Pet Dies"" is a book intended to help children understand and cope with the death of a favorite pet. I believe it does. Well illustrated with to the point photos, it gives the joy of having a pet and the sorrow of having one die. It allows the child to realize that each person is unique, and may have their own way of expressing their grief and their own way of recovering from that grief.As a near 75 year old man, I bought the book to see how Mr Rogers handled this subject and he did extremely well. I can remember some of the pets that I have had over the years and even the ones that i knew and had 65 years ago still have a place in my being.""When a pet dies, we can grow to know that the love we shred is still alive in us and always will be."", is the concluding sentence of the book and is a great one because it is always true."
3,a very direct approach,"While I found this book to be a good tool to discuss the loss of a pet with my 7 year old. I was a bit shocked at the directness of the issue at hand. It did bring forward the emotions that we were all feeling with the loss. This book however, does allow the child to greive and know that what they are feeling is ""normal"" and crying is okay. This was well done in the typical manner of ""Mr. Rogers"" he got me through alot as a child and now is helping me with my children."
3,something's missing,"This book did a good job of explaining the facts about losing a pet, but did not touch on the emotional impact of such a loss at all. I read it to my daughter, along with several other books about the loss of a pet. It had it's place, but I'm glad it wasn't the only book I read to her. The others did a much better job of dealing with the heartache of losing a pet."
2,PDA Yes Laptop No Support non-existent,"I got this card to work with Dell X5 PDA and my Sony T610 phone. However, I cannot get it to work with my Dell Latitude Laptop running Win 2000. It finds the remote device, allows connections, but if you try to move files, you get a protection error. Synchronization using the Sony software never finds the phone, even if it is connected, bonded.. Emails to Socket support get no reply. No mention of problems or hints in their FAQ. No updates for the Windows software or drivers on the website (they seem to be selling this software for previous card buyers). They get two stars because it worked with the PDA.Gratuitous comment: why does anyone think Bluetooth has a future? It is more complicated than wifi, slower, and seems more difficult to use. Once the low power wifi chips enter the market, bye-bye Bluetooth."
2,Works with my GPS but does not have headset profile,"Pro'sSupports Bluetooth 1.1 SpecWork with Socket Bluetooth GPSWorks with Palm PDAPC CARD with CF when used the notebook the card sticks out very little.This is a big plus because if you have kids and use a USB adapter you will end up breaking it easily as sticks out from the notebookCon'sCrappy software**DOES NOT SUPPORT HEADSET PROFILE** I recently purchased a iogear headset for IM Chatting and realized that I could not use with my headset as this does not support headset profileVery bad technical support,They charge for any software written and abs no free upgrades.Very expensiveConclusion----------If you are not interested in upgrades and happy with the exisitng functionality then go for it but at current market rate you have better choices.It does work with windows 98I would not recommend it but if this is used with win98 then this card works and i have used it"
2,Redundant with Outlook,"This program creates allowed and not-allowed lists for you to put email senders into. You have to indicate for each email which list it belongs in so that future emails from that sender are slotted in the correct file. This is the white list/black list way of doing things. Outlook Express already has this capability in the message rules, plus allows for screening based on words, domains, as well as sender name. So, I couldn't see any reason to pay for the capabilities."
2,Not what anyone expects,"BEWARE!!!of anything not allowing sound samples. This is an example. Insipid, drug-addled misfires of no resemblance to originals and little to current best-ofs. This is not a ""revival"" of anything suggested."
5,great purchase,This vacuum is powerful and quiet. I like the clear window on the container so I can see when it needs to be cleaned out - without taking the container off. The vendor was prompt. The product arrived ahead of schedule.
3,Just Average,"This sling is just an average piece. The bottom line is that it has a stretch capability that I'm not sure about. When I get out there Hog hunting thru the brush, the test will be there. It is mounted on my 7.62 X 54n and we shall see how stable/comfortable it makes the shots."
5,What a great CD,"This is one of my favorite CDs of all time, and the CD that launched Bryan White's career. Songs like ""Someone Else's Star"" and ""Rebecca Lynn"" are becoming country classics. Even though it was released almost 15 years ago, these songs are timeless. Love it!"
4,A good debut!,"If a music career could be compared to a race, Bryan White is off to an amazing start. The quality of this CD belies the fact that it is a freshman recording. It is as good if not better than most Sophmore efforts. Someone else's star contians the wistfulness many can relate to, Look at me now demands attention and then there's Rebecca Lynn, which beautfully captures the certainty of true love. All of these songs are wonderfully sung. Bryan White's most endearing quality may be the innocence with which he delivers his music."
4,Bryan White CD,"When I first heard of Bryan White, I was impressed, so I bought his second CD (Now and Forever). Since Amazon makes it so easy and fun to shop, I typed in his name and found more CD's that I didn't know existed. I was able to listen to samples of this CD and the other albums he has made. Boy was I missing out, so I bought the rest of them to add to my collection.If you like update new country music, you will like Bryan White. I will be a loyal fan."
1,Would not recommend Pro Commerce,I ordered these bug lights and they arrived broken. They were not wrapped in protective covering at all just put in a cardboard box. I contacted them and they told me to send them back and they would refund my money. I returned them 2 weeks ago and still have not received my refund and they will not answer my e-mails. I had been talking to a customer relations manager called Mark L and he completely ignores my e-mails.
2,Propaganda,"""To the victor go the spoils,"" including the ""right"" to revise history. I was disheartened when I saw this film because the greater part of it is Bolshevik propaganda from the Revolution. Sure, there are facts, like dates, locations, little things like that. But instead of truly researching the person of Tsar Nicholas II, the Geographic people were content to simply regurgitate what the party-line of the Soviet Union had been in regards to the Tsar. Obviously this information is very biased. Unfortunately, since most information about the Tsar that we have today was written after the Revolution, either by the Soviets or by people who had the Soviets as their sole source of information, one really cannot find a non-biased source. There is, of course, the Russian Orthodox Church, but scholars seem to view them as being an even more biased source than the Soviets were. In any case, take the statements in this film with a BOULDER of salt."
1,Recycled Imagery; Biased Narration,"All - Nicholas II, entire family, Rasputin - are depicted in the same inaccurate, flat caricatures as those created by the Revolutionary propagandists. Anna Vyrubova is not discussed at all, nor does she appear in any of the photography. To give the crumb of credit where it is due, this film does contain bout 2 minutes worth of engaging footage of the Romanov children at play. Otherwise, it offers only still photographs most people interested in Russian history have seen before and often.I give this documentary the following scores, on a 1-5 scale:Objectivity: 1Originality: 0"
5,Contents,"ojibwa crafts[chippewa]by carrie a lyford1953 ~ second Editionfrom inside cover ""This is the fifth volume in the series of books published by the Education Branch of the Bureau of Indian Affairs setting forth in popular language what is known about Indian arts and crafts in specific areas...... In the preparation of the present pamohlet , Miss Lyford made several trips to the Great Lakes and consolidated Chippewa reservations. Much time was spent by her in the homes of the Ojibwa Indians."" This is a detailed book with diagrams in the back. Traces the history of the Ojibwa, their way of life and their handicrafts. The definitive work of its time, detailing the many types of Ojibwa workmanship and materials. Illustrated with many photos and diagrams. 216 pages."
3,really enjoyed it.........didn't love it......(3.5/5),"a nice record; one that reminds me a bit of ""Rare Earth"" in it's interesting use of percussion/vocals/instrumentals. Derek Trucks plays with great style on slide guitar/dobro and the songs are intriguing - i like the fact that his playing is not the entire focus of the album.having said all of the above, i have only listend through the record four/five times. this seems like the type of cd that ""grows"" on a person.i recommend this record - the musicianship, on each instrument, is top-notch as is the sound/production. it's just not (yet) the one i reach for at the end (or beginning) of a long day."
4,best album yet!,"This is a great album. It's more song driven than the previous discs with fewer extended, instrumental only jazz/blues jams. And the addition of Mike Mattison as lead singer is a terrific change. ""I'd rather be blind, crippled & crazy"" is a great song in the spirit of the subdudes. ""I wish I knew (How It Would Feel To Be Free)"" is also a raucous gospel infused party song that feels like Robert Randolf and the blind boys of alabama meet John Cleary. ""Crow Jane"" is great acoustic soul blues. ""Chevrolet "" and ""Revolution"" are rockin' songs that remind me of Mark Broussard. And of course it all sounds a little (or alot) like the Allman Bros, and that's a good thing."
3,Dissapointing at best,"I can say that I seem to be the only person that is dissapointed by this album. For those of you who know and love Derek Trucks you know he plays a mean guitar. How is the guitar on this most recent album you ask? I have yet to find it. The songs are good if you want to listen to a good singer and a good backup band. If your looking for sizzling guitar work, look elsewhere. If I had to describe this album in one word, that word would be: soft. I hate to say it but it is. There is not one song that really has that rockin, get up and dance feeling to it. Where are the guitar solos??? Where is the energy??? I have to say this album is NOT one of his finest as most here will say. Don't get me wrong, I love Derek Trucks. I think he is one of the best guitarists out right now, but this album doesn't really show his true talents. Sorry..."
2,Derek Trucks-Songlines,This CD was very disappointing. The guitar rifs were sloppy and there were maybe two songs that were worthy of the purchase.
4,Magic in a bottle,"I knew I started to hear it in the Allman Brothers Band the last couple of years, those ""tweaks"" that reminisced of Duane, but now Derek Trucks emotions now come out full blast! What a feel, really magic in his bottle. Such a groove, and the Middle Eastern influences coincide so perfectly with the snarling swamp slide. This guy is the real thing, no slide guitar player comes to mind that is alive that can emote the way Trucks can. By and large the songs and music is so much more evolved, but the playing...music when done correctly can take us to a better place, and this guy does it right. Give me more!"
5,Incredible,"Along with Little Feat's Waiting For Columbus, this may be the greatest album of all time!!!"
1,"""Waste"" Is Right!","I agree with the people who have said this workbook is a waste of money. If you own the book, you don't need the workbook. Enough said."
4,Great reference software,"I'm a seminarian for the Catholic Church and this product has helped me a lot in my studies. I use it for my scripture classes, theology classes, morality classes, homiletics, everything. It is a wonderful tool and I would highly recommend it. It also saved me a lot of money because each of the ""new dictionaries"" are expensive. Having it on the computer allows me to search for things a lot quicker."
4,Not as bad as you've heard,"I feel that Bowie changes with every new album so I always go in listening to Bowie with open ears, not prejudice. This is a fine album. I think that Bowie was trying to go for a more latin sound than Let's Dance. The title track is disposable, but it's the only one. I liked this album, maybe it's because I am a Bowie fan, but give this album a chance, you may like it."
3,LOST BUT LISTENABLE,"As other reviews here put - this album represented Bowie's lost years in the 80s. The days when he would go into studio and perform but show none of his edge except for a few good songs here and there. That's the key word that people come to expect from Bowie - cutting edge. This one is blunt for some, and for me was Bowie-lite. I still listen to it now and then and know the album well. It doesn't quite hit the mark, but I listen to it because I treat it as the man playing around - not being too serious about it. The choice of songs is questionable but not unlistenable. More covers than originals. If you are a Bowie fan and want to add this into your collection, I would say go ahead. But don't hold Bowie to his usual standards of musical integrity."
1,Document of its time,"This is generally considered to be one of bowie's worst albums, and for good reasons. That isn't to say there's nothing enjoyable on ""Tonight"". There's the fine opener ""Loving the alien"", the flawless pop of ""Blue jean"", and the rocking (albeit in a 80-ish fashion) ""Neighborhood threat"". But the album suffers heavily of a overall lack of inspiration; in production, songwriting, and instrumentation. It almost completely consists of recycled Iggy Pop collaborations(eg.,the earlier mentioned ""Neighboorhood Threat"")and covers (eg.,an absolutely horrifying version of ""God only knows""),all done in that typical eighties synth-pop way. But since every album is a document of its time, for a truly comlete reconstruction of Bowie's career even ""Tonight"" is a necessity. Just don't expect to find more than (very)vague hints of Bowie's genius as a songwriter and singer on this one."
5,David Bowie,"Who hasn't heard of David Bowie?? I must admit that I have never owned any music that he has made but I just wanted one song and it happened to be on this CD. He is one of a kind and that comes through with his music. A genuis and this CD reflects that.""God only knows what I'd be without you""."
2,"Better than the next album, though that's not saying much...","When I first borrowed this album on vinyl, it got off to a pretty promising start. ""Loving the Alien"" is more ""Bowie"" than a good deal of the stuff on Let's Dance (though that album is still a good pop album). ""Blue Jean"" is the only other decent song on this album; the rest, unfortunately, is incredibly bland. It IS better than Never Let Me Down, the album that followed it, but that's not saying much....if you do want to buy it, get it used for a decent price (under $10). If you're not too keen on `80s Bowie and don't want to buy the entire album, find a US copy of the Rykodisk Singles set (it's not in print anymore)--it includes ""Blue Jean,"" the special single version of ""Loving the Alien,"" and some other singles-only songs that are well worth getting (plus, of course, tons of `70s singles, though they sound tinny compared to the more recent Virgin/BMI remasters)."
2,Two and a half stars,"Bowie hits his first slump on this album. 'Blue Jean' , along with a couple of other tracks are good pop songs, but it's just padded out with too much filler. Even its high points don't match Let's Dance's, but on the plus side (or should that be down side?), this album is at least a bit longer. You have to accept that Bowie is no longer the avant garde enigma he once was, and just try to enjoy what's left. Which isn't much. 'Tumble and Twirl' is given a brisk, funky backing, and it's good fun, too.Yet half the album is made up of, at times embarrassing, filler. I especially don't want to hear Bowie singing about 'Old Rudy' in a cod-Jamaican accent ('Don't Look Down'), and the inclusion of a Beach Boys cover is the sound of a man without ideas, trying to get by as a crooner. I'd pick this up on Marketplace if you see it for a couple of quid."
2,"Disappointing Follow-Up to ""Let's Dance""","Even upon its 1984 release, David Bowie's ""Tonight"" was considered a major letdown after the breakthrough success of ""Let's Dance"" (1983). However, there are a few memorable tracks scattered among the wreckage. ""Blue Jean,"" ""Don't Look Down"" and ""Neighborhood Threat"" certainly stand out, but ""Loving the Alien"" and the wretched remake of ""God Only Knows"" represent Bowie at his self-parodying worst. The title song cries for a remix, since it buries Tina Turner's accompanying vocal. What was Bowie thinking? If you must purchase this directionless effort, hunt down the out-of-print Ryko version with the bonus tracks of ""Absolute Beginners"" and ""This Is Not America."""
2,This is not very good...,"Well this was a massive disappointment. Having loved 'Loving The Alien' and thinking 'Blue Jean' was quite good, I bought this album, thinking all the reviews previously were exaggerating the quality of the album. Unfortunately, I was Wrong.The title track is horrible, just 80s pop at its worst, although i quite like the soft-reggae 'Don't Look Down', and the cover of the Beach Boys classic isnt as bad as you would think. For the second half of the album, things take a definite turn for the worse, although there is a nice brass accompliment for a couple of the songs. The last 3 tracks are terrible by Bowies standards and completlely unmemorable, im listening to Dancing With The Big Boys now, and I cant pick out a chorus at all.Overall, a pretty bad album, the only songs i would listen to out of choice are Loving the alien, God only knows and Blue Jean, 2 of which are on the Best of Bowie album. AVOID."
3,You've got to take Bowie with a grain of salt,This is Bowie's highly entertaining take on lounge schmaltz. You will hear the cheesiest arrangements and Bowie's most melodramatic croon.Fans that take their music too seriously need not purchase this one.
1,Too Hard to install modem,I bought this modem to run with my IVM (Interactive Voice Machine) I did finely get it to work. Some problems I encountered.No CD and not enough paperwork to download the drivers. I called tech support and they said download here. The driver they have wasn't an exe file. I spent too much time figuring it out. I had to beat it into my computer. (lol)Full duplex no way this is a half duplex modem. just copy the full duplex and half duplex and past it into Google and do your research. Also the caller I.D didn't work at all. BummerThe Multi-Tech website has software that you can download to use with the modem but you had to buy it. I did try the software but I wouldn't buy it for the price. It was hard to use and it had a doss like look and ran like doss. you can find better phone software on the net.
3,"I ""think"" Watts is playing beautifully!","I bought this CD to add to my MacDowell Piano Concerto collection. I love the piece and have heard Watts play it in person so I know he does a wonderful job with the composition.The problem with this recording is that to my ears, the Telarc engineers muddled up an otherwise beautiful performance. Rarely is the piano heard above the orchestra and most of MacDowell's fun and wild passage-work is lost. The orchestra plays well as does Watts, when you can hear him. This is not my stereo system as it is state of the art and other CD's sound just fine. It's a shame because you just know that beautiful playing is there behind all the muddy acoustics. Same problems with both Liszt Concertos as well."
5,Literate Lyrics and an Astounding Voice,"If you aren't familiar with Katell Keineg, but you like women with amazing voices and incredible song-writing abilities, you should become familiar with Katell Keineg. Helps if you like blues. Helps if you like jazz. Helps if you like strong, smoky voices that can hiss, growl, scream and croon.Of her three albums, this one remains my favorite, possibly because it blew me away back when it was first released. It still blows me away."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have the misfortune of owning one of these and I'd like to spare everyone else from making the same mistake I did.The product works, but only for about 5 minutes before it starts skipping parts of the song it happens to be playing. If it weren't for the skipping, this would be a decent product.The other problem is that there is absolutely no support from the manufacturer. All of the emails I have sent regarding the skipping have gone unanswered.Don't bother buying this product. Donate the money to charity instead. At least it will be used for a good cause that way."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product is not good. Did not come with an operation's manual, and as soon as i hooked it up to the player, my player froze. The charger didn't even work. Amazon should not be selling this product."
2,All cracked,When I received this shipment a majority of the binders were cracked and spilt. They were shipped in a cardboard box with no padding and it appears that they were not protected enough. I guess you get what you pay for: the cheap quality of this product reflects its inexpensive price.
4,"Perhaps the most ""commercial friendly"" Phish album to date?","""Hoist"" is perhaps the most media-friendly Phish album to date, if such a beast is possible. The songs are not extremely long, yet they get the job done. Sure, it's best to hear a twenty minute 'Down with Disease' live in concert, but you have to start somewhere, and ""Hoist"" is the place. In many places on the album, it seems as if the band wants to go somewhere, starts to take off, but never really leaves the ground. That is, until the Split Open and Melt jam in the middle of 'Demand'. _This_ jam is Phish at its best, and is what really makes the disc a good one."
3,3 STARS JUST BY A HAIR,"HOIST CONTAINS A FEW OF THE SONGS THAT ACTUALLY GOT SOME RADIO PLAY ON AN ALTERNATIVE/POP STATION IN ATLANTA. BUT THIS CD WANDERS ALL OVER THE MAP, UNLIKE BILLY BREATHES IT FOLLOWS NO FOR OR FUNCTION, POOR EDITING IN MY OPINION. CLEARLY, I WOULD BY JUNTA, PICTURE OF NECTAR, OR BILLY BREATHES BEFORE THIS ONE."
4,Phish for people who usually don't like Phish,"I should probably get this out of the way first. I'm not typically a Phish fan and have a very low tolerance for jam band music. I find the genre riddled with overly-long and musically self-indulgent songs. That said, Phish's ""Hoist"" is a notable exception in their catalog in that I tend to really like it. It owes more to the tradition of the off-kilter rock-funk of outfits like Primus than it does to the jam band tradition of the Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers. It's songs are generally shorter and more concise than a typical Phish album. It may not be the album of choice for the Phish die-hards, but it is a great Phish album for those of us not in their typical audience demographic."
5,Phish at Their Best,"I admit I'm not the biggest Phishead on the planet. Perhaps that's why this is my favorite Phish album. Insidiously catchy, deliriously fun, by turns maudlin and madcap, this album gives you the most fun per minute of any Phish you can get. As far as I'm concerned, ""Hoist"" was the pinnacle of Phish's career, and it was certainly around the peak of their commercial success as well. By the time they got to Hoist, they had a few albums under their belt and had learned how to keep it concise; but they don't shy away from testing your boundaries too -- especially with the opus ""Demand"" that winds down a dangerous ten minute road. Unfortunately it doesn't get better after this one, so if you're only gonna get one Phish album, make it ""Hoist."" Big fun awaits you."
4,Alright,"this is an ok album. Any phish album cannot receive lower than 4 stars, but this one deserves it. Best songs: DWD, Saple in a Jar, Axila pt II"
4,A band in the making,"Hoist finds the boys at a very pleasant in-between stage. It is more defined and put together than thier earlier releases yet not quite up to par with what they have been putting out recently. The album contains classics such as Wolfman's Brother and Sample in a Jar, and also Down with Disease, which until recently was the bands only track that received any type of radio or video airplay. Basically, if you're a phan this album is a must, if not it's still an album that's worth what you pay for it."
5,good for a newbie,"For a newbie, this CD is a great way to ease into the world of Phish. While Junta is a better example of what Phish is really about, this CD is a fantastic selection of catchy songs that could bring anyone into being a phan. Newer fans might not enjoy some of the stranger, lenghty songs on other CDs so this album is perfect for newcomers. Ignore the comments from other fans of phish if you're a newbie. While they perform some of these songs much better in concert, the CD is still great and you won't be let down when you hear them in concert. Phans might stay away, but newbies should flock to this one."
4,"Very commercial, but very good.","This is, by far, Phish's most commercial release. Songs like ""Down With Disease,"" and ""Sample in a Jar"" really lend themselves to radio play. However, they still throw in a few songs for phans, like Demand."
3,One of their less memorable discs,"Not terrible, but for Phish's standards this is pretty low on the totem pole. We all saw how catchy, more typical song structures crept into their seemingly never-ending complexities over the years, but not until Hoist has the fire been dimmed to such a point that the inertia sounds palpable. Hoist is the bitter comedown to APoN's masterful assimilations."
3,Good not great,"Not a bad Phish studio album, but I can think of live versions of every one of these songs that I like better. Still, it brings back lots of memories from that time (early nineties). Clever songwriting, strong musicianship, but lacks the live dynamic."
1,Not worth it,"I tried using this stylus, but found it pretty much worthless. You have to press quite hard, and the tip is rather blunt, so you don't get much precision. I just threw it away after a few days."
4,Awesome,Book contains a lot of hymns from my grandmother's childhood. She loved the book although it does not contain the song she was looking for. She recommends it for anyone looking for old hymns that are not included within the Baptist Hymnal.
1,Lousy glasses,"These glasses - the yellow and the grayish - hurt when worn as they do not fit around the ear and I'm a standard size: 5'10"", 165. Other critics have said this and they are right. Do not buy these or even take them as a gift. They are useless."
4,a great gift,I bought this for my mother and mother-in-law.They both loved it and they look high-end earings.The only thing I didn't know and I didn't like was they are heavy and it shows when you are wearing them.
2,CHEAP LOOKING!!,I ordered these as a gift they looked so pretty online and they got good reviews so I decided to purchase them. BIG mistake!! They are very cheap looking. I realize I didn't pay that much for them but I could have Bought a $5 pair and they would've looked nicer!! You can tell on the earrings where the stone has been molded into the other part of the earring...absolutely horrible!! The reviews for it have to be fake! I have learned my lesson not to buy jewelry online.
4,These are pretty!,"I wear these a lot and I just love how they look on me. They show up on me real well,they are bright and shinny."
4,Pretty,Very Nice earrings for the price. They have a little of that authentic look to them which I love. I bought these for my mom for christmas and she loves them. Very Pretty!
3,Small but Cute,"These earrings are smaller than I thought they would be. They look very beautiful when you look at them from far away, but up close they look sloppy. They have a lot of scratches from production that were just polished over instead of being sanded out. Also, one of the earrings dangles in an odd, off center kind of way. Since they were so inexpensive, I am going to keep them and I'll wear them when I see grandma, since she can't see that well. :)"
5,My New Favorites!,These earrings are beautiful and I plan on purchasing the necklace that goes with them. They were received promtly and in excellant condition.
4,Expectation,"Hi, I ordered the cute little mushroom ring for my daughter and she loved it! It was everything that was expected and the quality is good. I would recommend the item and the Company to anyone!R - in NC"
5,This CD is great,I go this CD from a store and I love it. I like every sond on this disc. I would recommend it to anyone. Just be listen to '2000' and you will love Puba!
5,Most Awesome Artist in The World,"Fr. Stan Fortuna has a way with touching you through his music and words. I recently met Fr. Stan and he is awesome. The cd will make you think, it is not like the usual rap music. The messages he displays through his songs touch you, both in the heart and soul. I love you Fr. Stan"
2,Hard to use,"Please know that when you cross stitch one of these designs, the most help by way of a color photo or chart will be what's on the cover. The designs are a little tired and haven't aged well since the '80's."
1,Steer clear,My iPod will no longer work even when plugged in. I've learned since this purchase that car charging devices will ruin an iPod battery. As you know iPod batteries can not be replaced. At least not the version I have. Find another way to play you tunes in the car.
1,Terrible - A total disappointment,"I bought this because it was supposed to be so much better than the Belkin model. ""The best transmitter Apple's ever seen"" yadda yadda. Frankly, it's absolutely not worth the money at all (and wayyyy over-priced). I hate to say it but it's pretty much useless. Constant static. Constantly switching stations only to find more static. I actually returned the first one I bought because Monster tech support said it was probably defective. They sent me a second for free and it soudned exactly the same. Completely useless."
4,This purchase is good,"The sound with this cable is good, but i'm think that was better. However is good if you don't have any posibility to ear in your card your music."
3,Works great when it works.,"We travelled from San Diego to Yosemite using this Monster Cable a-IP-FM-CH iCarPlay Wifeless FM Transmitter for my iPod. It worked great through LA, and about 100 miles up the I5. The rest of the trip did not have any open stations. Older models of this transmitter would allow you to override the pre-selected stations if needed. I did not see this capability on my model. We could not use our iPod at all about 200 miles around Yosemite."
3,Monster ICarPlay,"This is the first ""extra"" I've purchased for my new Ipod, and it's somewhat disappointing. Sound quality varies from pretty good to bad depending on where I am at, and switching channels doesn't seem to help."
4,Great...Minor Criticism,"I bought this one...so I really have nothing else to compare it to. It works good. Supplies power to my iPod Nano while charging at the same time. I have one preset station that I use continously. This station (without this transmitter plugged in) emits a radion station pretty poorly. When the transmitter is plugged in, I rarely hear the other station (usually hear it only when i drive by the radion station on the other side of town). Some static is heard in certain conditions. Overall impression is pretty good. I'd be interested in testing out the iTrip...but I think I made the right choice here."
5,A Real Home Run!,"I purchased the Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter for iPod for a long vacation road trip. It arrived the day before I left, so my first experience using it was heading east on I-40 in heavy traffic. It was a snap! The only problem was seeing the preset FM station numbers on the iCarPlay. Once I stopped to refuel and set the second bank of FM presets on my radio to match those on the iCarPlay, all was well. I traveled nearly 2000 miles through both urban and rural areas and never had a problem finding a clear frequency. Using the presets on the iCarPlay and my radio made the search quick and painless. This is an excellent addition to the iPod for those who want to listen while traveling."
2,Not compatible with iPod Touch 2nd Gen,"Followed directions for using the cable. Upon connecting it to my iPod Touch 2nd Gen, the iPod displayed a message that the unit could not be charged. I called Monster and they said Apple revised the interface and I needed to purchase the Monster iCarPlay Wireless 250 instead if I wanted my iPod to charge using the FM transmitter. Will now be going to get this other unit."
2,if this is the best I'd hate to hear the worst,"I tried this in both of my vehicles and the ""hiss"" is to much for me to handle. At times it sounds great then it gets overtaken by the hiss for no apparent reason. This can happen just sitting in the driveway without the vehicle running. I bought this becuase it was a charger and FM transmitter in one which is a great feature. But it sounds like I will be going to the cassette adapter for better sound quality."
1,Not practical in big cities,"I bought this to play my ipod through the car stereo system. I live in the LA area which has many radio stations even at the lower frequencies. It was difficult to find a signal that consistently worked. And even when we were in an area where we could use the frequency, the sound quality wasn't that great. I ended up returning the transmitter and buying the $20 Sony tape adapter that you can use with regular portable cd players. It works great."
2,useless around san francisco,"Just got the iCarPlay yesterday, and I am already ready to return it. I am sure it is a great idea if you live in the middle of nowhere, but in San Francisco there are radio station on almost every channel and you have to change frequency every 5 minutes.I thought I could use it for my commute to work, but I end up spending way to much time making sure I have a clear signal...I am returing it."
1,Beware: I wanted the 8 stations one and got the 3 stations transmitter!,"I purcharsed the Monster iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod from TheFactoryDepot thinking it was going to be an 8 FM radio stations transmitter (as pictured) and I got the 3 radio stations one and it won't work on the city I live, which I knew already before buying them! I couldn't return these (I bought 2!!!) because I live out of the country and it would be painful so decided to keep them...I used the 8 FM radio stations, charger transmitter before and it works great! I live in a big city and I may only use it on one but it works great! I'm sure the 3 stations one would work just fine for someone who lives in a small town and doesn't travel much. I used the Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod before too and it doesn't get good enough signal, it would always have noise on the sound.I hope this helps and that you don't get the wrong product too!"
1,What a piece of SH!T,"It used to be that the solution for questionable engine noises was to TURN THE STEREO UP.Well, the excess white noise broadcasted from this bad boy oughta' do it! Of course, good luck in actually enjoying your ipod throught it! Christ...It'll mask that out for ya too! WHAT A JOKE...WHAT HAPPENED TO APPLE'S INTEGRITY???...TO EVEN HAVE THIER PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH JUNK!!!I'VE TRIED 2 DIFFERENT MODELS OF MONSTER'S TRANSMITTERS.THE GOOD NEWS IS... THEY BOTH SUCKED EQUALLY!! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!ANYONE WISH TO DEBATE??????????"
2,The monster has no teeth,"For a company with a sterling reputation like Monster Cable, I would have expected a better engineered, more well-designed product. First off, the device is manufactured out of cheap lightweight plastic that feels as if it could disintegrate in your hand. The design is interesting, but in no way attempts to blend in with the iPod's form factor. Although the charging and power supply aspect work fine, the transmitter sounds terrible on my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee's factory installed FM receiver. The audio output is weak and has much static, which worsens in heavily urban areas--when driving in San Francisco, for instance, the device is utterly useless. This is perhaps exacerbated by the fact that the transmitter only offers six possible output frequencies at the low end of the FM spectrum. Other units have an unlimited selection of output frequencies that could potentially work better in cars like mine. Try one of them instead."
5,FAST AND FURIOUSLY EASY,"Oh I love this !! I got it in the mail yesterday and used it this morning on my 40 mile treck to work and it was wonderful!! The hookup and scanning was automatic and so very user friendly. What a dream and the connection and all was great and as always with this company the looks and style and quality is always there. That is why I went with Monster Cable to begin with. The cost may be a little bit more but who wants to monkey around with junk after all you bought an ""Ipod"" .Great!"
2,worked well until the ipod connector broke,"I purchased one of these about a year and a half ago and liked it -- it was easy to use and I could find a static free empty frequency in Tucson although I did have some challanges with changing frequencies and static in the Phoenix area (not the transmitter's fault).Just recently the plastic split casing of the FM transmitter's cable that connects to the iPod just split apart and disintegrated -- unable to put back together. The connector has never been mistreated or stepped on. It still works, but to use it would leave exposed wires etc out and it won't lock into the iPod without the connector shell piece.I'll probably replace with a new model of Monster's transmitter since it did work well.So for this one I'd have to give Monster 2 stars (4-5 stars for the function of FM transmitter and 1 star for the lack of quality of the cable connector)."
5,Nice investment,"I had heard good things about the Monster iCarPlay and I have to say that it lived up to the hype. The cable worked perfectly on our 10 hour road trip to our vacation. I loaded my ipod with music and podcasts and just turned it on and it kept us entertained for hours. Great product, easy to use and not only did it allow us to take our ipod on the road, it charged it too!"
3,Good signal... when you can get it.,"I live in central New Jersey, which counts as both the suburbs for New York City and Philadelphia. You can imagine then, that our airwaves are pretty clogged up. Commuting from New Brunswick to Princeton, as I do, I find that I constantly have to change channels on my transmitter -- and my car stereo -- just to eliminate the static. Visiting upstate New York, however, there was absolutely no problem. My iPod came in loud and clear. This is definitely something to consider when buying any FM transmitter, though it's my understanding that this is the best of the bunch. So I'd recommend it, but only if you live in an area with minimal radio interference. In that case, go with the cassette adapter (if you can) or see about getting it hooked into the auxilary input."
3,Not the best!,"Buyer beware!After 3 days of use the FM Modulator went out, only got static on my radios. Sent unit back to Monster and haven't heard another word from them.When it was working it was great for what it is, not perfect, but you could select any open channel in the spectrum as well as the fixed chanels within the unit and it did charge my iPod. I imagine there are some good units out there but this is the problem I had with this model. You get what you pay for."
4,The best I have used,"This works very good, It can be a little fuzzy at times, but 99% of the time it works GREAT!! It is much better than any other reciever that I have used or seen!!"
1,"Great idea, poor execution","I was very excited when this product arrived in the mail, and horribly disappointed when I got it into my car. It has several key things that make this product a failure for me, at least.1- only 3 stations to choose from, where I thought I'd be able to scan like with other FM transmitters2- very difficult to disconnect from the ipod3- WON'T CHARGE the Ipod Touch. My Ipod just says that this accessory is not compatible for charging. (and this was the whole reason I bought the device. I was tired of my Ipod battery dying while riding in the car, and thought this would be the best solution)The plus sides? It has decent sound quality, and no need to replace batteries all the time in the fm transmitter. that's about it. I think I'll do some more shopping around for one that actually works for my device and use this if needed in a pinch."
1,Too much static on every station...SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I live in the suburbs of Long Island, NY and there is constant static on each of the iCarplay's alloted stations.Even when I drive to the Delaware Water Gap, passing through rural NJ farmland, there is constant static on each of the iCarplay's alloted stations."
2,Doesn't charge iPod touch,Sound can be a little fuzzy at times but I bought this thinking that it was a charger and a transmitter but when I actually used it I was not able to charge my iPod touch.
4,Just what i wanted!,"I love this little thing. It works great. My only complaint is that there are only a few radio stations that it can work with. It has a nice, clear sound and strong signal otherwise."
2,Static on every channel in urban areas...,"While this device was well intended, the limited tuner frequencies poses a problem in urban areas with many stations.I wasn't able to find a station that was crosstalk-free in Seattle or the San Jose Bay Area. The charger worked well, but ultimately I'm MUCH happier with a car charger and the Griffin iTrip."
1,Worthless to me,"How well this works must depend a lot on your car and where you live. I have a 2003 Accord and live in the suburbs of a mid-sized city, and this is useless. I could only get a signal from it for 2 of the channels, and it was very faint and full of static. I returned it."
2,Not Worth the Money,It gets awful reception. I got better reception with a transmitter that came as a freebie with my iPod!
4,Works great for me.,"After reading all the comments, I was worried about ordering this. Luckily my desire to use my iPod in my car and a friend who had one advice, I ordered it.The instructions say find a station with little or no signal. In my area 88.1, has a station with an excellent signal... I plugged in the Monster iCarPlay and there was no bleed over. My iPod played very well. There was a little static, and I noticed on one track I could hear the same hiss and crackle that I hear when playing it on my CD player.It was definitely worth the money."
2,Weak Transmitter,"It worked as stated, but occasionally static is heard. This occurred on all pre-set FM stations. I think the transmitter needs to be stronger or some other solution is needed to avoid static."
1,Killed my 30gb Ipod Photo,Worked well for a month. Then one day I connected it and my Ipod shut off completely. I unconnected and Ipod still wouldnt turn on. I looked at the dock connector and it was black on the IPOD and on the cable.
4,Better than i could have imagined,"I read alot of problems with FM transmitters, but that Monster had the best of them. I fully expected to have some degree of interference in the NYC area. I was totally shocked to find out how well this porduct works. Of course there is a small amount of static that jumps in and out, although infrequently. Also, the bass does not sound as good.Bottom line, however, this product works great in my BMW. I heard from other BMW owners that Monster is the way to go."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"I bought this for my new video iPod to listen to it in my car (a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix). I bought it because several friends SWORE it was the best FM transmitter I could use with my iPod. No, it's not! It has 10-preset station choices. The reception was not satisfactory. I was always hearing static or interference on any choice.I am returning this item to Amazon. I purchased the Griffin Road Trip from Circuit City instead, and I'm much more satisfied with it. I get crystal clear iPod sound 95% of the time with it, so I'd strongly encourage you to spend the extra money!"
1,RATHER CARRY CDS !!!,"THIS FORM OF MUSIC TRANSFER TO CAR RADIO IS WEAK AT BEST. IF YOU LIVE IN URBAN AREA FORGET TRYING TO USE IF YOU WANT CLEAN QUALITY SOUND. ALL CHANNELS ARE FILLED WITH STATIC OR DISTORTION. THE OTHER ISSUE IS OVERALL SIGNAL IS AT A LOW VOLUME LEVEL. THIS REQUIRES GAINING VOLUME ON RADIO INCREASING BACKROUND AMBIENT ""FM"" SIGNAL NOISE. VERY DISAPOINTED !!! "" I WOULD RATHER CARRY CDS AND PLAY DIRECT"
1,monster cable for ipod,Disappointed in the quality of the cable because you ahve to physically hold the cable in in order for the ipod to play the music!
1,Unsatisfactory product for my car (BMW),"I purchased this device to play my Ipod in my car (a BMW M5). The reception was really terrible. Not recommended, at least if you have a 5 series BMW. Apparently the car antenna and this device don't talk to well to each other, despite the positive comments from other reviewers."
3,Still waiting for refund of this product,"Item worked fine,but it is NOT wireless as advertised.It doesn't compare to the Griffin FM transmitter,which by the way IS wireless and therefore much easier to use.Plus,it sounds a whole lot better,too.P.S.: I am STILL waiting for my refund for this particular item.It's been several weeks and I still haven't received anything.What's going on?Please,let me know ASAP.............Thank you"
3,"Great technology, sketchy construction","Monster cables have a great reputation and I needed a way to take my iPod on long car trips. It works great when plugged in, perfect clear signal, easy to adjust. However, I have trouble plugging and unplugging it in the car lighter, and even worse the plug into the iPod almost refuses to release. I have to press really really hard on the release buttons and yank to get the cord out of my iPod. This is a problem since I take my iPod with me every time I get out of the car. In short, they need to work on the details a little. I'm definitely keeping it, but also definitely keeping the warranty and return info."
2,NOW AND THEN,"This is a neat thing and it works as long as I am not in Chicago or near Chicago or driving through the suburbs around Chicago. Unfortunately, this is where I LIVE, and so this is where I am trying to use this. So far there are no un-used FM stations that are reliably un-used! So it may work for a half hour or it may not work at all, or....whatever. Very disappointing since this is the area I will be traveling where I would want to use it. Nothing diminishes road rage quite like listening to Jimmy Buffett."
1,VERY disappointed,"When I first recieved this item, it functioned ""OK"". It worked every now and then. Lots of static and interruption. After having it only about a month or so, it started to fall apart... literally. All of the pieces came unglued and the item was forever destroyed. I had high hopes, but it turned out that it was just another cheaply-made transmitter. Not worth the $60 I paid. Very disappointed."
2,A lot of static !!!,"I have been using this transmitter for more than 6 months. I live in the Los Angeles area and lately, I have been getting a lot of static while using the transmitter. The pre-set stations of 8 are definitely not adequate. I hear so much static that I can barely listen to the music. Really annoying! Would not recommend this transmitter, since its forcing me to buy another FM transmitter."
3,Inconsistent Performance,"In theory, this is a great product. It does vary in performance GREATLY depending on the car you use it in, and the geographic location.The charging is great - listen to your IPod all you want in the car, the battery gets charged, who can ask for more?Me.The sound quality of the FM transmitter is very inconsistent. Im my car, and in a brand new rental car that I tried it in, I got a lot of static, especially when the music volume was relatively low. In my wife's car, almost no static at all. Go figure.Also, geographically, in radio dense areas - I get more static. On a drive in the berkshires, none at all - clean reception.so not to confuse - I still think the product is good. I just wish it was more consistent, and that the FM transmitter was not limited to 8 frequencies, which in dense areas almost guarantees static..."
2,Too Much STATIC!!!,I live about 30 miles south of Indianapolis and no matter what channel I select there is static! The quality of the sound is very poor. I'm now looking to somehow hardwire my ipod into my car. My advice is pass on this one unless you don't mind constant static.
5,WONDERFUL THING,"MONSTER ROCKS ! I have been thru 3 other iPod to FM devices of other brands and they all sucked, I used them a few times and gave up for one reason or other: Too weak a signal , Too many wires etc they were just not worth the hassle. Now at last I have my ALL my music in the car. This produck works really well is simple & elegant. I DO wish they had configured the cord length a bit differently but then every car is going to be different, maybe if they used plugs and you could swap the location of the sender unit ? NOW I need a male Firewire to new iPod dock adapter so I can use my old school iPod in the car too.I AM A CITIZEN OF BLACK ROCK CITY AND I WANT TO GO HOME !"
4,Best Value of the FM Transmitters,"I've done a lot of research and agonized over which of these FM Transmitters to buy for my iPod before finally buying the Monster version, and I am completely satisfied. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for something that doesn't work great. I'm convinced that this is the best valued of these transmitters because it works well with near CD quality and you can get it for under $50. I took a 6 hour car trip right after buying this product and it worked beautifully. I had to change stations a couple of times during the trip, but never had a problem finding a clear station to use. It's also easy to use and it charges my iPod quickly. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because of occasional static in a very radio station busy Washington D.C. area. However, it works nicely for what I need it to do, so I'm a happy camper. And, just so you don't think I only write good reviews on Amazon, I'm off to write a bad review next."
5,"Great buy, great transmitter","I recently purchased an iPod Nano, and read a few reviews of the iTrip Nano and purchased that first. Huge mistake as the reception was pathetic and after tweaking it for a few days I just could not live with it. A good friend of mine had the iCarplay and it worked well for him so i purchased it here as with the new one out this trasmitter is a great buy. Plugged it in, and EVERY station that i tried works fantastic even if there is a strong signal on that station from the radio broadcast. I live outside of Philadelphia and the radio stations are packed but this item works like a charm. I love it and highly recommend it. Sound quality is not that of a CD but for how simple it is to use and it charges your ipod you cannot go wrong. 5 stars from me."
5,PHOENIX Rocks with the iCarPlay!,"I LOVE IT! It took less than two minutes to set up, including time to rip open package, tune it and the radio to 88.7fm in Phoenix, AZ and presto -- Its the most wonderful time of the year and I'm blasting holiday tunes in my car that sound better than the local radio stations. The only thing I had to get used to is not wrapping the cord around my drive shaft!! Just a little patience solved that one."
3,Check the left side of your FM Dial before ordering.,"Before you order this, check the frequencies 88.1,88.3,88.5,88.7,88.9,89.1,89.3,89.5,89.7 and 89.9 on your car's radio in the area you plan to use this. If you have anything more than light static, you won't be happy with the sound due to other interference. If you can find a clear channel, then the sound is OK.The LED indicator is fine in daylight, but it's hard to see the frequency markings on the device at night."
1,Useless with iPod Touch V2,This thing is worthless to me. It won't charge the battery on my iPod Touch and the sound is terrible.Good thing it was cheap.
4,monster icar,actually i was unsure about this product ive read mixed reviews but i really love it the sound quality is awsome
3,better than others but still sucks,"I live in nyc and i tried a couple of other fm transmitters that were horrible, although this one is better it still works like crap. Lots of static and it just doesnt work well. Im actually buying a tape adaptor which by reviews states works better and is like 45 bucks cheaper!!! so i dont recomment it."
1,Junk,"This is possibly the most frustrating piece of junk ever sold. I bought this for a long road trip, and believe me, by the end of the first day, we were ready to run over it, put the car into reverse, back over it again, and repeat. Not only will you constantly be switching FM stations, but the interference and white noise will drive you completely bats. The problem is that in most locations 90% of these frequencies are being used by other stations, so the iPod signal fades in and out. Either get some portable speakers or buy the cassette adapter.Conclusion: Monstrously Irritating and Annoying"
2,Not enough frequency choices,"I live in Los Angeles and find that the none of the preset frequencies work well. There are many radio stations in this city. For crowded radio areas like LA, you'd be better off with transmitters that allow the full FM spectrum to choose from, such as the iCarPlay Plus.On the good side, the product looks great and I love the how everything is integrated into the compact design."
1,Too much interference,"I live in Southern California and gave this product a good try, adjusting everything I could to get good sound. I wanted this to work. (I have a 2002 Subaru Outback VDC with a McIntosh sound system.) There was way too much interference. In the quieter parts of music I could hear static, and in the louder parts the sound was muddy."
4,Great 4 your iPod,"I bought this product because my 2006 Tacoma did not have an IPod input. I wanted to listen to my IPod in my car and didn't want to buy a new stereo deck where I wanted the factory look and was low on cash. $50.00 for this transmitter is worth the money. I don't get too much static; however, there are times when it does get static and gets annoying. I recommend this product."
5,Great FM transmitter & Charger!,"This transmitter and charger works great! I bought this transmitter last year for my daughter. Her boyfriend liked hers so much, he asked for one for Christmas. It is very easy to use and works very well."
4,Decent Product,"Not outstanding, but not horrible. It does what I expected, but it doesn't blow my hair back. I think it was worth the money I paid for it, I would buy it again if I had it to do all over."
3,It's okay - but not worth the money,"Alright, so I bought the video iPod and then I needed an adapter for those rental cars that don't have tape players, so I bought this.The sound quality is average at best and if your car has an antenna in the back of your car then you won't get any reception. It feeds off the antenna - so if you buy this, make sure the antenna is on the front of your car.I thought my iTrip was better than this but it won't work with the iPod video."
2,Disappointing Sound,"I was bummed to find that no matter what channel I tuned the iCarPlay to, the sound was quite static-y. For anything but very loud music, it's intolerable. Since some people seem not to have this experience, I suspect that it has a lot to do with the quality of the FM tuner in the car in which it's used (some are inherently better at tuning in weak stations, rejecting the weaker of two ""competing"" stations, etc.). I'm returning the iCarPlay, and springing for a deck with an auxiliary input for my iPod."
3,Its not as good as they say,"I got this as a gift for Xmas and it says that its also a charger and it doesnt charge my ipod at all. And when trying to listen to music it sounds like im listening to an AM station. And sometimes even sounds staticky. When it works it works ok. But not as I expected. And since it was a gift and I already threw out the packaging I probably wont be able to get it replaced.can someone tell meif this is compatible with the 2nds generation ipod. The new ""RED"" one. Maybe that could be the reason."
5,Awesome Transmitter!!! Way to go Monster.,I purchased the Monster FM Transmitter for my wife for christmas. Once i installed it in the car and plugged her Ipod Nano to it the real magic began. This transmitter has EXCELLENT reception and sounds great. I would HIGHLY recommend this MONSTER FM Transmitter to anyone looking for the BEST transmitter money can buy. This product will not let you down.
1,A Major Disappointment,"Had I written this review in the first 2-3 weeks of owning this iCarPlay, I would have given it full stars. HOWEVER, 4 weeks into it, this Monster Monstrocity has deceided that it will only play for about 15-20 minutes at a time. The light in the power plug end remains lit, but all lights on the transmitter itself go out along with the sound. It must rest for awhile before it feels ready to work again. It must have a union contract!"
3,Works okay for what it is - the design doesn't work great in my car,"First of all, having had another FM transmitter (the airplay), this one seems to work much better. There is still some distortion that comes with the technology but it meets the need for long road trips (I rarely use it for around the town driving). I have to believe that using the car as a power source probably helps in the strength of the signal.The part of the design that is a little annoying is that the plug end has a large button feature with the Monster M logo on it. This feature makes it a little difficult to work in the family car (VW passat wagon). That car's lighter is reset within the ashtray and because of the diameter of the button feature being so large, I have to force the ashtray one way while biasing the plug in the opposite direction (it makes me a little nervous that I will eventually break the ashtray housing). I may have to take a file to it to give a little more clearance."
1,Don't Believe Them!!,"Any reviewer who claims to live in an urban area and says he gets great results from this product is LYING. Beware of retailers or manufacturers submitting reviews. I live in the NY area. Every possible bandwith is occupied. This solution does not and cannot work. Even in a rural area, where a response is possible, the sound is brutal! Worse than AM radio. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. I'm bringing mine back. I now believe that a hard wired approach is the ONLY workable solution. Reviewers who say this sounds great must still have 8 track players."
4,so far so good,I purchased this product for my son as a gift. So far he has had no problems and he is enjoying the product.
1,Nothing but static,"Even in the least populated areas of North America (Canada), I got mainly static. I have a 2004 Toyota Sienna with a standard manufacturer's radio/DVD player.Very frustrating and a waste of money."
2,Poor Audio Quality due to Constant FM Interference,"I live in LA and have been using the Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter for iPod in my Ford Explorer for several weeks now, and have decided that the it is not usable. On the good side, it is a nice compact, integrated design that keeps your iPod charged while in the car. On the bad side, it only has eight FM frequencies to choose from, and here in LA and Orange Counties, that's just not enough. I travel from Irvine to the South Bay to Santa Monica, and I would constantly hear a hiss or other annoying interference. Worse, as I move from one part of two to another, I have to fumble with the iCarPlay and my car radio to switch them to a new frequency. And this doesn't seem to be a problem just here in LA and Orange County; the interference is prevalent at nearly all times when traveling down I-5 to San Diego. So, for populated areas, I cannot recommend the iCarPlay."
4,Great player - Even works on newer iPods (except charging),"This is a great iPod player for one's car. I used it with my 5th generation 30 GB iPod and it sounded great, as well as charged nicely. The reception on the channels that it uses comes through just fine, even if that channel has a lot of chatter regularly.After purchasing a newer iPod (5th generation Nano) it still works great for listening, but does not charge the iPod. With the battery life of newer iPods getting longer and longer, I don't find this to be much of a problem. I would still recommend this due to it's price for quality of sound, which I think is most important in a player anyway."
1,Unreliable and lots of static - other channels seem to always cut in.,"I tried this in several different cars and in several different locations. Urban settings, it's nearly useless as every other radio signal within 60 miles is going to be stronger. Not bad on the turnpikes when you get away from cities. And best if you're in the absolute middle of no where (north woods Wisconsin, extremely isolated)...but even then it still has a lot more static than described. I wouldn't buy this again. I'd try to figure something out with either a headphone jack, a usb, or if your car's on the older side, one of those cassette adapter things that you plug in and it plays off your cassette player. This item just doesn't work well."
4,am/fm adaptor for ipod,"The item was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. However, even after doing my research, this item did not charge my ipod as suggested. Maybe my ipod was too old?"
3,No good for Colorado Front Range,Terrible experience beyond the garage. There are very few frequencies to choose from in the Denver metro area and possibly not as good with Honda Civic.
2,Rarely Works,In the few areas where one of the FM Bands is open it woks great. I live in the SF Bay Area and I have interference on every frequencey at some point in my commute. I also drive I-5 to LA all the time and can't go more than thirty miles without having to change frequency.
1,Don't buy if you live in NYC,This product has basically been relegated to an in-car charger for me. I mostly have a very difficult to impossible time finding a clear channel in the the new york city area despite the fact you get 10 to choose from. I bought a cheap cassette adapter and it works infinitely better. The iCarPlay now just keeps my iPod charged on long trips.
2,H20music,"If you like the sound Quality of your ipod degraded 30 to 40 %, then this is the item for you. The signal is not clear, there is static on all bands and the tone is basically marginal. Save your money!"
3,"nice to have, but the audio quality is really shaky","I set my radio's second set of FM preset buttons to the first six available settings on the transmitter -- that saves me a lot of time if I need to switch off an occupied channel. Here on the East Coast, most of the frequencies this unit offers are in use somewhere.-Overall the unit functions just fine. But as other reviewers pointed out before I bought the unit, it is coming across the FM frequency band and quality would degrade. Well, they were right. Still, I use it and am able to hear many more podcasts since I have an hour commute in both the morning and evening. So I am getting use out of it, but I don't like listening to music on it .. the quality really does suffer."
2,Later versions are a better selection,The product works effectively when one of the eight or so FM stns are open...otherwise you receive screeching noises and other disconcerting sounds. It is my understanding that later versions enable you to select ANY open FM stn/number (i.e. 87.9 always seems to be open but I can't select that stn with my current pdt)...
4,DAVE BRUBECK BEYOND TAKE FIVE,"A masterful composer and arranger, Dave Brubeck is a national treasure and this work goes beyond jazz to the genre of classical spiritual music.The entire CD is a powerful piece of music from an icon in American music. Highly recommended."
2,Lackluster Effort,"I was very disappointed in this CD. This piece in no way compares with Brubeck's ""Gates of Justice"", which is spectacular. There are a few worthwhile moments for the soloists, but for the most part, the writing is uninspired."
2,Sepia Maxi Single,"This Maxi CD shows a differend kind of DEEN. They change their music style, and use diferent instruments. But, it is a must own for a DBGT fan, that includes 'Hitori Janai (Bossa Nova Style)' although not the kind of style a DB fan would of expected. This CD includes 'Miraino tameni (Sing Along Version)' 'Koibitoya, Yumemo Usomo Subete' and 'Akizakura ~more&more~' with 2 special versions. This CD must be added to your collection, only if you are a real DEEN fan!"
4,"Economic ""bombs"" and religious response","This book is a brief but comprehensive review of religious reponse in the United States to the Great Depression. Church membership and attendance, the clergy, and various programs and activities are covered. Of special interest to some will be the overview of regional and rural variations. The principal sectarian focus in on Protestants but some attention is given to Roman Catholics and Jews as well. Appendix C briefly touches on similar conditions and responses in Quebec."
1,Does not match the photo!,"I bought this hat because it appeared to have a stiff brim from the photo. It has a floppy brim! Very nice color scheme, so I kept the hat."
2,"ok, but not worth it","I recently took a Maya class where we learned how to do most stuff in this book. When I got this book for free, I decided to go through it step by step just for the hell of it.I got lost. Half the stuff they told me to do did not work and I followed it step by step. There are lots of pictures, but where I went wrong, there were no pictures. I does not do a good job of explaining why it tells you to do things which is a major point in my book. I would suggest looking elsewhere for modeling.The only good part of this book is learning one or two things teachers never bothered to tell you like merging verts after checking normals.(...)"
4,good modeling book for starting off,"This book is good for those who know very little about Maya. I prefer another book, the Maya Bible 4.5 which includes more tuturials and more advanced modeling. Don't get discouraged but the 4.5 it still applies to many of the functions of Maya 6. The disk that is provided with this book is nice, giving you the ability to see some real life maya using."
4,Decked Out,Good coverage of the art of skateboard decks with most of the major designers included. Excellent interviews with the designers themselves and their approach to their work.Recommended reading to any collector of this art form.
2,HMMM...,"SPIKE JONZE DOES NOT OWN GIRL SKATEBOARDS. Unless there was a recent development, Girl is a company started and owned by a certain Rick Howard, professional skateboarder. I would , however, recommend all of his Spike's Girl skateboards videos, especially MOUSE, which along with Welcome tko Hell, formed a special period in the short history of skateboarding. This book has nothing to do with the artform I grew up with, (im 20) in the sense that skateboarding is something to be experienced first... reminisced about later, and the objects of inquiry are themselves, not that interesting or complicated."
1,bogus,"are you kidding? MTV put out a book on skate art? don't even read any further, don't even think of getting this piece of junk. Look further and you will find something better for sure."
3,Decent keyboard cover,"This keyboard cover is decent, but it's not that great. My sister has a keyboard cover for her Mac, and it looks almost invisible! On this one, you can tell that it's there, and it attracts dust too."
3,fugly,"Its ugly but it does whats it designed to do. It makes it kind of hard to hit the keys and you cant see what key you are hitting. If it were clear and thinner, i'd make this 5 stars."
4,My Opinion Good Product!,"I haven't been keeping specific track of this product, but I think it works! I have had difficulty loosing weight, for all kinds of reasons, and this product provided the incentive to keep going. I have reached a plateau right now, but that is only because I use two tablets a day and can't exercise everyday. However, I am going to continue using it and hopefully see some more results with exercising more too!"
3,Maybe it will work for you.,"I was actually taking the slimquick ultra before I decided to try the extreme. This does nothing for me, I would highly recommend the slimquik ultra. I think it is better for unwanted weight. Also this pill gave me no extra energy at all."
1,GOT VIOENTLY ILL!!!!,"SLIMQUICK made me violently ill. I have thyroid disease and am on Zoloft (anti depression/anxiety pill). Even though I saw the warning label on the box about asking your doctor if you have these I figured it can't be that bad. Wow was I wrong I was violently throwing up and shaking for 8 hours and dehydrated=(. Four hours after that I was getting numb pains in my back and arms and chest pain, heart burn that would not go away. Finally now at 4am I feel starving and dazed but am Okay. Please DO NOT take this unless asking your doctor. This stuff seems pretty dangerous."
1,should not waste your money,"Slimquick sounds good,but it is to good to be true!!!! I took it for a little over a month and lost about 10lbs but I felt jittery and sick the whole time... kinda like I drank 10 cups of coffee all at once... that feeling of knowing that somethimg just is not right.... I keep thinking that the feeling would pass and my body would get use to taken slimquick... But over time I started feeling more jittery and sick my belly started feeling like it was on fire!!! I'm not taken slimquick anymore and Im happy to say thatall sickness and jitters are gone... But the weight did come right back on with a 2 weeks .... =("
1,Bleahhhh...yuck,"Wanting to get rid of about 15 pounds, I purchased this product intending to add a little boost to my workout routine and new diet. It says to take it in the morning when you first wake up, right before cardio, but I immediately felt so sick after taking it that I couldn't do any cardio. I continued to feel sick until well past noon that day. Tossed it in the trash, fast weight loss is not worth feeling crappy all day."
1,Stay away . . .,"I took these pills for two weeks with no results besides feeling a little jittery and sick. It was strange that I didn't loose weight because I greatly reduced my caloric intake and it is generally very easy for me to loose a couple of pounds when I need to. One night, out of the blue, I had a severe panic attack. I believe it to be caused by the SlimQuick Extreme so I stopped taking it immediately and all symptoms went away. Then my weight ballooned by 10 lbs. over the next month. My eating habits were very normal and healthy (vegetarian, tons of vegetables and fruit, almost no fat) but Slimquick destroyed my metabolism. Stay away."
2,slimquick did not work for me,"I purchased the slimquick diet supplement about a month ago. I felt that it did not work for me. No energy boost, it just made my head feel funny."
1,don't do it!,this product does not work at all! It actually made me more hungy... Don't waste ur money on this!
2,Not practical,I didn't relize when i ordered that the amounts and times that they recommend would be unpractical.
2,Save your money,This does reduce my appetite but it also makes my stomach burn. Do not take it after 4pm or you will be up all night. I am not someone usually affected by caffeine but this kept me up. Get off your butt and move and eat healthier and you will see better results.
2,BE CAREFUL,"I needed to loose 2 1/2 inches in 8 weeks to fit into my wedding dress and this product was recomended to me. If I took the full dosage I would get sick and light headed, so I took only half the dosage, usally 3 in the morning with a high protien meal. It worked, I lost almost all of the weight. I stopped taking it on my wedding day and then I ballooned up. Its been only 3 weeks and I have gained all that weight back and then some. This is fustrating becauase I have maintained my high protien, low fat diet.If you are looking for a quick temporary wight loss solution this works but be carful about your dosage."
2,A quick let down,"Ok so I bought this product for two reasons, the first being energy for my p90x workouts, and the second an appetite surpresent. I am not over weight so I didnt purchase this product for weight loss all though it would'nt be a bad bonus. I use to take hydroxycut hardcore but once it was taken off the market I didnt want to purchase the reinvented version because I doubt it is anything like the orginal, so i went with the good reviews on slimquick extreme and got this. I used it for 2 weeks and the only thing it really did for me was make me sweat and make me super jittery. I didnt get the energy i was looking for and I actually got even hungrier, so I love amazon and the feedback( thats what i base my purchases on ) but i guess whats good for one person isnt always good for everyone. So i only give this product 2 stars, but i guess your experience could be a better one!"
5,SCSI > USB2 for Iomega Jaz Drive,"This Adaptec product is true to the excellence of Adaptec. Easy to install, connect and use. My use was to connect older Iomega Jaz SCSI drives via USB to a new computer running XP. Instant and flawless, took no more than 3 minutes to be up and running . . . and that includes actually reading the directions which consist of 5 short paragraphs :-) If you need this for this purpose, don't hesitate."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"So this is supposedly a true story. I believe it is, but you'll have to decide that for yourself. The 2nd half of the book has the actual regression sessions which reiterates the story in the first half, but it's interesting to see the actual documentation of what happened. I think the topic is not only fascinating, but I really began to empathize with Raechel. Something about this book really affected me and resonated with me. Whether you believe the story to be true or not, the worst thing you can walk away with is an interesting few hours spent reading it."
2,Ho hum,The first part of this book was somewhat interesting but the part that had to do with recovered memories just didn't work for me.
2,poor book,"The cross-breed between entertainment novel and allegedly ""true story"" is a mishappen attempt. Most of the book is just smalltalk including ""reconstructed"" dialogs, that neither author actually overheard. The book is largely a bulk of bunk and bull.Sure I belive that something stange happened and in part two some shortcoming attempts to research the case are made as well, but the results are not very impressive."
3,Revolting And Vengeful...,"REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is a rather dull affair w/ Dean Jagger. The only real ""revolt"" doesn't happen until the end when the ""zombies"" kill their master. These are living people whose brains have been fried, NOT living dead flesh-munchers! VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES has Paul Naschy in another dual role (3 if you count the devil in the short dream sequence). Naschy is both a goody-goody mystic and his evil twin, who raises dead women from their graves in order to send them out to murder his enemies. These zombie babes look more like Manson gals! This double feature isn't very scary, but it's not a total waste..."
2,"Not funny at all, just gross.","Books like this one are meant to be funny time-killers. Unfortunately, this book is tedious, repetitive and not very funny. Even though it is quite slim and my commute is quite boring, I still cannot finish even half of it. Look elsewhere for better entertainment."
2,Briefly Interesting,"This book makes it sound like it would be a little more racy, but its rather prudish in its attitude toward habits and just about everything is 'offensive'. It's actually informative but not very entertaining, a decent coffee table book, but you probably won't find your self engrossed for more than 5 minutes."
4,2 out of 3...,Two out of the three tales of this book are excellent. The narration is keeping the reader with the book until the story ends. The plot is also genuine. I wish the first story was as good as the other two...But do not be misguided by the title. The stories are not set in an academic institution. Simply the heroes portayed in the stories are academics.
1,Crude and disappointing.,"I bought this book after loving The Lecturer's Tale, so I was almost angry after reading this mediocre and often crude collection of novellas. I expected so much more -- I felt almost cheated. I found most of the writing to be sloppy and sometimes puerile. I suppose I could go into detail as to why, but the short version is...I just didn't like it at all. I'm glad that I'd already read The Lecturer's Tale, because I would never have done so had I read this book first. Don't bother."
3,An interesting anthology topic.,"I haven't seen a collection of horror stories with a college proffessor theme before. It's always good to see new things. Like most collections, it has it's good points and it's bad points. The first and the third stories I liked, the middle one I could have done without. It was too ambiguous, and I don't like not knowing what happens next. I definitely thought it was worth reading, though."
4,If Poe Had a PhD.,"If Edgar Allen Poe were a junior faculty member in a highly political department, this might be the kind of collection he'd write. James Hynes takes the old adage ""publish or perish"" to its most extreme and literal conclusion in these three novellas. In all three stories, a character's quest for academic credibility puts him or her in peril. Also in all three stories, the postmodern juts up against traditional academia, sometimes with gruesome results.This is a fast read, perfect for the chilly nights of late fall when the wind howls `round the window frames and your motivation to grade those midterm finals is waning. And unless someone at work is actively planning your death, it'll make you feel better about your own department politics, whatever they may be."
4,"Scathing, funny, deliciously entertaining","What fun! Hynes skewers academia so piercingly that I laughed out loud while reading his novellas. Some of the characters--especially characters in the first and third novellas--are loathsome, and it was fun to see them get their comeuppance. Hynes portrayal of academic conferences is so on-target that those in the academy should squirm. His twist on Poe's stories was clever, especially the riff on The Black Cat. The Cask of Amontillado is hinted at in spots of the second novella, but the allusions are weaker. Good summertime reading for anyone missing life in the university."
5,great book - even if you're not into short stories,"This was a great book. I don't write reviews much, but this one was worth writing in about.The cat story had me looking at our cats in a different way for a few hours after I finished it. Apparently this author's sinister portrayal in the first story got to me a little."
2,Not what I hoped for.,"I found the characters in the book to be caricatures; and not very entertaining ones at that. The stories all smack of male mid-life crisis, a theme that rapidly becomes predictable. It is so easy to make fun of academics, but so hard to really wrestle with the contradictions of an intellectual life in a commercial culture. Plenty of easy satire here, but not much insight or true pathos."
5,Publish and Flourish,This collection of 3 interconnected novellas set in academia was a highly entertaining read. The felines creeping through the text were not all that earned this work a comparison to Poe. Suspenseful and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.
3,Entertaining. A good book for the beach!,"The book is entertaining, especially if you are familiar with academia at all. It is definitely a good beach book."
3,Jeri Sandal,"It is a beautiful shoe, it turned out to be a little too heavy for heavy walking, for out on the town, it's great, comfortable and very elegant."
5,Cute is great in some games,"When deciding to purchase this game, i came here, and read the reviews. All i can say is don't let the ""cuteness"" of this game fool you. It is an excellent adventure game, with challenging levels to test your skills.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the game really does exude cute, from Parin(the main character), to all her friends in the game. They are all well thought out, and the storyline isn't all that bad, either, considering how many of it's type have come out before.I judge games by how long i play them when i put them in, and considering i didn't put it down until i had to, this game is worth the playing to the end."
2,Anne Bonny: A Non-historical Portrayal,Very fast read with pretty much no historical accuracy whatsoever associated with the female pirate Anne Bonny. It is almost absurd to even say that this novel is loosely based after the pirate's life. I found it rather boring and more of appeal perhaps to a child
5,I heart Donovan Frankenreiter,"This cd is amazing...I had never even heard of the guy, I just wanted to try something new so I ordered it. Definitely chill and worth the money"
5,Great CD!,"This CD has been playing in my car ever since I received it. It is perfect for driving my son (19 months) to daycare and to and from work because it is relaxing and uplifting music. Track 10 is our favorite! Donavon has my son singing the lyrics ""I got you"" and ""I'll be there."""
4,Deja Entendu?,I'm not entirely convinced that Frankenreiter is not somehow the lovechild of John Mayer and Jack Johnson. Fans of either one of those artists will certainly enjoy this CD and may just have a hard time remembering who they're listening to.
4,Nice contribution to the Jack Johnson/G Love tribe,"Nice CD, quite mellow and laid back. Sometimes influenced by Jack Johnson (a buddy of Donavon), but leaning more towards soul and ballads. The guy has a pleasing voice, and could use his guitar skills more (check his tasty solo on the latest g love CD ""lemonade""). Songs are pretty good, although no one really stands out as a killer tune. Recommended."
3,Donavon Frankenreiter ~Donavon Franenreiter,"This artist is new to me, and I enjoy his mellow sound, which is perfect for relaxing or cruising on long rides in the car. My only complaint is that much of the material sounds the same. I look forward to hearing more from him in the future!"
4,surprise,I bought this cd 'out of the blue' basically did not know anything about Donavon Frankenreiter. Well..this is good music. I will be looking put for more from him.
4,good but not as good as his previous releases,"don't get me wrong, this guy is a rad surfer and makes some good music, but i prefer his previous releases. Most of the songs on this cd can be found on his other non-major label albums and I like their less produced sound on these albums. the songs changed a little for this album. i still like it though, but if you can find his other albums check them out. they have a real acoustic mellow feeling."
4,Great Album,If you like Jack Johnson you won't be diappointed with this CD. Go ahead and buy it and tell your fellow Jack Johnson music lovers about it.
5,A Summer Beauty,"It Don't Matter is the anthem of my summer. This opening track is one of the sweetest, funkiest, grooviest tracks I've heard in a long, long time. The album is worth the price alone for this insanely good opener, but the whole record is pretty solid too. There aren't any bad songs out of all thirteen of them, and there are several other outstanding songs, most notably What'cha Know About, Call Me Papa and Swing On Down. Fans of G. Love, Jack Johnson (both of whom helped with the production of this disc) and Jon Swift should definitely check out Donavon's stellar debut. I hate to say phrases like -feel good album of the year-, but this one might be just that."
5,Smooooooooth!,"This is very much a ""feel good"" CD. If you enjoy music like Jack Johnson, and G. Love; your gonna love Donavon Frankenreiter. As a professional artist of tropical and surfing art; I am always looking for good music to keep me inspired. This is one of those albums that got ahold of me with the first song and inspired me all the way through. Donovan projects the ""GROOVE"" that sets a mood so many of us are inspired by. It's the warm summer sun and cool clear turquoise water on a 4 and 3/4 inch plastic disc. Highly recommended!"
4,Well...,"It's not that I didn't appreciate this album, I just appreciated the first three Jack Johnson put out more. Don't get me wrong, the guy is obviously very talented, I mean I couldn't come close to creating anything as entertaining, but I also couldn't help feeling like I was listening to a less profound Jack. With that said, if you enjoy great background music, you'll love this album!"
3,SECRET TIP: This IS Jack Johnson!!!,"Know how some authors publish works under psuedonyms? Here's the musical version of that. This record is actually a Jack Johnson recording... the Donavon Frankenreiter name (along with the very convincing pro surfer story) was created to make this fictional artist more real!!!OK, maybe that's not true, but it might as well be...Donavon isn't just influenced by Jack Johnson... HE SOUNDS JUST LIKE HIM. If that's cool with you, buy this record. Nice, laid-back vibe that makes for good Sunday morning background music."
3,just your regular chill merchant,"now dont get me wrong - youll put this cd in, press play and be hooked. this collection of insanely chilled and catchy tunes is excellent, but you get that feelin of 'been there done that' that wears thin after a while. this ben harper-lite music that jack johnson has been bangin out for a few years, definitely seems to be catchin on. thats no way a bad thing but couldnt someone try something different?...."
3,not listenable - go see him live,"i bought this cd after seeing him play a live show with jack johnson on maui, i saw jack and ben harper in indianapolis and the maui show blew it away. Donavon was insanely groovy and i fell in love with his music after 2 songs. But, this cd really doesn't capture his talent whatsoever. The lyrics are kinda lame compared to Jack's, but he's not trying to be Jack, he wants simple chill music and therefore his lyrics are simple. But this CD is pretty depressing. Go see him live you'll become a fan instantly."
1,"Contrived, deliberate, and just tries too hard.........","You dont really need to listen to this album to know what to expect. You have a retro-seventies album cover and a wanna-be throwback. I admire Donavon as a surfer, but just because you surf doesnt mean you can be just as creative musically.Most of these tracks have one single common denominator, they are contrived, deliberate and boring. Musically, they have been done before and you can name a band from the 60's or 70's that influenced that song. Why not do a Scott Walker song cover? That may break up the boredom on this album. It may be mellow- but it has no soul. The music sounds forced and the lyrics dont flow well. I think being star struck is what has given him great reviews. Keep surfing Donavon and tell your sponsors it just a side gig. Look for this one in your favorite used CD section."
4,Even baby loves it!,"This is a great CD, very mellow and relaxing. It would be really great in the summer time when the weather is warm and sunny. It definitly inspires a margarita and a tan.I bought this CD shortly after my daughter was born and it's one of the few things that calm her and put her to sleep (she's got great taste in music at only 2 months old!).Unfortunatly, this album was much better before I was listening to it 4-5 times a day."
5,Great Cd,"This cd is awesome. It is the perfect cd to sit around and relax to. He is a very talented musician, and his rythm, lyrics, and melodies are amazing. His style and sound is similar to Jack Johnson, as people have said... but I do not think that Jack Johnson is any better. They have slightly different styles, and people are blinded by his talent, because he isn't as famous as Jack. They both are extraordinary musician, and I recommend both cd's."
5,Perfection,Really outdoing himself on this album. The previous releases were an asset to any collection but this album takes the cake. Jack Johnson produced it and of course he put his heart into it too since they were childhood friends. Mellow melodies and very relaxed vibes run all over this cd. A great cd to relax to after a surf session.
3,All the rage at Bonnaroo,"Heard all the hype prior to attending Bonnaroo, JJ clone and all that, bought it anyway. Enjoyable laid back album with a retro feel to it. Great hooks. Awesome for sitting by the pool..."
2,Repetitive,"I heard ""Free"" and really liked it, so I bought the CD. Unfortunately, the songs all sound pretty much the same to me. So it's good on shuffle, but not played straight through. I'm really into good lyrics too, and this one doesn't cut it in that department. He seems like a laid back, cool guy though, so I don't mind him getting my money."
4,Like the Beach Much,"If you like chilling out on the beach, by the pool, or anywhere in the sun this is the album for you. This guy is a professional surfer turned musician and his days as a beachbum obviously influenced his sound. He is a direct musical decendent of Jack Johnson and G. Love. Some may criticize him for his strong similarities with Jack's style but lyrically the two contrast greatly. He is not quite the songwriter or muscician that Jack is but I do like his voice more."
4,"You can play this album 1000 times in a row, but you can't run it into the ground.","I've seen Donavon several times now, and each time it's better. I bought this album after the first time I saw him and I've played it nearly every day since. Someone mentioned that ""This album was the anthem to their summer"". This album is an anthem to a whole stage in my life. I held back one star because the versatility exhibited in his live performance didn't quite make it on to the album. I think when his second album comes out it will probably get all 5 of my stars. We met Donavon at Telluride this year and the guy is a class act.I, like most of us, was turned on to Jack Johnson first, but when Donny's on stage he really separates himself from Jack. He has a lot of energy to give most of the time (when he's not impaired), and can really jam out with the best of them."
5,Buy this CD NOW!,"It is hard to be anything but upbeat and happy when listening to this CD. The mesh of smooth guitar, harmonica, great vocals, and even better lyrics make this album really easy to listen to. If you like Jack Johnson's music...and I love Jack Johnson's music...you'll love this CD. It's a must have for anybody who is laid back and just wants to enjoy life with a soundtrack."
4,this album was sooo soulsurfer!,perfect for day surf and mind surfing when you stuck on the city crowd or just hang in your room...i'm just listening everyday without getting bored at all..even when i hear jack johnson's inside the songs..i thinked it's still sooo donavon in lyrics and soul...original one!
3,Jack Johnson? No...but still good,"This album is gonna be love it, or hate it. While Donavon F. does have a more melodic voice then his contemporaries, he lacks the diversity from song to song that his peers, Jack Johnson & John Swift possess. Some songs stand out, others blend together. G. Love and Jack J. make appearances on one song each. If you're looking for a new face and sound that will break the mold like only surfer/musicians can, this ain't it babe. But, if you're looking for relaxing, ""chill"" music to drive or relax to, pick it up. I'm not sorry I bought it."
3,The Art of The Airways,"The commercial art work used for calendars and advertisements varies from the fairly ordinary to gorgeous vistas. Much of the artwork is nostalgic, recreating the atmosphere of the 30s and 40s. Some good memories..."
1,Uh . . . why.,"Ok, I've never been a big fan of ""greatest hits"" albums. They're usually little more than record labels cashing in on fans by reselling them music that they already have . . plus one, perhaps two new tracks. They also usually sell to the one or two casual fans that are just waiting for that one disc to get all their favourite tracks in one place.This disc does neither. It has to be the most useless, irrelevant, and pointless compilation ever released. More irrelevant even than those wretched ""20th Century Masters"" discs. This isn't even a ""hits"" album. Midnight Ride, Shooz, and Little Suzie are hardly the sort of tracks that landed Styx in the rock history books. Why does this compilation exist?!?"
2,"Honestly, Do we need this?","Not a bad song on this record. Nice to see some recognition of Shooz. This is a great song. Midnight Ride rocks as well. But, really, do we need Renegade, Blue Collar Man, and Miss America on another collection? What about Half Penny Two Penny, or even Eddie? Born For Adventure is a great rocking song.... oh wait, Dennis sang and wrote that. Ya get my point? I posted once before a theory that the current Styx keeps putting out new collections of songs that cut Dennis out of the royalties. This collection helps prove my point. I know that DDY co-wrote some of these songs, but this is getting a bit petty. Eventually, there will be enough collections out that allow a fan to purchase all of Tommy's and JY's stuff without buying any of Dennis's. They might as well put out a 3 CD set called ""All Stuff We Wrote, and None of the Stuff He Wrote."" By the way, I still love Styx, and I love Cyclorama. I just don't love the politics. Out!"
1,too bad,"This is just another attempt by the Shaw-Young Band to erase a part of their history that can NOT be denied. While I like the music of the current band, I think it's criminal to credit this music to the current lineup. Completly and intentionally omitting a founding member his due credit by plastering a photo and credits of the new band only shows the level of immaturity that still remains here. My suggestion is that you stop making your bitterness so obvious and take the high road like the abandoned member. If you can't count him as part of your history then stop trying to push the altered version on us. Hopefully most of the fans are to smart to buy into it."
1,How Ridiculous Can You Get?,"This silly bit of nonsense is, to use an expression I read, a childish temper tantrum thrown by Tommy Shaw and James Young in a ridiculous attempt to erase Dennis DeYoung from their history.They have left off many of their best rocking numbers for one reason only -- they were written and sung by Dennis DeYoung.So included are such non-essential Styx songs as Shooz and Little Suzie. And since WHEN is Crystal Ball a ""rocker""????And not included are classic Styx rockers like Rockin' the Paradise, Born for Adventure, Borrowed Time and Lorelei.If you want Styx Rockers, buy the two Greatest Hits CD's and/or their classic works such as Equinox, Grand Illusion, Paradise Theater....you get my point.Hope this thing dies a quick death and Shaw/Young make nothing off of their attempt to deny their past history of greatness when Dennis DeYoung was the creative force behind this band."
4,Not bad song-wise but...,"I have all these songs on their original CDs and I have the compilations that include songs not included elsewhere, so getting this CD would only serve to take up space in my collection that would better be served some other way. At least the Regeneration discs are new recordings and includes a new track, not to mention updates of two of Tommy's Damn Yankees tunes (and I don't feel at all as though Tommy ""pushed the band members into re-recording them"" at all...they're good tunes and it's good to hear how Styx put their stamp on them). All in all, a good collection but I have all the tracks already. I'm a completist but I don't really need this one. If you like these tunes, then by all means, pick it up...but I'm all set, thanks. No ripoff at all in my opinion...just a collection of their rockier side, and that's fine too."
1,Now More Frustrated!,"I bought this book thinking it would help me with my frustrations with the Catholic Church. Now, I am still frustrated with the Church and with this book. It is very hard to grasp. I mean that this book is confusing, the words are not meant for an average person, they are meant for a priest or highly intellectual person who already understands everything about the church. In summary, this book is a bad buy if you are looking for something that will help you understand Catholiscm, not confuse you more."
1,Being frustrated is no sin that needs to be forgiven.,"Becoming frustrated is the starting point to seekingsolutions. Unfortunately, this book didn't offer many. When your own church turns into a scandal ridden organization, the last thing we need is more dogma piled on top of it. I'm still angry at my church and will work to reform it and i refuse to be ashamed of my frustration."
1,Pretty horrible and shmaltzy,"this book is like a teenage girl type romance novel with little gossipy tidbits. overall, pretty terrible and trite just like the two sisters. it's all fluff with some interesting factoids but not enough to actually purchase the book. just read someone else's copy if someone else actually bought it which is debatable.they're kind of funny since they're so dumb and tarty. oh well."
3,Better than traditional physical therapy,"I work on a computer and was having career-threatening pain in my hands. I found this book to be more helpful than traditional physical therapy (strengthening and stretching exercises). I had a co-worker who was even worse off than I was and also found Anderson's fold and hold technique to be better than anything his therapists had him try. However, we both still had to be careful about how much we typed. We also worried about whether the pain would get worse again.Years later, I tried John Sarno's techniques for back pain. His books are entitled ""Healing Back Pain"" and ""The Mindbody Prescription"". I found that these back pain techniques also worked wonders for my hand pain. I can now type all I want on ""bad"" keyboards with only minimal pain and with no worry that it will get worse again.I would highly recommend considering Sarno's approach over Anderson's. If you do not accept Sarno's approach, then Anderson's is the next best thing."
5,Excellent book!,"I've had this for a few years, given away a copy but keep coming back to it. Nagging injury/pain has been relieved many times by using the methods in this book, I highly recommend it. Not familiar with the other books/methods mentioned, but this one works quite well for me."
2,Hard to understand some of the techniques,I didn't like it. Some techniques are hard to get or not explained very well. Better info can be found free on the net.
1,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this DVD I thought I was ordering an old comedy standup of Sinbad the comedian and his friends. Instead, I got an old cartoon. It was not what I expected but I'll keep it for small children that visit."
1,I thought it was just me,"But when I received this, it was some old cartoon that I don't even think kids would want to watch."
1,The ultimate sin - it's boring,"Purporting to be a hot romance, bordering on erotica, this novel (I am being generous in using this term) lacks understandable motivation, characterization, atmosphere, believability, and historical accuracy. And it's badly written, as well. The heroine (?) is accused of poisoning a man. By pouring the contents of a ""vile"" in his wine glass. Once is a typo. Repeated use of the wrong words (this is but one example) is simply lack of editorial control. Not surprising that it appears to be self-published - no self-respecting publisher would have accepted this drivel for publication. The one star rating is just to avoid it being unrated. I strongly recommend that lovers of historical romance, historical erotica, and good writing avoid this book."
2,Twisted,"If you'd like to read a book about a woman who repeatedly gets raped, beaten, abused and has wild sex after that, go for it.I have to admit one thing, I didn't put the book down until I've read it. I had to know what she'll go through next. But I did skip big chunks of it and didn't miss a thing.The hero didn't feel very convincing, and neither did the end. This was a long story about human evil topped off with a fairy tale ending.I just couldn't bring myself to believe that a woman so brutalized could walk away and jump into bed with the Duke next.For God sakes, she was even gang raped!!This whole book is really twisted, and I really don't recommend it."
1,Desiree has no idea what Romance is.,"I wrote a review before but I guess sensorship got in the way. This author should be pitied for her lack of Romance. I find this happening more and more these days. Maybe it is a generation thing but this book was beyond hideous. There is no hero no heroine, no story. Put simply, is the written form of hard porn. The scenes she calls erotica are anything but. Sorry Desiree but maybe you should seek other avenues, obviously writing is not your thing or at least not the Romance line."
5,SACRO SONG,"My 12 year old daughter says, "" It kicks!"" Alot of people are surprised when they learn this rapper is a traditional Catholic priest! His songs set your heart on fire for the Lord. Fr. Stan's faith is contagious. Your faith can only grow when you listen to his inspiring songs. He is the BEST!"
5,Absolutely Soul Stirring Brilliant!,"Having seen Fr Stan at the Auckland and Wellington Conventions, his varied music hits the spiritual spot for all ages, especially the youth! Decent Music and decent Lyrics!"
4,Who says priest can't be rappers?,I don't listen to rap hardly at all but love good music of all kinds. Sacro Song is a must for any serious Christian's music collection. You will never find another CD like this one. Fr. Stan is a priest in love with the Lord who has a special talent with his music. You've got to here it to believe it!
5,Such music should be used to Praise The Lord!!,His music is one of a kind...most rap music these days can't go a word without swearing.His music combines great rythm and beat with a message you can really learn and understand!!!
5,Sacro Song,This is an excellent CD that Fr. Stan has put out. It talks about alot of true things going on in the world.
5,God's Word in the New Millennium,I have been happy to recommend the series of translations of the Scripture by the Priests for Equality. Both THE INCLUSIVE NEW TESTAMENT and THE INCLUSIVE HEBREW SCRIPTURE are written with an ear to poetry. The power of God's Word rings forth with clarity with its message of love and compassion for all people and creation. I am most grateful to the Priests for Equality for a superb translation.
5,Excellent,I learned bout this book through general reading and studying. I found it to be easy reading and non-masculating.
2,Re-recordings!,"Don't let the budget price fool you, the two discs included in this set are not the original recordings, but rather re-recordings by ""one or more members of the original group."" There's nothing necessarily wrong with re-recordings per se, but if you are looking for the original recordings, skip this set. Amazon.com carries plenty of other CDs with the original recordings by these two bands.Of the two discs, The Searchers' disc sounds truer to the original recordings (love that twangy 12-string guitar sound). The same cannot be said for Herman's Hermits. The distinctive vocals of Peter Noone are missing here making the Hermits sound like just another ""cover"" band. Yes, the song selections for both groups are great, but they're just not the originals. Caveat Emptor!"
5,The Chase is on!!!,"Well if you liked the first and believed it to hold more room for the 2nd one in the series you are correct. Even though the plot lines were still a little cheesy. I thought it was much better and now there is more tension between Asuka Jr. and Saint Tail(A.K.A Meime) It was really sweet and it's a little funnier than the previous. If you thought the first one was so-so or pretty good than this one is a must!!! It's just starting to get good and leaves off kind of on a cliffhanger, and like I said earlier the Asuka Jr. is pretty close to catching her. I won't get into too many details but it's a must have!!!!!"
2,religion class,"I got this book for a class on the ""American religious experience,"" I would not have chose to read this for pleasure."
4,Very Interesting,This book is very interesting. Anyone who's interested in gardening would find this a informative read. The layout ideas are intriguing.
1,Junk,"I bought these clippers to replace the economical pair which I was using for my dog's hair cuts. I thought this set would be good since it was more expensive than most other sets. To my dismay, these clippers did not cut well, did not have any power, and constantly needed oiled. I ended up putting them aside and finishing the cut with my old clippers. I goes to remind me that I should read reviews before I buy."
1,Not what they promised...,"Yesterday, when I went into the pet store grooming area, I told the groomer that my dog had very thick, very fine hair and that in the past, I had spent more time cleaning the clippers than actually clipping. She recommended this Andis as top of the line and assured me that these clippers would solve all my problems.To be fair, my dog had some pretty gnarly mats to get through - but these clippers couldn't even finish the job. The motor kept on slowing down and slowing down. I regularly stopped to rinse out the blade and re-oiled multiple times. Right now, he is funny/scary looking as FOUR HOURS of clipping couldn't finish him (He's a 25 lb Lhasa - not that big).I will be returning these clippers today."
1,Don't bother!,"Like others, I bought these to replace the old clippers I bought from Walmart a few years ago. This was my second attempt at purchasing new clippers and was very disappointed. They can't cut my poodle's fine hair, she flinches every time they touch her skin and the run very hot. Don't bother."
4,Reeves Gabrels' Guitar Hits the Mark,Gabrels' playing makes the mediocre songs fascinating. Basically the songs are just a background for him to do his thing. The music has a lot of intricacies which is why I am still listening to this album regularly more than a decade after it came out.Too bad Bowie disbanded the band. Soupy Sales' sons on drums and bass are good too.
4,Give it a chance!,"...I consider it a Bowie classic. Deconstructed from his elaborate eariler efforts, this cuts too the bone with an alternative sound pre-dating Nirvana by several years. While this does not stand up to classics like Scary Monsters or Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, it is a hell of a lot better than Let's Dance or some of Bowies other recent works. Give it a shot!"
1,please,"most of the music is about drug's, it's okay if you are def. prob, being Im a david bowie, fan but this cd need's help. there's only one good song out of the whole cd."
3,Industrial Bowie?,"I am still in something of a quandary concerning this particular album. Bowie's foray into the industrial sound is at times very well done (for instance, in Tin Machine's cover of Roxy Music's ""If There Is Something""), but most of the time falls a little short. I think that, despite the presence of a very good group of side men (Hunt Sales, Reeves Gabrels), Bowie is trying just a little too hard on this disc. Something about his sophisticated vocals just doesn't ""fit"" with the grungier accompaniments. Interesting, but not an essential to your collection."
4,Back to Bowie's Roots,"Seems a lot of people dissed this when it came out - to me, itseemed like the best thing Bowie had done since ""Heroes"", areturn to the raw, dark, grinding guitar-based rock that hadformed the classic Ziggy and Diamond Dogs albums. The lyricswere totally out of nowhere - Bowie does protest/socialconsciousness? - but they _worked_. Frankly I think the coverof Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"" is worth the price of thewhole album, as is the devastating ""I Can't Read"" (a song thatshould be played back to back with Midnight Oil's ""Read AboutIt""). No, Reeves Gabriel is no Adrian Belew or Earl Slick, buthe certainly gives Mick Ronson a run for the money."
1,Should be Little Lulu & friends,"4 Little Lulu cartoons only 1 Woody cartoon. The only Woody cartoon is ""Pantry Panic"" which seems to be on several cartoon collections. The rest of the cartoons are a mix and are of poor quality. Buy this DVD only if you are a Little Lulu fan"
2,& FRIENDS!!!,This is called Woody Woodpecker & Friends...it should just be called & Friends. 20 cartoons of which only the 1st one is actually Woody Woodpecker. Even though some of the other cartoons on this collection are amusing. Overall this is an extreme letdown if what you wanted was Woody.
1,Woody El Pajaro Loco,Was terrible - voice quality just terrible. Would not recommend anyone to purchase it. Save your money. I wish I would have never bought it.
4,Fun for all ages,"We purchased this game so everyone in our family could play. Not to many games out there that people from 8-82 can play together. The rules are very simple and the game goes quickly so you don't have a chance to get bored.My only gripe is it is very hard to see the R on the dice. It is yellow and sometimes you cant tell if it is one of the yellow dots or a yellow R since the color is so blindingly yellow. I had to take a black sharpie and outline it so we could tell. I do like the fact that everything comes in a compact tin that you can throw into a bag to take with you on trips, or to someones house. It stores easy without taking up room.I have read other reviews on games like this where teachers have used the game for small children to tell their right from their left and with addition and subtraction. So I think this would be a great game for families. It takes only seconds to learn!"
4,"Great Game, Poor manufacture","This is a great game, but buy it somewhere else. There's plenty of dice companies on the internet that make the same game at half the price. The dice are also very difficult to read. The manufacturer didn't spend much time on design...Great game, but go elsewhere to get it."
1,What is this?,"This is not a very good effort from David. The music has no soul, its boring and overall play is just plain. I have played this album maybe twice in ten years... and that`s a lot. I can wait to get rid of it."
5,Best of baroque,"If you are a lover of the baroque era, then this 2-CD collection performed by Boston Baroque is as good as it gets. The recordings have a faster tempi which sounds very good on most of these concertos and they are crisp and clear. The transitions, from the end of one , to the beginning of the next concerto are particularly good...they appera continuous. This is a collection that I had been looking for a long time and finally managed to find."
5,exciting performance,"Being my first review for Amazon I will make this brief. I found this performance to be my favorite of all the Brandenburgs I have heard, though I course there are many I have never listened to. This recording was very well done with wonderful sound and exciting performances. Highly recommended."
5,"Magnificent ""Brandenburgs.""","This set of Johann Sebastian Bach's ""Brandenburg Concertos"" is magnificent! The Boston Baroque, under the direction of Martin Pearlman, play on period instruments with freshness and vigor, giving the music that wonderful, slightly ""abrasive"" quality that I believe baroque music should have. Overall, tempi are faster than more traditional renditions, but never seem rushed. (Faster tempi are probably more in line with Bach's original intentions). The orchestra and conductor make a wonderful team, their enjoyment of the music evident throughout. Sound quality is first-rate. I highly recommend this 2-CD set, especially for those who, like me, enjoy classical music played on period instruments."
3,Caution! Period Instruments!! Baroque tempos!!!,"If you have been raised on 20th century renditions of the Brandenburg's, this one will come as a shock. Be forewarned."
5,A great bon voyage gift,"This is an excellent travel book. Because it is small, it's easy to tuck in your purse, back pack or whatever. It's so thorough it makes the most of each meal on the road. It can bring a great new dimension to eating in countries with French, German, Spanish or Italian menus!It's so inexpensive, it's a great bon voyage gift for a friend or for yourself.We love ours!Julie & Peter Dawson."
1,Not what I expected,"I read the only review for this item and ordered it, expecting to see a fantastic display of sound and some of the interaction of these artists with Mr Hancock as they created music, each colaborating to have a unique blend of sounds.Actually this is only a documentary showing this interaction, and as such is very interesting.But if you are looking to see an hear the full length videos of these great colaborations you will be disappointed, that is not included in this dvd. Only small samples are there for you to see.This was a real disapointmet because the quality of video and audio are fantastic."
4,Tremendous!,"It's Herbie, nuff said. Always cutting edge. Always art at the highest level. No cliches, nothing wasted, always swinging. One of the greatest living musicians on the planet!L.Webb"
1,Completely dissatisfied!!,"I am COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED with this item because I NEVER RECEIVED IT!! I ordered & paid for it over a month ago & it was due to arrive during the window of June 2-17. It has not come, yet, nor has the seller responded to either of my two e-mails. In my opinion, A+ Media & Book Seller receives an F- rating for this!!"
3,Underwhelming so far,"I can't fault the gorgeous sound and the musicianship here, but the Caprices themselves have left me underwhelmed. I expected much more fire and excitement, more poetry. So far, they strike me as rather arid, but perhaps they'll grow on me."
4,Excellent Value for Money!!,"This 4CD package provides a great insight into Blues through the decades, ranging from the 1940's to the present day. While the first CD contains old very traditional blues music and won't be to eveyone's taste, the other 3 provide a wide spectrum of artists and variety - many of whom are not top shelf names but nevertheless great to listen to! This collection will inspire listeners to perhaps seek out these artists and purchase their CD's. I would describe this as real mix n' match collection with something for everyone. Definitely recommended - especially at this price!"
5,Nokia OEM Car Charger N90 6101 6102 3155i,Item works great with my 6103 phone. No errors on phone and plug fits like a glove.
2,"Good price, 1 of 2 bad products","The product was shipped quickly and a good price, but one of the two chargers received only works intermittently and does not properly charge the phone."
1,It doesn't work,It took me weeks to track down the shipment. Finally it got re-shipped but the item doesn't work with Nokia 6101. Such a waste.
2,not doing its purpose,its ok because for an hour drive Iput on the charger and it still has not charged!
4,From Tupelo Honey to Sammy Hagar,"I like Ronnie Montrose and I like this album. Ronnie is a American Guitar virtuoso and his musical history is a delight to follow. I love the fact that he was part of Van Morrison's band and played on Tupelo Honey and not long after that was part of the Edgar Winter Group, and he still was performing on stage with Sammy Hagar in 2004. This album is very enjoyable to listen to. You will hear some great guitar, some great songs and some riffs that you will recognize from some of the many bands that Ronnie was involved with."
4,"If you're a true A&C fan, buy it.","You might be disappointed in the gags, which are all rehashed from earlier films. Other than that, Bud & Lou are always great."
3,Not what I expected,Actually I didn't know that it was a singing cd. I thought that it was a video cd.
5,Where is my Fendi?,"I have used Fendi for the past 20 years. I love the smell! But recently(in the past 2 years), I have not been able to find the product. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. But I use the spray Eau de Toilette and I was sent the Eau de Perfume. And it was not boxed...."
3,"A good ""at a glance"" type of book but...","Could be more in-depth on the genetic diseases, ie von Willebrand's and Wobblers, and Cardio. Pretty good for novice/newcomers, but covers some basic info. Did a decent job with the history, very brief and concise but got the job done. Not a very reliable, ""true"" source, but a good second opinion. It did keep my interest, though, and had a picture of one of the great fawn dobes, Ch. Ravenswood 20 20. Don't believe everything you read though. I would have liked them to describe the four colors, and also mention the white dobes, which are harmful to the breed. Overall, could be a better book, but there was some good in it."
2,Informative for the potential owner,"I found the information presented was good and well thought out. I think this book is more applicable to the potential owner then the current owner, because of the training methods supported in the book. this may be due to when the book was written, but does not jive with most of the current literature that I have been reading."
1,Blegh,"I found this book to be way too brief. It shows no depth when it comes to the information of Dobermans, and it quickly leaves the Doberman idea behind and just states basic first aid medication that every book of this same brand has. I bought this at a pet store when purchasing toys for my own Doberman. There was obviously no real, genuine thought put into this book, and I myself, though unarticulate and not at all skilled in writing, could display more quality information instead of a brief overview of a Doberman. I personally would not have purchased this book if I had even skimmed through the pages."
1,"If you know you want a Doberman, skip this book","Rather small, it barely skims the surface of what an owner needs to know: is a dobe the right dog for you, food, bedding, accessories, temperament. You won't get much else out of it. If someone's on the fence about whether or not to get a doberman, this book MIGHT be worth buying."
1,Completely useless,"This book obviously does nothing to address issues related to Doberman pinschers. It's sole purpose is to sell copies. The information in this book could be easily researched on line in the same brief, vague overview that is in this book. Don't waste your money."
3,"American Folk Blues, Vol 1","It was good in the sense that it was historically accurate, the black and white didn't enhance it, but it was still OK. I personally like more electric blues and much of this was acoustic. I probably should have known that, live and learn, overall I'd rate it as a good ""watch and listen"""
5,GOTTA HAVE IT,"Took a while for me to order these. Wasn't sure I'd be getting authentic performances. But, from the start, I was mesmerized. Memphis Slim and Sonny Boy Williamson? Somebody smiling on me. This is a real treat. And if you don't have your copy, shame on you."
2,Disappointing,"I read some of the reviews and thought this was worth a shot. Not familiar with Narvel's music, but I thought he had some country hits that might be good. However, this album is mostly rock n roll type stuff that was not for me. Before buying this album, you had better be sure that you really like his voice and music. Make me an offer."
2,Disappointing in spite of excellent plot elements,"Having heard rave reviews of Rusch's work, I picked up _Alien Influences_ with high expectations. Unfortunately, the book should have been a hundred pages shorter. Many elements could have been tightened up, and the ""hanging suspense"" endings invariably fizzled. I found myself being so annoyed with the overuse of the words ""tangy"" and ""cinnamon"" that I began keeping track of how many times each was used, and felt strongly that they were simply being repeated as convenient shorthand. Overall, I loved the book's concepts (with the exception of a slight sell-out at the ending regarding one of the Dancer Seven), but wished that Rusch's editor had sent back the manuscript one more time."
4,Alien Influences offers disturbingly human characters,"This novel is a wonderful and absorbing read. The characters - some of whom are half-altered because of ""Alien Influence"" - never really convince the reader they are all good or all bad - in other words, they are quite human. It reads a bit like the several short stories patched together that were its original form, but is a great rainy day book none-the-less. Ms.Rusch did such a good job keeping me intriegued with the personalities of these characters, though, that I ran out and bought some of her other books."
2,Kind of pointless,"Tried one of these and ultimately found it rather pointless. Though maybe I just don't find Skype to be all that useful.After we started looking around, we found a voip service (voiSip) that could handle all of our local incoming and outbound calls, along with US, Canada, and even our occassional calls to Germany. And they could do it all using our existing phones, though we ended up buying more powerful 4-line phones because voiSip allows you to have as many lines and phones as our internet can handle at no extra charge.I even got a 6 dollar voiSip plan for my home, bought some cheap 2-line vtech cordless phones, and I use their free video conferencing software on my notebook."
3,For someone new to the game,This book was written for newer players that want to develop and extend their game. It contains a section discussing the different types of games that you might run into. The examples and simple suggestions on how different styles affect the game are great for the new player.The best part of the book is the tables that give you the correct pot odds for your bet. They are great to commit to memory until you can calculate the odds yourself. I found that expected value and calculating pot odds are important in lower limit games and having these tables helps your stack from shrinking.
3,Not quite what its title claims to be,"This is a good book if you are brand new to poker and to Texas Hold'Em...A sort of primer or overview. While there is useful information for the beginner, it's title is misleading. The ""Intelligent Guide"" hints that the content is going to be in-depth, which it isn't (it merely introduces very basic topics such as strategy, mathematical calculations, etc. in a very cursory way). Also, the cover advertises that the book ""Includes detailed instructions for online poker"", which is also a gross overstatement (only cursory information about playing online that could be obtained just as easily with a few hours of internet research).Your money would be much better spent buying Lou Krieger's ""Hold 'Em Excellence: From Beginner to Winner"" for learning the game, and ""Internet Texas Hold 'Em: Winning Strategies from an Internet Pro"" for learning the ins and outs of playing the game online."
5,Cuttin Hedz',"ODB's first joint is amazing. Lyric wise not one of the sharper swords in the WU he makes up with it, with his unmistakable energy. Of course, stellar production throughout the entire LP makes this a definite own!"
4,You fooled us all,"I remember buying this C.D in in April 1995 and upon my initial listen, thinking to myself,""What the hell did I just waste my money on?"" But flashforward 14 years and I still play it regularly, much more so than some recently purchased albums. There is something here that sticks with you. Seldom has an artist imprinted his whole personality on a record as O.D.B has here. This is an amazing record with some slammin' jams, but his whole f'd up personality takes center stage. Someone once described him as the Richard Pryor of rap. They might not have been too far off as he was definately, dare I say it, a troubled genius. For the sake of his 13 children, I wish he was still here. However, I recognize someone with demons when I see them and I believe this cat is better off at peace. Rest in peace and thanks for the 2 great solo albums and all the Wu Tang jams. You've earned your rest, Ol' Dirty Great One."
5,This is Hip-Hop,"Its almost impossible to explain what makes this album the masterpiece that it is. Many people bought this album and dismissed it as a mess after two or three listens. But, as with all classics, the finer qualities are not revealed until you have really persevered. The production is easily the RZA's best work to date with each track complimenting the one that follows. In my opinion the song 'Snakes' represents the height of the shaolin style of hip-hop that the Wu pioneered, while Tracks like 'Damage' and 'The Stomp' reveal the ODB's true genius.All I can say is that this album is an overlooked classic that must be owned AND LISTENED TO by anybody with a real love for hip-hop. There are a few albums that are landmarks in Hip-Hip such as 'The Cronic', 'A nation of millions' and 'Illmatic'. Return to the 36 chambers is one of these albums."
5,best wu mid 90s solo for real,"i really think this was the best wu solo, raes was more lyrycal with beter beats but this cut was too funny man it was madd"
3,If your into ODB,To be straight to the point if you are into ODB 99.9 percent of the buyers will love the album. When i first heard this album i could'nt stop playing brooklyn Zoo that tune was dark from start to finish pure BEEF (hardcore) i also rated shimmy shimmy ya / protect ya neck II the zoo them few tunes did it for me the rest of the album could have been beter but could have been worste. ODB is a artist that you have to know how to take him because the guys mad if you have never heard any of his Albums if you decide to buy one (recomended Return to the 36 chambers: the dirty verson) you will either love it or hate it one or the other but you will never know until you buy it. But if your not into hardcore at all then this wouldnt be your kind of cd but the best way obviously is to find out for your self YOU BE THE JUDGE...........CASE CLOSED
1,How bad is this?,"This is the worst album in my collection. No doubt about it. I can't believe my friends convinced me to buy this crap. The only thing that prevents me from throwing this in the trash is the song ""Cuttin' Headz."" Everything else sucks. the ODB is lame as a soloist; among the masses of the Wu, he's not half bad, but his lack of talent is exposed when you listen to this album. The RZA isn't at his best on this album. Avoid this. It's not worth your time or money."
4,This is when he shined,"Ol' D.B. shined like a rugged diamond on this album. The cuts are killer and the grooves are just amazing. He is the most ecclecticly distinctive of the Wu Tang Clan. This is one of the best of the Wu-solo albums. It stands up there with Raekwon's solo opus ""Only Built 4 Cuban Linx"". Recommended."
5,the wick of the wu firecracker,"the illest wu album out there not going for the mainstream but rather saying what he feels instead it's good to hear something coming from the heart rather than just for the $$$ listen to the d*** album, and there's no way you can say that it isn't bangin'!!""snakes"" definately having to be one of the greatest tracks created by the wu...the true definition of HARDCORE rap"
4,Dirty Dirt Style,"ODB's unique drunken style of rapping had many listeners not understanding his vocal skills. This album exposes ODB of who he is, with his brutal honestly about everything in life. With half rapping, halfing singing and also ocassionally muttering incoherent mubbling, you can't help but love this album. Hard to listen to, yet hard to put down and as ""RZA"" as the no. 1 beat supplier, you can't go wrong."
5,ODB FOREVER,I've been bumping this album for a decade. This insane masterpiece will live on for generations of hip hop fanatics to enjoy. And to all those in heaven... watch out. Dirty will be dirty. RIP.
4,Entertaining and Informative,"An entertaining book full of fun and informative tips for makeup and lifestyle. Loved the before and after shots and the step by step instructions for makeup application and facial contouring. After 35 years I have finally learn't how to shape my eyebrows to suit my face.....that was well worth the price of the book. The great thing about this book is that is not just about makeup, it is about selfworth and being kind to yourself. Not just about outer beauty but about letting the inner beauty shine through."
3,Has some useful information,"If you want to know more about Victoria Jackson and how she got her start, this is the book for you. She goes into her life history, and how she got started as a famous make up artist. While she may be extremely talented, this book falls short on technique on how to properly apply make up. I would suggest looking at a few other books before making a final decision on this one. She has an excellent primer on how to properly groom your eyebrows. Her suggestions for other types of application are very basic, and they are ideas you most likely have already read somewhere else."
1,Too much chatter,"I wanted to buy a GOOD book to make myself up for my wedding. Victoria Jackson loves to talk about herself... lady this is not an autobiography. And the entire USEFuLL info can put in 10 pages maximum. The information is very basic, any woman who has been using makeup and reading articles in magazines will know. No Creative looks, and even for eyes just one way of applying eyeshadow is given. Nothing about highlighting or glitter... not even the smoky eyed look.... Plus all she does is advertise her products, how everyone loves them. A book is supposed to be objective not preachy. And info on tools is very limited too.DON'T BUY THIS ONE........"
2,Hard to maintain interest,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good read about exploring the mind, emotions, and reasoning (hence the title). The first chapter starts out interesting but it goes downhill after that. I don't mind the author's ideas but I found his writing very obtuse and hard to follow at times. He could have made this book more interesting to the average reader."
2,"Book ""Yes""; Audio ""No!""","This is an obviously important book. The author has developed a solid, profound argument for the key role emotion plays in affecting reason. His examples are interesting and convincing. However, I urge the reader to forego the audio edition. It is presented in uninspiring, monotone speech that is really quite boring. If one is particularly motivated to learn this material (as I am), then the audio cassette may be a useful accompaniment to the text. For less motivated listeners, I urge you spend your money on something else, unless you need a sleep aid."
5,"""Descartes' Error"" is clear, thought provoking and enjoyable","Antonio Damasio has a clear concise style that makes the great deal of information he presents quite enjoyable to read. His point of view is beautifully expressed and explained along side competing view points and the evidence. I'm sure no one has it right yet, but this is an important step toward a real understanding of how the human mind and reasoning operates."
5,Engaging to the Last,Superb read by Dr. Damasio-- both inspirational and engaging. The walk through how the mind sorts reasoning in cooperation with emotion is compelling and fascinating.
2,Too much speculation,"If you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you. The scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail. It's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis (which is disputed by the way). Without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la William James) from the reader more than anything else."
4,"Would give it a 5 star, but...","The other reviews cover the pluses and minuses of the book quite well, so I will be brief. I will give the book a 5 star rating on the subject and the insight it bestows. Would I read it again? Yes. Was it an enjoyable read? No and Yes. As the other reviews clearly articulate, the author jumps from well written examples and explanations into obtuse, obscure language with not so much as a polite warning. Ultimately I am glad I read it, and I will recommend it to friends but with a respectful heads up."
4,A review of the reviewers,"Except for a couple of the customer reviews i found the rest of them to be written by a collection of half-wit philosopher would be's.I would truly like to know if one of these people honestly knows anything about the human brain.The truth is that no one really does.Philosophy,since the beginning has been nothing more than a trail of babbling nonsense that only people with not too much of a life find themselves engulfed in."
4,Neuroscience of Decision Making,"I recommend this book for any cognitive neuroscientist interested in emotion or decision making. Damasio goes through some neuroscience research history and some philosophical decision making research history to tell you about some classical views about decision making and consciousness. He then manages to flip that all around by citing some of his own convincing research on the subject, which proves that emotion is absolutely necessary in human decision making.I thought it was a really interesting read, and I used it for a final paper for a Cognitive Neuroscience class."
4,luther vandross?,"i heard dance with my father and i was all chilled,i mean can anyone sound so much like luther vandross?give him a chance and you luther fans too he sounds great.frightening how much his voice resembels luther's"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SANITY!,"I flopped at FlyLady (a FREE internet service!) and somehow thought this would be the answer. I had to get the book out of my house.I thought a complete overhaul was necessary, but it wasn't. No one needs a complete overhaul! Well, compulsive people, maybe, and control freaks. They need help, but not from a book!I am so angry thatI was suckered into buying it. The website is very slick. I got worked up and believed this book would change my life. I even waited for the mail to come each day.My new policy is that if the library doesn't have it, I am not going to waste money on it. They have a huge book budget and cooler heads. I do not doubt that poor Brook Noel did read all the books in the library on the subjects covered in her book. She's a little obsessive! She claims she has conquered a severe eating disorder. I say she has just switched the focus from food to something else. Quite frankly, I find it all disturbing."
3,Covers the Basics,"This book is different from some of the others out there but it still is not for everyone. I love her website idea and the fact that you can talk to others who are working through the book. Brook does offer help for those who prefer to work on their own. If you can work through part I of this book then it will be easy for you. I found Part I to be a tiny bit confusing in that she did not make it clear what to do with the information in your catch all notebook. I have things written in my notebook that still need to be dealt with. Maybe I am stubborn or maybe I am stuck or perhaps I did not read through it well enough. Very motovational for the parts I did understand but sorry Brook, I am still stuck in my rut."
2,Nothing new here,"I had a chance to look this book over, and don't understand what all the fuss is about. There is nothing new here, from cleaning to menu planning, to relationships that hasn't been said better in other books, or even free online, and this book is double-spaced type throughout, so you go through more pages than you should have to finding this out. I hate it when book publishers waste paper like this.The most annoying part of the book is the constant (every other day's entry) exhortation to go buy the companion workbook to get all the worksheets. If she had printed it in an 8 1/2 by 11"" format, AND included the worksheets as templates, itwould be worth the price new, as it is, in a smaller size, hold off and buy it used."
3,Too Much to Do for the Truly Overwhelmed,"The well-meaning author of the ""Change Your Life Challenge"" has organized a thorough and detailed method of changing virtually every area of your life in 70 days (more or less).The problem is, her system may be a bit TOO thorough and detailed for the truly overwhelmed.She tells readers often that, ""when you are overwhelmed, you want change NOW"".Um, yes. Correct. What we DON'T want is endless worksheets, lists, and forms to fill out. (Most of which should be ordered from the author's website, she tells us.)I wasn't expecting a ""quick fix"", or maybe I was. At least one quick enough to provide me with simple, do-able daily steps, perhaps even twenty-minute tasks each day.Instead, I read about a system that would have had me spending WAY too much time ""contemplating"".Changing issues like ""self-esteem"", ""relationships"", etc. are part of a ""makeover"", but yikes! ALL the exercises/tasks are too long, and frankly, boring."
5,excellent book,I have used both this new book and the older edition. I like both- have found them more helpful than anything else I have tried over the years to help with organization.I like both editions-- the second ( this one) gives more options depending upon your lifestyle and the first is more regimented which is better for me. It suggests you need to finish the program. Although I agree I have gotten tremendous benefit from doing just part of the program. The preprinted notebook and inserts are not essential but have been great. Products are high quality. I have not used the online group support but imagine for some this would also be very helpful.
4,Finally!,"Finally, a simple plan to follow day by day. This is helping me and changing me for the better. I am so greatful to have found this book, and apply it in my life. When days get busy, I stick around on a certain day, and it only enforces the habit! This is a really great book, stick w/ it one day at a time, and you too will see changes for the better!"
5,Living the Challenge,"This is the first book on ""organizing"" that has helped me to be a better person as well. Its step-by-step approach eased me into a new way of looking at my life, and helped me to focus on the things that truly matter. While the book refers to worksheets and a workbook companion, they are optional and you can adapt the program to the techniques you are already using (in my case - Palm Pilot). I have already recommended it to every woman I know!"
2,Nothing New; Too Much Paperwork,"I'm a pretty organized person and have read my share of time management and self-help books so I didn't learn anything new from this book. (I wanted to become more organized and learn new tips as I have become a mother recently and work full-time.) The book is often vague in what to do or how to action -- you need to buy the workbook to learn what Brook is talking about. I paid an extra $18 for the workbook only to find that it was full of tables to complete (phone numbers, addresses, etc...things that I already have organized in one place). Not worth it. I asked for a refund."
5,Love It!!!,I love the program and the results are awesome. Family time at dinner is the best part of the program. I can't tell you how much I enjoy our family being together for one meal. My house is clean and I know where everything is located. I got rid of stuff we didn't use anymore and made some money from it. How cool is that?
5,CYLC,"This book has changed my life already and I've only been following it for a week! I know that may sound dramatic,but along with the support from others via the message board I can already feel the benefits.A very intesting plan. Extremely well written.A must have for any busy woman."
3,Know blessing,"Here is a secret I would like to share.This goes completely against the teaching for the natural man.. but for those who have the Spirit..When you have committed your sins, don't wallow in guilt and self condemnation. Look up to heaven, see Jesus standing in heaven in your defence. See how pleased the Father is with the Son. See Christ is in you completely righteous and proclaiming His obedience to the Father- the resurrected Christ is in you. Reject your feelings of condemnation and walk in newness of life again. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ has set us free from the law of sin and death.When you believe who you are in Christ ,you will know the cleansing of the blood in the ""twinkling of an eye"" when you see Jesus as He is. This is called faith in the truth that is already in you."
2,"Zatoichi, Vol. 6: TV Series",Zatoichi's the Bomb... unfortunately one of the two discs was scratched all to hell... it was loose when I received it and must have gotten scratched in transport ?
4,Trusting God Discussion Guide compliments and reinforces that which you learn from the book,"Trusting God: Even When Life Hurts Discussion Guide is a great accompaniment to the book; it is a help and resource to addressing, understanding and healing the hurts and heartaches that we all are certain to face in life."
5,A well-written and biblically accurate source of comfort,"A well-written and biblically accurate source of comfort to those suffering. Finally, Christians have an answer to the popular book _When Bad Things Happen to Good People_ by Rabbi Kushner. I think the book is well-organized and theologically sound. Bridges clearly shows from a Bible perspective that God is sovereign, in control, and loving all at the same time.I commend this book to anyone who is suffering from a set back or tragedy. Bring your tough questions and even your anger over ""WHY?"", Bridges shows rightly that God stands with open arms ready to comfort us in our point of need."
5,A treat to read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It takes the reader back through many years and presents a clear picture of life in each era, through the eyes and personal experiences of this wonderful actor and kind-hearted soul. Whether you're reading about young Dennis picking strawberries in Oregon fields with his family -- to make it through tough financial times -- or his often amusing experiences in Hollywood, this book will entertain and uplift you. Written in a warm, conversational, highly accessible tone. Reading ""All The World's A Stage"" gives you the feeling of relaxing in a porch rocking chair with a good cup of coffee, listening to timeless stories told by an old friend. Full of anecdotes and Hollywood history, woven together with wisdom and spirituality.-- Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"
3,Not For Gunsmoke Fans,"I purchased the book in hopes of getting some information on his time spent with the Gunsmoke cast and crew in addition to other western roles he's played. It soon turned into he an his wife's personal feelings and efforts about the economy and ecology and strayed too far from his western actor background in my opinion. The writing style left something to be desired as well. There were many places where the author added pices of her direct conversations with Dennis - I said ""you really did that?"" Dennis ""Oh yes I really did."" Author ""I don't believe it. Tell me more."" - Not something I enjoyed. I imagine it's a great book if you don't go into it thinking that you're going to read a biography about a western actor."
5,A very good product.,"The pillow is very good and comfortable. Some noise is present as buckwheat should polish with time, in any case it's not a problem.Recommended."
5,awesome,"Huge neck pain before getting this pillow and apparently all my ""queen"" pillow cases are actually twin size because it fits snugly.I tried water pillows, foam, cotton, tempurpedic, etc before this product, including 3 chiropractic pillows. Nothing is as comfortable and supportive. Even my eyeballs feel relaxed! (I'm serious!) It turns a crappy mattress into great support just by a pillow! (It makes sense though when you consider animals and baby's body positioning being determined by neck support...see Alexander Technique)Now I just want more."
2,pros and cons,"The buckwheat pillow keeps your head cool, however, it is much harder than a conventional pillow (almost like a bean bag) and it is noisy when sleeping on your side (when you move, the husks make enough noise to be distracting)."
2,Great pillow for a while,"I purchased one pillow in early June. I think it was about about a month and a half later when I woke up and had buckwheat hulls all over the place. The pillow had split apart along one of the seams and leaked hulls into the pillow case. The pillow did not split at the sewn seam like I would expect, but tore right NEXT to the seam. The tear was a surprise because the pillow case seems to be pretty good quality. The plan is to take it my mother-in-law, who can sew the heck out of it. It won't be pretty, but functional.Now... defect aside... I liked the pillow. My preference was for a down pillow, but those are super expensive these days. This pillow is similar from the standpoint that you can shape it the way you want and it holds its shape - great for stomach sleepers. The support is very firm though. I took a fair amount of hulls out and put them in a Zip-Lock bag - that made the pillow work better for me. I found the smell pleasant - sort of like cedar, maybe."
3,buckwheat pillow,I like soft and this pillow is just a little too firm for me.My husband likes it - he used to move his pillow around everytime he moved (his pillows would be wore out in only a few months) and this pillow is heavy so we are hoping it will last longer than other pillows for him.
3,Cool but heavy,This pillow is heavy! It is best if you just let the pillow be and make up the bed around It.
3,Perfect pillow search.,"I bought a Bucky Duo as my first buckwheat pillow. It is a 50/50 buckwheat/millet pillow. I loved the Bucky soooo much I just wished it was bigger, so I decided to buy a full sized buckwheat pillow. This pillow is nicely made, good hulls etc; however, I realized that it was the 50/50 buckwheat/millet that made the Bucky duo so wonderful for me. So even though this is a nicely made buckwheat pillow, it did not fill my needs. I have since ordered a full-sized 50/50 pillow from another company that I am happier with. If you want just a buckwheat pillow I would order from this company. It is a nice quality and the company is very fast. I would suggest ordering the quilted zipped cover along with the pillow. Quality and supplier five stars, the product just was not right for me."
5,Sleep better with a Buckwheat pillow,"I have been using a buckwheat pillow for the past 8 years. This is the only pillow to use if you have any kind of neck problems. I have never had a better pillow and NO neck issues since. Try it, you'll be glad you did"
5,Best Pillow Ever,"We've been through countless regular pillows, down, feather, foam, and none last longer than a few months before becoming out-of-shape and non supporting. I'd read a lot of reviews about these pillows and finally decided to try one.Don't expect a soft, fluffy pillow. These are hard, but they comform to your head and you can shape them so they support your head and neck comfortably.There is some noise and a smell (not unpleasant)from the hulls, but you get used to it.I only purchased one, then purchased another a bit later for my husband. These are great pillows, don't hesitate to get one!"
4,good support but loud,"The feel of buckwheat pillows takes some getting used to, but they do provide excellent support, especially if you are a side or back sleeper. They also last longer than a conventional pillow, owing to the durable nature of the hulls. The quality of this particular pillow was excellent and the pillowcase is zippered for easy cleaning and adjustment of the fill amount.That said, I prefer my feather/down pillow. The support is almost as good and unlike a buckwheat pillow, it is silent; the noise is especially noticeable if you're a side sleeper. I might reuse this filling in something like a travel pillow, but for bed sleeping, I'm sticking with down."
5,Great pillows,"My husband and I were watching TV one night and an info-mercial came on about the Japanese Sobakawa pillows. My hubby's been to Japan numerous times and said he loved the pillows there and would like to buy some. Being the good wife that I am, I decided to buy the pillows for him (and myself, of course) for xmas. When I looked up sobakawa on the interent, organic buckwheat pillows popped up, so I decided to investigate buckwheat pillows as an alternative. The reviews were fantastic! So, I took a gamble and ordered the buckwheat pillows. We've been sleeping on them since xmas night, they're great! The buckwheat hulls can be moved around inside the case to wherever you need them and they provide just the right support. So, no matter what your sleeping position, side, back, tummy, you'll be comfortable. It's not a soft, fluffy kind of pillow, and might take some getting used to but we adapted to them right away."
4,quick and nice,It ws shipped to me a few days after I placed order.It was nicely packed and with instruction.The pillow cover is good quality cotton.
4,Nice Pillow...,This is really a nice buckwheat pillow...But it's to high for me..It's not any fault of their's though.. I have 2 bad disc's in my neck and the hight has to be just right...I have to just keep taking out the buckwheat until it's right for me......
4,Good Enough,"This pillow won't work miracles. You won't rest your head on it and feel like your in heaven. However, it is a LOT better than an average pillow. I absolutely love mine. It provides your neck with good support but takes frequent adjusting."
4,Great pillow!,I had been having lots of pain in my neck and upper back and I realized my old buckwheat pillow was no longer supportive enough. I love this new pillow and slowly my neck is feeling much better. Just enough filling.
1,buckwheat pillow,"I have a severe sensitivity to odors. They trigger my asthma. In all the write ups about buckwheat pillows, I never saw reference to the fact that buckwheat hulls have quite a strong smell to them. Therefore, I was never able to use the pillow. When I inquired about returning it, there was such a large fee involved that it really was not worthwhile packing it up and shipping it back. The advice I got was to empty out the hulls and let them air out. I had already done this....it has been several months since I started airing them out and the smell is still too strong for me to tolerate. I'll give it some more time, but had I known about the odor, I certainly would never have ordered the pillow."
1,Infested with bugs! Do NOT buy.,"I bought a buckwheat pillow figuring I would try it out. However, I soon after found other pillows I liked, so I not only never used the buckwheat pillow but I never even opened it. Thank god for that because when I took it out of the closet today, the pillow was infested with tons of tiny bugs, all crawling around pillow and the inside of the, hopefully still sealed, plastic bag. I'm hoping none of these disgusting bugs escaped and needless to say the pillow is already in the garbage. I saw another review here about bug infestations with these pillows. This is completely irresponsible of this company to sell bug infested pillows and they should be put out of business."
2,Miserable to sleep on,I am surprised at the good reviews! The best way to explain what it's like is to think of sleeping on a pillow filled with sand. You can shape it how you want and it's not soft. I tried this for many nights and couldn't get myself to like it.
2,Bugs,"Didn't want to believe it going off of one review I saw here, but some of these pillows do in fact have bugs. Mine did. The pillow comes in plastic casing. The bugs were crawling inside of the casing on the pillow itself, which makes me think it's an issue with the manufacturer rather than Amazon's warehouse, where the order came from last.In other news, the item came in a large box that was dented on the side and sealed up haphazardly with tape. I've never had this happen before with Amazon. It's bizarre."
5,Excellent replacement pillow,"I have slept on a buckwheat pillow for years...I got one of the subakowa (sp) infomercial kind at least 7 years ago. buckwheat pillows do make your head and neck more comfortable and you avoid the ""hot pillow"" problem that you get with regular pillows. My old one did not have a zipper and was smaller than twin size.The new one is a great replacement. It is a bit heavy. I find I only move pillows around alot when my head or neck is uncomfortable and so the weight is not an issue for me and I like the fact that it fits a standard pillow case.I find it really allows my neck muscles to relax and has a zipper so you can take out or add buckwheat husks (when it gets older)to get that perfect comfort fit."
1,Uncomfortable pillow,"I had high expectations for this pillow after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, I just couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep on this thing. It gave me neck and ear pains most mornings when I woke up. I really dislike that the buckwheat hulls form a very hard surface to sleep on and they do not give. It felt like I was sleeping on a giant bag of rice. To have a contoured spot for my head to rest on (instead of just a flat surface) I basically had to carve a spot out of the pillow with my hands, lay my head in it and then lift the sides of the pillow up to form the hulls around my head. I tried to make it work for about five months, but it just wasn't the one for me."
3,It's OK,I have had this pillow for about a month now and it's ok. I does shape to your head and is very adjustable but it isn't very soft. The beads are bigger than i was expecting. It does not smell if you put two pillow cases on. I am extremely sensitive to smells and I can't notice anything. I put the second pillow case just to make sure I couldn't smell anything.I have noticed that the pillow is becoming a little softer as time goes on. I think the beads inside are getting a little more rounded with the movement so that's a good thing.
4,Supportive,"The pillow supports the head and neck as advertised. I find it great for sleeping on my side, not as good for sleeping on my back. A couple facts to keep in mind that may or may not matter to you: it is EXTREMELY heavy so not a travel option; it is somewhat noisy and repositioning can wake a light sleeping bedmate."
2,Too noisy,Too noisy no one wanted to sleep on it so I didn't even take it out of the plastic. I didn't want it to get dirty if I was returning it. Afterwards I thought it might have been quieter if I had taken it out.
2,Like a brick,Ordered this pillow because of all the great reviews. I was shocked when I got it. None of the other reviews mentioned that it is very hard. The pillow feels like its filled with hard beads.
1,non sleeping Organic Buckwheat Pillow -,"Impossible to sleep on....unless you care to rest your head on pebbles, which might be fun if at the beach.Contents of the pillow are also useable to decorate ""flower beds"".""I'd turn back if I were you""."
2,Great comfort and support,I like buckwheat pillows for their capacity to mold themselves to the shape you need to get the comfort you want. After a few months of use they are still great.
1,Organic Buckwheat Pillow - Twin/ Standard Size,Keeps your head cool and fits a standard US pillow case; delivery was expeditious and the product is well made. What else needs to be said?
3,Children's Literature,This product arrived in a very timely fashion. The binding was a little ripped but the pages were in excellent condition. The service was very good. I do not rememmber reading in the discription about the binding but at the cost it was a good deal.This edition of Anthology of Children's Literature contains many of the classic children's tales and stories. It is the basis for a language culture understanding for English teachers. I would recommend it for anyone who is teaching ESL classes as well as for just plain fun reading.
3,Average Plus,"Back in 1996, in the era before the download, I ran out and bought this CD after hearing the song ""Bad Reputation"" play at the end of one of my all time favorite movies, Kicking and Screaming. I rewound the credits several times so I could hear it over and over again before doing so. I still love it to this day. The tune remains one of the most poignant and beautiful four minutes one can experience. However, the rest of the album is uneven and mediocre. I think ""Two Lovers Stop,"" ""Evie's Garden,"" and ""Evie's Tears"" are good but most of the rest of CD is merely serviceable. If you don't know anything about Johnston but love ""Bad Reputation"" then I recommend just downloading it as a single song."
4,On top form...,"A delicate little album from one of America's most criminally neglected singer-songwriters, This Perfect World is a step down from the dizzy heights of Can You Fly?, but is a different, more rounded album too. The title track is a masterpiece, Bad Reputation is very special and Cold Again and Two Lovers Stop are classic Freedy Johnston. A must for fans, a very good starting point for those uninitiated. Especially recommended to fans of Matthew Sweet, 10,000 Maniacs, Michelle Shocked et al."
3,Lukewarm Romance For Blizzard,"If you're looking for steamy love scenes, this is not a quick story for you.Zoe Montgomery and her infant daughter Daphne are on a very dangerous road in the east coast when they're passed up by a large truck. Cooper Bryant is the driver who finds himself feeling responsible to help Zoe because he believes, at first, that she doesn't know what she's doing in a storm that is quickly turning into a blizzard.Zoe and Cooper leave their vehicles and stay in a hunting cabin they find. There they will share several days and heal wounds they both have and learn what is really important to the individual as well as to the other.I will say the confrontation of deamons by both Zoe and Cooper is well written, but I find it hard to believe much else in the story, even what transpires between Zoe and Cooper. This book is the end of the 'Baby on Board' series."
3,What the previous review failed to mention...,"...is that you also have to be about 250+ lbs. for it to fit correctly. The straps for the belt are waaaay too long. Also I have to agree that there are also waaaay too many velcro straps that it's hard to figure out what is for what. It's still ok, even if it's a little confusing."
2,I think that this is one of the worst soundtrack albums I have,"ever heard. For one thing, if I want to hear the dialogue from the movie I'll watch the damned movie and I thought I'd never say this but this is one score by Jerry Goldsmith that I just cannot stand. And he's my favorite composer! I just find his music obnoxious which I'm sure worked for the film. I always admired hisventures into jazz----""The Russia House"" is his supreme work in that arena---but his music here just rubs me the wrong way and I never thought I'd ever say that about his music. Just didn't enjoy this one at all."
4,Interesting Music and Dialouge,The music on this album was Jazzy and held a nice mood. The dialouge was interesting enough to catch my ear so I could want to watch the film.
2,Save your Money and get the Ben Bagley Recordings,"Sounds like it was done in somebody's basement with only a computer for an ""orchestra"". One song sounds exactly the same as the next. Obviously, as a ""rarities"", there are few well known songs here, even to a an R&H; geek like myself, but once heard, all are quickly forgotten. Stick to the 5 (and counting?) Ben Bagley recordings of Rodgers and Hart, where they put their heart into the recordings and provide (unlike this set, zero documentation), historical background about the songs and a bit about whey they never saw the light of day.I did not do one star, only to keep encouraging people to mine the Great American Songbook for more lost treasures. However, as any prospector would tell you, some times things don't ""pan out""."
1,Review the Reviewers,"I have been waiting for WKRP In Cincinnatti for so long.....then those who have seen it report it as cheapened and incomplete regarding the music of the era. I was going to buy it, but now I will not. I want the real thing or nothing. Thanks people for the ""Head's Up."""
5,helpful social studies resource,This book is a helpful resource for social studies teachers who like to entertain and enhance student learning beyond the textbook.
1,I HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!,"Unlike most readers, I hated this book! I mean, come on, you knew these two were gonna get paired up! Even when they wern't a couple, they sure acted like one! I loved the book A Kiss Between Friends, and most of my friends thinks the two books were a lot alike, but I hated this one! A Kiss Between Friends had more meaning. I cried when I read that book, it was so good! I cried when I read this book, too, because I was so happy I was finally finished with it!"
1,Canned Music,"After seeing the live show, this poorly-produced release left much to be desired. The canned drum effects and the lackluster sound mixing left this album sounding lifeless and generic. After hearing the first EP, and now this, I was left disappointed. Don't bother!"
5,Highly Slept-On,"THis album is truely underrated, and a classic in every sense of the word. Pete Rock produced some gems here, and the sound is a lot more polished than ""Mecca and the Soul Brother."" It's a shame that these guys only dropped 2 LPs. Guess it is better to go out on top. Do yourself a favor, get a late pass, and pick this up!"
5,Quality Listening,"I still listen to this CD as if it dropped yesterday. Being a mad hip-hop fan since 1980, I think I have acquired an ear for quality rap. There are very few rap acts that have real chemistry & these two have mastered the artform. This CD makes you proud of Hip-Hop.An excellent combination of a Gifted Producer& Profound Lyricist."
5,#1 SoulBrotha no question!,"Classic Album, I used to play the sh@# out of this tape when going into the city in N.Y. Pete Rock & C.L together can tell a great story of innercity life! Beats are sweet and the lyrics are tight. Unquestionably a classic!"
2,Shockingly sub-par lyricism,"I loved this album as a pre-teen in the early noughties, but it doesn't hold up. He calls himself CL the 'sextified', over and over - and that sums up the tone of this album. I don't know what happened but C.L. smooth fell off so hard on this album. He's just sex-obsessed on this, it makes most of the tracks awkward and unlistenable and off-putting. He's trying to play an LL Cool J ladies-man role, and it is just not working at all. And that's a damn shame because this is some of Pete Rock's best production (that is, when he doesn't simply xerox the samples from Donald Byrd) perhaps some of the best production of the era period. If only there were someone else on the mic riding these beats, this record would be mentioned alongside Illmatic and Ready to Die as the genre's most beloved classics."
4,Spirit Lifting and Soul Moving,"I picked up this CD by accident. To much of my surprise, I was so moved from the very first song, until the last note of the CD. It not only makes me wanting to listen to it over and over again, it makes me to sing along with some of the songs. Irish blessings is a great song, and the chorus makes it even a better song. I highly recommend this CD."
1,where is the old kristi rose,the original kristi rose and the midnight walkers is a great album - this one is nothing like it. not worth the money. has none of the excitement and high energy of the original.
4,Great Motivational Read!,"Teri Clemens' book is a great ""pocket motivator"" -- for those who are involved in sports AND those who may not be. As a coach and a teacher, I plan to use this as a great reference book for my athletes and students alike, as a way to inspire them both on the court and in life."
3,Elvis to Mott,"This was a very promising lineup but unfortunately with a lineup change lost their steam and interest from the A&R folks. This could have been a better record but producer by credit, Mitch Easter did nothing to help make that happen. This band wrote great songs and were very good live. This isn't a bad record. I own the cd and though back then didn't feel this way, it is very hard to listen to now. It sounds very dated."
1,Biblical DVD on Creation & The Flood,"I had planned to use this DVD in a Sunday School lesson on ""creation"" for children from kindgergarten to 5th grade. Unfortunately, the DVD only incorporates ""creation"" in varying segments throughout the DVD, which creates a logistical problem for a classroom setting where we have only a limited time period and can't spend a lot of time fast-forwarding the DVD. The initial segment on ""creation"" shows Eve's bare breasts, which is inappropriate for children and which would distract them from the lesson learned in the story. In later segments, Eve's breasts are covered by her long hair."
3,Hurry up and wait,"This book was an interesting weave of the Merlin story and the ""Song of Roland."" The last half of the book occurs after the ""Song of Roland"" and what could have happened if Roland had been a descendent of Merlin.The magical elements in this book are wonderful. Tarik is so entertaining. The author leaves some things hidden until the very end, which makes it a satisfying conclusion.However, there were parts of this book that just drug along. The romance was ok, but the whole ""who is he?"" ""who is she?"" nonsense against a larger backdrop was inconsequential.All in all, I think this is a good book that deserves a read, however, be prepared to have to dig through some not very exciting parts to get to the good stuff."
2,Debussy arranges Beethoven,"The piano used here may be the equivalent to a Porsche but it's being driven by a very timid driver - taking Beethoven's hairpin bends very warily - he can play fastish when the score says so, but it 'sounds' weak - limp-wristed. The piano here is like a sumo-wrestler getting punched by Olive Oyl - absorbing all it all in a bland half-asleep manner.I own dozens of sets of the Beethoven Piano Sonatas - to the great dismay of my poor visa-card - that's how much I love them! But this is the first time I've been bored by them. A wishy-washy, gentle, genteel, soporific set that is the antithesis to Beethoven's brusque, revolutionary genius.Pass."
2,boring,"Last night I was in my car and there was a recording of Beethoven's Sonata No. 11 on the radio. I didn't know who the pianist was and was struck by how unimaginative and dull the performance was. Having grown up listening to recordings of Arrau, Richter, Kempf, and Brendel in this repetoire I was bemused that such a dull performance as the one I was hearing would be broadcast nationally. Beethoven should never be uninteresting!!! It's such great music! Well, the pianist I was listening to turned out to be John O'Coner. I have heard O'Coner before and had the same reaction but listening blind only strengthens my opinion that his playing is pedestrian. Avoid this set. Get Arrau's or Brendel's instead!"
1,No Justice for Miss Genovese,"This book is slight in content as well as size. Essentially an essay on the Kitty Genovese case, the author tells us (twice) that he knew nothing of the woman other than her name, her age and the manner of her death. Those facts, along with a tiny bit of information about the killer and some anecdotes concerning the author's job at the New York Times and his contact with this story, are about all you get when you read this book. It's a pity that 35+ years after her death, the author knows no more about her or the case than he knew in 1964. His commentary is the easy commentary of a journalist who writes for quick deadlines, the cumulative effect of which is that, by book's end, we find that Miss Genovese' life and far-too-early violent death - witnessed by thirty-eight bystanders who failed to act - has been marginalized once more by an reporter who, himself, fails to investigate."
3,Gets the Job Done,"My computer was overheating and I didn't have any slots for more fans. This offered a good ""quick fix"" to my problem. In general, I would say to go out and buy a case with sufficient cooling, but if that isn't an option, consider this a good alternative."
5,Nice little stories for bunny lovers!,"Good intro to school terminology and activities for little tykes about to embark on nursery school or pre-school adventures, incorporating learning numbers to 100 and some fairly sophisticated words."
2,Strictly fantasy,A beautifully illustrated book but the reader must realize it is mostly fiction/fantasy from the mind of the author.
2,Buy it for the illustrations,Don't buy this book for the text. It's really not very good at all. But the beautiful illustrations are worth it. We tore up the book and framed the Illos.
5,requiem,This was exactly the product I was told to purchase. thank you for making it so easy to procure
5,A Brilliant Wild Ride,"""Edwards' and Stephen's COMING CLEAN is an unflinching exploration of every dimension of human sexuality: the good, the slimy, and the grotesque. It is a bawdy, brilliant, wild ride of a book, by turns hilarious, poignant, and scatological. The book's importance lies in its unraveling of cultural attitudes about sex and sexuality. I recommend it to any adult, especially anyone who has puzzled at our culture's awkward and inconsistent maneuverings around all things sexual."" Beth Gylys, Ph.D., Author of Bodies That Hum"
4,This should be in any music lovers collection!,"This is one of the best albums that I've heard.every songs is awesome as hell.'outcast','me against the world','visual lies','den of theives','shock treatment'and 'visions' is the best songs on the album. so if you love heavy metal then I recommend you to pick up this album and turn it up and rock out!!"
1,Dreadful,"This was the worst book I have read in a long time. I wouldn't have finished it but I think that is a character flaw. It is totally pointless. There are a few interesting characters, but the plot is disjointed and the ending--there isn't any, it just stops."
4,gently surprising,"An unusual book, filled with small surprises. The story of the murder itself is straight forward. The revelations of character in the town though are not. There is real originality here."
2,Not much here for mystery readers!,"I must confess two items, up front. The first is that I'm really keen on the Christie/Sayers/Rinehart/Tey-formula mysteries and contemporary material has never been my favorite. The second is that this work appears to be targeted more for female readers -- and, thus, not so much for me, although I read a lot of womens' reading that I much enjoy.That being said, I agree with other reviewers who said that there was no mystery here and I was also anticipating the ""twist"" at the end to pull it all out of the dump -- it didn't happen. Anticlimatic. I think a much better title would have been ""An English Novel"" and that way, one would get more of what one expected.There is some subtle psychology in the book which I credit with the second star but the alleged humor, stated on the dustcover, is about as funny as a sharp stick in the eye.I suppose this book was a-o-k for some folks but it was a big letdown for me."
1,Too Many Plots,"This is not a murder mystery; indeed, it is well nigh impossible to say what it is. The author has tried to jam 3 or 4 plots into a very small space. What is worse is that she tries to emulate P.D. James and does an atrocious job of it.Many threads are left dangling.The characters are one dimensional. The prose is at times pompous and at other times simplistic.Save your money."
4,"A fast, entertaining read","This book is very well written, and laugh out loud funny in some parts. However, I found some of it to just be a little pointless. What was the purpose of the chapter about Alison's mother? I seemed like it was just stuck in there to fill pages, and did not serve to illuminate the story at all. However, I found all of the characters to be very well drawn (Miss Crabbe is one of the funniest characters I seen in a long time) and the book was a pleasant afternoon diversion."
3,lackluster,Well written but ultimately trite story. Good atmospherics and characters leading to palid conclusion.
4,One of the smartest bands in rock...,...right up there with Ben Folds Five and The Flaming Lips. The full band sound is a great addition and the bass lines are incredible. Though it's not FLOOD(which will always be my personal gold standard) it's still great music from one of my all-time favorite bands.
4,Darn good,"This, along with ""Flood"" and ""Factory Showroom"" is one of the best TMBG albums out there. ""Sleeping in the Flowers"" is one of the best songs. When I first heard it, I didn't care for it much. However, after a few listenings, I was really into it. A step in the right direction for TMBG."
4,This was good,"This was the first CD i ever bought, and i loved it. That was a few years ago, since then my tastes in music have changed quite a bit and i have sold this CD. But i always rememver this as being a great Cd, and TMBG being the only band of their kind!"
4,"Not a PERFECT album by any means, but pretty darn good!","This is easily my favorite TMBG, ""Apollo 18"" following close behind. However, I'd give Apollo 18 5 stars and this one only 4 because this one contains more filler. But I still like it more. My enjoyment is 5 stars, but the song quality is only 4. It's amazingly hard to understand.Anyway, what good shtuff do we have here? We have the utterly awesome album openers ""Subliminal"" and ""Snail Shell,"" we have the rockers ""Destination Moon"" and ""I Should Be Allowed To Think,"" and the interesting tunes like ""The End Of The Tour,"" ""A Self Called Nowhere,"" and ""AKA Driver.""Only ""O Do Not Forsake Me"" and ""Dirt Bike"" come off to me as utterly unlistenable. It's a very good album."
5,Best TMBG Album,"I would say that this is my favorite TMBG album. There are some close seconds, but this would have to be my favorite. I like the use of the real band, and the whole album seems to have more of a ""rock"" approach than most of their other stuff. This is an album that you can listen to repeatedly, like if you're on a long drive (and if you're driving at night, you'll smile to ""AKA Driver"")...you won't be upset when your player goes from track 20 back to track 1. It's something I've listened to up to 5 times in a row before switching out the CD (yeah, I still do CD's in my car).I recall reading a review that called ""Spy"" an ""instrumental-only track"" and for those of you who have read it, that's 100% wrong. It also made me very skeptical of the reviewer because clearly s/he didn't listen to the whole album...just clips."
3,"not their best, but worth owning.","This is the first one the Johns did with a full band to back them up, and you can tell they're still sort of getting used to how to use full band arrangements but still keep the personality of the group. The good songs are really good (""no one knows my plan"" and ""the end of the tour"" in particular), but there's a few too many songs that while not exactly bad, could have been written by anyone. Of all their cds, only mink car is as hit and miss. There's quality material to be found, and it's something to get eventually, but I wouldn't make it your first tmbg purchase. maybe your fourth."
5,"Not the best, but still great!","At first(like many others) I thought album was dull.But soon, it was always in my CD Player.Every night songs I skipped began to grow on me. And now I only skip 3 songs. AKA Driver started out to be one of my least favorites, but that was before I heard the full song. I miss some of the upbeat songs on Lincoln and They Might Be Giants, but this album is still great, even though the songs are serious"
2,Bigger is not always better,"As a long time TMBG fan, I was seriously dissappointed with this album. It made me cry :-( The quirky instrumentation was missing :/ It was the beginning of the end of TMBG. How I long for the days of Lincoln."
1,I did not order for a used copy of taking charge,"I don't recall it was mentioned that I will be getting a used copy when I bought the book ""taking charge of your life"", but when i received this book I was surprised to see that i was sent a used copy!"
5,Unique book,"I collect nativites, and this gave me good information about the artists and the culture. I look forward to more such books."
1,Don't waste your money on this DVD,This DVD is real old school and cheezeball. Bad quality because of the date it was created and doesn't even come close to anything created in the last 20 years for kids. Very very bad dvd! It looks as though a 10 yr old artist made this. Characters do not talk - it is a man's voice telling the story in the background.
3,this is just part of a bigger book,"I was disappointed to find out, when I read this book to my 5yo, that it's simply one of the chapters of the original book broken out, with a few extra details thrown in."
2,Disappointed,"I loved Famous Long Ago so I expected to love Total Loss Farm--especially since I live in Vermont now. I don't. I've had it for months now and haven't been moved to finish it. Somehow his heart doesn't seem to be in it. There are somewhat interesting descriptions of his experiences hitchhiking and living on his commune. Given what a fascinating life it clearly has been, it's surprising that it doesn't ring more true emotionally."
5,Left my son wanting more!,"What a great book for my 7 year old reader!!Summer vacation is a tough time to keep the early reader engaged, but this book, purchased as part of a 4 story set (also included, ""The Copycat Crime"", Devin Grayson; ""The Mad Hatter"", Brian Augustyn; and ""The Purr-fect Crime"", Jason Hernandez-Rosenblatt)he literally could not put down, reading it in its entirety in two sittings.Fast paced (but age appropriate) action sequences, good vocabulary challenges and comic style illustrations kept him turning pages.My son reads at the ""Junie B. Jones, Magic Treehouse, Horrible Harry"" level. This was a terrific change of theme for him. He loved it so much, I came to Amazon looking for more - which brought me to the opportunity to write this review."
3,Claves,"These claves were not really what I expected. The stain/paint comes off very easily. They were intened for the kids to play however, not a good idea. Was looking for something more durable."
1,Not worth the risk,"I purhased my 1gb Microdrive less than a year ago and it suddenly died. Luckily I had backed up the photos the night before. Have sent in for the warrany replacement, which I have been waiting almost 2 months now, and have been told it will be another 3 weeks. I guess alot of them are crashing. Anyway, I would recommend going to a 512mb compact flash."
1,Unreliable and disappointing,"This drive died on me the second time I used it with my Nikon D100 digicam. I bought it when regular CF cards held a max. of 512 Mb and paid a premium for the extra capacity. I do not trust the small mechanical storage device inside, and will go with CF cards from now on. Lesson learned the hard way."
4,1GB Microdrive,"I bought two of these to get the 1GB capacity at a cost lower than compact flash. I've heard concerns about their mechanical reliability, but I have had no problems. In fact, I have to admit I've abused them, including drops from 4 feet onto tile floors, storage in hot cars, storage in below freezing cars, and considerable bouncing in camera bags.All in all, I've been very happy with them and wouldn't hesitate to buy another."
5,A beautiful book - architects and art lovers can both enjoy,"I purchased this book at Monticello, and any lover of architecture will enjoy this beautifully conceived work. The paper and print are gorgeous (reminiscent of Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information) - everyone I've shown it to can't stop looking at it. As a non-architect, at times I wished they had better defined some architectural terms, but overall the text is also quite good. If you enjoy aesthetically pleasing books, this beats almost every art book I've ever seen."
3,Needs better singers,"I like the smart cover painting and the lively direction of Mackerras. However, the cast is nothing to brag about. Come Scoglio doesn't sound good, and the rest of the arias are only okay. The chorus, however, is magnificent. Overall, an okay recording and a generous highlights disc, but there are better choices out there."
4,Valuable abriged version especially for Hadley's Ferrando,"I do not agree that the cast of this Edinburgh Festival performance 'mediocre', or 'for want of better singers'. Granted the cast is not the most even, however there are still gems to be spotted. Notably, the role of Ferrando in Cosi fan Tutte calls for a lyrical tenor of the highest calibre. Rarely will a recording of the opera contain ALL the arias of Ferrando, some being fiendishly difficult to master.Mackerras did include Ferrando's arias in full, and this highlight version wisely captured them.Jerry Hadley was an outstanding Mozartian, and his Ferrando had qualities that many top tenors yearn for but could not possess. His performance here could justly be termed impeccable and beautiful.There are three solo tenor arias in this collection, and even if the Fiordiligi of Felicity Lott wasn't the best of Fiordiligis, others in their roles are more than competent.For those who miss Hadley, this disc is invaluable."
5,z dizzle-izzle mac-a-licious,"this is the baddest underground rapper to come out of frisco in a minute, check it out you wont be disappointed, anti-nerd as well"
5,ABOUT TIME,"It's about time Z-man started exploding. ""Dope or Dog Food"" is Z-man's first album on a major record label, but he's been the San Francisco Bay Area's tightest underground rapper for years. His shows are live, lyrics untouchable, and his creativity exceeds anything else out there today, hands down. This album is tight from front to back with personal favorites ""Two Bad Ants"" and ""No Cure For Sugar"" getting a lot of replay. Any time the Gingerbread Man makes an appearance, things just go off the hook, and yeah, Z does all of his own artwork as well. This is rap originality at its best. If you're not in the know, then now's the time to start knowing..."
5,No more spam,"Since installing CA anti spam I get virtually no spam at all, its a great product,when a occansional spam does gets thru you have the option to block it so it doesn't happen again"
1,Book of Hate,"Seems to me this book was all about hating President Bush and had very little logic to back up where the author was trying to take the reader. If someone wants to talk about economics and investing and politics, just be reasonable, logical and use sound facts. This writer seems nutty."
1,Not worth the money not even for a beginner trumpet,The trumpet stopped working after only two weeks and it was not worth my money It had been by far the worst buy I've done in my life
2,trumpet,"it managed to get my boy through half a year of mandatory band, and as such deserves at least a star. as a side note, mandatory band class is ridiculous.to be fair, my boy didn't care a whit for the trumpet (he plays drums) or marching band (can't march lugging a full kit), and as he didn't care, he didn't treat it very well. hence the only half year survival of trumpet. the horn was dented rather badly after dropping it about a foot (i witnessed said drop), after which, one of the valves became warped and wouldn't submit to indignity of playing ever again.i don't blame it much for that.overall, two stars. cheap, shiny trumpet. no professional instrument, mind you, but it should do for a beginner who is careful, or anyone in mandatory band who doesn't really want to be there anyway.i still get nightmares thinking about how much it would have cost if he had dropped one of the rentals that the school offered."
4,Good priced beginner trumpet!,"My husband was looking take up a new hobby. Not knowing whether he'd keep at it, I didn't want to spend too much money yet I wanted something that was up to par if he took it up permanently.I even got him lessons. His instructor told him that it was a perfect trumpet for him to learn on.He loves it!"
2,"Looks great, sounds terrible.","I bought this trumpet for my son who needed a trumpet for school. Against the music teachers advice, I bought this product. Thought I would save $$$ instead of renting.The product looks great, but the sound is very bad. I really thought the musician, not the instrument, made the difference. But my son plays much better on a school loaner then on this.I would not purchase if you are looking for a good sound."
4,good illustration of practical Christian living,"It has been some time since I read this wonderful little book. However, it has been ""bookmarked"" in my mind as a definite re-read and a book for my library. Mr. Benson based the book on a verse in II Peter chapter 1, actually 2 verses, verses 3 and 4. It is then about being joint heirs with Christ...sharing the being. I finally found a copy of this about 2 years ago but lost it in the Dallas airport. I hope you find it or have a copy to read. because He Lives, Perry Granberry"
5,A fantastic down to earth understandable book,This book was one of the first books I read after becoming a Christian. I could thoroughly understand it and what it was saying about everyday living and loveing the Lord. It is a great book to me. I had a signed copy and loaned it out and never got it back. I use to buy them and give them to some of my new friends in Christ and have been trying to find some for a long time both to give and to have it again to read myself. I would recommend it to new Christians and old Christians alike and people you would like to know about Jesus and can't seem to find the words to do it yourself.
3,"Nice, but the heart pendant is too pale.","This is a very pretty necklace, but the pink heart pendant is very pale and did not show up well against my pale skin. The pink pendant does not go well with the red necklace. I replaced the pink pendant with a ruby red heart pendant and the necklace looks much better. I am familiar with making beaded jewelry, so I was able to replace the pendant without restringing the beads."
1,What a disappointment...,"I used this book for a university course I teach entitled ""Italian for Travelers"" and it was a disappointment. My students - 60 architectural graduate students headed to Italy for a semester abroad - hated the book because nothing is together... verbs are broken up is such a way that they become difficult to learn: 1 - 3 person singular is presented separate from 1 - 3 person plural forms, the same for numbers, articles, nouns, etc. Everything is broken down into such small parts that it becomes very difficult to see how they all fit together to make a whole. I adopted the book sight unseen because I was given the job four weeks before the semester began and it was what had been used previously... won't be used again!"
4,Colloquial Italian,Colloquial Italian is well organized and easy to use. It teaches the reader Italian that is current and useful. I liked it very much.
3,"This staking system works well, but why spend the extra $$?","I received this with my Earthbox. Since I have had this over a month now, and my plants, (tomatoes and peppers) are needing staking, I have discovered that I don't need to spend the extra money on this. They don't hold up the plants as well as the stakes I bought at Home Depot. If you just like to spend the extra money, then go ahead, otherwise, I would just buy the box and buy your own staking sticks with some twine, works just as well."
1,lousy staking system,"the earthbox itself is terrific...but the staking system they sell for thirty bucks is a ripoff big time. Flimsy and cheap--not even wire or rubber mesh, but string. For an investment of thirty bucks you can buy some heavy duty staking poles and cages at a hardware store and you could make enough for three or four earthboxes. outrageous price for the shipping and this piece of garbage. It does not deserve to have earthbox name affiliated with it."
4,Staking System Makes Growing Tomatoes Easier,System is easy to install and works well. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the cost.
4,Great Starting Gardening Kit,"I bought three complete kits on the recommendation of a friend who has about 15 of them in his back yard. If this is your first Earthbox be sure to read through the forum on Earthbox's website, especially the posts for new users, before you put them together. The staking kit was easy to set up and appears pretty solid. I will be curios to see how the nylon ""net"" holds up with exposure to UV. (Try to install the staking kit before you fill the boxes with soil and water or else it will require two people, one to pick up the end of the box and one to install the base)"
5,Guide dog,"Great quality--sturdy thick leather, heavy bells. Am strapping one set of these on my ankle so my blind foster dog can follow me by the sound....this was my vet's good idea! Working well....:)"
5,Take a trip back to the 60's,"Great performances, sound quality is very good better than most new music cd's. You can't go wrong with this DVD. If you like the blues at all this will become one of your most played."
5,Night Thunder's Bride,"The fantastic book, I read this book twice! This was the first book that I had read by Karen Kay. The georgeous man on the cover got my attention! Everything about this book was excellent!"
4,"Very enjoyable, but....","I truly enjoyed Night Thunder's Bride. Ms. kay did an amazing job describing every little detail making it very easy for the reader to picture every nuance. The romance is a memorable one, and that made this book that much easier to read.I only found one item about the book that kept distracting me from the love story. I found the setting very hard to believe in. I kept catching myself thinking ""that wouldn't really happen"", and it was never in reference to the spiritual side of the story.Even with that said, I am still glad I read it, and would still recommend it to others. Just try not to let the far-fetched aspects deter you from what is an otherwise wonderfully written love story."
5,lots of great free places,We spent 4 wks travelling across the west in our RV and only paid to camp 5 nights! This book helped save lots of money and got us to see places we never would have considered!Definitely worth the money!
5,"great album, but the 7"" are better","This is the first monorchid full length album it is the accumulation of 3 different 7"" that were re recorded. To tell the truth the 7"" are better especially the song oral fixation anonymous. Probably Chris Thompson's most fitting band he has been in, but i would definatly suggest Circus Lupus and Skull Control though."
5,I don't DO German!,HAH!!!! I do not do German!! Gift for my son--who's takinggerman in college for several semesters. He's trying to get a jump on it!!what an awesome kid!He said it's got alot more help & words than his textbooks.
4,Very good book!,"The book itself is a very good refrence. I find it very useful and tend to keep it at hand when I'm writing in German.The only thing is, I couldn't get the included software to work."
3,Its OK,"I think this book its OK. It gives you more of a theatrical background than theatrical techniques. Backgroung information of theater, though, is essential so that we could understand theater as a whole. The book includes exerpts and many short plays. Like I had said before, it OK."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Considering the picture of the item, you would think it contained 4 binders; however, it DOES NOT. It contains only one binder (I got orange). Also, when I received the binder, the rings were broken. Do not waste $9.00 on this item."
3,Disappointed,"There is only one song on here I really like. The good news is I love it, the bad news is that is the only one I love. the lyrics are good but the ""sound""."
3,Great Songs.,"Another good album from former Kansas lead singer. This has 2 great songs that are instant classics. They are ""Pass the Flame"" and ""Home With a View."" The lyrics and music on these 2 are just outstanding and very powerful."
3,"First track from movie ""Revelation""","I bought this CD because the track ""Just Believe"" was the theme song for the movie, ""Revelation"" by Cloud Ten Pictures. While that song is cool, the other ones were not as good and seem like the artist has left the bands of the past to work on his own - he is no good without the original band members of Petra. So I only listen to track 1 and then change disks."
4,Defying the Norm in CCM,"If you are looking for an album full of power, excellent production, superb compositions and first-rate musicianship in the CCM genre, this is it! Not to mention that John Elefante sounds better and better. His vocal interpretation, passion, range and quality is hard to beat (or match).Although his previous works with KANSAS and his other solo efforts have been good, what stands out most with Defying Gravity, among other things, is the lyrics. More straight-forward and uncompromising.This one is well worth the admission price. If you dismiss Defying Gravity, you'll miss out on one of the best CCM offerings in a while.While Defying the CCM formulamatic norm, this is a CD the whole family should enjoy!I'd give it 4 1/2 stars ...- Scriptor"
5,A must have!,"Great vocals, Great writing, wonderful harmonies, and masterful musicianship. This disc is filled with exciting and meaningful music sung from the heart. I picked this CD up after researching music from ""Kerry Livgren."" I knew John was a member of ""Kansas"" for a while, but I never Knew what became of him after his departure from them. I am glad this CD is now in my collection.This disc is very upbeat, and I can always count on it to lift my spirits. I would love to see John team up with Kerry for a couple of songs. They both are incredible composers with a strong faith in God, and have written some of the most beautiful music you will ever hear. This CD Defys gravity, and 95% of the Christian music on the market."
1,Want to Cheat Someone,"I made a mistake and chose the book they listed in the Amazon.com. When the book arrived, I saw that what they have listed was only a Study Guide from a really old edition. I must say that they have said this on the listing. That was my mistake. But I wrote them back that I do not want this book, and want to return it. But they do not accept the return and refund of money. They do know that it is hard to find someone again doing this mistake. I looked at the book. This is $ 10 worth, not more. And impossible to sell again. I am a student. I do not have so much money to afford the required book. So I got really frustrated and faced losts of problems in the following weeks and spent a lot of time and energy to get the right book. It is a really sad story and an experience for me. I hope the seller is right know enjoying my $ 139.71."
3,Not The Best Textbook on Cost Management,"I have purchased this textbook for self learning. I also have two other textbooks on the same subject (Hilton's and Bamber's). This is one is the worst of the lot. It is wordy to the point of distraction. The authors do a poor job clearly explaining concepts. For example, in the chapter dealing with cost behavior, their explanation on the methods for separating mixed costs into its respective parts using high/lo and least squares and etc. is mind numbingly confusing. I compared this chapter to my other two references and they both were clearer. Actually, Bamber's is much better then Hilton's - simple and straight forward. Sad to say but I may toss this book."
3,"FOR THE PRICE, THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BETTER","This book should have been written better when you consider its expensive price tag. However, the review excercise at the end of the chapter is extremely helpful. I would recommend the book if serious improvements are made. Overall, it is not that bad."
2,Too much info.,"Too bad we're stuck with whatever book the professor assigns. Often reads like the authors needed to write 1,000 pages, regardless of the complexity of the material. I caught them several times referring to the same item with different terms. In-class instruction on methods will save you a ton of time."
2,Decent..,"I believe the only reason I enjoyed the book somewhat was because I am, in fact, a big fan of Inquisitors and Chaos in the Warhammer 40K background. Otherwise, there are many things going on in this book that someone would find it hard to understand if they were not. Very dark and gloomy, and very wordy. Stay on your toes while reading it."
2,A disappointing effort to say the least,"From the slipshod cover ""art"" to the abyssmal sound quality to the sloppy performances, this nearly-bootleg album comes across as a classic ""just finishing up our record deal, now let's get outta here"" type of release. It's a real shame, as the current lineup of this band (featuring Paul Kantner, Jack Casady, Marty Balin, and Diana Mangano among others) can be a stone killer in concert. It's also unfortunate that about half of this set repeats selections (though not performances) from their 1995 effort, ""Deep Space, Virgin Sky."" Fans deserve much, much better quality, and the band isn't doing itself any favors by adding this sort of material to it's catalogue. I give it two stars as a die hard fan who owns all JA/JS and related releases except ""Modern Times."" In fact, die hard fans may be even more critical of this stuff than casual fans....all others need not apply...."
2,Where's Jack?,"The poor sound quality sinks this cd. The sound is muddy and muffled. You would never know Jack Casady is playing with the band, since you can't hear the bass at all.That said, the cd still merits 2 stars (instead of zero) for the energetic performances. Marty Balin is in good voice, although Paul Kantner's pipes are a bit rough. Diana Mangano is a Grace Slick sound-a-like."
2,"interesting, good photos","By original review was :I thought this would differ from the classic atlas format of dry statistics by emphasizing the people and natural world, but it doesn't. Check it out at the library before buying.But my daughter has read it several times and finds it interesting, so I see that I sold the book short."
4,KIDS LOVE IT.,BOUGHT IT FOR OUR GRADNSON. HE LOVES IT. PERFECT FOR A 3-YEAR OLD BOY. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT AGAIN.
1,Whaddya mean I can't return it??,"Do you notice that Amazon.com doesn't provide any track samples of this CD? That should have been my first clue. The [small] price tag should have been my second. But I got greedy and ... I got what I paid for.Robert Goulet is his normal wonderful self, but ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" done to a finger-snapping swing-type beat is more than I can bear. A few of the other tracks are okay but choose another album (ANY OTHER ALBUM!) if you want a better representation of his skills and talents.Things go downhill with Mr. Crosby's CD. The tracks seem to be recordings from live performances, perhaps even radio shows, and after about three of them, I turned it off in disgust.I'm not put off by Amazon.com, Robert, or Bing by this experience, but I will be more cautious about purchasing something that sounds ""too good to be true.""Overall, this album gets a Yech! and you can't even dance to it."
4,Strong Debut,"Hatsu shows Whiteberry's propensity for playing up-tempo pop/rock gems with strong beats and stronger hooks. This CD would be an impressive debut for any band, but the fact that these girls check in at 15-16 years of age is even more impressive. Producer Yoshihito Onda (of Judy And Mary) has helped Whiteberry forge a sound reminiscent of the Go-Go's during their latter years. Standout tracks include ""Natsu Matsuri"" and ""Yuki."" Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Resource,Easy to follow diagrams and instructions. I am able to quickly locate the information needed. Good investment.
5,Wonderful resource,I'm a clinical psychologist and this book is very useful with my child clients. I use it many times weekly. Very well done!
3,It's ok,"Bought this for the boyfriend. The card holder is a little too tight to try to position the baseball card correctly and the ball holder keeps falling apart, but it gets the ""job done."""
5,Great gift,Very nice display. I gave this as a gift for my friend's newborn baby. I put a note with a description of the ball in the card holder rather than a baseball card. It made for a very nice and personalized gift.
1,A transparent re-hashing of other people's work....,"This is an epic case of ""I copied it from the Internet"" that is a shameful testament to how easy it is to claim the work of others as original thought. This book is a sham from the get go, with blatant en masse repurposing of the works by Al Ries, David Aakers, Maister, Kotter and Drucker.Most of the book holds valuable information, but to present it without attribution suggests an ethical compass that is sorely out of whack.In a herky-jerky prose, it is clear that these authors are unsure of their service to the trade. PR? Branding? Organizational Change? The irony that it is about leadership on a clear set of principles will not be lost on those smart enough to buy something else.Not only is there nothing new under the sun, the presentation of this content illuminates like a dim bulb.Shame."
1,never got the book. emailed no reply,wat the ell been emailing no response and i never got my book got super ripped off
4,Nice movie and animation but not for young children (graphic),"I purchased this for my 9 year old twins and had to re-record it and edit out some scenes such as the people drinking water that had turned to blood. It shows the people with blood running down their faces from their mouths which I thought was a bit much for kids under 11. Also the scene with Pharoah's young son hanging dead in his arms could have been left out and alluded to only. True these things happened, but if you are not purchasing for yourself and intend to watch with your kids, beware that you may have some shocked faces and detailed explaining to do. Otherwise, it is good for adults and the animation is phenomenal even by today's standards. Short (about 30 minutes) but nice to collect."
2,Only Partial Screen Coverage for $11,"I have their screen protector for my 7100t which covers the entire screen and was a perfect fit. Had it for a year and a half and works great.Ordered what I thought was a full screen, custom fit, protector for the 8700g. What I got was a generic, rectangular skin, that covers the active screen only...leaving the screen above and below the rectangular portion exposed.Its not specific for the 8700g (specific SKU for 8700g though), but a one size fits all (8700 series), according to their customer service. For nearly $11 , NOT RECOMMENDED.** Found a truly ""custom cut"" solution that protects the entirefor about the same price with a lifetime replacement guarantee.I suggest the ""Invisible Shield"" from www.shieldzone.com/category/pda/"
5,Excellent choice!,"I would recommend this knife set to anyone...the quality is great, the look is great, and these things are very sharp. Nothing bad to say about them."
3,Anolon honored warranty,"I love these knives and have been very happy with their performance over the past year we've owned them. They look and handle great, and sharpen up wonderfully. The price is also reasonable. We read a lot of reviews and did a lot of comparison shopping before deciding on these. My only complaint before today is that they tend to get some surface rust that needs to be scrubbed off, but that is not a big deal.However, today I noticed a large crack in the santoku blade near the handle. I checked Anolon's webpage and it appears that I can send it back for replacement. I inspected all the other knives and noticed that two steak knives are also cracked in the blade near the handle. If anolon replaces them and I don't have more problems I will be very happy. I still love these knives and hope that this was an isolated problem.UPDATE: Anolon did send replacement knives- no questions asked. It just took several weeks for them to arrive. I am pleased with the warranty service."
4,Excellent knives for the price,"My wife and I bought these as our daughter's and son-in-law's Christmas present this year. They were thrilled, especially since their old knives had been dull for years. The Anolon 15 piece set is a bargain and should last for years with only moderate care. We're impressed."
5,An Amazing Read,Another favorite Susan Mallery book of mine now At the moment I am trying to read all of her books and I am enjoying everyone of them especially this one. This story felt so real at times I felt like I was right their with them watching their love grow as they grow and watch them get torn apart but come back years later. A read I will recommand to any romance reader.
3,Free Kindle edition is incomplete,"The original version of this book was (apparently) a compilation of sketches by C. Leroy Baldridge and verses by Hilmar R. Baukhage. Intended to ""serve as a record of doughboy types,"" the collection depicted the day to day experiences of US troops in France during the Great War. Unfortunately, this free Kindle edition contains none of Baldridge's artwork. The pages (and pages) of captions provide a tantalizing hint of the many and varied subjects that caught the artist's eye. Too bad we can't enjoy them here, even in black and white.On the positive side, Baukhage's poems are delightful. By turns comical, irreverent and poignant, the verses make this little ebook a very worthwhile read."
1,jessica's amazon reviewed purchase learning treehouse numbers,"The video is extreemly outdated. I run a child care facility, and used this video in conjunction with my lessons for the day, and it did not hold the childrens attention from the first moment. I ended up purchasing the leap frog numbers dvd that worked out very well.The Learning Treehouse: Numbers"
5,Real,"This is a book for adults of all generations. It is a modern classic. Entertainment filled with real-life drama (without the sap). Shameful that it is out of print. All should read it, I hear there may be a movie soon, believe it or not!"
4,Property,"As a first-year law student, I found this book to be helpful. It was clear and concise, and included plenty of hypotheticals."
1,Sour grapes from a dramatic former butler.,"When I made the mistake of reading this tell-all book,It was clear to me that the writer was very bitter. The book tells us little that shock`s,and seems to have been a means of revenge towards Marlo Thomas. What is also odd, is that not one unkind word is written about Phil Donahue,leading the reader to believe he must not have any say in his own home."
5,The Real Marlo,"Years ago a friend of mine, along with his father, worked as a doorman in Marlo Thomas' apartment building in Manhattan. He said she was the the rudest, most inconsiderate person imaginable. She had a steady stream of things to be delivered to her apartment, was always unpleasant and didn't even tip at Chistmas.I enjoyed this book immensely."
5,Holding Time Changed My Relationships,"After reading Holding Time I began to think about my relationship to my parents in a way that I hadn't before. Your book also gave me ideas for changing some aspects of my relationship with my boyfriend. Holding time gave me some ideas about techniques we could use to improve our communication in the aras that concern us (and in the areas that aren't troubling, too). We have done holding time with very positvie results. So, I thank Holding Time for changing my relationships for the better. I recommend it to anyone having problems with their parents or significant other."
1,Please get real help.,"I couldnt help but be disturbed by the unscientific nature of this ""therapy"". It may make everyone feel good, but I fear that it would delay parents getting their troubled children any real help. The author should be ashamed of herself."
1,Give Us All A Break!,"This technique was written up in Let Me Hear Your Voice by Catherine Maurice as a total, utter and absolute fraud. I am so sad that so many people are gushing over this stupidity which is only harmful to autistic children and has no basis in helping them. The insult of saying that kids are autistic since they failed to bond with their mothers should not be perpetuated and this absurd book should not be read and taken seriously by anyone."
1,"Why is suffering ""therapy""?","At least one high-functioning autistic person who was subjected to ""holding therapy"" as a child has said that ""the suffering was terrible and it achieved nothing"" and described being ""shocked into a state of terrified quietness"".Given all the effort we put into teaching children to say ""no"" and resist when someone tries to touch them in ways that frighten them or that they don't like, I wonder precisely what ""holding therapy"" teaches them?"
5,Holding time a great success!,"We used 'holding time' for those times when our older daughter went completely out of control: hitting us, spitting, trashing her room, won't stay in timeout, etc. It was very successful for us. So successful, that we almost never use it now. My wife and I found Holding Time complementary to Rosemond's 'Making the 'Terrible' Twos Terrific.' Ignore the author's insistence that the technique only works for mothers. It works with fathers, too!"
1,Can I get a quack please!,"This book was written by a quack! It's blaming parents for their child's problems. In this day and age we should know better. AdHD and many other problems in children metioned in this book are chemical and biological. This is a cult group! Please take time out to see that, if someone told you you were in a cult at least investigate. This approch is out dated. If you have a child with Autism, read chapter 16 in a book called ""Let Me Hear Your Voice"" by Catherine Maurice, please before you start this Holding Therapy."
1,not good,"Working in an elementary school, I have come across many children with problems, a few of the mothers tried ""Holding Time"". It was a disaster as they did not know how to cope with their children's tantrums. The children became harder to deal with resisted holding, saw it as punishment. This is not a technique to use without professional guidance."
1,disgusting horrible book and method,She should be arrested. It is child abuse essentially. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK and READ ABOUT CHILDREN WHO HAVE DIED WHILE BEING TORTURED.
5,One of the best!,"This is the 2nd Ween album that I picked up, and I must say that it is top notch!! This is pure WEEN"
1,This record is absolutely terrible,"I would never say that I am a huge Ween fan, but I do enjoy their music frequently and own a few of their albums. I decided to buy ""The Pod"" and have regreted that decision ever since. I understand that it's a low budget recording, but if they spent such little money on making the record, then why should the listener spend so much money to buy it. The album is entirely unlistenable and I beg you not to make the same mistake I did in buying it."
1,"Just 'cuz it's WEEN, don't mean it's good.","I am a big fan of WEEN. I want to get that out before I get some truth all over you. This album is practically unlistenable. I know we all want to be cool and in-the-know with a cult band, but gimme a break! I'm sick of albums that ""challenge the listener."" It's not fine art - it's bad music. I was told the album was made when Dean and Gene locked themselves into a studio, got way high and started recording. I don't know if that's true, or even close to true, but the album seems to back up the story. I get the feeling that, to this day, the WEEN boys are laughing at the joke they pulled on their fans."
5,"Unlike anything, PURE GENIUS","if you are not familiar with ween, like the others have said, do not buy this album first.At first listen i thought it was kinda crappy, but then after each listen i could start to hear the music. wow, indiscriblibleone of the best moments on the album: stallion part2abcdefghijklmnopqsstallioneasily one of the best albums ever"
4,not for non-weeners,"Unless you are already a fan of really good garage band music, then this album is not a very good Ween primer - try Choc and Cheese or Pure Guava for that. However, if you already know that you like Ween (especially their more crazy, freaked-out side) then you'll like this a lot. This album is where these guys started, and by the time they're finished, they will have played every style of music known to human-kind. I gave only four stars because even though I really enjoy this album, I can't bring myself to call it one of the best around."
1,Pure Slop,"I've read these positive reviews and I can see merit in most of them, but I will say that this is by far the worst Ween album ever. Yes, it takes patience and concentration to listen to and ""appreciate"" but, these songs are not lo-fi masterpieces that will make you laugh and cry or whatever. Yeah, they're funny, but I can make funny songs with a 4-track and my bong. I can enjoy an album that takes weeks to get into, but I cannot sit through this album long enough to let it penetrate deep into my psyche and then reveal itself in all it's gloriousness. I wish I could distribute a record of me and my roommate doing the same thing and then have people praise me online. If this was a record made by, say, The Goo Goo Dolls, would y'all still lavish it with the same praise? P.S. I've decided to give ""The Pod"" another try. I will listen to it with an open mind and then make a more informed decision."
5,Laughed so hard I was cryin in my Pollo Assado.....,"When you bear in mind the fact that Dean and Gene Ween claim they huffed six cans of scotch guard while making this album, and were evicted from their home afterward (the aptly named ""Pod"") you may end up in fits of laughter listening to this one. This album is alot more sluggish than some of their other albums, but shows the band's progressive alternative rock stylings with flying colours. The one song ""Pollo Assado"", more of a recording of a hazy order for munchies at a taco stand, had me in stitches. ""Sketches of Winkle"" is the ULTIMATE punker tune and ""The Stallion Pt 1 and 2"" are nothing short of bizzare and absolute surrealness. Any song on this album named after a woman are an absolute scream. There is NOTHING this band cannot or will not do. If you are looking for a Ween album that is ecclectic in every sense of the word, pick this one up. Bow before the almighty Stallion!"
2,The Master Game,"The book I received was the hard copy of the book that was shown in the picture. I wanted the soft cover so, although I technically have the book, I'm not particularly satisfied. I'm not the type to complain, so I'll live with it."
5,The USS Enterprise and Pearl Harbor,"June 18, 2001Dear Sirs:The first paragraph of the review I submitted on June 17, 2001 should end like this:....it is an excellent source document for military historians with much important new information about the military action of this carrier during and immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.Thank you for your time and interest.Ralph Peterson"
2,a heap of rubbish with a diamond at its core,This book is an insult to one's intelligence. The subject matter is incredibly important and the data conveyed by the book is impeccable and relevant. But the mode of delivery is atrocious. It is a book full of cliches. One would think that the sexual abuse of males would drive us to the outer limits of intelligence and imagination. This book utterly fails in that drive. Surely better books exist that deal with this dread topic?
5,Hard book to go through but good one at the same time,"This is the hardest book I have ever read and I have read some very hard books. This is what makes it so good - it hits home. As a survivor of a pedophilic scoutmaster, I never found much comfort discussing what happened to me and people usually tried to say something for a ""bandaid"" fix. This book explains why I had the feelings I did and how to overcome them. Much appreciation to the author."
2,skip it,"Published in '91, this is not a timeless classic. Instead it's one of those books that gets worse with age. Whiney in a non-entertaining way."
3,"Not bad, for the price","This relatively inexpensive portable GPS navigator performs pretty well for the most part. I use it in the Los Angeles area, although I recently took it down to San Diego, where it performed very well in getting me to my destination. It sometimes takes a minute or two to find the GPS signal when first ""firing it up,"" but works well once it does. I noticed that diamond lanes sometimes confuse it. Rarely, it makes an outright error as far as turning left or right. As other reviewers note, it does not voice the name of the streets, only the directions, but one has to spend a lot more to get this feature. Like computers, there is no doubt that better ones will appear on the market at comparatively lower prices; but for the time being, I can honestly say that I am satisfied with this device (which I nick-named ""Max."""
2,Inaccurate map and difficult to use,"I bought this unit from Circuit City during the Thanksgiving Sale in Nov. I thought that it was a great deal but I haven't really figured out how to use it well. The interface isn't intituitive and I consider myself tech-savvy. I have used Garmin a few times in rental cars and I didn't have to read user manuals. For the MIO I had to download the user manual (they don't supply it with the unit) but even then it isn't easy to use.Additionally, what prompted me to write this review is that it has inaccurate maps. I had trouble in Arlington, Mass (near Boston) yesterday when the map had a stream and kept asking me to take that and sent me in circles when the street didn't exist on the map.Also, there website is really basic and doesn't provide any good technical support. For example, one can't ask questions over email or get technical support. Can you beat that in today's age?Gaurav"
4,More than Just GPS,"I Never had any other GPS before, so I'll give it 4 stars based on my Satisfaction with this Unit so far.-I like their built in Miomap software. 3D view is great to see streets around, and the dragging function works just like google maps... minus sattelite view of course .... maybe one day.-Bored of Miomaps? Then Load up TomTom. Don't like it ? How about Installing Iguidance ??? 1GB internal memory is not enough ?? 2 GB SD !! .. Their MP3 Software sucks?? install winamp !! Long trip ?? Play some DIVX movies in your extra SD card .."
5,Very Nice,"This is very nice GPS. If you want very simple and essential GPS, this is what you need.Except this has small LCD screen but this is fine for me. I do not use MP3 much, but if you do is will be even better."
1,No Customer Support,"The Mio Digiwalker product is ok but their support is non-existent. I have called them over 9 times, from Sep 2007 to Feb 2008, to get an RMA completed. Each call took an average of 1/2 hour. They have no idea how to treat customers and God forbid you ever want to return something.Trust me! You will NEVER get your money refunded, even if they issue you an RMA. This is by far the WORST service I have ever experienced. This is not a crank review, it is the truth, HONEST!!! I guess I will have to take them to Small Claims Court to get my money refunded. Then I will try to get the Newspapers to recount my ordeal to warn others."
4,Mio 310x not THAT easy to use but ...,"The Mio 310x GPS device comes with instructions on how to navigate menus, what buttons do, etc, but does not teach a beginner how to start and until this day I don't know how to only erase my last entry. I wrote to Customer Service and did not get an annser."
3,OK,"I have owned this unit for a little over a year and have done some extensive traveling with it.Pros - auto switch between day & night modes is awesome - tough to go back after having it.Battery life is good & cordless option is great.Cons - The mapping software is terrible! If you have any idea where you are going it will drive you nuts! If staying on the highway one more exit will save you time it does not recognize it. The directions it takes from my home to office are almost 20 minutes longer! Having said that, if you don't know where you are going it will get you there just the same!Overall it is not a bad option & way better than a car load of maps. I just upgraded to a TomTom One & love it. The mapping is far more accurate but it takes navigating through several menus to switch the screen to night mode."
2,Mio c310x Portable GPS Car Navigation System is Good but Invision GPS From SupportPlus is Excellent,"I got MIO c310x in BF deals at Staples and I was excited to have GPS within $150.This unit is good. If you compare this unit with the Invision (SupportPlus Inc unfamiliar name in GPS), Mio look just OK. I got Invision for same price on Cyber Monday deals at Staples. This is also European product but it is really Nice. Invion has whole bunch of features at a price of $150. Auto recalculations of route, MP3 as well as Video.Biggest Cons of MIO is not using Navteq Maps. Secondly, reception and fixing location of vehicle delays by 2-3 secs. This time is enough to miss the roads in downtown.Get Invison GPS from Staples. It do not have Bluetooth and Photo Viewer but it has everything what you can expect in $500 + GPS. You can play your movie on GPS too."
2,Rating my Mio,I bought this item because I heard from two other owners that they really liked the features and performance of this model.I have used it as a new resident in the area and it is very helpful for finding my way around.I find the storage limited for MP3 files.
4,Good and non-expensive product,"The mio c310x is cheap and reliable. Althought he POI is not updated with new developments and all POI out there, for a price of less than $200 you get a good deal and an MP3 player included."
5,wonderful,"I cant see mylself living without it for now on , everywhere i go i take my GPS with me , i live in Sao Paulo (Brazil), wich is the 2nd biggest city in the world , and it works perfect , I love everything about it . And it takes me wathever i want to go ."
4,mio c310x,"I like this product.However I have some problems with it.I send e-mail to mio-tech,but didnot receive answer.I have Windows Vista OS,so I cannot use my USB cable.I cannot use MP-3 neither."
3,Poor Battery Life,"Purchased my c310 this past December when shopping for Christmas presents. Works well and gets me where I need to go, but there is one very annoying and potentially dangerous problem. If the unit is not being used and is not plugged into an AC or DC charger, the battery life is about two days. When I'm not using the GPS, I keep in my glove box rather than inviting someone to steal it by leaving it out in the open. After two or three days, when I go to use it again, I have to re-enter the date, time and time zone because once the batteries die, the unit loses this memory. I called tech support and all then could say was...""keep it on a charger"". All I can say is, don't take it on a five day hiking/camping trip and expect to find your way out of the woods using this thing."
1,don't buy,Maps are out of date and Mio does not have map updates. Mio has said they would have the updates for months now.
2,Very Uncertain,"I have a purchase a Mio last year 2006,love it at first but some reason it nevers gives me the fastest route EVER. We always go to the longest and scenic views in new jersey. I was doubtful when we went to new york it work great there but not in jersey. It is very easy to use though. They have to update their maps to. I like the looks and thats it."
2,Great if you don't mind 2 year old maps,"I bought one of these back in 2006 at a black friday sale for[..]. Great price at the time. I does the job ok, [..]. There was ONE map update released around August of 2007, but none since then. [..] If you're ok with 2 year old maps, then by all means this is an acceptable unit.On the plus side, it is hackable and you can easily access the underlying WinCE operating system."
3,It's OK but,"The Mio 310x is OK, especially for the price paid.The problem is not with the unit itself but ratherwith the tech support. If you purchase an updatedisc from Circuit City , you will have quite ahassle in getting it to work. Took me numerousemails and telephone calls before getting a personwho could help me."
1,not worth the money,"Don't buy this! It takes forever to figure out where you are (and by that time you've driven by the turn you were supposed to take), and then it gives you the wrong directions -- I tested it out at home and it told me to travel in circles. Very difficult to enter addresses, and it doesn't have many points of interest near me. Plus it doesn't come with an AC adaptor or a stylus -- the only way to charge it is in the car. Very cheap of them not to include that. I'm sending it back and getting a Garmin."
1,WORSE GPS,"This is got to be the worse GPS that I have ever own. First it did not work out of the box, tried top download the map-it did not work. I tried more then once to contact for customer support and did not receive any replies.For those who rate this high, good luck to you, hopefully it will work and you will not need any support.Finally decided to buy a Garmin 340 and it is terrific."
3,"OK, but not that good.","This thing has a lot of pros, like well made, good looking, nice user interface etc. I only want to point some cons comparing with my Dell PPC + Dell gps receiver.1. I only used twice, this thing both gave me some routes on small street as another reviewer said, it doesn't know which is ""main"" street.2. Just before a turn, no alarm at all.3. Not much quicker or similar to lock satellite signal.4. More delay in updating current position on map."
3,Mio C310x user review,"I will just mention problems I experienced during my trip from Philadelphia to LA.Some of the roads are not real and recent road information is missing.- I lost my way in Birmingham, Alabama to find 78 from I-20. Mio C310x directed a road that is not exist.- The new road from Birmingham, Alabama to Memphis (future I-22?)is not updated yet. It mis-directed several times.- Often the map shows a left turn sign but the voice directs right turn. This was found when I was changing from I-15 to I-10 (LA).And, the most serious problem was when I missed the direction indicated by the map. Automatic re-directions always guided the original route even after passing quite a lot (go back or turn back). Finding alternative new routes were serious problems.Overall, Mio C310x looks fine for finding final destinations, but one should be careful when driving unfamiliar area. Recommend to have Google Maps directions too."
1,l get lost with this GPS,"Review: I was excited by the many features of this MIO C310X at first. The hardware looks stylish and compact but the software is another story. I need to carry a menu and a FAQ forever in order to do simple things such as storing an address or program a destination. If I need to modify or correct an address entry, God, please help me. I still can't do it. If you can't program a VCR on a fly, don't buy this product. Also, Florida has hundreds of number roads such as State Road 19 or County Road 454 covering many thousands of miles. This device has none of those streets name. I can't use this GPS on any of those streets. Try to program this business address: 3001 State Road 19 Tavares FL 32778 and see for yourself"
1,"Not poor support, non-existent support","I bought three of these, one for each of my parents and one for myself. It is a disposable unit because they do not offer map updates like other companies. As time passes, it becomes less and less useful. I could write about the pretty good UI and hardware, but the fact it is a throw-away unit makes all of that pale in usefulness.I would have bought one for the other car, but the lack of map updates made me get a Garmin."
4,Good value for the money,"I like this GPS because it has all the features I need. Its maps are upgradable at a reasonable price. It's really compact, very portable, can play music through the SD card slot. All the maps are in its own memory (1 gig internal). It allows you to set wave points. Though I don't care much for the mount because it's bulky and it has limited freedom to move it. All in all, it's a great product that I would recommend.Cold Eyes"
2,You've got what you've paid for,This is really NOT GOOD compare to Magellan 3000T. But I went for this since it was much more cheaper and smaller.Cons:1) This MIO GPS is about 50-100 feet from the exact location which ends up to give you to the wrong turn.2) Not easy to use at all even for me a GUI SW Engineer. It gives way too many features which confuses you even more.3) Battery runs out pretty fast: less than an hour of use after fully charge.4) Car charger kills this GPS several times. I had to reset several times.5) Car charger can never charge this GPS fully.6) Not easy to save your address book.7) So many times it tells you to turn back (u-turns).Pros:1) Small and compact.2) Nice 3D big screen and colorful.3) Power up & down very fast.4) Many features if you spend days to learn and figure them out (not very intuitive)
1,Broke down on me after 2 months,"I admit this GPS works well when it's functional, but mine turned out to be defective. It broke down after 2 months and would not switch on at all. Tried reset and charging for a day, but the power just completely died.I had Fry's send it back to the Manufacturer and the typical repair time is 6-8 weeks, worst case 14 weeks. It's annoying that the product fails something so simple, and it's disappointing the repair process is so long."
4,Does its job well. But not perfect.,"I've used this little unit for over a year now and I have to say that it works well as a gps unit. It has nothing fancy like bluetooth but in terms of getting you to the place you want to go it is highly effective. Rerouting is fast and it uses the Sirf III chip just like the top of the line Nuvis. The company itself is getting bigger by the day and their website is getting better, but support is definitely not as strong as that of bigger companies. The menu system is effective but does require a little getting used to. People new to GPS systems should check out the cheaper alternatives with garmin which is easier to use. If you're looking for an effective cheap GPS unit it's hard to find anything better than this.Overall I have been pleased with this device and would buy it again."
2,From Great to Garbage,"This is a great little unit. I was really impressed with all the features, and yeah, it had a couple little quirks (like it doesn't read my SD card) but nothing that wasn't overridden by the rest of the unit's greatness....until I got the map upgrade a week after I had the unit and KABOOM...now the thing will not respond due to a limit in memory, at least that is what it is telling me. I have contacted support on numerous occations with no response (they say within one workday, but good luck). Now I am the proud owner of a really cool looking chunk of plastic that I can suction cup to my forehead and act like the jerk I am for buying this thing. All I need now is to return it and look for something that actually functions!!"
5,The Denver Broncos video is a must see for any football fan!,"As a die hard bronco fan, i would give this video a 5 star + rating. It givies an in depth look at the broncos history, numbers, stats, and plus it gives you a review of each and every 16 reguler season games, plus a look at thge wild card game, 2 playoff games, and the super bowl. it has interviews with the owners, coaches, and players of the denver broncos. it shows you locker room meetings, and celebrations. It is a must see for any football or denver bronco fan!"
5,Wonderful!,This is an awesome CD. This group ranks up there with some of the best a capella groups out there...
3,Over the Shoe Boots,"Although not yest used as of this writing, they look fine for light use. In my situation, as a motorcycle rider, they are purely for emergency use with being casught in the rain."
1,niceeeee boots,When i got this nice boots to my daughter she had a nice ssmile on her face and i was smiling and feeling so happy and closed my eyes and said Thanks Amazon.For making that smile on my child face.Thanks Amazon.
2,Did I get a lemon?,"The look is nice but doesn't do the trick for me. I pumped it and hardly any oil came out. Some drops of oil shot out and mostly air is released. I checked the rubber ring, I used peanut oil, I used olive oil, that didn't make a difference. I'm still wondering what I can use it for. I hate to throw it away."
2,Not worth it!,Not a fine mist at all! It will spray for 1-2 seconds then it just streams out oil. Don't get it.
1,Great until it stopped working. No help from the company.,"I try to watch my fat intake. When you eat a salad with oil laden dressing, you defeat the purpose. It is difficult to pour just a little bit of oil onto a bed of lettuce. But I find it unpleasant to eat a salad with no oil at all- the condiment does not stick to the lettuce!The plastic misters they sell at the store are junk. They squirt out in globs, and then they start clogging up.This product is great. A very cool stainless steel container (easy to keep clean). You fill it 2/3 with oil, pump it up and it sprays a fine, well regulated mist, sort of like what you would get with an aerosol butter spray (Pam). It costs a few dollars more than the junky plastic ones but it is well worth the calorie and fat savings.Follow up comment. Dateline 8.31.11 (Less than a year later), sad to report that the thing started leaking under my sink. Manufacturer ignored my email for any advice. Cannot any longer recommend this product."
2,i had such hope!,"I use olive oil religiously and hoped that the Micra Mist would allow me to ditch the Pam once and for all. Didn't happen. In fact, the spray (if you can call it that) is so weak that I end up oiling the pan the old way. I, too, wonder if my product was defective. I specifically bought this once because it had the most positive reviews. Oh well."
4,"""The Witch"" is a beauty!","Steeped in historical ambiance, ""The Witch from the Sea"" provides a richly entertaining look at the arduous, yet strangely beautiful life of seafaring privateers in the nineteenth century. The heroine, Tory Lightfoot, is a hardy adventurer worthy of Anne Bonny and Grace O'Malley. Tory meets life with courage and grace, reveling in the demands of her chosen career, set on proving to herself and the world that there's more to her than meets the eye. To my mind, Lisa Jensen has a written an exemplary tale of courage and romance. A rare find, I look forward to the sequel!"
4,A sexy read,"I really enjoyed this book? It was well-written, sexy, and a good page-turner. Tory Lightfoot is a convincing character, and the author brings her adventures on a pirate ship dramatically to life. Romance, adventure, and a satisfactory (and beleiveable) conclusion. Can you hear my applause?"
4,Joseph's story in claymation,"This is a 30-minute animated film of the biblical story of Joseph. The clay animation is nicely done, and the writers did a good job with the condensation and adaptation of the biblical text--capturing the most important parts of the story and sticking relatively closely to the biblical account.I couldn't help noticing, though, that Joseph and his youngest brother, Benjamin, look much more European and much less Semitic than the ""bad"" brothers who sold Joseph into slavery. Because of this, I hesitate to recommend this film for children. But I've used it in college and high school religion courses and simply drew students' attention to this issue.I also recommend ""Ruth,"" ""Abraham,"" and ""Jonah"" from the same series."
5,First Years Compass Adjustable Booster Seat,"Everything I expected and very happy with it. He is a ""big boy"" now! Love that it will be used for years to come with being able to adjust it to fit his growing body. May be ordering another for my older son as it would work for him too!"
3,"Great seat, but old manufacture date","We purchased this seat for our 3.5 year old daughter in December and she absolutely loves her ""Big Girl"" seat. She also has the Evenflo big Kid seat in another vehicle and she says she likes that one better. Overall, I like this seat. It's easy to use, and the fold up option is nice. I wish it would also convert to a backless booster as many others have the option for. I think the biggest disappointment was that I ordered it in December 2010 and it had been manufactured in 2008. So, I thought I was getting a seat that would last until 2017 when I ordered, but this one expires in 2015 so we'll end up needing another one. I don't know if there's any way to find out the manufacture date when you order. I would advise not letting your little one be around when you take it out of the box as mine was. She instantly ripped all of the tags off so once I realized the old manufacture date, I could no longer return the seat :("
5,Excellent Booster,"I did a lot of research on the best booster out there. I tried to like the Britax but the head wings were not for my daughter, she likes to be able to see outside and I know her safety should be more important but on long car trips there must be a happy child in the car. So we tried out the Compass and we could not be happier. It was rated by Consumer Reports as excellent, the same as the Britax. It has the side impact material. It fits her frame well, she is petite and tall. She is 4 so she is old enough for a booster and understands all the rules that go with it. She is very comfortable in it and she loves the bells and whistles. The cupholders and the arm rests. It is also so easy to fold and take into another car or leave with a friend, no more big bulky chair to drag around. I highly recommend it!"
2,Not thrilled,"I bought this car seat for my 4 year old son. He meets height/weight requirements for the seat. However, the seat slides around with him in it. I do NOT feel it's safe for him at this time. I just took it out of my car and re-installed his 5 point harness seat. He hates the old seat and is not happy, but I'd rather him be mad at me but safe! The booster is easy to use, using only the lap belt, but I feel I have sacrificed safety for ease of use. I reccomend keeping your child in their 5 point harness seat for as long as it is safe for them."
1,Not safe: Seat belt lays across bottom of neck,The seat belt lays too close to the neck. A safe booster seat should be set up in a way that the seat belt goes over the shoulder. I tried adjusting the headrest to see if the position of the belt would get better but it didn't.
1,"Cheap, but crappy.","I purchased this item so my daughter would have a car seat when we flew home to visit my folks. Amazon delevired, it was there when I needed it, no problem. However as for the seat itself, the design and shape is crappy. When the child falls asleep in the seat it is not designed to properly support them, also the way that the seat belt goes through this particular seat is badly planned and I belive it hurts the childs back during a drive of longer than say 20 minutes. The seat is rather inexpensive but even free it would not have been worth the price. I suggest that you find a different seat with a better support design than what is offered here."
1,IS IT GREEN OR BLACK&RED?????? IM CONFUSED!,THE PICTURES AND MODEL LET ME ASSUME ITS LIME GREEN BUT THE COMPLEMENT SAYS RED AND BLACK...PLEASE REVIEW AND LET ME KNOW!
3,NURSING SHIRT,"I GOT THIS SHIRT FOR WHEN I START TO NURSE MY BABY THOUGHT IT WAS A COOL IDEA AND IT IS, BUT THE FABRIC FEELS NASTY, HOPEFULLY IT WILL FEEL BETTER AFTER I WASH IT."
1,Broad Sweep,The author attempts too broad a sweep in this popular history. A glance at the rather slender bibliography indicates a strong religious bias; a more balanced view is required. There are the distortions typical of a single volume when complex events are condensed. The author would do well to consider Irish sources as Gaelic-speaking Scotland and Ireland were a single cultural entity for more than a millenium. To consider the history of one without the other results in an incomplete record and debatable conclusions.
3,Not great for oily skin,"I disagree that this product is appropriate for all skin types. I found that it made my oily skin very shiny. While it might work well for people with dry or normal skin, I think there are better choices out there for people with oily skin."
1,very disappointed,This product had a water texture and it is hands down one of the worst mositurizers I have ever come across. Please do not waste your money.
3,a bit greasy and no easy way to dispense the mositurizer,"The bottle contain a lot of moisturizer, so in that way, you get a lot of bang for your bucks. But the only way to get the moisturizer is pour it out and I often pour out a lot more than I needed. Because of this, I think I will go through this bottle (4 oz) quicker than my usual cream moisturizers (typically 1.7 oz). Also, maybe due to extra (unintentional) generous pour, my face often feel a bit greasy after I put on the moisturizer."
3,just ok,"I wanted something to use during daytime, but I am using it at night time as this looks greasy/oily on me...I would not recommend"
2,watery moisturizer,"I usually really love Loreal products, but I'm not impressed with this moisturizer at all. After reading all of the great reviews, I was expecting a nice thick, soft moisturizer, but when I opened the bottle to try it out, I realized it was very thin and watery. I put it on anyway and it did absolutely nothing for my skin. I won't be using it again."
3,"Not bad, but there are better animes out there","The basic premise of this Grenadier is a gunslinger advocating peace and refusing to kill anyone. The beginning episodes show off the main character's marksmanship well and got my hopes high for the rest of the series. Unfortunately, all the fights are either against opponents who have zero chance of actually meaningfully fighting back or against someone with a cheesy wacky power who will then give up fighting after their weakness is finally exposed (except the fight at the end against another grenadier toward the end which was absolutely awesome). If they had edited this down to a six-episode OVA it could have been great. Grenadier is good enough to pass the time and you may go back to re-watch the highlights, but is ultimately a poor copy of Trigun which is an all-around better anime."
4,Definately worth watching.,"A slapstick humor that, when combined with a few good fight animations, makes this a really good fix for boredom."
5,Jogging Down The Road,"If I could have the 7 years of The Golden Road bound, I would read every magazine without stop! I missed the 80s - in fact I didn't start down that road until '93 - and have been a scholar catching up ever since. Goin' Down The Road: A Grateful Dead Traveling Companion is an excellent road map and companion and I thank Jackson for everything!Also, the book was in excellent condition. I hate buying 2nd hand books but these guys produce the BEST! Shipping speed even surprised me!"
1,American conquest fight back,Did receive it quickly..thank you...but I had also spoke with a live person to explain we needed it in English and to go online with it we needed a login I.D. she told me the game was unopened so it would be intact.. When we received the game...it wasn't in English and it didn't have a code to go online with...so we are very disappointed..I would like to return the game and if there is one that is in English and has an I.D. login to play online I would like that instead..How do I go about getting the correct one? Can't rate it properly because couldn't play itS.P.
4,This is starting to get interesting. . .,"If you've read my review on the first volume of the ""Eagle"" saga, you know that I wasn't particularly impressed with it. Well, I have to say that this volume had me truly enthraled. Particularly the ""debate"" between Yamaguchi (? sorry I can't quite keep his name straight) and Albert ""Noah."" The whole buisiness of 'is it better to train the sheep or the sheepherders?' really had my attention. I found my self arguing with both men. I'm still not absolutely certain that this book is a keeper, but the fact that I was internally debating the characters is a good sign (for me, anyway) that this novel is going somewhere. So far, this has been the best novel in the series. I'm looking forward to reading more. I won't make any other comment than that - I have to read more of it before I can say yea or nay to it."
2,bad disk,"I bought this Spenser story and was looking forward to viewing it. However the disk was poor and skipped about. It''s my fault I didn't go through the trouble to send it back, but I always think that a new disk should not have imperfections. So it's not the seller's fault but mine, that this gets a poor review."
3,Repeatative and needs page numbers,This is a great serious for anybody who needs maps for papers. I have two complaints though.One is that if you look at some of the maps in this book and the The Palgrave Concise history of eastern europe...they are the same maps. If you are going to have to books...make them different at least instead of having 50 % of one book being the same as the other.Second is the page numbers...there are none. In the table of context it gives numbers for the maps...but no pages are listed there or in any corners on the pages...you have to flip through the whole book to get the page you need. It gets annoying sometimes.
2,Could be better!,"Stella Dong's book on Shanghai, while interesting, is limited by Ms. Dong's mediocre and repetitive writing and sensationalist tone. Individual parts of the book can be very interesting, but are not organized into a well written and cohent whole. If your looking for a serious historical work with some good analysis this is not the book for you.On the other hand, it is a decent intoduction for someone planning to travel to Shanghai."
2,"Misses the mark, but has its positives","I live in Shanghai part time and this book is interesting to me because I can walk around the city and imagine... but the book seems very biased and is more interested in sensationalizing the city then a true analysis of the wonder that is Shanghai. In a way I am saddened by her reflection because it runs down the same path as most 'Westernized' views of China; I realize that this sells books, but when will authors take the responsibilty of serious reflection about place and significance rather than feed the reader with exotic half-truths. Before I ramble more (my highscool grammar teacher will cry if she reads this), I would suggest that one decide what they want out of a this book before purchasing... If you want a decently engaging story - this is ok... If you want to know about Shanghai's 'essence' look elsewhere, Stella Dong misses the real story and the real city."
5,Lively and evocative history,"I had the opportunity of attending a lecture and slide show the author of this book gave on Shanghai recently at the Elmhurst library in Queens. It was an absolutely riveting talk. For an entire hour, Stella Dong transported us into another world. We were shown slides of Shanghai from its beginnings as a treaty port until the Communists entered in 1949. But it was more than history that we absorbed--we had a sense of the time and place. As a result of the talk, I bought the book,read it and can vouch for ""Shanghai's"" living up to the city it's eponymous subject. One big disappointment, though, is that the paperback doesn't have photos in it. All the same, Stella Dong conjures up the spirit of Shanghai in its glory days with such vivacity that the photos would only be an appetizer."
3,Decadent pleasures,"Stella Dong's bid to enter the ever-burgeoning world of ""lite"" cultural histories of important world cities (such as the city studies of Jan Morris) is nothing if not entertaining, and her account of life in the ""Old Shanghai"" from between the Opium War and the Communist Revolution moves along with a wealth of all sorts of interesting social tidbits about a city that was notorious site of decadence and pleasure-seeking for decades in the West and East alike. Because the work is somewhat gossipy and lightweight in nature it might have benefitted from a sharper sense of humor and irony, or from a more personal point of view (all of which we see in Jan Morris's work). At the very least, it needs at least some photographs of its primary locales and figures, and also clearer chapter subdivisions--at times, the book just seems to grind along somewhat from topic to topic with little direction. But it still is a fun overview of a very fascinating site for the colonialist imagination"
2,Skip it,"I rarely encounter books that are so overblown it feels like running up-hill trying to get through them, but this book certainly made me feel this way. Stella Dong, I have come to discover, is a journalist and as such really loves to make inflated claims and quote people non-stop. Really I'm only reading this book right now because it's the only one I have to learn more about Shanghai. I use the term 'learn' very loosely and with a great deal of caution. Her writing is so sensationalist I have trouble trusting a lot of what she says. The search continues..."
5,Best Marley kids' album yet,"This cd is great. It is both smoothe and relaxing, intense and sensitive, and even fast and upbeat. Stephen does some nice chanting on water and oil. I totally recommend this cd to someone who likes variety and not just the same boring sound,(i.e. Spirit of Music)"
2,Didn't care for it that much,"I prefer to hear the voices and the words of the carols, and this one has too much other sound (maybe even the use of massed voices); I have a hard time hearing what they are singing."
1,The worst book you can buy,"This is the worst book you can buy, this book doesn't teach something about 3D Studio, and if you know a little about you can understand alone how to work with IPAS, you really don't need this book,instead of it you have to buy the IPAS."
2,Not impressive,The product frequently needs to be tightened and it does not put out enough salt when grinding. I am less than impressed with this product for the money I paid.
1,"Wonderful product, but order elsewhere","I had ordered the Peugeot Chateauneuf pepper mill as a gift last year (from another site). My sister-in-law loved it!!! I'm told it's a truly wonderful product. I decided to order her the matching salt mill this year and Amazon had the best price so I went for it. When the package arrived (undamaged) I was shocked to open it and find that the mill was not wrapped in anything and was simply rolling around in the box. There are scratch marks around the top of the mill, a small round blemish, and scuff marks in several areas. It is in such bad shape, that it actually looks used...well used. Aside from having to return this product, the thing that disappoints me the most is that the box actually had the ""air pillow"" type packing in it. Pointless!!! For another 10 seconds and one piece of tape, someone could have actually wrapped this product in that packing and had a happy customer."
1,Do Not Buy,"After purchasing EZ maintenance from Amazon I contacted the manufacturer of the software to buy an additional user license. They told me the software was ""pirated"" and they could not sell me an additional user license. I provided them with EVERYTHING that came with the software (directions, manual, ect) to prove is was not pirated. They then informed me the software was sold at a price lower to the agreed amount and would not sell me the aditional user license. Stay totally away from EZ Maintenace software."
1,This is pirated software,The Software from the manufacturer is $2500 bucks. How is this being sold so cheap?Doesnt matter..........after using the program for 2 years I can tell you that its not worth much.Very old and outdated.......like it was written in the 80's to run in a DOS environment.Stay away.......very far away!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"ABSOLUTELY, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF GARBAGE. Sorry to shout, but I've never had so much frustration over any company's products like I do with Linksys (with the exception of Microsoft's useless networking hardware). This card often fails to see any active networks, and, if by chance it does happen to see a network, and, by luck you actually connect to one, then don't expect to stay connected. Buy the Netgear or D-Link adapters instead. Those companies aren't dedicated to mediocrity like Linksys and Microsoft."
3,Works...for a while!,"I purchased this network card about a year ago. i had it running on Windows XP systems with no problem, before any XP drivers came out. it is simple to use and simple to set-up but after you have it for a while, the internal circuitry starts to go. Windows will begin to have problems with it and you will need to unistall and reinstall it many times. Eventually, as with myself, it just stops working. You recieve a Code 10 error and nothing works in attemps to resolve the issue. Linksys stops supporting the card as soon as a new version comes out and then it goes out of warranty and are stuck. The tech support I spoke with said to me that they don't create any drivers after a new version of the card comes out and that I was out of luck and have to buy a new card."
3,Average performing card,"This card offers acceptable performance for the price. I was able to establish a wireless link between a laptop and Linksys WAP on floor and a laptop on another floor, but the signal does deteriate quickly and you won't get much more distance than that.If you want the best performing wireless card, I've found Lucent Orinoco cards offer superior performance to the Linksys cards in idential environments. However, the Linksys is more affordable, so if you just need a basic card, this one might do the trick."
1,Try something else,"I spend 6 hours speaking with the folks at Linksys, trying to get the adapter to work on a Sony Vaio running XP. Nothing worked. The software which came with the card was buggy and appeared unstable"
5,VERY SATISFIED,"We've set up a wireless LAN in our home (it's 2-stories with 4 laptops, so that seemed easiest) and we are enjoying the convience. We use the WPC11 with the BEFW11P1 and get good connectivity all over the house.The card was easy to set up with the installation disk (we often set our houseguests up with their own card for their visit), as long as you make sure to coordinate the settings with the router. Their is a one-page instruction sheet which was easy to follow.We did have a problem with one of our cards, which stopped working one day. We returned it along with sales receipt and received a new one 2 weeks later, no hassle. Linksys tech support has been generally helpful with a reasonable response time."
2,Fair product,"Installation was easy within Windows 98, I had no difficulties in installing the driver. Documentation is weak on using the configuration utility and be prepared to wait over 20+ minutes on hold. Signal range is widely overstated on the box. I'm not getting the range I expected."
2,"Wireless range overstated, installation difficult","I bought a Linksys wireless system largely based on PC Magazine's rating, which stated that installation was simple even for a novice. And, Linksys claims an indoor range of 300 feet. I bought the WPC11 wireless card along with the BEFW11S4 wireless router. I'm neither novice nor pro, but my experience was an extremely difficult installation, requiring three calls to tech support over a two day period. Then, when it was finally up and running, the effective range turned out to be approximately 22 feet."
4,"Decent performance, easy setup.","I bought this card with the Linksys WAP, and hooked into my Linksys 4-port Cable/DSL router. Setup was quick and easy, with not much effort under Windows 98. (I am probably more technically savvy than the average end user, though.)All in all, I got the network set up in under five minutes, WAP and card configuration combined.The drawback (and the reason why the fifth star wasn't earned) was due to the dropoff in transfer rate. I can go through a couple walls through my apartment, but it definitely falls off quite rapidly.Anyone have experience getting this card to work under Linux?"
2,Good card if you don't have to go far away,"I like my Linksys equipment. But in my cinder block Hawaiian house, the wireless hub is on one end, and not more than 40 feet away, I can't reach the dining room table or the kitchen, where I prefer to watch movies stored on my Linux machine.I even got past the problems with the XP install and it works like a charm sitting right by the hub.This card needs some more boost....."
1,junk,will only work within 15' of the base stationlinksys says my problem is environamentalwe will see
2,Good luck installing if you're not a not a network pro,"The manuals for these products (wireless access point, network card, and PCI adapter) assume a LOT about their users' networking background--which is puzzling since the products are being sold at mainstream retailers like Best Buy. I was simply trying to build a wireless home network between two computers and share Internet access, and I am disappointed by the experience.Linksys tech support takes FOREVER to respond, and the prevailing attitude is, frankly, aloof and impatient--two qualities I don't want to deal with when I need help installing a company's products. It should be obvious to the tech support people that if someone is calling for assistance, the odds are they DON'T already know the answer to their question. I could virtually hear these folks rolling their eyes when I pressed for more than terse, canned answers.After this experience, I won't be buying anymore Linksys products."
1,Why Amazon Delivery Sucks for Linksys Wireless Adaptors,I ordered a Linksys Wireless Router and the Linksys Wireless Adaptor Card on Nov 9. The router arrived in < 5 days. The Wireless Adaptor Card has not arrived. It is the 18th of Nov 8 p.m. w/ an Amazon promise date for the 19th of Nov. What good is a Wireless Router without the wireless card ????My first and last purchase from Amazon... they said in stock!
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM,I never received this item from Amazon. Amazon website was telling this product is available . But I received an email from Amazon telling this item is no longer available and they cancelled the order
1,Is not compatible with IBM Thinkpad T22,"I purchased several of these cards recently and became very disappointed. Several attempts with three identical cards on several different IMB Thinkpad T22 laptops produced the same results. Placing the cards in the machines resulted in the machines suddenly shutting down. Several calls to Linksys culminated in their admitting that these cards do not function on Win 2000 machines that have the second service pack installed. Prospective buyers should be wary of Linksys tech support. I was forced to make several phone calls before I was able to speak to a competent individual. A single example of the incompetence I dealt with was a second level technician who told me in no uncertain terms that a one-gigahertz P3 was not a powerful enough processor to run their product. Perhaps my experience is isolated, however, I will be taking my business somewhere else."
3,"Works fine I'm sure, but watch out if you're using Windows M","I bought this card along with the neat Linksys Router/WAP and went to install it on my Win ME equipped notebook. After many frustrating attempts to get it to work, I had to call tech support where the various reps I talked to were generally rude. The first one I spoke with actually hung up on me!Nonetheless, turns out the card has issues under Windows ME (even though the manual clearly has Windows ME installation instructions?) so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are using another operating system. I purchased a D-Link DWL-650 and it works like a charm under ME."
1,Does Not Work and Tech Help is Bad,"I could not even get the drivers for the card installed! I called the tech help desk and it took one entire day to speak to someone. Finally, they said it's because I'm running Windows 2000 and I need to download a new driver from their website. I did that and my system still wouldn't load the driver. The drivers on their website was older than the drivers that came on the CD. Afterward, it took another two days to reach someone at tech support (they said they will call me back and they never did), and then they said if I upgraded my operating system from NT 4.0 to Windows 2000, the drivers will not install and I'm out of luck. I'm never going to buy their products again."
3,Average capabilities,This unit worked as advertised but short on distance. I have 98 SE and this unit was the only one that worked for me. I tried others but 98 would not run them. I'm satisified with the results but wish it had more range.
1,Linksys can['t make it work,"I would strongly advise against purchasing this item. I just bought one and spent nearly five hours trying to get it working. That includes 1.5 hours on the phone with a Linksys representative. When he said I had to reformat my hard drive, I terminated that conversation.Then I tried email support. After following two or three links they sent me, which essentially had me repeat what I had done over the phone, I gave up.Then I got a call from Linksys and spent another 45 minutes with a representative. In the end he said he couldn't make it work on my computer and I should return the item.I have used this same computer with a ""generic"" USB wifi stick for over a year. After the representative gave up, I borrowed a D-Link wifi and installed it without any problem."
2,Happy until...,I purchased a PCcard last December (about six months ago) and have beem mostly satified with it until about two weeks ago. This is when the card started to act flaky. Over a very short time it went from a little flaky to being unrecognizable to WinXP (PnP would just shut the card off). I checked it out in another system (Win2K). The card had the same problem.Linksys support is not being very flexable. I explained to them the problem. I am at work and the machine is at home so they will not do anything. They will not step through their trouble shooting steps with me without the machine. They will not even tell me what the steps are.They may replace the card but I don't like the service!
3,"Works well on windows, has driver problems in Linux","The card does a pretty decent job on windows box. No installation problems. Works very well.This card is WPC11 v4... this means it has a different chipset than the older versions, so it is not identified on Linux box. But there are ways to get it done...(thats the fun in linux :) ) with some difficulty and lots of googleing. I finally did it.Although Linksys does replace your WPC11 v4 with older WPC11 v3 if you send it back to them requesting the same."
1,Not that good,"I know you get other people saying that this works great and even ""works fine"". That's why I purchased it. After I got it up and running I was thrilled. I went from my home office to my kitchen with my laptop and lost ALL connectivity. In my bedroom I was getting 13% signal strength and that was directly over my home office. The tech support numbers on the side of the box were all disconnected on 9/21 when I tried to call. After reading other reviews that there is an inherent problem with the card (read these after I got the product) so I returned it. I did research on the Cisco Aironet. They have the most miliwatts for transmission and reception. You get what you pay for. If you want this for a home office and you do not want any wires to be run,.. it's fine. If you have a PC in the next room and again no wires... fine. Try to go farther than that and you should get something more powerful (and more $$$)."
1,Linksys PC Card v3 - Don't Do It,"I am an IT professional with 14 years of experience. I have the Linksys wireless hub and love it. I have been using the Orinoco PC card with the hub and have been very pleased. I bought a new Dell laptop for my wife. I bought the Linksys PC Card v3 to connect the Dell laptop to the network. The Linksys PC Card's performance is (bad). I have now tried the Orinoco and Linksys cards head to head in the Dell computer. Where the Orinoco card gets a good signal, the Linksys card gets a poor signal. It also appears that the Linksys driver locks up the Dell laptop when restoring from a sleep or hibernate state. I have not experienced the lock ups with the Orinoco. I attempted to update the firmware in the Linksys card, but I couldn't get the upgrade program to work, it was looking for some system files that did not exist. Do not buy this card, even if you have had success with other Linksys products."
1,UNuseable range (30 feet) in average house!,"I (and others) can only get about 30-40 feet max. range inside a house. Totally UNUSEABLE, so I returned this too. Does anyone know of an 802.11b that does get 100+ feet INSIDE a house, thru several walls/rooms?"
4,"Fine product, but range of Access Point has disappointed","I have used this product for several years with no problems. I have found customer support to be helpful, available and (usually) knowledgable.(Linksys wireless access point has also been fine, although I have been a little disappointed about range. We get a low signal (but still usable) at 50 feet. Not impressive, but servicable.)"
1,"Linksys has a good reputation, but it didn't work","I purchased this card and the Linksys USB adaptor to set up a peer-to-peer network between a notebook and a desktop. After several days I gave up. I was never able to make the connection. Technical support would only tell me if I had the configuration set up properly, but stopped short of helping make a network connection. Following the suggestion from some of the other reviews I read, I returned the PC card for a Netgear card and tried to make the connection with the Linksys USB adaptor. Still, no success. I ended up returned both Linksys componants and purchased like Netgear hardware. The connection was made almost immediately and I have been happy with the network since."
3,"Easy Installation, though limited range","The installation (under Windows XP) of this card, and configuration to work with Linksys's base station went extremely smoothly. The range (in a large, brick and stone house) has proven disappointing, however. Also I believe, but have not had a chance to confirm, that the card becomes somewhat flaky when it overheats in my Toshiba Satellite 1555CDT notebook. I would be cautious if your notebook computer is prone to high heat."
3,"Whoo, talk about a pain!","This device is a royal pain to hook up, it took over 2 hours on tech-support to finally fix the problem. However the people at tech-support were VERY helpful with the problem, also though it took so long to hook up using it's a breeze. The range is also great however if you have steel beems in your home or office this could make the signal not very far broadcast, but still giving a ""not bad"" range! WORTH ALL 3/4's the money!"
1,No Luck,"No luck... I tried vainly to get the Linksys WPC11 Wireless Network PC Card to work in my Sony Vaio with XP Pro. The USB wireless works great, but I was unable to get this one to work. Plus... it seemed to create problems with the laptop, with it booting to a point and then crashing (unusual since I've had XP) each time. Others have stated it works, and more power to them. I'm a relative novice, but did follow the directions carefully and had previously successfully installed the Linksys access point and router on my Win98 desktop (on my DSL line) and the wireless USB unit on my Sony laptop and all works great."
1,This is a defective product,"Linksys should not even be manufacturing this POS, let alone selling it. I have gone through two of these, each lasting about 4 months before completely dying. My third one is on its last legs now. The antenna is so flimsy that normal use will make it loose, and eventually the card will stop working completely. Stay away from this at all costs, and if you bought one make sure you keep your receipt."
5,Great,The notebook adapter arrived quickly and was in like new condition with software! I am very pleased!
2,Good for as long as it worked,"Easy to install and use, but didn't last very long. Stopped working after a year or so. Same problem with the Linksys wireless access point. They aren't built to last."
2,Too Hot to Handle,"I am using the Linksys WPC11 Wireless PC Card in a Toshiba PentII 400 laptop. My laptop will lockup when using this card. I believe it is due to overheating w/ the card. When I remove the card, I can access Windows again, but my connection is lost and I need to reboot. The laptop has never hung using any other applications or devices.The card gets extremely hot. I do not know if this is due to the card overheating itself, or my laptop heating up the card. I intend to try this in a newer laptop soon.As for the performance of the wireless card, it works pretty well. I get a signal in every room of my apartment (its not that big though), and even with a 20% signal, I get good speed to the internet still. The drivers were easy to install and configure on my Windows2000.I have heard that some other cards have a much better antenna than this one, but this one seems to do the trick for me."
2,Random Disconnects,"Among the 4 wireless cards in my mixed home network, the Linksys WPC11 has proven to be the least reliable. It's had a tendency to lose connection with the base station (Microsoft MN-500) at random intervals (typically 1-2 drops every 6 hours).Bear in mind, this is a sample size of one. It may simply be a faulty unit.Overall, I've had good results with Linksys products."
2,There are better values,I returned this card the same day I received it. It worked right from the start but the signal strength was horrible. I had a weak signal no more than 30' from linksys WAP. Bought 3com XJACK instead. Much better.
4,Toshiba users read,"I too was skeptical when I read the reviews that were written. However I decided to try anyway, and I did have problems. My Toshiba Satellite Pro 4340 would not recognize the card at all. I downloaded the latest drivers for the WPC11 from Linksys website and everything. I almost gave up and returned it.Instead I tried one last thing, I went to Toshiba website and downloaded the newest drivers for my PCMCIA slot for my computer.Then installed the card and it worked great. So the point is, Toshiba users, get the latest drivers for your PCMCIA slot before you return it. Works as advertised, little less signal rate than I hoped, but it works just fine."
3,Indoor poor quality of signal,"By the time I got to the other end of the house(approx. 55 feet) the signal was gone. I tried raising my router, no help. The antenna on this card seems very poor."
2,Connection problems and so-so suppport,"Communication between the laptop (pc card) and access point is not consistent. Most of the time I can't connect to the network even if the laptop is next to the access point. Linksys support was not very helpful. I own Windows XP, however, Linksys support does seem to have the right documentation for Windows XP so they were providing directions that would work on Windows 2000. Eventually they told me to return the card because it's defective. I had the same problems with Windows XP and 2000."
3,Windows Me Installation Problems,"I had the worst installation problem with this PC card. First off, LinkSys is fully aware that the installation CD that shipped with this product has major issues. Nowhere in their web page do they even care to mention this. I spent several hours uninstalling and installing various ways but couldn't get it to load. Technical support took over an hour onhold waiting on the queue. A tech support finally resolved this problem. It turns out this is a common problem with Windows Me."
5,"I love it, great card.","My friend and I spent an hour trying to compare this card with DLink and SMC wireless PC card, and we both felt this card is the best. The driver is newer (no installation problem like DLink), the make quality is good and the thing I like the most is it has two LEDs (display link status and activity) compare with others. The link quality is very good - just as adveritsed.I recommend it."
1,I can see the antenna but the WPC11 Can't,"I bought this card with the Wireless Access Point DSL/Cable Router. I figured sticking with the same company was a smart move... WRONG! First things first the technical support is non-existant and more like the insult line. You call Linksys, they insult you by telling you to sit around waitng for them to call back and then.. they never call back! I am actually in view of the antenna not even 6 ft away from me and the card is reporting a 22% signal strength with a 5% link quality. I am going to try the Lucent Orinoco Wireless card that everyone else is talking about and return this card as soon as possible, Linksys certainely dropped the ball on this one!"
2,Weak signal; unreliable.,"I was quite disappointed in this card. I own several Linksys products (Wireless Access Point, Cable/DSL Router, et al), which I am very happy with. However, this card was a disappointment. I had poor signal reception (and thus low/no access speeds). It finally quit working alogether after a couple months. I was expecting exceptional performance, based upon the specs. I had trouble just staying connected across the room from the WAP. I tried the card with other WAPs and had the same problems. I've had much better experiences with a couple of older Orinoco cards. Linksys's Wireless Access point is great, but pass on this card."
2,Just so-so -- not for ME.,"I've bought a lot of Linksys products over time and always liked them. This is an exception.First the installation problem: the drivers it ships with don't work with Windows ME. Neither do the ones that you can download from the Linksys web site. I managed to get a copy of the ME drivers from Alex ...who wrote an earlier review of this product and had similar problems -- somehow he managed to get them to me faster than Linksys.With the drivers from Alex, the product installed and worked correctly -- provided it was within line of sight of my BEFW11S4. The signal degradation got really bad after that and since I wanted to use the card to use my computer in my bedroom (50 feet and 2 ""stick and drywall"" wall away) the 20% signal strength did not cut it.I returned it and ordered a Lucent Orinoco card. I bet it will work better and install more easily."
4,Good wireless experience,I installed the WAP and the WAC for use in my home. After a few initial setup problems (as one reviewer said - networks are not for the uneducated) it has worked great. I have installed it on Win ME and NT laptops. The range spans an entire three level house. I have cable modem high speed access and everything works flawlessly. I am in the process of buying another.
2,XP Trouble???,"This product is NOT compatible with Windows XP Professional.I found this out the hard way trying to us it. This will cause your laptop to blue screen and reboot upon detection of the hardware.If you find a way that it can be done, PLEASE let me know!!!!"
1,Linksys WPC11 Wireless-B Notebook Adapter,It took a looooooooooong time to let us know they did not have this product.
2,Disconnects,"Drops connection at times. ipconfig /renew sometimes works to correct things. Most often, I have to reboot the computer or reboot my linksys access point. I do not recommend this adapter (or for that matter the base access point)."
2,Will Not Work with Window XP Home Edition,"Do not buy this card if you have Windows XP Home Edition. I would recommend Microsoft's wireless adapter card if you have Windows XP. It works great, it has never disconnected, and always has 'Excellent' strength."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I OWN TWO OF THESE UNITS. ONE WENT OUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND THE OTHER TOOK TWO MONTHS TO QUIT. CALLED THEIR TECH SUPPORT . WAITED ONE HOUR TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO WAS NO HELP AT ALL. BOTH UNITS SEND BUT DO NOT RECEIVE . WENT TO THER WEB PAGE SOMETIME IT IS UP, BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT IS DOWN. DO NOT BUY THIS CARD IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE..."
2,"Works, but very poor range","Specs-----Compaq Armada 1750 w/ Windows XPLinksys WPC11 v3 cardLinksys WAP w/ Signal BoosterI guess I should be happy that this card actually works with my Windows XP laptop given the other reviews, but overall I'm not happy at all with it.With my laptop sitting on the floor 1 foot from the Access Point (WITH a Signal Booster may I add), I wasn't even getting close to a 100% signal. When I get around 20 feet or so, the signal barely holds itself at poor and frequently drops to 0.This seems to be a common problem among notebook wireless cards (my PCI cards get very strong, often 100% signals). I don't understand why they can't add an antennae of some sort to improve performance. Right now, I can't have the laptop in any room other than the one that the WAP is in (even then I usually get poor connections) and still get a signal."
2,Not a Practical Network Device,I've used this product with an 802.11b Linksys Access Point for almost a year. My laptop would sometimes FREEZE such that I had to perform a hard reset (remove all power including battery) - very frustrating. It was easy to demonstrate this phenomenon by attempting to transfer a file larger than 200MB. Signal strength might effect frequency but FREEZEing still occurs at the best strength. In my opinion this product is not a practical network device. I've since returned to using ethernet cable 99% of the time. My advice is to spend more for products that work well (we use 802.11b at work - no problem) or wait for the technology to mature.
4,Great wireless card,"I needed this product for my laptop which I used inside my ""very wired"" university campus.This card is a definite winner, just plug-and-play with my Sony Vaio FXG210. The setup is simple and the driver interface is very user friendly.Plug this into your PCMCIA slot and wait for the OS to detect it. Then run the installation program from the CD. My only complaint was that the software sits in your system tray and can't recognize when the card is no longer in the slot.The card worked beautifully - it tries hard, even picking up a signal from a wireless access point across the hall.4-stars"
4,great product for the price,"I own a few different types of wireless cards and the linksys in my opinion is a really good product for the money. Yes, you can buy 802.11b cards with longer range.. for example the Lucent Orinoco silver card I have gets about 10-20 feet further than my linksys but it also costs more . When my friends are setting up wireless networks I always reccomend this card."
1,Welcome to the Linksys/XP Nightmare,"I only have one thing to say about this card. Don't do it! I purchased it last night and spent the better part of 4 hours trying to get a decent signal from even 3 feet away from my BEFW11S4 access point. Needless to say, after much frustration and de/reinstallation of the different drivers and ""tweaks"" from Linksys regarding XP, I finally gave up. As an IT professional, there is only one word to describe this product - JUNK! One more thing, the manuals are absolutely abysmal. I am returning it today and purchasing a Netgear card instead."
1,Horrendous,"Apparently, the dowloaded driver created an MSVCRT.DLL:rtlgetntversion error message which froze my Win 98 machine upon restart. Three hour-long conversations with hardworking Compaq support staff in India and my poor machine remains stuck in some form of safe mode. I await a call from ""second-tier"" support.Linksys staff were quick to blame Windows and offered no support.Buy something else."
1,Perfomance degrades over time,"This card worked initially, but over 6 months it had more and more connection problems untill it just stopped working."
3,Works well until it drops the signal,"In short, this card installs easily and has pretty decent range. One critical problem that took many tech support calls to resolve: Signals are randomly dropped every few hours and you typically need to restart to reconnect. I have read now that this problem is somewhat common.The issue is incompatibility with a number of laptops/ethernet controllers/PCMCIA controllers etc.I have IBM T20/Win2K running a Texas Instruments CardBus controller. This card DOES NOT work with that controller. Period. Therefore, it will always be ""flaky"", ruining an otherwise fine performance. RMA (return) may be a problem since you typically get a replacement, which will not work by definition.Other cons - the card overheats..."
1,Horrible Support,"I'm sick of always getting book reading foreigners as tech support. Give me a break.The woman I talked to had me reinstall the card, doing exactly what I did the first time. When that didn't work her solution was to reinstall windows.Genius.Using windows 98 by the way on an older compaq laptop by the way."
1,can I give negative stars?,"I purchased this item with a linksys wireless access point. Got the access point working quickly, but simply could not get the linksys card to connect. The card was detecting the signal, but couldn't finish the job. I tried to find troubleshooting info in the supplied materials and on linksys's website, nothing.Then I did a newsgroup search and it appears alot of people have had this problem. This hardware revision of the linksys wireless card is incompatible with the linksys access point!After linksys tech support wasted my time with a run around support call I went out and purchased the Netgear card. Amazon currently sells it for about [price] more. And it's not just a matter of working [price]better, it just works! Popped it in and had it working in 5 minutes.The access point works great, and is probably easier to configure than other brands, but I will never buy another card from linksys."
2,weak technique support and hard to install,"I fighted millions of times trying to install this card on my Dell Latitude c610 (win2000). I never had good luck except a couple of times. I routinely got the famouse Code 10 and Code 31 errors in the hardware installment wizard. Even if I was lucky to have it work, I had to do the installement again after I shut down the computer.There are not much techinique support from Linksys website. I tried their solution to my problem. But no luck at all.What made me feel so bad was that I could use a Lucent PC card without ANY installment. I pushed it in the computer, it worked immediately."
1,GARBAGE,"I have purchased three of these, and one PCI card for my dad's computers.Guess what... Like my experience with ALL OTHER Linksys products, it didn't work. Locked my dad's PC up, and the cards were insanely difficult to get working, and two DIDN'T work at all. Considering that I've been doing Networking for over 10 years and wireless for over two, I figured it would be a breeze.WRONG. Called tech support, and what a joke. Waited over an hour, got hung up on, called back and waited over another 1 1/2 hours before I gave up and returned ALL of them to the store. Purchased a Netgear USB adapter for my Dad and Lucent ORINOCO cards for the laptops and they worked FLAWLESSLY. Better range, too as with the linksys, I could only wander on one floor. With the Orinoco I can go to the pool which is across the street and have access.STAY AWAY FROM LINKSYS!"
1,Don't buy this product,"I've spent 3 days and have talked to over 6 different Linksys support people and still don't have a resolution to my problem. I'm no neophyte either... I've been working with computers since the early 80s. This is some of the worst support I've encountered in my career.I've also purchased Linksys BEFW11S4 so you can add this product to the ""don't buy"" list.I just hope I can get a refund."
3,Nice functional product if you don't own XP,"A great little card for the dollars you pay, however, operation with XP has been troublesome. Firmware Update are due to be out ""soon"" says Tech support, but for this reviewer who is running XP, power management and dropped packets have been a problem... Looking forward to the imminent updates."
2,Wireless Network PC Card - Very short range,"I set up a wireless network with the Cable/DSL Router, a USB Network Adapter for my desktop, and the subject PC card for my notebook. The installs were easy, but required a call to tech help. Primary disappointment was the range of the PC card for notebook. Not good at all. Would recommend going with the USB Adapter for the notebook. It's a pain because of the connection wires to USB port, but the range is much more than the card. I'm returning the card."
4,Works well,"I had no problems installing the drivers and bringing this card up under Windows 98SE, and had good connectivity with a Linksys wireless router. Some minor complaints: The status LEDs on the card are very dim, especially outdoors; the Link LED gives no indication that activity is happening on the link; and the drivers don't bring the link up at boot time until you've logged on. This means network drives configured to reconnect at login fail with an error.I have no VPN problems with the V4 card -- I'm composing this review through the standard Windows PPTP VPN for about an hour."
3,It's cheap and it works. Range could be better.,"I own two WPC11's (PC Cards) and a Wireless PCI with a WAP11. Running on Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. Haven't had a problem yet with connectivity, unless I'm out of range. I can use it in my two story house, but not in every room. Had a problem with getting 128bit WEP to work, but I finally ironed out the problems. Setup was a breeze, took maybe 10 minutes to get it working. Haven't had a problem with any drivers. Had to call Linksys Tech Support to get clarification on whether the WPC11 would work on an IPAQ w/ PocketPC 2002. Their definitive answer...NOPE! Said I HAD to get a WCF11 (Wireless Compact Flash). Word of advice...don't call their tech support, email them ..., the techs doing email are more knowledgeable by far."
2,Does not support Windows XP,Does not support Windows XP and the setup program really (...) on Windows 2000. Other then that is ok. If you want one I have it on (...). Buying a DLink. DLink works with XP and installs in seconds.
3,Works good only in the same room,line quality and signal strength go poor just 20 feet away from the base station. Works great if in the same room or in line-of- sight.
2,It Works....barely,"I have four of these cards and the Linksys Wireless AP/4 port switch (which is great!) and my basic problem is distance from the AP. The drivers do not yet support XP. My advice, get the AP/4 port switch and Orinoco Silver cards. The Orinoco cards work great in XP, and Linux. Additionally, better connectivity to the Linksys AP/4 port switch."
2,a bit of a trick to configure,"I decided to set up a wireless LAN in my home. I had at my disposal 2 DELL True Mobile 1150 NIC's and this WPC11 from Linksys. I had heard very good things about Linksys NIC's and how easy they are to configure. Well, they are not easy. I count myself more than technically proficient with PC's and setting up networks. I called in my friend, a MS certified Professional... we just couldn't do it. Maybe it was us, maybe it was the card. In short, we just gave up and used the DELL True Mobile 1150 NIC."
2,"Decent Product, poor range and utilities","It is a well built piece of equipment, but has some flaws. First, the wireless network i am on will only let me connect in a certian area, but I can walk around, and still get reception where I could not connect. Second, the reception seems poor (from manufacturer's specifications) and it doesn't go very fast. Third, the documentationa nd the utilities/drivers are poor and very lacking. Also, from what I hear, the tech support is terrible.Bottom line- Dont go with this one..."
1,Forget this product if you are running Windows ME,I purchased the Linksys Wireless PC card and returned it the next day This card has serious issues with Windows ME. I could not even get the drivers to installed. I purchased a D-Link card which works like a charm. I can't stress enough. Do not buy this card if you are running Windows ME!!
1,Update on my previous review.,"Since I wrote my review 4 days ago, I got a Lucent Orinoco silver card and installed it in my PC.It installed on ME in less than 5 minutes, and worked great with reliable 11Mbps connectino to my WAP in the same location where the Linksys card was unable to connect at all.The Linksys WAP is great, but don't buy the Linksys PC card. The Lucent one is great!"
2,LinkSYS USB unit far better,"I bought LinkSys WAP and both PCMCIA and USB NICs. The USB device appears to have twice the range and far more reliability than this PCMCIA device. If you have both a PCMCIA slot and an available USB port, you're much better off using the latter.By the way, I bought two of the PCMCIA devices and both exhibit identical behavior. Go with the USB..."
1,Linksys [Stinks],Linksys [stinks]. Netgear is by far a better product. Not to mention their routers are made out of aluminum rather then plastic. If you want a serious PCMICA card get Orinoco PCMICA cards. They have better security and are just the best period.
1,WEP with XP Home Edition extremely unreliable,"With either 64-bit or 128 bit WEP, my laptop running XP Home Edition can not reliably connect with my access point. I have a Netgeat MA401 on another machine and it works flawlessly. I am returning the Linksys and getting another Netgear MA401."
1,It doesn't work with HP6000 with W2K,"Link never up. After call tech. support, Linksys told me that the Texas PCI-1420 card bus controller is not supported and will not be supported soon.It should list the limitation as part of spec. []"
1,"it works okay, but if you get it working don't touch it",I made a few changes to the card settings in the configuration utility that came with the card. It has not worked since. I changed the settings back the way they were in the beginning. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the software/hardware a half dozen times and I've still got problems. It shouldn't be this hard. There have to be better wireless cards out there.
1,Got XP? Stay away.,"The WPC11 is not well-supported for use in Windows XP. Today, I finally gave up on the beast after numerous efforts with Linksys tech support to get it to work (and after getting one replacement).I also replaced my Linksys 4-port router, because it stopped working after less than a year of use (got a D-link, with the added bonus of a built-in print server, for only $... more).The Linksys corporate web site raves about its explosive growth rate. For me, that's meant a real loss in quality, long wait times for help, and a web support site lacking in current information.My advice: stay away from Linksys. I got a Microsoft USB wireless adapter today. Worked right from the start, and got excellent reception."
4,Real tricky thing for configuration,"I bought this card for using in our University. I don't know any information for the access point. At first no signal can be received at the default configuration. When I asked my friends, they changed the default SSID from ""Linksys"" to the name of our university, it works!Later on I found the SSID can be changed to ""Any"" if your don't know exactly which SSID is correct for you."
4,Very Good Product,this procuct is very good you can set it up to connect to multiple wireless access points. it was a little tough getting it to connect to the wap11 version 2.2 but when linksys came out with a firmware upgrade all the connection problems were resolved. Kudos go out to linksys for putting out a great product that does not put you into the poor house and always taking care of thier customers.
2,Cover range is too SHORT!,I have left a review on the wireless router as well that the cover range could only go less than ten feet in door without any blockage in between. I returned both back to [amazon.com].
4,PC Card works great.,"I was a bit worried about what version of the card I would get based on other people's reviews. I got version 3 of the card and the range on it is fantastic. I have a 2600 sq. ft. house and the Linksys hub/transmitter is in the basement, I got 80-100% signal strength on the second floor of my house.Install was a bit tricky with Windows 98 because I did not have the original OS cd, but Windows 2000 Professional worked with no problems.I highly reccomend this product!"
4,"Easy setup, good for most of my needs","I was able to easily set up the wireless network card. The throughput was not what I hoped for because of the distance from the base unit, but is adequate for most needs except for backups which can take all night. The protruding part of the card is the antenna, and it needs some clear space around it or it won't get any signal at all, i.e. the link light starts flashing if you bring a hand too close to it. Otherwise this product is a good alternative to running physical wires and good for laptops which need to roam about."
3,"OK card, terrible manual, no customer service","The Linksys card worked fine in 2 laptops, connecting the the Linksys wireless access point and then a DSL line. I then had trouble getting it to work in a Desktop Windows 98 machine. The manual was useless. I went to their web site and found I had to disable the NIC ethernet card I was using previously -- things did not work until I physically removed it from the computer. The manual suggested I uninstall the driver, without saying how -- doing so required DOS commands. I found some useful info on their web site, once I sorted out the errors in the commands their instructions told me to use. When the card did not work on reinstall, I then called tech support. Someone took the info and told me a tech support person would call me back. Twenty-four hours later I still have not gotten a return call. I eventually got it working and it seems fine -- the product is OK, but the manual and support are not. I'll try another company's product next time."
2,PC Card's weak,I tried the Linksys PC card and it work only in line of line conditions. 30' and obstucted it does not work. 3Com's PC w/ XJACK is only a little better. I recommend the Linksys USB. It is not as compact as PC card but powers from PC and you get use to it.
3,For Laptops only !!!,"The card (I bought 3 ) works fine in a Laptop. It configures easily and drivers take just 30 seconds to install. However, when trying ti use it in a PC tower with the necessary WDT11 Adapter Card (PCI slot), there was no way, Joe.!!! It was absolutely impossible to install drivers let alone configure--spent hours on a Win98 system, tried WinME and I do this for a living and know my way around this stuff. I finally ret'd to Amazon 2 cards and 2 adapters. I ordered the USB (WUSB11) and it worked perfectly both in driver installation and configuring. Just be sure you get the V2.5 USB with the small antenna."
4,"Great once setup, but linksys service [is not good]","The reason why I gave this card 4 stars, not 5, is because of Linksys' service. I called them few times during weekday and weekends for some setup help, got through the busy tones after redialing their number 20 times, and then I was on hold for about 45 minutes to an hour before anybody came on the phone. That was their shortest hold time.....other times I just hung up. I almost had returned their card and router at one point in time....once this card is properly setup with your wireless network, it works great....i have a 4400 sq ft house with a basement and back yard, and my laptop works great anywhere, including the basement and the back yard....just wish they make their technical support qaulity better and hire more people."
4,Great Product,"This card was extremely easy to setup. I have 3 computers on my home network and once I had one set up, all I had to do was insert the card into the other 2 machines, configure the software to connect to the network and that was it. The only downside is that my laptop battery runs out faster with this card installed-- significantly faster. My roommate has this same problem. If the card didn't suck all of the life out of your laptop, it would be perfect.I have been able to take my laptop outside when the day is a nice one and the signal from the Linksys wireless router even reaches through 2 exterior walls and across about 60 feet to a detached garage apartment.Linksys' tech support was very helpful when I was trying to decide on this product. I highly suggest you call them."
1,Good Access Points...lousy PC Cards,"I have a linksys access point and it works very well with other cards like Orinoco, and Enterasys...but the Linksys PC cards are terrible. They have terrible performance (I've gone through 3 of them). The link quality drops off dramatically, even at short distances away from the access point. Save your money, buy the Orinoco instead."
3,"Well, it's working just fine for me","So, I'm writing this review from my living room. The Linksys wireless router is in my bedroom, and despite some considerable distance and walls, I've never had a problem with signal strength here in the apartment. I'm using the card on an HP laptop with Windows XP, so I had to download the updated Windows 2000 drivers from Linksys' site and ignore the ominous warning messages from Windows XP that the card wasn't XP certified. Once the drivers were installed, no worries and fine performance."
2,"Wait till version 2.5 comes out, or else just run some Cat5","I am real happy with my Linksys wireless Router (befw11s4), but I must say, this card has been a real disappointment.Within the same room (25ft by 25ft) the unit works flawlessly, but walk down the hall and by the time you turn the corner it is dead. And I am only talking about a 20 foot hallway. The manufacturers / editors claim of 150 meters indoors is crazy. With only a few wood walls in the way, I am unable to get this thing to go more than 30 feet.If you will be using this card within the same room as your router, then you will be fine. Perhaps it is okay for going one floor up or down in a wood structure. But don't expect much more than that.According to Linksys, there is a new wpc11v25 (version 2.5) coming out soon. It claims to have a more powerfull antenna. I would wait for that, or go ahead and just run some cat5 ethernet cable."
1,Range Poor,"There's been a lot of groaning about the range of this card, I concur. A couple walls, and it's out of range around 30 ft. I like the Linksys Wireless Cable /DSL Router. Had it up and running in minutes. But then again I already had a home network setup - I'm just upgrading it. The Linksys doc and software does have a certain unfinished quality about it that I'd find unnerving if I didn't know what I was doing. Think I'll try the Orinoco card that others are raving about."
1,Don't buy this card,"I trust Linksys for all their products except this. I run Windows XP and was getting a Low signal less than 10 feet away. I got this so I can work upstairs but I would get intermittent signals and speeds less than 45kbps(if I was lucky). I returned it and got an Orinoco Gold instead, and it's GREAT, 1.5Mbps anywhere in the house."
1,HORRIBLE AVOID,"Pros: Does this do anything other cards don't?Cons: Uh, where to start. First of all this thing AIN'T WORKING. It hasn't been working for over a month and no amount of reinstalling of drivers etc will work. I'm an IT professional and I'm comfortable with networks, but this product is flawed. Secondly, when it was working the PERFORMANCE IS POOR. My machine was the nearest to the router in the office - less than 2 metres -- and I regularly got link quality dropping below 50%!!!. Also there were occasional hangs. The other machines got worse. This is particularly annoying when you consider what figures Linksys claim for this POS. In short, HORRIBLE software, HORRIBLE documentation, HORRIBLE support, POOR performance. Get the Netgear MA401 instead because Linksys don't deserve money for this flawed product."
4,"Two Good, One Bad","I really wish that I could yell accolades for this product. 2 out of 3 though does not make this possible for me. I bought two of these and a Wireless Router(Linksys) and had a client up and running in 15 minutes, awesome. I bought one for my house and didn't work and had to send it back. The support people were decent and were quick to give up and say it's the hardware. All in all the Linksys Wireless system is an awesome thing ONCE it is set up."
4,I moved my access point,"I was very unhappy with my wireless card too. I read some reviews and decided to move my Linksys wireless access point. I moved it as high as I could get it. I put it on top of my entertainment center. I had it in the basement close to where the phone came in to the house. I also sent an email to Linksys asking about changing the channel on the access point. It improved only a little. It's strange, but it worked. I can now go outside with my laptop. In the house I can go anywhere, even in the basement where the access point was and get 86% or better. I had to buy $20 of wire to move the access point. I can use this wire to connect directly to my network when moving big files from one computer to another while watching TV. So leave it a little longer then you need."
1,"Beware, wpc11 has only marginal support for winXP","after 20min on hold linksys told me that 1st card was defective, one week later got new one and was after 1 hour of struggle able to install under winxp. linksys webstie has basically zero info on using their products w/winxp and the wpc11 xp driver was written in Jan and not updated since.A friend had similar probs and had to get a 2nd card also. on my pc after 30 min or so using wireless card pc freezes and must be rebooted. no explanation..if i had it to do again i would have looked for a product with better win xp support. I regret this purchase, the functionality has not been worth the pain."
2,poor reception,"I bought this Linksys wireless card. It is advertised as ""over 300 ft. indoors"". However, I only got less than 10% signal strength 30ft. away from the access point (whic is linksys BEFW11S4), and there is a wall and a wooden door in between. This performance is totally unacceptable.I returned the linksys card and bought a Netgear instead. works much better.Unless you use your wireless PC card close to the base (w/o any wall or door in between), stay away from this card..."
1,Range is very poor,"Using this card with the Linksys wireless cable/DSL router and access point, the best I could manage in my house was 40-50 ft. from the access point, practically useless. I returned the card and got an Orinoco Silver card for $90. It has about twice the range communicating with the same access point, and I can now use my laptop anywhere in the house. No compatibility problems either (I have Win2000 on both machines).Buy the Orinoco!"
1,Cannot recommend this product,"I bought this product several months ago now and have only gotten it to work ONCE ! I have my house networked wirelessly using all Linksys products - routers and wireless PCMCIA cards, with cable modem and a network HP laserjet printer. However, whereas everything else works fine, my laptop network card hasn't worked. I am totally frustrated with it and considering getting another card - maybe Netgear, which certainly has much better reviews than Linksys. My single concern is if this card will work with the Linksys wireless router.Anyways, I do not recommend the Linksys Network PC Card v.3 product since it has proven to be quite unreliable to me and many others as reviewed here."
2,Pain with Win XP (home),"For some reason, the version 4 of this card never worked with my Win XP home edition. The driver Linksys provided would cause my laptop to, at best, to stall and crash at other times. I just could not get it to work. My room-mate also had one (Win XP Pro). The driver didn't cause any problem on his system but he had other problems. For one the card would not find or connect to the access point if it's right next to it!! I would strongly suggest products of other brands as opposed to Linksys (I had a linksys access point which I got rid off!!)"
2,Avoid unless you buy only Linksys,"I already had a Cisco 350 card and was familiar with its setup. I also already had a Toshiba PCX5000 cable modem.The Linksys router will not work properly in a mixed setting, that is, if you mix brands of routers and cards. WEP becomes almost impossible and the internet gets dropped very easily even though you have a good quality signal. The card's client controller oftencannot adjust to the settings you assign to a profile and this issimply frustrating when compared with how much easier set up is with other routers.When you use Linksys products exclusively things work out better,things are even better when you use only wired connections or only one wireless card."
1,not good,"I owned the WPC11 wireless card with BEFW11S4 EtherFast Wireless-B Access Point and I don't know where to begin! After having myself and co-workers waste a total of 16 damn hours trying to figure this thing out, I returned it to the store. We all work in IT so it shouldn't be that hard right? Well, Linksys Reps were no help, claimed they didn't know why it didn't work, and sounded like the just learned what a computer was three months ago. I've given up on wireless until someone can guarantee that it will work with XP and the setup is under 10 minutes. I'm giving it one star because i have to."
5,802.11 rocks!,wirless rules the world! the linksys stuff is awesome. i was up and running in 10 minutes!
3,easy to set up and use but it stopped working after 6 months,"i bought this and was happy w/ it for six months. then it totally stopped working.. the laptop cannot recognize it anymore.. linksys has pretty good support. just tell them and the cross ship one to you in a few days.conclusion-- decent card.. but w/ the short range and other problems.. i will much prefer getting the orinoco ones, which is only a little bit more expensive. but if you don't mind the short range stuff.. then sticking w/ this is fine since they have pretty responsive tech support. i did not called.. email seems to be a pretty quick communication tool for me:)"
