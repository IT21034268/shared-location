1,CD not included in Kindle Version,I am very disappointed in the product. The description is suppost to include the CD but it is not included in the Kindle Version - even though the price is the same. I had to ask for a refund.
2,Less Than I Expected...,"I bought this book primarily for the CD-based regression session. I was quite disappointed. The entire CD consists of one track that lasts just short of 22 minutes.During the session, Dr.Weiss used only the most lightweight hypnotic induction techniques on this CD and had a tendency to rush through them. So, the depth of focus is not really adequate for deep recall.Furthermore, Dr.Weiss spent almost no time at all exploring the other-life setting: ""Find another life, look at your shoes, look at your clothes, do you remember dying? -- okay, time to wake up.""The whole 22-minute session felt more like a group demonstration during a public lecture on reincarnation. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"I have read several of Dr. Weiss' books, which I found highly enlightening and inspiring. However, this CD was not nearly on the same level.My main complaint is that it was too short. I don't see how Dr. Weiss can expect anyone to have an in-depth experience when the CD does not put you into a trance long enough for any real results to happen. What I have had to do is create my own CD that allows more time. I could have done that from the beginning and not spent any money.Otherwise, it was a soothing CD that did relax me. If you are looking for a real regression experience, this is not the one. As someone else said, you would probably be better off seeing a therapist in person for a real session."
2,Save Your Money for a Real Session,"I've read all of Dr. Weiss' books. This CD lacks the depth that the books seem to lack. Past Life Regression requires a professional to assist the client/patient with containment. My hat is off to those who choose to share the skills it takes to send us on the journey to healing. I would recommend Michael Newton PhD. He doesn't state 10 times in his books that he has a Phd, nor does he come across as pompous and he understands that trancework requires both the patient and the client to participate in communicating with guides. Be there, know that!"
2,Horribly biased.,"In a time of increasing political partisanship, it has become wearyingly familiar to see books that take a strong political viewpoint one way or the other. But usually, from the cover blurb alone, you know what you are getting.This book is too arrogant to admit such bias, and that is its downfall. It holds ludicrously strong opinions on the sainthood of Sean O'Keefe and the devilry of Dan Goldin, the last two NASA Administrators, while promoting itself as balanced and fair. Normally, such opinionated authors at least admit their biases, but this book is too self-important to do so.It's now also a pretty irrelevant book, with the departure of O'Keefe following the bureaucratic errors which this book ignores.Don't bother with it."
2,Propaganda pretending to be a book.,"What could have been a fascinating insight into White House politics on the space program is marred by the vehement one-sidedness of the authors' point of view. I wouldn't mind if the author had admitted this - but this book advertises itself as a true behind-the-scenes account. Instead, it puffs up the story when it suits the authors, omits crucial details that don't suit the politics of the authors, and demonizes those who hold opposing viewpoints. It's a wasted opportunity and a sadly shallow book compared to what it could have been. I am surprised that Apogee Books, who have an excellent reputation in the field, chose to take on this poisoned chalice."
3,There are better books on this subject than this one.,"I find this book to stand in stark contrast to excellent accounts elsewhere - most notably the new epilogue in the paperback edition of Walter Cunningham's ""The All-American Boys."" Cunningham manages to state in 29 pages a compelling case of the good and bad points of NASA's reaction to the Columbia disaster, something which these two authors fail to do over an entire book. Cunningham is as politically partisan as they come, and yet his account of NASA's inner workings is far more fair, detailed and objectively critical than this extremely blinkered book. I'd recommend saving your money and not buying this book - or, better still, buy a better book, such as Cunningham's."
1,I'm disappointed in the publisher...,"I bought this book primarily because the publisher has in the past printed excellent-quality, informative books on space history, and I was expecting the same here.Instead, I bought a badly-edited, mean-spirited rant about space politics. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, but don't waste your money on paying for the ones in this book, especially as they are dishonest. The book claims to be an objective look at recent NASA policies, but is anything but. One administrator is portrayed as the devil himself, another as a knight on white charger, with no effort to truly make any objective analysis. A missed opportunity, and a misstep by an otherwise great publisher."
1,Bad decision by Apogee Books.,"The publisher of this book are known for their high quality, very reliably informative space books.Keith Cowing is known for his highly opinionated and only occasionally accurate web blogs.In my opinion, Cowing is better suited for the web, where opinions can be debated, discussed - or ignored. By putting some of his rather extreme and one-sided thoughts into print, they've made highly disputed opinion look like fact. And that, I feel, cheapens their entire publishing line.Still, the book is now completely out of date, so a quiet deletion from their publishing catalog will probably happen soon anyway - we can hope."
1,"Hated it for a baby, love it for an 11 mo old","When we got this thing my daughter was 5 mo old, you can start using it at 4 mo it says. She could not even sit in it until she was 9 mo!! She was sitting alone at 6 mo but would fall to the sides in this thing until she was crawling! Now she loves it but BOY is it noisy.....I would NOT recomend this! Get one of the other brands that has the tray around it!"
1,"Scary, not safe","My 9 month old had fun at first. The single suspension rope (not shown in picture) twists with every turn he makes, like a corkscrew. Then, as soon as he lifted his feet off the floor he went spinning. If I wasn't right in front of him his head would of hit the doorway! It needs to be designed better so that the twisting won't happen. Needless to say, in the trash it went.Lili (mum of two)"
2,Needs adjustable sides,"My daughter is almost 5 months old, and although she doesnt mind sitting in this thing, I have to prep it before I put her in it.. Actually she's in it right now and she's having a blast, but i had to roll up some receiving blankets and stuff on the sides because the seat is really large.. MY son who is 2years old and weighs 32lbs can sit in it just right.. I think this thing should have some adjustable sides but other than that, my daughter truly is having a blast in it.."
1,Not very good,"I thought there would more content. The same film clips (2-4) were used over and over. With all of the films she made and pics that were taken over the years she was active, and this is all they could use??"
1,Poor Quality Item,"I overnighted this product for a gift. The item came on time, however, the color was messed up across the entire decal. There were patches of white where the purple should have been. There was also a 1 inch cut across the decal. Totally sticks out like a sore thumb. I am NOT giving this as a gift looking like this. I'd be cautious ordering this in fear of getting the same thing I did! I have pictures too! Good Luck with your $13. There is also no contact seller link."
4,it's a little short (just 10 songs)but it's good,I especially dug the last two tracks but this is a great compilation if yer short on da dime~then dis compilation won't waste yer time:-) listen to da twin guitar attack and you'll b. fine.
5,Classic,"14 years later this is one of my all time FAVES!!! I have bought it at least 4 times, keeps getting lost or stolen!"
5,The Bass Master at some of his best.,"Hearing so many great things about Jaco Pastorius I thought I'd start with his bass playing days with one of Jazz's great groups, Weather Report.This disc shows why the late-great Pastorius is considered by many as one of the best players to ever live.His style changed the way bass was played. Listening to these tracks you'll hear for yourself.The disc ranges from his studio performances along with some live performances with the band.The man could play. It's unbelievable. Pick it up."
3,A Few Songs Sound Dull,"""The Jaco Years"" were the peak years for the jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report. The band headed by Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter had used Miroslav Vitous and Alphonso Johnson on bass before hiring Jaco. I like the older albums but the ones with Jaco are my favorites and I seen them 4 times with Jaco and once with Alphonso. He made it three jazz giants in one super group, that all jazz fusion bands aspire to top: It will never be done. The live version of ""A Remark You Made"" is just incredible with the sax of Wayne and the bass of Jaco. The mixes of the next couple of tunes are kind of dull and are no where near as good on the other ""This is Jazz"" collection. The sound is better on the rest of the CD. All in All it's an OK collection but I wouldn't recommend it unless you just want to check out Jaco's sound with Weather Report. 3 stars."
5,"Jubilant, you are amazing!","Jubilant seizes to amaze me! I remember when I first hearing him sing at the Harvest Crusades; wow, I was absolutely in awe! Incredible. I immediately went out and got his self titled CD and absolutely adore it. As soon as I heard that this CD was released I literally raced to the music store. Anyhow, this CD is absolutely amazing. I'm not gonna try to describe his style and timbre, just so much to say, go out and experience it yourself (!). The man is genius. I particularly love how versatile his voice is. From a thunderous-knock you-off-your-feet blast, to a soft airy gentle sound. My favorites on this CD are john the revelator, have a little faith in me, ring dem bells. Oh, and my personal all time favorite is on his first CD, ""Were you there."" Makes my house tremble when he starts singing lower and lower, hehehe. Well, I'm done ranting :-)"
5,Amazing Voice,"Hi Jubilant... Man, you've come a long way from Santa Monica High School! Damn, though, you've still got that amazing voice! In my mind, though, you'll always be that 16 year old kid with the sound of an angel. Keep up the great work! Best wishes, Jeff (Bell) Zekas."
4,Great for the money.,I replaced a $20 kodak tripod with the bogen 3011bn a world of difference between the two! I needed a tripod that was tall being 6ft 3in I didnt want to bend down anymore to look through the viewfinder. If you are tall this is the tripod for you. It is reasonably light and sturdy and will go very low to the ground if needed especially with the low mount adapter. The legs have wingnuts which makes adjusting quick. I have the 322RC2 joystick head and carrying strap so I find myself using a tripod more because its easy to carry and use. I can see using this for more than a couple of years until I want something lighter. You can have the best lens and camera in the world but if you dont have a stable platform your shot will not be sharp.
5,A WOMAN CALLED GOLDA ( 10 OUT OF 10 0,"WE are christianzionists & we love anything to do with ISRAEL. SHALOM , GOD BLESS YOU ALL , REMEMBER US IF YOU GET ANY MORE GOOD JEWISH DVD'S"
5,"Excellent Movie, Non-biased","A quality drama of a unique portion of 20th century history. Fairly accurate in historical detail in describing the struggles of the reborn state of Israel. Despite all contrary odds and the concerted effort of four arab nations to annihilate the state of Israel, this young struggling nation under Golda's leadership not only survives but ""blooms"" in the desert."
4,A woman called Golda,"I bought this movie to complete a research project. The movie correctly depicted Golda's life, but there is always more to a person's life than can be contained in a movie. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of Isreal."
3,Rating Golda Meir DVD .,"The Golda Meir dvd, which I gave for a Chrismas present to a friend, was excellent. My friend has enjoyed watching the film!! I saw it on television when it initially aired, and know that the movie is well done!! I also purchased a used movie of Golda for myself; I believed it to be a used dvd. Unfortunately, I was sent a used videotape which I cannot play."
1,SENT WRONG BOOK,"The Wrong book was sent, the book cover totally different. They must not use their eyes while they packed the order."
1,The Downside of the First Amendment...,"...is that we have to put up with nutball ramblings like this. Mr. Kaminski is not only a holocaust denier but he believes that ""Jewish bankers"" caused 9/11 and that the Talmud is "" the heart of darkness"". He is now apparently on the run because his enemies are trying to poison him. He supports himself by begging."
1,Denies the Holocaust,"Those readers who are thinking of purchasing the books of John Kaminski might want to stop and consider the fact that he is a Holocaust-denier. I learned this from personal communication with the author. Does this make a difference? It does for me. In my view, he has zero credibility."
4,Real Good ~ Could be better,"I'm using the mouse right now. Susan is right about laptop touch-pads. I find them extremely annoying ... which is why I use an IBM ThinkPad. Along with my ThinkPad I use my ATEK mouse, sometimes on my right thigh while the laptop is on my left. Works fine ... with one exception: as Soumya pointed out, the responsiveness of the buttons has dropped off. That said, I'm ordering another one for my company issued laptop."
5,Back on track with a great cd!!! Must have for Gloria fans!,"Gloria, thank you for going back to what you do best -- dance, upbeat, latin flavored music! Gloria doing ballads is like a center bringing the ball down. They all want to be point guards!This is a great cd, one of her best! If you like her old latin beat music, get this for sure!!"
3,OK new album by Gloria Estefan.,"This album is not all that bad, I just think that her Greatest hits album, the 1992 album, is much better, because it contains more of the work that Gloria Estefan became very famous for, such as the song Conga."
1,"Disco, disco, more disco","Make no mistake (I did): this is a DISCO album, nothing more. For ""latin"" flavoring they added a timbale and Spanish lyrics. Repeat: this is a DISCO album. If you like disco, you'll love it. If you don't like disco, you'll HATE it."
5,GLORIA ROCKS,"Gloria Estefan definitely knows how to get you up on your feet and dancing! With her unique blend of disco and latin beats, the CD is a high voltage packed jam session from start to finish! Check out Cuba Libre; Gloria's heartfelt lyrics to a salsa beat regarding her birthplace. FANTASTIC CD. HER BEST YET."
1,This album is all DISCO. What a disappointment.,"I made the mistake of purchasing this album without knowing anything about it. Expecting it to be a continuation of her recent excellent works, I was extremely disappointed when I heard disco come through my speakers.I don't know what the last few tracks sound like, because I got disgusted after skipping through the first 8 or 10 tracks and turned it off.Some of the tracks even contain portions with rap. If an album contains rap, it should contain a warning sticker like ""not suitable for adults"" or ""you'll only like this if you have tattoos or have pierced several parts of your body""."
4,give it a chance,"Ok, the thing to keep in mind about this album is that it is in fact a DANCE album. I knew this when I bought it and aside from the three bonus tracks in Spanish, my first thought was ""I HATE this CD."" But I love Gloria. So I gave it a chance and it really does get better on subsequent listens. If you're more of an adult contemporary person then it is probably not for you. If you're a big Gloria fan and will buy pretty much anything she produces, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the dance beat throw you; this is a good, innovative CD that combines disco, dance and latin rhythms for a great sound."
2,Disappointment,"I wonder if she's the same lady who sang in Mi Tierra and Destiny.In my opinion, her diehard fans won't much appreciate this album."
5,Gloria Outdoes Herself Once Again,"Gloria Estefan has proven to be a outstanding singer with Miami Sound Machine. This latest edition, Gloria!, continues that awesome tradition. The best tracks in this awesome CD is Tracks 1(Heaven's What I Feel), 10 (I Just Wanna Be Happy) & 5/13(Feelin' & Feelin' Remix). The best of those 4 is I Just Wanna Be Happy. The beat is top notch and definitely toe tapping, whether on the road, at home or at work. Watch out in '99 for Gloria. Definitely some #1's in this collection."
2,mixed bag of styles leads to disappointment,"Gloria! is a mixed bag of styles - and those who loved her earlier hits and are not wild about hip-hop will probably be as disappointed as I am. There are several tunes which please, mostly in Spanish, which is giving me incentive to study up on my spanish vocabulary so I can understand what she's saying, but those hip-hop cuts are definitely irritating. Only some of this ""music is going to get ya""."
2,Missing the magic she had with miami sound machine!,"Her first solo album did ok but she went downhill from there. Fans of her newer music might disagree but if they took the time to hear her classic music in the 80's with Miami Sound Machine they would definitely hear the difference. On this ... cd, I liked 3 songs and the 4th song was a remake from one of those 3.They should have warning labels on these newer CD's that say music not intended for her original fans or this music is completely different from her 80's music."
3,good product,Back-board did not align with mounting bracket. Suggest assembling pre mounting to determine if the bracket mounting alignment should be adjusted.
5,excellent,"my husband's a long standing fan and loved this as a gift. There were even a few songs he'd never heard. The photo collection in the insert were great. As always, Dino never disappoints! Great Valentine gift for a fan."
4,"Dean Martin remastered ""The Nashville Sessions"" c.d. WHY NOT???","The c.d. titled: Amore (2009) has great remastered standards, not found usually on a greatest hits collection. However, instead of remastering old record catalogs with different photos of Dino, release the NEVER BEFORE ON C.D. ""THE NASHVILLE SESSIONS!!!"" from 1983.This was Dino's not only last country album, but his last album altogether!!! Where is the respect in that? There are some GREAT songs here that need to be remastered, starting with the classic ""Since, I met you Baby"" the hit song from the album. Plus his single ""I think I just wrote my first country song"" with guest.I LOVE this album, and it would sound great remastered, so if this could be made available, it would not only put alot of money in someones pocket, it would complete his discograhy!!!"
1,Static Central,"Consistent w/ the 1st person's review, both the video and sound are extremely staticy even despit attempting to use each of the 4 channels. The static was compounded when the TV was on, or if the phone rang and we were on it."
3,Not for Houses with Bad Cell Service,"I ended up having to return these. I bought them for my sister and her house has weird cell service, so I'm guessing that's maybe why they didn't work for her."
4,Some Doors Shouldn't Be Opened - But this one Should!,"Because of its miniscule budget, this modern-day ghost story relies more on its script and actors to deliver its shivers. And, on many levels, it succeeds at doing just that!The old Lyndora Hotel in Lyndora, PA, (an hour outside of Pittsburgh) creates a very creepy and atmospheric setting. The script (by Jackie Druga) is solidly plotted; and, for the most part, the actors turn in credible performances (most notably, Norm Wash as ""Father Mulligan"" and Katrina Rogers as ""Katie"").It's not a perfect film (the pace slows down a bit too much in a couple spots); but overall, it holds your interest, and is a nice change of pace from the blood-soaked/psycho killer dreck of modern horror films.If you're looking to curl up around the campfire (or TV, in this case) with a good old-fashioned ghost story, you can't go wrong by opening up ""19 Doors!"""
2,Poor story with poor acting,"I was a bit desperate for something to watch and after reading the first review I didn't listen to that voice in my head telling me there is no way it's worth the $2.99 to stream it. The acting is bad, which doesn't really bother me, but the writer tries to put every haunting cliché it can into the film without rhyme or reason. There is no logic to the story as it unfolds and the end is very disappointing. It resembled a bad student film. If this had been for free I still would have been disappointed."
5,from the back cover,"""It's over."" Sixteen-year-old Kristen Jameson's dream of becoming an Olympic medalist vanishes when she injures her leg in the final event of the Cascade District Meet. Gymnastics was her life-- now where can she turn?""Breathe deep. Forget the pain.""Overwhelmed by feelings of failure, Kristen plunges headlong into a life of parties, drinking, and deception, leaving behind her family, friends, and faith. New friends offer her a way to forget the pain, but not without tragic consequences.Her new life threatens to shut out Tim, the one person who really cares about her. Are his feelings genuine? Can she trust him to help her? Can she trust God? Kristen has to choose."
5,Back to the Basics,"With Pop Music on it's death bed, mainly through the lethal injection of rap music on our culture, it's relieving to hear a band that can not only play an instrument (well) but also create a tune that stays with and is uplifting too! I hear a lot of 60's influence (John Sebastian on Half a Smile, Kinks on Trixie) but is that a bad thing? After all, that was the golden age of pop music, a time when you had to have talent to get recorded."
4,Just Buy It,"This is the album of the year that won't win album of the year. Yes there are the obvious influences (Beatles, Kinks, Beach Boys.....is that really such a bad thing???) there are shades of current bands like The Merrymakers, Jellyfish, Myracle Brah and (another Brad Jones produced band) The Shazam. In a musical world full of either kiddie pop or dysfunction-on-my-sleeve MTV fodder this is real music.....thank you SWAG."
4,Good googly moogly!,"Are you tired of generic boy-band pop? Have you had all you can stand of depressing, e-minor rock? If so, throw this CD into your cart.The uplifting pop-rockers and McCartney-ish ballads will have you singing along in no time. Swag may be a side project, but I hope they will make a few more albums, because the world needs more good music like this."
4,The 60's live!,"I heard cuts from this album on National Public Radio and had to have it! If I hadn't known better, I'd have thought the album was cut by a great garage band in 1967. Since I love the music of 1967, I'm happy. Don't look for innovation here, just kick back and enjoy the experience."
2,Background music,"I had high expectations for this band when I first heard ""Near Perfect Smile"" on NPR.After a more in-depth look I was really let down and also $14 down.I can only describe this album as music I would find myself tapping my foot too at work if I wasn't paying attention; it's just to simple with no distinguishable breaks or identities.It's an album full of la la la tracks that blend together like lukewarm spaghetti-o's."
2,"Really want to like this one, but...","On the surface, it sounds a helluva lot like producer Brad Jones' solo classic ""Gilt-Flake,"" which on my subjective rating scale merits about a six (out of a possible five). So that, and the participation of the oft-inspired Doug Powell, made this one a no-brainer.But the Swag material is not nearly as clever and seductive as Brad's stuff (or even Doug's). Just as The Grays were an amazing amalgamation of off-the-charts talent, you can hear frayed bits and pieces of each band member's attempt at leaving his signature, but those looking for a reason to smile might just lose patience by the 11th or 12th track.Gonna put this one back in the shelf and revisit some time in the future. After several listenings, it just ain't sticking..."
3,Not exactly breaking new ground.....,"I lost interest in this album extremely quickly. As stated, this band is not exactly breaking new ground and it took on a ""been there, heard that"" feel for me. Don't get me wrong, sometimes retro can be fun - but it certainly wasn't here. The band has a lot of potential and a nice sound, but their material was lacking....."
3,The new Beatles,"This CD is not remiscent of the Beatles. For all intents & purposes, this is the Beatles. If you enjoy their latter day, mainly slower material (such as on ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Pepper's""), then by all means check out this album. I expected more of an alt-country feel considering the band features members of other bands (Wilco, for example), but this is pretty much straight forward Beatlesque jangle. The CD is quite good, but I give it a 3 because of the lack of originality (being that it sounds exactly like another band)."
1,Time Warped,"This is power-pop... from Nashville! The playing and singing shows great technical ability. It's not substantial music, but it's very pleasant and listenable. Most of the cuts echo sounds of the past from the Beatles to Cheap Trick to the Kinks. Not bad for a debut. Now let's see if they can follow it up with something that sounds like they mean it. I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go."
1,Predictions of the future didn't include misrecorded DVDs,"Don't waste your money on this DUD! Reel Classics completely screwed up this classic by transcribing it to wide screen aspect ratio (16:9), it should be regular old 4:3. The result is that all of the characters look FAT, particularly their faces and legs. I tried to correct this on four different DVD players, to no avail. They have turned a true Sci-Fi classic into a visual comedy. Is this what we are in store for with the transition to HD?? How many years will it take the DVD industry to get this stuff right? Does Amazon check for these obvious flaws in the products they sell?"
3,Critique,"After 2 or 3 tries, I usually get the distance to the flag. However, it often picks up larger items behind the flagstick. I like the fact that I can measure to other items other than the flag (such as bunkers and water hazards.)"
3,Great idea but not effective -- too difficult to hold steady,"I bought the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour Laser Rangefinder despite warnings about the inability to hold it steady enough. I have no tremor; neither do I have any problems with steadiness; however, I found it practically impossible to hold the laser crosshairs on the flagstick from 60-100 yards away without getting a multitude of readings, depending upon what reflection it relied upon. I found myself with a multiple choice reading, and even the one closest to my estimate was doubtful. Even steadying the binoculars on the cart edge didn't really help much.I'd really love to find something that was quick, easy to use, and reliable. My short iron and wedge shots are my most reliable means to birdie and par!"
3,Good line of sight rangefinder,"I used this rangefinder for one season of playing golf. It is well constructed and operates as claimed. The only drawback is that you have to be able to actually see the flag to be able to get a reading. The other problem I encountered was if there is something behind the flag like a tree this product has a hard time telling the difference between the two. I understand that they (Bushnell) have newer models that do not have this problem. I later purchaced a GPS unit that I like a whole lot more as it gives you much more information than just distance. This is a good product, but I think it is obsolete in light of all the amazing GPS units out there now, some which can even be applied to your smart phone."
4,Must have a steady hand!,"I have found results up to 150 yards to be ok for hand holding. Past 150 you need to rest the Rangefinder on either a cart, Push cart, or even a tree. A monopod would also solve this problem. It does as advertised and has made a huge difference in my approach shots. You will quickly find some markers at your local course could be off as much as 20 yards. Pine trees work out to be the easiest to get a reading from though still difficult past 300 yards. After much research this is the best for the buck. Would highly recommend."
2,Rangefinder dissappointing,"I expected that the rangefinder would consistently give me a correct distance to the flag. Instead it often gives two or three different readings varying as much as one hundred yards. By using my common sense I can eliminate the 234 yard reading and settle on the 94 yard reading if I know I am around 100 yards out. Friends with the laser rangefinders that reflect off the flags that are so equipped, and friends with older model Bushnell rangefinders do not seem to have this problem. I tried to return this product but was told I could not because I did not have the original packaging. Conclusion: disappointing product and unacceptable return policy."
1,By far the worst movie ever made,"There is nothing cute about this low budget foolish movie. The script and acting are horrible. The story is disjointed and choppy. The best thing about the movie are the few beautiful scenes of Greece that are used over and over. It really is not a kids move as there are a number of scenes with very adult situations. There is a theme of seduction throughout the movie, which was inappropriate for children. Save yourself and hour and a half and skip Fish Tales."
4,Fish Tales,"This movie had potential. It falls in the ""family film"" catagory and worth a watch with your kids if you have any between the age of 5-12.The casting was good, but the actors could have used a better script. The price was right and I gave it a shot and didn't regret watching it. It' a family film."
1,Did a monkey or a 3 year old write this script???,"this movie had no identifiable plot, no character development, and jokes that werent. there were several random scenes that made no sense and had no impact on the plot at all. the best part of the whole movie was when the old lady farted. in fact, that was the ONLY good part. this is a perfect example of how not to write a movie. Did anyone with a functioning brain watch this movie before it was released? if so they might need to rethink the whole ""functioning"" brain thing. i strongly suggest not watching this movie. i want my 3.99$ back!"
1,"Cheap indie horror flick. A total cliche, predictable.","Contains spoilers...Easily one of the worst indie movies I have seen. Totally predictable cliche of a shaky-cam horror flick.Such a totally predictable film, within the first ten minutes I could tell you which characters would be the last ones to die, the most annoying ones.The bald guy and the young girl with the camera being the most obnoxious characters are of course being some of the last to die. I found myself rooting for the monsters to kill them earlier on.The young girl with the camera of course is capable of so many things, except not talking. The rude bald guy was totally about himself at the expense of the rest of humanity is also nearly a survivor.The camera always seems to briefly fail sparing the film crew from having to spend money on special effects, except at the end of the film when a stage hand holds up a tiny plastic tyrannosaurus in front of the camera calling it an effect!Do yourself a favor, skip this one."
3,decent found footage style b-movie,"I'd wait till the price drops, but if you like SyFy movies or the current slew of low-budget cloverfield/paranormal activity, you will probably be relatively entertained by this. The interpersonal conflict/whining dragged a little long, but overall I enjoyed it."
3,"Not bad, nor great.","I think the only issue that I have with this movie is that the characters are some of the most suplid ones I have ever seen, speaking and saying nothing but bulls*** and acting as pussies.Other than that the film is pretty intense with good special effects and a twist ending that is trully remarkably frightening.Still, I sugest you better check this one out in Netflix, and if you end up liking it, then buy this disc."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking forward to watching this when I heard about it. Unfortunately, it sucked. Alot. Complete waste of money, I should have saved myself $7 and watched Jurassic Park instead."
4,Entertaining.,"While the premise was a bit weird, I can say that the acting was done really well, especially by Samantha Lester, and James & Melanie Lyons. I do wish Samantha Lester had gotten more screen time though, she's gorgeous! She was definitely the best in the film.The film will keep you entertained till the end, and what an end it was!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring; knock your socks off boring","This books is SO BORING, it's not a surprise that it has fallen out of print. This book was so bad, reading it made my feet fall asleep. I'm sure we can forgive the author, but not the expense of buying a copy of this pathetic refuse. It didn't even make good compost. If you want to read something that is absolutely, astonishingly, perfectly bad, search out a used copy of this book."
5,Medieval Enchantment,"Incredible voices and vocal interaction. The lack of an instrument is an asset in this type of music and these people are masters of voice. Great composition and feeling as well. This is gift, I, of course have one for myself!"
3,Works pretty good,I did not have any problems with leaking or puddling of water. This unit held its charge during the whole time I mopped my large kitchen floor. I agree with the previous reviewer who thought that the bristles should be lowered just a bit. It did take quite a few passes to clean up foot tracks etc. Overall the mop worked fine. Not sure if i will be keeping this yet. I do think it is faster to get out the old fashioned mop.
2,"big name, lousy performance",The mop is not as good as it is hyped to be. The suction is not efficient. It leaves the floor wet. It does not remove stains very well.
3,Pay the extra and get a steam mop,"I bought this for my linolium and hardwood floors. As the 3 stars indicate - its okay. It kinda works, but doesn't do deep cleaning. I've decided to upgrade to a steam mop, which does a much better job cleaning and disinfecting."
3,Cordless Electric Mop,Pros:Appears to clean wellCordlessCons:Short battery lifeTakes 2-3 times longer to clean/dry floor vs using swiffer wetjetLoud
5,LOVE This Cleaner,"This is a great cleaner, I love how it sucks up the dirty water. I do not mind having to refill the cup a few times. I found it to work very well on wood, tile and ceramic. The grout cleaner works really great on cermaic tiles. Highly recommend this product. I did find it $20 cheaper at my local Hoover dealer."
4,Works good so far,"Its a little bulky. It seems to work really well, it puts out more water than I would have expected, would not use on wood floors. But it does pick up very good."
1,disapointment,I was sooo excited to get this product because I had read the GREAT reviews... however I must have purchased the dud! This mop doesnt seem to scrub at all. I even leave it over dirty spots on my floor for several minutes making sure that it scrubs and when I take the mop off it's still dirty! It doesnt seem to scrub or clean anything! The vacuum on it works wonderful! However I didnt want to spend that kind of money on a mop that just vacuums up water. Oh well..
1,Don't waste your money,"Mine broke after 5-6 uses. Company replaced it quickly, but replacement broke after 3 uses in exactly the same place."
1,No very good mop,"I have been very dissapointed in the performance of this mop. I initially charged te mop for around 24 hours before using it for the first time. Manufacturer recommends scrubbing an area around 3x2 feet,then vacume up the water, then go on to the next area, which is what I did. They claim a charge should last around 35 minutes. Mine lasted around 10 before the battery gave up the ghost. I plugged it back in for another 24 hours (it actually took that long to re-charge), then tried again. This time it died after 13 minutes. The vacume part also doesn't work very well--only gets about 10% of the water it puts on the floor. Only was able to finish about 1/2 of my kitchen. I'm not impressed with this mop and really can't recommend it to anybody"
3,It's good for small areas,I realized when I purchased this product it wasn't for big jobs. I do enjoy this product to just keep my floor cleaner between regular mopping jobs. But understand it's just for small jobs and not very strong.
3,I like it but it has a flaw,"I really like this product. It does exactly what I want it to do. However, the brush isn't as nice as the brushes on the bigger models and the soap tank leaks. I just squeeze the trigger and dispense the amount of soap that I want and then release the tank so it stops flowing until I want to dispense some more. Overall it does the job."
4,"good product, bad shipping","I like the product, the only drawback is that it does not hold a charge as long as I need to do all of my floors - I have a large older home with hardwood floors throughout. I do the 1st floor, recharge and then do the 2nd floor the following day. I ordered the product on Dec. 10th for xmas but it did not arrive so a new one was shipped Dec 26th."
1,Hoover H2510 Implus crordless electric power mop,"I purchased this Hoover Inplus cordless mop, and I was disappointed that the charge didn't last long. and the water I applied did not pull back into the machine as I expected it would,leaving the floor very wet.A more expensive one might have done better, I've been back using the ole string mop."
4,Before The Greatness...,"The contention of this wonderfully detailed book that chronicles the life of FDR from his birth in 1882 and concludes with his marriage to Eleanor in 1905 is that the makings of a great person can be found in his or her upbringing. A thorough analysis of both the Roosevelt and Delano families throughout the 1800's lends creedence to the fact that FDR was groomed to be great by both sides of the family. I finished this engrossing and well-written book in a few days, and I am enjoying immensely the second part of the saga, Ward's A FIRST CLASS TEMPERAMENT, which takes FDR's story from his marriage through to his reentry into politics in 1928."
1,salsa,"I ordered and paid for the product and never received it, very disappointed will never order from here again, and now you want me to order something I never received."
1,bought this for someone,"I dont like this music but I bought this for someone and they said it was terrible, and that person is a salsa fanatic.thats all."
4,Great Music,This CD brought back alot of memories. I love the music. I had the record way back int he day but between all the moves and everything it doesn't quite play plus I don't have a record player anymore.
2,Cold Salsa,"Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD. It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years. Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next. One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever. Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it. The rest of the CD is throw away. But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money. It's the only reason I gave this album two stars! If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store ""Pronto!""."
1,salsa movie with only one salsa song on it. poor at that.,"what kind of movie soundtrack is this? there is only one salsa song in it and still is very poorly done. the rest are music from the 50s and 60s, doo wop, rock and roll, hillbilly , country, what the heck. very disappointing. how can somebody title this movie ""salsa"" boggles my mind. this movie should be entitled ""smorgasbord"". don't buy this CD, it's a waste of money if you are looking for salsa or latin music. very deceiving."
5,best Cd,"It was great to finally find this CD for a good price, my mother loves it! she loved the movie too so when i was able to buy these for her she was exstatic."
2,Kind Of Disappointing...,"I purchased this CD thinking that I was going to have hours of fun listening to it the same way I enjoy watching the movie. Unfortunately, half the songs played in the movie are NOT featured on this CD. Even the song, 'Margarita' is a different version than the movie. In the movie, it is sung by Michael Sembello, but on the CD, Wilkins performs it. All the other songs, with the exception of Robbi Rosa's, 'Under My Skin' and 'Puerto Rico,' are old songs from the 60's, and were not made FOR this soundtrack, but were added since they were played in the movie. If that's the case, why not include the other songs we heard? Mucho Money....Salsa Heat...Canto Limon???? Great movie, but the soundtrack was poorly done."
5,One of the best,Having amassed a fairly large Jazz collection over the past few years I have to say that this reissue of Ah Um & Mingus Dynasty is easily one of the best collections you could buy. The playing and composition is outstanding and the best of Mingus' work easily stands its ground with Miles and Coltrane in their prime
3,For ultra casual fans only,"Futurama: Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection collects four episodes of the much loved sci-fi spoofing series from Simpsons creator Matt Groening. The episodes collected here include ""Hell Is Other Robots"", ""Anthology of Interest I"", ""Roswell That Ends Well"", and ""The Sting""; all of which are quite funny and great episodes as well, and the DVD itself includes some introductions from Groening and others as well. However, all that being said, this DVD compilation is for ultra casual fans of the series only who don't already own the DVD season box sets. For those that do own the DVD season box sets, there's absolutely no reason to buy this disc at all, but for ultra casual fans of the series or those new to the series and are looking to get into it, this is a decent buy. It's just disappointing that a few more extras weren't included on here, which would have been really nice."
2,mixed feelings,"this dvd is a scam by fox to screw money from the body of the show they killed. myself, i would much prefer the owners of the show to pay attention to the dvd sales of the boxes & recomission it. whilst these are excellent episodes & MAY have extras by matt groening himself, there is no reason to buy this if you own all four season boxsets - & if you don't own them, buy them, they're brilliant.that said the price is reasonable for U.S. consumers & for a collector it will complete the set."
3,great great show poor selection of episodes,"hell is other robots 3/5anthrology of interest 1 2/5roswell that ends well 4/5the sting 1/5 (one of the worst futurama episodes)here are how the disc should bespace pilot 3000 (help new viewers get acquainted with series)the problem with popplers (classic episode)anthrology of interest 2 (bender being human, video games and wizard of oz speaks for it self)less then hero (classic episode with the crew as crime fighters, the theme is very classic as well)if you need a brief introduction to the series this is the dvd to get but this dvd does not contain the best episodes futurama has"
5,Maybe the best WWII book,"I read ""Winterspelt"" in 1979 for the first time. Since that first time I read it again not once. I think it's a masterpiece, really a great novel, and the best one by Andersch. I would include it in the ""20th Century 20 Best Novels"" list of mine. By the way, I'm looking for any French translation of ""Winterspelt"" for a French-speaking friend of mine, who failed to find it in Paris. Any help on this matter to be appreciated."
1,The Little Toaster Oven That Can But Won't Anymore,"This is an update to my original review above. A few days before it's one year anniversary, the bottom heating element crapped out. By the time I was able to track down the receipt, the one year expired... by a couple of days. Initially, Sanyo would not replace or repair arguing that the warranty had expired. After much complaining up the chain of command, Sanyo did us ""a favor"" by sending a replacement (but not the same model toaster oven). The replacement, which we believe was a factory reconditioned model, is now 6 months old and being tossed out as the bottom heating element on this model has also crapped out. Spoke to Sanyo but they are refusing to repair or replace. Bottom line: Will not purchase Sanyo products. To pay that kind of money and not have the company stand behind their product is not worth it."
1,Worked well until it died,"I liked this toaster oven a lot, it made toast well, which is what I wanted. Then, after just over year, it just quit working. A repair place said the part (if they could even get it) would cost ~$100, so it's garbage now."
3,Okay,The oven and looks were nice but I didn't want a wobbly oven. The little black knobs on the bottom tend to wobble so I returned it.
1,Broke in less than 13 months,"We liked this toaster oven until the top heating element broke 13 months after we purchased it, making it basically useless. The Black 'n Decker I'd had previously was more than 12 years old and cost less than [...]."
1,Sanyo SK-VF7S toaster oven,"On the strength of Amazon reviews, I bought this contraption. It's turned out to be probably the worst appliance I've ever owned. Toast is unevenly toasted from the front of the unit to the back, and it's all dried out from the convection feature, I guess. Who needs air blowing across toast when it's toasting? And the oven! As you can see from the ad, you can't adjust it to just any ol' temp you want, like you can on any self-respecting oven. You're forced to use only the temps demented Sanyo engineers dictate, none of which I've never encountered in any recipe. The timer is screwy, too. After you set the time, the knob doesn't creep back down to zero like you'd expect. Instead, little lights indicate the countdown progress, but only in 5-minute increments. This thing is going out to the trash as soon as I can find a replacement."
5,Great toaster oven,"Toasts beautifully, whether bread, English muffins, sandwiches. Toast is ready in about 2 minutes, unlike my $100 Euro Pro, which took at least 10 minutes to toast something. This takes up less room, is better looking and I hope will last longer. It feels sturdy and well-made. The pan to use for reheating pizza or heating items works well and is easy to clean."
2,functional but lame toaster oven,"This toaster oven works, but I wouldn't buy it again:* Nasty shrill beeping sound when toast is ready* Uneven temperature distribution -- burns in some places not others* Very coarse temperature range, e.g., you can set the oven to 320 or 400, but nothing in betweenOur previous unit was the Panasonic NB-G100P, which I liked a lot better, although I was annoyed when the heater element failed after 2 years and turned out to be too difficult to replace."
3,It's been a year R.I.P. Sanyo,"I bought this oven in Jan of 2005 when it was on sale for 39.99. This oven is handsome, and it looks very nice on my kitchen counter top. Unfortunately, 1/2 a year later it started to make noise when being use over 3 minutes. (buzz...hm...m sound) That has limited me to use it for simple task like toasting sandwich bread and such.Well, yesterday (almost exactly 1 year later) it put my flat bread on fire so I decided to throw this little handsome oven away. Would have give it 5 stars if it lasts a couple years longer :)"
2,Long Term Problems,"My wife and I loved this appliance so much that we bought two more for my Mother-In-Law and our beach cottage. Two of the three are now in the trash. Unfortunately, I don't believe that the heating element is designed to stand up to regular use. It works really well, but only for 6-9 months before we found ourselves searching Amazon again for a more reliable toaster oven. Very disappointed!"
4,Just purchased my second one--,"After 2 years and 8 months of regular use, the top element has just burned out and I've ordered a new one. It's a very easy oven to use--great for defrosting and toasting bread or bagels and baking small dishes. I would have given it a 5 stars if it had made 3 years but I'm quite happy enough to get another one."
3,READ DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY,"This toaster oven works well and saves time and energy when I use it instead of my stove's oven and it bakes small items faster because of the convection feature. The toaster works well with a little experimenting with different kinds of bread.It is important to read the directions carefully. This oven gets very hot on the outside, so the 4"" away from other objects is necessary. Also, pre heat the oven before using. I put in a large roll to warm and it caught fire because the top element was too close and I had not pre-heated the oven. I have not had this happen when the oven was pre-heated. It takes about 5 min to pre heat."
5,big and small,We were looking for a good but small toaster oven. This one works great and is small enought to leave on the counter or store in a cabinet.
2,Upper Heating Element Stopped Working,"We bought this oven to replace our old toaster oven, and now about a year later the upper heating element has quit! It did toast and cook, so I have reluctantly given it two stars. However, it never heated or toasted in a manner I would expect from an oven in this price range. Our $20 toaster oven worked just as well. This oven required a lot of shifting of foods and guestimating on cooking times and temperatures, and in recent weeks it began to burn the top of food placed in the back left-hand corner. It is bulky, becomes extrememly hot, gives you little control over time and temperature and is unreliable. As a parent of two young children, this oven was used daily and it was obviously not up to the task. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Shame on Sanyo for selling an oven which obviously has a defect with the upper heating element."
2,Good for a Couple of Years,I have owned this oven for about 2 years. Until a month ago it worked pretty well whether toasting or baking - unfortunately the top heating element died. I hate to throw it out but I can't find anybody to repair it or even if it is possible to get a spare part. Too bad because I really liked it.
3,Almost a winner,"In regards to cooking and user friendly controls, the toaster oven is great. However I am disappointed with two things about it. The first and biggest disappointed is the apparent manufactures defect regarding the ovens door. The door falls off on the left (Looking at the toaster) side of the oven. There is a lot of ""wiggle room"" for the door and if you move it to the right just enough, the door pin falls out of the hinge. Granted, I could ""rig"" it to correct the problem but this is not a $20 toaster oven. The second issue which was more my fault is the size. For example, it will fit a personal pan pizza (For one person) max. It looks bigger in the picture then it really is. So make sure you note the measurements before you buy. I actually down graded in size and found out I couldnt cook everything I could before. The toaster cooked excellent but I cant recommend though due to the door hinge issue. If that weren't a problem, it would be a great compact toaster oven."
2,Didn't last,I bought this oven about a year ago and have been satisfied with it until a few things started happening. The lower element only gets gets hot on the one side. The upper element quartz glass broke and now doesn't work at all.There are only two of us in the household and the toaster oven was not over used or abused.I would not purchase this unless you do not mind buying a new toaster oven every year or so.
5,Excellent Product,Since receiving our Sanyo toaster oven we have enjoyed great results in all aspects of this product. Very well made and looks great on our counter. We recommend it very highly.. Richard & Teresa Hackett
4,Nice Sanyo,"I like this toaster oven. It is just the right size (small), has a lovely stainless finish, toasts very well, and does a fine job of baking. I love the convection oven! What I don't like is the limit of only 5 temperature choices and the timer dial. I didn't know about these limitations but probably would have ordered it even if I had known. It's certainly doing the job for me."
3,Can't set temps,"Its a nice little oven, but we're disappointed to see it only has a few preset temperatures for baking. Can't set 350 degrees, for example."
2,Great Toaster Oven-WHEN IT WORKS?,"Purchased this Toaster-oven based on the positive reviews and must admit that it is a good unit when it works, BUT, I have now returned 2 of these units! First unit had a very noisy fan that worked only occasionally, so I sent it back and waited for a MONTH until they sent me another unit. The second unit worked for about 15 minutes and then totally quit (would not come on). So I am off to ship it back to SANYO in CA. and hope that it doesn't take them a month to send another one. Take it for what its worth. Hope that 3rd time is a charm!"
3,Inside dimensions are smaller than you might expect,"I returned this toaster oven the day I received it. I was disappointed that the inside dimensions are not much bigger than smaller and cheaper toaster ovens. So if you are looking for a toaster oven that can handle an 11 inch frozen casserole, this is not the one. If this is a consideration for someone else, I thought you might like to know."
2,Disappointed,"I returned this item almost immediately. Unrelated to it's overall quality, it was not well packed and some of the styrofoam was broken when I opened the box. With the reviews about poor customer service, I didn't want to chance it.In terms of quality, it was very low for the price. I must have misread the description, because I was under the impression that the heat settings were variable. It only gives you five, very odd heat settings--like 320 degrees--I know of no/few recipes that uses this temp. Even my old Black and Decker had variable settings. Also, the interior size is about the same as my old Black and Decker, but the unit was a good 5-6 inches wider from the outside--it's pretty big for a small kitchen. The stainless steel finish looks chinzy. The fan was very loud."
5,Excellent bread toaster.,"Bought this for toasting bread because of good rating and best buy award and it has lived up to this claim. It's easy to use and faster than a regular toaster oven. Faster baking; therefore, must lower cooking time. I would recomend this item for those who want a fast, healthy baked meal."
3,Shock Value,"The toaster oven performs very well and indeed much better than all of our previous models that we generally replaced about every two years. Unfortunately, I must report something that I believe may be a design flaw. Shortly after we received ours, my daughter told me that it shocked her while taking something out. I promptly returned it and got another one and the new one shocked her as well. It did not shock me when I tried it, but I noticed she had no shoes on and that was the difference. Our home is on a slab with ceramic tile floors, but I really thought that today's appliances had safeguards against those kinds of problems. I have tried to find Sanyo's website or some way to report this, but Sanyo seems to be so spread out that getting to the proper dept gives me a severe headache. Perhaps they will see this review and investigate this.So how many stars should I give it? I put 3, but I would give if 0 if you are barefoot and do not like being shocked."
2,Doesn't last very long...,We purchased this 1 year and 1 week ago. Love the functionality and got used to the look. It gets used every single day. We bought this more expensive oven since we thought it would last a long time. The top element burned out 1 week after the warranty ran out!!! I am not very happy about having to buy another oven. I'm sure I won't be able to convince my wife to buy another one like this. Next time I read reviews I'll make sure to check if the item has some longevity.
3,"Good Oven, Poor Toaster","We've had this product for more than a year, but we're replacing it because the toast it makes is much too dry and hard."
1,Not what I imagined,"This product has one shelf which just does not work for me at all. I had a EuroPro oven that pooped out after 5 yrs. & went w/ this because I'd had Sanyo products before but this one is small inside, only has one shelf. I need 2-3 shelves. Over the weekend I found another EuroPro for a great price at WalMart & it has 3 shelves & is more straight forward to use. I returned this Sanyo."
2,Can withstand a fire and still work,"This toaster oven has been put through the ringer and it still works great. I've had it less than a year and I'm still very happy with my purchase. The metal looks a little worse for wear, but other than that..."
1,fire!,It was terrible! everything we put in it either burnt of set on fire even if the rest of the food didn't cook!stay away!
1,Buyer Beware,"This product sounded great.Unfortunately,it arrived with a broken door.The hinge on one side was defective,& the door wouldn't close properly-something that should have been apparent if the oven had ever been inspected."
5,Brilliant Oven,Quick delivery. Excellent Oven. People at the office love it. So easy to user and toasts in no time. Highly recommended.
1,Do not purchase this toaster oven!,"Purchased this toaster oven back in Jan. of 09'. Worked great until now. The heating element went out on one side and is heating and toasting unevenly. Now after a little over a year, I have to throw it away and purchase another toaster oven!"
1,FAILED AFTER 15 MONTHS,"The performance of this oven was just OK and it's not a cheap oven. Then, after 15 months, a part of the top heating coil just stopped heating so you can only toast on the left side of the oven. I've had cheap ovens last much longer. As pointed out by other reviewers, it's just too expensive to repair one of these units out of warranty, so it's just pretty much junk."
5,Satisfied my very picky wife!,"I don't believe in long reviews, but here goes. My wife is one of the pickiest women I've ever seen. She examines all the clothes she buys down to the stitches and has an eye for quality. Maybe it stems from her being from another country, I don't know. But, we have tried 3 different 'box store' toaster ovens and she couldn't stand them. She LOVES this one, and to think I surprised her with it and she didn't get to approve it first! Cooks salmon really well and in 20-25 minutes on 475. Money well spent!"
2,Worked great until top element stopped working,"We used this quite regularly and with good success for about 3.5 years. Suddenly, the top element stopped working. Reading the other reviews on Amazon, I see this is not an isolated problem with my oven, but a systemic problem with the product. It seems the element is not built well enough to be used much more than 2-3 years. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a toaster oven."
5,Very Pleased,"This is just what I wanted. It makes great toast(4 slices at a time) and the oven is great if you have kids that like heating up chicken strips, or other items that get soggy in a microwave."
2,For the price should be better,This is my second sanyo toaster oven. This has lasted about two years. Toasts bread very uneven...sometime you have to flip the bread over half way through the toasting cycle..not a fun thing to do in a toaster oven..Maybe it is just bad luck but for $90 should last more than 2 years.Would not but this toaster oven again.
4,Excellent little oven,The Sanyo is a vey attactive and compact toaster oven. It toasts quickly and evenly (if the toast is flipped mid-way through toasting). We love its small size and convenient operation. We gave it four rather than five stars because of its timer's limitation of only 40 minutes maximum (90 minutes would be ideal) and the limitation of only being able to select one of five pre-programmed temperature settings.
1,devil machine,"DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER. I've had this toaster and I can't believe I'm so lazy that I haven't bought a new toaster. toasts unevenly, is excessively loud, and WORST of all the tray on this toaster/oven is terrible. its constantly coming loose and laying on the heating elements. its difficult to get food out without it falling into the crumb tray. About once a week I consider pulling it out the wall, throwing it into my front yard and stomping on it office space style. I never write review, but I really hate this thing."
4,Kitchen Convenience,"When my 8 year old countertop convection oven died I discovered that the same brand was no longer manufactured. After checking other brands I found the Sanyo oven. I am very pleased with the new one as I use it every day. I have baked biscuits, salmon steaks, potatoes and it makes wonderful toast. I also heat my English muffins and they are perfect. I would highly recommend this appliance. Yes, I found the temp settings to be weird but am now used to them."
4,Sanyo SK-VF7S Digital Convection Oven,"Product works very well. Don't like the set oven temperatures range (320-400, etc). Easy to clean and a decent size without overwhelming my countertop."
2,Great if you like getting shocked,"The toaster oven works well with one big down side, it shocks you. My wife was shocked twice while putting the cooking pan in it. I also notice that the plug is not the three prong ground type so shocks are not a big surprise."
1,Dissapointed,"After reading some positive reviews regarding the Sanyo Stainless-Steel Digital Convection Oven I decide to purchase it. Toasting is uneven, one side burns, the other under-toasts. I feel like I wasted my money and will not recommend this toaster over."
1,Damaged,The oven came missing a control knob. When turned on it made a noise like the fan was hitting something. I returned the oven.
4,Sanyo Convection Oven review,"This Sanyo oven has been a welcome addition to our family after deciding not to microwave anymore. We felt lost at first without the micro but have come to like the convection oven more. It makes delicious toasty sandwiches, reheats leftovers and can even bake a one layer cake. Very easy to clean. Doesn't take up a lot of counter space.Down side, you can't reheat that cup of coffee in the morning; but we've adapted."
4,Great stainless look,"I really like this oven. I use it mainly to toast and heat up things. The toast part is pretty good, I haven't had burnt toast or under toasted bread yet. Big enough for a personal size pizza and it baked the Pillsbury rolls fine. Sturdy construction too, not light and flimsy feeling."
1,Why is this rated so highly?,"I bought this item on the strength of the good reviews. After going through about five toaster ovens, this is the second worst one I have owned. You can't adjust the temperature; you can't simply ""bake""; the back of this oven comes down at a sharp angle so it's hard to fit in items that are taller than 1"" or you end of with smoke; it absolutely can't toast without leaving burn marks all over the bread. All in all, a poorly designed toaster oven that is going straight to the garbage once I purchase a new one."
2,"Makes great toast, but not pizza or fish!","I should say it did make great toast until the heating elements started working intermittently and unevenly. We bought this unit about two years ago to replace a broken cheaper ""toaster oven"" thinking that a more expensive digital convection oven would be better. Not so! The old toaster oven was great for heating pizza, broiling fish etc. A convection oven may be good for baking, but it doesn't broil, and before the heating elements started acting up we had talked about replacing it and we will now go back to a old style toaster oven which more suits our needs."
2,Need 375 degrees? SORRY...,"Have owned this oven now for 2 years. I thought the temerature control that only allows certain discrete temps would not be a problem, but it is. Packaged items always seem to need a different temperature than you can set, and you have to decide whether to set it higher or lower, and then cook for a longer or shorter time. This results in unacceptable results on a lot of foods. And it seems to be that way for no other reason than to be able to call the controls ""digital"", without having to have a keypad and numeric display (this also goes for the timer, which works fine)."
4,BEST TOASTER OVEN,I HAVE HAD MANY TOASTER OVENS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS OR SO AND THIS SO FAR IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE FOUND. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS OR DISASTERS WITH THE UNIT AND I HOPE IT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION WELL FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS A PLEASURE TO USE.
2,Was excellent till it broke down,"As other reviewers have mentioned, i too loved this toaster oven until the top element went out. To have the element replaced, it will cost almost half of what I paid for the oven itself. I've had it for 2 years so if you're ok with a short life span, this toaster oven is an option. Otherwise, I really loved all the features of this toaster oven."
2,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"This was my wife's and my third toaster oven so we have a fair amount of experience to base our judgement on. We also did a lot of shopping around before buying so we had a pretty good idea what the options were. We eventually settled on this Sanyo based on reviews (mostly) and price (somewhat).Unfortunately, I have to say this oven really did not live up to its positive reviews. Our biggest complaint was that, due to the design of the oven (it has a slanted rear ""ceiling"" that cuts into the cooking space significantly), it cannot effectively be used for baking and it toasts VERY unevenly from front to back.I really love the one touch toast feature and I don't understand why this isn't standard on all toaster ovens but that doesn't compensate for the fact that is is a very poor oven and not a good toaster either."
4,"Not perfect, but makes perfect toast","After the disaster that was my last toaster, this one is a welcome change. It just makes great toast. Unfortunately, the temperature control on the convection oven did not work. After jumping through a few hoops with the very-friendly customer service, I'm going to get a new one sent to me. All-in-all I've been happy with the purchase and look forward to trying out the working convection oven when it gets here."
2,Sanyo Toaster oven,"I bought this toaster oven 18 months ago. It does not toast any more. The non-stick tray that came with it was of a poor quality and is ready to be thrown away. I regret giving away my Black and Decker toaster oven to Goodwill. At least Black and Decker had a better customer service.Sanyo SK-VF7S Digital Convection Oven, Stainless Steel Finish"
2,"Stylish, yet UNsophisticated","It was nice-looking and given that I am an avid toaster oven user, I was excited to take one out of the box. However, even before I tried cooking anything significant, after plugging it in, I wanted to duck as it seemed a small aircraft was taking off. . . or at least it sounded like it. This machine was way tooo loud. It went back into the box. I even hoped I was wrong about the loudness and liked the idea of push buttons (in lieu of the dials my old toaster oven had) so, as my husband came home and I took it out of the box again to get a second opinion. His first reaction was""that's horrendous"". I sincerely hope it was a shipping bang up and that others have been able to enjoy this product as I have yet to see another review cite the loudness. Just beware. . . that was our issue and this was the first product I've ever had to return to amazon (out of maybe, 50 purchases)."
3,"I like it, except for...","...its stainless steel body. Hard to keep smudge marks off. Also, timer does not move, that is, when you set it to 10 minutes, say, the button does not move to show how much time is left. I like the push buttons for setting the temperature and starting, though, and the fact that the interior tray automatically comes out when the door is opened. Size is the smallest I could find, although it's not as compact as my previous countertop oven. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied."
5,Sanyo SK-VF7S toaster oven,The name is a little confusing as many people have commented..not really digital.. but that really isn't important. The unit is very stylish and works as well or better than advertised. I have yet to see one on anyones retail shelf which I thought was odd. Features are very good and you'll be happy with this purchase.
3,Achtung! It Doesn't Broil!,"Seems like it works as advertised, but who would have thought to double-check to confirm that the thing broils? Not me. Mea culpa. It's like double-checking to make sure that your new refrigerator has a freezer compartment. I don't know what sort of manufacturing cheapskatery militated against including a broil feature, or whether it's just some really ridiculous design flaw, but you feel a frisson of terror when you're standing there with your nine million dollar per pound lamb choplettes hoping to Christ that the oven doesn't bake them into a pair of the world's most expensive hockey pucks. Who knows, maybe there *is* a way to make it broil and it's a great all-round oven with the world's most counterintuitive control panel and dumbest operating instructions. Stranger things have happened."
2,liked it while it lasted,"mine was ok.. toast was always not too perfect, had to turn it over etc, annoying. In my 3rd year of owning it the top burner element stopped working! booo!"
4,Sanyo SK-VF7S Toaster oven,This toaster oven does not take up much room and does a fine job with toasting bread and English muffins which is our primary use of the toaster. We have also found that it will do a fine job roasting a potato especially if you put the potato in the microwave on high for 5 minutes. Then put the potato in the oven at 400 or 320 for 30-45 minutes.
4,Proticall for protection against fleas and ticks works & less expensive than others,"I began using Proticall almost a year ago on my two dogs. They are mainly in the house, but we had been bringing fleas in probably on our shoes at times. I had to clean and fumigate the entire house just due to a few fleas. Once I got that under control, I began using this product, and I have seen no more fleas at all. A huge plus is that it is a great deal less expensive that some of the other well known brand names."
2,Disappointed...,I have several small dogs (shih tzu's and shihpoo's) and have used Proticall in the past and have been quit pleased. I even have sold it or suggested it to people from my grooming salon. This last order though it didn't seem to work. I don't know what is wrong but am very disappointedl.
5,Encouragement to RIDE,"Although I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast, when a friend gave me Crossing America, I read it from cover to cover, twice. The freedom, joy, and sense of accomplishment conveyed by the author have encouraged me to look at motorcyclists in a different way. I even find myself giving someone obviously on a long-distance trip, a thumbs up as I go by! While the preparation and planning are very well covered (I imagine), I particularly enjoyed the musings and philosophical thread woven throughout the book."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry--crossing the USA via interstates and Super 8 motels is not my idea of an adventure. The author seems overly concerned with scratching the paint on his bike. The endless references to ""genuine"" H-D accesories, e.g. bike cover, gaiters, jacket, is tedious. Advice is obvious and superficial. Much better books for the motorcycle traveler are available. On how to ride, see ""Proficient Motorcycling"", for adventure touring see ""Adventure Motorcycling Handbook""."
1,Record Lable RIPOFF,"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!This album is NOT sanctioned by the band, it is simply Island Records attempt to milk money from the bands name. The band had no input about the song selections or release of this album. Island records dropped the band cold and has the nerve to release this album! LEECHES!DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,GOOD WAY TO KNOW ANTHRAX!!!!!,"This compilation from ANTHRAX got some of their most well know songs....IF you want the BASIC tunes that made ANTHRAX one of the greatest HEAVY METAL bands of all time, this could please your interest....but there[s no songs from the AMAZING debut FISTFUL OF METAL?!? and really, many GREAT songs are missing...well, if you want the BASIC ANTHRAX, this is for you!!!!!"
3,not complete,Madhouse is an attempt at a greatest hits album for anthrax but falls short because many of the bands greatest songs like antisocial and ball of confusion are missing. Try getting Attack of the Killer A's instead.
5,Guitarist?,"This is Nils Gessinger! Thank you for your kind review - exquisite! Unfortunately I do not play the guitar although I'd love to! My main instrument is the Fender Rhodes. You might like to check that out listening to my new CD ""Jam It Up!"" feat. Dave Weckl on http://www.nilsgessinger.de Best wishes Nils"
4,Good everyday soap,"This soap smells good and is easy on the skin. The only reason it only gets four stars is because it says maximum strength, 30% is actually the maximum strength for neem oil soaps and this one is only 20%. 20% is the minimum required for skin fungal issues. So it still is right there where it needs to be and it doesn't smell like neem. Overall a consistent, well made product."
2,Okay but I wouldn't buy it again.,"This book does a decent job of defining and describing craps but John Gollehon is a terrible writer. I would recommend Edwin Silberstang's ""Winning Casino Craps"" as a much better book for a person who wants to win. After reading Silberstang's book, I won over $800. You will not get that from this book."
5,Craps,"I went to the casino after reading the book, I didn't feel intimidated at the table. I didn't win all the time but I did come out ahead.Very basic instructions you can add as much play as you want, I found it best to stick with the recommended bets only."
3,Decent greatest hits,"I love county from the 90s, as once stated in my Clint Black review. Here is anther star who is around but doesnt get much attention. I use to listen to Joe Diffie but know when I look back, he really didnt have alot of good songs. His best song on this cd is Home. There are a few other radio hits on this cd but they do not age well with time."
5,This Is A Great CD.,"I Like Joe's Songs Alot. He Is A Great Singer. I Like The Songs: Home, Ships That Don't Come In, John Deere Green, And Bigger Then The Beatles. That Is What This CD Lives Up Too!!!!!!"
5,Strange Paradise,"These are good supernatural fiction books, very interesting, based on the Canadian TV series of the early 70's. I had them back then. Hadn't read them in many years, glad I bought them again."
1,Too OLD,I purchased this item through the school I work at to use with my children with Autism. It worked so well when I used it a few years ago. The seller did not mention what operating system this software uses and therefore was not compatible with our system. Now I am stuck with this useless software and half of my yearly budget gone.
1,Dare I repeat myself?,"The book starts off with an interesting premise -- public relations on the Internet is inherently different than public relations using uncontrolled media. But it fails to move beyond the premise and the promise. After reading the first few pages, you have the core of Witmer's idea. The rest is simply the same idea repeated over and over and over!I salute Witmer for tackling this issue -- there will be a lot more books on this topic to follow. But this would have made a better article in a public relations journal than a book."
5,Soulful Spirituality,"By this, his third album as a leader, Leon Parker had almost abandoned traditional jazz entirely. This album is full of mysterious percussion textures, memorable melodies and hypnotic rhythms. It's beautifully recorded and totally original. It somehow manages to be incredibly refined while also being wonderfully relaxed, like a group of drummers in Central Park on a summer Sunday. Anyone who enjoys music with a spiritual dimension will like this CD."
3,An interesting depiction of personal philosophy realized,"In an unusual plot for a science fiction genre, Cherryh portrays two friends who combat their philosophies through their creativity. One through political manipulation and the other through artistic endeavor. The depth of character development centers around the artist and his genius. In his effort to create an ever-more transcending sculpture, he discovers that interpersonal relationships (through the device of a minority class race) are in an arena he has totally missed, as has the rest of his society. I enjoyed this book, and have become more interested in stories like it since reading it. My only problem with the book is that its too short - not much of any aspect of the story is explored outside of the artist and his progression. Also, his realizations are only quickly described, leaving the reader with a lot to imagine on their own."
4,"Great book, horrible Kindle edition","This is an excellent book... it's an unusual story by Cherryh's standards, sort of philosophical sci-fi; if you're a Cherryh fan you should certainly read it. As an introduction to Cherryh, though, I'd recommend one of her more accessible books, like Pride of Chanur.Specifically, though, talking about the Kindle edition (as of 03 Mar 2009)... DON'T. It's a TERRIBLE copy. It reads like a totally unproofed optical scan of the book, ""hurry, snap those shots and let's release this puppy."" It is full of misspelled words, misplaced words, odd margins, and especially it is missing a lot of punctuation, just what you'd expect from an unproofed OCR scan of a book. I'm muddling through but I highly recommend you buy a paper copy until they redo this one, if they ever do."
4,A decent Jazz compilation for the Intermediate Jazz pianist,"Some of the more popular tunes in this compilation are A night in Tunisia, Satin Doll, Sophisticated Lady and All the things you are. Missing out on classics like Take the A-train in lieu of several rather obscure tunes that aren't exactly Jazz standards, by my measure, is the book's greatest flaw. For the beginning to intermediate jazz student, its a nice book to own. All the songs are full arrangements and not too difficult to play. Advanced pianists will probably be happier with a nice, solid fakebook."
5,An Attack of Fun!,"Upon seeing the game case in my local electronic boutique, I saw the headline ""Move fast. Think Fast. Have Fun!"" After a month of addicting and enthralling gameplay, I can say one thing; I moved fast, thought fast, and definietely had fun! For anyone who loves fast paced thinking packaged with ground-breaking graphics and hours of fun, ""Jack Attack 2"" is a must have"
1,I'd say entirely worthless.,"Stirner's work is clearly of an anarchist nature. Putting this in a series of Fascist authors is just intellectual dishonesty and distorted logic. Stirner's entire argument is that the individual should not be subordinated to any state, God, etc.; it is a call for autonomy in line with other individualist/anarchist writings.Look for other editions of this book if you have any interest in Stirner or his ideas."
3,Targus Case CKT500,"Product features and price yield an acceptable value. One shortcoming: the rubber handle for the case is uncomfortable. Additionally, I suggest that the flap closure for the outside pocket is removed and just have a zipper closure. Finally, turning the laptop compartment to be top loading would be a strong enhancement."
2,Too Cumbersome,"Bag is ""designed"" to handle a 17"" lap top but, they forgot to tell you that if you carry a 17"" it will not accomodate the power cord and brick. Found multitude of pockets distracting it was like a frustrating treasure hunt when I wanted to find something quickly. When filled, bag is lop-sided and continually falls over rather than set upright like other cases. Not very impressed."
5,The best Notebook Case,"I've had several cases... and this is by far the best. I like it better than the $250 Tumi case I have. Just so practical. Love the clamshell design so you just lay the case flat and set the computer in, rather than slipping it in sideways from the top. Good storage, compartments, and excellent protection. The large one can fit a 17"" laptop, but also has a piece to secure a smaller laptop in place."
3,Not what I expected.,When look at the pictures on this notebook case it gives you the impression that your investment on a laptop will be well protected. Well think twice. I bought a Macbook pro and I didn't want to put it in just a nice case with lots of compartments (as this is the case with this bag. Lots of nice compartments) but my theme was protection for my investment.The sides are soft although it looks tough and God forbids your case gets knocks over Im afraid this case will not give the right protection. And is very pricey too.
5,twister623,"This product was exactly what I had been looking for in a carrying case. I do not use it for a notebook, but I do carry a small pocketbook in it plus a hardback novel and all my electrical gadgets. The comparments and two cord cases help me keep all of it organized. Occasionally I even put part of my lunch in there.With all those ""supplies"" in it, the case has a simple, sleek look and does not appear to ""busting at the seams"" like my old leather notebook case did."
5,Remarkable book,"In this remarkable book, Dr. Ruth Judy explores the soulful stories of those who have longed to give birth, their struggles to let go of this deep heart's desire and to find courage to embrace what life brings. Ruth offers a community of support to those who are meeting this challenge, as well as to their families and friends. All their experiences, both conscious and unconscious, result in a birth of emotional and spiritual courage. This is a wonderful book for anyone searching for deep spiritual meaning or resolution of conflict, especially in oneself.Pat Luce, MA, Co-President of the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, mother of five children (two adopted) and author of ""Where East Meets West, A Story of Healing and Hope."""
4,Out of print,Since this album is out of print the prices have become ridiculous. It is available for download on emusic.
5,great series,great series love dbz been watching it since i was 5 great product good selelrs would do business again a
5,Both Movies,"Are beyond words, simple amazing! Trust me, you would probably watch them more than twice!"
4,Nice collection,These are two great movies and I enjoyed watching both. This dvd had the same treatment as the boxset DBZ DVD's. Although I love the case it comes in. So no actual special features here. Suprisingly I got my sister into DBZ after watching The History of Trunks. So now she's really into the whole series. So I do recommend this to anyone who's really into the DBZ story.
2,Not Really Worth It,"It's literally exactly like the first guy said on this review page. The U.S. music is falsely advertised as being Dolby TrueHD 5.1 when it is really just regular 2.0. Most especially did I notice, even though I was most upset about the lack of 5.1, was the terrible video quality for The History of Trunks. It really does not look very good and I can definitely say that I've seen it some of the best quality equipment you can get. It really doesn't look or sound very great. Other then that it's great. Both movies are still as awesome as they always have been, but the serious and obvious lack of effort by Funimation and whoever else is kind of disturbing."
2,Definitely Lacking,"These aren't movies, they are one hour specials meant for cable (so they're actually each roughly 45 minutes). So all in all you only get a hour and a half of material with no, and I mean absolutely NO, bonus features.Each movie is pretty good in it's own right, but they aren't worth 22 dollars. $10...maybe $15 is all this featureless compilation is worth.If you have seen these before and know what you are getting into then by all means decide for yourself if you'd like to purchase this. However, if you haven't seen these two movies, you should pass this up and try to find some place to watch them on the web, or wait until it's cheap. I wish I would have."
4,Classic If I do say so myself,This product is not high quality but it is something that is a memory to myself. There is something about these 2 dragonball z movies that makes me love them. I purchased this knowing they were not bluray because you cannot take something and make it better quality. I was impressed however with the way the show looked and I am very pleased with this purchase. I also paid like 10 dollars new which is well worth it. I recommend this to any dragonball z fan with a bluray player and a couple extra dollars
4,Spin off's of the past,"This dvd set is basicly two DBZ movies, one about Goku's dad Bardock, and one about Trunks and his childhood in ""his"" future until he changed it. Overall it's two pretty good movies."
4,History of Trunks/Bardock Double Feature,"The 4 star rating comes from just the movies themselves - both are great. It seems like all Funimation did to transfer any of the DBZ movies to HD was increase the default brightness. When the explanation of how the Broly movie was transferred to HD came on, it compared the new footage to the original Japanese footage, and the original Footage looked better. In my opinion, the movies are just better off bought on DVD(at least so far - The Tree of Might may be different). If you want anime on blu-ray save it for Jin-Roh or Akira."
4,A nice alternative to the fuzzy books,"My 11 month old is becoming quite a fan of this book. Ring, ring, ring and tick, tock make him laugh. The squeak is fun too. It's a nice change to the typical furry touch books. And it is another chance to give him kisses!"
2,Mis-direction,"Though graced by superb voices, this CD is a demonstration of Philips' tendency toward questionable musicianship. Bizarre part registrations and terrible intra-ensemble balance often conspire to completely obliterate Victoria's carefully crafted polyphony and undermine some remarkable sonorities. As someone who's performed several of the responsories I was disappointed by a seeming lack of interpretive uniformity. Thought it presents a unique and interesting performance, I woud recommend this not be the only recording of Victoria's Tenebrae Responsories in anyone's collection."
4,Massage Bible,Really good reference book. Pretty comprehensive. Explains and defines many conditions and the specific treatments for increasing ROM and pain management.
3,"Great Pictures of ""Godzilla Raids Again""","This book really isn't all that good in the info department, but it does have alot of great pictures from the movie ""Godzilla Raids Again"" (1955). Thats is pretty much it. Everything else is pretty much incorrect. (Examples) There were 2 endings to ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"". They call Angilius ""Anzilla"". They call Gorosaurus ""Baragon"" (they could of gotten that confused because in ""Destroy All Monsters"" thats what the news guy calls him.)"
2,An ill-researched kids' book,"Godzilla films are a subject of interest to many children, and it would have been nice to have an intelligent book on the subject written for a juvenile audience. Unfortunately, this book is a bare-bones look at the movies, and many of the author's facts are wrong. I can only reccomend this book to completists and for very small children."
5,New York as a Haven for the Estranged,"While reading this book, many strange feelings and associations flitted through my mind: have I never noticed the beauty and lonliness of New York? Does lonliness cause people to search for higher truths? And- is New York the only place where insanity can adapt?This is a striking book. It will hit many chords of sympathy between yourself and the protagonist. Until suddenly, you are hit with sickening differences."
4,Bogen-Manfrotto 3021BPRO Professional Tripod,"This tripod is not for backpacking (it's heavy), but if what you are looking for is great stability then this tripod won't let you down. Even with both the legs and the head fully extended, I've had no problem with exposures up to 5sec (the longest I've taken so far), and it easily handles my heaviest lens, a 200-500mm, 9.3lb zoom."
5,Quailty...,"I've only used my 3021bpro for a week now, but I couldn't see ever going back to a lesser tripod. The construction on the tripod is absolutely perfect. Many of the nuts on the tripod are nylock, virtually the entire tripod is metal, and it still retains a reasonable weight. I can see this tripod will be around for a long time.It is stable, very stable, and adjustable in the extreme. I haven't used it yet, but the center adjustable rod can be removed and inserted horizontally for overhead and extremely low shots.In short if you want a stable, solid, adjustable, well constructed tripod this one should be on your short list."
5,SUPER and highly recommended!!!,This thing is truly an excellent tripod! It's not light however so don't expect to take it hiking too far! Sturdy and perfect for those looooong shutters!!
5,One of the best accessories I own.,"This tripod is one of the best accessories I have purchased for my camera. I've used it on the beach, indoors, baseball fields, and for takeing pictures of waterfalls. It seems to be infinitely adjustable for any need I have had. I really love the idea of mounting the arm horizontally for macro work. Great tripod for the money and not too heavy to carry around on a long hike."
1,"junk, failed twice in less than 12 months","I purchased this mixer in Feb 08 for home recording and occasional use with my PA.The effects failed after 3 months and it had to go back to Phonic for repair. The submix pot has always been scratchy and is getting worse, now the firewire interface has failed (no return from computer) and the right output channel has an intermittent failure (sometimes low output and distorted).If you are looking for a reliable mixer I suggest you look elsewhere. It is going back again for a possible replacement but I don't hold out any hope that it will be any better. I am now forced to buy a new mixer from a more reliable manufacturer."
5,The Book That United Italy,"Excellent historical reference. Before Artusi, there was no national Italian cuisine. Shortly before Artusi, only 5% of Italians spoke Italian. As a cookbook, this is of marginal value as recipes are usually non-specific as to quantity. For those interested in the art of cooking, it is well worth the time."
4,A very interesting look at Hawaii in the 1860s.,It was particularly interesting to read Mark Twain's account of the lava flowing in Kilauea crater. That was a much more active time for Kilauea that the current lava flows there. I also very much enjoyed Twain's humor.
3,great stories - terrible editing,"This is a very fun read, but it is sad and annoying to see so many glaring spelling mistakes! The editors of this publication should be ashamed. Even if Twain himself made the spelling mistakes, they owe it to him and his legacy to publish a better edition where they have used a spell-check! Come on!"
4,Great little space heater,"We have a gas furnace that I don't like to use because it makes the living room too insanely hot unless it is 20 below, so instead we have two of these in the living room. They work great. They are ideal for anyone with pets because they turn off if they get too hot or are knocked over (which happens a good bit in my case because I have a blind beagle). I will caution you, however, that you will notice a spike in the electric bill if you let them run constantly. I would recommend using them supplementally instead of as a primary source of heat."
4,Great size and easy to move,I used this last winter in my dining room while I worked at home and it was great. It's not too noisy and it is very stable. I wish it looked a bit more stylish for where I had it.
2,Dun nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh BACKWARDS,"We live overseas and ordered the costumes with enough time before Halloween. We pulled our 4 costumes out of the bags and realized the batman cape/hood are sewn together backwards. So his cape is in front, not back. Grrr... and there's no direct line to call anyone about this issue and get a replacement before the big day. My 4 year old doesn't understand why Batman can't wear his cape."
4,decent product,"good quality product, although it is hot inside this thing, and almost impossible to take a leak with it on. otherwise good costume for the money."
3,not true to size,"the costume looks and feels exactly how i thought it would. bought it for my boyfriend, he usually wears a med-large in clothing, so i got him the med in this. it was a little too big :( i wanted to return it but i had to pay an extra $13 for shipping back.. not worth it, selling it on craigslist now"
2,cute costume but not worth the MONEY,it's hot in there - they charge way too much money for these things. the mask is very flimsey also.
5,Heartwarming and Funny,Pat Brady is a very expressive artist and I absolutely love these comic strips!
2,Expected Features Lacking,"I expected a 3-mailbox system to have three passwords for remote reterival of messages. Instead, there is only one, which means that everyone knows what each other's messages are.The directions are also a bit confusing, although I finally stumbled through the set up.Otherwise the unit works fine!"
1,Speaker didn't work - had to return it,"I am another person who couldn't even set up the unit since the speaker didn't work when I opened the box. It might be an okay unit, but since I received a defective one, I will never know. I saw others had received defective units, but thought it wouldn't happen to me. I took a chance and lost. Seems like AT & T has a quality assurance problem if they are shipping lots of units with problems. Steer clear..."
4,"Zero maintenance, great features. You'll like it.","This machine appears to be an updated version of the AT&T 1725 that gave me excellent service for many years. It requires zero maintenance (no battery), and offers all the features I need at an exceedingly low price. The only complaints I have are that the button labels are too small to read in poor light and the speaker is small, giving less fidelity than I would have liked. If this unit lasts as well as the older one, I will be delighted."
1,Did not pick up short messages at all,"I thought I'd be getting a funtional machine, but it literally doesn't record messages of 10 seconds or less. This is an impossible situation for those who sometimes get short messages as you will not even know you received them!I'm going to try to return it."
1,Never Worked,"The machine never worked. It randomly plays the outgoing message for no apparent reason, even when there's no incoming phone call. After wading through a very long menu of options at the tech support number I got to a person and was told I'd have to return it at my expense, even though it's in warranty.If you look at other sites with reviews on this machine you'll see that my experience that the unit didn't function correctly isn't unique.Save your money!"
2,Another disappointment,"I bought this machine, hoping it would be an impovement to a simliar digital model by Sony. I notice no difference, except that programming seems to be a bit less intuitive than my old machine. Also disappointing is the machine's sound quality. My outgoing message rises and falls in volume, sounds muffled and is generally pretty warbled. Remote access is unreliable. I haven't come across a good digital machine yet and am beginning to wonder if it exists at all."
3,Hangup after 3 min OR 7 sec of silent,"Machine look good and with good voice quality. However, this machine is like all answering machines, it limits each message to 3 minutes then hang up. It also hangs up if it detected 7 seconds of silent. I bought this machine for business, I hate it when it cut my customers off if they happen to leave long message or speak too slow. ATT model 1343 does not have limit on the message length, but they no longer make them. If anyone know of answering machine without such limitation, please share your info via your review."
1,Unusable,"This answering machine has extremely poor audio quality, both on the outgoing message and on incoming recorded messages. The quality is so poor that the content of the messages is totally lost."
4,Better than the reviews suggest,"I like this machine a lot; I was especially attracted by the longer recording time. I'm often gone for several weeks, so a 15-minute limit won't hack it.The biggest problem is that the built-in microphone is very poor, so your own greeting message will sound terrible. The workaround is to use the remote-access capability and change the greeting message from a friend's phone.Some of the controls are non-intuitive, and the manual is really poor. It took a lot of trial-and-error to figure out how to set the greeting message -- a very basic operation."
2,Works OK - controls are a pain...,"Does what it is supposed to do, but the control interface and 'button clicking' processes to get to the programming menus are a pain...."
3,"Good machine, but has problems","I purchased this machine because it stores 40 minutes of messages. I had no problems setting it up and mine works exactly as it should. It does have many useful features. My first issue has been covered in a previous review. The date announcement includes the day, time, and year, but not the month and date. That is pretty darn careless--hard to believe you could put out a product without realizing that.The other issue is that once you have listened to new messages, there is no way to listen to the most recent message again without starting from the beginning and listening to every single saved message. I searched and searched the documentation thinking that a device such as this could not possibly lack that capability...but it does. If it were not for the fact that this thing is cheap and there are so few other choices on the market, I wouldn't be using it. Admittedly it has held up for several years."
4,Great Answering machine,"I bought this machine over two years ago and it kept working great until I sold it. The machine has three separate mail box options for voice mail. One of my favorite features is that it can call out the number calling and when the party leaves you a message, it can be set to keep that call quiet. This is a simple device that has really good sound quality. If you need an answering machine for your home or office, you can't go wrong with this digital machine."
1,A Piece of Junk!!!,"Do not waste your money on this product! I ahve had it only a few weeks and already it is broken. The recording is inaudible, and you cannot trepeat messages before they get erased! JUNK!!!"
5,Great inexpensive answering machine,This little machine does a great job for very little cost. We have tried call notes and other machines but with the features it offers there is none better. The call announce allows us to screen calls without getting up.
1,Sound Quality Fails,"I was impressed with the compact size and fairly easy operation of the AT&T 1726. But that was about all I was impressed with. The description of the unit emphasizes it's sound quality. I guess it doesn't say that it's ""good"", though. I should have know. After recording my message many times using different distances from the unit and even using remote access, I was still unable to barely recognize what the announcement says. The playback and recording quality is equally poor. After spending the money on mine and after only 1 month in service, I sold it at a garage sale for $2. Believe me, the buyer got took.... both times!"
1,Misleading brochure information on customer service,"This answering machine has poor quality of speech reproduction and apparently no way to play back messages when trying to retrieve missed information. The brochure says, ""For Customer Service or Product Information, Visit our Website at www.telephones.att.com.""; however, this website is concerned ONLY with telephone calling services and denies any connection with electronic products. They refer to their Ask Allie service (att.com/allie) which, again, is exclusively related to telephone calling. I had no choice but to give it 1 star; it doesn't deserve even 1."
1,Keep looking - this ain't the one you want,"If you are looking for a quality answering machine, click that ""Next"" button, because this isn't the one you want. If you order it, save the box.. you'll be needing it.The positives:a) Cheap.b) Small footprint.The negatives:a) Cheap.. very cheaply made in Communist Chinab) Controls not well thought out... very small and difficult to read. On/Off button right in the middle of the display. Other features difficult to find.c) Instructions are horrible. I'm a techno-geek, but I couldn't figure out how to setup the personal greetings... no matter how carefully followed the lousy directions (translated from Mandarin, perhaps?) I couldn't get the machine to record my greeting.Keep looking... this one isn't worth the aggravation you'll endure with it."
1,Don't buy this machine,"I had a terrible time with this machine, it was too complicated and it was too confusing to set up. Plus, I called customer service three seperate times and they were less than helpful, they didn't know what the problem was and they couldn't troubleshoot it. I eventually got so frustrated that I returned it. I haven't been impressed lately with what AT&T has been producing, because our phone isn't that great either and it's from them as well. This machine, with all of its features, seems like it would work well, but I found it to be daunting and a waste of my precious work time figuring it out, only for it to not work in the end. Don't buy this unless you have an excess amount of money and a surplus of time on your hands to waste!"
2,Affording-the-world-hanging-around,"A simple watching of a simple story is about booze, one-night-sex and ridiculing the local habits of different countries while spreading ashes of a ceased person in some of them.Probably, importing an organic substance is illegal to many of these places as well as a tourist behavior screened. A link between affording-the-world-hanging-around is unclear also they were called ""friends"" in a film short description.Somehow mirroring reality those tourists' impressions."
4,Last Stop For Paul,"I bought this movie for a friend, who'd heard about it elsewhere. When it arrived, we watched it together. It's funny and engaging, and at times very heartwarming. It's no wonder that it's won so many Independent Film Awards! I liked it so much, I bought a copy for myself!"
4,"An airy, jazz-inspired slice of classical americana.","Forget everything you know about Bowles the writer, his music occupys an entirely different landscape. He studied under both Aron Copland and Vigil Thompson. The influence shows, the flavor is unmistakenly american. By no means a major composer Bowles often worked on theater music for such notables as Tennesse Williums, Orson Wells, Saroyan, and many others. His music is as light and dreamy as a lush spring day. The notes jump and leap about with the youthful energy of jazz inspired classical music. This album rather reminded me of a Mona painting, with its impressionist sounds, very pastoral and airy. A great album to listen to while watching the clouds drift by the sheltering sky..."
5,thank you,This CD is wonderful. If you have had too busy a day or had too much of CNN - this is an excellent antidote.
2,Sorry...,I hate to disagree with all of the lauded praise for this album. It did absolutely nothing for me.
3,Beginner Text,"As an intermediate player I learned little from reading this book. However, I passed it to a beginning player and he learned alot from this publication."
2,Great case until Treo slips out and breaks,"When I first got this case, I loved it. The Krusell clip system is the best out there. But after a few weeks, the stickyness of the inside of case wasn't sticky anymore and the phone doesn't stay in the case.Because the clip pivot is near the center, the phone spends a lot of time upside down because top of Treo is heavier than bottom.Then it slides out and hits the ground. Why Krusell didn't put any strap or something to hold the Treo in more securely, I'll never know???Krusell, you owe me $400 for my Treo 650 replacement!"
3,Krusell treo 650 case,"I really like the case except for one problem, after a few months the phone falls out of it. The phone goes upside down and then falls out of the case because the leather has stretched. You could solve that problem by adding a strap to the case at the top. Other then that I love the case."
2,MIA,"After searching for hours finding the right cover to replace my old Verizon model, I settled on this one and ordered it from another online store because the price was lower. It never came so I got a refund. This particular model shows different features on different sites so I can't order from Amazon without more pictures. Hence I wait."
4,Bueno,"Esta nuevo y mi esposa no ha tenido problemas con él aunque por lo que se ve da la apariencia que con el tiempo el teléfono se saldra del estuche, perfecto si lo ocupa una mujer que siempre lo tiene dentro de su cartera."
3,Not what i expected!,"my sister wanted this and she sent me the link...it said ""Dog"" so i figured it was the dog one, well when i recived it, it was the bee which is not very cute at all! i called the company to ask why i didnt get the dog when my order said dog and so did the print out that came with the product! and he said that they just send out any of the 12 style bookmarks, but said that he would look and if the dog bookmark was in stock he would send it to me, but of couse it wasnt! so not very happy with haveing to give these ugly bees to my sister!"
5,Perfect for a young reader,"The only thing I didn't like was I couldn't choose which 'animal' I was going to receive. I didn't see an option for that, but it could have been there and I just missed it. I have major MOMMY brain! But we received the...well I can't remember which one we got now, but whatever it was, it was super cute and I sent it to my niece and she loved it too! And my daughter who doesn't read yet liked them too!"
5,Halt Coronary Artery Disease,Loved it. Very informative. I have coronary artery disease and ti imparted very useful dietary information Helpful in preventing the disease and halt the progression of the disease.
4,Interesting DVD that Will Open Your Eyes,"A quick way to bring yourself up to date with how to live a healthier life. Fact based information that will make you think twice about what you eat, your current and long term health, and your general well being. Do you want to lose weight without going on a fad diet? Do you want to save money on food you eat and vitamins you take?Then, I recommend watching this video. But, be warned ... this video may lead you to read additional books .... it may cause you to make changes in your diet."
5,Great Movie,"This was a little slow so don't try to watch it late at night. I recommend watching early on a Saturday morning before the rest of the family is up and distracting you. In any case, there can never be enough documentaries made to reinforce the importance of eating well. This one is chock full of information. I particularly liked the commentaries by doctors/biochemists who have studied the impact of diet on health and/or have incorporated plant based diets into their treatment plans. I actually plan to do more research on some of them because they were so amazing. It was also interesting to hear the case studies of people recovering from common diseases like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, arthritis, etc. As the narrator says in the movie, ""whole plant based foods are beneficial to human health and animal based foods are not""."
2,Great documentary but no SPANISH SUB-TITLES as stated!,This is a great documentary and have now started the 21-day Kickstart by Dr. Neal D. Barnard as a result. I wanted to show it to my family which some don't speak English but as the website states that it does have Spanish subtitles it DOES NOT. If you want a copy with Spanish sub-titles you will need to goto the Forks Over Knives website.
5,Changes your life,"This movie was a gift and I enjoyed it so much I bought several more copies to give to loved ones. I have taken a whole food plant based food product, Juice Plus+ for 5 years now and as a result, have been on a journey to improve my health. This film is so well made, it motivated me to virtually eliminate animal and dairy from my diet. As a result, I lost about 8 lbs that have been hard for me to eliminate up until this time. Do yourself a favor and watch this film periodically. It is life changing!"
5,a must see,"Everyone needs to watch this movie, you will definitely change the way you eat after watching this. Filled with good information, and a scary look into reality if people don't change what they eat."
5,Eye opening,"It is amazing the education Americans are lacking about the link between our health and what we eat. The old saying ""you are what you eat"" is right on the money."
5,"Invest the time to watch it, even if it means skipping a burger.","I'd known there were significant differences in the health (and obvious obesity rates) between Western and Eastern cultures as a result of diet, but did not imagine they were so extreme.The movie motivated me to make moderate improvements to my own diet which has already proven to have improved my sleep and energy level in just two weeks. I'm highly unlikely to ever go vegetarian or vegan but will be eating far less processed meat, sugar and other ""formulated stuff"" in the future.Like other reviewers have observed there are usually studies that can contradict each other and perhaps dispell some of what is shown here. I would suggest there is no magic bullet to cure all Diabetes, cancer, coronary disease and to take in all the facts, work with a healthcare professional and improve your own diet and lifestyle accordingly."
2,Educational but not ever engaging,The movie was very educational but found myself forcing to finish it. This is something I have probably seen in health class as a kid.
4,Totally worth it,"I found this video to be very informative with a lot of really great information. There are a couple areas that I would of liked to be discussed a little longer. (like the effects oils have on you) ....but other then that, I have been sharing the video with everyone I can think of and even bought an extra copy so I could give it out."
5,VERY thought provoking,"the whole family watched this, riveted. we're all searching more about this. May be a new life style eatting for us."
5,Inspiring,I really enjoyed this simply because if you have an open mind it will inspire you to eat and live better. I have been vegan for several years now. But my carnivore boyfriend actually went vegan because of this movie. And he looks and feels awesome. He lost almost 40 lbs without even trying in less than 3 months. And it even improved our sex life. He can keep up with me now.
3,"Good information, boring film","Too preachy and didactic, unfortunately. And way too LONG. Should have and could have made its points in under an hour. I don't understand why Gene Bauer of Farm Sanctuary (animal rights activist) is doing in a movie supposedly about health. Might be interesting in people new to plant based health, but it's just a boring film over all."
1,Faulty DVD,I bought a faulty Knives over forks DVD through you guys from EJ'S Library. Tried to play it on two different DVD players with no luck. So what can I do about it?
5,Life changing,Life changing. Grocery store visits no longer the same. Now making good decisions. Shared video with loved ones so they won't make the same mistakes.
4,My own experience...its true!,"I had flare ups on every joint in my body and damaged my knees,I'm 29 5.9 proper weight and no other health issues.I followed this diet for 3 months ..I had some draw backs but went from 173 to 155 pounds mostly fat lost and fell like 18 again my aches slowly disappearing. I noticed much more energy and I gain muscle much faster than before. I only eat natural foods i cook and still eat very small amounts of fish and 6 organic/free range eggs weekly. My MD laughed at my diet. Only time will tell but its been working so far..."
4,WHOA! Really makes me think.,I bought this for my health class and although the information is eye opening and really makes you think....it was just a little too long for what I needed.
1,save your money,"I bought this expecting to learn something and didn't. The video coverage is very old, poor quality, and really lacked the motivation and push to want to do it. I wish I could get my money back. Chose a different DVD if you want to buy one of these type of informative videos."
5,EXCELLENT INFORMATION,"Highly recommend this DVD for current, well-researched nutritional information. Follow-up with ENGINE 2 DIET with Rip Esselstyn! Your life will change for the better. Lauren D in Virginia."
5,Life changing,"Who knew one simple step could be so transformational. If your joints hurt, you are obese, diabetic or just sick of being sick it is a must read. And it works."
4,Fork over Knives,"This is a great, informative DVD that would be a great addition to Eating DVD. I must say that it has caused my husband and I to think more carefully about what we put into our stomachs, and it is way more than label reading. For those who want better health, or want to improve their overall health, I recommend it. I have gotten great results,and will continue to, thanks to the valuable information this DVD has. To your health!"
5,Eye Opening!,"This is a very informative, eyeopening movie! I was going to buy the book but was told about the movie... it is one of those ""you have to see it to believe it."" And trust me, you will never look at food the same way. If you are just slightly interested in changing the woy you live, you must see this film, you will not be disappointed!"
4,excellent program for changing your life,Loved this movie! So happy it didn't have any disgusting scenes of feedlots/slaughterhouses. It was very persuasive in moving to a vegetarian way of eating. I have changed my diet (little by little) after watching this documentary.
3,Dr. Recommended,"This is ok, particularly if you are a vegan--which I am not but my Dr. would like me to be.Makes a lot of sense in eating more veggies and never eating meat."
5,A must see,This documentary is a must see for everyone who is serious about changing their diet to enjoy a healthy body and a happy life.
5,Amazing!!,"This was a wonderful documentary, it helped me to realize how food can have a positive and negative effect on one's health. Many of the points that were discussed I was already aware of and others completely shocked me. Doctors dont want you to get healthy. That would mean their pockets would suffer. I loved the honesty and the science that confirmed the findings. Just awesome! Everyone take care of your selves and each other."
4,Forks Over Knives (The majority of Western diseases are linked to a meat based diet),"If you have an illness such as coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or other health problem ... this documentary can save your life and change the way you look at Western meat based diets forever. You owe it to yourself to view this film. Borrow it from your local library and if you believe it has a case and is worthwhile after viewing it, buy a couple of copies and distribute it amongst family and friends. They'll thank you for it!"
5,This Dvd Helped My Husband Embrace Veganism,Thankful for this Dvd. I am vegan and bought this for my husband to watch with me. He watched it and immediately saw a sensible and truly helpful way to become vegan for his own health. Since watching the Dvd he has been vegan and that has been almost 2 months now. I am grateful for the message and how it is presented that one can make food choices that will bring healing and vitality to ones body. Thank you for making this Dvd.
3,"Well put together, but I still like meat","I was interested in seeing this because I have been working hard on cleaning up my own diet over the last few years. While I definitely eat a lot more of vegetable than I did before, I still feel as though we eat meat for a reason. I have reduced the amount of red meat that I eat, but I will tell you that my iron never came up properly until I had gone back on red meat after being off of it for some time.Not every diet works for everyone. I know folks who have tried to go vegan and become ill. I know folks who have tried to do the Paleo diet and have become ill. I believe in finding out what works for you and keeps you healthy."
5,Best Dvd on Health out there!,"This dvd is truly the best movie out there on health. It is factual, and tells the complete truth about people's health today and what they need to do in order to get healthy. I highly highly highly recommend it to everyone! Anyone looking to improve their health NEEDS TO SEE this movie ! The China Study is also a great book to read, which is highlighted in this movie."
3,Not everything is true,"As a flexitarian, I agree with cutting out many of the helpings of meat people consume daily. But the documentary started to lose me when they went further and said dairy was basically bad for you. Pretty ridiculous, in my opinion."
4,forks!,I got it on time! Great purchase. In condition as said when I bought it. Don't eat meat!!! Yeah yeah
1,pseudo-science,"I saw this on netflix awhile back and it goes against everything you learn about in college sciences classes. For example, we evolved to eat meat and plants as our teeth and digestive track are optimal for both applications. I think the radical anti-meat people need to follow basic sciences and tell the world to reduce the amount of meat, not remove it."
3,Forks over knives,"I purchased Forks over Knives documentary and it was very informative. However I thought I as purchasing a new product, and my DVD had been opened before and there was a nice size scratch on the DVD about about 1.25"". The video played fine, just felt a little disappointed that it did not appear to be new."
1,Slow service,Pretty difficult to review a product when I have yet to receive it. The item was ordered 2 weeks ago.
2,too many changes in diet and they single out MEAT as the sole source of the reason,They removed a lot of variables at once and came to the conclusion that one variable (meat) was what was previously causing the health issues.This book will do well with the weak minded and those in needs of fix.
4,VERY important documentary!,"As a wellness practitioner and a chiropractor, I believe nutrition is one of the foundational tenets to a healthy and prosperous life. Forks Over Knives helps reveal the correlation between dietary choices and your health.The documentary highlights The China Study which, in my opinion, needs to be read by anyone who wants a chance at better health.My only gripe with The China Study and Forks Over Knives is that they are heavily biased towards vegetarianism. I don't believe you have to boycott meat to be healthy as long as it's from an organic, free-range, grass fed source (which is both rare and expensive to find.)Well worth the purchase as long as you take it all with a grain of salt"
5,Great Documentary-Lots of good research from past studies!,"I chose this rating cause I absolutely loved their message and delivery. I believe alot of what they are saying and pointing out, but I know that some of the things they do are somewhat extreme...they are still doing them with the best outcome in mind."
5,Health,"I recommend this dvd just for any one who wants to be educated on the foods we eat, and then I recommend this dvd for those who want there Health back."
5,A Convincing Position,Forks Over Knives has convinced my family and many others to reduce or eliminate the excessive animal-based products in our diet. We already feel better and believe there will be long term health benefits in our lives. We saw this at the suggestion of our daughter who had already begun the transition to a less meat and milk dependent diet and who had found it both easy and rewarding.
5,Everyone should see Forks Over Knives,This is a must see movie. Everyone with poor health conditions or have family members or friends with health issues will benefit from seeing this movie. It's a fantastic movie presented by medical doctors.
5,Loved it!,"FOK has changed the way I eat. I used to live to eat, comforting myself with any and everything rich and delicious! Wendy's, KFC were among my favorites. Crispy Cremes, chocolate, cheddar cheese. Never met a carb or fat I didn't like-except beans. Since watching FOK (and re-watching it every other week) I have lost 12 pounds (in 6 weeks) and eat whatever and as much as I want. FOK changed what I want to eat. I'm loving green salads, beans and lentils with brown rice, soy burgers on whole wheat bread for lunch. Fruit, almond milk in my morning coffee. Other foods as well, but all plant based. I have energy, sleep well at night, and am the most positive emotionally in years. I've never been so regular in my life. I may occasionally still eat a little meat (like the chinese do), a smidgeon of goat cheese , or a free range egg here and there. But I no longer purchase them.Thank you Drs. Campbell and Esselstyn!"
4,Good movie,"The video was good quality, and cheap. I only needed the video for a one time viewing so it was nice not having to buy it. The movie was very interesting its a very one sided controversial topic and they do a good job describing their side."
5,Animals are not food,People need to realise that feeding our food to animals so we can eat them is an idea who's time has passed. I think if we used the grain to feed humans versus animals there would be enough food to feed everyone. Learn how a vegan diet can not only save the planet it can save yourself.
4,Insightful,A wonderful documentary about the connection between what we eat and our overall health. A must see for anyone with loved ones who are suffering from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
2,I don't agree,"I don't agree with vegetarianism, except in a few cases a person's body might require that. Read Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions. However, I DO ,wholeheartedly agree with humane treatment of animals and that our main meat supply is senseless, brutal, ugly, and disgusting with regards to how animals are treated. We buy our chicken and animal products from local farmers whenever we can, beef from a ND rancher, etc. Money better spent than on doctors!!"
5,This movie is changing so many lives!,"My 60 y/o Dad watched this movie, switched to a plant-based diet, and in less than 4 months his cholesterol dropped 66 pts. My 64 y/o Uncle watched the movie, switched to a plant-based diet on January 1st, lost 31 lbs, and is now off his high blood pressure medication. My 83 y/o Grandma watched the movie, switched to a plant-based diet, lost 9 lbs in 13 days, her high blood pressure is almost back to normal, and her doctor thinks she will eventually be able to get off ALL 14 of her prescriptions. When/if that happens, the money no longer spent on prescriptions each month will be greatly appreciated since she's retired and lives on a limited income.This movie has had a tremendous effect on our family, to say the least, I highly recommend it!"
5,Doc Review,"This documentary was extremely informational and was put together well. It was entertaining, informative, and thought provoking. I would recommend this video to anyone who is seeking better health."
5,Amazing,All the day to day health problems that we are all facing today.... God has given all of us the foods that we need to help improve our health!
5,A must see for anybody for anyone serious about their health,"A very intellectual and thorough examination of the subject, and it is also done entertainly.The principle speakers and narrators have outstanding credentials and make compelling arguments for their case."
5,very informative,one of the best presentations I have seen on the subject of what we eat and how we prpare it.
5,A must see!,"I think everyone should watch this. Its important information that everyone should be aware of. Everyone should also read the book, The China Study. Its like the companion to the movie but has so much more information. The last half of the book is not covered in the movie and is very interesting."
1,Keep looking,"Frankly, this ""documentary"" is a rather uninteresting rehashing of Campbell's claims in 'the China Study'. These have been thoroughly debunked elsewhere. The case for animal protein as cause of cancer, heart disease, etc. is far less convincing than the case for refined carbs and especially fructose. I've enjoyed enormous success in dieting by focusing on ""good"" carbs, with plenty of fiber, and eliminating all refined sugars and carbohydrates. I have not found it necessary to eliminate, nor even to reduce meat."
5,Forks over Knives is a must see!,"This movie is one of the most important documentaries of our time. With the increasing prevalence of chronic disease in this country, it is time for everyone to see this film and come to the reality of what we are doing to ourselves in addition to what the food industry is doing to bring us to an early and, often, painful death. Don't fail to see this film!"
3,An examination of what present day food is and is doing to us.,"This is a good overall review of modern industrial food growth and processing. It would be interesting to study just how ingrained in our economy these current methods are and how we might change, realistically to a more positive diet."
5,For the Connoiseur of Bad Cinema,"Whether you like bad movies or not, this book is great fun to read. Inspired by the Movieline magazine column of the same name, Bad Movies We Love offers a tour of the worst of many genres, even devoting entire chapters to specific actors. Sharon Stone [Chapter 11: The Stone Age] was a good enough sport to write the Forward.I can't pick this book up without laughing out loud. I keep it on the end table by my sofa within convenient reach of my remote control."
3,"Bad Movies-Know Them,Love Them","""Bad Movies We Love"" is a great how-to guide in finding cheesy/hammy movies. Authors Edward Margulies&Stephen; Rebello classify them in different categories. ""Slay it with music"" deals with Hollywood's worst musicals. ""Bad Movies A Go-Go"" is a treasure trove of psychedelic cheesefests. ""No,but I saw the book"" shows that not every movie based on a novel is automatically good. ""Slip us a Mickey"" is devoted to Mickey Rourke while ""The Stone Age"" is dedicated to Sharon Stone.""Bad Movies We Love"" isn't deep reading. It even takes on ""Valley of the Dolls"",""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Butterfield 8"",the soap opera movie that earned Liz Taylor an Oscar. It's fun reading,and a how-to guide in finding bad movies that are fun watching."
5,Virginia Opera Juliua Caesar,"This is a superb performance, with three counter-tenors singing in lead roles, and Sujung Kim as Cleopatra."
2,froze up on large flow,"This item lasted only a few weeks before I had to replace it. I connected this regulator to a supply hose for a two burner propane stove which I installed on a sailboat. The first time I used both stove tops, all seemed fine until the regulator froze over and literally ""popped"" permanently closed. Maybe it would be fine for smaller demands, but the knob feels and works rather cheaply. In short, this is clearly a case of when less expensive is synonymous to cheap."
5,BOSE 161 BOOK SHELF SPEAKERS,"THESE ARE GREAT, AND WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IF NEEDED. THESE WORK GREAT ALSO ON THE 1 SET OF BOSE SPEAKER STANDS IN ONE MEDIA ROOM. I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER SET THAT I PURCHASED THRU BEST BUY, AND THEY ARE SITTING ON TWO CHERRY END TABLES NEXT TO MEDIA CONSOLE."
1,HAPPY EARS,After considerable research and pricing I have found this product just what I was in need of. Excellent sound production.
5,Bose is boss,"Have been using a pair of these Bose 161 speakers (mounted on the appropriate Bose speaker stands) for years now and they are still going strong. Coupled with a Bose center channel and a pair of Bose 201 speakers the sound is rich and full, especially for the size. Been running them through an older Pioneer VSX-D308 that offers plenty of oomph...with eyes set on an upgrade to a Yamaha 5.1 473...however for now...no speaker concerns but the mounting brackets on the 161 speaker stands are a bit flimsy and need to be retightened from time-to-time."
2,A disappointing small speaker system from Bose,"We bought the Bose 161 as a compact speaker system for a small room to replace a larger, older Bose bookshelf system. We picked the 161 based on the Bose name and our previously positive experience with their products.Unfortunately, the 161 has very poor bass response. The highs and mid-reange are clear, but without the bass end of the sound spectrum, the sound is flat, almost tinny. We returned the product to Bose and got a prompt refund.Not recommended."
5,Be realistic,"I've been a Bose fan forever. They are hard to beat, but like anything you have to be realistic. I have 2 pairs of Bose 701's that cost a thousand dollars each. I also have two pairs of 161's. I have enough sense not to expect the 161's to compare with the big guys. People who buy these and moan about them not measuring up to Bose' reputation, are the same people who would buy a Pinto and complain that it won't pull their mobile home. You get what you pay for, and for what these speakers cost, they're very good speakers."
1,the Truth about Bose,"Bose is the biggest ""mid-range ONLY"" speaker mfr in the world. There is no depth to the music, no bass response, over rated, over priced and simply a waste of money. If you mant a balanced audio sound that has better sound that you can hear (audible); a beginner set would be Denon. Quality audio equipment mfr's make all their equipment to a standard. They do not develop the product for the Marketing Department.Treat you ears to Marton-Logan Speakers!"
3,"Compact, crisp sound but lacking bass.","I purchased these speakers a few months ago to replace the old behemoths that came with a 30 year old Fisher stereo I recently inherited. My LR is cramped for space so selected these instead of 301s because they fit nicely on the mantle and were reasonably priced. Did a lot of comparative listening with the old speakers and am impressed at their crispness and clarity. The only drawback is the near absence of low frequencies. I'm not playing a lot of rock or bass heavy dance music. Rather, mostly using them for classical. Cymbals & strings ring true but hard to pick up the kettle drums and cellos. After a while, you get used to it but will probably buy a subwoofer at some point. Unless you're short on space, these are OK but would recommend the 301 or 501 for a more audiophile experience."
5,Best Value available,"This are great speakers. Bose keeps delivering reasonabably priced products in the market. ALthough I dont think these were meant for music specificly, they work great for sorround speakers and make a great compliment to the Acoustimas 7 system since they can be hooked up directly to the rear and fx channels from my amp.Lot of people rag and complain about Bose but I am very eagered to purchase from them again. Klipsch and Bose are great companies with decently priced equipment."
4,Bose 161's,"Bose continues to impress with these speakers. While a little weak in the bass area as it sounds sort of muffled, that could just very well be the poor quality speaker wires I have. Yet, when I lower the bass, I hear pristine clear quality music. I have not yet hooked up my receiver to my television to hear the sounds of a movie. Being a college student, these are an excellent buy for a speaker upgrade to a sound system, or being added to a work in progress home theater system. The only complaint I have besides the muffled bass is that the speaker wires tend to come out a lot and I have to keep putting them back in. Once again, this could just be the poor quality speaker wires I have. Once I purchase better ones, I will update my review as to whether the bass is improved or not. Overall, a very good speaker, but until I purchase the new speaker wires, I cannot upgrade the quality of the Bose 161's."
2,Cheap even for cheap price,"I bought these to go with a Sonos amplifier for my system at home. The room is fairly small, but the sound is so thin that i couldn't keep them and had to send them back.They're probably fine as an addition to an overall system, but as primary speakers (even if just shelf speakers) it's worth spending $100 more as you'll get a bunch more for your money.Or, just buy a Play 3."
4,good for bose,"Not the biggest fan of bose generally I think the motto is great sound through marketing, they market themselves as the best of the best sometimes when there are far better speakers out there. Upon receiving them I was surprised on the clarity and ability to produce reasonable lows when needed granted there not going to sound like they have a sub with them but overall sounded very nice. I think the mounting brackets were very nice and easy to make little adjustments with them , Overall very pleased with how they sound and If needed would buy again."
4,Great for what they are,"I think these are great speakers considering their size and they are a very good value for the price. I've been putting together a fairly complex sound system in a large house and used the 161's for a tight enclosure space that yet had to work in a much larger room than they were ever intended for. The result was that I've gotten a second pair. I wasn't expecting much in the way of low end performance yet these are decent and the rest of the range is impressive. My only issue is the mounting system is chintzy, and I found the speakers slipping down from their own weight. A trip to the hardware store was required which is no huge deal but then again, come on Bose, you cheaped out on the mounts. Just IMO for what it's worth."
3,Adequate for a Small Space,"We puchased these speakers to place inside a cabinet in our new apartment, which they do fine. The sound is not nearly as good as that from our old standard size Cambridege speakers."
5,I need help. not your fault,I fully except these speaker to be wonderful as soon as I can have them connected properly. I am an old lady and have not been successful on my own.
2,Not Impressed,"After listening to many speakers back to back while I was sampling what units I would like to try out, I listened to the 161's. I have to say they were the worst sounding speakers in the place."
3,beautiful speakers,"Beautifully designed speakers but we orderd them thinking we could directly hook up to what we have-nope. Unfortunantly we decided to return them. Vanns was wonderful for the return,shipping and everything.Thanks."
2,This is a $20 speaker,"These were installed in the theater room of my new house. I am pretty into stereo gear, and I have points of comparison.You can hear the cabinents vibrate. They are made of cheap plastic and weigh very little. They sound like the speakers that come in your cheap TV.The only reason that I wrote this review is because people are spending so much money on them. It is just not right. If you like these speakers, do a little research and find something in the $20 price area that sounds the same and save money."
1,"Just plain bad, even for Bose","I watched Spiderm-man on a Bose set of speakers in 5.1. This consisted of the vsc-10 center, bose towers (i dont remember the model number, but its the one with the tweeter that point the wrong way and woofers in the backside), and these Bose 161 for surrounds.The sound coming from the center speaker and these speakers was so unbearable at high volumes, that me and my friend agreed it would be best to turn them off and just watch the movie in stereo. They both sounded very muddy and resonance comming off the plastic construction was quite annoyting. Theyre both cheap feeling in construction and i would not be surprised if they both used the same woofers inside (the center and these).When you are buying these speaker, you are basically buying from the bottom of the barrel of what Bose has to offer, which is really bad, considering how mediocre their more expensive offerings sound."
1,Deceived,I am very deceived about those speakers which givre me the impression that they are fake. I was expecting great sound from the magic name BOSE. they should be out of the market as such. The wiring os obsolete and they are not digital and cannot worl without a receiver with my tv.I have the feeling of being cheated and let down by m'y purchase.
2,Not for the everyday user....,"First, I was perturbed that the unit came without any connecting cords to the amplifier/TV source, and I had to go out and buy my own. Secondly, white looked like it stuck out too much. I returned the unit. I'm sure it would've been a super sounding unit, however, there must be easier paths to traverse. [...]"
5,A realistic look at organized crime,"Charlie Stella writes like he has more insight intothis dark world than a ""good man"" should.Fabulous dialogue.Page to page action.Full of plot twists and double crosses.A fitting follow-up to ""Charlie Opera""This is his best book so far."
3,"well-written, but characters unsympathetic","The main character, Yin Ling, was very unsympathetic as were her husband, Vincent, and lover, Ben Gallagher. I thought she was weak and whiny. Ah Heng Cheh and her god are fascinating-best part of the book. The book did keep me reading 'til the end-I kept hoping it would get better. The fire at the end of the book left me with some questions-was Vincent responsible? The book doesn't clearly say."
1,Dear Ms. Argerich!!!!,"WOW! Ooooops!! What a flop! Why would a great pianist like Martha Argerich present a mediocrity like Mr. Mogilevsky?The boy is a regular, average piano student with typical unpolished 'russian' piano playing, has neither musical ideas nor much understanding of the material at hand, be it Schumann, Brahms or Prokofiev. Prokofiev fares a bit better than German classics, but still far from satisfactory even on a student level.....what is the point of 'presenting' such flashy and musically trashy performances?"
3,Beware of compatibility issues,"I bought this adapter because it seemed to have every profile and features you could wish for, but is not all that compatible.To my disappointment I found out that it will only connect with devices that comply with the SMCS-T copyright protection format, so my brand new Anycom Headset (Mod. BSH-100) won't work.I just wish that the people that work with the Bluetooth system avoid having so many standards and protocols.I'll end up buying an older version of a Bluetooth adaptor (V1.2 instead of V.2) from the same manufacturer (Anycom) to ensure compatibility.This makes no sense for a technology that intends to be the universal standard for wireless devices."
3,A good mix of hip/hop and r+b,"This Cd was pretty good overall. Even though I think Babyface did a better job on the soul food soundtrack, this one is worth listening. Three good reasons to buy this cd are the track by swv, faith evans, and (#1!!!) the track buy coko, jon b. and jay-z. That is the best track on this CD."
5,Fantastic and intriguing,"This book follows one family and their unique twists of fate. A woman who has three children by different man, but in love with her husband, a man so obsessed with his title and home, that he will do anything to protect it..... Rich and privileged, but all haunted by some unhappiness. A really good, if not long, book. I really enjoyed ""Wicked Pleasures"" and I'll be back for more Penny Vincenzi books."
4,enjoyed this book,"I was so tired of badly written ( 50 shades) , boring books that I hunkered down and pretty much enjoyed every page. This author is a favorite and most of her books have been very enjoyable reading.I carried it around, got involved with the characters and was sad to see it end."
4,"Detailed history of breed, special emphasis on police work","As a new and first time owner of a Bouvier des Flandres puppy, I appreciated many of the details, historical, raising and breeding. The book emphasizes the Bouvier as a Schultzhund dog, which is the author's perogative. I would have appreciated more information on training of a Bouvier for a pet. Many dog owners desire a lovable pet not a champion police dog. The author is an important breeder of Bouviers and he has many valid points to keep the Bouviers to a standard. I myself researched breeders for several months as it is a problem. My summary statement is that the book is worth the money. If there is a revision, I hope the author will broaden his interests in the breed for the general dog owner."
5,"Engel, Bouvier des Flandres, ""The Dogs of Flandres Fields""",The Engel book is the ultimate reference book for all serious Bouvier des Flandres owners! I recommend it highly and look forward to up-coming books by the author!
3,It's okay,"Bought used in ""good"" condition. Kind of dated but hope new addition comes out soon. Packaging was good. Some yellowing of pages around the edges from age I assume. No torn or folded pages. Book seems to be very indepth, it's a gift so not reading deeply into it."
3,Not as advertised,"I purchased this book advertised as ""like new"". Although it was in fairly good condition it was definately not like new. Almost 1/2 of the book and the back cover were stained and pages wrinkled as if something had been spilled on it. I realize it was cheaper than buying it new but it was not in the condition as advertised. I would think twice about buying from this vendor again."
4,Good for school teachers,"This story lends itself to classroom instruction with it's captivating story. It implores readers to think about their place in the world. The illustrations are almost 3-D, and are a nice change from more typical children's illustrations. I really enjoyed sharing this story with my students."
3,Just So-so,"I needed a macro lens and thought I could save some money. That was my primary reason for buying this particular lens. But I'm kind of disappointed in it. Mine seems very noisy and slow focusing. And, while now I finally have macro capability, the overall quality is just so-so.I have only used it one afternoon, for about an hour shooting flowers in the back yard. Maybe my pictures will improve. I'm sure some of the problem is my unprofessional technique, but I'm also thinking that I might have had more fun with a better lens than this one. There's no substitute for good quality, and this lens' quality isn't the best."
3,Nice lense for a nice price,"This is a great lense, with caveats.I prefer it to the nifty 50 since you can do everything the nifty can and get much closer to the subject.When you have focus dead-on, it just can't be beat (except by a better L macro lense).But, like another poster had commented, it grabs the wrong focus point at times.I find that anything lower than 4.5 simply delivers a fuzzy picture. Above 4.5 it is sharp as heck.I'm looking forward to upgrading to the new EF 100mm IS macro soon. But I'll keep this little gem."
5,"You can't beat this ""macro"" lens for the money","Being that it isn't really a true macro lens (it does not give you true 1:1 without an added and very expensive extender piece), it does a wonderful job on closeups. With the 2.5 aperture, the lens provides great depth of field and come beautiful bokah normally seen in Canon's awesome L-Series lenses. If you don't want to ante up nearly $1000 for the aforementioned L-Series lens, this is definitely the lens for you."
4,"Krause is awsome, Mojica recordings a waste of you have othe","The Mojica recordings on this CD are the same ones found on his album ""Historia de Exitos."" Orfeon has a habit of recycling recording.However, I was not familiar with Alfredo Krause. His Grandada and Estrellita are awsome."
5,A great read...but not long enough!!!,"As soon as I picked up this book and started reading, I was hooked in about 5 minutes. There are really three stories going on here. The authors search for his unsuccessful rodeo bum of a father that left him as a kid, a history of many different rodeos, and the authors experience attending these rodeos. This is really a well written and entertaining book!!! The stories move along really well, and keep you from putting the book down. My only complaint is that it wasnt longer. But then again, maybe that was a plus, as there really wasnt any lulls in the story. Highly recommend!"
5,Great reporting,"To say that Chasing the Rodeo is a mere primer on the rodeo circuit is like saying The Sun Also Rises is about bullfighting. This is a great read, fully charged with emotion and old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting. Kip Stratton tells us how the weather was and much, much more. Bravo!"
2,Dissapointing,"For the reader desiring to learn about Rodeo, this book is a waste of time. For the Rodeo fan or participant, this book will be a dissapointment. Numerous factual errors and obvious observational misunderstandings make it clear that the author made little attempt at research and aside from a perfunctory interview with Jesse Bail, had no "" inside "" access."
5,Great Macedonija,Do not call me FYROM Call them Former Macedonian Republic Greece..... I do not appriciate any and not will accept any coments on this review. You can write what you want but will be wind in mountain.Thank you for reading this.Makedonija Forewer
5,Quite A Find!,"As electronic excursions go, this album is a rare find, one of the best blances of frenetic beats and jazzy grooves out right now. I heard these guys by chance, just passing by someone who was listening to it, and liked it so much I bought it. Haven't stopped listening to it since. Each song seems meticulously thought out and evolve in their own space here, just a really accomplished electronic effort. Who are these guys? Where did Org come from? I have no idea, but I wanna go there whereever it is. Buy this disc!"
4,Pretty Good Chillout Comp.,"Coming from a picky music listener, I enjoyed this cd. The songs here were definitely chillout but upbeat at the same time so its appropriate enough to drive to and relax with. However, I gave it 4 stars because some of the songs (The Remedy,Smooth, & Parabormal Synthesis) had potential of being great songs but were ruined with lyrics that didn't go with the track. Best track hands down is ""Parabormal Synthesis"""
3,Nice listen,Nice listen for the electronica music fan. Downtempo and smooth electronica. Came across this CD on Pandora radio and bought it the next day. Good album to add to your collection.
1,Very Low Quality,"These are not the York Peppermint Patties that I am accustomed to. They are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients. After I took a single bite I could tell something was wrong, so I checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in Mexico (I saw on another variety here on Amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the 'Made in Mexico' York Peppermint Patties). This product is a waste of money."
3,This world no longer exists,"This book goes back to 1959 and as such, it describes a world that no longer exists, particularly since so much of the author's travels are centered around colonial forts, administrative centers and the like when Europeans were in de-facto control of this remote part of Sahara. It is a fascinating look, though, of the last days of France's colonial presence in Chad and provides a window into the world of French outposts in some of the world's most God-forsake corners.There's not too much attempt to understand local peoples or cultures, although he does go into the geography, geology and archaelogy to a certain extent. One feels that this white man preferred the world of other white men when encountering this part of Saharan Africa."
5,This CD will ROCK your world,This band is full of crazy punk energy! Anyone who is serious about punk MUST have this CD in their library.
1,Don't even think about it!!,"This is NOT a shawm...it's a crappy reproduction of a baroque oboe. If you want REAL shawms, contact Bob Cronin in Menlo Park California (Google him). AND, you would only pay about $1,000 for a top of the line Soprano shawm from him...he's one of the best makers in the world...Moeck sucks bigtime!!"

5,Amazing,"This cd is, just amazing. Thats the only way to describe this. It's a masterpiece. I was never really a fan of Randy's music before, but this cd has everything. Every single song is different, but has that old school rock influence/feel. There's a song for everyone here. Some of the best cuts are ""I Don't Need Love"", ""Karl Marx and History"", ""Addicts of Communication"", and ""Punk Rock City""."
5,Great album,"Another great album by this great punk band. Following The rest is silence and Can't keep a good band down, Randy continues to bring us great material. Every song has something special, like every song Randy has done in the past."
3,"Great Campy horror flix, but it ain't ""Gone With The Wind""","While looking into movies that I loved as a kid I ran across this one that I first saw on late night cable just after we got it. I really enjoyed it then and now but it's NOT THAT GREAT!Professor(Richard Crenna) takes students to house and IT'S HAUNTED!!!While it does entertain, It's in a campy way, not as a great horror movie. I'm a lover of the old T.V. horror movies, so you know that graphic gore isn't what I look for. This one has a story line that is filled with every cliche of the ""Haunted House"" genre and it goes step by step through every one of them. like I said it's fun , But ""Gone With The Wind"" it ain't!"
4,The Evil,"The movie is wasted only by scenes of people sliding around and people getting killed by electric shocks. There isn't enough to qualify this as spine-tingling fun. It is also laughably dated in visual material! Try to watch that sick girl shake all over the floor in her undies for a change and you'll see why! The only exception would be Andrew Prine sinking in mud and attempting to commit suicide.At first, I was expecting a shrieky classic haunted house spook show, but that wasn't it. Granted, THE EVIL suffers from a serious lack of diversity. You know a movie that has a conflicting situation between good and evil, and the end always turns out to be quite simple. Any low-budget horror movie can do A LOT better than this, but for the moment, give THE EVIL some extra credit for its dark and thunderous setting that lives up to my expectations. This one spoils the most hardcore horror fans for not being frightening enough."
5,excellent,"this cd is excellent, i like yousuf's song, ""do you mind if i play"" the most, i really love it and can't seem to get enough.r.martin is pretty cool too, all the songs in this cd are diffrent and yet relate to soccer, so if you like soccer, this cd is for you, and even if you don't like soccer, if you appreciate good music, listen to this cd."
4,Really good Cd. A must for (european) football lovers.,"This is one of the best world cups yet. and what could be better than having an amazing set of music to go along. I am an avid fan of football and its chants, songs and music and by far this enters my top ten of music so far. Head my recommendation, by this cd!"
4,Premium Quick Change Hitch - minor caveats,"Attachment and assembly instructions easy to read and follow, and performance has been as expected with a couple of minor caveats. The lower pins on your attachments MUST be free of obstructions externally to work effectively. Additionally be advised that the Change Hitch extends about 2-3"" more than your original 'traditional' lower arms which may require a longer top hitch bar. Also draw bars that would attach to your lower arms and use a lower arm stop (as opposed to a top draw pivot lock assembly may not work, since there is nothing to 'lock' the draw bar against. This is not a product that you want to regularly attach and remove as it can take about 30 minutes each time you go to re-attach. Overall however it saves me 10-30 minutes per attachment change out. If you do not have factory original quick hitch assemblies on your lower arms, this is well worth the investment."
1,doesn't seem to work,"I have been taking Sytrinol for over two months and tested my cholesterol a few days ago. I was expecting a 20-30% reduction, but instead my cholesterol reading was much higher. I took the test twice more to make sure and it came out the same. I have not otherwise changed my diet in this time, so my conclusion is that Sytrinol most likely does not work at all. It looks like a con."
4,Coming Out Of Nowhere,"To promote her second album of hits, Gloria Estefan issued a brand new track, a blazing new disco pop track called ""Out Of Nowhere"". She released the commercial single in two different flavors - a two track single and a remix coated maxi-single. This two track features the songs radio friendly edit and a Spanish language track from her ""Alma Caribena"" entitled ""Por Un Beso"". Both tracks are nice tunes from Ms. Estefan, but I have a feeling I would enjoy the remix collection over this simple single release."
2,Disjointed,"The whole book has a kind of disjoined feel to it. The earlier chapters are about mainly biology and evolution. It's kind of familiar territory and seemed a bit dated. The middle chapters were about linguistic, which were pretty interesting. After the end, the book seemed to lose what focus it had.The presentation is chopped up into small sections that don't always flow well (hence, the disjointed feel). It was frustrating to read and felt simplistic at times (as if the reader cannot keep up with an extensive analysis or something).TGHD is not terrible, but I've read better books on the subject.Not recommended."
1,Academic drool,"This book is a good cure for insomnia. It was too heavy on charts and graphs, and too light on interesting research on intercultural connections, as observed in today's world."
5,I learned and was encouraged,"I love this book. Not only did it explain scientific concepts in a way that a non-scientific layman like me can understand, but that it enriched human history with many other disciplines holistically, as it should. Most of all, I was touched by how humanistic the conclusions drawn by this book are. It's really encouraging to know that the progress of science can provide hope to humanity. Thanks so much, professor Sforza."
5,good account of human history,"Great Huaman Diaspporas covers the history of humanity from its origins in Africa and how it spread through different parts of the world. It goes into homo saphiens forefathers and how homo saphiens forefathers evolved into modern man. It also deals with how gene environments influenced genes. It also deals with how language language and race developed.Overall, a account of how humanity developed it in terms of genes, race and langage."
4,Late evolution of mankind - the big journey,"Although there are parts of this book the professional specialist might argue with, this book must be considered as a whole, and as such a whole, it gives the story how modern humans colonized the Earth, splitting off into the various racial and other groups that we find today. A worthwhile book to anyone interested in this part of mankind's evolution."
5,Amazing!,"Save the bucks and don't bother for the IS or IS II. This lens is so fast that you won't need a tripod or monopod 90% of the time. The color, contrast, sharpness are just second to none. I've had many other 2.8 quality lenses including Canon and Nikon and nothing even comes close to it. Take my word. If you spend $1,300 today (by the way it is a steal) and sell it 3 years later you'll get a $1,000 back. That is the beauty about owning quality equipment and keeping them in good shape."
5,Not much to say but PERFECT right?,"This lens is awesome and does exactly what I need it to do. Of course it's heavy, but I knew that going in."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I definetely got a lemon, just got done spending hard earned money to ship it back. I expected much better from ""Professional"" L quality glass. The colors were outstanding, the lens functions were superb, but the pics were coming out blurry, even mounted on a tripod using a remote switch. Took several pics using both manual focus and auto focus, tried different focal lengths, etc, even took my UV filter off. My cheap Quantaray lens performs 10x better. I can't believe I got a bad product from Canon. Now I wonder if I should gamble and try a different L series lens, maybe I just got a dud. I am sorry, I can NOT give this product a good review."
4,Enjoyable,I haven;t had alot of time just yet to use this lense. But everyone says that it is the best. I wanted it for sport pictures this summer at the ball park . Maybe I can give a better review after I really get started using it more.
5,Necessary,"If you are serious about photography, this is one of two or three lenses to own. The 24-70 and a wide angle, 16-35 or 17-40 are part of it. By far and large, this lense is on my camera 65% of the time, whether I'm doing portraits, events, or anything else.I dropped it, along with my camera, and it shattered, brok the lense, broke the motors, and everything to go along...$500 later, I got a brand new one (well, they said they just put new motors and glass, but the whole thing looks brand new to me). Get and keep insurance on your equipments, it's worth it, don't learn your lesson the hard way."
5,Another Great Canon Lens,"Great product once again from Canon.Pros:The ultrasonic motor is quick and focuses very well.Shallow Depth of field is amazingNone of the lens protrudes when zooming inIncluded tripod mount ring, hood and case is of high quality.Cons:PriceWeightOther Thoughts:With this low of an aperature, you can afford to drop the f/4 IS and go for the f/2.8!"
5,canon 2.8 70-200,"Rented this lens before purchase and knew it was exactly right for my photo needs. I've used it to shoot conventions and weddings mostly The results are wonderful; clear, crisp, and professional. I couldn't use a tripod for most of the shots, had absolutely no problem with focus and clarity (bought the 2.8). One unexpected outcome, walking around a wedding with the lens on my Canon let everyone know I was the hired photographer. Nice to have so much respect from a lens. Highly recommended the lens."
5,"Excellent, but Watch out whit the filter Diameter","This lens is outstanding, it has a very solid and strong construction. Any thing i could say may be redundant, my only advice is that the filter Diameter must be 77MM not 67mm like amazon's says."
4,"Excellent comp, but back to mono!","Both the well-known and little-heard efforts of the Greenwich-Barry collaborations are here and it's a must-own for 60s girl group collectors. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't at all care for the stereo mixes; most of these tracks were never meant to be heard in this fashion. The immediacy and impact of the mono mixes is far superior to my ears, so I've docked the review one star for messing with perfection!"
4,It's good,"For those people who love the old girl groups, this CD is a must. It has 25 songs from some of the girl groups from long ago. We love it. I listen to it nearly everyday since receiving it. It's great!"
2,NOT a new version of the Dreamgirls accompaniment,"I ordered this (at quite a cost) hoping that this would be the new orchestration that is currently in the Dreamgirls movie--or at least a more current version than the original. But, alas, no cigar!"
5,Great American Symphonic Music,"I really enjoyed this CD set, and commend the New Zealand Symphony for recording it - it is beautiful music by a great composer who deserves to be better known. Randall Thompson is mainly known for his choral music, but was also active in the instrumental field, as proven here. I especially like the Second Symphony, with its abundance of beautiful melodies.Highly recommended!"
1,JUNK,"I purchased this for my son last Christmas but not for the outrageous price amazon is asking, I purchased mine for just [...] at [...] and my friend also purchased two for her twins. All three children got board with it very quickly and the toys did not last very long. Not long after they got them the motorcycle started getting stuckDo not waste your money on this cheaply made and boring toy"
4,Poof!,"I like this book but then again i don't. The reason why i like it is because of the way that Selena just wanted to see how everything was happening instead of minding her busniess. i am just like Selena. I am always nebby. I vdon't like thebook because i think Noah's mom shouldn't of been allergic to rabbits. Instead of school, i think Noah should have hid them somewhere else, like the library or in his garage. Somewhere his mom wouldn't go or look. I would tell a friend about this book. I think that this relates to text to text because i have read a book just like this one. I forget the name of it though."
1,Unbelievably boring!!,"I picked this up at a library book sale based on the title. I thought even if I don't like the story I love recipes. Very few of the recipes were even real.The main character whined and complained the whole book about how overweight and sloppy she was and about how she couldn't find a good man or any man at all. The problem was that she never did anything to fix her life. I don't see how we as readers are supposed to like her when she doesn't even seem to to like herself all that much.There was no plot, no advancement in the story. I had to force myself to finish reading it."
2,Kind of tiresome....,"Some elements of this book capture what goes through the heads of many women. But Gabby's ceaseless complaining grows tiresome. There are a few (very few) moments of humor. The book wasn't *terrible*, it does address what some women may perceive as real problems in their life (e.g., being ""invisible"" when they are heavy and becoming noticeable when they've lost weight), but NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS in the book. Basically, it's Gabby talking about her neighbor, or her dirty house, or complaining about how she's too fat, the world is too polluted, and all the good men have disappeared. OK, I have days like that too, but I pull out of it and go on with my life. I think a lot of people will be able to *relate* to the book, but it's really not a book that will help you improve your state in life or understand human nature better (unless you are totally clueless about how a single woman with a weight problem WOULD feel...)"
2,What A Bummer,This book left much to be desired. I wound up hating the main character when I knew I was supposed to find her amusing. Pass on this one.
1,Disappointing,"I wanted so much to like this book, but was quite disappointed. It sounded like it had everything I usually like in a novel. Instead, the story seemed very aimless. I love quirky characters, but quirkiness in the extreme equates to unbelievability. I couldn't relate to Gabby at all. And the supposed humor was completely lost on me."
3,CONFUSED!!!,"I liked the idea of this book and it made me laugh A LOT. However, it left me confused and wondering what the point was most of the time. Made me appreciate my companion though. I was disappointed as well that the recipes weren't real. I love books with recipes and this was a major disappointment that I wasn't even getting any good recipes! I felt disgusted with Gabby at times being so lazy and untidy. I don't understand her relationship with Hester or anyone else. Would check out another book written by this author but wouldn't be running out to buy it!"
1,Botulism Stew,"Recipes from the Dump is incredibly dull. Even the character says so herself:""I am waiting...waiting for a fella""And God knows how boring a woman can be when she does nothing but sit around her house next to the dump and wait.I'm taking my copy of the book ... and sending it to where it belongs...the dump! I can only hope it's the dump next to Gabby's home where she'll pick it up and read how boring she is and make a move to do something...anything!"
2,I don't know how I feel about this book...,"I really wanted to like this book - but I never really connected with any of the characters. Gabby is a single mother of three, always on the lookout for love, she's a good neighbor, and happens to live next to the town dump. The recipes that Abigail Stone inserted were hysterical, and very appropriate to the story. There wasn't any good dialogue, and now that I'm done, I still feel like I'm waiting for something, anything, to happen."
1,How did this book get published?,I rarely find a book where I can't get interested in either the character or the story. But I am sad to say this book was neither interesting nor compelling.
1,Mini Rapid Charger,"As far as charging up the battery it does a great job. However, you can't get the battery out once you've gotten it charged. I almost sent it back but didn't want to lose my battery since I couldn't get it out of the charger. I finally used a very thin screw driver to pry it out of the charger. I just have to make sure I have a tool to remove the battery."
1,Yomega Has Become KING of Cheap Trash,"Bought this Kendama for my son. Liked the fact it was from Yomega, which made good quality toys when they started. WRONG!!! My son played with it less than an hour when it broke where the handle meets the cups. From other reviews I've read, this seems common enough to be classified as a design flaw, or a flaw that occurs in the molding process during manufacturing the toy. Either way, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY!!!! Buy one made of wood or bamboo. They will certainly be more durable."
5,fun eye hand coordination toy,"Hello~ I have seen several Kendamas and they are all made of wood. This one is durable plastic and works as well as the wooden ones, if not better. I am glad that I chose this one."
1,One star is because I received the items,"I ordered two items, one green and one yellow. Was supposed to be two day shipping but took almost a week to arrive. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I will not order from this vendor again. It is to close to Christmas to return the items and my children would be disappointed if they open presents on Christmas to find they didn't receive the one item they asked for.Thank you and happy holidays"
2,Get a wood version,My son played with this for only a few days before asking for a wood kendama instead. This one is plastic and the ball bounces too much off the cups making it really hard to catch. The wood one is now the only one he uses. I would stay away from the plastic ones.
2,Ok,Well its not as good as wooden so its nearly impossible to spike but cups are easy to get on so get wooden not plastic plus it breaks in a couple days
1,Fine product but not a standard Kendama,"My son picked this out thinking it was the kind made of wood that seems to be the standard Kendama; this one is made wholly of molded plastic. It does not have the same 'action' as the wood kind. It is an otherwise fine, quality product."
5,RE KENDAMA,We bought this for my 11 yr old nephew..and he absolutely LOVES it! he's getting better and better each day with it. I highly suggest you get one for your child/granchild/niece/nephew etc..if they like challenging toys
5,kendama,"this is a very good toy and durable. it is a little harder to use than the wood ones, but it works well."
3,Why did Cathy go back to her company???,"I read something on the Net that said: now that Cathy's been downsized, she should go back to college and train for a new field! I thought that was a great idea and so was disappointed when she went back to her company. I also think she should get Irving out of her life as he's obviously not going to change at all. As well, what happened to Andrea, Cathy's feminist friend? She used to be so cool and reasonable and now when we do see her she's this harassed mother with two monster kids and a boring job."
4,Love it!,"A great little book that's not too long, not too short. The illustrations are adorable and the story is heartfelt without being too cheesy. Highly recommended!"
4,My daughter loves this book!!!,"My daughter doesn't live close to either of her grandmothers, so it's always a special occasion when they visit. This book and family photos help my little girl (almost 2) remember her Grandmas.The only critique I have is that I wish there were multiple editions of the book, where the child is a boy, or different ethnicities were represented. But looking at the list of Ms. Katz's titles, I can see her plate is full enough as it is!!!!"
4,A Good Book,"This is a typical Katz book, beautiful pictures, cute words in large print, and a lift the flap format. Your baby/infant will be captivated and reach for this book often.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me, is because I expected Karen Katz to include a more youthful looking grandma. Times have changed...neither of my children's grandmothers nor those of any of our friends look this way anymore...I just expected the images to reflect that I guess."
3,Gender of Child Important to Know Before Buying,"Nice book, but I wish I had known from the review that the story was unequivocally about a girl... I had bought it for my mom for Christmas, but it's not at all appropriate, since I have a baby son. I would have liked that information to appear in Amazon's review."
3,A little overpriced!,"It's a nice little picture book for toddlers, but very short and slightly overpriced for what you get."
2,Shame on Rudy Pérez,"The other day I heard a song on the radio, and said to myself ""this sounds really familiar...."" Well the song was ""Te tengo que aprender a olvidar"". I know and love it by Mia. Well Rudy Pérez has recycled the exact same song only substituted Betzaida's less than stellar vocals (no offense hon', but compared to Mia...). That's not all, the album itself recycles 5 songs from Mia's album TENTACION. What gives Rudy? Are you that lazy? This actually isn't the first time I know of him doing this. He recycled the song ""Come As You Are"" that was originaly recorded by the trio Wild Orchid for their sophmore release OXYGEN and it was later re-recorded by Jaci Velásquez for her album CRYSTAL CLEAR. Hmmm...all I can say is I feel sorry for the acts that are recording recyclced songs. I bet half of them didn't even know it.Be a little more selective w/ whom you work w/ on your next release. I'd hate to see you singing rehashed songs again."
1,Definitely not Celine Dion,"This albums is basically recycled from a CD released exactly one year ago (2003) by another singer MIA, who coincidentally also is signed to Univision Records. Why they did this, I am not sure. Perhaps they didn't have any originality saved for this little girl? 5 of these songs were sung by Mia, even Betzaida's debut single ""Te Tengo Que Aprender A Olvidar""! i mean, ouch! talk about an embarrassment!!!! If you're interested in hearing a real diva, take a listen to the aforementioned Mia. She has a voice comparable to Toni Braxton and some fun pop/tropical songs that will keep u dancing and singing!Betzaida has alot to learn as a singer. It's understandable, but they should have really prepared her for a proper debut album, instead of this seemingly unorganized and material rehashed effort. Shame!"
1,not what I expected,"This is a badly written book, therefore the examples in it sound as if they were prefabricated. I mean all the examples the author gives follow one simple order;1- the patient came to me2- they had difficulty conceiving for years3- I contacted the spirit baby4- spirit baby had a message for the birth parent5- I conveyed that msg to the parent6- the parent made the necessary adjustments in their lives based on that msg7- after this they conceived a baby easilyThe book is nothing but countless examples of this order, over and over again. I stopped reading at page 140 or so. It was a waste of my time!"
4,eccletic,"This book helps to build a bit of comfort and understanding while struggling with infertility. It removes the fear of blame and guilt resulting from miscarriages and is encouraging so that faith in God is increased resulting in His fulfillment of promise to carry a baby to full term which ultimately enables our dreams to come into fruition of becoming the parents we choose to be. You need to believe in reincarnation with this author's given ability. You also need to be open to some ritualistic chants in calling your spirit baby. Although I'm not quite into either of these approaches, I still found a fun chant that can be done anywhere, anytime, and in any way through a familiar tune. Doing so, has already allowed me to see visions of my future success;having my first born come to life."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"This book was quiet a bit different than what I had expected. I am not much of a believer in clairvoyants and I do think that the author spent too much time on his experiences realizing he could contact the spirit world. I did find it an interesting take on fertility issues and miscarriage and I am glad that I read the book. Not for everyone, but if you are a believer in the spirit world and mediums this could be the book for you."
5,A Must for Parents and those wishing to be Parents.,"Touching book about conceiving and the messages and lessons our children-to-be have for each of us. A gem of a book filled with wonderful stories that make you realize there is so much more to being born and coming into the world. What a gift to read and share. Great insight into abortion, adoption, pregnancy and fertility issues."
5,Old school and hard core,"After going through countless electric and gas stick edgers, I broke down and bought one of these. Anyone that has issues with it just needs to remember that a little grease goes a long way. I can't tell you how easy it is to use this thing; I have a large corner lot with a curb strip, so it used to take me close to an hour to edge the grass with a string trimmer, and it was never straight. On top of that, it would use up most of the reel being ground down on the concrete, and constantly get clogged with grass and mud.I just did my entire yard in 5 minutes. Piece of cake. This thing will probably belong to my son one day. Don't waste money buying hardware store edgers from Lowes and Home Depot. You'll go through 6 or 7 of them over the life of one of these."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This is a low resolution camera. Even at 10 feet away you couldn't get a good enough picture of an intruders face to ID them. Another problem is that the system operates at 2.4GHZ like so many wireless devices today and even after I turned everything off in my house that uses the same frequency the picture kept flashing with lots of lines in it. This was at a distance of about 20 feet from the receiver. So apparently my neighbors wireless devices were interfering with the cameras signal. I called Q See about these issues and they told me that most people have to use a wired camera.
2,Disappointed with quality,I don't recommend this. The quality is poor. The wireless signal is poor and the picture is full of lines. The cable that came with it did not work so I had to replace it in order to get it to work in the first place. I would look for a different brand.
1,Sucks,"Bought this camera for my mom and dad who live in a high-crime area of town. It lasted about 6 months then ""poof"" it quit."
5,Elton John Rebirth,"This is a very exquisite album. You can hear the maturity of Elton's voice as compared to his earlier works. This album helps to develop what we see from him in his future albums. He is a world class artist, and this album displays his fantastic singing voice. The song Healing Hands is the voice we all know, but in Stones throw from Hurtin, he displays his ability to change. This is truly an album for those who can respaect what Elton has done to change the music industry."
4,"Overproduced, but great songs","My major gripe with ""Sleeping with the Past"" is that it has that awful, synthetic ""late '80s"" production aesthetic about it. Imagine how ""Sacrifice"" could have sounded had it been done instead with Elton on a real piano and some brushed drums or something in the background. But anyway, the songs themselves are very fine. ""Durban Deep,"" ""Club at the End of the Street,"" ""Sacrifice,"" ""Blue Avenue""...all outstanding tracks. Bernie Taupin turns in a sharp set of lyrics, as well. Overall, one of Elton's better albums (and perhaps his best in the '80s) with an interesting attempt to conjure up the spirits of '60s soul and R&B records."
4,One of his best,"This album is one of his finest (considering he was almost dead from drug and alcohol abuse at the time he recorded it, its also a minor miracle it came out at all)The production is top notch, the lyrics and songwriting are slick and well-produced.Taupin was at top lyrical form here, with several clever and heart-warming words to go with the music. SWTP has a techno-club type sound to it that I think is excellent. Healing Hands, Sacrifice, Blue Avenue, Durban Deep, they're all good. There are no weak tracks on this one, IMO. This is one of the very few that I can listen to start to finish and enjoy every moment. Pick this one up ASAP if you havent yet."
5,NIce fins,"These are nice fins. Comfortable to use in the water, gives more propulsion than Zoomers but less than a scuba diving fin. Sizing seems to be true to size. I usually wear a size 11 shoe, and according to the size chart I ordered an XL. They are a good snug fit with no slipping at the heel."
1,Not Game of Thrones,Didn't like it. Much like some of his earlier work. Now very well written. Prefer the Game of Thrones series. Shows maturity as a writer.
5,Far better than his other works,"I must confess I wasn't a huge fan of his SoIF series. Tuf Voyaging however, was something else entirely. From the very beginning I found the character of Tuf himself, about which the novel centers, to be utterly fascinating. George R.R. Martin has managed to create something I once thought impossible, a new archetype. I truly have never encountered another character like him in all my years. Fans of witty dialogue and hifalutin language will surely fall in love.This is a standalone collection and should in no way be compared or even related to his other works."
3,Tuf voyaging,"People may be given the tools to solve their tough problems, but there's a choice whether to use said tools and to be accountable for consequences."
4,Surprisingly good,"I don't normally read sci-fi but I was curious to see what George Martin would do. I was pleasantly surprised, especially after the disappointment of ""A Feast for Crows."" Tuf is an amusing character and the book has a touch of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" to it. Well done."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"You won't walk away feeling any smarter after reading this book, but you will walk away with a smile. Colorful characters and imaginative places along with a lovable main character make this a pleasure to read. If you like witty dry humor, and interesting Sci-Fi you will enjoy this book. This is nothing like Martin's other books and it is breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great songs!,"Online friends told me about k's choice. I'm glad they did. The harmonies are wonderful, the tunes stay in your head...I was humming all the songs from this CD all summer. I saw k's choice perform in Philadelphia. Perhaps they're not everyone's taste...the Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer did NOT like them at all. I can't figure out why. This is one of my favorite CD's ever. (And surprise...I'm a little older than your standard alternative fan. People at work were surprised when I put up my k's choice poster.)"
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!,"The first songs I heard was Believe and Everything for free on MTV (Some of the best they ever made)So I bought Cocoon crash, And there were even beter songs on there.I have to say they were a lot less bold with this CD than with The Great Subconsious Club and Paradise in me."
5,Great Cd's from a great NEW band,"I thought that this cd was excellent, all of the music is good not only the popular tracks! I would recommend it to anyone who is into great pop music! Great Buy!"
3,Close ... no cigar,"You'd find some great songs on the CD, and Sarah's voice is pretty amazing. But somehow the Cd just comes a bit short. Maybe because some songs just don't have what the excellent ones do (Cocoon crash, Believe, Everything For Free), even Sarah's singing doesn't make up for the others. Like the band, I'm from Belgium, out here their music is commenly known as ""boy-scout rock"". Especially the Paradise In Me CD qualifies for that one. This is a step up, so I am anxious to see/hear what the next CD is going to bring us."
3,"Very, very close.","i first heard this album in belgium breifly and loved what i heard, so is soon as i returned to the states i bought it, continuing my search for good 'chick-rock'. The opening track is awesome, but as the album goes on, the songs get more generic and less interesting. At times it seems that they sacrifice the melody lines for the lyrics, which they write very articulately. they rhyme every line too- something not done that much anymore (for better or for worse). They do however experiment with different kinds of chord progressions on this album, which Sarah delivers very well. Her voice is unique though, kind of smoky and rich. With a few exceptions (tracks 1-4), the album is fairly repetetive guitar driven pop . .just. . . GOOD pop. (I think they could be huge in America if the word got out.) Basicly, it makes great background music or car music, but it would be boring to listen to alone."
4,Thank you Lilith Fair,I love this CD. I think it's the combination of guitars with some real substance and very passionate lyrics and beautiful melodies. I first heard of K's Choice on the Lilith Fair compilation CD which prompted me to buy all three of their CDs. I know I'm supposed to be commenting on the music of K's Choice but I also want to say that Sarah McLachlan has done a great thing by introducing all of us to music like this that hasn't gotten a lot of publicity.
5,Fabulous,This is one of my all time favorite CD's that I must have at all times. From great rock to slower ballads this album has it all. Sarah's voice can melt butter. Once you listen you won't be able to stop.
5,the best albom ever!!!!,this albom is the best albom i've ever listend to and the band k's choice is the most amazing band ever to be!!!! thrers nothing better then they're music!!!!!!! Adar.
2,It's becoming worse,"K's Choice is a fine band, but this CD is not okay. Once, in the beginning, when they were still called The Choice, I liked them very much. You should buy the first CD ""The great subconscious club"" with real crackers like ""The ballad of Lea and Paul"" or ""I smoke a lot"". Paradise in me was one step down and now this one...oh boy. Too focused on the American market, too much trying to be main stream. Come on, S and G, keep on rocking!"
5,Superior Lens,What is there to say about this lens that many others have not said. After several years of performance I would put this lens in the Top Two of my arsenal between fixed & zoom 'L' lenses.I use it for Weddings and HS Seniors. Overall a fantastik lens.[...]
5,Excellent lens!,Debated for a while over this lens v/s the f/4 sibling. Decided to go with the f/2.8 even though I had some reservations about the weight. I have since used the lens a few times and the weight has not been an issue. Background blur is awesome and even though this is a zoom I swear the pictures look as clear as a prime. If you're going to spend this kind of money on a lens I would say go for the f/2.8 - this is a great investment that will provide satisfaction with whatever you are photographing.
4,First Biggie,"This the first 'big' lens I've purchased in my 8 years of learning to get good photographs of subjects I enjoy. It seems to fulfill the need to have the ability to capture subjects well at a distance. I bought it to help get good shots of softball players. Since I play on a team, I am able to be on the field during play consequently wish I'd purchased Canon's Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Lens instead. This lens (24-70) would have given me that little bit more distance ability than the f/2.8 17-55 mm I normally use. Looking at the photo's metadata taken with the 70-200 mm lens I find most interesting, I see where 95% are taken at 70 mm. I need to say that only about 300 images have been captured with the 70-200 mm, I'm sure as time passes I should be able to learn to use it much better. (For what ever it's worth - most photos taken with the 17-55 mm lens mounted on a Canon 40D were taken at the 40-50 mm settings. The reason for four instead of five stars is mostly the weight.)"
5,a work horse!,what a lens! it can take a beating and keeps on going churning out beautiful images one after another. the is probably my most versatile lens in my lines of L lenses. Can't recommend enough!
5,Excellent Service,"Received lens today, WAY AHEAD of schedule. Good Job. Lens looks to be as advertised in very good shape. will try it out this week end at kids Taekwando meet and add to this review."
5,Fast medium telephoto zoom,"This is a fast 70-200mm lens, and f/2.8 max aperature is available throughout the zoom range. This gives me greater flexibility in low light or fast-action situations, and gives good depth-of-focus control. The fast lens speed and good image stabilization makes it more forgiving for hand-held shots. The IS will work on or off the tripod. Autofocus is fast and image quality is tops. It is well sealed for dust and moisture resistance (this does not mean waterproof).The price of having a faster lens is the greater weight and cost. If light weight is more important to you than speed, Canon's 70-200mm f/4 is lighter (and lower cost)."
5,Definitely worth the wait to save up for it!!!,"I had previously had the Canon 70-200 F4L lens, and couldn't justify spending the money for the upgrade...A year later, I bit the bullet and upgraded my 30D to a 5D, and realized the beauty of full frame DSLRs. At the same time, I went for the 70-200 IS, and have absolutely no regrets. The lens is super sharp, and in low lighting conditions, the lens holds amazingly!!!"
5,wow.,"yes it is a LOT of money. yes it is worth every penny. Instead of 10% really good shots, I got almost 50% worth posting to galleries and putting up for sale. This lens begs for a tripod or monopod (and I have both), but I was able to take lots of pictures comfortably with an old stitz flash handle - amazon's closest equivalent is hereSunpak Digital Camera Flash Adapter- connected to the LENS rather than the camera socket."
5,There is a reason why all the pros have this lens!,"I am a new to the scene wedding photographer and have just made enough cash to give a face lift to all my equipment. After shooting an outside wedding with a Sigma 55-200mm f/4-5.6 lens (and knowing that it would handle well being a slower lens and not needing to use it in a low lit church) I saw what I was missing out on! I got online and went to Amazon (because of their amazing prices that seem to be at least $100 cheaper for camera accessories) and purchased this gem.Upon trying it out, it was nothing less than stellar in all areas! I still have a 1.6x crop Canon 30D so at times the zoom is perfect and at others it is a little too much for the situation at hand. Technically the lens is a 112-320mm on a crop body so be aware of that."
4,Great image quality - very versatile,"I've had this lens for over a year now with my 20D. Excellent image quality, how ever there is some softness at f2.8. Great for low light, and background blur at wide open apertures."
3,It's not that big and it's not that heavy,I carry this all day for weddings and at motorsport events it's really not as heavy or as big as you might have read (try carrying a 500 f/4 IS around all day).If you're debating on getting the IS or getting the f/4 because of price that is one thing and only you can decide. But if you make your money shooting for a living.. think long and hard.... the f/2.8 can be stopped to f/4 the f/4 can't be opened to f/2.8. You can always turn IS off if you don't need it. It can mean the difference between someone paying you for that shot or not.
2,Unhappy :-(,"I bought this lens over a year ago with great expectations. I used it a lot but was not impressed with the images near 200mm and wide open. I was told that this lens does have a steep learning curve so I persisted.I decided to check for back/front focusing. I focused on the center line (Camera on tripod, IS off, Mirror lockup, manual focus with live view on 40D). The focus was centered on the ""Focus Here"" Line but it was not sharp. I had to zoom down to about 135mm @ f5.6 to get sharp focus. I was impressed with that sharpness, but I didn't pay for a 135mm f5.6 lens!I sent the lens to Canon for service and they said it was front focusing and they ""made an adjustment"". No difference as far as I could see. I truely had a bad copy but couldn't get it replaced after 30 days.I sold the lens and bought a 24-105 f/4L and couldn't be happier. I'm considering the 100-400 for my next purchase. I realize my experience is exceptional (In a bad way!), and hopefully you will have better luck."
5,Perfection,"Using this product has been a joy. i am a sports photographer for a college basketball and volleyball team. The pictures I have gotten with this lens have been amazing from the first time I used it to now.I owned the 4.0 non IS version of the 70-200 and that was great lens as well! But this blows it out of the water for almost every task i ever do.I found that the f4 is just not fast enough whereas i can get really fast results with this new 2.8 it is great!Go for the IS or you will just sell the lower one in a month or 6 months, lose money, then have to do it all over again."
5,The depth of her talents/spirituality is phenomenal!!!!!!!!,"My wife and have been particularly moved by this follow-up to ""A Heavenly Place."" Of course, it helped to see Jaci and gang in concert last month in Baton Rouge. I am always moved by ""Go So Loved,"" but have been touched also by the maturity noted in her other songs: ""Show You Love"" (about not coming off as someone trying to force a message) and ""You."" I would have to say that my favorite is ""Look What Love Has Done To Me,"" a beautiful love song about Jaci's relationship with God, that I find so poignant! Can't wait for any more stuff from this gal!"
4,"Jaci's CD is great, but not as good as Heavenly Place","After listening to Jaci's latest CD, I think it is good, but not nearly as good as her last. It wasn't as strong, and her vioce didn't shine as much. She needed more personal touch. But I still like it :)"
3,its ok,"i didn't think it was fantastic or anything. yeah, she had nice vocals but it didn't move me in any particular way. its just alright and if u have spare money, this album is it, if not, look elsewhere. there are better albums out there."
5,THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!,"Dear Everyone, You have GOT to listen to this CD!! My favorite songs are on this CD!! They include: Child Of Mine, Little Voice Inside, Made My World, and Show You Love!! You will like this CD instantly: as soon as you listen to ONE song!! You will jump up and down and not be able to wipe the all-around smile off of your face!! A MUST GET!!! MUCH better than Heavenly Place!! Much more well done!! ~SparklesP.S. I recommend the Much Afraid CD by Jars Of Clay too!! ANOTHER MUST GET!!! :)"
5,Better than her First,"Jaci's second CD is better than the first.I'm glad her music got harder,but is still very Christian!Favorites are Show You Love,Made My World,Child Of Mine,and You.One of the best Christian CD's."
5,This is a terrific CD for all to enjoy,"Her first CD was very good. This CD is outstanding-you can definitely notice the growth in her personal style! The music is beautiful and incredibly uplifting. As a 30-something year old individual, I thought I wouldn't be able to relate to such a young artist's music, but her music has so much depth and maturity that it can appeal to all ages. I look forward to her next release."
4,Thirty Years a Slave,"I liked this book.Slavery is such a sad topic and to think that so many good people was raised, worked and tortured is such a sad way for year end after year out with our governments complicity and the Supreme Courts and the courts of our land clearly knowing it. As a retired Judge it makes me very sad while at the same time, I lived through it.I do not remember any of my decisions condoning it whether I liked it not consciously or unconsciously. I thought it was so sad, from law school on.I liked the book. I kept thinking ""this could have been me, except but for the grace of God I did not live in the South and work in this environment.Leon Emerson"
1,Don't buy!,"I'm an able bodied guy in my 20's, this product is very difficult to use, one needs 3 hands! The 'Cable Zipper' is made of too rigid plastic for fingers and breaks fingernails and the 'Zip Clip' is too weak (thin plastic and pathetic action) to slide along even my thin flimsy cables that I wanted to 'tidy'. The worst item I've ever bought on Amazon!"
1,The Worst,"I must have gotten a bad lens based on these reviews but then again maybe they don't have to look at thousands of images at 100% in a photo editor. This is the worst lens I've ever owned. It is soft, soft, soft. Even my cheap 50mm 1.8 is significantly sharper.One reviewer said it's sharp on all four corners; not mine. It is embarrassingly fuzzy on the corners at any aperture and the edges as well as the middle too and forget about zone focusing. One of the great things about a lens like this is you can supposedly zone focus so that at .f.8 everything from 5 ft. to infinity is in focus - wrong.For the price this lens is a rip-off. This lens does have a sweet spot but you'll wait a long time finding it and it'll happen once in a blue moon. How can an image from a lens shot with a Canon 5D at 1/500 and .f.8 on a sunny day be soft? Unbelievable. Another reviewer wrote it can be had used for 30 Euros - I don't doubt it. Whoever buys mine when I upgrade should call the police."
4,"A good all-around ""normal"" lens","If you could only carry one lens for your Canon digital SLR, or you wanted to keep your gear to a minimum, this would be the only lens to carry. Of course, you would be limited in your range of photography, i.e. no large groups of people in small spaces; no sports photos.Otherwise, this is a very good lens for all-around photography."
1,"it's cheap, but it's GARBAGE","Canon generally makes excellent lenses, but my copy of this lens is awful! Even at f/8 with a fast shutter speed and low ISO, images are blurry when blown up to 100%. It also suffers from severe CA, particularly in bright settings. Yes, this lens is inexpensive, but I can't recommend it at any price. You would do much better to save your money and buy a better lens.Canon should pull the 28mm f/2.8 off the market."
4,"Sufficient quality and decently fast, but noisy","I have been happy with this lens so far, using it on a Canon 30D body. The glass is decent quality, without any significant vignetting. It's not particularly wide angle, due in part to the 1.3 magnification factor on the 30D, so not great for getting the full room at a party for instance, but works well for landscapes and such.My only complaint with it is the noise when focusing, which is significant, and can be distracting if you're shooting a wedding or conference where noise is an issue."
4,Zoo Story,I'll have to disagree with both of you. Great CD but the song Star sounds like Radiohead way more than U2 or Jimmie Eat World.
1,Get the original author's book,"This is NOT Joe Vitale's book. This is Genevieve Behrend's book. I read this author's books in the early '70's. Read the Product Description. ""Fiery Texas author breathes life into dead woman...."" Vitale took the two books, made some ""revisions,"" and can now sell them as ""his"" books. His name even appears first as the author! What a way to make money--off a dead woman, no less. Ms. Behrend's books are classics and are definitely worth reading just the way she wrote them. I would like to give 5 stars to Genevieve Behrend's original book and 0 stars to Joe Vitale's revised version."
2,A bit tipsy.,I originally thought that I'd like this a lot but I have since changed my mind. I find that it is a bit tipsy if I lean over to do something low while sitting on it. I have had it go out from under me several times and I've ended up on the floor. For that reason I no longer recommend it.
4,This Seat Is The Envy Of My Work place,"I am a 50 year old female, I use this this seat on my job as a merchandiser. I decided to buy this cart and spend alittle more money because I had already been through 2 cheaper carts and they lasted no time, so hopefully third time is a charm.I have only had this seat a month and every thing seems great, it has a large seat for comfort and 5 very large wheels which makes it alot easier to roll around on tiled grouted floors like I do on the job, since the wheels a larger they do not get stuck in the deep grout lines.It has only one glitch so far, if you lean forward on it to far it will try to tip over, so Mr. REL Stapleton fix this glitch and you will have the perfect seat!!R. BrooksSt. Louis, MO"
3,Bad Wheels,"One of 5 wheels has broke off in one week. I had to by a new set of wheels, all 5. I can ship old ones to the seller for reimbursement. Haa!!"
1,Dissapointed,"I am a mechanic and to avoid the $300 Snap-On bill I chose to go with this seat. One wheel broke off in less than a month (I welded it back on) the second broke off about a month later. To make a long story short, all 5 wheels have been welded on and wont be breaking of any time soon. The seat cover does not handle daily use well. The entire front edge has worn through."
4,Emotionally Moving Score,"This is the only score that actually caused me to cry at the start of a movie. A fantastic score and some wonderful period songs as well. The piece Early Days, Massapequa, 1957 was used by NBC during their 9/11 coverage and it is very moving. I also enjoyed the cover Edie Brickell did of Hard Rain."
1,"Clogs, clogs, & clogs some more ...","This product is a stinker! While mowing only a weeks worth of growth, the grass consistently clogs in the lower portion of the chute. I always mow dry grass, and I've tried different speeds & mow heights. Still, the bagger clogs. I even bought the ""extreme"" blades that MTD offers ... didn't help any. The only time the bagger does not clog is when I mow unhealthy portions of my lawn. Word from the wise ... don't by this bagger ... and since this is the only one that is offered for the various MTD models (mine is a TroyBilt), this probably means you should look at other brands if you desire to bag your grass."
2,"Saves raking, not your time or gas.","Uneven distribution in bags, plugs up extremely easily and difficult to clear. Works if you mow only 1"" or less of very dry grass. Otherwise you have to mow one day, wait a day or two to let it dry and then mow it again with the catcher to be able to pick up the grass. Twice as much gas. People with 46"" mowers don't mow a little bit of grass - to mow my yard I will empty the bags 20-25 times. Each time 1. stop the blades, 2. set the parking brake, 3. out of gear, 4. get off and lift the seat, 5. raise the lid, 6. take off each bag and dump it, 7. re-attach the bags, lower the lid, put the seat down, get on, in gear, etc., etc. - 5 min. of mowing and do it over again. If you go one pass too far the chute plugs - add 5 minutes to disassemble the chute, pull out the grass, reassemble the chute."
2,Poor album,"I like Victor Manuelle but this is his weakest album, full of fillers and over produced. He sings without any sensitivity and the arrangements are too over the top. Bring back Sergio George."
3,Basic Tips for Begginers..,"It would be better if the video had slow motion sequences. But in general, the video has several useful tips and advices."
4,Great Instructional Video,This instructional tape is outstanding for any young or old budding tennis hopeful. Tom explains in detail all facets of the game. I especially liked the forehand topspin shot explanation. Was great - and works. I recommend the tape.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!,"How anybody can describe this as a ""MUST SEE"", is way beyond me! The acting sucks! The movie is really stupid! Maybe if you are high or something, you might get a kick out of it. Seriously, peeps, I WARNED YOU GUYS!"
4,"""contagious collection from early rockers...four stars""","Early rockers from the mid '70s, a new release from Hip-O Records ~ ""Yesterday & Today Ultimate Collection""...hard rock & heavy metal is the theme...seventeen tracks sends you reeling...must mention the stand out ~ ""MIDNIGHT IN TOKYO"", will knock your socks off (if you're wearing any)...with carefree-power unlimited. Great job by Hip-O and of course our hosts of this ""rambunctious party"" ~ Y & T!Total Time: 77:38 on 17 Tracks ~ Hip-O Records 069-490-889-2 ~ (2001)"
3,A good book for starters,"I bought this book to be used in a graduate level Virology class. It gives you a good deal of information while trying to be organized.Let's see how I do with my class first, but I think that, except for some minor errors, it is a good source for consultation to a beginner in the field.Thanks ASM."
1,Most unorganized text ever used,"This book was by far the worst science book I've ever used. Being a senior in biochemistry, Ive used and studied many texts and this one was the most unorganized and went so far in depth that the concepts just became confusing. Definitely not a book to be used by someone with little prior knowledge of virology or microbiology for that matter."
1,Not so great... go another route,"This book is ok if you have ADD and memorize the dictionary for fun (no offense to those who do); it jumps around more than a jackrabbit and misses the forest for the trees.As an example of the style of writing this book uses: No, let me change that, it sort of, kind of does miss the forest for the trees, but actually not the trees. You see, it misses the forest for the leaf on a branch covered with bark on a tree, not just any tree, but an oak tree with little acorns, not so little that you have to squint to see them, but little enough that they aren't big. We'll cover acorns in the chapter that is 4 chapters after this one, but for now let me delve into extreme detail about acorns... and so on...This does give decent knowledge, and does cover the topic in great length, but the disorganization and verbose, tangential language decreases the value of this book to one of an expensive paperweight. Save yourself the trouble - buy a different text!"
4,Revisiting them again,"This is a powerful weapon to take control of the radio when you're planning a long car trip with a classic rock person. As soon as his favorite radio station fade away, you just insert this one. If like me, you are tired of ""Radar love"", it does not matter since you hear other great ones. Personal favorite are ""She flies on strange wings"" for the bass when he sings the title lyrics and the slow part. ""Mad love's comin'"" for those repitive guitar notes that I keep on playing my mandolin just to pratice beat. And the lovely ""Twilight zone"".Just forget to play ""Clear night moonlight"" and ""The devil made me do it"" awful."
4,Oh! I wanna wax to this baby!,"I love this greatest hits collection, but where the heck is their master, ""And They Danced""! I live on a bridge and my 2 brothers live in old vans at the bottom. I invited ONE of my brothers to a huge party at my wooden bridgetop estate and we all jammed to this sensational recording! I play this all the time since my wife always locks me in the garage."
2,I wish this were better,"Well, I wanted to like this because I know that they were a decent psych-pop band in the 60's, plus they get bonus ironic cool points for having their silly ""Radar love"" featured on The Simpsons (twice!), and, growing up in the 80's, I absolutely LOVE ""twilight zone."" But this is just kind of bland 70's style rock, not hard enough to be called hard rock or technically complex enough to rate with the heavyweights of progressive rock. Even worse is the later ""new wave"" flavored stuff which is to real new wave what ""Flashdance"" and ""Footloose"" were to, say, The Clash. I can't fault them for following musical trends -- like 99% of other bands out there, Golden Earring were followers and not innovators. But while I can take mediocrity in 60's psychedelic rock, I sure can't in middle-of-the-road 70's rock. I respectfully dissent with those reviewers who compare this to Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd."
2,The 2 stars are for the first and last songs on the album.,"This album begins with the great and classic song ""Radar Love"" and ends with the great and classic song ""Twilight Zone."" Between those two songs is one hour of forgettable, mediocre music. If you did not know better you would think that it was two different bands."
5,Golden Earring Nr1 Rock band,"An absolute fanatastic band, with a great sound. acoustic as well as electric. Songs as ""she flies on strange wings"" and ""the devil made me do it"" are GREAT. Golden earring is more much more than just ""radar love"" and ""twilight zone""!!"
3,"Awesome songs, ok album","Radar Love is one of my favorite songs, and Twilight Zone is awesome, but the rest of the album does not meet the high bar set by these classics."
5,Twilight Zone,"Still one of the best pieces of music, Twilight Zone ""Rocks"" as much today as it did when it was new! The entire CD is great!"
4,Interesting and Fun to Read,"This book really helped me with AP Bio and i really got into it! It focused on all the important information and gave great examples! its a new edition and is updated. go out and buy this book, if you read it thoroughly it will give you ultimate preparation or a good background in Biology!"
2,useless textbook,"the main problem with this book is that you need a huge vocabulary to understand what its talking about. This book is not adapted for high school students. I was astonished how long and pointless the descriptions are. Although the labs are very good, it took my class several readings to understand the material. The main problem with this book is that its not written with kids in mind. I liked the materials at the back of the book (such as, how to use a microscope) as these are very useful, however I am not impressed with the contents of the book itself. It is extremely heavy and bulky and contains much unneded information. Although it has its' pros, there are too many cons."
5,Good book for college biology I and II,"I had to use this book for my college I and II classes. I must say the book is very complete. Sometimes written on a high level but then again some topics of biology are hard in general like genetics and animal physiology. For really good test preparation questions, I was recommended to also get:The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations (Volume 1, Volume 2 and Volume 3). These three guides made me life much easier because the questions showed me what to expect on my actual college exams."
4,Savage Ecstasy...whispered kisses...follow the wind...,"Morning Star knew it was her duty as an Oglala princess to join with a warrior of her tribe. After all, she was the granddaughter of the revered Gray Eagle, and her father was the great Chief Sun Cloud. But the moment she gazed into the sky-blue eyes of Joseph Lawrence, she realized he was fated to be in her life-circle. For he was the man of legend, the white man who would lead her tribe to peace. He was also the lover who would stir her soul with forbidden desires. Together they would know a great destiny ... and an everlasting love!"
2,Overly Sentimental,"I'm a big fan of the Bolitho series but the later novels seem to be much more about sentimental relationships rather than naval action. In this one, Bolitho doesn't even go to sea until page 151. There's still good stuff here, but it's getting harder to wade through all the tear jerking."
1,Dreadful,"I hardly ever give up on a book once I have started it. I have read earlier books in this series, and was looking forward to this chapter. But it's dreadful. Its more like a Mills and Boon romantic novel for middle aged women. Utter tosh. Do not waste your money on this, unless you are a lonely spinster."
3,Not up to par!,"While I enjoyed this book, I don't feel that it was up to par with the rest of the books in the series. The story seemed a bit too contrived and there was not enough action in the book. In addition, the action sequences were not up to par with what has been written in previous books. In summary, the story seemed a bit forced."
2,Tired formula writing,"There really is no point in straying beyond O'Brian, Forrester, Parkinson or Showell Styles. Kent and Pope are in the same mould; poor research, improbable characters, formula writing. Don't waste your time on this book."
3,Wil-be nothing to Brag about in two for me.,"Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course. Wilco too. And Billy--well, of course, of course. But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean? Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album. I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie. I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal. Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me. If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely. If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy. Borrow from a friend first."
3,There are some real jewels here,"""California Stars"" is as beautiful a song as I have ever heard, all the credit in the world to Wilco for really bringing those lyrics to life. I think Woody Guthrie would have been more than thrilled with the rendition. Moreover, Bragg does a nice job with ""Way Over Yander.."" I think these are the two clearly outstanding songs on the album. My problem with this album is that some of the other songs are a tad weak, especially the ones that tend to be Bragg numbers. I think Wilco does carry their weight for the most part, but if you are expecting ""Summerteeth"" or ""Yankee Hotel.."" you will be very letdown."
2,"good idea, just unconvincing","What could be a better combination than Woody Guthrie and Wilco? Well, the album falls flat; the performances are affected, the arrangements unconvincing... The album has been well-received critically, but I have to believe that this is out of deference to Guthrie's stature in American song rather than the strength of the album... Natalie Merchant's voice is really annoying too."
5,An Awesome CD,"I picked up this CD for a couple of reasons, but mostly to round out my Uncle Tupelo, Wilco and Son Volt collection. I heard Jeff Tweedy do ""Hoodoo Voodoo"" during a one-man acoustical show last year and I wasn't overwhelmed, so I had rather modest expectations of Mermaid Avenue. Also, I didn't think highly of Billy Bragg. The CD has blown me away. Both Bragg and Tweedy of Wilco have shown that they are multi-talented. I love all the songs on the CD. I am left wondering whether there will be a second CD of previously unreleased Guthrie material in the near future."
4,Whisper on,This is like hearing a whisper from the past. Bragg and Wilco provide the sensitive soundtrack to Woody's intense (and sometimes goofy)lyrics. I doubt any other collaborators could have done as well. Damned fine record.
1,This CD made my ears bleed.,I cannot understand why anyone in their right mind would ever buy this horrid CD. It made my ears bleed.
4,Do you know how hard it is to JUST ADD MUSIC to lyrics?,"Especially if those lyrics are over 50 years old, practically poetry, and created by a master songwriter!? Or put another way, imagine someone handing you the lyrics to a tune from ""Nebraska"" and saying, ""OK, now just sing it real good."" JESIS, I don't think so. And if that doesn't put this stellar effort by Bragg and Wilco into perspective, what more can I tell ya? [Eh, keep yer shorts on, there'll be another 3rd Blind Biscuit Korn Hole album out 'terrectly.]So i'm amazed they pulled it off? And with such interesting results -- there really is something here for all kinds of tastes: from the breadth of musical influences displayed [a bit of Dylan, Lennon, Garcia, the Band, it could on and on] to the lyrical content [from the personal to the political].Essential? You'd have to agree."
4,woody would be proud.,"in the age of britney spears it seams that rock is dead, but then there's wilco, courageosly fighting the battle against pop, this time with the help of a british folkie and one (dare i say) pioneer of rock, a man from a time long before the backstreet boys. The albumn takes a little getting used to, and falls a little short in the shadow of the brilliant ""being there"", but all in all, its a great piece of work...and a sign that rock 'n roll can still be real."
5,Eclectic and Fantastic,"I am a huge Wilco/Tupelo/Son Volt etc. fan. The ""alt.country"" is some of the best music being made today. I bought this album because of Wilco, it instantly became one of my favorite albums. ""California Stars"" is simply beautiful. Natalie Merchant's background singing in ""Minor Key"" is nothing short of heartstopping. This album is a great concept, a great collaboration and one of the best albums of the year.For alt.country fans check out Son Volt's ""Wide Swing Tremolo""- another excellent album from Jay."
5,Great Product,I have been using this product for years and it is a great shampoo for dry scalps.It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.
4,works great!,The product works really well. But it stinks! I expected it to stink and it does. I would buy again just because it works really well so I can get over the smell.
4,Good for what's ailing you (psoriasis),"I have suffered with psoriasis for over ten years and have tried all the psoriasis shampoos on the market. The ones without tar don't work. Recently my demonologist gave me a generous sampling of shampoos to try, and this was the least strong smell of tar and it is effective, especially in conjunction with my RX of Derma Smoothe scalp treatment. I will be ordering it from Amazon repeatedly."
5,Informative and interesting--but heavy,"This text has been quite an interesting read; while I haven't exactly poured over all of its length, the cestions I have read for my art history class are full of things like methods, media, and social information. ..The only thing to watch our for is: This book weighs ten pounds. It is *very heavy* to carry back and forth to class and I avoid that whenever possible. If the class can be managed by buying only Volume 1 or Volume 2 of this text, that would be the way to go. But otherwise it's excellent."
1,"Mostly, boring history of art in churches.","The parts about non-European art are good but too short. There is not near enough about the actual art theory and technique of the artists and works. There is far, far, too much emphasis on religious art, and churches. I had this book for a class. I would have been very sad if I had purchased this for enjoyment."
5,Great Value!,"I had considered the iBook, but the added value of the G4 and big screen make this discontinued PowerBook a great value. The ATI 7500 graphics card in this is not the ATI 9000 model in the latest Powerbooks, but this doesn't have a big speed impact unless you use lots of video editing software. I'm using the Powerbook for multi-track audio recording with Emagic's Logic. This laptop has enough power for that and all my other apps. I do recommend more ram though if you are running complex music sequencing, video, or photo editing. I added an additional 512 MB ."
1,...,"I got this because I thought is would be durable. I was very wrong. It has problems with the paint bubbling up and falling off of the front. ... I have never gotten an apple that did not have major hardware issues. ... The software is really rockin, but this version of the powerbook has more than one problem... Check the review sites ... for all the gory details. Then get a G4 tower or an IMac maybe? Good luck with your purchase. The new powerbooks are alumimim and so should not have this problem. ..."
2,Nice screen,"Nice screen, but that is about it.Runs very hot. Fan is very loud. Machine is unable to accomplish any difficult task without kicking fan up to hair dryer speed. DVDs can't be enjoyed because of the very loud fan noise.Case scratches and dents easily. Mine never leaves the house, and looks [horrible]. The paint is pealing off. The screen touches the keyboard when closed and picks up finger grease from keyboard. The edges of the base are sharp and cut into wrists, limiting circulation. Extended typing is impossible. No provision to adjust processor speed. No provision to prevent hard disk from running. MS Explorer is incapable of surfing without running HDD. Machine is fragile. Seems like designers were bent on 1"" design target, and forgot about durability/comfort.Included OSX has awful user interface and few features. Luckily OS 9 also runs on this platform. Wide screen iBook is better choice if you don't need true dual display support."
5,Great service,Service great by Amazon Got here when they said it would and has been great fun and quality of game is great
4,Whitest Flower,"I recently visited Southwest Ireland and this book was recommended to me as having more information about the potato famine. Not only did it help me with a better understanding of the Irish people, but It was a good read."
3,Book for School,"This book is too technical and often confusing. There is good material in the book, meaning the context is good but chapters are way too long and very confusing."
3,Fragile,I have two of these battery packs for my XL2 and both are being held together buy gaffers tape. The battery clips are plastic and break easily. They also don't allow you to charge and use at the same time which is disapointing.
1,rip off,Should have researched more carefully. Picture features 4 candles and in the description is says 3x3 3x6 3x9 and 4x4 square. It is in fact one 3x3 candle for $6.99. Will be sending back immediately.
5,Unscented candle. Yes!!,"I love candles and haven't been able to enjoy them for years. The fragrances are a real problem for me. Because I haven't been able to find normal sized unscented candles locally, I took a chance on this candle and I am very pleased: It's truly unscented, a beautiful snowy white, and burns like a dream with a nice even flame. I'll definitely buy more."
1,"picture not accurate, discription wrong.",Not enthused with the price of the item when it finally arrived. I thought I was getting more than one candle. Not impressed. sorry
3,Not impressed,"Quick burning, only received one little candle but didn't last very long. Not a good deal for the price. For 7 or 8$ you can get a lot more candles than this at the dollar store."
2,It will hook you...then you bleed,"Sibling rivalries aside, Michael has a few catchy lyrics and some harmonies that work well, but often the music sounds clumsy, if not wanting to be more than it is."
4,It's a BROTHER thing...and we understand!!!,"I saw GLJ in London back in the 80s, before sibling rivalry tore the band apart (how can 2 bands operate with the same name?)and it was fantastic. since then I wondered what was missing from the Jay Aston GLJ, and I think I know now-his brother Michael, the lead singer of classics like Always Aflame,Heartache, The immigrant and others. This CD from the Mikey lineup SIZZLES. The title track is my hands-down favorite, catchy as hell and very intense, very goth fabulous. Good production throughout. Oh, and ignore the first negative review of this from KIDREVIEW or whatever (if you ARE a kid, kidreviewer, then all is forgiven). she obviously is not a sharp listener, if she was, she would hear that the lyric in 'Exploding Girl' says: ""she might be wrong but she might be right, who can ever tell?""in other words, its a complicated issue, not cut and dried as you see it, this is NOT pro-suicide bomber song. for the love of Christ!"
5,It's all too beautiful,This is a wondeful cd. It's deep yet groovy and hypnotic and mesmering. You MUST SUBMIT !=.)
1,Michael Aston is NOT Gene Loves Jezebel,"What an absolute joke this guy is. I was very disappointed to find he was actually representing himself as the real thing when he is nothing other than a poor imitation of his very talented brother. I was also duped by this guy at a live concert, I walked out after two songs. This album is just another weak attempt to take advantage of the good name of Gene Loves Jezebel, it's really too bad."
2,Bunch of Typical Anti-American Propoganda from a Washed Up Loser.,"Mikey kicked me off his board last year for pretending to be a liberal. Well, tough! This album is garbage, and anyone who admires dummies for getting run over by bulldozers for the right to be less than a second class citizen has no true respect for women at all! The only good song on it is ""Wind and Fire,"" and the rest gives off the distinct scent of dead rodents in heat. Oh, yeah, it's so noble to blow yourself up so some jerk can beat you up and set you on fire. Yay, Mikey, and yay for any female who thinks this guy is doing anything but trying to get attention from the liberals by overdoing the stance himself. Mister Rogers wants to know if you can say ""posuer."""
5,A Stirring & Passionate Album,Frontman Michael Aston has made a true masterpiece with this album. Both lyrics & music are now on a level you can expect from a major act as for instance U2. Michael's voice is becoming stronger than ever!If you're a fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers or U2: don't miss this classic Gene Loves Jezebel.
4,Light enough for a walk-around,"This is an often maligned lens, due to its high cost and the lower contrast compared to regular lenses. Both are true and the latter is easily fixable in the digital workflow. The upside that no other lens can compete with is, that one can carry it for miles without undue strain, handhold for substantial periods of time, like waiting a few minutes for some wildlife to move into position, or for some sports action to happen. Obviously, there are even lighter 400mm lenses, but those have typically no image stabilization and a very small maximum aperture.At this point for me, this is my one size fits all super telephoto lens. There are sharper lenses, longer lenses, faster lenses, etc. but this one can do almost everything, and do it good enough."
4,Canon 400 DO is Wildlife Solution!,"Lens is great!! There is a slight issue with contrast, but this is easily adjustable by adjusting internal camera settings or by computer software. With my canon 7D, I can set the internal contrast adjustment on the high side and compensate for the issue With that adjustment, picture quality is better than my canon 100-400 f4-5.6. Has good sharpness at long distance, which is a primary reason for purchase. Also does very well with a 1.4 canon converter. I like the lens because it is relatively light and more compact than canon,s other prime 400s. This works very well for me since I shoot mostly wildlife and the lens can be easily handheld and I have carried it for 6 hours in rugged terrain using a shoulder strap with no problem. This is a great lens for the serious wildlife/nature photographer. I highly recommend it."
5,Stargate SG-1__The Second Seson,For all you SG-1 fans out there this is a must have to add too your collection its a great price and will be shiped too you in no time at all. tks euroman498
3,Pas de trame sonore francaise...,"Je suis extrmement déu de ne pas avoir la trame sonore en franais. J'aime bien avoir la version originale anglaise mais la trame sonore francaise aurait été appréciée. Je ne pense d'ailleurs pas conserver le coffret de cette deuxième saison à cause de cela. Pour le prix, par contre, c'était extra.Toutes les saisons de Stargate SG1 devraient par contre figurer à votre collection si vous tes un vrai fan! Pour ceux qui comme moi ont un appareil multi-région... la version avec trames sonore francaise est disponible en France... mais pas mal plus coteuse par contre."
1,Need,"Ugh, probably the most frustrating episode I've ever watched and hope to watch of SG1 anymore. If not for the fact I wish to watch every episode, I would have quickly moved to the next. As usual, Daniel acts more self-centered than ever and disregards the safety of the whole team, which is absolutely repulsive to me. SGC should have gone in to rescue SG1 and wasted anyone in their way. Ugh, I just don't like the way Daniel acts, whether it is a good action, he generally puts the whole team at risk which was quickly seen within the first 2 minutes of the episode."
5,It doesn't get much better than this.,"I saw Stargate the movie and wasn't very impressed, but from the first time I saw an episode of SG-1, I was hooked. Stargate SG-1 is one of the greatest Sci-Fi TV series of all time. In my book the only thing that could beat it is Star Trek TNG. And this DVD series is much more affordable than it's Star Trek counterpart.I was so excited when I found out they had the first two seasons of this on DVD. I went out and bought them immediately. All the tiny little nitpicks I had about the Season 1 set were solved in this one. Season 2 is a great season and the DVD set reflects that. I love the extras. The featurettes are all really interesting, although a couple more wouldn't have hurt, and we're still waiting for a Jack O'Neil one. I also think an audio commentary track on these episodes would be really great, but I can understand that that would be a huge undertaking. These DVDs are terrific and I'm counting the days till Season 3."
3,"""Coulda"" had the whole thing","Well this was a good surprise. Good quality DVD's. A might bit expensive for a show off the air, but not a surprise.maybe one day the price for the full set will be a little more reasonable."
4,"Watched with my wife when it first aired, now got my daughters hooked",We have been rewatching this show as a family with my 9 and 12 year old daughters.They love it. There are a few episodes from the showtime days which you need to filter out for content (Hathor) but all in all good func sci fi for everyone.They are really getting into the character development of the show and enjoying the interplay between characters.DW and I are also enjoying watching the episodes again and rediscovering why we enjoyed it so much the first time.Definitely one of the best sci-fi series ever
4,Warning for the pilot,"My husband and I followed the entire series from beginning to end, and loved it. We are scifi fans. :) Because I had seen all of the episodes, I had no reason to check the rating. I was watching the pilot while running on my treadmill, and almost fell off when a full on naked chick came on screen! I realize there are people out there who enjoy that kind of thing, but I am not one of them. I was pretty ticked off. Other than that, I love the series."
4,review,good series. 21 episodes of a good sci fi series. Great part is the Dr. Much better than Amanda Tapping. Go Girl..
3,SG1 season 2,"The picture quality, whilst excellent,was a bit jumpy at times.I've been through 3 of these dvd's so far and in every episode the picture flickers and sticks momentarily, every so often."
4,The best of SciFi,I love the premise and the writiing make it believable. The characters are well developed throughout the stories. Samantha Carter is my favorite character.
5,Hard to find non-English languages,"This is not really about the box, since I simply rate it great. The problem is that if I find I title, I would like also to see immediately if there is also a version for my own language (Italian). It is very hard in Amazon to find the right language for DVDs. It looks like language is a secondary option. It is not! Amazon should add a list of all the vailable language version of each title."
3,Subtitles,"Season 1 i'll give it 5 stars for subtitles but on the others there are no subtitles. The series are excellent, all is perfect but it would be better and sell better if they would have subtitles in English or Spanish."
3,"Great TV, but poor features","Look, the show is great. But this is the only DVD I have bought that will not allow me to pause the scene. I would like to be able to look at some of the special effects while paused. THe special documentaries leave a lot to be desired. Oh well..."
5,Season Two is one of the best!,"Fans of ""Stargate SG-1"" will tell you that the show's second season is easily one of the best. In the wake of Apophis' attack on Earth, the show kicked into high-gear and never looked back! Sam's life would be changed forever; Daniel would discover a dark secret about his wife; and SG-1 would meet two of their greatest allies, and see the defeat of one of their greatest enemies.Season Two includes ""The Fifth Race,"" regarded by many (myself included) as the show's best episode.MGM has been slow in releasing the series onto Region 1 DVD, but hopefully it won't take another year and a half to see Season Three! The Season One DVD set is outstanding, with top-notch audio and video transfers, and tons of rewatchability. Extra features are slim for Season One, but expect them to become more and more plentiful as the show's DVD releases progress."
5,Great watching,I never got to see the series except the last year. I am glad these are available. They are a good escape and you enjoy the comradarie.
5,SIMPLE THE BEST!,I AM A HUGE STARGATE FAN. I WAS SO SORRY WHEN IT ENDED BUT NOW I CAN LOOK AT THE SHOW ANYTIME I WANT AND I AM GOING TO GET EVERY SEASON.
3,Not the best season of SG1,"Not my favorite season of SG1. The plot takes some ridiculous digressions.That said, it is the season we meet the Tok'Ra, Linnea, and Jacob Carter.My favorite episode of this season is The Fifth Race, where O'Neil accidentally has all the knowledge of the ancients downloaded into his brain. This has the brilliant combination of comedy and seriousness that we have come to love in this series.If you love SG1 you will continue to love it through this season, but don't look for the greatness of other seasons here."
4,"Why yes, I understand you perfectly!",Fun series. Wish they would explain why everyone after the first couple of episodes speaks English.
2,Great Series Bad Copy?,I've eagerly awaited the second season and have spent any free time going over any episodes I've missed. I've noticed several places where the DVD skips or picture breaks up. I've tried on all systems in the house and it must be the DVDs themselves. I figured MGM would do better as long as we had to wait.
3,Lost 2 stars due to lack of extras,"Yes, it's a great series. Yes, we're all smiling silly at the opportunity to see the episodes in season 2. But the DVD format is supposed to allow for the inclusion of extras, which simply aren't there this time. Very sad. Season 1 DVDs had captions; not this time. Season 1 DVDs had several featurettes; season 2 has only one. Season 1 had innovative navigation screens; season 2's is as dull as can be.Season 2 DVDs should improve on the first season's release, being better, richer, not less so. In any case, this series is remarkable by the quality of its screenplays, production, concepts and ideas - if you like sci-fi, you should check it out.We can only hope that Season 3 will come anytime soon and will have what every DVD release has: extras (in addition to great sound and picture quality, of course)."
3,Another Holodeck Fantasy,"This episode is a repeat of many other sci-fi plots involving immersive virtual worlds. In fact, Dwight Schultz was in a couple of them in Star Trek: TNG. He was better as Lt. Barclay. There was no question that the team would escape. The main question of the viewer is how. This was accomplished without any real creativity. However, I did enjoy watching O'Neill relive his past and struggle with the death of a friend. Daniel Jackson's experience gave the viewer new insight which ultimately did not have anything to do with the conclusion of the episode. Carter realizes the environment is fake--something this viewer understood as explicit from the moment the cast got plugged in. So, the plot was limp with the characters diffusely strung upon it. Worth watching for a Stargate fan!"
1,MGM NE VEUT RIEN SAVOIR DES FRANCOPHONES,"MGM a decide de ne pas inclure la trame sonore fracaise dans le coffret de la deuxieme saison. Il en va de meme pour la trame sonore espagnol. Pourquoi? On t'il utilise l'espace pour rajouter plus de materiel bonus? NON. Alors pourquoi avoir modifier le format audio depuis le coffret de la premiere saison.Tout simplement par ce que pour eux, les francophones d'Amerique du Nord sont des citoyens de seconde classe.Pour repondre a leur manque de respect, j'ai revendu mon coffret et je n'achaiterai plus aucun de leur produit a present."
5,"AMAZING, ITS HERE FINALLY!!","WELL, MGM finally squeezed every penny out of sindication and now the second season is finally here! This season is considered to be the worst season of the series while season 1 is considered to be the best, especially the episode ""politics"", which was rated as the best episode ever. The second season only has 2 episodes that you can call good which are ""family"" and the extra episode the did not air on TV, but comes hidden on the third DVD of this set, ""Lost"" which is absolutly amazing. I give this five stars because its stargate and that alone makes it worth buying!!!"
1,Boring,Stargate SG-1 is a terribly un-original series. All that is pertained in the series was clearly derived originally from other works of science fiction and then slightly built on. The quality of the acting and just the overall presentation is laughable. The series should have ended when the movie it was based on flopped.
2,Show is great; dvds not so much.,"Love the Stargate Sg-1 series... Watched every episode on TV, when it was aired. That being said, thought I would snatch this show up while such a good deal for the holidays.Received package today, nothing wrong with it, shipped in nice tight box, dvds have no scratches on them.Watched a couple episodes. Audio was great, the video quality was a little lacking; like the quality you see when you copy a DVD on computer and compress it down to make it fit to a certain size.The main bug I have with it, is the compression may be too much. While watching the episodes the video will do a freeze for a second or two, the audio will keep playing but the video has paused. All the episodes I watched had this issue, some episodes did this over 20 times. I even watched it in 3 different dvd players, and they always froze in the same spot...So I know its nothing physically wrong with the discs, but whoever copied and compressed them down from the masters, is not a hero."
5,NID did it again.,"This episode was good, but the NID (and we know who and what they are.) tried to mess everything up again. I enjoyed it. 2 Thumbs up for SG1."
1,Not as Described,"This review is in no way a reflection of the show , but of the item recieved which is not the item advertised. The item that was advertised was the new white thin box with special features the item recieved was the older version of the thin box set which is not as good, or what was advertised for sale."
5,Awesome,"VERY good season, can't wait for Season 3 to become available. The actors are GREAT & the storylines are never ending!!! It REALLY fires the imagination!!"
5,Excellent set,"This season is by far one of the best - how can you not rate this lower then 5 stars? For all you interested Season 3 will come out on DVD between January and June 2003, hopefully the former! This is confirmed. Also Season 4 will be comming out on DVD in September 2003 - MGM is speeding up the process of releasing these DVD sets. There is still no word when season 5 or 6 is due out on DVD and I can't wait to see the new season 7 episodes which will air at the end of this year - Yes thats right Sci-fi channel has confirmed it Season seven is a go with all the original cast returning including the return of michael shanks. If you think season 2 was good wait till you see what is comming - it will blow you away!!!"
1,terrible quality and lots of skipping,"It's unfortunate that MGM has chosen to release such a poor quality set of DVDs. The picture quality is extremely grainy to the point that it seems like you're watching a VHS tape, during the dark scenes. This might have been fine 10 years ago, but for anyone who has become used to HD quality, you won't just be disappointed, you'll likely find your viewing experience far less enjoyable than you were hoping.I have also had LOTS of problems with the discs skipping and freezing up, in spite of having a relatively new (Blu-ray) player that I'm using. Even after inspecting the discs (which appear to be fine and which were sold as new by Amazon) and cleaning them, the episodes continue to freeze up. Extremely disappointing.Sadly, it appears that this is our only option for purchasing these on DVD, and it seems unlikely that they will get remastered soon, if ever."
4,Better than season one!,"I loved the film and half of the episodes from season one. The other half from the first season were too obsessed with drama and poor plots. But the pilot was good and so were the other half of the episodes from the season. In season two, however, almost all the episodes were good. Once again we have good plots and a lot of action. Highly recommended!"
1,fake,"When i buy this product, the photo show a complete kit, but just send 1, i think thats isn't good because is something fake"
1,the picuture's deceiving,"I haven't tried the product yet.This review is only to point out that although the picture of the product looks like there's 3 bottles of various kinds of carekit, notice there's actually ONLY a 4oz pump spray bottle."
3,Great products but arrived in damaged box,The products arrived in a very dusty looking box that wasnt sealed properly HOWEVER the products are amazing and made the guitars in our house look brand new! Excellent products so it was a shame that the presentation of the products wasnt great as these were a Christmas gift & I had to tape the box back together.
2,They need to not advertise it the way they did,"Its says ""Fender Instrument Care KIT"" but it only comes with the polish and nothing else"
4,EASY MUSIC MAKING MACHINE!,THIS HARMONICA IS AS GOOD AS ANY STARTER HARP.IT IS A HOHNER BUT MADE IN CHINA-BUT THATS OK BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO PLAY AND SOUNDS GOOD AND YOU CANT GO WRONG FOR THE MONEY! PLAY THIS FOR A WHILE AND THEN BUMP UP TO A $20-$30 HARP IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE MAKING MUSIC. ENJOY-RELAX AND BE HAPPY. PEACE...
3,Gigolo Aunts - 'Flippin' Out' (RCA),"Boston area band's second effort.Loud,heavy and noisy pop-like.Sounds decent to me.Good alternative rock&roll to be experienced here.Tunes I thought were fun to hear were ""Ride On Baby Ride On"",""Pin Cushion"",""Lemon Peeler"" and ""Mrs.Washington"".Line-up:Dave Gibbs-vocals,Phil Hurley-guitar,Paul Brouwer-bass and Steve Hurley-drums.Might appeal to fans of The Posies,Mathew Sweet,Let's Active and The db's."
3,Now that I know better,"... I really really hate the double wing locking knobs on the legs -- what a pain. And from the photo, looks like 2 pieces to me, the head and they tripod. uh-uh. no separating these things. Now that I know better ..."
3,Set Your Heart Free (30 Days With a Great Spiritual Teacher),"From an awesome series, Set Your Heart Free penetrates.Not overwhelmed by excessive content, concise, direct, yet full.Something is very different about these texts as ""devotionals.""I have never liked devotionals.I love these.These help connect the time I set aside for prayer and meditation with actual connection, if that makes sense.I am grateful someone shared this series with me.I got the product in the mail within a reasonable amount of time at a reasonable price.Shipping is outrageous.Garret"
2,The new(er?) cigar companion,"I bought this book to replace one by the same title and was dissapointed that it bears no resemblance to the 3rd edition that I had lost. While it is a handsome book, I was ultimately disappointed. What was a clear and concise review of many cigars widely available has become a very limited survey of a few cigars many of which are not easily obtainable. Most frustratingly, the reviewers will describe a certain stick as ""the best of this manufacturer"" and then go on to review a different offering from the same company without further reference to the cigar they deemed the most desireable. While the section on rare cigars makes for an interesting read, this seems more like a book for cigar admirers rather than one for buyers and smokers. I had hoped to find a book to help me make informed buying decisions. I plan to buy the 3rd edition-used!"
3,really short,smithsonian's holdings are extensive and this book glosses over a few highlights. this sampling is not really a guidebook. It's advertising. just tantalizes and reveals practically nothing
2,I normally like Paul Rodriguez but this one?,"I will have to put this on my selling to someone else list ast I would never watch this again. It was his best stuff ""FOR ME"" perhaps someone else of this mentality might appreciate this more than me."
2,...,I saw this when it originally aired on fox back in the 90's. I was disappointed that the dvd does not contain all of the same footage as the fox special. There was supposed to be a lot of footage about the prison
2,Swing and a miss,"For being produced in ""95, this just feels so out of touch. It makes it very hard to watch today because he talks about Mike Tyson and Rodney King. I doubt I would have laughed much even when it came out, but it's just too out-dated to bring many laughs. Good comedians are timeless and remain funny 30 years later. I expected it to be far more entertaining judging by him being inside the prison, but the inmates don't even really seem amused. It's just forced and not very funny. Sometimes you find yourself being embarrassed for Rodriguez when his jokes fall flat. He's just an amateur, no wonder I haven't seen him since 1995."
1,bad bad comedy,"I bought it, I watched it, I trashed it. Why? Because I knew I would never watch it again. Very foul humor. Some parts were okay, but then other parts were... foul. Example, he had a skit that involved the suggestion of being sodomized by his father. Another skit was nearly as bad involving a proctologist. Need I say more? The only redeeming value this DVD has is in the bonus material where he tours the prison and interviews the inmates with the clear message to the kids to stay out of trouble and out of prison and to stay in school! He could of done that without the foul humor."
4,Rock the Cradle of Fire!!,"This missed novel was a thrill ride read.Written by the author who gave us the even better and action-packed mini-series - Force Recon, James V. Smith Jr. gives us what he knows - sweeping military action/adventure with high tech tools of the trade.With interesting good guys and evil enemies, this novel will surely entertain you. A must read.And his latest: Delta Force: Operation Michael's Sword - written under the psuedonym John Harriman, will turn those readers of Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy to hardcore Harriman fans.Check it out!"
5,Great read of discovery,This historical read was enlightening . I learned details about our fore-mothers and what they did daily on the wagon trains and taught each other over the very difficult trails. This is the factual presentation in the lines of the books by Gwen Bristol. Most interesting.
5,The Quilt That Walked to Golden,"The Quilt That Walked to Golden is an amazing look back at the memories and the hardships of traveling by wagon across the desert. It is a tale of women's courage and foresight. The copy I received was in excellent condition, well wrapped and delivered very much on time. I purcased the book through Amazon."
3,Entertaining and Enchanting,"This book takes me back to a magical time, when sovereign finance held potentates at bay, and when bankers were literally masters of the universe. In the absence of universal taxation by governments, raising funds for war and peace is the sole, nearly impenetrable domain of the sovereign banker. To say that the historiography of finance capital, or more appropriately, 'haute banque' is much, much better than Lord of the Rings and Rowling's tomes would be an unforgivable travesty."
2,Ok hand paddle,I bought these for my daughter who is 12 and swims competitively. They kept coming off no matter how tight we made them and we ended up having to get a different kind.
3,Great for small amounts of usage,Hand Paddles are great. These in particular are a great paddle. However too much usage of any hand paddle can really screw up the shoulder. Please know that when buying hand paddles.
4,Nice product but Sizing is Difficult,"Swim paddles are a great adjunct to any swimming workout. These are a quality set of paddles and come with tubing that you cut to custom fit your hand. The only problem is that the paddles are difficult to size. I have a large hand and I ordered the red paddle. It is almost too big. When ordering this product, order at least one size smaller than your hand size, and perhaps consider ordering two sizes smaller.kone"
4,Very good language cross reference,"I'm an avid Perl programmer who's wanted to do more with Python, but never seem to have the time to actually _do_ something in Python because I run out of time and end up doing it in Perl. This book has helped me get over that hurdle by providing a useful cross reference, so if you want to do X in Perl (with a perl code example that looks very typical), do Y in Python (with a plausible code fragment).I would have rated this book 5 stars, as it very clearly achieves its stated goal. Unfortunately it is absolutely riddled with minor typo's. Perhaps that will be fixed in a future edition, but for now it makes life a bit more difficult since you have to pay very close attention to what is in the book vs. what you might already know and correct the book where it is wrong."
2,Was this book even proofread?,"This book is a reasonable cross-reference, but it can't be trusted at all, for the simple fact that it has so many typos, spelling mistakes, and code samples with errors in that it's a dangerous book to give to a python learner. Bad show."
1,Piece of junk,"What a waste of money this was, the Patriots logo fell off after only a few uses, and I saw that it was merely glued on there. Probably cost the manufacturer $2 to make but they charged over $24 for it"
5,This book is irresistable,"I couldn't put this book down. There are 20 wonderful segments. Each one a great personal interest story, like something you might serendipitously discover leafing through the Sunday paper. Except these stories go much deeper, espousing the hard earned wisdom these women possess. I am for the better having read this book. And, I am inspired to become my own visionary and stand behind my dreams despite the many obstacles that will come along.I am very fortunate to be a male in this society. The challenges before me are far less than were for the DotCom Divas.I've heard this said before, that women possess great business sense. It's not until I read this book that I fully understand what this means."
5,If only it was available on DVD,"This is the best of VH-1's Storytellers/MTV Unplugged type recordings. If only they would release it on DVD. These men are more than singers, songwriters or troubadours. Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson are American icons. This spontaneous collection is a delightful and humorous testament to a tremendous body of work. It is a must have."
5,Excellent,"I promise this disc will make you a fan of both of these great musician-songwriters. Aside from their great stories, this performance is full of brilliant music-making. Willie is no hack on the guitar. The harmony in the two singers vocal work is just splendid. Even if you aren't a fan of country music, it is a rare treat to here these two men interact and perform some of the greatest songs of the genre. And amazing songs they are. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,For the True Fan....,"....and I am one -- a big-time Johnny Cash fan -- and I loved hearing these songs in an intimate setting. But, I don't think I'd recommend ""Storytellers"" as a place to start, either for new fans of Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson. Both artists have about 5 billion ""Greatest hits"" collections out there, and that's probably where to start. But, if you already own the essential tracks, and want one last chance to hear Johnny Cash sing some of his classic material live (given his illness it seems unlikely he'll ever tour again), this one's definitely worth the price of admission. BTW, I love the irony that Sony bought American Recordings, and Cash is now back in the Columbia Records fold after being unceremoniously dropped a decade ago......"
5,Simply A Classic,"This is one of - if not - the best of the VH1 Storytellers series. As the album's liner notes say, it is just two guitars, two barstools, and two masters of American music at perhaps their finest hour. This album is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of music, not just country. I recommend listening to this cd while sitting around a nice campfire with about two or three of your closest friends, a bottle of whiskey, and an ice chest of beer. It is quite an experience."
5,like,Good for the price. I don't mind the buzzing when focusing. A good step up from the kit lens 18-55mm. Highly recommend to buy camera body only without any kit lens if you haven't alredy.
4,Perfect wide angle lens.,"This is a great lens for what it does, and I have have used it to get some nice landscape images."
5,Canon EF 24mm f/2.8 Wide Angle Lens for Canon SLR Cameras,"Very happy with my Canon EF 24mm f/2.8 Wide Angle Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and so are others who have been viewing my pictures of the Aurora Borealis. Crisp and clear."
4,great inexpensive wide angle,"great inexpensive wide angle lens for those who can't yet afford an ""L"" lens. quick, quiet, great on a crop body."
4,Prefer the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM over this lens if speed is not important.,"This is a very good lens, but if you don't need the 2.8 speed, for half the money, you can buy the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM that offers the same performance and has USM.Both lenses exhibit fringing problems, and the color and contrast are not on par with the ""L"" class.I own both lenses (see my lens sharpness comparison test, http://www.creative-wedding-photography.com/LensTests/default.aspx, between the following Canon lenses: EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM,EF 24mm f/2.8, EF 50mm f/1.4 USM, EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM)."
2,"Soft wide open, bad flare","I compared this lens to a Sigma 30mm F1.4, the Canon 24mm was softer at the same f2.8 stop on both lenses. Neither lens is a great lens with the sun in frame, which I expected with the Sigma, since it is designed for speed. The Canon 24mm is not that fast of a lens at f2.8, so I thought I would use it as a sunset lens. The lens makes a horrible triangle shaped flare, along with other rainbow patterns. The lens also did poorly with shooting a skyline at night. I was disappointed, maybe stopped down it would look better, but that point your at f4, 5.6, 8, and there are plenty of lenses stopped down that look great. Also manually setting at infinity, wide opened, seemed slightly off the mark, I only shoot manual, since I am a professional and use a loupe to always check focus, but I was also hoping to have a lens I could pull out in a dark moonlit landscape and know for sure where infinity is. Might as well shoot though a lens cap."
5,A great book on biology,"Dr. Lewin's work has helped me understand biology and improve my understanding of the sciences. The design and figures in Genes are wonderfully clear, as is the general body of the text.Furthermore, his website at ergito.com has some great supplemental material on the important procedures of science and past experiments that have changed sciences.Between the Genes book and the subscription to Ergito, Dr. Lewin's work is a great opportunity to learn and expand your knowledge. I thought Genes VIII was great, and a good step forward from Genes VII."
4,Tank cover,"The product is exactly what we ordered and expected. It arrived in great shape, good packaging and very fast. No problems here at all."
3,DVD No Bluray??????,I bought the 2006 edition on DVD and it was great. I was waiting for this in Hi Def as the entire series was shot that way but alas it does not appear that it will be available. What gives. Is MLB losing it. They have not had Bluray editions of any of the past world series and I would have expected it for at least the last 3.So disappointed. Common MLB we what it in high deffinition!!!!!Oh the games were great and I want to see game 6 over and over again but I still want it on BluRay.Update: While there is still no BluRay Amazon did lower the price to 31.99 so I finally broke down and bought it. The games are great and for 32 I can live with DVD but come on MLB they should be in hi-def.
1,Why bother?,"I don't see why the most recent World Series can't be put on Blu-Ray and watched/enjoyed in High Def. I can understand the 1985 or 1979 World Series being DVD only. But with every World Series I've seen since I got an HD TV in 2005 being broadcast in HD, I see absolutely no reason to continue to sell an inferior product like this when better stuff is available.Personally, I don't like the Cardinals and found Game 6 to be the single worst sports moment since Cabrera and Bream beat the Pirates in 1992. But I think the fans of the Cardinals should be able to enjoy watching the game for years to come in HD. Not an old, out of date format."
5,Great Sports Set,"If you are a Cardinal Fan this is a must set, great games and excellent extra's. All baseball fans will enjoy."
5,2011 World Series,How can you not love rewatching the 2011 World Series. I would greatly recommend this to any St Louis Cardinals fans.
4,National League's Record World Series Champions,"I confess to being a lifetime Cardinal fan. Much baseball history and drama in this World Series is unmatched; the greatest example being (a) Cardinals overcoming a 1-3 deficit to win the final 3 games, plus (b) how the sixth (6th) game truly decided the championship."
3,nature sounds,I have passed this on to someone else because I did not find it useful for massage. That was my main purpose in purchasing the CD.
5,This album is where you go when you've heard everything.,"This album is fantastic. Most of us tire from the cookie-cutter music that is out nowadays, and this album is such a departure from that that its refreshing and soothing. Sometimes we just want to listen to ""pure"" music, no vocal accompaniment; to give us a chance to focus on the message of the MUSIC not the lyrics. I've listened to Tim Story ever since Search for Angels, and have bought Beguiled and The Perfect Flaw. Both of these are fantastic albums, but the addition of Roedelius and his electronic mastery make this album come out on top. If at first you listen to the album and think that it's ""haunting,"" think again. Listen again. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
5,A History of Cambodia,Perfect. The book arrived quickly and in the condition I was looking for. This book is being used as a textbook to learn more about the Cambodian culture and history. I will be visiting the area in a few months and so far the content has been very informative.
5,Excellent History of Cambodia,"The chapters on Pol Pot were the best I've read about the Whys and Hows of the killing fields. The professorial arrogance of Pol Pot and his constant blaming of everyone, other than himself, for the failure of his idealized policies. He apparently believed Cambodia would be a Utopia, once his progressive policy were properly implemented and all the dissenters and saboteurs were removed."
4,Conway Greatest Hits Volum 3,This is the best CD that he ever made and I could not find it in any store. I was so glad to finally be able to find it again.
4,Hope For The Hopeless,"The power of God's love is exhibited in the transformation of this individual, Jean Valjean. This tale follows his life, from the young convict that is broken and wretched, to the matured, changed man that has found restoration through the Lord. This is a wonderful story, but the original version is way too long with French history that probably goes on for hundreds of pages. Fortunately, this condensed version cuts out a lot of the unnecessary rambling history. I wish I had read this version originally because I just ended up skipping a lot of it anyway. Trust me, you won't miss anything."
1,Book not bound correctly,"Daughter got about half way through and found major binding problems, sections missing and bound in wrong order. Ended up purchasing another book elsewhere since she annoted the first up to the binding issue and needed those notes. More of a quality control issue than a topic issue but frustrating regardless."
3,Les Miserables,"It was a little difficult reading, but it gave me a basis for the movie that was recently made. I recommend another version if available."
3,kinda fiddly,This does work. I just found it was slower than using my flat bed scanner with slide insert. I could only do one at a time on this item whereas I could do five on the scanner.
4,To Joe Ferrio,"I have trouble seeing how you can honestly rate the second book in a series, if you haven't read the first. Because with the feeling in your words, or lack of more to say, if you had read the first book then you'd have never picked up the second had you not liked Mr. Harlan's writing style or alternate-history choice, and there would be a bad review from you listed on his first book, not the second. And, if you truly understood a little bit more about roman culture from the time period of the Empire, you would understand a little better how constricting a space that the author has to work with as far as dialouge at certain status levels of characters. The Roman Empire was built on the blood of warriors by the swords of warriors, not on the books of scholars from the thoughts of scholars.To Everyone Else - I thoroughly enjoyed it, for many reasons both historic and fantasy."
2,Harlan blew it,"By attempting to finish this second volume you experience the same frustrating sensation than with other promising alternative histories, notably Wingrove's ""Chung Kuo"". All the minor weaknesses present in the fist volume grow instead of being corrected. Vacilating characters, ad hoc elements and dei-ex-machina multiply, and the plot can turn to any direction within the following page. I think that Harlan gets in trouble trying to fit a custom Islam rising in the story, then breaking his ""contract"" with the readers (the one that goes: let's see what would happen without all these ""People of the Book"" around). Vocabulary and descriptions of epic and magical scenes still great, but a 500 page book can't be made with that only."
2,I don't think so...,"Alternative history is a dubious genre in my mind to begin with. History I can respect. Fantasy, which is fiction summoned from the author's imagination, is respectable too. But you have to be careful with alternative history, because it has an inherent cheapness that can be grating if not handled properly. In my opinion, this has happened here.Harlan's text is inconsistent, heavy in some places, thin in others, and his dialog is weak. These flaws make the careful plots and even the clever elements take on an ""oh, come on"" cast. It's a little like watching one of those old 50s costume epics with Tony Curtis--""Yonda is the castle of my fadda, the caliph."""
2,Not a great product for any reasonably heavy speaker!!!!!!!!,"Had a speaker fall of the wall, while still mounted to this bracket. Hit both studs and was in the weight capacity specified. I wouldn't reccomend or trust this product again.........."
3,The Captain's Vixen by Wanda Owen,"Lance had sailed the seas and won the wenches ever since he was a lad, and no woman had ever resisted his masculine magnatism -- no one but the luscious, jet-haired Elise. He vowed to possess her for he was bewitched by THE CAPTAIN'S VIXEN."
2,unless you have never read an animal book save your money,Crudely written and very much on the surface this book tends to serve up stuff we have already read about in other books or viewed in wildlife and animal documentaries. It is rather unstructered and wanders from one area to another without any apparent purpose. Its not very useful if you are deeply interested in animal behaviour. Its more like a script for a poorly researched TV show.
5,Playmobil is always fun,"My [...] year old loves all playmobil, but the fact that there is a baby in this set made it even better for her dollhouse. She loved it, and for the price, it was a great buy!"

1,POS......!!,"Received this as a part of a nice looking 5 piece wooden set...however, I spent sooo much time stropping it and it would NOT cut my hair. Well my hair is a bit wolverine,but i figure this is a straight razor, it should be able to cut anything..Not so. It finally did a little scrape today,but only after I've shaved down my face with my clipper and even then it wouldn't go clean...Big fail!"
2,razor,It was deceiving. the picture showed a wooden handle but it came with a cold silver cheap one. it was not very sharp.
1,Nominal at Best,"When just starting, I ordered this straight razor for practice honing. I thought, if lucky, I can shave with it. Well, the honing part worked out. Shaving? Not so good for that. Never could get an adequate edge. The metal is just not good enough in my opinion."
3,Not As Advertised,It was advertised as being properly sharpened. It wasn't as advertised.It required grinding to profile and then considerable honing to get it into useable condition.
2,Cheap quality for a cheap product.,This razor is a joke. Only comes sharp enough to cut vegetables. Don't advise using to shave until taken to be professionally sharpened or you plan on hours of precision grinding and honing yourself.
1,Blunt as a blunt thing!!,"Should have known from the low price. However, as a Brit I thought that maybe straight razors were popular in the USA and thus market forces made them cheaper. Nope! DO NOT try and shave with these razors. They are pretty, but unwieldy, heavy and badly made. They have loose hinges and ,ironically, sharper edges on the studs that hold the blade in place than on the blade itself. It would take professional work to put an edge on - but it wouldn't keep. Should have stuck to Dovo or something else with surgical steel."
3,Decent if you have general skill with shapening knives,"I'll start out by saying that this was my first straight razor. The purchase was prompted as a money saving effort as I've getting tired of paying for blades for my regular razors.I can't honestly say that I wouldn't buy this again but unlike some I'll state that this razor will work though not out of the box. If you're willing to take the time to properly hone the edge,(all I used was a regular sharpening stone) and strop the blade, then this will give you a workable shave. I would not recommend it for someone looking for a comfortable, closer shave, however."
4,fantastic,"works great, just don't get lazy and shave the left half of your face with your right hand... it doesn't get pretty."
1,Not for shaving,Straight razors can't be stainless steel. Stainless is too hard to sharpen at the fine level needed. Straight razors should always be non-stainless steel. Any stainless-steel straight razor is a pocket-knife in disguise.
2,Unsure about this one,I am new to straight razors. I am simply trying to trim my beard and mustache better than what electric clippers offer. This razor was extremely dull and difficult to handle. The rotation point was a little sloppy.
1,"""Shaving"" Razor","This product only looks cool. I'm new to shaving with a straight edge, thought I'd buy this for practice. After slightly sharpening it, it only cut one beard hair and scrapes off dead skin. I'm still trying to make it work, but alas no success. I wish I read the reviews before buying it. I'm unsure if it can serve you a purpose, from protection to shaving."
2,decent practice razor,"this was my first razor i ever used, but it didn't last very long after a few shaves. even with a proper stropping technique, this razor wouldn't stay sharp. For anyway looking to just practice proper strokes on their face or just starting out with shaving with a straight razor then get this razor.for a better shave with a straight razor invest some money into a higher quality straight razor like Dovo,Böker,or Dorko."
1,Not happy,"I dont even know where to startIts not ""razor sharp"" heck its not even butter knife sharpalso the blade is loose.it looks great but other then looks its crap"
1,Don't Buy,"I should have looked at the rest of the reviews before hitting the purchase button. I have been collecting vintage straight edge razors and wanted to purchase one that I could actually use. Lo and behold this is merely a mockup of what a razor should be. It does not cut hair in the slightest and is completely unsuitable for shaving. The only thing this is good for is peeling potatoes, which I haven't tried but I probably will."
1,This is not a Straight Razor,"For back of a better term, this is a Pocket Knife. The metal is not nearly strong enough to hold a true edge, nor does this razor come professionally sharpened. If you buy this razor hoping to shave your face you will be sorely mistaken.Please look to a professional retailer of wet shaving kit for more information on straight razors before purchasing one ANYWHERE."
1,I paid additional money (that I didn't have) and sat at home all day on a Saturday and waited for a package that DID NOT COME,"I paid additional money (that I didn't have) and sat at home all day on a Saturday and waited for a package that DID NOT COME. So, now I can't do my assignment that is due on Sunday night, which means that my grade and ultimately my GPA will be affected. Please do not let this happen to anyone else. My money is gone, my day is gone, and now my GPA will be adversely affected because I decided to deal with Amazon. I am not a happy customer!"

4,Plant Biography,"The video provides a good insight into Plant's musical career. Although not authroized by Plant himself, there are video excerpts from previous interviews with Plant along with interviews from various band members discussing his musical journey. It's informational if you're interested in knowing more about this artist."
5,THE Consumer-Grade Canon Lens to Get,"Dollar-for-dollar, this is the best consumer-grade Canon lens available. The focal-length makes it a great walk-around lens. The onboard Image Stabilization allow for crisp zoom shots without a tripod. If your hands shake a lot, this lens will help overcome that.On the flip side, I found the Macro option provides a really startling level of detail up close. I also found the combination of the f3.5 and Image Stabilization to be of great use in low-light, indoor shooting where flash is prohibited. It's a fairly fast-focusing lens, too.Even though I have upgraded to an L-series lens, the 28-135 is still a personal favorite. Considering it is 1/3 the price of an L-series lens, I cannot find a single fault with it. Anyone looking for a general-purpose lens for under $500 to compliment their Canon Digital Rebel, Rebel XT, 10D or 20D has found it here."
4,Working just fine,"I have had my lens now for about a year. To be honest, I haven't been blown away or anything. I have been using it on my xti(which is 5 years old now) and it has certainly been better than the kit lenses. The other day I put t onto a 7d and had much sharper cleaner pictures. Now I just have to save for a new body... dang.Pretty close focusing which is nice for some macro shooting. IS is pretty good to about 1/10. Just took some pictures in the sierras and they did come out pretty sharp. I would recommend this lens based on price if that is your concern. If you can swing a few more bills for an L than do it!"
5,One of my favorite lenses,"This is a wonderful, solid and clear lens. You will not hear bad things about this lens. IMHO if you had a wide angle and this lens, you'd be set."
5,Love love love this lens!!,"So this was the lens that came with my Rebel xTi about 2 years ago. I sometimes hear that kit lenses aren't all that great, but this one quickly turned into my favorite lens for the portraits that I take. It isn't ideal for the lowest of light settings, but I use my 50mm for that anyway, so it doesn't matter. This lens is sharp, fast, and not heavy, in my opinion. It's the best every-day lens for my needs, and I use it for everything unless I need my 50mm for something. Unfortunately, my lens was just scratched really bad, so it's now having to be put away until I can afford to get it fixed :( This is devastating to me and my business, but it will be one that I'm keeping, as it's definitely a lens worth having and not trading in or selling. It's a keeper!"
3,Disappointment,"I bought this lens about a year ago and I was surely disappointed with its performance. Images are not sharp at all, or at least not as expected. It is an o.k lens for snapshots."
3,Beware the small letters!,"When I decided to upgrade, I chose this canon 28-135 mm os from the small letter below the original advertisement. The one that says ""new:$319.95"".I thought that saving a hundred wouldn't be so bad. Well, first thing. This is a kit lens from a camera, taken and sent it in just a plain box, no warranty, no paper or any documentation whatsoever. After that, I realized that they advised about this in small print under the picture of the lens. The delivery was not definitely by UPS because UPS have you sign for any delivery and I found my box three steps from my door. I have a closed fence. Therefore, for my package to get there, it should be thrown over the fence. I have ordered other things from amazon and I've always been pleased with the service and the delivery. Next time, I'll buy strictly from them and not from any company that advertise through them."
2,Bad Lens,"Shame on Canon. I got this lens as part of a package when I bought a Canon 40D camera. I thought it would be great with IS and all, but I was sadly mistaken. The images are soft and the IS doesn't really help much. Fortunately I still had a Sigma 17-70mm lens that I got for my Canon 350D and I use this lens most of the time because I get the IQ that I am used to getting and the Canon 28-135mm lens is just a great disappointment. I wish I had spent the extra $200 on an alternate lens. I hope someone will want to buy this Canon lens from me. It's the only Canon lens I own and I am sorely disappointed with it. It is in a box collecting dust!"
5,Buyer Beware,"Yes, this is a great lens. But this seller is not stating whether this is a Canon USA or an import lens. At this price, I have to believe it is an import--no warranty in the USA. Hopefully this post will motivate the seller to indicate if it is gray market of Canon USA."
1,Worst useless lens,"After using this lens with other lens, I conclude thatthis is the worst lens I have ever used so far.And it is useless for crop sensor cameras. And I am wonderingwhy this lens came with Canon 7D as a bundle.Whenever I bring this lens out, I always regret.28mm is not wide enough. And the general purpose quality of28-135 mm is below the general quality.If I compare this lens with Sigma 17-70mm, Sigma is so muchbetter. Sigma has so much quality and the sharpness is reallyamazing. I normally don't realize it until I switch the lens withthis low quality Canon 28-135mm. Comparing with Tamron's18-250mm, within the same range, I think that Tamron isstill better. And I am wondering why you should use this lenswhen you use cropped sensor camera.And I you use an expensive full frame camera, there is noreason why you make your full frame camera a cheap point andshoot by using this lens."
4,Great all in one lense,If you could only have one lense with a Canon 20D this would be my choice. Great portrait lense and a very good moderate telephoto lense and wide enough at the other end to take good group shots. Of course the IS System is the other plus in this lense. I am speaking of Image Stablization.
5,Excellent Value,"I bought this lens in 2001 for my Elan IIe and now use it with my 30D. It is not up to the standards set by the ""L"" lenses but I have never been disappointed by it. My only critique is that on a crop camera the 28mm end is not really wide enough. This would be supplemented well by the 10-22 or the 17-40."
2,Used one for 5 years. Second one was defective.,"I've owned one of these for about 5 years and through usage it doesnt seem to focus from side to side. I've chalked this up to wear so I ordered another one but when it arrived the auto focus motor was frozen so I sent it back and rented a 24 to 70 L series lens from Lens Giant for a month. Wow, it is great but the price is 3 times the 28-135mm. The 28-135 is a good lens at f.8 and above at short distance. Not so good wide open with large groups such as wedding party altar shots. I'm still debating on what to by but I think it will be an L series."
2,Limited Life Span,"I loved this lens when I first got it, but after about a year of using it, it has peaked. I even sent it back to Canon - and paid over $100 - to have it calibrated and tweaked...and it's just not working right. I certainly used it a lot over the year, but a Canon lens should really perform longer than that. And after sending it back and spending the money to have it ""fixed,"" I'm done spending money on it. The focus is poor and the lens is not durable."
4,Excellent Walk About Lens,"This is a great walkabout lens. After using it for a while, it focuses fast and quietly, the IS works brilliantly. Complaints, it telescopes under its own weight after a while. You cannot pan with the IS. If you are using a 1.6 crop factor body (20D, 30D etc.) it is not wide enough. I have noticed that its color and contrast could be better."
2,"Good idea, bad results",I hate this lens. It lost the focus when stabilization is on. I don't recommend it.
4,"good, but not great","I think someone earlier reviewed this lens as ""a jack of all trades, but a master of none"". It's probably the most accurate way to sum it all up.I've used the lens for about 6 months with a T2i. I always feel like I need wider zoom when I'm shooting at 28, and the 135 never gets me ""close enough"". I can shoot indoors at decent quality, but I know I've see better and sharper pictures with other lenses on the same camera. The low ISO/high shutter pictures come out looking sharp, but could be sharper. The DOF is ok, but nothing that makes you say ""ooooh""."
2,There is a reason it is a kit lens.,"If you think that the $200 more for getting this lens in a Body+Lens kit package over a body only is worth it - you might be right. But paying anymore for this lens on it's own merit is a waste money! Mechanically this lens works decently, if you discount the zoom drift when the lens is pointed down. It has a poor feel. The images are inferior to other EF lenses in the same price tier. AC is poor, every focal length seems to have an issue: blur at 135mm, pincushion at about 55mm and up, vignetting apparent at low focals. It gets 2 stars just because it works."
4,Long time user,"I love this lens. I use it on my Canon XT. The range is great for that mid stuff that seems to always come up. The IS does allow me to shoot about one stop darker, as long as my subject isn't the one moving.I do notice a bit of chromatic shift when shooting in high contrast situations."
5,Great lens...,"Of course with any Digital SLR, most people would probably hate lugging around big heavy lenses. When I plan for a trip, I just pick out the lens that I would be using the most, and just keep that one on the camera. The picture quality is great. Used mostly for pictures my kids soccer games, it's quick and the quality is fine. I'm no expert in picture taking, but I know it does much better of a job than my wife's sony 10 megepixel-- especially with the zoom this one can do."
5,Stellar,Great lens for portraits. The girlfriend was happy with this gift. Started using it right away and the photos came out great
4,Lens creep kills this lens!,"Other than the lens creep I'd rate this lens a 4.5/5. Yes this isn't ""L"" lens quality but it's damn close. My major disappointment with this lens is where it begins at 28mm. I wouldn't consider it a perfect ""walk-around"" for that reason but that may be a personal preference. It's also the same reason why I didn't take this lens on a recent trip of mine. I'd prefer most of my lens's to start at a 24mm (at least). That is usually why I use a 24mm prime for candids and most uses. If this was an 18 or 24-135mm then I'd for sure give it a 5 star review. Otherwise, I think it's a great all around lens with minimal limitations. Overall I highly recommend this lens. Great IQ with great versatility. Prices are good here on Amazon so why not. Enjoy!"
5,Outstanding Lens!!,"I couldn't be happier with this lens. Image quality with this lens is superb, bokeh is very smooth. Auto focus is very fast and reliable, and image stabilization makes getting a clear shot easy, even with a moving target. I'm using this lens on a Canon Rebel XSi, and it is now my primary lens. It is far superior to the kit EF-S 18-55mm IS lens, and is a perfect intermediate lens between the kit lens and my EF 70-300mm IS USM telephoto zoom lens. If you need something with greater reach than the kit lens, but you don't want to spend more than $500, buy this lens. You won't regret it."
2,There are better ways to spend your money.,"I'm an amateur moving to pro so my review is geared towards folks that are looking for a medium-wide zoom lens. There are some things I've learned over the past couple of years. 1) Prime lenses are always going to look sharper and have greater saturation than zoom lenses. 2) The Canon 28-135mm has lost a lot of perfectly focused shots for me.It's a pretty cheaply constructed lens with a lot of dust getting inside of the lens (no amount of self-cleaning can remove it, must be sent to Canon). I'm now building up a small arsenal of prime lenses and shopping the 17-40mm as my walk-around."
5,Great everyday lens for DR,"After using this lens for the last nine months, I regret not purchasing it the day I ordered my digital Rebel two years ago. The image stabilization feature is better than advertised and dramatically increases the ability to shoot hand held in low light or with small apertures. This lens is sharper, focuses faster, and offers a wider range of zoom than the kit lens that comes with the DR , and although larger and heavier, is a great everyday lens that stays on my camera 85% of the time. If you are considering purchasing a DR for everyday photography (family, vacations, etc.) do yourself a favor and upgrade to this lens, it is extremely versatile and worth every penny."
5,Perfect walk around lens,"If you own the XT or 20D, this is the perfect walk around lens! It doesn't get particularly wide and it doesn't zoom very large, but with the 1.6x crop factor, the zoom is better than expected. Imaging is clear and precise and the image stabilization feature is fantastic. The macro function isn't overly impressive, but it's solid. Other lenses will focus much closer, but this isn't meant to be a specialty lens. It's a jack of all trades lens that excels at everything it was designed for. You simply can't go wrong with this lens."
5,"Excellent general, carry-about lens","Have had this lens for a couple of years now and have used it in several countries traveling. It is an excellent overall lens. Usually carry my 70-300mm lens with me as well when traveling but 95% of the time use this one alone. It provides excellent quality photographs with either my XTI or XSI and has not failed me. Reasonable weight, provides excellent clarity. Highly recommend it for an over-all lens to use as your primary lens."
4,Perfect complement to a 50 f1.4,"I have an XSi and the 50 f1.4 and have been searching for a zoom thatcould serve as the one lens that I leave on the camera body most, ifnot all the time. The 50 f1.4 still performs better indoors in lowlight, but the 28-135 zoom gives me freedom to vary my compositionsmore when there is sufficient light, especially outdoors. As such,this two-lens combination is serving me well for my focal length andenvironmental needs. Nowadays, I keep the 28-135 on my camera most ofthe time and only use the 50 occasionally as needed indoors. Twofinal notes ... first, you can purchase the 50 plus the 28-135 formuch less than the 17-55, but still have the IQ and a lot of range,and second, the 28-135 is much better balanced for the XSi than the17-55 in my opinion. I am very pleased with the 28-135 as a qualitywalkabout lens to complement my 50 prime."
3,okay lens,"It's an okay lens for a travel lens in that price range. The range pretty much covers everything I need to do on trips, but I now prefer to just take my EF-S kit lenses with me (18-55 and 55-250). The 28-135 is quite soft, has a bit of zoom creep and has some difficult focusing in low light or indoors (just focus manually then). It still takes nice pictures and I usually stop it at f8 if I really want it to be sharper. I prefer to do as little post-processing as possible and I find the two kit lenses produce better and sharper results for me for around the same price. Bear in mind, the build of the kit lenses isn't quite as solid and heavy as the 28-135, but I don't mind less weight on the camera."
2,Very Dull and Lifeless Images,"I bought this lens in hopes that it would be an upgrade from what I had been using. I have had the lens for about 6 months and have yet to be impressed.The images are very blurry and always need sharpening in photoshop or other program. Then you have to buy a lens hood seperate??? crazy!!!If you can hold out and save a few hundred more for an L lens, then do so. Choosing to settle for this lens will only dissapoint you!"
3,not impressed,"This lens came rattling in a plain box, wrapped in bubble wrap. Focus and contrast was not as sharp as I expected - perhaps the poor packing/shipping had some effect on this or perhaps it is a bad copy. It makes me wonder if this lens wasn't the same one that a previous customer returned, since I remember reading a review that mentioned the lack of box and manual."
3,Canon EF 28-135mm IS USM,"Bought this used, so there was a somewhat surprising amount of dust trapped within. Second time using this lens I got an 'error o'1' message, had to remove the lens and swith it out and missed a touchdown play (I do high school football photography) Put the lens back in and it worked ok, but now I don't trust it. First time shooting with a used lens; I think I will save up for new lenses going forward. I also use a Canon 100mm prime f2.0 lens for night games and while it doesn't get strong close-ups, it does a great job if I stay near the action on the sidelines."
3,focus problem,It has auto focus problem on my 5d2. Sometimes it try and try and can not get the focus forever......
4,Excellent range for the price,"This lens has a large focal range, combined with a 1.5' minimum focusing distance.AF is quiet and relatively fast. I've noticed a tendency for my lens to front-focus slightly at the telephoto end where I use it most.Image quality is good, with moderate distortion at either end of it's zoom range. I've seen some CA at high contrast edges, but this is generally hard to see unless you're looking for it.What really makes this lens useful to me is the low MFD. I've been able to generate impressive bokeh by moving the camera close to the subject. This has worked well for portraits of my son for example."
4,Canon EF 28 -135 mm lens,I purchased this lens when I purchased my Rebel XTi camera body. I have nothing to compare it to; however it has worked well for me. Previously I was using a point and click camera. I have not been disappointed in the quality of the photos I have taken. I have been using this lens for over two years.
4,Great Lens,So far I have really enjoyed using this lens. I'm still playing around with it and have a lot to learn but I've been super happy with it so far
4,"Good deal for the money, not wide enough on DSLRs","This is a good deal for the money. Image Quality is good, zoom range is great, build quality is decent (some wobble still). IS actually works correctly.Now in the age of DSLRs, this lens is probably not wide enough for general purpose walk around use. It also uses the ""old style"" IS which cannot be used in panning mode. This lens also doesn't have as great of IQ as L glass such as the 24-105L, 17-40L and 24-70L, namely lacking in color and contrast. Also, f5.6 at the long end is somewhat dim."
3,Ok lens but it has problems,"I recieved this lens and was told it was out of a Canon 60d kit. I only used this lens around the house for the first week. Upon going out and shooting photos, I noticed that I have to hold the camera steady and facing forward or else the lens will zoom all the way out if the camera faces the ground or the lens will slam into the body if zoomed out and I lift the camera up.I have multiple Canon lenses and have never had this problem."
3,zoom creep,this is the kit lens that came with my canon 7d...i just had this lens for a week and uuugggghhhh i got some zoom creep issues already...hhhmmm...did i just have a bad copy of it or it's life is just super limited....??
5,EF 28-135mm,"A good outdoor general purpouse lens. I think it's a bit too slow for indoor use, but then I have the 28mm f/1.8, 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.8 for that purpose. Good macro feature. Works will with the Rebel XTi, which it ""acts"" like a 50-200mm lens. Good for serious amateurs or those thinking about going pro. This should be the only outdoor lens you'd ever need -- unless you really need to reach out and touch something a long way off or are a super pro."
5,Great upgrade from kit lens,"A very nice upgrade from the kit lens that comes with the rebel xt or xti. Focusing is fast and accurate also the ring allows you to tune the focus when needed. Lens is not to heavy, I spent 2 days walking around disneyland with this lens and had no issues. Image stabilization is a nice feature to reduce camera shake but it does not stop action in low light, only a faster lens will do that(f/2.8 or f/1.8).. I almost always have this lens mounted on my camera, the kit lens is history."
3,Not impressed at all.,"I was going to replace Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM Standard Zoom Lens that i have on my Rebel XT with this one...right after opening the box i have noticed how cheap it feels/looks (honestly i was shocked i just paid $416.00 for it). Then i took some 200+ shoots with it and all I can say is it's an OK Lens, no more. Considering it's current price of $400 + i sent it back for a refund and will stick the 28-105mm i have purchased along with the Digital Rebel XT in 2005 and it's about half of the price but without Image Stabilization which by the way isn't impressive on this lens anyway."
2,If you want sharp pictures this is NOT the lense,Great range and the USM provides quite and fast auto focus. The IS works well.While the lense takes sharp photos at extreme zoon at all other settings the pictures were fuzzy. Not sure if its bad glass or a problem with auto focusing.Not worth the money but it may be that I got a bad copy of the lense like so many others here have.I wanted this lense to work but ended up returning it.Had some issues returning it but as always Amazon worked with me and the lense is on its way back.
2,Good not great,"Doesn't shoot true to the view finder on my Canon 30D. Useless in low light conditions, I end up0 using my kit lens. I prefer my 120 telephoto for portraits."
5,"a great lens, despite the price - worth the money","I'm a high school student and this lens is a little pricey, but I have found that this lens was totally worth the money. Based on the amount of time it spends on my camera alone, this lens was worth the money, but when you factor in the image quality, the good focal lengths, and the image stabilization, it becomes apparent that this lens was more than well worth the money. All focal lengths are sharp, and the zoom range is perfect. 28 is wide angle enough for most situations, and except for when you're shooting sports or wildlife etc., 135 is plenty of telephoto. Along with this, I have the 70-300mm IS (without diffractive optics) lens (which was another $400ish) and that covers almost the entire range one might need. This lens lives on my camera (VERY VERY VERY rarely comes off) and is terrific. If you don't have $1500 to spend on a lens, this is a high quality lens, for a moderate price and is highly recommended."
3,It's OK,"This lens is alright, but that's about it. It offer's a very nice zoom range but being a kit lens you don't really expect L quality. The build quality is alright, but it felt like with a little effort I could probably take off the rubberized zoom ring. It focuses quite fast and images compare to that of other low-end lenses in the category (18-55, 55-200, 18-200)"
4,"Good zoom lens, IS really helps","I really enjoy using Canon prime lenses - have a 20, 35, 50, and 85 so far. But when I need a zoom lens - say for a public event and I can't be jumping around to re-frame - I take this lens. It takes good shots (I'm an amateur) and the IS really works.On a cropped digital camera like the Rebel XTi, the 28mm setting isn't a wide-angle. So if you're going traveling, you will probably want to supplement this (e.g., the Canon 20mm prime which is amazingly good but costs as much as this lens does)."
4,Great Everyday Lens... for Pro's or Enthusiasts,"This lens is worth the money, or buying as a kit option. I would give it 5 stars, but there are couple of minor issues that bring it down.Pros: USM. Quick focus. Great images. Pretty good range between wide field and moderate zoom at a great price point. My favorite single travel lens if I don't feel like switching lens all day long or carrying multiples.Cons: LENS CREEP. After a while it happens to a lot of these. There are ways to fix it if you are knowledgeable. Dust gets in pretty easy but not enough to degrade your images or even notice.Overall, I think it is the best single carry lens on the market."
5,Super Lens,I bought this lens as a 'walk around' lens and it does the job superbly. Solid construction. The macro function works nicely as well. It is tack sharp and focuses fast. The IS is a great feature and sure helps old shaky guys like me!! For a mid priced walk around it just doesn't get any better than this lens. You can't go wrong with it.
3,good walk around lens for a budget,"I originally reviewed this as a consumer who had no idea about photography. Now I have some knowledge and have upgraded to the 24-70 2.8, and this lens now sits as a in case my lens dies emergency.Overall, for a beginner on a budget, this is a good lens. Way better then any kit lens. The zoom ring is loose and slides around very easily when you do not want it to. If you want a narrow depth of field (when only a small amount of the image is in focus) and you are on a budget, get the 50 1.8 lens instead. But if you are looking for a good quality walk around lens this is great for a beginner or casual photog.pros- good quality lens for pricecons- does not open up enough, loose zoom ring"
3,Just received,"I just received this lens. Shipped UPS. Came in a plain white box with a sticker on it that said Canon. One wrap of bubble wrap. The lens rattles when you pick it up and move it back and forth. No manual. From Digital Pavillion Electronics. We shall see how it works, but I'm not very excited by the state of this thing so far."
3,Not impressed-even for the price...,"After 4 weeks, 2 of which in the Caribbean, I returned this lens to Canon in NJ for repair and re-alignment.Pictures are too blurry, and autofocus seems to be fast but inaccurate (forward focus, very noticeable).Should be back within a week from now, so I'll update my review then. Thank goodness I had my 50mm 1.2L with me!I think this may be the last non-L lens I buy.Bogus Exception"
3,Average lens with lots of technical issues,"I bought this lens to serve as one lens fits all needs. It definitely served the purpose. However, this lens has inherent flaws - poor motor that makes the lens not to focus quickly, lack of sharpness in the image and the sound during focus etc. I was suffering to get a good sharp picture with this one. I will definitely discourage getting this lens as there are better ones out there - even from Canon. Although I read several discouraging reviews before I bought this, price was the attractive feature at that point.Sadly, at the end, my digital SLR camera with this lens was stolen by Chennai Airport baggage handlers in India during my last trip.I am planning to get a new camera and a lens - definitely not this lens."
3,Not that good for the money,"For a lens of this price with the Cannon name you would think the zoom feature of the lens would hold in place where you zoom to. When shooting down or tilting the camera down the lens zoom feature slides forward on it on, it doe's not have any friction to hold it where you set the zoom. Very annoying!Quality of the glass and other features are good. (pro photographer) See studio323.net for samples of work."
3,Old designed lens,It is an old designed lens. For today it is unsatidfied in its mechanical performance. The lens is very easy to creep. I am tired to deal with it. So I have to return it.
5,Must have lens,This is a great lens. A little heavy for all-day carry around but the functionality and great pics make it worth it.
5,"Picked it up by accident, LOVE IT!","I bought this cd from a music store in Dallas that was going out of business. I bought it because I saw the parental advisory on it and thought the album art looked cool. I saw the name of a few songs like "" make me suffer "" and "" sucking spikes"" and I knew I had to have it. The first lick on the first song and I was sold. THIS CD ROCKS! You have got to see the tatoo on this chicks back that is shown on the inside cover! wow! Her voice rocks and she says "" you f' ed with the wrong girl "" on track 09 and says "" dont f with me "" haha if you like angry chick singers you will LOVE this cd. ""f"" anyone that doesnt like it or gave it bad reviews! hahah that is what she would say! I bet amazon wont print this review! hahahahaha"
2,They had potential but...,"..wasted it. I'm pretty sure Spike 1000 broke up, you don't hear from them much anymore. One problem they had was their tremendous arrogance. I saw interviews with them in which all four of them proclaimed what a gift they where to music and how superior they where to other bands at the time. Another problem is that a heavy band with a female lead vocalist can either disregard the novelty or go along with it, Spike 1000 did the latter. Finally, this band plays boring boring nu metal, with some hints of held-back creative talent. The vocals are really strong, she can hit some cool notes and has a sexy yet strong vocal presence. Yet her lyrics are all about ME! Make ME Suffer, etc. Typical ""I'm pissed and angsty"" lyrics venting anger at some anonymous ex-boyfriend or something.Anyways, so long Spike 1000. Sorry you wheren't as amazing as you claimed."
2,Just another dud in the scores and scores of nu-metal bands,"This CD is really nothing original. Take about 5% Slayer, and then 95% other nu-metal bands that came before them, and you have Spike 1000. Not a good sign. The only thing they take from Slayer is a level of heaviness. This is also not that great on this CD... No solos, no memorable riffs, not anything worth your money. I don't know how SO MANY TERRIBLE BANDS like Spike 1000 get record deals. Probably because the record labels know they can make money off of gullible little kids who want to get into the newest music. It's just sad. Don't buy this piece of [*] and look somewhere else, and DEFINITELY not in the nu-metal area."
5,This song never grows old!!!,I saw one of the previous posters write that this song gets old after a while. I have to strongly disagree! This is one of the greatest dance songs ever! It still gets me jumping out of my seat after hearing it dozens of times.
3,Gets old after a while,"This is a good filler song. The airwaves killed this song, and due to this, it gets old real quick."
1,What the heck...?,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE THE SIMPSONS!!! But to me, it's just ridiculous how they keep changing the release date for the Season 3 DVD. Yes, this was when everything started getting good with the show and yes, it's twice as funny as Seasons 1 & 2 combined! There are other FOX programs on DVD that are already beyond Season 8 for crying out loud! Why can't they just make it already?! I don't care about the commentary! I just want the episodes! But no! We SHOULD be at the release for the Season 5 DVD by now! But they just HAD to change the date ALL the way to August?! WHY?!!! Why couldn't we just get the release date for July? ... I give the T.V. show 5 stars but ZERO for the DVD due to that this was supposed to be out a long time ago."
4,The Simpsons,"The reviewer for Amazon.com said this DVD demonstrates why the Simpsons are ""by a large margin"" the best television show ever. He is wrong. While the Simpsons were great, it can't compare to Seinfeld. Seinfeld was the perfect sitcom, there will never be anything like it again. And unlike the Simpsons, the brains behind Seinfeld knew when to quit. But the Simpsons were still a great show and this DVD showcasing their glory years is a great buy."
1,1 star,I really dont think this movie is one star I think it is 5 star but everyone always skips over the 5 star reviews because there are so many. I love the simpsons there sweet if I were you I would definatly get this dvd.
1,You gotta be kiddin me,"C'mon, YOU PEOPLE LIKE THIS ...??? THe simpsons is one the most boring and depressing shows of our time... I used to like this show, when i was in 4th grade, since then ive developed a sense of humor. If you want an actually FUNNY cartoon show dont waste your money on this worthless junk, ... and be liberated from crappy TV FOREVER!!!"
4,Great show,"The listing looks great. Unfortunately, they are dismally slow at releasing this. It's pitiful that we have to wait a year per season.Sorry folks, that is just plain dumb. Every other TV show out there is realeasing DVDs earlier, why can't Simpsons?Oh well, I have most of this stuff on videotape anyway. And who needs the commentary? I just want to see the episodes."
1,Decent,The disc skips on the first show and most of the CD's are scratched....It was put up as like new..I seem to feel it is far from it..not happy with it at all .....hope the rest of the dics play better then the first!!! thank you
5,So many good things about this!,"My goodness is this set better than Season 2...and I don't just mean in the quality of the episodes. Although sure...the characters are better drawn and the jokes are more humorous, but the technical specs of this set over season 2 are way better. For example, gone are the stupid spinning heads that you would have to click throught to finally get to the episodes. In it's place is an ACTUAL main menu that, when you click on a choice (Play All, Episode Selection, Audio Options, and Special Features), something happens to the family on the couch. Whether it be the lights going out, the floor opening up to feature a Simpson BB(B)Q, or even a direct take on the Matrix. Even better is that it's all random so even if you click on the same thing more than once, you won't see the same animation every time.Overall, this is a really great set that shows The Simpsons when they really began to take off. I can't wait for Season 4!"
5,"Of course it rocks, it's The Simpsons!","I will keep this review short. Buy this dvd, the show is the best, and the dvds are great. The only problem is that they are coming out too slowly. I am fifteen now and I don't want to be thirty by the time all the seasons are on dvd. Other than that they are perfect additions to anyones dvd collection."
5,A Preemptive Knockout!,"Yes, I'm aware that I'm rating a DVD that hasn't been released yet, hence the review's title. The 3rd season's shows represent the creme-de-la-creme of America's beaux-artes: The Simpsons.Suffice it to say that the characters are all there, fully fleshed-out: billionaire archetype Monty Burns, lovelorn Waylon Smithers, and of course, Clan Simpson.The only detraction is the prolonged wait involved between DVD releases. While newer shows are released almost immediately, a classic like The Simpsons is left to collect dust on storage-room shelves. It's a crime against humanity I tells ya!"
5,The Simpsons - The Complete Third Season DVD,"who ever disagrees with not putting out this dvd is stupid, I have the first season and the second witch I Loved and I am prepared to buy all of the simpsons seasons. The third season is personally one of my favorites and if it dosent come out I will be outraged. Around thirty of my friends have bought the first and the second and also want all of the seasons. Whoever read this write more reviews tellin the American people to sell allof the seasons!!!!!!!"
4,Great Stuff,"The third season of the simpsons keeps the laughs comin. These are halarious episodes that we all remember, not too old but they arnt the newsest ones, although sometimes it seemed like it while i was watching them. These also have the PLayall feature which i love so i can just sit down and put the Simpsons on for hours. It is some "" GOOOOOOOODDDDDD WATCHIN"" ;)Enjoy these!"
3,The Simpsons - The Complete Third Season,The only problem is that we ordered a brand new product and we received a used product. Also the booklet that accompanies the product was not there. The great thing is that we received a 50% credit on the purchase.
4,The Waiting [Stinks]!!!!,"Ok, I'm with paul...I am absolutely disgusted with the fact that we are basically getting one season per year! I am so bloody mad about this i almost don't want to buy the third season!! And that is saying a lot considering this was the first season that the Simpsons became really funny. I would urge every true Simpsons fan to write or email or call FOX and tell them to get their [act] together--and by the way...the four stars are for the episodes contained within and not the behavior of the people at FOX."
3,It's okay,"You know I really love this season but it isn't as good as the 1st, 2nd, or the 4th. I t was pretty boring."
3,"Good, but not great.","I think season three is a very good season, but not as good as season two. For example some of season three's episodes are kind of dull like ""Lisa's Pony"" and ""Black Widower"", now Black Widower is a good episode but it's not simpsons style. On the other hand season two is a great season with funnier episodes like ""The Way We Was"", ""One Fish,Two Fish,Blow Fish, Blue Fish"", ""Dead Putting Society"" and ""Dancin' Homer"". So if you're going to chioce just one season to get i would recomend season two, but if your a hard core simpsons fan liek me i recomend getting all three seasons so far."
3,You're making me high,"This is one of the best seasons by far. Maggie starts getting more air time. Marge keeps it real. If you're a big fan of the band Jigsaw, you may want purchase this season of the Simpson's."
3,"5 stars for the content, 0 stars for the release schedule","Along with most of you, I am a huge fan, and so enjoyed the content of this set a great deal. Unfortunately, I must take issue with the release schedule for these sets. One a year is simply insulting to the fans. We all understand the economics of revenue scheduling, but as a fan, it is frustrating to think that the current season will be released around 2015, give or take a year.To recap, the content of the Simpsons releases is great, but please join with me in writing letters to 20th Century Fox to express your displeasure with their release schedule."
5,Best Season,"This season features a new main title screen that is actually user friendly. No more having to click the select button ten zillion times (okay, maybe it was three times) to get to the main title screen after inserting the disk. The main screen show up like normal. Also, I don't think you could do this on the 1st and 2nd season, but now you can play all episodes on the disk automatically without going back to the title screen. I hope the publishers keep this system for the fourth seasons and beyond.You can read the other comments on the episodes, but this is must own for all Simpson's followers."
5,Awesome product for The Simpsons fans,"From the 4 seasons now released, this is one of my favorites. This season includes some extras, featuring Butterfinger TV commercials. This season includes one of the most hilarious ephisodes from The Simpsons. The DVD menu is well organized and is easy to select extra features from it. Different from the other seasons now released, this one includes some audio options for foreign languages. Since I am not a native English speaker I have enjoyed the Spanish audio option. It includes the original translation from Mexican version."
1,tyco totem rack,"This product does not function well. It is difficult to use, poorly balanced and awkward. I hoped it would be useful to transfer rods to boat and organize them in the boat. It is difficult to load the rack, difficult to remove them from the rack and generally useless."
5,Great product,An easy way to carry multiple rods and keep them from tangling. Will carry some decent size salt water rods.
3,Light but easily dented,"Do not order this product with other hard/heavy items - it gets dented in shipping. I ordered this along with a book to save on shipping. It comes in a plastic cover, and was shipped in the same box with the book, which was not individually packed. When I opened the package, I found the book had dented the wok lid in a couple of places. If you are ordering this with another item, make sure it is a soft toy.The lid itself is very light, has a small wooden knob to hold it, and is easy to use and does the job. But at $14, it is a tad expensive. It was neither sturdy, nor well packaged."
3,Shiney aluminum wok lid with just a few caveats,"Nice looking, light, and shiny aluminum lid. The knob handle screws on tightly with a locking head screw. Note, twist the knob to tighten and just hold the screw with your thumb or, preferably, a screwdriver. Also, this lid is only 13.5in in diameter so it will fit just inside of your 14in wok. Not a problem, but it states (or stated) 14in as the diameter in description when it is not; so, -1 star for inaccurate description. My lid arrived with the top dented because Amazon packed it in a box that was not deep enough; so, -1 star for Amazon packaging. Though, it is just aluminum so it's not difficult to just bend/pound back into the correct shape, which is what I did. Other than that, perfect lid to contain all that fragrant steam from your 14in wok."
2,Missing parts!,"I have now had to return two of these in a row after opening the box to find it missing parts. For an item that only has 3 parts, I'm dumfounded that they can't seem to get me a complete one. The first one had no handle included at all. The second one has the handle, but no screw or bolt to attach it with. Since there is no way to get just the missing part, I have to continue to roll the dice and hope that on the third try they can get me a complete product. I seem to recall seeing another review saying the same thing. I'm generally pleased with Amazon, but this is a major quality control issue!"
3,"Review of ""Carving and Boning like an Expert""","This book deals with the endangered art of carving. Its central issue revolves around this tradition and the tome gives you the expertise to handle all kinds of meat products.The volume is organized in six basic chapters: foul, beef, lamb, pork, veal and seafood (fish and lobster).It also comes with illustrations to help you position yourself in the place of the carver.My opinion is that this book delivers the goods for those who want to get the most out of their meat."
4,Who doesn't LOVE Family Guy!!!,"If I didn't LOVE the Family Guy, I might complain about this game... lol The game itself isn't very consistent... you fly through one level in one shot, then it takes two days to get through the next and over and over... The gaming is fun but the big bonus is definately that you get to hang with your favorite characters... (although not EVERYONE is in the game).For Family Guy fans this is a must... For everyone else, rent it first to make sure it's worth your purchase."
1,Annoying,"Title says it all basically. I got pretty far in the game then it froze up and when I went to play it again I had to start over, not only did this happen once it happened twice. Needless to say I gave up on it because I got tired of the Brian parts, very annoying. Definately not worth buying, it's worth renting to entertain for about an hour or 2."
2,VERY Glitchy...,"as the title says, it's quite glitchy and the only people that would enjoy it are true die hard fans, and not for the gameplay. Could of, and should of, been done alot better."
2,OVERRATED,bad camera and slugish controls are par for the corse for this game the non sequiter mini games that pause the action are porly exicuted and the whole thing just looks and feels wrong I'd give it only half a star if i could
5,Great Game,"even though i only played this once (and beat it), i enjoyed it very much. the plot lines are good, and it has just enough difficulty in order for it to be fun!! highly recommend this to fans!!"
1,"This game is bad, even for fans","I love the show, but this game is just awful. Got it on sale, thought it would be a laugh, should have read the reviews first. It's frustrating, annoyingly repetitive, and even though there's some kind of story going on in each set, I have absolutely no interest in seeing it through to the end. Sad, because the show is so great, they could have really done something interesting with it. Unfortunately, it feels like they just slapped the characters and some repetitive jokes on a very average group of things we've all seen a hundred times already going back to the original Nintendo. Not nostalgic, lazy. And the gameplay itself is extremely frustrating, the whole thing very poorly designed. Whoever designed this needs to be fired. Out of a cannon. Into the Sun. Seriously, you should be ashamed of yourselves, which for this show is saying something. I'm sure the manatees must not have been pleased."
2,Don't waste your money,"I'm sure there are worse games out there , graphic- and playability-wise, but I have to agree with my headline here when I say this game sucks.I traded it in after owning it for about a month. I would recommend against buying this game unless you an find it free or for under $3.00, but then the issue is that it's just plain a waste of time.I have to endorse what some other people have formerly stated: that you're better off just picking up a whole season and watching it. I'd have to recommend the Season 4, Volume 4 Box Set, which is my personal favorite.Overall: The game's pretty sucky, don't buy it period."
1,Not a lot there,This game is not creative or challenging. It does not offer a lot of thought and becomes quite boring and is now gathering dust on a shelf.
4,Family Guy,"enjoyed game, some areas confusing as to what steps to take to make it through obstacles. Son completed in one day."
1,Blah,"Reading the reviews below really gives you a good idea. The graphics in the animated sequences are horrible and the actual gameplay is irratating. Basically its elementary moves over and over; but the way the graphics are set up make even simple tasks impossible unless you try over and over (see Stewie's jump levels). It really reminded me of the old Simpsons games in the early 90's, so dissapointing. Not even worth playing."
2,Strangely hard!,"Just adding to what others have already mentioned - the Peter levels are insanely hard, it's extremely repetative which just makes this game very frustrating. Fun for the Family Guy fans, but don't buy it - rent it.Ps - why are there no cheat codes for this game?? (yes, it's that hard!)"
2,good game gone bad,"for the first couple of hours, this game is great. most of the gripes have been said by other reviewers but honestly after a while of playing this game i was so frustrated i wanted to punch whoever made it. boring would be the appropriate word to describe peter and brian's levels and some of stewie's levels are so hard that you have to do each about 15 times to just pass through. if you're a die hard fan of family guy, and if you have extra money to blow on family guy stuff, go for it... if not do yourself a favor and don't buy this game."
2,Disappointing,"There is only 2 sentences about the canary song bird which is the most notable thing about these Islands, and even that information is completely wrong. On page 239 it states the wild canaries don't sing! How ridiculous especially when the bird got exported to other countries because of its spectacular song (as with all song birds, it sings to attact mates and defend its territory). Canaries do NOT need to be caged in order to sing or taught to sing as stated. There is only 2 pages in this book devoted to the Flora and Fauna of the Islands. This is also disappointing.Way too much emphasis placed on hotels and restaurants unless one plans to visit and do nothing but stay at a hotel and eat."
5,BEST FLEA PROTECTION -- BEST PRICE,My vet suggested this product and I have used it 5 years now. I have a host of outside cats. Inside 1 dog and 2 cats.The key is to spray everywhere the animals go. Spray all their toys and inside every closet. This breaks the life cycle of the flea. It will get the flea eggs so they don't hatch out.This past summer in Texas has been bad for fleas. I treated with this product and then at then called in a professional for advice. The bug guy couldn't believe I called about a flea problem.--- He came a week after I sprayed and there was no sign of fleas. I decided to keep using this and forget the pro.A spray treatment seems to last 6 to 8 weeks depending upon the flea season. The can lasts a long time. Amazon merchant usually has a better price than my vet.
3,kitty fleas,"did not control problemBut had carpet professionally cleaned @ this pointheard from veterinary in this area pets are becomming immune to some of these products like 'Siphotrol' in S.W. TexasI live in area where there are ducks and birds where they can transfer easily to my pet (un)fortunately, so I must be on high alert."
4,Great item!,Siphotrol Plus is amazing! It killed the fleas and eggs within minutes of spraying. The smell is not too overpowering and leaves soon after spraying. I highly recommend this product.
3,The end After all the stupid storylines,"The show lasted 14 seasons.All fans remember the start of the show, the good storylines and characters.They let the show go on too long.How stupid the storylines got.Here we go with the last season. They got rid of Miss Ellie and Lucy AGAIN for the entire season. We see Clayton a couple of times.For the last episodes we get to see Sue Ellen, Gary, Ray & Kristen with the stupid finale with Oscar winner Joel Grey.Bringing in Barbara Eden for a reunion with Larry for several episodes. Susan Lucci for several episodes with that horrible, made no sense storyline that killed the April character.Bobby moping for another wife lost, yet another woman to pick up the pieces.The James character, terrible. None of these storyline made SENSE. How many more shootings did we need, how many more murders.They did their style of the famous Dynasty shoot out.I had loved the show, but these last seasons were just bad.And, for the end of the show, why NO EXTRAS on here?"
5,FINALLY SEASON 14: NOW I CAN FINISH MY COLLECTION,"I AM GOING TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST HERE. ORIGINALLY I WASN'T GOING TO BUY ""DALLAS"" AT ALL. THEN I WAS IN A ""F.Y.E"" AND SAW A USED COPY OF ""SEASON 3"". OF COURSE ANYONE WHO IS OR WAS A FAN OF ""DALLAS"" KNOW THAT JR'S OVERBEARING, ARROGANT BEHIND GOT SHOT AT THE END OF THAT SEASON. I HAD BEGAN WATCHING ""DYNASTY"" AND KINDA PUSHED ""DALLAS"" INTO THE BACKGROUND. THEN ""DYNASTY"" WENT OFF THE AIR AND ""DALLAS"" WAS STILL ON. SO I CAME BACK TO ""DALLAS"". UNFORTUNATELY I WAS LOST ON THE CHARACTERS BUT JR WAS STILL ENTERTAINING. NOW WITH SEVERAL SEASONS TUCKED AWAY IN MY COLLECTION, I CAN FINALLY PURCHASE THE REST OF THEM. I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SEASON 14. I AM GOING TO BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE WITH A TON OF CHOCOLATE, GET COZY AND ENJOY."
3,Worst season,"They should have called it quits and not made such a terrible last season. It was so bad, I couldnt even sit through the terrible writing and the horrid acting. I mean, theres not much to do are talk about here in this season, its just bobby and j.r. going around in circles."
2,A sorry goodbye to a giant,"Dallas had already run out a steam by Season 13. Now in 14 with many of the original characters gone, it's a pale and pointless ghost of itself. But I bought it to complete the set, if only to get one more glimpse of the magnificent Linda Gray as a Sue Ellen who never met JR."
2,A disaster minus 2,"With the exception of the last 2 episodes with Joel Gray, this last year of Dallas was a boring disaster."
3,Unusual Season,"The fourteenth season was unusual at best. Many of the regulars were gone from the entire season. The end with JR's fantasy was outrageous. I have purchased and watched all 14 seasons, the show is definately entertaining. I enjoyed watching the development of characters especially Sue Ellen, sorry she was not there at the end."
5,The Best Dallas Episode Ever Show.,"My Favorite Scenes Was How without J.R. Ewing Then There would have Been another Brother in his Place Which would have Been Jason as The Youngest.Also I Like the scene where Life would Have Been Liked if Cally ( J.R,s Third or Forth Wife.) Had Never Before Met Thanks To J.R. Never Being Before Born."
5,Great book to Realize the Small Things in Life Matter!,"There are 10 do-nothing exercises to calm you down quickly plus darling comments and quotes.Actually they're not exactly do-nothing they're more rethink yourself to calm down, be happier and enjoy whatever you're doing or do the best at looking foward to what you want to do next.Do nothing - zip - nothing - nada. Yes, often the key to changing your life isn't in doing more, more, more...but doing absolutely nothing but appreciating life. So don't just stand there and do nothing. Read this book...and start really doing nothing! (from the back of the book).Remember I have just found out I have cancer on my lip and it has to be removed and find out if it's spread - there is NOTHING that is more important than enjoying your life while you can!"
3,Nothing,"This book is the antithesis of everything I learned in school. You can't, I was told, change your life unless you do things.This book dares to say no. Relax. Chill. Just when you are ready to snap, stop and drop everything. Do nothing.Daring. Brave. I am trying this."
3,DICTIONARY BRITISH - AMERICAN & A-B,it's worth to improve my English and so i can distinguish some different words between B/A & A/B.
5,Bose 251,I replaced my JBL Studio speakers with the Bose 251 and heard such a big difference in sound and clarity.You can't go wrong buying these speakers.
4,great speakers,"got these a couple of weeks ago from the bose store. they installed super easily, brackets sturdy and easy to place. the sound is phenomenal. very crisp with adequate bass, best appreciated at higher volumes than you may want inside but very good @ any volume. didn't feel like the cost was too prohibitive in comparison to other outdoor speakers, the sound is just that good. also looked @ bose 151's and although they sounded pretty good, there was no comparison to the 251's. highly recommend these if you barbecue a bunch, are in the yard a lot, or entertain outdoors often. we no longer have to blast our indoor klipsch speakers while gardening outdoors."
3,Weight problem with head,I agree with other reviewer that this head is not satisfactory when using a long lens or flash on a large camera. I wonder if this is a function of age as I did not notice this problem when I first purchased the head. I also wonder if there is a way to refurbish it so that it holds better when trying to shoot at an angle.
3,"Nice, if you only need to keep the camera upright.","I have this for about 10 years now. It has been great for group shots. Only recently that I use it for macrophotography with D80 and 105mm VR Nikon macro lens. Unfortunately, the weight is too much for the ball head to hold the camera when it is pointed at an angle, no matter how tightly it is set."
5,Great Head - Been Using it for over 13 Years,Wow. I bought this head back in January 1996. It has been a great head that has lasted through at least 5 camera and plenty of abuse. I would highly recommend it.
3,Good product - Too Heavy,I like the product. It's been very useful to me. It's just too big and heavy..... I don't have an alternative.
4,Nice tripod head but doesn't support wt,I have had the tripod head over a year and really liked it.I used it with my digital camera.Now that I have started using longer lenses with it have noticed that it is no longer rock steady when I release the grip. Especially a problem when I have it tilted when taking vertical shots with long lenses. I have tried tightening everything I could tighten with no apparent effect.If you want a great tripod head for use with a light camera this is the one to get. For people taking verticals or using longer lenses it just will not support the weight.
2,"Good, for a while...","I have had this head for several years and recently only used it rarely. The concept behind this is sound, though the execution is lacking. If you want to support even a moderate weight camera and lens the tension has to be set nearly to the maximum. When it's set this way repositioning the head is very difficult. Even when tightened down all the way, if the head is set at an angle it tends to fall forward. It worked pretty well for the first year or so but is essentially useless now."
2,Not Really Heavy Duty Head.....,I hold my Nikon N90 with 28mm-70mm zoom but can't hold the Canon 5D Mark II with Power Grip and 24-105mm F/4.0 L lens. And I have not add the Canon flash yet.It can't deal with heat. I left it in my car for one summer season without using it. After the 4 month of summer heat in Texas. Now it cannot hold my Nikon N90 anymore. So you know don't let it cook inside your car. now I've to paid for the repair.
2,I can't recommend this CD.,"I can't recommend this CD. It contains twelve songs. Six songs are performed by the Guaracheros and six by Albita. The Guaracheros are good, but I think you would prefer the ""Buena Vista Social Club. Albita is excellent. All her songs were recorded before she came to the U.S. in 1993. In my opinion, they are better than the songs she has recorded since coming here. There is no blaring horn section, so her voice and the drums come across better. But only six songs! I recommend that you buy ""Albita Rodriguez y Su Grupo"" (Albita Rodriguez and Her Group). It contains sixteen of her best songs, including all six of the songs on this CD."
2,Review of Brady Majora's Mask Strategy Guide,I disliked this strategy guide for the following reasons:1. It is full of misspelled words.2. It is not very helpful in the Walkthrough.3. It is as if the writers of the guide have never played the game.4. Much of the information in the guide is false and doesn't coincide with the facts in the game.I recommend that one does not buy this strategy guide. I found it extremely frustrating.
3,Excellent academic book; but too academic,"Loch Johnson has done an excellent job detailing the interplay between the CIA and the Congress in the post/last days of the Cold War era. He is able to draw on firsthand data and tackles some interesting topics, such as the ethics of what various ""Secret Agencies"" do. If you are well versed in the Intelligence Community arena you will find this a valuable reference. If you are new to the subject; this is not the book to start with. This is a book of facts and figures; none of life and vigor of the people, agencies or even the author is present. If Mr. Johnson added a bit more life to his facts and figures this would have been an excellent book. I took a class from Loch Johnson at the University of Georgia - his presentation and arguements are much more interesting in person."
3,Useful for Adults,The book is nicely illustrated with photos of Pazyryk grave goods and mummies. It had a few major omissions. It starts talking about the Scythians but doesn't show a map of where the Scythians lived.It also doesn't explain whether the Scythians were Asiatic like the Pazyryk probably were. An ancient felt painting of a Scythian that the book shows suggests that the Scythians were not Asiatic. So what is the connection between the Scythians and the Pazyryk? Why is the Scythian material included?The photo of the tattoos on the 2500-year-old mummy was stunning. It was a glimpse into an alien world.
4,Well organized. Very good job of covering the basics.,Jan did a good job of organizing the video into sections and included video 'bookmarks' that allow you to fast forward to the sections you want to review. She had several students demonstrate common errors people make.
5,wonderful cups,"the coffee cups are wonderful, I will recommend them to our friends. As always I am very satisfied with my purchase.Thank you"
2,poorly made,"Cute, but crappy. My 5 year old bought this with his birthday money. They used it twice - and now it doesn't work. It didn't really work that well to begin with. don't buy."
3,TOO MUCH OF THE SAME THING,"Two Christmases ago, I was very much taken with Ottmar Liebert's wonderful holiday album CHRISTMAS AND SANTA FE, reviewed it quite positively for Amazon.com and gave it four stars. I wish I felt the same way about RUMBA COLLECTION which, to me, is, after two listenings, not even a CD which I wish to add to my permanent collection. The music simply does not ""grow"" and give renewed pleasure. It does, however, begin to sound strangely familiar and repetitive. Every number on the CD sounds more like the one before it and the one after it.The saddest aspect of this is that an original and exciting musician like Liebert sounds as if he wrote elevator music. I know I'm being harsh. This is not a lousy album; it is simply a big disappointment."
1,Avoid this bundle like the plague,"I'm a big fan of the guitar hero and derivative games. I have GH2, GH3, Aerosmith, world tour, rockband 1 and 2. This is the fourth toy guitar I have ever bought. I play at an expert level.With that introduction, this is by far the worst controller I have ever used. It drops notes regularly. The lag varies day to day by as much as 20-30 or more milliseconds. The strum bar lag and the fret lags don't match, so a lag setting which makes hammer on sequences work will make strummed sequences fail notes on an extremely regular basis, and vice versa.GH3 is awesome (definitely 5 stars for me). This controller is horrible. Buy the game. Buy any other controller. I know I regret having bought this bundle. Don't make the same mistake I did. Seriously."
1,Worst Purchase,"Let me just say that I am very disappointed with Red Octane. First the game was providing absolutely zero sound, which made no sense since other games on my ps3 worked perfectly. Secondly, once we got the sound to magically work (and this was the deal breaker), the wireless connector for some reason stopped turning on, so I can't even connect the wireless guitar to the PS3 anymore. I've only had the game for a day! Long story short, don't buy this game for PS3. Way too many problems considering it comes from a supposedly big company...I'm looking at you Red Octane. Terrible quality product."
5,Best gift this Christmas!,"This is an great product. I bought for my husband, but ended up playing for hours myself. Amazon promised shipping on Christmas Eve, but product arrived 4 days early-what a great company! The only bad thing about this game is that they don't sell the wirelss guitar controller,(or any guitar controller) seperately for the PS3, so head-to-head play is impossible at this time, unless you play over the internet. Just a quick tip-guitar hero 1 and 2 are NOT compatible with PS3, so don't buy them. It's a real bummer too, b/c once you beat guitar hero 3, you'll be itching for new songs to shred on!"
5,ROCK ON!,"I bought this game a couple of months ago and im completely addicted to it. The music selection is great and the online play is user-friendly and not to mention FREE (unlike the XBOX 360 version). The guitar controller is wireless which is practical, it is also very solid and can definitely take a beating. Overall this is one of the best games around and i highly recommend it for guitar novices and experts alike. The easy levels are a good start even for people who have never touched a guitar and the expert levels are extremely challenging not to mention this game makes anybody look cool strumming away to rock legends' music. so go ahead ROCK ON EVERYONE!"
2,GH3: how to ruin an indestructible franchise,"First, the guitar is NOT compatible with any prior GH game. Indefensible problem #1. Second, like others I find it unresponsive compared to the original guitar. Third, in all prior GH games I could 5 star all but the top tier songs on expert. In GH3 hard mode is equal to expert in the previous games, and I won't even try expert, which I assume is unplayable. Instead of an immersive experience I'm furious while playing it over the blatant way the game is designed to be inaccessible even to experienced players. There's no feeling like you're playing the song when you can't hit any notes in succession. Hammer-ons and pull-offs are as hard now as the original, and since they make up massive sections of songs, those songs are worthless. Plus you can't play Sabotage w/out another player. Are they TRYING to turn us away? Avoid this and hope Rock Band gets it right."
1,A step down from PS2 in every way,I played GH2 with the wireless bundle for years with no problem. I buy this bundle and day 2 the strum gets stuck and notes are missed and the game is essentially useless and a waste of money. Awesome. Done with guitar hero.Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock Wireless Bundle
1,Do not buy!,"It's really hard to review an item when it doesnt work. When i tried to connect the guitar with my ps3 it just wouldn't sync. I tried everything but no dice. Some might say ""you weren't doing it right"" well trust me i was. I'm not new to video games or electronics for that matter. Sent it right back. Look it up on google. This product is known for having this issue. Wish i would've done more research before purchasing."
1,did not work,"the guitar controller or the dongle was defective. i had never purchased any of the rockband or guitar hero games before, so i was rather disappointed that it didn't work."
4,Game,The game i know is great but the connector pick went out on me like 2 days after i purchased it.
2,No hospitality,"whoever sold me this sold me a broken product. I recieved the bundle ahead of the earliest date. The guitar on the game, one of the buttons is finicky. Sometimes the button works and other times it doesn't. I got the game and thats good but they sold me something different then what I paid for. Even after not recieving contact from the seller when I requested some communication, they never came to my aid."
3,Some issues,"Be advised that there are still some bugs with the release on the PS3 format. Internet connectivity is an issue so don't expect a smooth experience there. It takes quite a few attempts of at least 2 dozen tries before you can connect to someone.There is only one guitar available and that is with the expensive game pack. Individual guitars will be released early next year. Don't expect Guitar Hero 2 wired guitars to play even with the adapter.Also, if you are interested in the new Rock Band, the Les Paul guitar (one included with GH3) will not work as of yet for Rock Band. Again, Rock Band has only one included guitar with expensive game pack and no individuals available until eary next year."
2,Dissappointing guitar,"For those of you still thinking of buying this for a cheap guitar to use with newer guitar hero games I urge you to think twice. The quality of this guitar is so frighteningly poor that I'm literally throwing it away today and ordering a GH5 guitar. It just does not work properly. It frequently misses notes and today just won't maintain a connection. Do a google search and you will find that this bundle is infamous for faulty guitars. Spend the extra money for a GH5 bundle, it is worth it."
3,Good!,"I would just say is good, because i bought the bundle and guess what, the guitar doesnt work at all, so i have to buy a new guitar. I guess theres not a lot of people out there with the same problem...maybe"
4,Guitar Hero III,Great Product and great Console!!!Really recommend this product to have many hours of fun.Enjoy it !
3,Very satisfied,"I was simply amazed at how fast i recieved this. I ordered it on a Thurs and it was here on Monday. Its a fun game to play and my son loves it, Amazon is the best"
3,the guitar is crap,"I won't waste my time re listing all the problems with the guitar controller, just read other's reviews.I love this game, but there is a definite lag and the controller took 20 minutes to hook up right."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this game reading all the positive reviews, but this is a waste of $100. Unless you get the notes perfect every time not a little early or late, you fail the song. This is not fun. Very frustrating to say the least. The guitar doesn't even have strings."
5,"Had me rollin, it's a must have!!!","I must have watched this dvd over ten times, and it's still fresh. We need more comedians like Earthquake, comedic genius.Hard to believe he wasnt on Original kings of comedy."
2,Same ole stuff,This is just the same stuff I have seen him do live and on television. I am not sure if it is worth the money spent.
2,"half good, then violence against women no wonder he aint blow up","I loooove comedy, collect it, watch a ton, can take a joke, live in the hood so I understand the material- matter of fact, 2 people just got shot outside my window today- so I do know- this dvd is inappropriate, unnecessary and contributes to ideologies that provoke awful living situations and violence that plague our neighborhoods. These stereotypes are being reproduced and ""justified"" in a grotesque manner. His comments about Reeree and child support and measuring up to other ""brothers"" is incredibly disturbing. I try to support artists, but DO NOT buy this. Awful ending, he is self-defeating, self destructive, nothing at all compared to kings of comedy. He got issues, needs therapy NOT a stage.Peace."
2,"Bad Software, Good Book","I already use both Pinnacle Studio 8 and Magix Deluxe Video 2.0 Plus, however, when I saw this title , I thought what the heck, let's give it a whirl. Installation was atrocious. Additional components had to be downloaded. The program is not intuitive or user friendly. In general I agree with previous reviews. The only reason I gave it an extra star was for the book that came with it, ""The Little Digital Video Book"" by Michael Rubin. It was an excellent intro for those with little to no video experience, and not once did it mention this software. Don't buy this package unless you can get it for the price of the book or less. It's not worth the time. Or better yet, just buy the book."
1,I want my money back,"I never post reviews, but I have to in this case. This software says it is version 6.0, but it is obviously an initial release (who's heard of it before 6.0?). The program gives errors on installation, it often locks up your entire computer (I'm using Win XP), and the capture from your camcorder feature is rudimentary (it doesn't detect frame changes and divide it up into individual clips). I thought I would buy it because Broderbund is a good name, but I want my money back!"
5,It's about Time!,"A top-notch sampling of mainly 20th-century music by women composers, including Lili Boulanger and Pulitzer Prize-winners Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and Shulamit Ran, this cd proves that the music has been excellent all along. What we have needed are good recordings of superior performances. The samples often are brief--e.g., a single movement from Clarke's cello sonata--yet do provide jumping off points for more concentrated pursuit of favorite composers. Those uninitiated in women's works will become familiar here with some of the best of the last 150 years: Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Thea Musgrave, and on and on. I hope every author of a text on music since 1840 will come to know and adore this cd, then include the music in their discussions of music history. It's about time!"
5,Aswsome Collection,I'm a huge 80's Hair Band Fan and this collection is great. A good sample from many of their CD's.
3,The Garage Still Sounds Good,"OK Look, Why did they not get Huge Like ""Dokken"" huge? I'll tell you why..If you have ever been to a really good rock club and listened to the -so-called- house band, sure they rocked, but they are just run of the mill. Plain and simple. This band is good but not great, the music is predictable without thought or imagination. The best place for them is exactly where they were. opening for other great bands, something to entertain while we waited for the real show. Sorry, I know they have lots of fans and a dedicated following, but, the fact remains that if you listen to their albums back to back, they all sound the same, a glamorous version of the Good Ol Garage Band.."
2,Low par,"I only listened to the samples and I summize not buying this album (unless your a girl that wants to stare at the album cover and go gaga over these pretty boys). Sub-par talent, mainly regurgitated guitars/leads and terrible vocals. They make bon jovi who I think are ok seem kickin ass; and I loved some big hair bands- believe me (Ratt, Dokken and White lion) anyways... They pretty much SUK!!!"
2,INCOMPLETE Compilation Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD does not include the song ""Action"" which, in my opinion, makes it an INCOMPLETE compilation album. If you can find their debut self-titled CD (the album from which this song originates), THEN BUY IT ON THE SPOT!!!!!!!! I can't believe they would leave it off of a ""best of"" CD! It boggles my mind to no end. One star for ""Autoblast"" and one for ""School of Hard Knocks"", but three stars are for ""Action"", and that's missing!!! So sad............."
1,This collection has me Jazzed!,"I am so jazzed about this collection that there just aren't the words to describe it! This was the band that took me through the 80's, and when they decided not to release any more recordings after ""In Heat"", I was crushed. Now all my tapes are in pretty bad shape, and my record player no longer works - so discovering that I can re-live my favorite tunes (I'm the King, Miss Mystery, Suspicious) on CD has made my day! If you haven't discovered Black 'n' Blue yet, here's your chance!!"
2,"Very bland, but one great song","""The Last Good Day of the Year"" must have been an epiphany of sorts for Cousteau. It's a near perfect song that evokes Bacharach at his best. The vocals, lyrics and music blend perfectly to create a lush sense of reflection and longing. As for the rest of the CD...fodder for the dollar, half-pound and euro bin. Not that any of it is particularly bad (although there are a few painful ones), just very ho-hum and what-the-f***-whatever. Excellent musicianship never has been and never will be a substitute for a good song."
1,repugnant,"want to waste your time and money on some third-rate burt bararach? then purchase this charmer (sic). the low-lights: horrific, over-wrought vocals, narcoleptic-inducing insturmentation, and pretensiousness unrivaled in today's music scene, excepting perhaps self-annointed god-boy Bono. this is vile yuppie swill at its worst, aimed at ""swingin"" bachelor types hoping to impress the ladies with their debonair smoothness. oh, and any comparisions to nick drake are deplorable and should be disregarded with extreme prejudice. nick was the the real deal, unlike these hacks, and this eponymous rubbish can't hold ""Five Leaves Left""'s jock."
1,Nice but no thanks,I can tell the musicians are very talented but this album sounds like glorified elevator music. I am embarrassed that I even bought it.
1,Disappointing,The 24k gold over stirling silver is very pale and looks nothing like 24k.The product was received 7 days after the maximum shipping date.Very disappointed.
3,"Mystery, Action, Gypsies, Gold, Theft and some Fun","Martin Cruz Smith creates at least one memorable character in this novel of mystery and theft. His descriptions and characters are very nice, though not to the same level of interest of his later work. His easy style of writing makes for a fun read. You get a taste of Gypsy life and history wrapped in an exciting story of hidden/found/lost/stolen/conterfeit crown jewels. If you like Martin Cruz Smith, you'll enjoy this book, as I did."
1,.....and worse again.,"I don't understand why this is called Punk-O-Rama. There are a couple of punk bands on there, and good ones, Bad Religion, Dropkick's, Bouncing Souls, Pennywise, Pulley, Randy etc. Then the rest of them are slow emo rubbish, and worst of all, there is about 3 rap songs. I would understand if it was just another compilation, but it is called PUNK-o-rama, and therefore, should be punk, and punk only. You buy the Punk-O-Rama series and expect to listen to old, new and upcoming punk bands, like the earlier Punk-O-Rama CD's. If I wanted to listen to rap I would start looking at Eminem or Snoop Dogg CD's. 1 star anyway for the 5 or 6 good songs on there, by the above bands I mentioned."
4,a great variety of music,"This is the first Punk-o-rama cd i purchased. i thought it was very good, but if you like only true punk rock this cd will dissapoint you. there are only a few punk songs and the rest are emo,punkpop and indy and even some rockability and hiphop. like most people here i didnt exactly understand why hiphop was on a punk complication. but anyway, i loved this cd and many of the songs on here are excellent. if you are like me and love alternative rock then punk o rama is for you. and for the low price it is well worth it. best song: ride the wings of pestilence by from first to last"
5,Epitaph does it again!,"This cd might not be the best out of the punk o rama series but for under $10, it is an awesome cd with some of the older bands from epitaph and some of the new and upcoming bands from epitaph. Awesome cd and for under $10 its worth it, plus it comes with a very cool bonus dvd!"
2,Getting progressively worse,"The first Punk-O-Rama was great. Great bands and great music. But, they have gotten progressively worse. Obviously Bad Religion, Pennywise, and The Dropkick Murphys are great. But, there are a lot of marginal bands on this disc. Why is Eyedea an Epitaph artist? I like his music and his battles, but not a PUNK compilation. I would listen to the entire album on the first 3 or 4 in this series. Now, I find myself skipping just about every other song. I have not checked out the dvd, but this is a great addition. And, for the price, the 12 or so songs I enjoyed was worth it. But, overall, it was a big disappointment."
1,WORST OF PUNK-O-RAMA,How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo bands
4,Mary Higgins Clark Collection,"I feel that 5 out of the 7 movies were outstanding. As frequently is seen, the endings of a few of these movies were somewhat 'weak'. Over-all, a very enjoyable collection."
1,Read like a thesis paper.,"Not a particularly entertaining read. It reads like a thesis paper, scholarly and ponderous. Felt like I was doing homework."
4,why we connect with our kitties,"This book is a valuable addition to any cat lover's shelf. Author Simon interviews women of all ages, backgrounds and professions to find out just what holds this bond with our cats in place. Much of the pleasure of reading it comes from comparing your own relationship with your cats, both past and present, with the women interviewed and the author herself.Among the topics explored are: why are women/cats stereotyped so harshly and often similarly; why cat hoarders are so often female and why they do what they do; the mythical and historical connections between women and cats; how cats treat our significant others and what that says about how we feel about them (and how we let them treat us); letting go of our cats when it's time for them to pass on; and how our cats choose to communicate with their owners."
5,Great book for those who know cats,"If you know your cat's looks, meows, and feelings, this book makes sure you know you aren't crazy! We can understand cats as well as they understand us. I really enjoyed The Feline Mystique. It has wonderful cat stories, as well as great information that all cat lovers need!"
5,Very Eye Opening!!!!!,"This show was eye opening to say the least. I wish everyone would watch this....children, teenagers, woman, and men as well. I really wish this had been around when I was a teenager to watch. Maybe it would have helped me to not develop an eating disorder. But I am grateful that it is around now!!! It really made me think about ways to help me raise children with a better appreciation and respect for their body. Thank you Mr. Roberts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Wonderful Documentary,"Hello FightEd, I'm also fighting for the liberation of women and young men and find this new DVD cover to be exploitive. The original Statue of Liberty artwork was much more effective in delivering the important message of the film. You can get the original DVD at the website [...]---This is a great film and I'm not sure why the DVD company changed the artwork to a bikini clad model. Keep fighting the good fight!""America the Beautiful"" is insightful, funny and a must see film for every young man and woman in America. The director Darryl Roberts, whose last film was okay, knocked this one out of the park in a major way!"
5,Still Hungry,"WOW! This alblum rocks! What a follow up to CRASH & BURN. They are peakin! Joie & Merv formerly of Ozric Tentacles Rule.I have been listening to Eat Static since I first heard them on FEED YOUR HEAD vol 1. They did some very psychedelic techno in their early days of the band. I always liked their music alot. When Crash & Burn came out it seemed so different from the rest. A new sound with new levels never losing their trademark sound.They added guitar on some songs which just completed it for me. Then ""In The Nude"" alblum came out and solidified The pure genius of Eat Static. TEMPONAUT alone is worth the price. OUR MAN IN NIRVANA starts off with just blistering guitar and then brings you back to a techno finish.Old and new EAT STATIC is truly a force in electronic music today!"
1,Not up to my standards,This Globetrotter map does not show the provinces of the Philippines. That's like not showing the states on a USA map. Periplus has the best map of the Philippines that I have seen so far.
4,A Real Closeup Look at The Chairman of the Board !,130 pages of superior photographs of this giant entertainer and personality. You'll marvel at the closeup pictures of his life and times that are provided. The volume begins at his childhood and takes you all the way to the end. Includes a personal farewell from Tony Bennett. Sinatra fans will enjoy adding this to their music or book library.
4,Excellent Cleaning,"My old one died, and after a month without it I just had to buy another. It leaves my teeth feeling so much cleaner then with any other brush and it isn't clunky like other electric brushes.It is Very powerful, which can be a bit difficult if you have a small mouth."
4,good insight from the point of view of Waffen-SS tank commanders,"I would agree generally with the other reviews, that this is a collection of battle reports, possibly oral histories. I would have liked to see reference and/or foot notes and a bibliography so that other sources could be researched. I doubt this would serve as a primary source for any historical thesis, but I did find it interesting."
3,Brief mix of experiences,"This book, reflects experiences of some of the battles where the Waffen SS were involved. Is not a detailed description of battles or unis involved, is more a collection of reports that provides colour to other books or other informations that reader may have, reflecting report writers involvement and anecdotes."
2,Tanks a lot!,"Kinda disappointed with the book. Disjointed presentation that did not really hold my interest that much. Of course, it was written by tankers of the Third Reich, so I should have expected the presentation as it was."
5,This book work on many levels like the Kabbalah!,"This book is an amazing journey into the world of modern day Kabbalah. It feels real. The Seventh Telling, like the ideas of the Kabbalah, work on many levels. This book will open your eyes and hearts to something new. It's just a story, read it, enjoy it, be engrossed by it, and somehow magically grow from it's telling. Maybe it is not just a simple story?"
5,Exquisite,This book is a masterpiece. It is suspenseful - the characters alive with intellect and humor. The Kabbalistic teachings are truely inpirational. The author's ability to develop such a unique format reflects his exceptional talent. I have been a student of Kabbalah for many years and have never read anything exciting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn the mystical secrets of Kabbalah.
1,Nice idea but fairly useless,"This is supposed to work in the washing machine or the dishwasher. It may or may not work well in the dishwasher but it fails horribly in the washer. The hat comes out and whatever else you wash with it gets tangled up in the Ball Cap Buddy. Finally, this may speak more to how dirty my hats are than to the use of the Buddy but none of my hats have been much better after cleaning."
1,Terrible Product,"Frankly, if I could rate this zero stars, I would. The product broke in SEVERAL places in the washing machine on its very first use. But beyond being poorly made, it's actually kind of unnecessary. Having tried washing sweaty caps a couple different ways -- with this product, in the washing machine, by hand and in the dishwasher -- the dishwasher works pretty well. And, in fact, using the racks to position the cap(s) pretty much gives the same result as this contraption. Just save up your hats, do four to six at at time with a small amount of laundry detergent -- and don't waste your money on this."
2,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYACO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_91,my husband doesnt like the flat front on his hats so we used it once but if he did then we would use this all the time..
3,"Works good but, breaks easily","I like this product but, it could be a little more durable. Be careful when you open and close this. Mine has broke in some places but, it still works."
2,Hurts like the dickens!,"My little league team needed new hats and they all wanted something ""that none of the other teams have"". So after some research, I found this one. I really liked the ""futuristic"" look of this hat so I bought fifteen of them. Now I can't tell if the boys are crying because they lost a big game or because their skulls are bleeding. They aren't much for blocking the sun either.My wife ended up using them as devices for punishment at her veterinary office. Those poor kittens never saw it coming.Two stars."
2,Too large. Don't fit,"Too large. Don't fit a hat normally without smashing it. Did more harm than good for me. I like the concept, just wish they fit better :("
2,Too much Money,"The unit did what it was supposed to do. However, it cost too much for what one gets. Hope in the future it comes down in price."
3,Ball Cap Buddy,"The product ad on Amazon indicated it could be used to wash hats in the washer. It can only be used in the dishwasher. Not a problem, but ad should have been clear. The ball cap buddy flatens the ball cap bill, and does not hold the cap firmly when being washed."
1,Broke on first use,"The first time I used it in the Washing Machine it broke. This is a piece of junk. The idea is great, but the product from this company was horrible. My father-in-law has some that work great, but he probably got them from a reputable company."
3,ball cap buddy,this product recieves a three star because four of the basket arms broke the minute I put a hat in it.
3,Cap buddy,I wasn't overly excited after it took me almost 2 minutes to unsnap the fasteners. It serves the purpose but the snaps to open it are too hard to unfasten. Otherwise it will do.
4,Pretty Good,Seems a little chintzy but it is working for my purposes which is to dry and shape ball caps I wash by hand. Took one star off since I dont know how it would hold up in the washer.
5,Excellent Work,"William Hay's work THE WHIG REVIVAL: 1808-1832 is a well-written political monograph. Hay chronicles the numerous setbacks faced by the Whig Party during the time period 1808-1832, including such things as public skepticism about the party's views on the war in France and uncertainty as to the stability of party leaders. He ably demonstrates how, despite the numerous setbacks faced by the party, and numerous defeats, the Whig Party eventually does come to power.Democrats and Republicans both would do well to pay attention to the tenacity shown by Brougham and the Whigs. Anyone looking for a strong political history; a history of England in the late Georgian period; or a terrific treatment of Henry Brougham's career should read this book. As an aside, I have to echo other reviewers in their wish for Hay to write a biography of Brougham. Hay's attention to detail and mastery of writing will serve well in bringing this interesting character to life once again."
2,Poor quality coating,I bought this towel bar about 2 years ago and the bar portion is becoming stained with gold overtones. It will do OK as long as you do not leave anything wet on it for too long. The quality of the coating is mediocre. I ordered a new bar to find out that the finish style has changed and does not match my other fixtures in the bathroom. The vibrant brushed nickel is duller and not as elegant as the previous one.
2,review,"Nice design and construction, but poor performance. Claims to be brightest LED on the market. I've purchased some that are bright using only two ""AA""."
4,Just as good as a Maglite!,"I bought this flashlight just to use as a spare. I was surprised to find that it worked so well. The LED is very bright and it feels very well built. Mind you that I do own a few Maglites and I happen to think that the Maglite sets the standard. Even so, the Gerber is a nice alternative."
5,Great Long Lasting Durable Flashlight,"I needed a flashlight, and I'm not sure how I ended up getting such a piece of hardware which cost a decent amount for what it is, but I am happy to say it was a great decision.It's incredibly bright, very durable and since LEDs use such little power the batteries keep on lasting. I'm pretty sure it's been 2.5 years and I've never changed the battery. It's blinding with light. I love the warning not to stare directly into it.Great flashlight. A real keeper."
4,Heavy duty LED flashlight,"This LED light is a heavy weight. Strong, built to take a beating. Has a sealed LED that is pre-focused and puts out a bright spot of light. I have purchased Gerber products before and have never been disappointed. It isn't the smallest of mini flashlights because of its length but I feel it is more comfortable in my hand. When you pick this light up you know immediately you have a quality piece of equipment. One minor item, not with the light itself as it is rock solid, but with the batteries that come with the light. They were depleted to the point it caused the light to put out much less light. New batteries and it puts out the 3 watt beam as advertised."
4,Better than I expected,"I own 2 large 3 D Cell Maglite flashlights along with 3 of the 2 AA Cell Maglites. I have to say that after using the Gerber, the maglites felt a little cheap. The weight of the Gerber gives it a nice solid, almost indestructible feel. The brightness of the LED lamp nearly matches that of the D cell Maglights. The LED also gives it a much longer battery life. I also like the swithcing mechanism on this light since it enables you to quickly turn the light on and off by applying pressure to the rear cap, or you can use the twist on to give a constant light. This flashlight is probably too heavy to take backpacking but it is powerful enough to replace the D Cell Maglights which I would not have used for backpacking anyway. The only downside to this unit is that you can't ""focus"" the beam like you can with the Maglites which was not a huge disappointment to me but prevented the 5 star rating."
4,Great!,"If you're into classical music and Fleetwood Mac then this album is for you! It's actually quite nice! I think this string quartet did a very nice job remaking Fleetwood Mac's masterpieces! It's quite interesting to listen to, especially if you're a big Fleetwood Mac fan! I would most definately recommend this album for big Fleetwood Mac and classical music fans!"
3,RJM Review,"Rescue Josh McGuire is about a boy named Josh and his exciting adventures in Montana. Josh goes on a hunting trip with his dad and his dad shoots a mother bear with a cub. Josh decides to take care of the cub by taking it home. Josh runs away because he is scared of his dad. There is a mid-July blizzard and Josh is forced to care for himself, the cub and his dog, Mudflap. I think this book is good because it shows Josh's bravery. It also talks about a boy's desire to try and change things in an adult world, like the Montana hunting laws. This book is worth reading because it talks about friendship, a son's relationship with his father and a love of the outdoors and animals. I recommend this book to people that like adventure and enjoy reading about family relationships."
4,Nicole's thoughts of Rescue Josh McGuire,"Rescue Josh McGuire is a great book. It is not my favorite book, but I really enjoyed it. It is full of adventure and excitement. The last two chapters were the best part of the book. I thought it was sad when Josh thought Pokey and Mudflap were dead. I recommend this book to anyone that likes outdoor adventure books."
4,I Really Liked This Book,The reason I really liked this book because the whole book made me reading ahead of my class by at least 1 chapter so I was a little disappointed when I found out that the book ended at chapter 35 and it didn't go any further.
4,Go Oregon Ducks,"Rescue Josh McGuire was a really good book! All through the book there was always something going on. We had to read this in our reading class, and i'm pretty sure everybody liked it. If you buy this item then i'm thinkin you might like it. Rescue Josh McGuire was a really good book!!!!!"
4,Rescue Josh Mcguire opinion,I really liked the book I like how it was inthird person omnishant because you know the thoughts and fellings of every character. I liked how Josh was able to survive so long.It was shocking to see all he went through. I also liked how everything came together at the end (Sam going to drinking classes and Otis going to animal school).
3,Not the best but not the worst,"I like this book, it's just not my type because it has a little too much animal rights. Don't get me wrong. I like animals. I'm just not an animal activist. I would strongly recommend this book for animal lovers because this book takes you into the wild and has bears,bear cubs ,and a dog. This book is about a 13 year old boy who saves a bear cub and runs away to save his live. I suggest this book for 4th-6th graders."
2,Good book for lower level sixth grade.,"This book is about a thirteen-year-old boy who runs away to save the life of a bear cub. I am not sure if it is just me but I think that this would be a good book for a lower level reader. To me I was never really on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened. There are a few sentences in the book that makes me think it is a book for fifth grade and up but I think it is slow going and in general just kind of boring. If you are going to buy this book, I think that there are a few better books choice out there right now. One thing that I liked about this book was that it was in third person omniscient and was able to skip around from character to character. Well, I think I gave this book what it deserves so there you have it."
5,connor brandons book review,"I think that this book is a very interesting book. I also think that it is a very exciting book because Josh Mcguire does everything he can to save Pokey. The book is full of suspense, especially at the end of every chapter. I like how the story is very realistic, because of that it is easier to imagine the story playing out in your mind. I recommend this book to people who love an exciting books."
4,Cadillac of Self-taught Latin Language Curriculums,"This curriculum is easy to use; cumbersome language curriculums can cause students to give up before mastering the basics. The Artes Latinae curriculum, including well recorded cassette tapes, makes Latin language study accessible to people who are not familiar with Latin pronunciations. Its written materials follow the cassette tapes closely so that the student has an integrated approach to language study. Although the the ideal way to learn a language is to have a fluent speaker tutor the student, this program does an admirable job of conveying the spoken as well as written components of the Latin language. Artes Latinae is simple enough to use on an independent study basis at the junior high (with a committed, intelligent student) to adult student level."
5,Professionals only,"This is a somewhat technical book for construction professionals. Not for idly paging through, despite its attractive, even stylish, execution (although my copy's hard cover was printed upside down). Only commercial architecture, only buildings in Germany."
5,Awesome,That's all I can say bout this CD!! The CD is awesome and so is Mark's voice. Plus not to mention he has the SEX appeal to make my heart beat a bit faster.
3,Dated De-Mythologizing,"In 1949 when this work was being researched, it was a major focus for historians of the American West to correct the exaggerated romantic legends that had grown up around many memorable frontier figures. In our skeptical day and age that focus is far less helpful. Roberta Sollid did an excellent job of debunking the many unsubstantiated stories that surround ""Calamity Jane"". Unfortunately, this work totally fails to help us understand the real person and how she came to survive as a frontier woman who frequently fulfilled roles usually reserved for men."
2,Judgmentalism overshadows the content,"If you are looking for historical scholarship on Calamity Jane, look elsewhere in more recent publications. I was surprised that an academic work, even in the 1950s, would so blatantly depend on judgements about Calamity's lifestyle and habits. Beed Sollid is downright hostile to her subject. Perhaps even more surprising is that the newer introductions and conclusions of the 1995 edition do not call the author out. I simply could not take the the work seriously with this attitude interwoven throughout. Her judgmentalism overshadows the content."
5,Nothing short of wonderful,"I first met Allison nearly twenty years ago; we were both members of the same vocal ensemble. Little did I know that she packed the powerhouse potential evident on this album. Her appreciation for the song stylings showcased in this album, demonstrate the depth of her talent. It is clear from these songs that she has successfully fused her surburban upbringing and Mississippi roots with her own unique bend on life. A must listen for anyone who grew up happy, sad, disillusioned and hopeful."
2,there will be boredom..........,"Oscar winning performance??? great movie??? Where's the beef?- lots of bread, and plenty of condiments, but nothing to sink your teeth into...What happened to entertainment? Dialog? Plot? This is atmospheric pulp.... I'm turning off this piece of boredom to watch ""America's got Talent""....How pathetic is that!!!!"
5,I'm buying this movie.,"I love this movie. DDL is wonderful in every way and satisfyingly pissy and iconoclastic. He intentionally looks like a beautiful scarecrow in this movie. Without DDL, Paul Dano's excellent portrayal of stinker would have been unbearable to watch."
2,Movie Good. Packaging Bad.,"The movie itself is great, but provided you don't scratch it while removing it from the luxurious cardboard slip case, you'll just crush the flimsy outer cardboard case it comes in. Really just detracts so much from the movie. For the price you would think the packaging would be substantially better."
2,One Word Sums It All Up - Weird,"Once upon a time not too long ago, some movie people got together and decided to make a movie about an oil tycoon from the turn of the century. ""Let's make it really weird with some really weird string instrument music from a bad horror movie!"" one movie making guy suggested. ""Yeah! Great idea! Weird! I like that. The critics won't understand it, so they'll conclude it's bigger and deeper than it is and we'll get Oscar consideration. Dumb people will line up around the block to see it!""And there you have it.Here it is in a nutshell: Evil guy swindles innocent people out of their land. He drills oil. He gets rich. He goes crazy. The end.Call me simple, but I'm the type of guy who likes movies like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" and ""Back to the Future.""Why don't they make movies like that anymore?"
2,Tedious,"The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is indeed Oscar worthy, as was his performance as Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York."" I say this because the two seem to be one-and-the-same, down to the bushy mustache. At times, this movie was tedious, and I wanted it to ""get going."" Scenes seemed to be thrown in for no reason (witness Plainview and his son in the dining room/bar when the movers and shakers from Union Oil walk in--everything said here was said in a previous scene between Plainview and the Union Oil big-wigs.) And the ending made no sense--just because his son wanted to strike out on his own, he goes nuts and calls him every name in the book. What happened in the ""skipped"" 16 years to cause this estrangement? And no clear explanation was given why Eli Sunday deserved to be bludgeoned to death in the final scene. Infinitely better than ""No Country for Old Men"" but still a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I love Daniel Day Lewis in almost every movie that he has been in. He is my favorite living male actor. Nevertheless, this movie was a big disappointment. I had been looking forward to watching it for years but I found the movie tedious with me looking at my watch hoping that it was almost over for the last hour or so. Normally I would have stopped watching a movie at the point but since Daniel Day Lewis was in it, I kept hoping that the film would improve. It didn't. The cinematography was stunning and the initial part of the movie depicting the early oil industry was fascinating. However, as the movie continued into the eventual mental and moral decline of Plainview (Lewis), it lost me. The final hour of the movie seemed to be a series of vignettes with little rhyme or reason. Frankly, I did not get it and do not understand all of the praise that this movie has received."
2,Why does everyone love this movie???,I did not like this movie at all. It is slow and the musical score is so over-powering that it interferes with the movie. I cannot imagine why the Oscars cared for it so much. It was not a pleasant movie experience. I couldn't wait until it was finally over.
1,Great film... Horrible packaging!,This is a review of the packaging which all but makes this purchase a rip-off! A horrible treatment of a fantastic film. The two-disc edition comes in a folded and cheap cardboard package. The discs are tucked very tightly into a couple of cardboard flaps and are so difficult to get out that you WILL scratch your discs every time you remove and replace them in their flaps. Why this choice of packaging was made has me scratching my head. When I pay $22.00+ for a brand new double-disc set I at least expect packaging which protects and does not damage the DVDs. I can only think this is a cruel joke made by the studio to the consumer. But I suppose 6 months from now they will be laughing again when they release the super-deluxe 3 disc edition with improved packaging and force consumers to once again pony up for the product. Horrible... just horrible!
2,158 minutes I'll never get back,"I found this movie to be pretty boring overall. Unfortunately it is also a little long. I might have liked it better if my expectations hadn't been so high. Although Daniel Day-Lewis was very good as usual, it wasn't enough to make up for the slow tiring story. The characters for the most part were kind of bizarre. Two of the main parts: a young preacher who was very creepy and the main character's son that had no personality or lines. The ending was also strange but very abrupt thank goodness. Rent or buy used(like me). If you pay retail there will be blood from pounding your head on the floor."
3,Not the best DVD package...,"Hands-down, this movie gets five stars. Go out and see it now. Buy it. Maybe the 1-disc edition, though. As a special edition, this dvd is lacking compared to P.T. Anderson's other, more thorough dvds. The whole thing is housed in a cardboard slipcase and folder which leads me to believe they didn't want to use plastics in the manufacturing of it. That's fine with me; it's kind of nice to see a slim, simple dvd package these days. But the special features on disc two are just as slim. It takes about twenty minutes to sit through all of them. There's a slideshow of pictures that influenced the look of the movie-actually pretty interesting, though it lacks context. And some deleted scenes, which were probably deleted for a reason. Lastly, there's a black and white film on the history of oil. Nothing really special.I can't stress how awesome this movie is, but I'd recommend buying the 1-disc edition because of the price."
1,Pruduct review only the movie is 5 stars,Personlly I think this is the best movie I've seen in many years but this dvd release is one big joke...hahaha.The 2 disc and single disc are put in cardboard dvd holders which in turn totally scratches the dvds like nothing I've ever seen.I havn't wacthed this dvd yet but if I can get through it without a freeze or skip I will be shocked.Paramount/Miramax go sit on it you all really put it to us on this one I want a complete refund for one packaged properly.I've never been this dissapointed on a dvd release and I've been through alot of them.
2,Powerful clinker,"I wanted to like this movie. It was filmed in Texas. It was hyped in Texas. Alas they set in California. Why not Texas? Must have been the Sinclair book. This movie has some awesome things. Some of the exterior shots are great. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor. He has some good scenes in the movie. I liked the movie' score. Incredible music, but a little too huge at times. So why doesn't this movie work? Too long, story too slow, not sure, but it doesn't work. Maybe the plot is covered up in music, oil fires and some long boring scenes. It just did not get to three out of five. PS I got it on netfix, but saw the cardboard that some have been moaning about. Cardboard has been used for years on CDs and it works fine."
3,"Some Solid Performances, But Inconsistencies Abound!!","I went out and bought this film on 2-disc DVD over all thehoopla at the Oscars over it, and I must say that it justleft me feeling like it was ""Just, Okay""!!--That's all!Daniel Day-Lewis does get deep into his roles and is totally believablein his role as the ruthless, scheming, maniacal lead character!The boy who plays his adopted son is great too.But there is much inconsistency and uneveness in the story-telling.The so-called rivalry between Daniel Day-Lewis's character andthe bible-thumping young religious zealot boy who stands upto him is not illustrated well..(only a few uneven scenes hereand there, which makes me think that some of the betterscenes are on the cutting room floor!)Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments too!But in the big scheme...Ehhh, not so much!I agree with one of the reviewers who said that the second discsucks as far as special features go!"
2,DON'T BOTHER.....,"OK, OK, OK ....Best Actor of the Year....up for Best Picture of the Year...I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE THAN A WASTE OF TIME - IT WAS A REAL DOWNER! Glad I checked this out from the library. Only gave it two stars because of the photography. I recommend you use your time more productively; hopefully on a film that portrays our species in a better light."
2,"Rough, tumble and religious!","There Will Be Blood in a nutshell; he worked hard, he cheated people, he was as mean as a cobra and enjoyed killing people. Make no mistake, Daniel Day Lewis renders a tour-de-force performance; unfortunately, unless you're a Texas wildcatter, this movie will come across as a bit too slow and maybe a tad too long."
1,BORING,"First the only good thing about this film is Lewis acting. He's one hell of an actor. After that, the story is so boring that I had to fast forward many times just to move it along. It's a very dark account about a man who has no redeeming values and shouldn't be shown on film. What a waste to see a great actor get lost in this terrible story."
1,Alas Death to the Protagonist,"I have a theory----If you're miserable, hate rich oil people, hate religious people, and have numerous personal issues yourself (maybe bad marriage, bad parents, bad kids) or you just feel deprived of something even though you have the world on a silver platter. And especially if like Oscar buzz movies despite it being yet another a dark clicheThen this movie IS FOR YOU!"
2,Bummer story,This movie was well produced and well acted. But the story is a bummer. I felt neither pity nor sympathy for any of the protagonists. The movie held my interest but at the end I was sorry I had watched it.
1,Worst Movie I Ever Finished Watching,"I went to see this movie because it had such great reviews. It started off really slow and continued to move at that pace. You'd think it was about to get scary or exciting because the scratchy high pitched music would get louder and louder. But no, there was no actual build up to anything at all. The plot could only very loosely be called a ""plot"". There was no point. There was no moral. There was only a rambly story that meant nothing. When it was over, my friend and I couldn't move because we just couldn't believe that we watched the whole horrible thing. We actually started laughing because there was almost nothing at all to say. We were just in shock. I was then banned by my friend from picking out a movie ever again."
1,Long and boring,The photography was the only good thing in this movie. The dialog was very dry and tedious. I kept thinking it would pick up as it went along. It didn't. Very boring story and 158 minutes is too much for a boring movie. Might be good to fall asleep to if you have insomnia. Obviously some people found something interesting about this movie. Not me. I pass on this one.
1,Boooring!!!,"As I began watching this movie, I had such high expectations and kept waiting for something to happen. I'm still waiting. Not well made at all, too much guess work involved. I'm not an idiot, but things just jumped around and didn't seem to make much sense and it dragged. There was no plot to speak of. I can't believe Daniel Day Lewis got the Academy award for such a wooden performance. I felt so let down when the movie finally ended. I guess there goes 2 hours and 40 minutes of my life I'll never get back."
1,awful,"Hard to believe this film was celebrated as one of the best of the year.It is uninspired, with bad performances, a very superficial photography.It hurts what a Terrence Malick woud have done with this sujet! Danel Day Lewis is a great actor but how managed Anderson to turn him into the worst performance of his career."
3,Not one of my favorites,I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis's movies but this I found hard to stay focused on. I it was too long and drawn out.
4,Grandiose,First the bad:1) The packaging is horrible. I think they are trying to save some oil in shipping costs!2) The beginning of the soundtrack sounds like something stolen straight from the TV show Lost.3) Ending feels a bit rushed.4) Drags on in spots.Now the good:1) Daniel Day-Lewis deserved that Oscar! Best acting performance I have seen in a long time.2) Cinematography is outstanding.3) The script is almost perfect. There are no filler words.4) Lovely descent into madness.5) The more you think about the movie after you have watched it the better it gets.Conclusion:This is a movie for thinkers. You get out of this movie what you put into it. There is meaning in everything. Daniel Plainview was a bad dude. Watch this movie to see one of the best acting performances ever.
2,there will be blood is hum drum,"Hmmm There will be blood wasn't that taken from Saw 2? I personaly found this movie boring.I found myself reading Stephen King Duma Key hoping to be distracted but found myself reading more and more.Folks is this the best Hollywood has to offer.Ya know if its not a movie about Oil and Politics then they don't want to hear about it.Although Daniel Day Lewis was good maybe a little mummbly{you would think his speaking would improve over the years,Quick call his dialogue coach} but it hasn't.I wondered to myself if Brad Pit's character in Snatch and Daniels character here had a face off it would be garbled like they were ubder water.This thing STUNK!"
1,There Will Be Boredom...,"Like others, I was drawn into buying this because it won a lot of awards and was supposed to be a cinematic masterpiece and bit of Americana. There is some impressive cinematography to be sure, but this movie is a five star train wreck.It boggles the imagination that anyone wasted the time or money to make this movie, and it further boggles the imagination that anyone would've liked it, let alone given it any awards. It rambles aimlessly for an agonizingly long almost two-and-a-half hours, ends abruptly without going anywhere, and leaves you just feeling numb and confused about what you've just been through.The story line in extremely poor, the dialogue is tired (at best) and Daniel Day Lewis's character is just plain weird, as are most of the other characters in this flick. It's like Tarantino took a shot at trying to make a big screen epic.This thing's awful, all the way around, and my copy will end up in the next garage sale. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,There Will Be Blood,Nothing like what I expected. My husband has been in the oilfield for over 25 years. Just a BIG disappointment. Would not recommend to anyone
1,D.W. GRIFFITH IS A ROLLING IN HIS TOMB!,"OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED by Von Stoheim's GREED - this ""homage"" to the silent screen is dreadful.Daniel Day Lweis impersonates the Great Walter Huston - shame on you Boy!Dano is wonderful though as the religious fanatic .....it could have been worse ....but very overstated as ""art""."
1,Disappointed,"Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a spectacular performance yet again. However, this film started out at a snail's pace with no dialog for what seemed like forever. Plot development was poor, even non-existent. I waited at the edge of my seat for a deep story line to develop, but was sorely disappointed when NOTHING happened.This film didn't at all live up to the hype surrounding it. I wasted 158 minutes of my life watching it."
5,There` s a competition in me!,"""There will be blood"" is a penetrating analysis about two equally transcendental lines; it's about how an audacious and smart oilman, who explores and makes drillings in search of the devoted black gold, may become when the dreams of ambition and greed transform themselves in ethic values; and how these fatal consequences isolate him from his friends and family; on the other hand we have in contraposition, the religious fervor of a faker who pretends to be the embodiment of a spiritual call.It's not a mere coincidence the chosen historical period reminds us to the well reminded episode that inspired ""Inherit the wind"" in which the religious intolerance was represented in a vast portion of the nation.Daniel Day Lewis once more demonstrates us why he is one the ten best actors in this planet with his spellbinding performance.A crude and revealing testimonial of forceful transcendence"
2,Allegorical ho-hum,"Slow and not much blood, not that there's anything wrong with that. Only that if you're weighing whether to sit through 2 and a half hours of a movie, you'd prefer to go in with no illusions. This movie is an allegorical story that in both its substance and form deconstructs the illusions we live by. The plot is slow and misshapen, punctuated by sparse moments of triumph and terror and manipulations and murders, and fragile loves across the void. The cardboard, threadbare quality to the characters is undoubtedly part of the allegory. The driven, ruthless man without illusions would seem to have the advantage, but for what? A great question that humanity wrestles with. This film contributes no insight about that, however. It will be remembered only for the iconic line in the final scene, a line that itself is out of place.Daniel Day Lewis shines."
2,Very disappointing!,"This is not a movie, it is a compilation of scenes that in most cases, have nothing to do with each other. There is no story here. I kept waiting for some semblance of a plot but it never came. My 2-star rating is due to the beautiful cinematography, but that's it. Lousy soundtrack sounds like fingernails on the chalkboard. And the last scene? I give up. No clue!!"
2,A huge disappointment,"The storyline, especially regarding the preacher, was ridiculous. I am a huge fan of slow moving complicated films; but this one bombed. With all the hype and the star Daniel Day Lewis; we should have been assured an entertaining movie, but it was not. Some aspects were interesting, like the scenery and the look at how humans ""use"" each other, but other than that, I don't find any other redeeming factors. Maybe because it was advertised at the same time as ""No Country for Old Men"" and that was so spectacular - my expectations could have been too high."
4,"Incredible Acting, Not So Incredible Packaging","This movie is amazing. The special features are captivating - the overlap of historical oil and mineral discovery with the novel ""Oil!"" and the development of storyboards for the film is a gem. The score is unique, and another notable special feature is hearing it overlayed and uninterrupted in the special features.The packaging, though, is bizarre and unconventional. The material, I fear, will not stand the test of time, and the discs are hardly secure inside their sleeves. A tri-fold opening for a slim, cardboard-type package does not stack well in most libraries or DVD display cases, not does it provide a method for closing the case properly. Seems like a bad decision."
2,"OK, but didn't live up to its potential","It started out with a bang and I was so enthralled. But Day-Lewis' character really bored me in the end. And the story too. Lewis's character was so odd and one-dimensional. And frankly, I don't understand why he won Best Actor?! It was like he was re-playing the bloody, violent, wild-eyed part from GANGS OF NEW YORK and I was disappointed. Doesn't he play anything else? Is that all that interests him in a role? OK this one he has a kid, or an adopted kid, and that opens up possiblities. But honestly for such a reknowned actor I'd think he could find some more variety in his roles. C'est la vie, it's his choice of course."
1,Nothing Quite Like Damaging the Disc By Taking It Out Of Its Case,"I purchased the single-disc version of this film, so I cannot comment on the collector's edition.I have to say, I think this movie is spectacular, so I have nothing to add as far as that goes. However, this is the single worst packaging of a DVD I have ever seen. I don't object so much to the fact that it is in a cheap cardboard case, but more to the fact that, by simply taking the disc out of that case, the DVD was seriously scratched. A space as large as my thumb is now completely scratched, and I have not even watched the movie as of yet. Simply put, there is no way that I will be able to watch this movie more than once (which is the point of buying the movie, rather than renting it) without eventually damaging it too much to watch it.I did not pay $16 for a package that will eventually require that I purchase the movie a second time. It's going back to the store tomorrow."
3,Ok but,"My husband made me watch this, it was ok, long, but ok. The entire movie I kept thinking Daniel Day Lewis was channeling Sam Elliot (Mask with Cher) and Tom Selleck, and he sounded like Sean Connery..like he has rocks in his mouth..really took away from the movie, trying to understand what he was saying and what accent he was trying to imitate."
3,Exceptional movie but packaging is a disaster,"As many other reviewers have already stated this is an exceptional movie with a great story line that holds your attention from start to finish. The acting is also superb, lead by Daniel Day-Lewis. Unfortunately the single disc DVD comes in a cheap cardboard trifold monstrosity. When placed on a shelf with other DVD's it is next to impossible to find. Are the plastic protective cases, with their fine art work, on their way to becoming extinct or is this an abberation. I fear the worst."
2,Character turns into an as@&$le,"If you like DDL, this movie is ok. The story is intriguing except that the main character turns into a real jerk. That is not a good note to end on as far as I am concerned. A little too much violence for the ladies."
2,Ending issue,Very good filming and story for the most part. The ending was so difficult to watch that the whole movie was tainted for me. I will say my son really liked it all so perhaps this should be a 2.5 star? The main character just ended up being to bad for me to ever expose myself to him again.
5,Daniel Day-Lewis at this best!,This movie is another great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The man is a genious! The movie is visually stunning and the acting is amazing! One movie you need in your collection!
5,One of the greatest American FIlms,"There isn't much I could say that hasn't been said. If you like great film, you have probably already seen ""There Will Be Blood,"" and if not you need to. It is one of the greatest films ever made.As for the Blu-ray, it's definitely solid. It's a good crisp scan, much better than the hazy dvd I had of the film. This is a film full of textures and darks and the high definition is practically a necessity for viewing it properly.Special features are still a bit slim, which doesn't make sense because other PTA films have had decent selections of features or commentaries."
2,That's no way to bowl,Yes Daniel Day Lewis did a great portrayal of madness...I suppose this was to be relevant to today's audience's because of our dependence on oil and our involvement in Iraq.....but it really doesn't connect on that level.... The atmospheric twilight zone sound track intrudes rather than supports the drama...We do not get much to judge the motives or development the Lewis character. Nothing like a little sip of gin and a bowling ball to crush someone's skull early in the morning as a new oil well is coming in.......It's not some well trodden feel good Hollywood movie...but it over reaches in so many odd ways...
2,Weird,"This movie gets you sucked in, you cannot stop watching it. The ending is like a Coen Bros. movie. What just happened!"
2,Choppy Story. Story is a bitch to follow. Poor character development.,Lewis is one hell of an actor or after seeing lincoln maybe he isn't acting or it's easy. It's really hard to understand the conflict or maybe they are all just nuts. There are little lines that give you a hint but this is dark and boring. I kept waiting for the punch line. Anyway don't waste your time for this slow to neveer developing story......
2,Vicious and pointless,"Spoiler alert.There doesn't seem to be much point to this movie. It doesn't say that all businessmen are bad, it just depicts a misanthrope who becomes progressively more vicious."
3,There Will Be Blood.........Kinda.,"I thought this movie started slowly, paced itself, then ended amazingly. The whole movie is very long and drawn out and at times the story leaves it difficult to watch. It's not that I have ADD or that I have to watch an action movie with an explosion every two seconds to keep my attention but at times this movie just has a lack of content. I think that sometimes people think that just because a movie has some interesting camera angles, a dark overtone and very little dialogue that makes a movie, ""deep"". The one redeeming quality that I found in this movie was the ending which finally tied the whole thing together and made it worth watching. I wish I could explain it better but this might be the type of movie that gets a little better the second time you watch it that is if you can sit through it a second time."
2,Most overrated film of 2007,"With the possible exception of ""No country for Old Men"" this has got to be the most undeserving Oscar nominated film. Yes, Daniel Lewis was excellent as always but that was the only redeeming part of this. It was an hour longer than it should have been. The plot was shallow and the characters were thin- except for our main character and the preacher. It really dragged on- I heard people in the theater moving around in their seat and looking at their watches.so, who would love this movie? those who are interested in the origin of the oil business and their crooked ways might find this amusing."
2,There Will Be Bad Music,"This was a fantasy film, as with most Daniel Day-Lewis films. However, at times I nearly had to turn off the sound because I found the music score was the worst I had ever heard. That would include ALL Ed Wood films and the music of The New World. Not sure what the music director was trying to accomplish, it did NOT work."
3,"Great acting, disappointing movie.","Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and he turns in his usual powerful performance. Unfortunately, I wish he'd chosen a better vehicle for his talents. I very much enjoyed the detailed re-creation of a bygone era, but perhaps because it was based on a shallow novel of socialist agitprop, the story did nothing for me. There are no really major obstacles for the protagonist to overcome, just minor challenges. Why was Plainview such a heartless misanthrope? We have no idea. Why was the preacher boy such a raving lunatic? Beats me. Unfortunately, all this movie gives us are exaggerated stock characters from a socialist morality play."
2,Would have made a great sitcom,"If you can fully encapsule the plot and and outcome in five words, chances are it's a story not worth telling: ""Miserable greedfilled man stays miserable""."
1,There will be an ending,"When am I going to learn? I listened to the critics again. Maybe they could try to be sober the next time they write a review. Is it possible for the big studios to bribe these critics? Naahh. A typical Daniel Day Lewis psycho, vein popping, role. Not to mention the soundtrack from Hell. A lesson in futility. This mind numbing, advertisement for Prozac, is considered deserving awards? Around my house, when a turd appears, we flush it."
2,"So slow at first, I gave up","Movie begins too slowly...and I have a high tolerance for that. Love the acting, but I gave up after 20 minutes,"
1,just don't,"I love Daniel Day-Lewis, I think he walks on water when it comes to inhabiting a character (Hawkeye in Last of the Mohicans, Cyril in Room With a View), but I hated this film. Nihilistic, depressing, it reminded me of those awful films in the 60s and 70s like ""They Shoot Horses Don't They?"" where it's just everybody losing everywhere you look, no laughter, no love, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I see why Lewis got the Oscar for the role, but the man he portrayed is not anyone I wanted to spend five minutes with (or $10 on), let alone two hours."
2,"Good Acting, weird movie?","Daniel Day Lewis is one of the greatest actors of all time. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good. My problems with this movie were the script and story. Not only did it not make sense, the plot is best described as awkward and depressing. The guy who plays the young preacher shouldn't be in acting, I can't stand him. I am willing to watch this movie again because I feel there may be more to the story than I give it credit for. That is why I give it 2 stars. I would recommend renting over buying."
2,"Should have been titled ""There will be shouting""","Not much blood in this but a lot of yelling. DDL was amazing as always in his movies but without him, this show is a direct to DVD crapfeast. Two milkshakes on this one."
3,baloney,"Like was this a true story or what? Like life is hard and then you die. Yeah. We know that. The main character, daniel day-lewis, talks like a robot. Why does he always sleep on the hard wooden floor? We were shown him there twice. Is this a true story? Yeah he gets rich from oil and he hates religious people so he gets to kill one of them. The most interesting part of this story is the deaf child who learns to sign and moves out of the realm of the wack job who is the main character. The ""extra features"" on the second disk do nothing to clarify why these things happened. Neither does the dvd jacket. I dont even know who played what roles. The jacket has no information. Save your money. This film is just as inscrutable as the reason gas is now so expensive at the pump. Baloney. Good thing this never happened in real life because its idiotic."
3,"Rent first, purchase later ... maybe.","All this hype and for what? Well, I suspect that the majority of very high ratings are from people who felt compelled to be PC about the film mainly because it won awards and they allowed that to influence their sentiments. The only intriguing thing about the film was Daniel Day-Lewis' ""John Huston acting style."" (Perhaps this was the comic element of the film?) On the other hand Paul Dano should be given more credit for his performance than I believe he has been. Thank goodness for the fast forward button on my player."
1,There will be BAD Blood,"Visually stunning and morally bankrupt. While the movie provides an powerful sense of time and place it also makes you wonder, why bother? The characters seem to revel in the most negative aspects of human nature. The film seems intended to drain the viewer of hope and I found one viewing to be more than enough."
1,"The worst soundtrack, of any movie, ever","I had to stop watching after 1 hour because the soundtrack was driving me crazy.It is too loud, the music is totally inappropriate for the scenes being played and it is just plain awful. I have never , ever watched a movie where the score is so distracting and annoying.If you can turn the sound off and lip-read, then for all I know the movie might be OK."
1,Boring,"There might be blood, but you might sleep through it. While the acting is superb, the storyline in this film leaves much to be desired. When I finished watching this one, the first thought that came to me was ""that's it""?"
1,There will be blood - but slowly; oh so slowly,"This was a movie that never seemed to end and never really seemed to go anywhere. Daniel Day Lewis was, of course, fantastic in his role which I found similar to the one he played in Gangs of New York (basically, a truly and completely evil man). However, TWBB lacked the supporting cast and the constantly moving plot of GoNY. TWBB was a very slow movie that felt much longer that its 2 hr 40 min run time. Unless you want to be bored into a hypnotic trance, I suggest you avoid this film."
3,"Great Cinematography & Production Values, Bombastic Story","Daniel Day Lewis does the very best he can with the material he has, and certainly the look of the film is immense and impressive. However the characters seem almost taken from some forgotten melodrama, DD Lewis included at times. A little too much Bill The Butcher in the film for me.Not sure what to make of the ending. I'm finished here now."
4,BUYER BEWARE!,"I must warn all would-be single-disc purchasers that this version comes in one of those crappy cardboard ""jewel boxes"", rather than the standard plastic ""clamshell"" versions. I'm sure the disc is going to get scratched, even with handling it with care.Thus, the 4 out of 5 star review.Other than that, GREAT flick!"
1,"0 stars, if I could!","This is one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen. The story was poor, the telling of the story was poor, and the acting was horrid. I have always been a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis and was very dissappointed by this film. Some might say that due to the complex nature of the supposed story that I didn't understand what was happening but many of my favorite films, such as ""The English Patient"", are complex and require that you pay attention to the film. This film is just bad."
1,There will be BOREDOM,Terrible movie. What a waste of my time. Avoid at all costs. This movie could make an insomniac fall asleep in record time.
2,So near and yet so far away.,"This film had some excellent dramatic elements and thrilling cinematography. The actors did a professional job and the characters were interestingly and even compellingly drawn. The film promised a lot and that made it so disappointing when it did not deliver.The story begins well. I kept waiting for it to open into something magnificent, surprising and creative. Instead it lost energy and momentum and became sort of meaningless. I finally lost patience and was in the process of walking out of it when it ended."
5,No Country For Old Men,"This is a fantastic film, a sort of study on the character defects we all possess. The dark side of humanity exposed, flaws illuminated like skin under florescent lighting. Faith tested and put under scrutiny and later proven. Tough questions asked but never answered. Egos bashed and bruised. Boys turned into men, unwillingly. These are some of the topics covered in ""There Will Be Blood"", subtle and sometimes blatant, it sneaks into your brain like a slow poison. ""There Will be Blood"" is old school cinema. It's not brainless violence, super hero melodrama. It's storytelling and character driven. The score is fantastic as well, casting a sureal vibe to a story that is as old as time, ego and greed."
4,"Epic film, not so special edition.","As others have written, there cannot be enough said about the power and significance of this film. A truly artful masterpiece, more so that it entailed a collaboration of immense talents. This ""Special collector's edition"" however is a joke and a studio swindle. Do not buy it there is nothing on the 2nd DVD but some stills and odd tidbits of footage that are irrelevant. Buy the single disc edition."
5,excellent offer,"nice offer. excellent business, I'd buy again with confidence. The DVD was in excellent conditions, as they said it would."
4,Capitalism vs religion. . . and itself,"Wow. This is an impressive venture. For about the first 14 minutes, there is no talking whatsoever, just Daniel Day-Lewis mining alone for oil in the middle of nowhere, but that time is well spent and there's never a dull moment. In fact, what you see in that quiet beginning foreshadows what lengths Day-Lewis's character, Daniel, will ultimately go to in order to protect himself and his company. For the most part, I understood why Daniel behaved as he did throughout the movie, lying to, killing and rejecting those around him. Daniel is, generally speaking, a likeable character until he eventually goes off the rails toward the end, a selfish man alone with his money. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an outstanding performance here, totally Oscar-worthy. The guy really knows his art."
4,"Skewed exploration of the great American themes of religion, family, and capitalism","Fascinating film exploring the great American themes of religion, family, and capitalism. Director Poul Thomas Anderson creates a parallel universe all his own (ostensibly the early 20th century) through daring use of lighting, music, and silence. Daniel Day Lewis's performance as the uncomprising oilman is superb. A few lulls and an abrupt ending are the only thing that detract from this one. Admittedly not to all tastes."
5,"CONTACT VIACOM ABOUT THE PACKAGING, I HAVE ALREADY DONE SO","I will not get into detail about the film (rated FIVE STARS), as there are many great reviews here and they all hit it on the spot about how incredible it is. My concern is with the HORRIBLE packaging that Paramount decided to use with the release of this beautifully haunting film. How does this get by the marketing reps? How does a mistake like this get by ANYONE? This release seems rushed and poor and Paramount should invest more time and money in preparing an ultimate edition, an edition that will prove worthy of the money spent by DVD collectors. As mentioned with most other reviews of the packaging, the disc was easily scratched when I tried to take it out and I even bent the sleeve with how careful I was trying to be. I have already contacted Viacom (who owns Paramount) in hopes of having them release the film again with different packaging (and possibly get the film with the new packaging)."
2,Anemic,"Two hours of bleached-out austerity followed by twenty minutes of expressionist lunacy. A man driven to succeed by his hatred and contempt for humanity has occasionally figured in literature (e.g., Absalom, Absalom!), but not very often in film. Unfortunately, the director drains the juices from his story with his bone-white palette, his tamped-down emotions and his penchant for shooting dramatic scenes in long shot (Man as a tiny figure against a harsh and unyielding landscape, etc.). Daniel Day-Lewis has little more than a dry, rasping authority, while Paul Dano is simply bad as a revivalist preacher and his brother, a piece of dual casting that makes for enormous confusion. Near the end, the film veers to the other extreme, with Day-Lewis acting in a florid, hambone manner that makes one blush. It takes a long long time for this bloodless film to get some color, and when it finally does, you may wish it hadn't."
2,Nearly 3 Hrs of TERRIBLE!!!!,"What a let down this movie was. There is no dialogue for the first 20 mins or so. The music score is overdone in this movie. Often times its so loud it is distracting, other times it doesn't even match the scene that is taking place. The movie goes no where for nearly 3 hours. Yes the guy is obsessed with oil..so what? I kept waiting for something more to happen and for there to be a point to this movie. There wasn't. The ending is terrible as well. After 3 hrs of dragging a meaningless story along, there is an abrupt ending. Glad I didn't pay for this dud."
3,There will be blood by Brandon,"I thought Daniel Day Lewis was outstanding and evil in this movie, but I thought he was the only thing good in the movie. It has a good story about an oil man, but it is very long and it gets boring."
5,There Will Be Excellence,"Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant. With too many movies nowadays, you can't have a quiet moment without people calling your movie boring, but it's the contrast of the quiet moments that make the action that much more intense. This movie accomplishes that juxtaposition. You get comfortable in your seat, then something startling shakes you up. Plenty of other reviewers have discussed the plot and some have pointed out comparisons to ""Citizen Kane"" which I think is perfect. This movie will be studied by filmmakers for some time. I understand it might not be some people's cup-of-tea if they are squeamish when it comes to violence, but you'll miss out on some spectacular storytelling if you miss this film.I'm looking forward to the Blu-Ray version."
4,Another wonderul performance by Daniel Day-Lewis,"Another sterling performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. I also enjoyed the performance of Paul Dano who brought a very eerie character to Eli.Only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the ending. As is usually the case, for me, I will need to watch this film a few more times.It was certainly a very dark film that brought home the point concerning greed and the fact that extreme wealth and power (oil) 'dirties' everyone and everything it comes into contact with. Now, I will need to read the novel.Interesting packaging to the DVD by the way. Was that due to expediency or 'green' packaging?"
4,"Entertaining, thoughtful and poignant...","Whether you are a Lewis fan or not you can not help but enjoy this picture.The plot is simple enough, but the execution of it is a masterpiece of subtle insight and pristine truthfulness into the human condition.This is one of the all too infrequent breed of movies which is so multi-faceted in its human element, refined and yet with raw and unfiltered boldness as it lays out emotion and character motivations with unhurried bravery, that it sneaks up on you and surrounds you before you realize it.Whether to explore the historical perspective, to enjoy the lead actor or simply to revel in the well executed totality of a carefully crafted film--you owe it to yourself to see this movie."
4,Very dark.,"Very dark, but poignant story of a crazed oil man who has a passion for money and little use for people. I kept hoping for an enlightening moment in this dark character, but his humanity just continues to seep out of his soul like the oil than runs from the ground, and he continues to make deep wounds in the earth...and himself. There appears to be no cure for the main character (played by Daniel Day Lewis), his heart just grows harder and more destructive. Opportunities for redemption and love are right in front of him, but he turns a blind eye. The story is rich in emotion and the acting riveting, but there is no happy ending.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,More bad news for the petroleum industry,"An interesting account of the early days of the oil industry. However, the entire production drags on with unrelenting accounts of the main character's personality problems. I can't agree with the Oscar treatment."
2,There will be Blood,"Another boaring movie, which had a bad ending and typically poor plot.I expected much more and got much less"
3,Unfortunate,"Overrated...That's all I got.Love Paul Thomas Anderson...Sort of a modern Kubrick...But this was not his best film, yet it's treated like it was. From what I've seen, Best to Worst....1. Boogie Nights2. Punch Drunk Love3. Magnolia4. Sydney(Hard Eight)5. There Will Be Blood"
2,Please do not call it Oil!,"Supposedly loosely based on the first 150 pages of Upton Sinclair's excellent novel Oil!, the only reason any credit is given are the dialogue taken directly from the book. Beyond the aforementioned dialog, there is an overall similarity in setting and premise, but that nothing even come close to the book.The movie itself, though well acted, is long and tediously tied together in a series of drawn out scenes. The phrase that pops into my mind about the film is Peter Griffin's analysis of The Godfather on The Family Guy, this movie ""insists upon itself. It seems the writer and director eschewed the idea of making a good movie in order to make a masterpiece, but in the process failed at both."
2,Average,Was not a huge fan of this movie. Usually I love movies like this but I just felt this one was missing something. I know a lot of people who loved it though so to each his own.
2,There Will Be Yawns,"Daniel Day-Lewis is his usual outstanding self and the movie is beautifully filmed.But on the whole, the movie is way too long at over two and half hours and the plot drags, especially with the Paul Dano preacher character.Directed by the overrated Paul Thomas Anderson (anyone remember Magnolia?).Cinephiles can rejoice while the rest of us can wonder when something is going to happen."
1,Save your money,"This is a terrible movie. BORING! Don't say you werent warned. I cannot believe I stayed up to watch it - I guess I was hoping that the story would ""catch"" at some point but it just went on and on, and on, and on..............."
1,"Tedious, obscure - or both?","To answer the question posed in the title of my review - BOTH!Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a powerful performance, but his character is not a person the viewer can identify with - which is fine, or would be if there were a sympathetic character in the film to offset his greedy, steely-eyed oil man.The movie confused me initially by leading me to believe that it was set in Texas - the landscape certainly bears no resemblance to the Southern California oil country - and its opening quarter hour with little or no dialogue was off-putting.Bleak, depressing, tedious - and deliberately obscure: not characteristics I look for in a film."
1,A life which should have remained under a rock...........,".......or, at the very least, underground---which is where we first see the main character of this film.What a perfectly bad idea: to produce a motion picture about an absolutely miserable old fart of a man who makes every life with which he comes in contact even more scabrous than his own.One-Star to D. D. Lewis for stunningly bringing to life for us someone who better never to have existed. Yes, this is just the type person expensive movies should put out there for us.****"
1,Slow movie!,"This was terrible! It could have been great, but everything was to slow and the characters were not believable!"
2,not as good as I thought it would be,"After all the hype, I was really expecting a great character film but got a long movie with little insight into the main guy."
2,Attn Women: Bring a good book to this movie!,"Great acting!! But wasted on a sluggish, slow moving, poorly edited story line. I thought it was because I'm a women. But my very male other half was more disappointed than me. And he's the one who wanted to see it!"
2,A big bore,"Don't waste your time. This movie is about as awful as Gangs of New York. In fact, he didn't have to change character much for this movie."
3,"On the movie, not the Blu-ray","It's ok, if you don't have anything else to watch. I bought it thinking it would be a classic. Wrong! Very long, like a classic should be...but not a classic. Great acting, great everything really. However, just boring! I kept waiting for it to go somewhere. Like I said, if you don't have anything else to watch, then yes...it's a decent movie. I wouldn't buy it though. I would just watch it on HBO."
1,I would have rather watched elmo...... AND I HATE ELMO,"This is a movie that tries to be artistic but fails on all levels. Very little character development, and what characters you do get to know change personalities randomly just to fit the storyline. I have learned that the more hype a movie has, the worse it will be. COMPLETE LETDOWN!!!!!"
1,Hate the Movie!! It was very upsetting !,"I watched the movie with my husband. The beginning was fine. It slowly escalated from one sick feeling to another. I thought to myself, what was this writer thinking? Who wrote this? It is very disturbing. It was too long of a movie especially when there were no happy moments. It was nothing but Greed, Violence, Anger, Betrayal, Jealousy, Hate, you know the rest. I could not find the light in this movie, very dark spiritually. I do not recommend. I Hated the movie!!! :(:(:("
2,Was required to watch this.,"Do not like this type of old-ish movie, because i was required to watch it, i did not like it."
1,"Long, Boring, ultimately Pointless","This movie sucked, yeah I said it. For all those people out there who think I'm stupid, so what, doesn't change the fact that this movie was awful. Rent it or download it if you just have to see it but for god's sake don't buy it! You will be stuck with a movie that you spent all that money on and you may only watch once, twice if you wanna remind yourself how big a mistake it was buying. The only reason this movie should be considered epic is because it takes an eternity to watch. This is a propaganda movie showing you how evil the oil industry is, and thats it."
4,Funny high school flick,"Funny film. Nice feature debut by Emma Stone. She is both charming and funny, and captures that awkwardness of high school very well."
4,(:,"Typical high school story, I love Emma Stone. This was a fun movie, I'd recommend it to anyone out there."
5,Emma Stone is awesome!,Emma Stone shows how ballsy she is. I love how she handles herself in this movie. She is really going to be one of the best actresses out there very soon. Keep watching her films.
3,Amazon on-demand it convenient,"I thought the movie itself was pretty lousy, but Amazon On-Demand is pretty convenient to use. I've since found other places to stream movies to my TV that are just as good but a lot cheaper for new releases."
4,"Cute, Funny, Forgettable","Emma Stone has a lot of great lines in this film, where she starts off accidentally lying to her best friend about losing her virginity. Suddenly its all over the school and for some reason its big news and shes a big slut. When did one girl losing her virginity become such big news? Or make her such a massive slut? Well, apparantly it does in this movie. And it doesn't stop there. She continues to add onto the rumors and her infamousness grows. Its a hilarious movie and I don't want to give to much away, but it is one of those that you kind of forget after a few days, too. Though you remember upon reviewing or talking about. Definitly a teenage movie, but cute. Recommended."
2,Tries too hard...,"I love Emma Stone. Unfortunately, there is a lot to be desired in this effort. The acting is too forced, as if everybody is in on the joke and trying to be funny without really succeeding. The film is too stylish with a heightened melodramatic sense of reality. I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief and assume this was a typical slice of adolescent life in Ojai, CA. The costuming was too revealing and ""high school"" actors were far too adult to really convince me. It works as a companion to The Scarlet Letter, but I doubt it resounds with today's teens. Maybe if I were younger, I would get it, but it is far too tongue-in-cheek. Believe me, I wanted to laugh out loud and ADORE this movie, but I merely giggled and was distracted by its slick presentational style. It lacked heart--actually having to reference stronger teen films of the 80's to get its point across. It is a great commercial for Ojai. And Emma Stone delivers. But just not what I expected."
1,Offensive garbage,Easy A tries to be another Clueless but turns into a pile of garbage. The script is both bad and offensive. The acting is absolutely dreadful from top to bottom. I deeply regret renting this movie and more deeply regret letting two 14-year-old girls watch it unattended during a dinner party.
1,boring,One of the most boring movies. I guess most of the reviews are written by 19yrs old females lounging in their pajamas.
1,Significantly Over Rated !!,I wish I had seen a couple more 1 star reviews so I wouldn't have wasted my time. There is no real content or substance to this movie. I wanted to laugh but saw only stupidity. Don't watch.
1,horrible,"If they spent any more than 12 dollars making this movie, it would have better been spent flushing it down the toilet. The movie also gave my wife the runs. Stay away."
5,Really funny,"I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, its a light fun comedy...and thats all it is. I loved the main character, she can act!"
4,An entertaining film,"A girl going through high school not so much as a misfit, but as an anonymous face, gains notoriety by pretending to be promiscuous. She becomes the target of a group of students led by a Christian girl who does not like her allegedly immoral ways and resents her newfound popularity. Easy A combines offbeat humor and a realistic look at high school life to bring to the audience an entertaining romp that will amuse and involve."
4,AFTER A LONG TIME,Great movie. Worth a watch. Emma Stone was fantastic in this movie and pulled off her character fantastically! Great script writing as well.
5,hilarious,this movie always makes me laugh and smile. it's clever and witty and just what you need on any night of the week.
3,It's Funny.,"I expected a lot more from this film.It's really amazing. In my opinion, Stanley Tucci (the father) and his character's wife really bring the comedy into this film. I feel that it's appropriate for it's targeted age group- although I would've hired more experienced actors... I thought that the leading character, her parents and her best friend, Ali Michalka were the only great talent. The directing was okay. I was somewhat disappointed. Rating of the film: 5/10 stars.If you want a laugh, check it out!"
2,Disappointing!,"Emma Stone was absolutely hilarious in Super Bad and House Bunny. Not so much in this movie. Must be bad writing?? Lisa Kudrow isn't even remotely funny in this either! Was looking forward to this one, but it is terrible."
3,Absurd,This movie is so predictable I feel you MUST know the spoilers. A girl's overheard lie about being busy one weekend having sex with an imaginary college guy is gossiped all over school in one day...as if any kid would care. So she begins taking cash and gift cards to also pretend that she had sex with various misfit boys. Finally the boy she is really crazy about takes her on a tender romantic date then demands real sex for a gift card. She magically redeems her reputation with a sexy song and dance school assembly and webcam confession.
3,OK,We were not all that impressed with the story line here. Our daughter enjoyed it more than the adults did.
4,An Okay Pretty Good Movie,Yup another yougster movie. Sure Guy gets the Girl. Classic Movie script and if like this type Movie uncommingly well done.
4,"Not as good as some, but better than most","Lately I find myself on a quest to find things that don't suck. It would be nice if books, movies, etc could just be good, but so many are terrible that simply not sucking is an achievement in itself.In that context, I watched Easy A - not really expecting a good movie, but crossing my fingers and hoping that at the very least I'd have a couple of hours of entertainment that were tolerable. Thankfully, Easy A exceeded my expectations.Easy A gets 4 stars. Coming from me, that's pretty good. I reserve 5 star rankings for only the very best. For example, Animal House and Caddy Shack would get 5 stars. Easy A doesn't reach that level, but it was an entertaining movie and worth the time."
5,LOVE this movie,Love love love this movie. It arrived quickly and in great condition. We watch it all the time.Thanks.
5,great movie,While my husband was in the hospital I needed something to do and had no problem downloading this movie plus it is a funny movie and help with the blahhness of being in the hospital.
5,Really good,This movie was really good and after you bought it you can watch the movie right after you buy it.
5,"Great Writing, Great Acting, Great Movie","A+ to the writers for this movie. Very well written, with a great cast to deliver the lines. Emma Stone was wonderful in her role as Olive. I really enjoyed her interactions with her parents and her teacher. Ignore the negative reviews, they either did not understand the comedy or just went into the movie with the wrong mindset. I highly recommmend this to everyone."
1,A SILLY AND UNNECESSARY MOVIE! I CHUCKED IT OUT OF MY DVD PLAYER AFTER 35 MINUTES IN!,"Real short and real simple...This movie is aimed at middle school and high school girls, I guess..Which I'm neither.I loved Emma Stone's acting and her character, but, for me, the movie is so awful that even a cute and very talented Emma Stone couldn't save it!I'd rather take 2 weeks and read the SCARLET LETTER book that this movie is loosely based on than watch the almost two hours of this Easy A movie.Again, little kids and more serious fans of Emma Stone will have a great time and think that this movie is cool. More power to you all!..And enjoy!"
2,All of these positive reviews are misleading.,"I personally wouldn't recommend this film. Don't get me wrong, it started off alright, but halfway through it started getting bad, not better, and then ended up horribly. I don't understand these 5 star reviews, I honestly don't. The acting was good, but the script was terrible. And the ending just blew."
4,Pretty Good,"I have always enjoyed Emma Stone's other movies and this one was no exception. She is so much fun to watch! (If you're not convinced then check out her role in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past). The story line was pretty predictable, however, there were some pretty darned funny moments. The supporting cast of Thomas Haden Church, Stanley Tucci,Patricia Clarkson and Lisa Kudrow were just icing on the cake. This irreverently funny movie is A-OK in my book."
4,Romantic dramedy,"I ordered this after viewing a rental. In terms of content, this movie is something of a ""sheep in wolf's clothing"". It presents a story about sex, but thematically, it's really far more about the pressures and anxieties that build up around relationships about the opposite sex. In these terms, there are moments that are genuinely poignant. Also, it doesn't do much to editorialize about religion or morals (other than satirizing general double-standards and hypocrisy), which I think makes it easier to appreciate.David N. BrownMesa, Arizona"
4,Easy A,It was Surprisingly funny to me. I enjoyed it...it's definfately a good laugh and a lesson to not do things that make you feel uncomfortable because you feel bad for someone else....I'd give it an A :)
3,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this, as I like Emma Stone and I like good high-school comedies, usually. But it was not really what I expected, not as funny as I anticipated, and kinda just...cold. Not in the good 'dark comedy' way, either. Something was missing. But whatever, it was OK."
3,One of BB's weakest sets,"It's not BB;s fault, his singing and playing are faultless on the cd. It seems the jailbirds weren't too receptive to the blues legend and that the material(not all of it) and backup band sound dated. Afful songs like Into The Night, are terribly dated soundubng today. BB however sounds great on Sweet Little Angel, Sweet sixteen, and a few others. all bb performances have value, but try others before this, if this cd were a pizza it would be a regular pepperoni pizza from a chain pizza restaurant. ok"
3,PART OF IT IS GREAT,"I'm only 66 pages into it, but I love this book. I would never have known some of these writers. My favorites so far are the Navajo night chant ""House Made Of The Dawn"" and the writings of Linda Hogan, John Graves and Louise Erdrich. Thank you for editing this book. What a pleasure to read such high-quality writing. Such a sense of the American West. Such voices. I like the John Graves story about the old buffalo almost as much as I like the writings of Cormac McCarthy. If anyone ever doubted it, this book shows that there is great literature from the West. I will use this as a guide to further reading. I can't wait to read more.Well, I read more, and it gets slow and dull and disappointing. Sorry."
4,"Phat track, with attitude!","This song has some sweet vocals, and dope sounding bass beats...Brandy and Monica look fine in the video...best of all, it has real meaning and attitude! Keep on, keep keepin' on.."
4,Never Say Never,"I luv Brandy and Monica together. My friends and I go crazy when the boy is mine comes on. We dance back and forth. Have You Ever is a great song, too. It is one of my favorites. I like this CD because it has lots of topics that young people face daily."
4,Pretty Good But Not a Classic,"I like Brandy and all and she has a good career going on, but I don't think she should do duets with anyone whose voice is more powerful than hers. ""The Boy Is Mine"" is a good song that came out in 1998- the year that music began to really suck. The video was alright and Monica's hair looked great. But you know, if you're going to have a video that's about fighting over a guy, make sure that he's cute, okay? Mekhi Phifer is cool, but he's not all that. Anway, I enjoy the song and just recently I've found myself being able to relate to it, but that's another story for another time."
4,this song is great and hope the album is too!,I love the song. I bought it as soon as it came out. I lovr the video and the clothing that Monica and Brandy wear. Keep on doing a good job.
4,Just back from Russia and this is way hot there...,"I just got back from Saint Petersburg(Leningrad), Russia on 9/18/99 and even though I am usually more interested in hard rock, classical jazz(as opposed to free-form ""screeching"" stuff), I found little of either because my friends there like to go to disco places (which I agreed to cuz I was being a good guest). I was amazed at how nuts the Russians are for songs like this one. I'm glad, too, because I have little exposure to this kind of music (based on my normal tastes) and now I'm gonna get it on-line."
3,Gets Stale Because of Brandy,"A decent song for 98's bubble gum factory. The theme of two sistas fighting over one man was tired then as much as it is now, but the song had one good point: Monica was included. Monica wasn't done justice being paired with Brandy. Brandy's vocals were never strong and they get worse as time goes by. Monica has such a strong soulful voice that she needed a fellow diva who could do it justice. Aaliyah or Tamia would have been off the hook and a much better choice. I know it was supposed to be Brandy's song, but still her vocals were once again not up to par."
3,CAREFUL,"This may have Frigo on it, but not violin. Late 70's type Calif. Club music instrumental no singing.Listen first I didn't and,,,,,,AssU&MEd...that; it was violin music."
2,Trying to find a goal,"I would definitely recommend passing on this one. The book's 6 degrees are not well defined and leave you guessing what the point is. There is an over use of metaphors, that fail to make any impact, and are quirky at times. If you are looking for corporate secrets of success look somewhere else. It provides little more than a motivational pep talk."
3,No Good,"When I heard MTV was releasing a compilation called ""20 Years Of Pop Music,"" I thought it was gonna be terrible. I was pleasantly surprised to see only 2 songs from the current era of bubblegum pop music (Backstreet and Christina). The other things I saw were quite surprising to say the least. I may be the only one, but I think that artists such as Beastie Boys, Weezer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and even No Doubt are misplaced. I would place none of them in the Pop category (Beastie Boys - Hip-Hop, Weezer- Punk Rock, Red Hot Chili Peppers - Rock, No Doubt-Punk/Alt. Rock.) I like them, but they aren't pop. For them and them alone, this CD gets three stars. Other than them, don't wast your time and money. Listen to the underground music, it's better than anything else out there nowadays."
1,20 YEARS...the worst songs but only 15 of them!,"Congratulations MTV...way off the mark. A span of 20 years and you put songs like Watefalls on there? Man, want a trashy compilation. Once again, in the true spirit of MTV....I am ashamed of you."
2,This CD is messed up...,"This album isn't even pop, it has a few songs like ""Waterfalls"", ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"", ""That's The Way Love Goes"", ""Borderline"", ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"", ""I Want It That Way"", ""Genie In A Bottle"" but the rest is just a joke, they arn't even popular songs. Who ever picked this track listin need a bop in the head."
5,Amazing,"I thought that this cd was truly remarkable!The mix was very good and realy defined ""POP"".I recomend this cd to anyone who enjoys great music!"
2,I don't like it,"It's not a good fore starter, but once it lights, it works as described on the package, just getting it to light is a hassle"
1,Tiny fire bricks $7 shipping,"The picture is very deceptive. This is a very small box, not the normal size ones sold at Home Depot. Plus shipping is huge."
4,what an ending!,"why I'll never know, but I have several close friends who hail from Troy, NY. So this book is a godsend, a look at Troy from an insider, even if it is of a century or so ago. While it was a bit slow in the beginnning, Casey's tale picks up and holds your interest right up to the incredible ending (will not give it away, but am sure any reader will be as shocked at certain injustice as I was). If you like mystery, murder, and mayhem, this is a great read."
4,Spinning into Butter,"Plays, of course, are meant to be read aloud but this is pretty gripping reading just as a book. The main character, Sarah, is ambiguous enough to be real and to elicit in many of us some clear recognition. She grapples with her racism in terms of the crisis precipitated by a ""student of color."" It is interesting to follow the dilemma to its finale as all the characters represent an academic nightmare of political correctness and knee-jerk liberalism. I plan to use this in my book club by having each member take a part and read it through. I think this would be a different and highly provocative exercise for any reading group. Hearing some of Gilmas's language out loud is bound to set up some excellent discussions. I recommend this play either for silent or out-loud reading in a group. I look forward to seeing the play."
3,Heaven or Hell?,"If a game was judged by its presentation alone, then ""Guilty Gear: Dust Strikers"" would be one of the best titles for the DS. My first real GG experience being the Gameboy Advance port, ""Dust Strikers"" surpasses that by leaps and bounds. The 2D graphics go down smooth and the music alone makes the game worthy of the Guilty Gear name. Of course, the game's biggest drawback is that it takes GG from its traditional one-on-one fighting format and into four-way brawls that quickly degenerate into a button-mashing affair. To make use of the DS' touch screen, ""Dust Strikers"" throws in 7 mini-games where high scores unlock special moves for fighter Robo-Ky. But it gives the feeling of playing a whole other game. While the whole setup's not a total loss, one can't help but think if this title had stuck with the old formula or even ripped off the ""Bleach"" and ""Naruto"" games, it would've been much better.This game is rated T for Teen: Violence."
5,Great song,"Nivea is new of course at Jive Records. Jive is a very good record company that is behind lots of best selling music. Nivea just might be the next. ""Don't Mess With The Radio"" is a great song that is very catchy & by the chorus, you'll be bopping your head & singing along even if you don't know the words. A great track, definetly a great single. Plus, you get the instrumental & 6 snippets from her upcoming debut self-titles album. 9/10"
3,"Don't Mess With The Beat, But Please Mess With The Lyrics","Despite Nivea's obvious singing talent, her debut single is lacking something that every song must have. Meaningful and powerful lyrics. ""Don't Mess With The Radio"" has an incredible beat in the background, but at times its not strong enough to overshadow the poor lyrics. If ""Don't Mess With The Radio"" is any indication of the lyrics we are to expect on her debut album, don't expect to be able to listen to the meaningless squabble straight through."
5,Great pictures,"Ted Smart's series of photo journey's are the best I have seen. What set's it apart is the concentration on great, scenic pictures of the area. I have had the pleasure of viewing several of his series, and this one on Chicago is the best."
4,So glad to have this!,"There were some hard to see scratches that caused playability on three of the four shows, but they were EASY to miss and I know it was NOT misrepresentation, just a mistake. But I quickly got the DVD and the show that I wanted was in perfect condition. I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS!!! I thank the seller. They were even willing to refund my money (had I wanted to send the DVD back), but I have the show for which I bought the DVD and I am very happy!"
2,Just weird,"My son who is 4 years old, loves Garfield. So when I saw this dvd, I snatched it up. It really wasn't what I expected at all. It seems to start out slow and boring and then as it progresses, it just gets weird. I think the weirdest part is when Garfield is doing his many lives...seems dry. Some of the content is questionable, therefore the dvd has magically disappeared. If you are a hardcore collector, have at it. Otherwise, there are other funnier cartoons out there that hold a young ones attention."
5,Hoo-rah!,"Another great DVD for a divorced father like myself who has every-other-weekend custody. I just place the kids in front of the living room TV and press play. Then I go into the bedroom to watch a couple of ""fantasy"" DVDs of my own."
5,"Attention Garfield fans, miss this and you'll be sorry!","I am right. You'll agreee when you have read my review!Here is a summery of the episodesBabes and Bullets - Based on a real novel, Garfield imagines Himself as Sam Spayed, a detective who has be assigned by the mysteryous Tanya to find her husbends murder.His 9 Lives - Garfield plays a number of roles in this show that is based on Garfield's 9 lives.Feline Fantasies - We see many of Garfield's Fantasies.Now get it!!!!"
4,NEW ENGLAND REVIEW,"This was a fun book for me to read. It pulled me from a serious and busy lifestyle into a place I want to go - somewhere warm and easy spiced with humor, excitment and mystery. Reaching the end of the book was like waving goodbye to old friends after a long weekend together. Now, I look forward to seeing them again.OK, Mr. David Paule, please write something more for me to read!"
