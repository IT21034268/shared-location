1,A complete dog. Not even completists need this,"This album is many years removed from the string of great 45s (and, truth be told, spottier LPs) that Roy Orbison released in the '50s and '60s, not only chronologically, but also in content. Which, here, can only be described as wretched. There cannot be any question that this represents the nadir of Orbison's recorded career. Though his mid '70s efforts for Monument were nothing to write home about, at least they remained several steps above dismal. This does not. Roy was in the midst of recovery from a heart attack when this was recorded, and one has trouble imagining what might have ""inspired"" him to hop back on the recording track for this dreck. Bad songs, lousy performances, hideous cover photo. This album manages to do just about everything wrong. Why Elektra chose to put this one back into print when so many classic early Elektra titles remain unavailable on CD is anyone's guess.dap"
4,big face watch,"this was given as a gift to a person that requested a large faced brown leather watch, it was perfect!!!! Met all our expectations."
3,OK but nothing to write home about,"About half of the interviews are really interesting. Bravo for devoting such a long time to some of the subjects for their interviews. Don't expect witty reparte from Cavett but at lest he knows enough to shut up and let his subjects do the talking.I bought the series primarily to see the Robert Mitchum interview but alas,that disc was defective."
1,Running on Empty - Stay,"Well, this was a used CD, for 0.36, however I only ordered it for the song Stay, with the outstanding backup vocals. The CD lists 10 tracks, the last one being Stay. Guess what was not on the CD. It had 9 tracks. Not worth returning it, but what a con."
5,Review for As for Dream,"I highly recommend the new book of poems, As for Dream by Saskia Hamilton. Hamilton rethinks how we compensate for finality--in physical death, loss, and even in unrequited love. These poems show how we modify and dissolve absolutes. The last poem of As for Dream, ""The First Evening"" illustrates Ms. Hamilton's dexterity in wheedling the richness of meaning out of an economy of words. ""What was to come?/There was a plank between my shoulder blades/ leaning against the wall inside of me, waiting to be put to use by the workmen/ who come at six and work until three."" Once read, the line speaks of a rest before being put to bodily work, then, the potential exchange of pining for fulfillment, and finally, the easy defeat of hope by time."
3,rude awakening,"Partially its the oversized book, but there is a feeling of too much white space on nearly every page. I like what is here, but too many of her poems in this collection feel rushed and often incomplete or not taken as far as they could be taken. I want half my money back."
3,"PLEASE, PLEASE, GET YOUR HANDS ON THE ORIGINAL.","The original Clash album was released in April 1977. It had the louder and heavier version of 'White Riot', not the lamer single version included here. It also had the rough edged melody of 'Deny', the Mick Jones tale of sex on the London Underground 'Protex Blue', a great manifesto of punk attitude 'Cheat' and Joe Strummer's rant about a bored weekend '48 Hours'. This American version includes the single 'Complete Control' released months after the original album. 'Clash City Rockers', 'Jail Guitar Doors' and 'White Man In Hammersmith Palais' were all released as or on singles in 1978 and 'I Fought The Law' wasn't released until 1979, two years after the original album!! Don't get me wrong, all of these post April '77 songs are great in their rightful place, but this packaging makes this US version essentialey a compilation album. For the true Clash sound of 76-77 get the UK original."
4,Great Music; Punk Attitude,"One of the great myths of punk rock, dispelled on this CD, is that punk rockers were lousy musicians. The members of The Clash would have you believe that they just picked up their instruments on Monday and recorded this album on Tuesday. But listen here to the great guitar work on ""Clash City Rockers"" and ""I Fought the Law"" or any number of other cuts. The guitars still sound fresh and out-front more that two decades later. Beyond that, The Clash were not just a bunch of guys making noise. A song like ""I'm So Bored With the U.S.A."" is both rocking and melodic. Naturally there is plenty of punk attitude to go around; witness songs like ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,"" ""London's Burning,"" and ""Career Opportunities."" Epic records has re-mastered and re-released this CD with up-graded sound and packaging. There are also two versions of this CD-The U.S. version and the U.K. version. Check the song selections of each to see which one you prefer."
4,The Clash emerges...,"Buy this album to hear the raw power of one of the world's great bands. Although usually classified as a punk band, the music of The Clash is much more complex than its peers and crosses over multiple genres. In later albums (i.e., ""Combat Rock""), the band loses its way and gets caught up in lame power pop, but this debut album is strong. You can hear the early influence of ska and reggae on ""Police and Thieves"" and ""White Man in Hammersmith Palais"" and feel the energy that will inspire 20-years' worth of punk, grunge and heavy metal bands."
3,pretty good for PDA & pages,"I got this planner because I just got a PDA but wanted to keep using paper for other important stuff and taking notes. The planner works as it should, but it's not perfect for me. The PDA is held in by a clip that clutches the PDA on either side, but my PDA has an battery expansion pack on it that makes it difficult to fit into the clip. The planner is also very thin with very small rings on the binder, so you can't put in a lot of pages, and with my PDA's expansion pack, the planner almost doesn't close.This planner would work better for someone with a regular thin PDA and not much paper."
1,Save your money,"I bought this item because I liked the feature of being able to charge in the car or home. From the time that I charged them and put them in my Canon the battery indicator always blinked meaning that the batteries were low. I tried charging these many times. Don't know if the charger or the batteries are no good, I think it is the charger. I bought a Sony charger and batteries and have had good luck they are outstanding and last a long time! I charged the CTA batteries in the Sony charger and now I use the CTA batteries in my flashlight but won't put them back in my Canon."
2,totally not necessary,"There's just not much reason for this product to exist, or for you to buy it. I guess I bought it because it was inexpensive and there were around 12 songs on it that I did not have. There's absolutely no liner notes, and the sound quality is mediocre at best. It's all over the map, and there are also some odd choices for a collection called Blues & Soul Bible...""End of the World"" by Skeeter Davis??? A blues classic, that one!A truly forgetable collection."
4,Real Rebel Rockabilly,"Crazy Cavan & The Rhythm Rockers are often referred to as one of the founders of teddyboy rock & roll / rebel rockabilly, and this 'best of' compilation is proof. The band, which comes from the UK, enjoys a heavy following all over Europe, and has obviously influenced many of today's rock & roll and rockabilly bands, such as Big Bad Shakin', Johnnie Fox & The Hunters, The Dreadnoughts, Ellis & The Angry Teens, etc.The CD, issued by the reputable Raucous Records in a 'Digipak' format, contains a healthy sampling of the band's first 10 years with 28 tracks, including ""Rockabilly Rules OK"", ""Wildest Cat In Town"" and ""She's The One To Blame"". Stompin'!"
3,Quick reflection,"Estoy interesado en el vestido y la moda a través de la Historia porque mi hija de 12 años María Gabriela está en un curso de Modelaje y Danza muy completo y necesita buena información respecto al tema. El libro en particular me parece muy interesante pera antes de iniciar su adquisición deseo mayor información respecto a su contenido, gracias."
2,Bad recording of a fired-up performance,"This recording has numerous technical problems. The engineer should have controlled the peak level a little better!!, for ex. The booklet says that it was made without editing. Gekic's performance is full of emotion and vitality. However, we call for more clarity in many of the fast passages specially in the Chopin Sonata and the Polonaise. His Gallop Chromatique is indeed impressing - although the music itself is vulgar - specially the double octaves at the end, which shows Gekic as a Liszt kind of virtuoso."
5,Lost classics,"Before emi japan released this product part of their jazz re-release program, I had never heard about this album, as I had never heard about most albums on the Jazz West label as well, for it's mostly out of print since long ago.Anyway I was intrigued by a quartet album(as I particularly like small combo jazz) featuring James Clay on tenor sax that was released on a West Coast jazz label in the 50's so I bought it and I was blown away. This is ""classic"" modern jazz at it's best. An album as good as most classics of the era. It displays delicate romanticism as well as hard swinging improvisations. Any serious jazz collection needs it.The Sound of SonnyArt & PerceptionConte Candoli QuartetCharlie Parker: A Studio Chronicle 1940-1948The Complete Original Quartet Recordings"
1,Two of the same discs.,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, and couldn't wait for him to see it. We opened it up right away, only to find that there were two of the same discs inside. Both disc two. There appears to be no way to get a replacement for the set... the choice I would like to make.I certainly will not purchase another one seeing that there were two other customers with the same issue.Silly me for not reading the reviews before ordering."
1,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my dad. Only to find out that it was 2 of the same discs, TOTALLY BUMMED!!",I would not recommend this to anyone. It was a great idea for my dad as a Christmas present only to find that it was 2 discs of the same thing. So now I have to find a set with disc the correct discs in it!!
4,A Record which makes you happy,Tony Pastor is a wonderful Artist and it alwayd make me happy and in a bright mood to listen to his Records
2,All the same in the rain,"I thought this would have had more of a variety, but every song sounds the same. I finally turned it off after 20 minutes of the same thing."
5,"Has a lot of things that I, a Northwestern didn't even know.",This book was put together really well. Everything had an order and only once or twice did you feel like you were jumping back and forth between years(which is what I think is the problem with most books on history). I really enjoyed the time the author took to describe things like the sidesaddles themselves or all the stages of syphlis. The Whitmans were portrayed in a completely different light than what most children are taught in school. In a time when the women were all but ignored; I find it amazing that this author could find so much information about them so that we could finally read about who they were beyond the wives of missionaries. Thank you Laurie Carlson for all the hard work you put into this one. It was worth your time and dedication.
5,This is great,What a great blend of ambient and electronica. I love listenting to this cd while I am working or painting. It is definately worth buying!!!
2,Sooner or later you will regret this purchase,Buy the Clymer manual instead: it is far more comprehensive and much better illustrated. The modest extra cost is well worth paying!
4,well thought out manual,"Haynes manuals are generally well thought out and illustrated based on a complete tear-down and expert rebuild. Haynes has been doing this for many diverse vehicles from cars motos and tractors for many years and have developed an excellent formula for presenting this information so it is useful to all owners from never get your hands dirty to expert mechanics. For me it is presented in a more intelligible format than other manuals eg. Chilton and even factory shop manuals, for this amateur mechanic."
4,Very Good!,I purchased this book for my husband. He believes this is a great book for anyone that owns a BMW Twin Motorcycle to add to your collection for any work you might want to do on your own bike.
4,Good R-Bike Guide,Good basic guidance to repair and maintenance of a wide variety of R bikes. Even includes obscure R65-specific material.
5,Good BMW motorcyle repair book.,"The purpose of the purchase of the Haynes manual was to get maintenance information on a particular model, the R65, such as fluid capacities, the location of the oil filter, wiring chart, etc. It is quite informative on these matters, with useful photos. Rob Real"
3,Should specify style of Jeep,I liked the material of this product but it was attached to the Jeep by buttons. I wish this was specified in the description.
5,RAMPAGE SOFT TOP,"FIT WAS GREAT , ONLY HAS A FEW WRINKLES IN THE GLASS HOPING SOME HEAT WILL SMOOTH THOSE OUT. ALSO CAME WITH A COUPLE OF SNAPS THAT I NEEDED."
2,Outdated and Incomplete,"We know a lot more about the KAL 007 tragedy than we did when this book was written. Perhaps the most important thing we know is that, when the fighter pilot shot it down, KAL 007 was already outside Soviet airspace.The fact that all the other reviewers don't see fit to mention that is very interesting.If Hersh were to go back to this story, comparing what he thought then with what we know now, the result might be an interesting, important book. As it is, this book and the others like it aren't worth much of your time."
1,Reads more like Spin,"Book reads like another one of the thousands that try to convince the public that our Intel services and military are complete buffoons and are always dropping the ball. My thoughts on what happened : Congressman Larry McDonald slams Pat Buchanan and a CIA Shill on Buchanan's TV talk show about future Globalist intentions. Two months later, Congressman McDonald dies in 007. False intel leaked to the soviets about a SPY plane flying over their sub base during a secret exercise resulted in the soviets being on the prowl. Voila, problem gone and the Reds have mud on their face. If you think this is far fetched, read up on the flight 800 cover up."
3,Target Is Destroyed isn't the whole story!,"Seymour Hersh's Target Is Destroyed is: 1.) one-third usable early-1980s history, 2.) one-third irrelevent conjecture, 3.) one-third calculated falsehood. Worth reading only if accompanied by other, more recent, books on the same subject."
3,not authoritative,"What a disaster. The plane is shot down by the Soviets, and some write spectacular stories. This is an interesting story, but readers should review other sources."
4,"Great Book, but heavy history","Being interested in the legality of Lincoln calling on troops to supress a domestic and not a foreign threat is appealing to me, since it was, what I thought, a violation of the powers of the presidency. Grabbing this, I thought it might bring aboveboard his actions. The title is somewhat deceieving in that the first 4 1/2 chapters discuss the founding fathers and their ideaology on various presidential powers and states' rights: intriguing to read, but way too much history of the constitutional debates. Finishing the book, I came to realize this was the author's way of defending his conclusions: that Lincoln did not abuse his powers and acted within the bounderies of constitutional law (though the last chapter discussing Lincoln's enfringement on Free Speech is hard to swallow as legal.) Still a fascinating read on the topic of constitutional power,that is just as important today as it was then."
4,Great CD - Love Joe,"I think this is a great CD. I love Joe Walsh's guitar playing and I enjoy listening to the entire first 4 songs straight through uninterrupted. ""At the Station"" ""Indian Summer"" and ""Second Hand Store"" always make me think of summer time when I was a kid and we used to hang out at the fishing hole drinking beer. Of course, this contains the classic ""Life's Been Good"" and there's also a great catchy tune called ""Tomorrow"" and a couple of cool intrumental pieces.I am a huge Joe Walsh fan so I have to say I am probably playing some favoritism but why not - I think the man is underrated as both a guitar player and lyricist. He may not write mind bending philosophical lyrics 24/7 but he sure knows how to construct a good piece of humoring lyrical content and he has the ability to make you forget about your worries and draw you to another place and time. And isn't that what music is supposed to be about sometimes?"
5,"30 years later, still playing the original vinyl...","I was 14 that summer day when I made my weekly bicycle trip to our local record store (yes, imagine that: a locally owned record store) where ""But Seriously Folks"" was being piped through the shop. I immediately picked up a copy and am still enjoying this beautifully written and performed album by Joe Walsh almost 30 years later. It's unfortunate that the corporate-owned, big, conglomerate, commercial radio stations choose only to play ""Life's Been Good"". In this case, that's like having a prime rib dinner and choosing only to eat the baked potato. ""Indian Summer"" remains one of my favorites to this day as does this album among the hundreds of old 33's in my collection. Thanks so much for the music, Joe!"
4,A gem,"This album is a throwback to the days when listeners expected most of the songs on an album to work together, instead of simply being a couple of singles plus filler. Certainly music still is made that way by a few artists today (the last couple of efforts by the White Stripes certainly fit the bill), but it has been the exception rather than the rule since the mid '70s.Not every song on the album is ""great,"" but there are no weak links, including the radio hits ""Life's Been Good"" and ""At the Station."" Like some other reviewers, I wore out my LP version of this one within a couple of years and am glad there is a good quality CD available.It always seemed odd to me that Walsh's fame peaked during his time with the Eagles, but his contributions and influences there show through, even among that group of monsterous egos."
4,"Joe proves he could do it again...and again,and again. 4 1/2","Production on this CD is phenomenal,musicianship is unreal. Joe is a true rocker and is very humorous,too. While he didn't take himself too seriously,he DID take the music and his talent seriously. Guitar lovers will totally dig on this one. The mixing and layering of instruments on this release is a case study of how to make rock records sound great. This is a must have CD,Folks!"
2,One great song does not a CD make,"This CD is just one more example of Joe Walsh's ability to come up with one great song on an album of filler. ""Life's Been Good"" with its distinctive melody and tongue in cheek (?) portrayal of the rock and roll life is a true rock classic. It would be nice to find at least on more good song, but the rest of the CD is just a couple of weak instrumentals and some instantly forgettable So-Cal rock."

5,Dynamics galore.,"in my top 10 albums of all time for sure, only thing is this cd is a little quiet which is understandable during the ""steve hoffman mastering process"" but i feel like it couldve used a little bit of a volume boost to hear everything even more clearer then it already is. The drums on ""life's been good"" are crisp and you can hear reverb on them for the first time. The definitive collection version is way too bright and dont have the dynamics this cd shows of the song. If you are interested in checking out a audiophile cd this is one to pick up for sure! this is my first audiophile purchase and im digging it."
5,70's were good for JW,"Arguably his last good release before his recent effort. Excellent from beginning to end, which includes ""At the station"", which somehow was left off ""Look what I did?"" anthology. Purchased the JAPANESE IMPORT/via Taiwan, although pricey definitely sounds superior to domestic version. Price was 5 times more but in this case quality overrode quantity!"
3,Joe Walsh is a legend!,Joe knows how to use humor and wit in all of his songs. Great and classic album that could use a remastering
1,All the text is in Chinese,"This book may be interesting, but it will take me 20 years to learn enough Chinese to read it. Amazon need to put details of what language a book is in on their web pages."
5,Be mesmerized!,"Mike Mainieri is certainly up there with the greats like Milt Jackson, Lionel Hampton and Cal Tjader, to name a few. This album attests to that implicitly. The piano accented ""Sara's Touch"" moves your soul softly, the ethereal ""L'Image"" is reminiscent of the peacefulness of the early morning and ""Pep's"" is flat out sensuous. Bamboo is a bit brash with heavy overtones, but it's a killer piece. ""Flying Colours"" is heart a pumping tune and the sax adds, rather than detracts from this one. ""Bullet Train"" reminds me of Donald Fagen and Steely Dan's intricate music. As to ""Wanderlust"" and ""Crossed Wires"" there is no way I can pick a favorite, but these two are worth the price of the CD alone. The undefinable quality of these pieces (don't think for a second that the tiny sound clips you hear on this site give the the whole picture) cause me to stop, listen and be mesmerized."
5,WAITS' MOST UNDERAPPRECIATED ABLUM,"LIKE 'BONE MACHINE', WAITS NEVER MADE ANOTHER ALBUM QUITE LIKE THIS. WITH SONGS LIKE RED SHOES, CHRISTMAS CARD FROM A HOOKER, ROMEO IS BLEEDING, $29.00, WHISTLIN' PAST THE GRAVEYARD, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. ONE OF HIS TOP THREE BEST ALBUMS. ACCEPT NO IMITATIONS. THIS ONE IS A CLASSIC."
5,In awe,"Mr black magic's tongue hisses the devils blues again.Listen to ""Wrong side of the road"" and you can die knowing you have heard the best blues song possibly written"
3,"There Just Isn't a Way to Cover the pre-""Full House"" Fairport on One CD","As another reviewer has said, this CD's selection is less than comprehensive -- but that's because there are probably more ""essential"" tracks on the average Fairport album to select from than would be true of a number of other bands, especially given Fairport's mutability and changing sounds.Where are the instrumentals? ""Dirty Linen"" or ""Flatback Caper"" or ""Mason's Apron""?Where is ""Sir Partick Spens"" the song that started me with Fairport?On the other hand, there's not a really BAD track on this CD.(I remember the first i ever saw the cover art used on this disc -- i took one look at Sandy sitting there and Richard looming behind her and i though ""Hobbit and goblin!"")"
4,as good an introduction to fairport as is available domestically,"this is as good an intro to fairport as you are going to get without spending the extra money for imports. it's short but cheap, and has quite a few of fairport's best songs. the only caveat i have is the exclusion of ""tale in hard time"", which is to me, the quintessential fairport track and the best representation of the contribution of ian matthews' splendid voice to the band, as well as one of richard thompson's finest compositions."
2,The Cover is More Significant than the CD,"I agree with Wilson (""gosh ... you shouldn't have"") that it is a pretty feeble effort to put out such a sparse ""collection"" of Fairport's music plus have the nerve to call it ""the Millennium Collection,"" and the 2 stars rating is for the minimum content of the package, certainly not the music (which is 5 stars). But this release has one redeeming quality for those who are collectors and completists, and that is the cover art. Except for the header, it is the original 1969 Album cover from the 1st US release (on A&M Records) of what is now generally known as ""What We Did on Our Holidays"" (it was just titled: ""Fairport Convention"" here). Probably not worth the full price (especially to those of us who still have the original vinyl version), but might be worth it used. It's a pretty nice picture of then youngsters Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny, ""Ian"" M. Matthews (who many forget was there), Richard Thompson, Simon Nicol, Martin Lamble and Ashley S. Hutchings."
5,English Folk Rock - The Blueprint,"20th Century Masters Millennium Collection of songs by Fairport Convention is the album to own. In the late 60's the lovely haunting voice of Sandy Denny and the guitar playing of Richard Thomas cemented Fairport's place as ""The Sound"" of English Folk Rock. Far superior to Pentangle and other bands of this style (including other lineups of Fairport) the unmatched writing, vocals and music of this incarnation of the band left it's mark on the music world. Matty Grove was so in demand Sandy regretted having to perform it one more time. Fotheringay, a lament of the imprisoning of Mary Queen of Scotts and finally her beheading was a showcase of Sandy's writing savvy. Put on this CD close your eyes and it will take you back in time to the days of castles, feasts, peasants, pauper and kings."
2,Probably better if you or your partner is truly conflicted..,"I am contemplating having children but am not actually embarking yet, and I'd hoped for this book to be more along the lines of a ""here are some things about parenthood that you might not know"" type of book. I am not conflicted about having children at all, just a bit indecisive about the timing. I didn't find much in this book that I hadn't read elsewhere. If you or your partner is truly conflicted about whether or not you want children, this might be a great book to help you articulate what your concerns are, or help you realize that maybe you are prepared, and just understandably nervous. if you're looking for peeks into the lives of parents, I'd suggest ""Mothers Who Think"" by the Salon.com editors, or ""Breeder"" by the editors of hipmama.com."
3,"small size, short book","A collection of the author's thoughts on cruising in a sailboat, in a small package. Each of the 60 or so pages has a few lines written about skippers, or preparation, etc. Book size is 5"" tall by 7"" wide, quite small."
3,Some songs much better than others,"I purchased this CD after hearing the song ""So Good to Me"". This song was so powerful and describes how great God really is to us. It is one of the best Christian music songs I've ever heard--and in the last 9 years I've heard a lot! The rest of the CD is more mellow and a bit disappointing. True many of the songs are very spiritual and enjoyable, just not real special to me."
5,"Freedom's what you want, Freedom is what you get...","Darrell is a worshipper ever since I have known him. This recording is definately freeing and will help you go deeper with the Father. He has always inspired me and has been a mentor to me in leading worship. If you like acoustic sounds of worship then dig in if not then this will be an album that will make you like them. The lyrics, music and heart will deepen anyones walk with the lord as you sing praises and worship the Father."
5,"Intimate worship of God,",on this release you come into an understanding of what it is to know the Lord.To be in the presence of the most High with masks removed. There is an undeniable anointing on Darrell Evans leading one into inner courts with love and adoration. This is true worship.
5,THE album to lead you up to the throne of God!,"This is an album that will be a permanent member of you P&W rotation! With great lyrics and terrific musicianship, Darrell leads us into the glory of God! Tracks like ""Trading My Sorrows (Yes, Lord)"" and ""Freedom"" give you a sense of renewal and freedom. ""When I Pray"" is raw and honest, and lets you know how it is. Few songs have brought me into the Father's presence like ""Your Love Is Extravagant!"" Get this album! You'll be glad you did!"
2,Glad this wasn't my introduction to Zahn,"After having read and enjoyed several Zahn novels (The quadrail series and Manta's gift) I saw this one in a used bookstore and decided to give it a go.Very disappointing, plot drags about half way through, and the characterizations are simplistic in the extreme. The ending is also very unbelievable, aside from the ""can't we all just get along"" theme that is very facile, there is the fact there half of NYC's police are called out and then quietly disappear without a peep just on the say so of a police Lieutenant whom the police spend half of the book thinking was a victim of a kidnapping.This is what those Star Wars and Star Trek series potboilers must be like, (his among them) and the reason why I avoid them like the plague.Zahn may not be the greatest writer of Science Fiction, but he can do much better than this."
5,Yet Another Amazing Glassjaw CD,For all you true fans... u know i don't even have to explain why this cd is great. It has to non-album tracks on it and cosmo bloodlos... along with the vid for cosmo bloodloss... if ur a true fan... u'll buy this cd... NOW!!!
5,Best of the best,"For those interested in Railroads in general, and the New Haven Railroad in particular,you would be well advised to grab a copy of this book. As a 46 year veteran of the NH,PC,Conrail & Amtrak progression, I found it to be very accurate, concise & mostly very interesting reading, bringing the whole history of the New Haven in easily followed chapters (couldn't put it down once I started reading it). Also, there are many excellent photo's. I strongly recommend this book."
4,Need a funnel!,"The precision tips are wonderful and allow you to do fine lines and great detail, but...filling those bottles with the mixed henna was a huuuuuge pain in the rump. The neck of the bottle is narrow, so only a tiny bit of henna will go in at a time, so it took me forever to fill the bottle with mixed henna. Next time I will try mixing the henna in the bottle instead of mixing it first and then transferring it. Will let you know how that goes. Right now, though, I feel like this set could benefit greatly from a small funnel to help you fill these bottles!!"
5,Just as decribed,These bottles work great and do just what they are suppose to. Beachcombers is an awesome store and they have great items.
2,Are you a bodybuilder?,It's very hard to squeeze this product until you're done with a middle size tattoo. My right hand simply hurts.
5,The Dream held civilization together...,"It was a plane of existence that only the Silent could reach - a plane that allowed them to talk to, to reach other Silent Ones, no matter how far away, whether they were across the sea or across the galaxy. Aliens taught mankind about the Dream and soon they too are using it. It kept empires together. It allowed for interplanetary trade and helped corporations to function. Slipspace may allow ships to move about at faster-than-light travel, but the Dream allowed people to communicate and allowed civilization to exist.So the Silent were important to have, but it was also important to keep them under control. So when a boy is found to be a super-Silent at the same time the Dream is starting to break apart, fear starts to overwhelm reason. Governments will kill to have him. They're even willing to go to war for him.Somebody better do something fast, before the Dream is lost and civilization is lost with it!"
3,"Good Tools, Not Great.","I'm an IT director by day.But the rest of the time, Hi, my name is Michael, and I'm a tool junkie. I'd like to think not a tool snob. I own both professional quality tools as well as these ""Crappy"" Denali tools.I bought this set to keep in my car. My daily driver, I have 2 others. Ok, Car junkie too.My car has an extensive tool kit built into the trunk, but there are some things on car repair that are so much easier with a socket.The car is an 86 BMW, and I probably work on it about every other weekend.The price was fair, especially with SuperSaverShipping.The rachet is sort of so, so. But the sockets themselves make this a very passable tool kit. They are nicely labeled and nice and tight on any bolt I have put them too. Case is convenient, I broke one of the closers off the second time I worked on my car."
2,"Estilo unico, historia sin mucho interes hoy",Lo compre por la fama tan grande que tiene Lorca pero no logre entrar en las historia. Lorca es sin duda un grande por su estilo y su tecnica elaborada pero la historia paso demasiado a segundo plano para mi gusto y quizas ya no me parecio como relevante hoy.
3,walk to the edge,"Kim Robinson tries to paint a picture of society as Utopian as a society might be. It fulfills many of the ideals of Adam Smith and early free market theory: no business seems big enough to influence market prices or supplies on its own. Everyone has freedom. It isn't a perfect Utopia. We learn through excerpts of one of the characters' diaries that society as we know it had gotten really nasty, so some young folks saved the whole thing and made America into some kind of Utopia. Now college students from India resent this, feeling the reforms were America's way of pulling the rug out from under them before they got a chance to kick America's butt on the hypothetical free market. Oh well.As the story unfolds the absence of red herrings becomes apparent. None of the characters watch television or hang out at the mall. They don't have Mcdonalds or sports cars. All they do is drink beer and play baseball. Is this really a world we can live with?"
5,Best I have ever had..,Love this litter bag for my car...but it took me weeks to find another one for our new car....after shopping at all the auto parts stores...I found them at office depot...yeah!!
4,Pretty and handy,"This little book has six pre-cut stencils of leaves. Printed on sturdy cardstock and clearly labeled, the stencils are the perfect size for most projects. I've used them to paint and etch designs on jars and mugs, and to create a set of pillowcases and sheets. Included here are a sweet gum leaf, a maple leaf, a yellow poplar leaf, a holly leaf, a white oak leaf, and an aspen leaf."
2,Stencil Mania leaves,I really didn't like these stencils. I like the stencils with more details unless you want to add your own details.
4,just 4 because I just bough them,"I bought a condo loft place and the entire place came with Halogen bulbs.. I am personally not a huge fan of LED's or their Price... plus.. call me weird, but I love how CFL's look.. So, I was able to replace the entire lighting of my condo with these. they work great!"
3,Chrome tail Pipe,You must measure very carefully to order the correct size. Had to use Midas to install it because the pipe I purchased was too small. Also noticed that the stainless steel changed color after a few trips. Purchased on Amazon.
4,Interesting Italian Giallo/Psycho-thriller,"This isn't a giallo in the traditional sense. Those looking for a movie like DEEP RED or WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? will be disappointed.What we have is a movie like Polanski's REPULSION. This is a movie about psychosis. I didn't think I was going to like this one because I generally enjoy the more straight-forward killer-with-a-razor type of Italian thriller. But this was really good. It's probably more of a 3.5 out of 5 instead of 4 but I think that one-starred review is uncalled for. Though THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK is not a classic, it's still creepy and unsettling.. especially the ending.Recommended for Italian horror fans.-Jordan Krall, author of the spaghetti western/giallo FISTFUL OF FEET"
1,SONY NPF70,"Bad battery, defective, not good at all for MicroMV Cameras like SONY DCR IP5 or IP7, go fo NPF-71 InfoLITHIUM as a replacement"
2,Bad quality - you get what you pay for,Got it FAR thanks giving day. Have used about half the pack and had about 7-8 coasters. And that too in a BENQ.
3,A book of mixed quality,This is a book that will be great if you allready have another book about the Luftwaffe to complement it. While it has Pictures and short descriptions of every aircraft in the Luftwaffe except a few very early types that are grouped under their own chapter.This book isn't really as exact as I expected if contains no tech sheet on any aircraft describing it's performance. The text can be very frustrating at times when is say the next model has a greater bomb load but don't tell how big that bombload is.However the vast number of aircraft described in it makes up for some of that and although it's 2 books bolted together as one (1 about Fighters and 1 about Bombers) it has a nice weight in your hands and looks very nice in the bookshelf.
4,Probably not for your first encounter with Plato,"The Symposium is great for those who are more familiar with Plato's writings. I wouldn't start here, though; maybe start with the Socratic dialogues and then move to the Republic."
5,Great looking bowling ball bag,It's good have an extra bowling ball and extra storages for your bowling needs. Highly recommended if you're starting enjoying the game.
5,Vinyl review,"Even on the cheaper vinyl this brings me back. The Clash was the 1st show I ever saw. The sound is absolute, pure Clash, Buy the vinyl"
4,Love The Clash!,Haven't heard them in awhile and amazed that I can still buy them on vinyl. Great gift! My son is a teenager and he loves The Clash! That means the 80s definitely rules!
5,Great for the 2008 Ford Edge !,"These set of locks are great! They fit my Ford Edge's 18"" wheels perfectly. The key has an odd pattern that prevents thieves with other keys from removing the locks. The locks are well made and extremely sturdy. I could not even create a mark on these locks with a hacksaw! Just remember to keep the key somewhere in your car that a thief would not think to look for it.. Like, in an airvent or under the cushion of your rear seats. Overall, McGard makes of h@#$ of a set of locks! Buy TWO sets for extra security... (( Although, you probably won't need it! ))"
1,Locks were cheap pot metal and broke after 10 months,"Purchased a set of 24198 locks for a Ford Edge. The dealer reported they were the wrong locks for the vehicle - 1/2 x 20, although specified by McGard & Ford for the Edge. The dealer sheared off the top 1/4' removing the lock revealing a rusted out pot metal lock.Very strange. Called McGard customer service, who said they were the correct locks, didn't know why they sheared off and were not very helpful at all. Said to buy a new set. The locks were 10 month old. Used to be a good product, but looks like China junk now."
1,Dee dee dee,"Literally, it's a list of 50 sentences about Carlos Mencia, and a few of them are repetitive (one ""thing"" is that Carlos has 18 brothers and sisters; another ""thing"" is that he has 11 sisters and 7 brothers - we could have done the math and skipped the first ""thing'). Check out the original magazine's website - why buy the cow when you can get the milk..."
5,never heard of an album as good as this one,"When I heard lagwagon for the first time, I was surprised of it's fine guitarwork. In fact, I had never heard of a punkband as good as this one. It changed my view on the punkscene today completely. Never knew punk could be so good. Ever scince I've known this band I only listen to punk. On the album is lagwagon excusing theirselves for the bad recordings... Strange, I don't think there are any bad recordings at all on this album. Lagwagon is a punkband I recommend to all those that are even just a tiny little bit into punk. BUY IT and you will never regret it!!!!"
1,GAG,"Sugary, marshmallow power-pop for kids who are too ""underground"" for Blink182. You call this punk? I call it a bubblegum novelty item. Anyone over 12 who listens to this ought to be ashamed of themselves."
4,Great Resource for ACT! 2000 Users,Mayer has combined his experience with ACT! in a useful guide that takes you beyond keystrokes. He helps you understand how to use ACT! to manage your day and make more money. (This reviewer is an ACT! Certified Consultant and a specialist in Customer Relationship Managerment)
5,sure sure,"bought this book on a whim, okay book, lots of myths you have probably never heard of before, nothing intensely exciting, good for a few flips while dropping some dooks."
4,Jerusalem Arise,Arrived on time with a cracked case but the cd was undamaged enjoying the songs on the cd very much
5,The most anointed music I have heard in a long time.,"There are not enough words in my vocabulary to express what a truly blessed and wonderful work this is. This is by far the most anointed music I have heard in a long time. After listening to this I have a deeper appreciation of the scripture that talks about how the L-RD inhabits the praises of Israel.During the song Kadosh (Holy), close your eyes and tell me you can't invision the throne of G-d, the angels,elders and sainted ones round about. I felt as if I were literally in the Holy of Holies.Simply and incredible CD."
1,A waste of money,"I don't know what the other two reviewers are talking about. I'm brand-spanking new to the lapsteel and I've gotten better information than this DVD provides off of YouTube and [...]. The instruction is slow, boring and unlikely to be worth a second watching (if that). The chapters of this disc are as follows:1. String Guages2. 6 String Tuning3. 8 String Tuning4. Picks5. Bar Control6. F-Chord7. Blocking/Mute8. Action Zone (How to hold the steel)9. Vibrato10. Count Up (Single String Scale)11. Picking Exercises12. A-Track13. Scale Exercises14. Part of a Scale15. Blues Lick16. Harmonic Chimes17. 7ths18. F-TrackStay away. If you really want a copy, I'll sell you mine for a song."
3,Good but could be better,"I am new to lap steel but not to playing guitar. I've purchased other guitar instructional dvds over the years from various other companies. The Georgeboards dvd is absolutely helpful especially for a beginner. BUT, I think it should include tab sheets to illustrate EXACTLY what he is doing on screen. It's great to watch and try to follow along, but when you get confused or lost it would be nice to refer to a printed tab and 'see' what the heck he's doing. That is my only complaint. I still would recommend this to anyone starting out on lap steel and I will probably purchase another of his dvds in the future."
2,OK.....,"Tho there is a lot of material, there is no organization to the lesson flow.A LOT of the ""lessons"" are just him jamming with little to no explanation of what you are seeing on the screen.Tho no where near as bad a rip off as the Lil Steel Volume 1 Songbook from steel guitar mojo, it is still not worth the $$."
2,Gave me Achilles tendon problems,"These are fine for occasional use, but when I used them for hours of hiking, I injured my Achilles tendons badly."
3,"Beautiful pictures, information lacking","I love to collect books of house plans and blueprints and I especially like those that are environmentally friendly. Some day my family wants to afford to build such a nice house so these give us ideas. However, that only really works if we have full information -- like what types of materials are used, layouts of the floors that we can read, etc. Several, about 40% of the designs in this book lacked understandable or complete basic blueprints for the structure. Only a page or two about the building and the philosophy behind it were included. Primarily this is a pretty picture book and for $30 it should be more."
3,Touched by an Angel too.,"This was a very good book about Angel experiences with the author and a few other people. I also believe Angels are sent from God to protect His people. I'm not so sure you can contact them, but they are definitely sent to protect people."
5,Wanna Sing? Highly recommended!!!,"Don Moen is trully blessed and gifted in worship songs. And you know what is amazing? His music tells 'us' we are all as blessed and gifted as he is, if only we would sing out to the LORD! Listening to this CD (I Will Sing) reminds me to worship and praise God even in my darkest hour.Listen to this CD and keep the faith alive cos God is always FAITHFUL and HE will NEVER let you down!"
4,What's the deal with this DVD?,"I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it. But why is it coming to DVD now (November 2010)? Is it because *another* Stones concert flick (""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones"") is being issued on DVD this month (October 2010)? Hmmm... Is Lionsgate trying to make a quick buck? Also, has this movie been remastered for DVD? No mention of it. Also, why have they subtitled it ""Greatest Hits Live""? That was never in the original movie promotions... It's not even on the VHS version. Bad, Lionsgate, bad."
5,Rocking All Over the USA,"I bought this on VHS tape oh so many years ago. I've been waiting for ages to get this on DVD and here it finally is. If you remotely like the Stones, this is worth getting. You get a good sense of how much fun they are live. This DVD shows them in all their ragged glory; sloppy, loose, yet compulsive to look at and hear. I just love their music. Long live the Stones!"
3,Best for rabid Stones Fans,"If you're even thinking of renting/buying this, see Ladies & Gentlemen the Rolling Stones first!The trouble w/ this tour was Jagger's absurd costume. To see a skinny 40-yr-old man singing in yellow football pants & pink tank-top is just painful. Also at these stadium gigs, Jagger ran around so much that his vocals are consistently hoarse & off-key. He hadn't learned to pull this off yet. His singing is much better on DVD's from the 90's & beyond. Music fans know that Keith & Ronnie no longer used Ampeg amps, so the classic 70's wall of guitar sound is gone. I'm sure there were good shows from this tour, as Tattoo You was the last truly classic Stones album, but this is not it. Can't wait to see the 1978 Texas show that is being released in October 2011."
3,"Didn't see this movie (yet), but a correction for Natasha Conn...",Hal Ashby did not direct AGAINST ALL ODDS. That was directed by Taylor Hackford. Ashby did direct 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE (his last film) which also starred Jeff Bridges. Perhaps that's the film you're thinking of.
2,Stones flop,I have been a Stones fan for the last 42 years and this DVD is the Stones at their worst. A few songs are good but overall a bit of a disappointment.
1,One good song and that is it...,"Saw the original release in the theater. Mick does a passionate, almost sad version of ""Time Is On My Side."" This is from the beginning of their worst period. Not only the worst rock concert they have released, it's just plain boring as a movie.For a few bucks more you can get ""Ladies and Gentleman...."""
1,Music bad.,I bought this on import and I consider it a waste of money. I was excited about the song selection but I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the Stones live versions of old rock-n-roll classics twenty flight rock and going to a go-go on their live album of the same time but the versions on this film are terrible. I sold this to a used cd/dvd store at a big loss because I knew I would never watch it again. Avoid!
4,I'm Overrating it,"I am the Stones Authority. This is the tour in support of Tattoo You. The first tour that I was able to see them live. Football stadiums and Jagger in a football jersey. Look, at the current Amazon price of $9.47 it is absolutely worth it. But seeing the Stones in a football stadium - either in person or on video - is not ideal. The set list is pretty good, the audio is pretty good and the fact that the back half of the video is from a performance at an indoor arena mixes it up a bit and gives you another vantage point to take in the live experience that is the Stones. It is not a bad video, but it is not great. But it was all we had for the longest time. Now it pales in comparison to recent concert releases, such as the ""Some Girls"" DVD."
3,Oh where to begin,"I have quite a few mixed emotions about this dvd concert. I knew this concert was shot in the 80s so I am not suprised by the awful fashion the boys display. My problem was with the unrelenting speed and frenetic pacing of virtually all the performances. the whole show was pure adrenalin and not because it was so great but because the band never seem to slow down, it had a go go go feel all the way through. Another problem I had was during the song time is on my side. The band does very well on this one, unfortunatly the viewer is treated to disturbing graphic war footage while the song is being performed. This was really crude tacky and out of place. The stones are without question one of the top five rock bands ever, and while there were dissapointments with this concert, The stones did just well enough here to not make it a complete atrosity."
4,Edgy,"Great DVD for all rock fans, not just Stones fans. This dvd is a fantastic document of a rock band when rock bands were rock bands-- thin, edgy, cocky, chain smoking, dangerous, and a bit sloppy. In a world dominated by safe and suburban ""artists"", a la American Idol--well fed, white toothed, vapid karaoke entertainers-- it's refreshing to watch a real rock band at work."
5,Going To A Go-Go '81 Style,This was a very exciting release for The Rolling Stones in 1982. It was released in theatres in the US and was great on the big screen. They played it loud & it was as close to the band as you could get at the time. I for one had a great time watching it & the packed theatre was screaming for more!The Stones Played Live & Raw...And The Energy Was certainly There! Jagger Alone was Running at least three miles a Show! It was A kick ass tour and They Learned Alot From that tour about playing in huge stadiums & making adjustments to deliver the sound (especially in stadiums).They know better than most that there's alot of ways to deliver a tune & That Tour was a learning experience for many bands to follow. Four Flicks Wouldn't be as great if it were not for this ground breaking tour..(Live & Learn)The Year: 1981 / The Album: Tatto You / The Tour:The Rolling Stones Playing Live Raw Rock n Roll (In Huge Stadiums)..Not An Easy Task!
5,Stones version of totally 80's,"As bizarre and varied as the 80's music scene was, the Stones remained a force. This film captures the period perfectly. Straight rock n roll, no back up singers or 12 piece back up band, the Stones crank it out with high energy in your face rock. Ron Woods never played better, his solo on ""you cant always"" is nothing short of devastating. The band looks like they are having a blast, even Bill Wyman cracks a smile watchin Mick dance. 23 songs clocking in at 87 mins is a great deal for this dvd. Just a lot of fun to watch this again."
2,BEWARE:TRANSFER SPED UP A KEY!,"Could of been one the best of the stones dvd's out there,but someone (one of the stones or producers?) decided to speed up the complete concert up a key! If you are not a musician or dont have relative pitch you might not notice so much,but something will just not sound right.You've heard all these great songs before many times,but not in a raised key.Charlie Watts plays most songs faster live anyway,but here they sound just wrong.Want proof,just try playing a keyboard (like Ian & Stu) along with the dvd.A sharp,C sharp,G sharp...it nevered happened in the stones world.Plus the speeded up transfer makes them sound like chipmonks! A disgrace to stone fans.You are warned!"
2,Has not aged well,"If this was the only film/video document of the '81 tour, you might be inclined to see it as a down time in the band's long stage career. A much better video tour document is from the bootleg Hampton, Virginia show on Keith's 38th birthday, December 18th, 1981. That show was televised on a pay per view basis. Good bootlegs can be found at various flea markets that blow 'Let's Spend the Night Together' away. Maybe someday the Stones will release an official version of the Hampton, Virginia concert."
2,Too Many Edits,"I bought this for safe keeping, figuring the VHS copy I had would eventually become unplayable. Unfortunately, for some reason the space between most of the songs is 5 to 10 seconds shorter than it was on the VHS. I assume this was done to fit the movie to a single DVD. I would have rather that the introduction of the band members, the lead in, the ending, or even one complete song be edited out. Had that been done, this DVD would have flowed alot more like a concert."
3,Not the greatest of Stones' performances,"The Stones seemed burnt out during the 1981 tour. I've seen better Stones performances in more recent years. I remember watching this video years ago on HBO. Good dvd to have if you are a Stones fan, but knowing what was going on behind the scenes at the time. It isn't the best depiction of the greatest rock 'n roll band in the world. I felt the band was just going through the motions, and I don't feel the energy that I felt when I was the Stones in 1999 and 2002."
3,THIS FILM HAS BEEN REFORMATTED FROM IT'S ORIGINAL VERSION,"Well this could have been so much better if not for the fact it has been cropped to give it the widescreen format. This was originally released in full screen as I have both the original vhs and brazillian dvd. Talk about mis-leading! I mean come on, I could've set it to cropped on my hd tv to fill the screen but why even freakin bother? Also the sound is not quite as good as my vhs tape either. With my set-up I am able to compare the vhs and dvd side by side so trust me on this.If you don't already have this then I would say no true Stones fan should pass it up as it's still a great show and truly captures the band right before all the extra musicians were brought in to fill the gaps as the boys aged into old geezers."
5,I only have 6 Waits Albums...,"...and this one, so different from his Weill stuff, it just gets me. One of my top five favorite records ever.So romantic, and so well-put in the poetry. Apart from the obvious winners, ""Ruby's Arms,"" ""Jersey Girl,""""On The Nickel,"" and ""Downtown,"" there's so much fun with ""Mr. Siegal"" and the title track. An absolutelyexcellent piece of work, even if Mr. Waits ain't your regular chaw musically."
4,This stuff'll probably kill you....let's do another line...,"...thought you said you'd meet me down on Heartattack and Vine. Now who can resist a song like this? Heartattack and Vine is Tom Waits at his most basic musical setup. He's doing the guitar, bass, and drums setup for the majority. But have no fear, he tickles the ivories on Ruby's Arms and Saving All My Love for You. Perhaps the most catchy little ditty on this album is Mr. Siegal. It's a bluesy rocker, and with a first line like ""I spent all my money...in a Mexican whorehouse...across the street from a Catholic church. Now that is poetry in motion. Furthermore, like the song Jersey Girl that Springsteen made famous? Well its here too--by the original artist."
3,Jersey Girl and Heart attack.,"The Title track will keep you ""Jersey Girl"" will make you wipe your eyes and ""On the Nickel"" will make you a life long Waits fan. This album is'nt as good as many Waits albums are but it is still a must have even if you just buy the tape."
5,waits' finest moment,"this cd is not waits' best, but it contains my # 1 favorite song of his, ""on the nickle."" buy this cd just for that one song, and you will not be disappointed."
4,Maybe Not His Best . . .,". . . but still pretty good. More like an overview of Waits' career to this point (1980), there are gravelly rockers, weepy ballads & creepy characters galore. For my money, I like BLUE VALENTINE & SMALL CHANGE much better, but if you're like most people taking the time to listen to Waits at all, then you probably have those already. Might as well keep everything nice and completist and grab this one, too. For the price, you really can't go wrong.And then there's Act II in this guy's ongoing drama, which is a whole 'nother can 'o beans . . ."
5,One of Tom Waits' Best,"I am not a fan of everything Tom Waits does, but this album is packed with great songs. If you're looking for a first Tom Waits album to buy, this one and ""Closing Time"" are recommended."
4,Another essential CD by Tom Waits,"This disc contains a more conventional work that still holds Waits great style. It features Ruby's Arms, one of the most beautiful songs by Waits, in which he shows his talents both as a writer and also as very competent singer. Although it is a whole good record, the song Ruby's Arms alone would make it worthwhile."
1,vinyl tubing,"They shipped the tubing in a box with huge staples, one of which pierced the tubing, causing air and water leaks, and making the product useless for me. When I asked to return it, they told me I'd have to eat the shipping, and they'd only pay for the item refunded. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this company, or it's products because of this! Now I have to resell it, with the damaged part cut off."
5,content,"Showed up on time. great quality, it works quite well for what i'm using it for. i'm very satisfied with the product and the price was reasonable."
5,Good quality clear vinyl tubing,"Product was attached to pool cover pump. Performed well, with no kinking or internal collapse of tube while draining pool cover water."
1,terible,"I really thought this cd was something else, something I heard on Michigan Public Radio. This cd is just boring, simple beats, and just terrible lyrics. They are trite along with the beats. I tried really hard to like it because it took me forever to get it, but I just can't. It isn't bad if you just want to shake your head up and down but I want more than that in my cd player. Enless you know what your buying, do not get this cd."
2,Slight Short Stories-Stick to Prince Valiant,"I have to confess that I was very dissapointed with the three volumes of the Bois-Maury series. As a category of creative fiction, Franco-Belgian graphic novels have a very good reputation. Hermann is famous as one of the better known author/illustrators. But in the final analysis, the three books of this series are not really novels. They are more similar to not very well thought out short stories. The artwork was decent but could not save very slight short stories to which the art is tied. If you are interested in historical graphic novels, stick to Hal Foster's Prince Valiant books. Foster's artwork is superior and he had the time and space to tell substantial stories."
5,Heavy Metal Supreame,This is an excellent CD. The lead singer Michela D'Orlando is amazing. Her strong voice and operactic ability give this CD a very unique sound.
5,Still Rocks,"Hey, I have not listened to Gary in over 15 years, all I know this 55yr. old still rocks better than anyone. If you want a great blues-rock album this is a great place to start."
5,Pleased,Was having transmission slippage problems and a combination of stop leak fluid and Royal Purple ATF has cleared-up the problem for the last 3 months. Very pleased.
1,A bad copy made on a broken copy-machine,Inside the book looks like a bad copy made on a broken copy-machine. Black and white and not easy to read too. It is better to look for a real book for this price.Returning the item for a refund.
2,Can get the same info free from the Amer Heart Assc brochure,"Our baby was born 6 months ago with heart defects. Though I'm sure Ms. Wild is well intentioned, this book provides no more information than the American Heart Association's free publication on Congenital Heart Defects in Children, which our Doctors gave us the day of our baby's diagnosis (that pub is easy to read, geared towards parents). Ms.Wild's book contains very ""surface level"" information. Believe me, as a parent with a baby that has CHD, we want more information. I was disappointed, and I'm sorry but I can not recommend that parents of children with heart defects purchase this book. We're still in search of a good pub that provides more information."
5,Good reference.,We purchased copies of this book for our families to use as reference for their child's diagnosis.Children's of Alabama now has a new pediatric cardiac unit and families need all the information they can get.
4,Better than the Pacific,"In this set, all of the episodes were not only complete but they were colorized pretty well. I'd recommend this one as a decent enough set for the ""WW II European Theater"" because only part of the episodes cover the Battle of the Alantic. A very good price as well but unless a revised (corrected version) of the same series concentrating on the Pacific/Far Eastern replaces the one I have, avoid this if you want a set."
5,Music that makes your hair stand up!,"I do not have to go to the barbershop for the next three weeks after listening to this hair raising music. Being an old Swedish rock n roll fan it is like a juvenile injection. I love it. Do they have six stars? Okey, then five stars for a rockabilly lone star!"
3,Use only if you have High Speed Internet,Basically the same as version 20. BUT the Art Gallery is kind of a pain. Most of the images are online and download as you click on them. If you have Dial up you will be in for a frustrating wait.
1,Print Shop Design Suite,"The product was shipped in a timely manner. It was exactly what it was advertised as...old version. Within a few weeks, I replaced with the newer version even though I have an older computer."
1,junk - do not buy!!!!,"This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor."
3,must have album,"The album is just great, but i give 3 stars because of the sound quality is a little dissapointing (taken from vinyl and sounds like a cd from the mid-eighties), the original masters are gone??.Every serious soul fan should have the song ""what about my love"" in his collection though."
4,"Miasma, natural and concrete sounds.","Progressive rock is a wide term to be applied to certain rock bands but this band meets all the necessary characteristics to be one of a kind. An incredible likeness to many of my favorite bands and at the same time an absolute originality give audiences the freshness of a new start and taste. This is definitely a great band and should be in many hands that appreciate good music. The fusion of piano, violin, guitar, and many other instruments almost create a sense of discomfort when you find yourself trying to locate their music at a specific period of time. Check it out yourself and do not let my words spoiled your own judgment."
4,A maturing band,"By 1941 the Bradley/McKinley band was moving from the boogie-woogie style of the 1930s into a far more rounded and versatile outfit. Bradley's trombone playing is as effortless and ever, and McKinley's drumming as dynamic and driving as ever, and now supported by good arrangements and vocalists. This is a well-recorded set of numbers which showcases the talents of what was in effect a duo-led band offering swing dance music of a high order at a time when the music business was jam-packed with high quality name bands at their peak. The Bradley/McKinley band certainly holds its' own in such illustrious company."
1,The Very Best of Larry Clinton & His Orchestra,"Even though we've paid our credit card bill after ordering this product it was NEVER SHIPPED. How dishonest is that!It was reportedly not available, but you NEVER ISSUED CREDIT TO OUR ACCOUNT. You had reported that it would be shipped January 31, 2007 - it's now April 11, 2007. NO PRODUCT - NO CREDIT."
3,s'ok,"This is another logitech webcam which doubles as a digital camera. The webcam is able to record video and still images, but NO SOUND. Although the 310 is a basic webcam model, it has one feature, it can double as a digital camera. Just unplug it, and take it away from the computer for all your eBay photographs, or other photo emergency uses when you don't have a better digital camera around. The camera holds 2Mb worth of images. You need 4 AAA batteries to turn the webcam into a digital camera. The swivel base on which the plastic webcam normally sits doubles as the docking port for downloading images from the digital camera. There is no LCD screen for you to preview images when you take them, just a simple viewfinder, so beware of parallax errors when you snap something close up."
4,"Buy if, Do not buy if...","Buy this product if you're looking for a way to do video-chats, but it does not produce very good quality pictures."
1,Poor picture quality,"The picture quality of this webcam is best described as one you might expect from a low-end webcam you bought 2-3 years ago! Very disappointing and the extra features as a digital camera/video clip camera are only frills to hide this fact. With picture quality so bad, none of the extra features matter anyway.I absolutely would recommend buyers to look at other alternatives. If you receive this as a gift, see if you can return it to the store!!"
2,cheap option for neophytes,"let's face it, you're not going to get a lot of camera for the money involved, but what you do get is a passable webcam which doubles as a very low-end stand alone digital camera which can be used for happy snaps in good outdoor conditionsmy 9 y.o. daughter likes it, and i like the idea of giving her the chance to fire off pics indisciminately for the cost of 4 aaa batteries - a much superior option to film and processing costs for a beginner to experiment, and faster opportunity to view the images they create and encourage consideration of what does and what doesn't work technically and artisticallyif you want a real digital camera then go and buy one, but you won't get it for this price; as a cheap beginner's equivalent to a very basic instamatic (with webcam capabilities as an added bonus), this is definitely worth consideration"
3,Average...,"I got this camera a few years ago as a gift. It worked well enough (especially as a webcam) until one day it wouldn't turn on. It would go on like this, turning on when it felt like it and I got fed up when it refused to work when I NEEDED it to take a pic to prove that my car was illegally towed. I finally got the thing to work, but swore against it after that. It still doesn't work when I want it to but at least the resolution is better than the rubbish Micro Innovations webcam I replaced it with. The HP digital camera that came after it is a dream."
4,Being Nothingness,"I just finished this book maybe 5 minutes ago and am so impressed with it. A fasciniating story with a real sting in its tail. I left one star off for the occasional lapses into overwritten philosophy quoting, but it's an intriguing and provoking book"
4,An Old Favorite,"I recently moved back home, and started digging through my books. Lo and behold, I found an old, tattered copy of ""My Sister Mike."" I re-read it fondly, and it really is a fantastic book. Keep in mind that it was written in the 50s, so it does not present the most forward thinking viewpoint for a young girl, but all in all it was one of my favorites growing up."
5,Favorite Pre-teen Book,"I loved this book when I was growing up. I know the message is a bit outdated, but I remember thinking that this girl could be cute and since I actually had a little sister that was a cheerleader, I totally related to Mike.I don't know if I would share it with a little girl of today, but I would let my friends borrow it."
2,hmmm,I got this album just for deliverance bcsuse I couldn't find just deliverance by itself. Really don't care for the rest of the album very much
4,End of the series,"The final series is a good season but also a little sad.The show keeps its funny antics and hilarious relationship between Ranma and Akane till the very end. My only problem with the 7th season is that its ending is rather dissapionting. Also,that the end doesnt stick with how the books end. But I suppose they had a reason for ending it the way they did. Its a great season, perfect for all Ranma 1/2 fans."
5,A Jamming CD that's pure R & R,"Saw these guys several times now LIVE and the CD does not dissapoint! All the dynamic energy, guitar walls, and smashing vocals make this the CD you have to have this summer! Amazing layers of sound for such a young band! Very tight .These guys are the next big thing! My fav tracks are ""MISERY"", ""The Corner"" and ""Southside Stomp""! This band melts faces!"
3,For Fans,"For Clarence Fountain fans to add to your collection, this will do. I was looking for something a little different. But, it is Clarence Fountain."
4,WOW!,What can I say? One of the best indy pop releases of the year. Right up there with anyhting that 4AD has ever released. A great CD!
2,Bucketless!,"Just because the item's description is 360t bucket doesn't guarantee a bucket anymore! You'll receive 360 pieces of dubble bubble in a shipping box. So if you where hoping to store them in the bucket, buy something else."
5,A great value,I use this to give out to kids of a sunday school class I teach. The kids love it and look forward to getting a piece every week.
5,Fabulous Acoustic Guitar,"I found this album so refreshing and renewing to the mind and spirit. This is one CD that I can't get enough of. I was given the album by a friend and had no idea what to expect when I placed it into my cd player; within the first minute I had fallen in love with the sound and had been taken to an entirely new world. Rober Sequoia's music is filled with life and inspiration. I would highly recomend this cd to anyone who enjoys (or just sort of likes) the melodic sounds of the acoustical guitar. For those who find they like this cd, try his latest album: ""Full Moon."" ""Compassion"" is as good as ""Essence"" because it has the same songs on it with two new compositions added to it. Both albums are well worth listening to though."
4,Great knife,Bought this as a Christmas present and the recepient was very happy with it. Will be buying more in the future.
4,buck 105 pathfinder,"recieved merchandise as indicated in excellentcondition. haven't had chance to use the product yet, but i am looking forward to many years of good use. i would recommend the site and appreciate the service rendered. i was skeptical, since the description did not indicate the sheath was included, but that doubt was cleared upon arrival. packaged well for shipment.thank you for your promptness in delivering a good product!!"
3,Ok text for beginners,"I am currently teaching a class using this text. I think that it is OK- but I personally would prefer Stallings or Tanenbaum. Stallings and Tanenbaum are much more engineering or technically oriented.I have come across a number of small annoying errors in Forouzan's text, as well as a number of opinions that he puts out as facts. Of course I wouldn't be annoyed if his opinions and mine agreed - but he could at least properly identify them. This mostly is a problem with what technologies are ""winners"" or ""losers"" in the marketplace, or what dificulties are presented with trying to implement some of the protocols mentioned.If you want to know how stuff really works go with Stallings or Tanenbaum. If you want to know how to communications is used by a business - there are a number of other texts that are far better. I feel like this text is half-way in between. Unfortunately I am unable to change what text we are using here..."
5,A Seminal Text,"This book is one of the great texts on the subjects covered. It has been a required text for two undergraduate and one (so far) graduate class that I have taken.Mr. Forouzan's prose is clear and his examples understandable. The only thing that might make portions of this book a difficult read for some people is the complexity of some of the material covered. The book starts at the electrical (Manchester encoding, NRZ, etc.), and gradually builds until the networking process is clear, top to bottom. In terms of completeness, I have not seen another book that covers everything from the LAN to the WAN like this book. Also included are related topics like cellular networks, PSTN, encryption, and even the application layer of the OSI model. The complete OSI model is covered with great depth."
2,Plastic does not hold up!,I bought this holder to hang a Swiffer. It lasted about 6 months and then cracked and will not hold it anymore. It might work fine for a broom.
1,Not satisfied,Does not grip the broom at all to hold it up. We have had one before which worked. This one doesn't work.
1,Did not work for my mop or broom.,I've had a hard time finding a single broom holder. I thought this would be perfect. It did not hold my broom or mop with a metal stick. They slid right out. The metal sticks are a slightly smaller circumference than the wooden sticks. This product probably works fine for those.
3,Okay Product,"This holder installed nicely. The only con is that with a slippery broom handle it doesn't hold it in place very well. I have a slippery handled broom. So when I put it away it tends to slide down which is not what it's supposed to do. It's supposed to stay put because of the rubber. Anyway, my broom has a plastic hook at the end which is larger than the handle so it doesn't ever fall out of the holder, but that is the only problem I seem to be having with it. Hence the 3 star review."
5,used on side of freezer in Gargage,"Needed something I could mount on the side of the freezer in the garage. This is perfect. It is holding a brush we use to wash cars with,"
1,No one should bother with this book,"I waited with great expectation for ""Great Moments in Architecture"" to arrive, hoping it would be in the style of the other highly successful books by David MacCaulay on Pyramids, ships, etc. These other books provide something for all ages: detailed drawings on how things work for children and sophisticated studies of engineering and architecture for adults.Unfortunately, Great Moments is a satirical look at great objects of aechitecture. The cover shows L'Arc de Triumph upside down and called Arc de Defeat. The remainder of the book only gets worse.The problem is the work is totally confusing for children who are trying to learn the true nature of the world while being boringly crude for adults.However, I suppose if you would like an expensive and not funny Architectural Far Side, maybe this would provide some brief enjoyment"
5,Philosophical whimsy in song,"Michael Leunig is an Aussie gem who should be better known in the U.S. A philosophical poet/satirist/cartoonist/artist, his wit is sharp, his heart open, and he manages with simple line drawings to gently expose our current human condition--love, death, politics, war... This set contains a small book of his illustrated poems to read alone or along with Gyan and her friends. The combination is beautiful melancholy tinged with hope. ""Make a steamy compost of your fears/Trickle irrigate your life with tears"" and live in wonderment of it all. Unique and highly recommended."
3,It's ok,"Wasn't as informative as I thought it would be. The section on love food was good, but I wish other topics were written on with the same gusto: maybe food that increases money, or something."
1,Disappointed Item never arrived,"I have two Master Levels, which I bought locally, and tried to order a third directly from the Master Level company. The item never arrived even after contacting the seller by email and twice on the phone. After waiting six weeks, I finally cancelled the order. I wouldn't recommend trying to buy the product directly from the seller."
3,thank you :),I'm just glad to buy the good stuff at a good price.thank you so much happy new yearbye~:)
3,Good Stopper But Not Utensil Guard,"I bought this over another one that was just a utensil guard because this one was also a stopper. The stopper works great but when in the utensil guard position, it always slips down and stops up the sink instead. I actually still like and use it, but it would have been nice for it to work exactly like it was advertised. It was a little hard for me to put the rubber gaskets on, but since they need to be the correct size and need to be tight, I'm not sure what else could have been done.It was difficult for me to put 3 or 4 stars, so consider this a 3.5 star rating."
3,Not entirely satified with this product,"This item would work much better for me if it were longer. The throat of my disposal is too long to be able to push food down the splashguard without the stopper stopping up the sink. However, since I didn't have a stopper for the disposal side, I am glad to have a stopper that works and holds water in that side of the sink when I need it. So, I guess I'd have to say that it ""halfway"" works for me."
5,Handy. Dandy. Happy Scrappy.,"It works. What more can I say? It work, works well, and to wash well periodically I remove the washers and toss the core into the dishwater. It fits standard disposal openings in the sink.Good price for a good product, one of that that make you ask, ""Why didn't I think of that???"""
1,I should have bought a Disposal genie,This product is too light weight and cheeply made. I have sence bought a Disposal Genie and I have found it to work much better.
2,Blocks water from going down drain.,"Tried this one instead of replacing my ""super-stuffer"" and I really don't like it at all in comparison. If you have to keep removing it to let the water drain, that defeats the purpose of preventing other things from going into the disposal. I'm getting another super-stuffer right now!"
4,Simple and effective,"I got one of these when we replaced our disposal and now I can't stand not having one. It's a scraper, a drain plug and a drain guard that keeps small items out of the disposal. The number of times Mr. Scrappy has saved me from fishing stuff out of the disposal makes it more than worth the price -- and it makes a good drain plug too. Will it change your life in some dramatic way? No. But it does remove some hassle and a few bits of clutter. They last about one year with normal wear and tear, and I can't find them in stores."
5,BLOWN AWAY!!!,"Seth James is amazing! Heard the local DJ's raving about him, so decided to check him out. This guy is unbelievable, best guitar playing since Stevie Ray Vaughn and Santana, and his voice ain't bad either ;)! Super nice guy too, very friendly. Got my autographed CD on the spot, think I listened to it non-stop for 2 months, and it never leaves my CD changer. I see him live every chance I get!! FYI--His wife is in the biz too, back up singer for Texas artist Cory Morrow"
1,Confused myself...,According to the Dell and Sony sites;- this kit does contain the same battery used in the new 500 series.- appears to contain the same CD-RW's used in the 500's.- Assuming that the older models are the same approximate size as the new one the bag should hold it too.- Both sites list this item as being an accessory for the 500 model.All I can determine is that the packageing hasn't been updated since the arrival of the new 500's.I've ordered one from Dell - I'll let you know how it goes.
1,MAVICA STARTER KIT,Very misleading add. Thought I was ordering the kit for a floppy and was sent the CD version instead. Had to return twice. Still haven't received the correct one.
4,"OK as a mystery, not as a romance","I would not call this a romance novel. It is primarily mystery and suspense with some paranormal magic and a little sex for garnish. If you're looking for love and sex in the style of romance novels, you don't want this. As a suspense mystery, it was pretty good."
3,Don't be fooled by the cover.,"This is not an action anime at all. There is way more romance then anything else. I was fooled, i thought it would be a cool anime but in the end it is just way too girly. I sold it back on amazon after i watched it."
2,Fans of the manga beware,"It's not a bad series. The artwork is a bit dated, but that's understandable. If you're a fan of the manga, you will be disappointed though. The second half of the series deviates hugely from the story in the manga, and the ending is completely different. If you haven't read the manga, then this could entertain you. Otherwise, I'd stay away from it."
1,This CD is pure ....,"Aside from I Feel Fine, this CD has nothing to offer. Its repedative as all hell. Has a sever lack of creativity, and the vocalist gets annoying really fast. That and the fact that absolutely discrase one of the all time great songs in the disater that is ""Its the end of the world as we know it."" Dont buy this CD just download ""I feel fine"" and dont waste any of your time or money by going out and buying this POS CD."
1,Another faux-punk band...,Another faux-punk band. One good song (I Feel Fine) and a weak cover of REM's `End of the World'. Great cartoon cover of a girl kicking a boy in the nuts.
4,Great Album,"this is an awesome cd, riddlin kids have definately made their mark in the punk world. this cd is incredible and even though their other cds (any day now and why are you buying this?) were good as well, this one was a major breakthrough for them. they have awesome sound and amazing talent, in other words THEY ROCK!!"
4,Tzight,"This was an all-around good cd. If you like good punk bands, then this CD is for you. It truly is ""ferociously melodic"" as it says on the sticker on the CD. Another good thing about it is that it isn't your normal 11 or 12 track punk CD that is like 35 minutes long, this one has 15 tracks and 47 minutes. The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because it mostly sounds relatively the same, but that is also a good thing."
2,Waste your 45 minutes on something else,"I bought this cd for [$$] at [local store]and I'm glad that's all I paid. Other than ""I feel fine"" all the other songs have the same sound, tempo and feeling. The singer is awful and the melodies aren't the least bit catchy. With so many pop-punk bands these days, there are plenty that are doing thier own thing. There are plenty that aren't, but manage to put together a disc that's worth listening to. This cd does not fit either category. Please spend your money on another band that will offer you a rewarding listening experience because if you buy the cd and listen to it, you won't remember a single chorus after 10 minutes. Not good."
4,"Nothing spectacular, but catchy","It seems that most bands labeled as being part of the ""pop-punk"" genre get dismissed as a bland blink-182 wannabe. Truth is, there are some bands out there, pop-punk or not, who deserve recognition. Riddlin Kids is one such band. I first heard of Riddlin Kids in my school parking lot. A friend of mine with similar music tastes wanted me to listen to them. From that moment on, I knew I'd stumbled on something good. A few days later, I bought the CD. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the songs are not only catchy, but also contain surprisingly deep lyrics. Although there's not a whole lot of variety in the songs, all are worth listening to and don't drag the quality of the album down at all. Faithful, I Feel Fine, Nowhere to Run, and Here We Go Again are the best songs, but there are no subpar tracks. Well worth the money."
5,Great CD From a new band,"This cd is awesome! It from a great new punk band... The Riddlin Kids. They have a great sound that is completely addictive. I suggest you buy yourself a copy, and when they are under ten bucks you might as well buy a copy for all of your family members while you are at it. You won't regret it, I promise."
4,Great over-all workout,"I have been working out with Firm VIDEOs for 20 years (specifically, Firm Workout with Weights-Vol 4. and Firm Crosstrainer-Cardio), and was hesitant to try a new one. The Ultimate Fat Burning Workout is a good combination of both cardio and weight workouts. Although the cardio could have been tougher, this DVD offers a great overall total body workout in a reasonable period of time. (40 min.) Alison is an excellent instructor and very easy to follow. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a comprehensive workout in under one hour."
3,Not Her Best,"I purchased this video based off the strength of Alison's Bootcamp workout. I was not as impressed with this session. It was a little boring, especially the warm up, which was the usual Firm fare. She seems nervous and disconnected from what's going on as she gives instructions and cues.She really doesn't have a engaging personality. So if that is a big deciding factor then this video may not be for you. Also,her kickboxing form is not correct, and she gives no safety cues. So be wary!"
1,Worse workout I've tried,"I bought this DVD a couple of months ago I tried doing the work-out, but it's really fast paced and not easy to keep up with, not to mention boring I seriously think this is one of the worse workout DVD's I have bought. I suggest people not to waste their money!!!!"
2,Boring and Repetitive,"You better watch out or you might fall asleep during this workout....it is soooooo boring....the moves repeat and repeat and repeat. I felt that I got hardly any calorie burn. I was yawning all the way through this really! I will say that is a good conditioning workout, which means that it's good for a low-impact day or one of those days when you need to work out but simply don't feel like it (we've all been there, haven't we??)!"
5,Does exactly what it should do,"This workout is amazing. My boyfriend uses P90x and I have tried several of those dvds and this workout makes me sweat much more than most of the P90x dvds. There are moderate-fast dance moves then it slows down, which is when you really start to sweat. I get bored during the slower-moderate parts so I just put on the tv to keep my mind off of being bored. This dvd does EXACTLY what it should do; gets your heart rate up, gets your body sweating, and you really will notice a difference after 7-10 workouts."
5,Good starting point for those new to The Firm,"This was the first Firm DVD I bought and what helped me love this line of workouts. Granted, it's not as tough as some of the other pink Firms. But, it's a good intermediate workout and great to recommend to those new to the Firm. What I love about this DVD is the music really gets you going and the steps follow along with the rhythm and beat. I also love the fact that after using this DVD for a short amount of time I noticed a visible change in my body. I lost weight and firmed up just like I wanted and I can say that for all of the pink Firm DVDs I have. I even had friends and family ask what I was doing to look so good and are now working out to Alison and the gang too!"
4,"I love kickboxing, but...","I get my heart rate up in the video (445 calories in 45 minutes), but some of it is too slow. It would be more beneficial to me if more of it was upbeat. I LOVE kickboxing, which is why I chose 4 stars, but I would like it to be a bit more challenging..."
2,Just ok...not thrilled!,I love the Firm fitness video's and am an advanced exerciser. This FIRM video did not do it for me. It appears they are just trying to make the moves more original but it's not very effective from perspective. It gets boring after a while and the moves just get confusing after a while and I lose interest as I'm trying to get a workout. I just want a good workout...it doesn't have to be this complicated.
2,Not for the uncoordinated,"I picked up this DVD looking for something new to add to my weekly workouts. As soon as I started this workout, I felt like I was always 3 steps behind! My major complaint is that there is absolutely not enough time to get down the moves. During the second cardio segment, when she was ""sashay-ing"" around, I must have looked like I was having a seizure trying to keep up with that little blonde. I admit, I gave up about 25 minutes into the video and did another workout. It just seems to me that if you're going to try a workout like this, failure for those who can't pick up the moves right off the bat shouldn't be a consequence. The weight training segments I did like, but overall this workout is not for those as uncoordinated as myself. For all of us who like having time to learn the moves before doing them, I would suggest tryLeslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk."
3,Great workout!,"I really like this workout, the combos with the weights and the cardio and kickboxing are great! I do wish that they did a little more stretching in the beginning instead of jumping right into it."
4,A good at home workout,"Once you complete this DVD you definitely feel exercised, it's a great workout. It is quite easy to follow once you have done it a couple of times. The girl is not annoying (the women behind her are quite) she is serious and likeable. She goes a little too fast for my taste explaining the exercises. The first couple of times I had a really hard time following and once you are lost catching up is tough. I am not a workout addict and this dvd is perfect for people that just want a quick at home workout. It's not complicated either, the moves are not hard but the workout itself is tough. Overall i like it."
4,Good cardio,"Allison is great in this Firm video. The workout is nice and through. The only complaint I have about this workout, is that the repetitions are too repeated, and some cardio segments tend to drag on a little too long. So I felt some boredom in this workout. I eventually traded it, but its good for those who want a shorter, light cardio workout. Grade B"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Not worthy of The Firm name, this workout was repetitive, boring and doesn't belong in a Firm lineup. If you're a true Firm believer and LOVE the originals, DON'T waste your time with this one, it will only disappoint."
1,Not for over 50,"This workout is VERY difficult to follow and keep up with, especially for the over 50 ladies. Try Leslie Sansone (LOVE the 3 mile walk with weights and the 2 mile over forty workout). This Firm workout is not worth the money if you are not ready for a fast-paced, young crowd dvd."
5,"If I can do it, you can do it!","I bought this dvd on a dare. What's a 53 year old woman doing with a workout like this? Well, it is a great workout, lots of sweat, lots of intensity, but easy to follow. I just did it this morning and feel great."
4,Good For Beginner to Intermediate Level,"This video is a solid workout for beginner to intermediate level exercisers. If you are advanced, it will be a good choice for light days. No equipment required except for a pair of handweights, which are optional. The workout alternates moderate cardio segments (i.e. kickboxing, aerobic dance, etc.) and toning segmeents (i.e. various combinations of lunges/squats coupled with a bicep curl/lateral raise, etc.). You can make the toning segments more intense by using heavier weights. The workout ends with some ab work and about 16 or so straight-legged push-ups (sorry, I don't remember exactly how many, but I could do them all military style, so that tells me it could NOT have been more than 24 since that is my limit!).Overall, a solid and fun workout - 4 stars. I will probably purchase the FIRM Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn DVD next."
4,Healthy Living,Very good workout DVD .. I am a firm believer.. I own maybe twelve or more Firm tapes... It works if one is consistent.. I did this one today..My body tells me that it is working.. trying to find some of the older ones on DVD.
5,Superb 5th of Sibelius,Alot of people just don't understand how great Herbert K really was...Sibelius himself said he was the only conductor who fully understood his music! Add to that the intensity of tone and wonderful focused sound of the Berlin Phil and you have a group that seemed designed to perform Sibelius..The Valse Triste of Sibelius has never been played better by anyone..only Beecham is the competitor in this field...Kamu is super in the Second and generates alot of electricity...he is a very underrated musician today..Check Kamu out with Berwald on Naxos.
1,Absolutely Awful,"I think this toy is complete garbage. It is essentially a cardboard box with a plastic front. The cardboard is so flimsy. The box it shipped in was actually thicker. This toy is also really small so none of my daughter's other dress up clothes would fit inside. Because it is cardboard with plastic doors, it tips over very easily. Assembly was a little difficult because I was afraid of damaging the cardboard. I also had to reinforce the seams with clear packing tape as there were big gaps after assembly. This is a really cute idea but poorly executed. I don't see this toy lasting long because of it's quality, or lack thereof."
4,Great synthpop,"If you're a fan of Synthpop, this compilation rocks. The ""Tender Lies"" single from Freezepop is esp. boppy."
3,Tuneful and song-driven,"This is a fairly good compilation with quite a few songs to sing along with in your car. My only reservation is that the artists here are trying to recapture the ""New Romantic"" feel of 1980s bands such as Depeche Mode and Spandau Balley without creating anything new. It's pleasant enough."
3,"Good , not great",This and the rest of the collection is good but not great. Tony Rice ( who tragically lost his voice and will probably never sing again) does a great job on the first song. The rest of the album and series is good. The main problem is sadly the quality of the recording studio. It's not terrible like the recordings back in the 1930's (but we still listen to them because they are classics) but if you buy a more newer recording like Tiny Rice's bluegrass guitar album ( an amazing album) or even a live album (Skaggs at Charleston Hall or Rhonda Vincent Live) you can hear immediately that the recording equipment is much better today than in the 90's and 80's. I listened to this a few times but it didn't get the play that the newer albums with better recording equipment got. (PS if you want some GREAT albums try the ones I mentionned above!)
1,42 inch plasma samsung tv caught on fire,"We purchased our tv in Dec 2006 for $1699 plus tax. In July 2012, our 5 1/2 year old tv caught on fire. When the technician came out to look at it- he told me that they no longer coat the part that caught on fire with plastic for this reason. Samsung apologized for our tv catching on fire and was glad that noone was hurt, but that was the extent of their compensation for our tv catching on fire. The tv had a 5 year warranty and it was just out of warranty. I think it is horrific that they knew there was a problem, but did nothing to recall the tvs that were out there. It is extremely scarey to have your tv catch on fire and I am extremely disappointed in the way they handled it. We dealt with their ECR, which is the executive customer relations. We will never buy another samsumg product in our household."
1,SAMSUNG TVS DONT LAST,TV DIDNT LAST 2 YEARS .GREAT PICTURE FOR 23 MONTHS. IT COSTS AS MUCH TO FIX AS IT DOES TO BUY ANOTHER. I WONT BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG!!!
2,Awful TV,For my opinion its a tv with normal capabilitys is just big... when you are playing with gaming console with the HDMI cable it sometimes get blue a few parts of the SCREEN so is annoying for the sight... and ITS NOT 1080P resolution
2,Almost a great TV,"Bought this TV and loved it at first. About 3 months after purchase It developed a hum in the audio on the component connections. Called Samsung and they sent someone out who took the TV away and repaired it. Came back and had it now had a hum on the output side (going to the receiver) and 4 months later it also developed a problem with the screen (blue spot on the bottom left hand side). Called Samsung again. They sent out yet another (non Samsung Authorized repair center). They've had the TV now for over 15 days and no update from them. My advice to you is don't count on Samsung repair. They are worthless. Also, it should be known that this TV does not support variable output on the sound so you'll always have to adjust at the receiver (just a note). If the TV worked correctly, I'd probably give it a better review. It is nice, but if you have problems at all, you'll be in trouble. Buyer beware!!! Samsung will not take care of you if you have problems!!!!"
5,Samsung HP-S4253 is a Winner! Breathtaking HD Picture Quality!,"When I ordered this Samsung HDTV, I had no idea what to expect simply because I had never seen a true HD picture. Boy was I blown away when I turned on the Yankee game and saw the pores on the players' faces and each blade of grass. The set is beautiful and the inputs are numerous. I don't know why Cnet and Consumer Reports didn't like this set very much but I am here to tell you that this set is amazing! The only thing is: Be careful with burn-in. Don't watch it a lot with black bars on the left and right. If you get this plasma, make sure you have HD programming because it is as good as any HD picture out there!"
5,Great plasma TV,"I purchased this TV for my wife and myself back in April. I recently purchased one for my son for his birthday. Obviously, I am very happy with it. The TV has great High Def images. My son periodically calls me to thank me for it. He and his wife love it. He is also a video game fan and says that his XBOX 360 games look great on it.It's a terrific TV and the price is right. We bought both of the TV's from Amazon - free shipping, no taxes...it's a can't miss deal!"
3,Be careful of dead pixels,"Our HP-S4253 was bought last Thanksgiving. It was a great plasma TV at the beginning, marvelous HD resolution, vivid color and many useful jacks on the back.However, recently a bright red dot appeared in the center of the screen. This dot is most eye-catching when the background is dark.I called the service center of Samsung and was told that only one dead pixel was not a service issue. Their policy was a seven-dots rule. If you have fewer than seven bright, sometimes flashing red dots on your plasma screen, sorry, that's your own problem.Later I found that every TV manufacturer has its own ""pixel policy"" to deal with complaints about such dots.Customers at a store can open the box and check the TV on spot. But if you buy a LCD or plasma TV online like I did, you are taking a chance."
2,Caution above 5500ft,"Both seller (Tiger Direct) and Amazon fail to disclose in the tech summary that these Plasma's have major issue's at altitudes above 5500 feet! Final tally after returning the item:Shipping to me, $171.50Shipping back to Tiger Direct, $251.94Plus I purchased a Samsung 1000watt home theater system that worked for twenty five minutes before it quit, so back in the box for another shipping charge of $21.86. LOL $400.00 and change for nothing! If you read this do yourself a favor and buy locally! It's nice to save a few bucks when it all goes good! But be prepared to loose big if the items are defective! At least locally you can return it with no out of pocket expence.Also Amazon has a sweet rep of being the hardest company to contact via voice, making things even more complicated.. I'll just chalk it up to lessons well learned, and hope I save a few of you the experiance.."
3,Beware of the Buzz,"When my TV arrived, I had the delivery guy wait while I plugged it in. When I did so, I was able to hear an audible buzzing coming from the unit, which is not normal according to all the electronics message boards that I did my research on. I then refused delivery and shipped it back to Amazon and will try ordering again, but did not want to take a chance with Amazon's strict policy about not exchanging TVs over 27 inches. It looked great for the few minutes it was at my place and I think it will be a great TV if I am able to get one that does not buzz."
4,Good deal - great picture - remote needs a better design - speakers are mediocre,"I've had this TV for over 3 months now. No question the picture is extra crisp in HD (though I can't really compare it to but a 20+ year old Sony 27"" near flat screen trinitron). The menu controls are pretty well laid out. The component plugins in the back and sides were a little difficult to figure out, but trial and error eventually saw me through. The (universal - nice!) remote is big and the only thing that bothers me so far is that to change the channel, the enter button is 3-4 inches below the number buttons, or you can just wait until 1 or 2 seconds later as it accepts your button presses. The speakers pretty much tops out at the 50% zone. If you have a livingroom with 10 people who are talking, your TV will lose out to your guests' volume. Also on a side note, the lettering on the bezel was scuffed a good bit when I received it, though has nothing to do with performance of the TV."
2,Burn in,This product was purchased 10 months after comparison shopping and on line reviews. The picture was great until this weekend when I noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non-hd broadcasts. Samsung's tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty. The commercial hype by Samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help. Samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real % of their sets which experience the problem. My friends have Panasonics which have never had the problem even after 3 years usage.
3,Okay for the price.,"I did a lot of research and I picked this TV for the good value. I was truely happy with this set for the first few months until the blue dots started showing up. The random blue dots only show up when I'm stretching a standard definition show and they only show in the top left part of the screen. It also seems to be related to the audio as I can see the beautiful ""northern lights"" change with the audio. If you only watch Hi-def then I would still recommend this screen. If you feel lucky or like a random 'northern lights' experience then I still recommend this screen. :-)"
3,help me.,My mom bought this and it's our first plasma. Can anybody tell me why when I change channels there are flickering static like lines in the center? It lasts for atleast 1 second.
1,Disappointing Support,"I got this TV after reading the positive reviews here, and at first I was pretty happy with it. It looked nice whether on or off. However, it developped a super bright blinking red pixel in the center of the screen after about 3 weeks of use, which is impossible to ignore and has completely ruined my TV watching experience.I've tried reaching Samsung support but they always seem to be experiencing ""very high call volumes"". I was finally able to get through, but they refused to do anything about it until at least 10 pixels are dead, ""like the warranty says"". Sure, it says so, but what would an aribtrary number like that mean in terms of user experience? I would rather throw the TV away than having to endure another blinking red pixel. What this says is that Samsung doesn't care about its customers."
1,Gorgeous looking Plasma/Worthless customer service,"I have had this Plasma for a month now and love the picture. The connections are plentiful and the set itself is nice looking as well. Guess what though I am one of the lucky ones who has a BUZZER. I know you all wish you had one too. Well if you do have a BUZZER then I am sorry. Samsung's customer service is worthless they are deplorable. This plasma would get 5 stars even with the loud BUZZING sound if Samsung's customer service would be helpful to their customers. As of right now I am suppose to get a replacement from Samsung, but no one their will tell me when. I wont get into the whole story, but bottom line their are many BUZZING 4253 and 5053 Samsung plasmas out there and no one at Samsung will admit to it, nor will they help you in a timely manner!!! Stay clear from this plasma and look else where!"
4,great value,"After much searching and reviewing I decided to purchase the Samsung HP-S4253. It had all of the requirements I was looking for, great price and great picture quality. Very easy to set up and delivered in record time. I had a small problem with the TV recognizing the HDMI input from my cable box but that was the cable company's fault. Samsung sent a service person out right away and they were able to get around this flaw so that I could take advantage of the superior quality picture from the HDMI. I highly recommend this TV and Samsung."
5,Great Plasma HDTV,No problems with this set at all. It offered all the connections I wanted and the picture is fantasic. All my friends that have a plasma tv have commented that this set is as good or better than the ones they have.
5,"Great price, great picture, great sound.","I decided on this the Samsung plasma after a month of research and paid $1369 (no shipping/no tax) on Amazon. The TV arrived 1 week early and I am 100% satisfied so far. I was a little concerned about the buzzing noise before buying, but I DO NOT hear this buzzing noise people keep talking about. It sounds fine, but I do plan to hook up surround sound to enhance the experience.Overall, this TV looks sleek, picture is outstanding, sound is fine, and price is just right. GREAT VALUE and I would buy it again."
4,"Great picture, great value for the money.","Samsung, for the money, probably has the best plasma on the market. Picture is great, television has great sound out of the box. Plenty of inputs and features. Only issue, and this is the same for most lower end plasmas, is a buzzing noise you will notice when you have the sound at low levels. I have mine on a surround, so it not as noticable. This buzz is prominent when the picture is calling for a lot of white or brightness on the screen. Shipper was first rate, not a complaint with delivery or customer service."
4,Satisfied Customer,At the time of purchase 1080I sets are about $1200 cheaper than the new 1080P. At the time of this review I have had this unit for 1.5 months and have had no problems yet. This is my first plasma and first digital television. I am very impressed with the picture. The color is amazing. I have noticed some pixilization during live action but for the most part not bad. I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a plasma set as long as stations are not sending 1080P signals and the price difference is so great to upgrade to a 1080P set.
5,Best TV for the Price,"Just got this little puppy and let me tell you, the picture is totally outstanding. And, it's like the tv was built for gaming... I plugged in my XBOX 360 and it was a different experience gaming.Some people are claiming to have problems with the tv's audio, but in this day and age, if you're going ahead and buying a 42"" plasma tv for your home theater, you should also be investing in a great surround sound system. This will eliminate any question marks on sound (though my tv has not shown any problems with its built in SS)."
2,Originals are her forte,"I'm a fan of Kate Campbell and have most of her records. In my opinion, doing covers of well known hit songs is best left to those with incredible singing voices - M. McBride, Carrie Underwood, etc. I think Kate Campbell's greatness comes from her songwriting, not the singing. Plus, she doesn't bring anything stylistically to the songs to make these recordings special. The title song is an original and is very good."
4,Epicus Doomicus Metallicus,Asva = a cool wet mellow dark cave where a droning guitar and percussion feed the dark poetry to the ears of the musical bender. A sludgy mess that mixes the haunting vocals of a lingering ghost to it Gothic embryo.
1,cheap radio recording...and no libretto!,"This is not a cheap set to get, so imagen my surprise when I put in the first CD and it sounds is like one of those old Victrola recordings. Not what I was expecting in this day and age...and there was no libretto with this, with english translations."
3,It's OK,"I was kind of dissapointed with this one, but I'll admit I still listen to a few tracks from it now and then. It does come with a pretty cool DVD of a set at Amnesia, but it's only a couple of 20 minute clips. I still enjoy watching it, though. There just aren't as many tracks on this album as I would have liked, and they were a little too mainstream. I just expected something more like the Sound of the Third Season with Richie Hawtin, and it just wasn't that."
5,Fantastic read for divers and non-divers alike!!!,"Great book and easy read, this book is full of facts but not to the point of losing the high drama and power of the subject matter. Also the actual photos help tell the story which adds to the chilling effect of the true life tragedies told. Great book. Along with ""The Last Dive"", these two books are the best wreck-diving books on the market today."
3,"Interesting reading, but technically weak","I found Deep Descent to be good reading, albeit weaker technically than it should have been. The author states he has many years of experience, but the reality is, he has one year of experience, many times. He was NOT a very advanced diver, rather a diver with novice experiences, over many years. One picture in the book has a caption that explains we are looking at the data on a dive computer. Actually, it's not a computer, but a bottom timer. Apparently a minor distinction, but not to a true technical diver. Chowdhury's book is far better technically, in addition to being great reading. I can recommend Deep Descent, but I can't rave about it. Read it, but don't expect to be glued to it like you were to The Last Dive."
4,"""The mind is supreme and the mind is falliable...""","This book is most definitely required reading for divers at any level, but especially those who dive wrecks. It's been said that the Andrea Doria is the Mt. Everest for divers in terms of sheer difficulty and, based on the narratives in this book, I'm inclined to agree."
5,"Suspense, danger, and all that goes with it!!","This book, takes you from this earth, and places you in another world. Men and women, who take you on a journey, to a place only a few people dare. I daringly dove to 300 feet, beneath the surface of the ocean, in the comfort of my living room chair. Great book!!"
5,"McMurray ""Descent"" Series","I actually purchased this book after I read McMurray's book on wreck diving the ""Empress Of Ireland."" I couldn't put that down - what a great book. I'm not a diver, but the reference to the ""Empress of Ireland"" drew me to it as Clive Cussler's ""Night Probe"" kicked off with her sinking. I hadn't realized the ""Empress"" was more deadly than the ""Titanic"" and, unlike the latter, the ""Empress"" went down in a mere 14 minutes - REAL bummer! Fascinating reading with the human and political twists that make it more than just an adventure tale; diving such as this puts an entirely different face on what some folks consider a safe sport. Highly recommended, as well as McMurray's other opus, ""Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland."""
2,Deep Descent: Could've been much better,"I got so confused trying to cope with the subject of this book. I had to do several read backs to understand the chapters because the author jumps from one story to another. I think this book was poorly written and I would not recommend it to those looking for a good read on the Andrea Doria dives. I guess it's okay for ""light reading""."
2,"interesting, but....","An interesting tale, but the writing is nothing compared to that of Bernie chowdhury's book, ""The Last Dive"", which without many pictures, had much cleared descriptions. A good book for a diver who just wants to pass the time between dives."
5,DEEP DESCENT,"I have read all of Gary Gentiles books and enjoyed them all. This book written by McMurray is just as great. Once you start reading it, you cant ever just put the book down. This book should be read by anyone who dives. A+ BOOK.Mike BullardLewes, De."
3,A good introduction to its subject,"I was interested in reading this book after I saw a documentary about the way automobile companies helped put an end to the streetcars which were once common in American cities--even in Los Angeles.What I found here was both fascinating and disturbing; the book really had an impact on the way I look at and think about the man-made environment around me.I have since gone on to read more about this subject; I would have to say that although this book is a good introduction to this topic, Kunstler's Geography of Nowhere is both more comprehensive and more compelling. Kay's book really seems to lose its focus somewhat when it offers suggestions for change, a few of which seem reasonable, but most of which seem unlikely to ever win the support of the majority of the public."
2,A Muddled Mess,"Let me first say that I completely agree with Kay's main point: Our car culture has huge costs, costs which are way out of whack with their benefits.Having said that, this book fails to convince the skeptic, which ought to be her intended audience. It's a long series of disjointed arguments and statistics and bizarre examples of planning mistakes carefully picked from history with 20/20 hindsight. Far from its other ""Nation"" namesakes (Suburban Nation, for example, seriously changed my outlook on how we build cities), it fails to follow some narrow trends or examples, and instead in every chapter tells the same story over and over. This book has great potential, but it feels like the sentences got all mixed up in the publisher's word processor so that no coherent story is told.If you're a fanatic, it's worth a read, but the skeptic will walk away confused and will not be inclined to buy the downtown row house Kay might admire."
5,"A worthy thesis, well presented","I've noticed how much design caters to car traffic for some time now. Not only are bus systems left behind in plans, but it is also difficult to walk anywhere these days. I'm not crazy about her ideas like raising gas prices, or anything that raises the misery factor for low income people struggling to keep their jalopy running (like harsh smog test requirements) but the idea of making alternative transportation easier and more attractive is good.There could have been a little more attention to using the already in place car infrastructure for alternative fuel vehicles. But that doesn't take away from the basic idea behind the book."
1,Nothing new to make this worthwile.,"This book is very thorough about describing how cars became ingrained in our lives, but it didn't offer much insight. I'm guessing most people who read this book have some notion of how urban sprawl leads to car dependency and lack of inner-city. This book does little more than re-state that.Additional weak points:- No presence of counter argument.- Repetitive- Not enough attention was payed to the 'taking it back' portion of the title. Roughly 4/5 of the book were taking over America, 1/5 taking it back. No new ideas were presented in the 'taking it back' section."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"This is a horrible excuse for a piece of literature. Although her subject matter is occasionally rational, the repetition and horrible alliteration she uses is painful. What should have been written in 3 concise chapters drags on for 18 mind-numbing ones. I reccommend that no one reads this book as it was a waste of a quite a bit of my time, although I do commend her on her efforts to enlight the world on the ever-present environmental problems that we face on a daily basis."
3,Interesting facts badly presented.,"The book gives factual accounts of San Francisco'sand many other cities efforts to come to grips with the automobile. Unfortunately the author tosses all the city sagas together into one big salad. In the reviewers opinion, it would have been better to begin with some particular cities in detail, working from the PARTICULAR TO THE GENERAL.Conclusion: Interesting facts; bad organization.Review by:Professor George PurdyUniversity of Cincinnati.george.purdy@uc.edu"
3,"Nice history, lacks conclusions","Most of the other reviews say a lot about toe book, so I won't repeat. Being 'one of those radicals' :) who thinks the car has gotten us into trouble I have read a lot on the subject together. I found Kay's book to be a great 'intro' or 'history of how we got here'. I foudn most of the facts a repeat of other texts or History channel shows. The biggest problem is the lact of a good conclusion - you read through the text and then 'well, what can I do?', only to be left high and dry. Again, a nice history and overview. If you want to do some serious reading, you're best off going to her bibliography reading some of her source material (I found I had read lots of them alredy! ;-) Get this to introduce yourself or your friends to the topic, but given a choice read ""geography of nowhere"" or ""edge city"" for more content."
3,Interesting but repetitive,"I found the premise of this book interesting. Ms. Kay clearly feels passionate about the subject. However, the book was not rooted in well researched data. It was also somewhat repetitive- she said the same thing several times throughout the book! I felt the best section was about the history of the automobile, which is in the middle of the boo"
4,Loss of Economic Competitiveness,"No wonder our American jobs are being outsourced oversees - we demand more money from our employers so that we can drive farther from our home to work and spend, spend, spend on our cars to do this. We think buying a cheaper house in the 'sububs' saves money, but we spend more money on our cars and gas bills in the long term than we initially bargained for. Living closer to where we work maybe the solution - or telecommuiting (whatever happened to that idea?) but that's not really the point of the book, just an unstated theme throughout. I thought I could live in the county and work from home, but now I spend $500 a month on driving into the city and wasting precious time trapped in a car. Live and Learn - and think about reading this book (or at least the reviews...)"
3,Hit and Miss,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. The first chapter is awesome. The last section (the last six chapters) is also very good. However, the author seems to ramble on in the middle of the book, concerned more by her ability to impress her audience with a very extensive vocabulary than conveying the compelling and condemning facts against the car. Also, there are several glaring grammatical/spelling errors in the book. The one that comes most readily to mind is where she misspelled Gresham, OR, but there were others too."
4,Hard to find a printing caluclator,"I have been looking for an inexpensive printing calculator, and finally found it in the Sharp that I purchased. Great little machine for the money. Happy with performance and overall purchase."
5,Sharp Printing,"Haven't used this calculator yet, but it looks like very good quality. It came with a teeny roll of adding machine tape. Although that shouldn't keep anyone from buying this machine."
5,i want to hear more,not enough of a sample but a great voice and i think a new sound cant wait to hear more of NEW HAMPSHIRE GOOD LUCK TO REAL COOL TRADERS.
3,Has some errors,"Yes, it's a great bargain. BUT, be careful - the Symphonie Fantstique portion of this score is taken from the early Breitkopf plates and is full of errors!"
3,Why are they so short?!,"This is one of the better Millennium Collections, but I can't help but wonder why they don't take advantage of the fact that a cmpact disc holds 80 minutes of music.But having said that, this 11-track compilation does manage to include many of early British blues-rock outfit Free's best songs, from the radio staple ""All Right Now"" and a live version of ""Mr Big"" to the majestic ""Come Together In The Morning"" and the band's last hit ""Wishing Well"".There's a lot of great songs missing, however, and the double-disc anthology ""Molten Gold"" remains the best Free retrospective by far.3 1/4 stars."
2,Fascinating material in dry dry boring format.,I recieved this book as a christmas present from my parents in 1963. I am wondering if anyone ever managed to read this book.
3,Poorly Explained,This is the result of a maths guy giving philosophical scientific explanations .I found many the diagrams very poorly designed : novelty doesn't replace clarity . The many of the explanations were also fuzzy . The book is presented in large print and for a short book it would be more worthy of a chapter in a more illuminating overview . I sure someone with a clearer mind could bring the ideas to light.
1,The worst white rapper ever.,The worst white rapper ever. He should change his name to hillbilly jim. He should be a farmer not a rapper.its give a 0 out of 5.
4,Buy This Album!,"Bubba comes back spitting the sweet slow southern ryhmes that he hit us with on the last album. That right there is enough reason to buy the album. However, the beats on this ablum just can't go unmentioned. Wonderfully produced and just plain insane! There are so many styles used throughout this cd that it would take too long to list, but just know they're all done magnificently. Buy the album and see for yourself!!"
4,Deliverance delivers!,"Bubba's back with a second serving for all you country crazed fans, and it does NOT dissapoint in the least. With offerings like ""Deliverance"" on which he lets all naysyers know ""We Shall have deliverance"", the country infused ""Comin Round"" where bubba continues to tell his country tales laced by the crazy sounds of timbaland. (this is a crazy track!), ""She Tried"" is bubba's first love song, very sincere, with a country sung hook, but if you ain't the lovin' type then let your ears bounce to ""take a load off"", this track will surely get you in the mood to take a load off. Some still believe bubba to be a gimmick, but This album proves otherwise. If you don't have this album go get it. You are missing out on a timeless classic."
4,So damn Under-rated,Not much to say but the following:1. Bubba sparks tears it up- gifted emcee- not a one hit wonder.2. Timbaland has to be one of the best producers ever.buy this album.
5,Its a sad thing,"Its sad to see that THIS white rapper just can't make it to the financial status of other pathetic rappers such as Lil' Jon, Master P, all those No Limit morons.......What deliverance offers is an incredibly produced album by Timbaland(one of the greatest producers in the business)and a unique style that has never been heard before, unlike the repetitious beats that you hear from some of those terribly overrated rappers out there these days.................. I'm not from the south, but this album is fantastic! I hated Bubba Sparxxx albums before this one came out, i couldnt stand his music, but then i heard this album, and i was fascinated at how different it was compared to everyone else,,,, he is what the rap industry needs, a pioneer to take the industry to a new level, to ""1 up"" the next guy........ i think he did this, but however its sad that most Rap fans will never get a chance to listen to this great album.................. its a sad thing"
4,Bubba DELIVERs the goods!!!!,"This is the album that the potential he showed on the first album promised. Whereas on his debut, sometimes Bubba's delivered was abit lacklustre in places, he defiantly glides across every track with the ease+confidence of a seasoned mc. His laid back rhyme style sounds absolutely sublime over Timbaland's funky soundscapes. With Timbaland handling virtually all the production bar 2 or 3 tracks,(courtesy of Organised Noize) the album bumps along brilliantly from start to finish. From the head nodding ""jimmy mathis"", ""comin' round"", ""take a load off"", ""like it or not"" and ""disappear"" to the mellow soulful tracks like ""she tried"", ""nowhere"" and ""hootnanny"" to the anthemic ""deliverence"" its an absolute triumph. The real gems here are Bubba's honest+sparkling flow and Timbaland's best work for ages both on show. Just awesome!!"
5,crunk cracka crunk...,timbo comes correct.bubba comes correct.hottest rap city out in a minute... word.
3,Dark Days....,"""Deliverance"" disappointed me and generally misled the high expectation ""Dark Days, Brigh Nights"" had set. The whole album has too much of a country sound to it, that stops to be amusing and becomes annoying halfway through. The choruses are despairingly long, and on the most part analogous. The title track for example 70% chorus, 20% rap and 10% instrumental. The tracks provide little variety and really none of them surpasses Bubba's work on the previous album. The mood that ""Dark Days..."" created is no longer evident here. Bubba's rapping skills have not gone worse, of course, and some of the tracks are really jolly and original, but by large the album is serious downfall, in comparison to his debut."
4,"WOW, A HUGE SURPRISE!!!!","Great lyrics, great beats, what else do you need. Well you can find exactly this, in Bubba Sparxx's new CD Deliverance. Its at least, AT LEAST 10 times better than his first cd Dark Days, Bright Nights. Bubba has got this cd down pat. I dont think that he can get much better than this. It's a great cd and at a great price. Comparred to other CD's this is actually pretty cheap. I thought about it, before I bought it, and after hearing the song Deliverance, i made up my mind. If you think that song was great, just wait until you hear the others. A couple of my personal favorites are of course DELIVERANCE, and also tracks 5 & 8. Those are just my favorites, the rest are all as equally DOPE........THIS CD IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!"
4,Bubba is still a pimp,It wasn't as good as his first CD but the beats are sick and the vocals are crazy as ever. I wish that he got as much credit that he deserves because he is a great artist that isn't heard of much. Buy this and you won't be mad! And if you check out the Bubba Sparxxx offical site (BubbaSparxx.com) you can translate your words into how Bubba would say it... It's fun and something worth checkin out!
3,Bubba,"bubba sparxxx.. well, the only thing i guess realy is that if u liked his 1st album(dark days bright nights)u should have no problem liken his new one.. to me its prety much the same thing, couple songs that i could do w/out but for the mos part a pretty decent album. Deliverance has some good beats on it. Go for it and give it a shot."
4,Bubba the Spark.........,"It's a shame that this album fell under the commercial radar. This is a complete album from front to finish. Solid production with a southern feel from the eptiome of a true sothern rapper. Bubba's not just a white rapper, he's a right rapper. After a few listens to the this joint I was compelled to purchase a trailer home and get my moonshine on. It will be hard to improve on the intricate brilliance of this album, so hopefully he will equal his effort on his next joint, so that the hip-hop community will take full notice of his remarkable musical talent."
4,"new south represent, yall","Bubba brings his Southern hip hop talent once again on his 2nd cd entitled ""Deliverance"". I gotta say that this album will probably go unnoticed by the masses (""ugly"" is what people know from Bubba). That is a shame, b/c Bubba has tons o' talent up on the mic, and Timmy's beats are tight. A little bit out there, but still on point. I like the Southern-fried feel of this record; Bubba represents the new South 100%. If you liked the first record, or simply want to hear some fresh hip hop talent, pick up this cd today."
3,"Sometimes funny, pretty pages, and interesting.","I enjoyed the honesty of the book and how the author shared her life with her readers. Honesty is a quality not often found in authors, especially new ones. I'm eagerly awaiting Annie's next book, and interested in how Bill's chiropractic career is going."
1,The worst book I've read in a long time.,"Please, choose something else. This book is so terrible it makes meconsider being a writer. Everything about it is embarassingly cliche.She has a mother and sisters who she really loves, but GOSH, theysure bicker and drive her crazy! She has a boyfriend who she reallyloves, but GOSH, marriage is so scary! To make things worse, her sisters'names are Carol, Sharon, and (?), but she calls them ""Ca,"" ""Sha,"" and""Ga"" throughout the entire book. She also uses the word ""bust"" at least200 times, which is incredibly annoying. She also seems to think she isthe first person on earth to be politically liberal and have morals. I thinkthat I need to say no more after telling you that this is an actual sentencefrom the book: ""I rollerbladed around downtown, rocking to Annie Lennoxand U2 on my Walkman."" Please, the world is full of great literature.Find some, this isn't it!!"
4,FUN AND EASY READING,"If you want an easy book to read that will make you smile this is a pretty good book. I did get some help for my roses, and I really enjoyed this book a lot."
2,Mildly entertaining,"This is a little on the juvenile side. But does provide a few laughs. Don't buy it, borrow it."
3,Linda losing her grip...,"Hugely popular in it's day (I would imagine due to the sexy cover shots of la Ronstadt on rollerskates), this album isn't nearly as good as ""Simple Dreams"" from the year before (or, indeed, any of Linda's previous rock-oriented efforts). Chuck Berry's ""Back in the USA"" (which would have been a better title for the album) is mildly rocking yet never takes off--a live version w/Berry many years later is much preferable; ""All That You Dream"" and ""White Rythmn & Blues"" are decent but colorless entries; Elvis Costello's ""Allsion"" is another good idea that gets a dry run-through by Ronstadt (still, it's probably my favorite track, which gives you an idea of what's left). Too many styles were tried for, and the results are distinctly under-cooked."
5,Great CD!,I got this for my 10 month old daughter for when she plays independetly in her playpen so there would be something in the background. She absolutely loves it! She starts dancing the minute I turn it on. I have played it every day for her for 3 weeks straight and she still loves it. And I am still enjoying it!
1,Leave Silly Putty alone,"Thought neat idea for grandkids. 6 year old granddaugher sat down on ball she had made from silly putty to mash it flat. Made terrible mess, would not come off top nor couch. Had no idea damage it would do"
4,Good enough to use in my DVD recorder,2.4X is good enough for my DVD recorder.Got 23 perfect discs out of 25.
3,Blank DVD,"I bought this along with a pack of CDs and DVD+R because of the great deal I got. Realized that owning a portable HardDrive is far more convenient since what I was really looking for was HD space.Ended up buying a 250GB External HD for $80 on thanksgiving. It works for me since its much faster than burning CDs and really satisfies my HD needs. If you are looking for portability in addition to space, I would recommend you try a portable HardDrive (costs arnd $160) and very sleek, lighweight. Also no power cord required with portable ones since they are laptop poweredNo issues with the DVDs though. They work perfect so far .. touch wood"
5,They work for me...,"Not much to say here except that I haven't had any problems with these disks. They were free after rebate, so I figured I'd give them a try. They're very bland looking--no lettering or graphics--but that's not important to me anyway."
1,READ THIS,THIS GUN HERE SELLS FOR 127 DOLLARS. IF YOU BUY THE EXACT GUN ANYWHERE ELSE IT COSTS LESS THEN 80 DOLLARS. Sometimes on sale for 55-65 dollars. Look elsewhere for this product!!!!!!!
5,Enter into God's presence,"I love Hillsongs and this is another great CD. I especially like the Eagles Wings song. I had one and lost it, so I had to buy another."
2,Not the best seller.,I ordered 100 copies of this. I got 10 in two different shipments over a span of 1 month and had to cancel the remaining orders and look for a different vendor.The product was new as described but i'm not happy with the merchant.
1,Disregard for customers,"I've had the same Staywell cat door for 25 years, and it works satisfactorily.However, the magnetic keys are becoming a problem. They eventually wear out and now the company has stopped selling the pack of two keys (oddly they still seem to be available in the UK and Australia). Now they sell one key and a collar that I don't need for about what two keys used to cost.Having multiple cats, I need to consider whether the prospective future cost of keys justifies replacing the door with a different brand."
4,"Magnetic keys work great, with some side effects","The picture for this product should make it more clear that you're only purchasing the spare magnetic keys, not the flap itself. I had already purchased the flap (and my cat lost his collar), so I could tell from the price that the flap wasn't included.This product works great, and now only my cats can enter through the pet door! I previously owned a different type of electronic cat door, and the locking mechanism was so loud, it scared my cats! This new model is much quieter. Because the magnet used is a bit strong, occasionally my cats will return home with a nail, staple or other piece of metal attached to their collar, but that's rare, and the benefits far outweigh the negatives."
3,Not all cat doors are created equal,"I purchased this collar combo because I thought I could use it with my Cat Mate 4 way ""electromagnetic"" cat door. The magnets are WAY too strong for it. But alas, I can't find cat collars that are sans magnetic parts so I kept these for the collars only. Make sure you only get it for the petsafe brand cat doors."
2,"Great idea, not engineered properly","I like the idea, but the magnet on this is kinda strong. My cat had to shove his head right up to the plastic and downward to get through the door. Didn't seem to want to do it. Believe me, I tried. Ended up getting the Staywell infrared version, works much better. The tags on that unlock the door from a little farther away."
5,Lets my cats in and keeps other critters out,"The collar and magnet work great with the companion cat door. It lets our cats in while keeping other animals out, specifically a pesty raccoon. The collar is adjustable and the magnet is light weight and effective. It would be nice, however, if you could just buy the magnet and put it on your own cat collar; but, it works great and that's what mattered most."
3,Solid as rock,"If you liked Get Born, its near impossible not to like Shine On. Jet doesn't take to many risks on this cd and keeps if safe, sticking to their retro rock style. This album is a little softer than their debut, and the soft ones shine bright, Shine On and Kings Horses are brilliant. Overall Shine On is pretty solid, but it feels as though it's missing something, some sort of progression or evolution maybe? But then again it just wouldn't be Jet.Key tracks: Stand Up, Rip It Up, Holiday, Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, Kings Horses, Come On Come On, and Shine On"
2,Let down,"After listening to this album I put on ""Get Born."" The way ""Last Chance"" comes at you with the drums and guitar . . . well, if you don't like that then you don't like rock and roll. There are some other songs on Get Born that produce similar adrenaline rushes. ""Shine On"" produces nothing. ""Rip it Up"" rips up nothing. Hum the guitar riff from the song . . . times up. You can't because there isn't one that you can hum. ""Stand Up"" is ok - just. Two many slow (boring) songs on the record (three in a row at one point!) Is the band that lacking in common sense when it comes to album flow? The Oasis comparison is apt. It's not rocket science boys: get in the studio and rock! Riffs, drums, uncomplicated beats. Hoops and hollers. Rocking chorus. Get Born had lots of blues-based stuff. This album doesn't. Enough said."
4,Jet - 'Shine On' (Atlantic),"Review no. 59. Band's second effort - not quite as good as their first CD 'Get Born' but still very good. tracks that make this title a keeper are ""Holiday"", the in-your-face full-throttled rocker ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is"", ""Bring It on Back"" (has sort of a Beatles-like vibe), the ass-kicking ""That's All Lies"", ""Come On Come On"" and the well-played ""Skin And Bones"". NOT to be confused in any way whatsoever with the '70's glam band by the same name - Jet which featured two members of John's Children (a pre-T. Rex collective)."
4,Fine second effort from aussie rockers,"This album shows a more suble approach to songwriting and performance than their more straightforward first album. There are still plenty of marshall amps turned to 11 here, but the the ballads and midtempo numbers are where the band really shines. The much noted Beatles influence is not slavish imitation so much as carrying on the classic values of melodic songwriting. Jet have shown growth and have the potential to be a major band for years to come"
3,Shine On is okay but not great,A good 2nd attempt by Jet but definitely not as good as their first album. I was actually a little disappointed.
5,"Fresh, yet Retro .. as earlier, it's almost 1969 all over again","Jet. Sophomore entry with SHINE ON.Truly their own sound, yet you can hear the heavy essence and influence of some of the greatest Rock of all time in this. All of the tunes absolutely do hold weight on their own merit. Ballads as smooth as silk (SHINE ON, ELEANOR), but it's the rocking tunes (RIP IT UP, STAND UP, PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS) that really prop this one up.I absolutely love every single cut on this! I have been waiting for this for months and months and it's finally here. This is the album that will probably land Jet into R&R; Hall of Fame in about 10 years ... I predict this will be one of the classics of all time, holding up far better over time than GET BORN.You won't be disappointed."
3,not that bad,"1st, it doesn't have Paul Chapman on it. Chris George is a pretty good guitarist, but he ain't no Paul Chapman. The sound quality isn't that great, but the performances are pretty good actually. I also like the 2 old UFO covers at the end of the disc. Thumbs up for those. Paul Chapman tunes, go figure ..."
3,Item is not same as description.,The Item w/o the packaging is NOT the same as the description. The picture shows a shorter wheel lock while the description is the correct size (longer one.)
4,Great mystery,This is a very good book. Very exciting. It is rather violent but it is logical. I will continue the series.
4,Not his best,"I read all the (current 12) Joe Picket novels during the summer, and that must mean something.They vary somewhat in quality, they are not Nobel prize winners - but all very entertaining.This is not his best stuff. There is this recurring theme of eco-terrorism in this series that can feel a little bit far fetched."
2,Savage Run Over The Top and Disappointing,"I just finished reading Savage Run and was, on the whole, quite disappointed. First, it was even more violent than Open Season, a book that I DID like for the most part. Second, it had only one sympathetic character other than Joe Pickett. I really hated the ending and found it totally unnecessary after all the trials and tribulations the characters had gone through to get to that point.I also felt the character of Pickett was overly thorny and obtuse. His aw shucks boyish charm didn't make up for it.All in all, it had some good parts, but it wasn't worth the time."
3,one of the best in the series,I have read many in the series tho not in order and generally enjoy them. I have concluded that I like the earlier ones better; I get tired of some of the same old characters--particularly Romanowski and the mother-in-law. 3 1/2 stars is about right. I like the series by Steven Havill & Michael McGarrity better.
5,More than just a your basic chase.,Lots of interesting facts go into story of eco-terrorists vs the barons. Box doesn't go for the standard profanity and gore. Somehow a competent professional killer is scarier than the sicko-sexuals which have been done to death. Would add that g-ratedness and the good character of game warden Joe Pickett makes it recommendable for young readers.
4,Great fun - Joe Pickett is a real character,"Solid writing style, really great characters who you empathize with, well drawn plot. C.J. Box has a unique series going here and I hope he can maintain the quality over time."
4,A shade less believable than OPEN SEASON,"Just a shade. It's still a must read if you enjoyed the first book, or as in my case the most recent one, NOWHERE TO RUN.Again, there is the balanced view of environmentalism. The one qualm I have on the book is that the murderous attempts are rather extreme for professional hit men. On the other hand, this is a book that once started is difficult to put down. The characterization is superb, and there is one character who I rather hope to meet again as I progress in my endeavor to read the rest of the series within three weeks."
3,Get the BGO Release,"I have the BGO release of ""This Diamond Ring"" and ""A Session with..."" and it sounds spectacular... In my opinion BGO did their homework and remastered these two hard to find CD's perfectly! I had the original album when it was first released (first generation Beatles, Gary Lewis, Monkees, Beach Boys, etc. fan) and I KNOW how these babies should sound... THANKS BGO!!!"
4,A MUST FOR GARY LEWIS FANS,"FOR ALL G LEWIS FANS THIS CD CONTAINS HIS FIRST 2 ALBUMS AND IT IS HIM AT HIS VERY BEST ESPECIALLY ALBUM NUMBER 2 WITH GREAT SONGS WHICH EVEN TODAY HAVE A UNIQUE SOUND.I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO HIS SONGS SONCE 1965 AND UNTIL TODAY I STILL ENJOY HIS MUSIC. LISTEN TO ""COUNT ME IN"" "" ""PALISADES PARK"" ""THIS DIAMOND RING"" ""NEEDLES AND PINS"" ETC A REAL PLEASURE.NICE ,INNOCENT SONGS BUT FULL OF LIFE. I HOPE THAT WHOEVER LISTENS TO THIS CD OLD FANS OR NEW ONES WILL ENJOY IT."
3,A Rush Job,"I was so anxious to see these albums released in CD form. I figured they would be remixed and remastered up to CD quality. Even though I really like Gary Lewis and The Playboys' music, I was really disappointed. It sounds like they recorded them right off the old vinyl--thin sounding with all the instruments on one side and all the vocals on the other. It seems to me it was a rush job just to get it released before Christmas '99.The saving grace of the CD is the inclusion of BOTH flip sides of ""This Diamond Ring""--""Hard to Find"" and ""Tijuana Wedding."" These have been mixed into stereo for the first time, and if the rest of the CD sounded as good as these tracks, I would be a happy camper. If you want to hear better CD quality sound, get the re-released ""Everybody Loves A Clown/She's Just My Style,"" or ""Legendary Masters Series."" Maybe they could re-release this CD again doing it right the next time, and maybe even adding the rarity ""Malibu Run."" EMI Records: I hope you're listening."

3,Not worth the money,"Not worth the money for the following reasons: Yes, this monitor is wireless - for about 15 minutes (doesn't even make it thru one nap time)! I mostly used this monitor at night, and the night vision is in black & white. It produces a lot of static - so much so, that I had to turn off the sound completely - and what's the use of that!? Also, the picture quality is not so good, and gets worse over time."
4,Great Heavy Metal album!,"I would rate this 4 1/2 stars actually. If you have a thing for pure, untainted heavy metal that hasn't lost it's rock & roll edge, then you must check this album out. This isn't just another Sabbath inspired stoner band, these guys are brilliant and their songwriting and musicianship prove it. The Black Sabbath influence is everywhere, but Abdullah aren't afraid to throw in some early 80's metal influence and psychadellic elements (reminding me of Blue Cheer). So what we've got here is steroid pumped bluesy, dark and HEAVY rock n roll. If you love bands like Pentagram, The Obsessed, Pagan Altar, Diamond Head, Angelwitch, Judas Priest, Danzig, Solitude Aeturnus, St. Vitus, and newer bands like Place Of Skulls, and Spirit Caravan, you will drool over this cd. The only problem is, what's with the speed metal song at the end of the cd with the processed vocals? It definitely didn't fit on this album. But that's only one song out of 14 and every other one is a winner."
3,Very good...,"This well produced and well played blast-fest is an amazing doom/stoner record that cannot be overlooked! Thick guitar, aged but revitalized melodies and an Ozzy-with-balls whine on vocals make this some of the best Sab-inspired metal EVER... With brains and brawn (unlike most useless stoner-rock acts) this band brings an angry political/religious vibe that cuts to the heart of the matter. Death, misery and a silent cry for hope makes this record work...and I can't praise tracks like ""Black Helicopters"" and ""strange benedictions"" enough. The production and playing is top notch. This band will hopefully continue to bring new ideas and brilliance to doom and stoner metal. This record is classic in every sense of the word and needs to be hailed by more than just the few who've managed to snag it."
1,wow. . . . .,"another badly directed, badly acted over produced POS from hollywood. cool cars and hot babes does not equal a good movie."
2,Disgrace!,"What is bad + bad + plot hole + poor acting + amazing cars + hot women + more awful + death + criminals equal? You got it, its Redline! This script was seriously written by a million monkeys in a room with typewritters. I was there. It's definitely not Shakespeare, by any other name. The subscript of the title says, ""Hot women, Hotter cars,"" and I figured out why. It is because that is the only good to come from this movie. Millions of dollars went into making this movie, and the highest paid actor had to be Eddie Griffin because he is the only well-known actor in there. The writers got paid nothing...they were monkey's remember? Honestly, if you REALLY want to see it, rent it or borrow it from a friend. I was mad that I spent $12 on the movie when it came out on DVD. It is an okay movie to watch once...maybe one half. Definitely no more than that. Though, it is funnier the second time."
3,Redline,"A gorgeous young automobile fanatic--and front to the hottest unsigned band on the West coast--finds herself caught up in illegal drag-racing competitions organized for the pleasure of a bunch of bored billionaires. A great movie for people are who into Cars and girls. This is captivating for the younger, out going audience so I wouldn't expect any book club members to undersatnd the action."
2,What the heck...?,"The only reason I bought this is because the movie is cheap and I wanted to see exotic cars in action. The only saving grace of this movie is that it is cheap. The story is blah, and the cars couldn't even save this movie. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Not anywhere near as bad as Fastlane (2009),This is not anywhere near as bad as FastlaneFast Lanebut then it's not anywhere near as good as the first The Fast & the Furious either. The acting is wooden but watchable again not as bad as Fastlane. The cars are good and it's nice to see proper muscle car classics and super cars getting properley raced and crashed. View it as a good DTV movie and you'll be OK with it.The filming is not bad and the sound is quite good.Worth a watch if you know your super cars & muscle cars but don't pay much or rent it.
4,GREAT MIX,"This is a great collection, with the bonus of lots of TWP live tracks thrown in. The Wedding Present are not to be missed live, just for your information! They are brilliant and loud live! This really is a singles collection, and as great as the singles are, I am more an advocate of buying their actual albums... I advise you to get Seamonsters for sure!"
1,Don't bother wasting your time,This book is a total waste of time! It DOES NOT offer any useable material at all. As a biblical scholar and author myself it was a disappointment. It is now a paperweight i.e. useless.
1,no,One good song Major and Minor that comes with Sansa Fuze. The rest of it is unlistenable.I used to work at a recording studio.
3,dodge charger,this is the worst model i have ever goten the peices don't fit in right and you have to glue all most everthing because they won't stay
2,Not so nice....,"The photo of this necklace is not the same as the actual necklace. If you hold it up to the light it may appear the same, but when you put it on.... it doesn't reflect the colors..... Pretty disappointed. I got two different necklaces and they are the same.... Will not buy anymore."
5,Required Reading,"I enjoyed this book so much; I wish I had this relationship knowledge years ago. The author's advice and examples of how we find ourselves over involved in SUP's emotional negativity was excellent. In fact, the advice regarding family members worked, and I feel much less stress as a result. I have also shared the advice with friends and family. This book should be required reading in school so that young people could learn at an early age how to develop healthy relationships."
3,Too much talk too little advice,"As with many of the ""how to books"" each chapter starts with ""stories"" of people and their problems before it gets into the actual issue and solutions for it. I am not sure readers have the time or patience to wade through all the extraneous text and tests to find the answers they are seeking. Still, it might work for some, and it does contain kernels of valuable advice."
3,Good as far as I can tell,"Really HONESTLY I downloaded the book BECAUSE it sounded interesting, it was FREE, and I have yet to read it."
5,Girl Reppelent Too Little To Late,"Chris, Dave, Andy, and Chet, are all friends of mine and I was one of the first people to get this CD. I got this CD in 1997, and I still listen to it every day."
1,disappointed,"This plant was not healthy when i received it. I didnt even gibe it as a gift, as i intended, that how bad it looked."
5,Possibly Carly's best,"I'm a major Carly Simon fan and, of course, have all of her albums. This was the first one I got, and it's still my favorite."
4,Hotcakes scorches,"I must confess, even though I'm a fairly new fan of hers (I was born in 1985), sometimes Carly Simon gets a little too thought-provoking for my taste. Case in point: I don't know how the lyrics about ""Think I'm Gonna Have a Baby"" really mesh, like the repetative mentioning of ""they're putting out too many phonograph records..."" Oh well, maybe it's an inside joke. But who knows? Overall Hotcakes, Simon's fourth official record, is brilliant--it definitely is her second best album after 1971's No Secrets (due to the super smash song ""You're So Vain""). The standout track here is ""Haven't Got Time For The Pain,"" featuring some brilliant orchestral work with strings, but the aforementioned ""Think I'm Gonna Have a Baby"" is a great song as well. ""Mockingbird"" is a take on an older song, featuring then-husband James Taylor, and it's decent. Overall, Hotcakes is, like its name implies, a scorcher; not her best, No Secrets takes that, but a close follow-up."
5,No Secrets' sequel is really it's twin! A Classic!,"Carly released this masterwork right after the biggest album of her career, No Secrets, and it's is every bit as great. Safe and Sound starts it off, a pointed look at this crazy world we're in. Older Sister, anyone can relate to this song, brother or sister, and how we felt about our older siblings when we were that age. Just Not True is one of Carly's best vocal performances. Misfit, another relatable song. Grownup is simply beautiful. And of course the albums two biggest hits, need I really name them? The whole flow the album comes together perfectly, and contains some of Carly's best lyrics. A grade A+ release for sure!"
3,CARLY'S MATERNAL INSTINCTS,"HOTCAKES is Carly's response to her marriage to James Taylor and the impending arrival of their first child. Thus, the album is markedly optimistic and upbeat, even in its inevitable love songs. Even the album's cover looks like the cover of Parents magazine.Producer Richard Perry respects Carly's ""art imitating life"" approach by soaking the arrangements with acoustic instrumentation and tasteful strings. I'm not a big fan of HOTCAKES....the only song that has stuck with me is the emotionally charged HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN, highlighted by the expressive vocals and that awesome musical outro.Nonetheless, Simon's composing skills and individuality can't be denied and HOTCAKES affirms this---it's just not my favorite affirmation."
4,Bun in the Oven...,"...that's what happens next when you do a sexy album cover! Cute album cover this time by Carly and great slower less folky and more poppy tracks. Good album.Tracks to Download: Misfit, Grownup, Mockingbird, Havent got time for the pain."
5,An excellent start,This book is an excellent tool for those interested in curriculum development. It is simple enough to be understood for novice and complex enough for those with some experience.
2,Not For Educators,"If you are an educator, do not buy, or read this book unless you are forced to do so because a professor who hasn't taught in a classroom for 20 years chooses it as the book for your curriculum course. The authors attempt to make teachers feel low, unneeded, unknowing, and completely disrespected. These authors are ""getting paid"" by teachers to"" bad mouth"" teachers. They have no insight into the countless social ills which is a part of school systems. If they have any insight into social issues, they have chosen to limit the inclusion of research on the impact that social problems are having in the education system in their book. If teachers were even able to fix all the issues that plague our society while still educating the children involved in varied social issues, they would not be allowed to do so because some legislator without a clue says no."
3,Curr. Dev. Prac. Guide Rev.,"This book was a required title for a class I took. It was very interesting, but involved a lot more background than I had."
3,"Not too bad, but not great!","I have to give this a mixed review for a couple of reasons. The book that I recieved was not the book that I ordered. When I contacted the company to correct the mistake, the responce time was more than one day. Not as quick as I would have liked. Then it took an extra week for me to recieve the correct book, and classes had already begun. However, when I recieved the book it was in new condition (as described) and a postage paid mailing label and envelope for returning the incorrect book was included. I was very happy with that. I think I would give them one more try."
5,A truly amazing album,"LATE FOR THE SKY, is one of the greatest albums ever made. Jackson Browne, honestly describes so many human emotions, that many people cannot even put into words. The guitar work is absolutely fantastic. You can feel the pain in each chord. No album has ever moved me the way this one does. Its peacefulness and beauty are just the greatest feelings. Wow. I just listened to the album, and I had to write about.""I got no reason to feel this good!"""
5,Miserablism never sounded so good...,"Jackson Browne is often criticised for being too gloomy. Lyrics such as ""maybe people only ask you how you're doing/'cos its easier than letting on how little they can care"" may add weight to this, but the lush musical settings, brilliant musicianship, and Jackson's superb vocal performances on every track lift the songs in this classic collection to rarely-scaled heights. After so many years it remains his best, establishing his introspective but uplifting style as surely as ""Blue"" did for Joni Mitchell (who he supported on tour in his early days). ""Fountain of Sorrow"", ""For a Dancer"", ""After the Deluge"" and the title track were all instant favourites on first hearing and have been diminished not one whit by the passing years; if anything their lambent melancholy is more moving than ever. A great album."
2,Should Have Been an Instrumental Record,"I owned this album on vinyl when I was in college back in the 1970s, and haven't thought about it much since then. Recently I overheard a co-worker playing it in her office and I sat down to listen for a while. Two things struck me. One - David Lindley's electric guitar and lap steel accompaniment are perfect. Two - Browne's maudlin and self confessional lyrics are almost insufferable."
5,A Classic from a Classic Era!,Classic Jackson Browne music and lyrics. A collection of some of the best of one of the best singer-songwriters in the latter 20th Century. These songs still resonate decades later.
5,One of the greatest Cds I've ever heard!!!,"I'll say it straight up: this Cd changed my life. Not the everyday things, like going up and going to work/Uni/whatever, but the way I *perceived* life, they way I listened to songs, the way I viewed relationships. I knew jackson's music pretty well, loving Running on Empty, Hold Out...but then I discovered this Cd and I couldn't believe I had lasted so long without it. I found it difficult to find in Oz, (I originally bought it as a poor student on LP and taped it!!!) and was actually just about to order it, when I came across it in a store today. This is what inspired me to write. I have played it 3 times already tonight and some of the tracks bring a tear to my eye. Its all highlights, but Im especially fond of ""The Late Show"", ""Late for the Sky"" and ""Fountain of Sorrow""; but its all killer, no filler. As a last note I saw jackson perform live earlier this year at the Sydney Opera House, and it was amazing. You rule Jackson!! Please tour Oz again!!!"
5,Money saver!,"Back in 1974, I rushed from the kitchen to the living room to find out who the voice was playing. Since then, I have saved thousands of dollars in buying new album. This is a must."
5,A beautiful collection of musical poetry,"I've recently turned several friends on to the music of Jackson Browne. I first heard his music when my older sister handed me his albums during my first teenage heartbreak. That year he became a staple in my musical life and my lyrical god.Although my parents and sister have turned me onto Dylan, Mitchell, King, Nero, Taylor and Simon. To this day, I have yet to hear a singer/songwriter that brings so much emotion and such a connection to my life as Jackson Browne. He's by far the best ever and this recording only proves that he was just beginning to create a legacy that reigns to this very day. His music and lyrics are never dated. Always essential."
5,This is by far my favorite Jackson Browne album ever made,Late for the sky is a great album to listen to if you're going through a rough spot in a relationship.
3,BAB Album 3,"The expertise of these guys is beyond comparison. By themselves they are the best. Together they are in a universe by themselves.But I didn't care so much for the collection of songs. IMO, Albums 1 and 2 had more of the traditional songs, but polished to perfection. There are a lot, lot more of the traditional stuff they could have used, and I would have loved to hear them done by these guys. Delivery was great, selection could have been much better."
3,Nothing Great,"Some good tunes, some bad ones. The band just lacks that ""dirty"" sound, an integral part of any bluegrass band. They do a good job on ""Big Spike Hammer"" and ""Down the Road"", but nothing makes up for the dullness in ""I'd rather be Alone"", ""Unfaithful One"", ""Hey Lonesome"" and ""Please Search your Heart"", which has to be one of the most painful songs to listen to on this album."
4,FINISHING BECCA ...a book with many layers.,"I just finished reading FINISHING BECCA, a book that I picked up as a possible addition to a cross-curriculum unit that I present (I'm an 8th grade English teacher) with an American History teacher. We already use MY BROTHER SAM IS DEAD, and APRIL MORNING. Both are outstanding and written from young boys' perspectives. In the past, we've also used THE WITCH OF BLACKBIRD POND, but I have been disappointed with the ""meat"" of the book in comparison to the other two. I was looking for something of substance from a female perspective, and I believe that FINISHING BECCA meets or surpasses the ""meaty"" requirement. Ann Rinaldi is authoritative in her grasp of the nuances of American's Revolution, and she gives a very respectable presentation of Benedict Arnold's betrayal. I highly recommend the book."
4,Spectacular! Makes you feel like your actualy there!!,"Finishing Becca is about a 14-year-old girl named Becca Synge in the Revolutionary War in 1778. When Becca goes to work for the Shippens and for their spoiled, beautiful daughter-Peggy, her world is turned upside down. Then she must also work for her mistress new husband, the despised by all towns-people, merciless, rich- Benedict Arnold. Becca is faced with many decisions, is she should be loyal to her family, to her country, or to her mistress. With all this in mind she must concentrate on trying to find her ""missing pieces"" as her mother puts it. But then she watches in shock as her Mistress-Peggy urges to turn Benedict Arnold against the Continental army and all of the Patriots, to join the British."
2,pretty boring,"This book is a very good book if you are into historicalfiction, are doing a report for school, or into learning about famous people long ago. If not this book may bore you. It did to me and I could'nt finish it. I'm sorry for all rthe people who like this book but I couldn't find anything great about it. but then again i like realistic fiction books. not historical. I hope this review was helpful!"
2,Not one of her best...,I believe this is one of Rinaldi's weakest story ever! The lack of fluency made this book hard to read. The only reason I believe that this book deserves attention is for the fact that it was a story about the once well acclaimed captain Benedict who decided to turn against the americans for the crown because of her silly selfish wife.
4,Finishing Becca,"I think that the book Finishing Becca by Ann Rinaldi is very interesting. Ann makes you feel as if you were there experiencing what Becca was. This book has just enought romance, history, and adventure to satisfy almost any reader."
2,"A good topic, poorly executed","I purchased this book because I was reminded of a favorite from my childhood, Peggy by Lois Duncan, which is no longer in print. I wanted to revisit the history of Peggy Shippen from another author's point of view. I was torn as I read the book whether to keep going or put it down because I was interested in the historical characters but bored with the created ones. Yet even the historical characters were drawn thinly with no credible foundation for their actions. Additionally, the author's choice of words (soup bubbling on the hearth--so cliche!) and methods of conveying story (talking to the cow?) were intrusive and jarring. While this is a great topic for a historical novel that can spur readers to explore parts of history on their own, I think that the book itself is poorly executed and would have benefited from a focused editing."
4,A great book,"Finishing Becca is about a servant who works for a 16 year old girl who marries Benedict Arnold. It was a great book, and I enjoyed it very much but I think the whole Benedict Arnold point took a long time to get into. When she started talking about it, the book was more than halfway over. Otherwise, this was a great book, and I would reccomend it."
5,Utterly Amazing!,"Finishing Becca was a wonderful book with much thought put into it, although there were some uneeded parts. Usually in stories such as this one the setting is non-fiction with mostly fictional characters, but unlike those books Ann Rinaldi has included mostly non-fictional characters and though a few of the characters were fictional, it seemed as though they would jump right off of the pages. If there were more stars, this book would have 10!"
3,used big brother book review,the book spine is in decent condition but the write up did not specify that there was highlighting and writing to this extent in the book. It was listed as like new.
1,Whole language at its worse.,"I can't imagine teaching at risk children with this view of the world of real reading research. Texas and California were unmitigated whole language disastors, not that Mr. Allington and his crew will ever own up."
1,a real snoozer,"ok,no big deal here, just another cd that wraps the 'blues' in a plain white box. Nothing edgy here, just some near dead grooves with Beaver Cleaver on vocals. zzzzzzz......."
2,not inspiring,I like this book even less than the other reviewer. There are much better products out there to stencil a border or other projects than this book. Too simplistic.
4,Great Game - Tough Directions,"This is a wonderful game I discovered from a friend earlier this year. It's fun with a lot of people. The only problem is that the first time I played it, I learned how to play from someone else. When I bought this product, I attempted to understand the rules from the unclear instructions, and got a bit lost.Otherwise, it's great. It's simple and fun."
4,Very handy,A must have for air travel! I am sure this is a good plane bag. All women should have this product in their carry on.
4,"Nevermind if the movie is not great, it's still fun!","SNL alums Will Ferrell(before he went 'Elf' on us) and Chris Kattan play dumb, club-hopping brothers from LA. Both stars are hilarious because they never score with the ladies while at the clubs. They come up with the worst lines, which makes it even funnier.OK, so it didn't win any Oscars, but i know it's not good. In fact, it's only the very few films I admit I enjoyed. The Butabi brothers are so over the top, I can't help myself laugh. The story is non-existent, but the characters help carry this film. It's pure escapist fun. I want to get the DVD, but I'm afraid to buy it!"
4,Good for a few laughs,If you a fan of Will Ferrell then you're sure to enjoy this!! Taking from a skit on SNL and is just hilarious I think!
4,Surprisingly funny,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this movie, but found it so amusing I too watched it 5 times before I took it back! Some funny gags. I found this funnier than Something About Mary. But maybe that's not saying too much..."
3,not a 5star but its good,good movie with simularites to dumb and dumber but it not a 5 star movie by far it lacks charictor info and it gets boring in some partsbut the soundtrack it good
5,Hilarious,This is one of the greatest movies ever. I can never get enough of this movie and the laughs it dishes out. This movie is a must see for all.
4,Great deal,"When buying this product used i was a little leery, but when i received it i was very pleased! The movie was just ""like new"" as was stated on the information when i bought it. I didn't want to spend the extra money to buy the new movie, so i got a great deal and bought the used one and I'm very happy with it."
3,"Hilariously funny, but got old after awhile.","The first couple minutes were really humorous, but I found that they over used the same joke and it got to be boring."
1,a night at the roxbury,"one of the funniest movies i have seen on vcd, unfortunately on this website, this dvd version was in region 1 (usa market)not region 2 for the european market. very badly advertised!!!!!"
1,I'm sorry but I didn't find this movie funny,"First off: what happened to the just natural humor that the early 90's SNL cast brought. The new cast just isn't funny. They try too much to live up to the greats (Chris Farely, David Spade, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, Dana Carvey, etc.)but they don't realize that they will never be as funny as them. This movie is a perfect example of that. SNL went from actual humor to just 2 hours of ongoing sex jokes. Although I did laugh at the Roxbury SNL skits, this movie just made me dissapointed, along with other SNL movies like Superstar and a couple others. They should just give up now. The old SNL cast was a legend. This time, it's just a wannabe joke. Watch the Roxbury skits and save your money on the movie.""A Night At The Roxbury"" runs for about 90 minutes. It is rated PG-13 for sexual humor and language."
2,Like many other SNL films,"A lot of films based on SNL characters unsurprisingly fail at the box office because of the inability to actually develop the characters. The only exception, and everyone knows this, is ""Wayne's World"" with the exception of the sequel. ""A Night At The Roxbury"" follows the two misadventures of Steve and Doug Butabi, two hopeless romantics and brothers who spend their days irritating their dad (Dan Hedaya) at his plastic plant shop, and their nights at attempted club hopping which results in them getting shunned away by the doorman. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are very talented but they try to make their SNL characters real and it just doesn't work. Everyone knows the theme of the overplayed and now familiarly known as the Roxbury Theme. The problem is, the film just doesn't seem to go anywhere. It gets inevitably boring and recycles jokes in the movie continually. Look for then unknown Michael Clarke Duncan as a doorman."
1,Oh....My....GOD,"Ok, this was absolutly the stupidest movie I've ever seen. I love the skits these two do on SNL, but this was just awful. AWFUL. I wanted Mango to burst in and bash their heads together repeatedly. NO.....YEEEEEEESSSS!"
1,THE WORST MOVIE OF 1998,"This movie was very short. It lasted less than an hour an a half. Although it could have been more funny, the jokes were forced and annoying. The preview of the movie showed all the 'funny' moments."
1,STUPID,"I thought that this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my whole enire lfie. Supid plot...actually, there was no plot. Supid characters. I saw it and I counted only 2 funny parts in the movie. And all of the jokes were repeats on earlier jokes in the movie. C'mon give me a break. I anybody did like this movie, well then they must have been in a REALLY, REALLY GOOD MOOD when they saw this movie."
1,Beyond Stupid,"I thought this thing would never end,if I had known how bad this movie was going to be I would have just burnt my money. Take my advice,if you are on a plane and this movie is showing,walk out."
4,Quite Entertaining,"I immensly enjoyed this movie. Intentionally stupid and corny to an extreme, it nevertheless kept me laughing out loud for almost the entire film. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan were hilarious, as well as many of the other actors. I love the way this movie used many of the typical movie clichés in an exaggerated or twisted way, making them very funny.To really like this movie, you have to realize it is not about to meaningfully affect your life or stun you with its originality or clever plot. But if you are looking for something enjoyable to make you laugh I would recommend this film, especially to all you Will Ferrell fans. Due to the number of poor reviews I would suggest seeing it before you buy it, to see if this movie is really for you."
4,Just lighten up,If movies like this actually took THEMSELVES seriously I could understand the horrid reviews. But this is just a goofy movie that doesn't set out to be more than that. It's funny.
5,Love it,I am so happy to be an owner of A Night At The Roxbury. I love this movie more then I can explain. It is so very funny. Even my friend and I do the head dance to music together whenever we are jamming out. Just like the brothers do in the car. This is a great movie. You don't want to pass this up.
5,THIS MOVIE WAS SO HILARIOUS!!!,This movie was the funniest one I have seen. All of you people who hate it have no sense of humor. It's just supposed to be funny and it's not supposed to have some serious plot. GET A SENSE OF HUMOR!!!! THIS MOVIE WAS DA BOMB!!!!!
4,Fun movie on a great DVD,"Not knowing what to expect, I rented this DVD from NetFlix and, in spite of myself, I found myself laughing hysterically (so much so, my dog started barking at me). It is a laugh-out-loud funny movie. I definitely intend to buy this DVD, it has great crystal clear picture and aweseome 6-track surround sound. DVD, by, the way, is the way to go!!"
3,An overall creative film,"You certainly want to feel sorry for these two social losers. Two brothers, with the ambition of owning a social club, suddenly discover that their sorry existances have, by a sudden car accident, elevated to a higher position than they ever imagined. The movie portrays them both as intensely likable characters, and you want to root for them. It is a pleasant surprise to see that they do achieve exactly what they wanted. However, they are clearly naive, not able to keep the girls, nor their status. It is fairly humorous, even though I didn't think it would when I first began watching it. An overall creative film.And sadly, yes, many of us guys do dance like that in clubs. I'm not among them.Michael Gordon"
1,Not funny,"Comedy isn't the ""artistic cinema"" Dalva76 craves (earlier post), but, getting past my hilarity over that, I can appreciate the ""artistic cinema"" in great comedy and say flat out that this ain't it. Now, before you think I'm a snob, I laughed myself silly over ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" And I was prepared to hate it. I liked ""Dumb and Dumber."" I LIKE stupid humor when it's really smart humor disguised as stupid. But after 15 minutes of ""Roxbury,"" all I sensed was stupid -- and I sure wasn't going to sit around for 80 more minutes of it."
3,Funny But Not Hilarious,"The movie was better than the SNL skit. I hate watching it on Snl. It was pretty funny, and I would have given it 5 stars, but I don't generally give comedies such high priase. They aren't really the artistic cinema I crave."
1,As a cancer survivor....,As a cancer survivor I must say that this film made me laugh. As a cancer survivor I also must say that cancer is not fun gang.
5,Five stars for what it is....,"...not what it's not. Folks, this isn't Chariots of Fire or The Hours. It's a funny story of two good-hearted losers whose dream is to meet hot chicks and open a night club. That's it. It's not groundbreaking. It doesn't define an era. It's funny as heck, good characters, pretty funny situations, hot chicks, and a fun ending. It's an hour and a half of fun and great dance tunes. People compare this to ""It's Pat."" Not in my book, ""It's Pat"" was pretty plotless and largely unwatchable. This has a real plot, a ton more people in it, and great music. Plus, I think this was made with a real budget."
5,this movie is champ,"""I'm Doug Butabi"" ""i'm Steve Butabi"" ""your brothers?"" ""nooo!"".....""yes! "" (high fives...) ""man! gets em every time!"" i love this movie... is got the Amelio! story that they tell a hundred times... is so stupidly funny! love it!"
5,The sweetest movie ever made!,Night at the Roxbury is the funniest movie I've ever seen! SNL RULES!!
5,ROXBURY RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE ROXBURY!!!I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE THOSE GUYS !THOSE GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,This is one of the greatest snl based comedies to date,"This movie reminded me of Tommy Boy and other numerous snl based movies. I am a personal fan of snl so i really enjoyed this movie. I recomend this to most teenagers. Everyone at my school is bobbing their heads and saying, ""What's up."""
3,This was a funny takeoff from the Saturday Night Live skit,Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan take the Butabi brothers to a full length film. They work very well together and give the audience a lot of laughs. Molly Shannon is hilarious as the randy neighbor and Loni Anderson is perfect as the typical Hollywood mother. I recommend this film.
4,This video was really cool,"i totally loved this movie! but i would say thats it only appeals to a certain age group. Basicaly teens who want to have a few good laughs, and thats what it is! anyone who liked the original sketch will love this movie. All though it is inapproprtiate for children at parts, i would say it is an all around fun movie."
4,bullseye sarcastically funny,I already watched this movie on TV> I decide to purchase the DVD.I think these two guys are funny and really make you hope you don't ever really meet someone in life like them! Anyway-they are entertaining and that's why you watch a movie!!
4,HILARIOUS!!!!,It's even funnier the fourth time you see it!!! Its nice to go back every once in a while and see how Kattan & Ferrell got there start:)
5,If you don't see it you're missing out,I never planned to see this movie until my niece told me about it and then one day it came on Showtime and I liked it a lot and I recommend this movie if you like stupie kinda funny. All I wanna say is this is one of the best comedy movies of all time.
4,One of the funniest movies Ive seen...,I loved this movie... it was creative and funny. It mad me laugh and want to watch it over and over. There were some parts that were slow but other than that it was great and I recommend it to anyone.
4,Uh..Look at these two Auqa Velvas,"I sure hope a sequel is in the works.Another no-brainer. Laugh Riot...Doug Butabi,Steve Butabi!Your brothers? Noooo,YesssThats very funny.You ever heard this one? You cant come innnn.A small hurdleat the Roxbury.No problem for the Virgin Dance KingsJust get Grieco to help and the owner to Like you.Piece of Cake.Unless dad takes the car keys.Dan Hedeya is great as theirDad.(you know,Nick Tortellifrom Cheers)Did you ever think Loni Anderson playingthe role of an older Mom.Thats like Farrah Fawsettplaying a Grandma.Some things just dont blend.The movie still turned outgreat even with the original director walking out after 3 days."
4,Very funny.,This is a really funny movie. This is a must see. I dont really know what alse to say exept that if you like saturday night live then watch this movie because this is a grate skit from the show not the hole thing offcorse but it is based on there carictors.
5,A stupid but hilarious movie,"I thought that A Night at the Roxbury was a hilarious movie. You could say that it was one of those movies where it was so stupid it was funny and you would be half right. Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell are hilarious in this movie as brothers Doug and Steve Butabi. Molly Shannon was also really good as Emily, the eager neighbor. I suggest you see this movie if you want to have a great time with a funny movie."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVA!!,"This movie is IT. I love it. You have to buy this movie if ur up for stand-up comedy, funky music that will make u jump up and dance and funny ""love"". Chris Kattan is a genius! Will Ferrell is funny! BUY IT NOW!"
5,Funny and I like the beat! It's easy to dance to!,"This movie is soooooo funny! My husband and I have watched it about 5 times already on cable and I want to buy the movie too, just to have it. The cast is talented and funny and the music during the whole movie is great - alot of dance tunes.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone. You won't be disappointed.Sandra"
4,REALLY FUNNY,This movie is a must have if you like the SNL actors. We watch it when ever we need a laugh! Great movie
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,It was like watching a 2 hour saterday night live scit. It is funny for 2 mins but when you turn it into a movie it becomes as boring as watching the grass grow. (i write reviews and own the long island youth film society)
1,1 star,"I was not pleased with the fact that from my droid phone, where I purchased the dvd i wasnt made more aware that it was NOT viewable in the US. I bought this dvd and have emailed the seller several times trying to return it and I havent gotten a reply. Very disappointed."
1,A Night at the Roxbury,"Now in addition to my first review of my purchase involving far too long leadtimes for simple dvd delivery, I come to find out this new DVD did not ""read"", hence it did not work. Extremely disappointed with my all around experience with this purchase."
3,I Wish it had Never Been Made,"All I can offer is a warning: You'll never be able to sing or hear the song ""What is Love?"" again without laughing."
5,Ferrell and Kattan at their best,This is a great movie. It's got some awesome dancing and disco scenes. The movie is extremely funny. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are at their best in this movie. If you thought the T.V. skits were funny it is a hundred times better in the video. A must see for any Ferrell fan!
1,Students review,"Used this dvd in my classes this semester. The students far preferred the Jason Connery version. They didn't care for the interpretation from the dvd at all. The teaching plans etc. were good, however, I'm not sure that they were worth the $30.00."
1,Crucial Element Missing,"I am a teacher of Literature and English at Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. Yes, I teach Shakespeare to my deaf and hard of hearing high school students. This DVD sounds terrific...except IT IS NOT CLOSE CAPTIONED! and it's an educational DVD! Almost everything is now close captioned, so why not an educational DVD? Very disappointing. I would certainly purchase and recommend to other teachers and deaf and hard of hearing adults if it was....CLOSE CAPTIONED ."
4,Educational DVD for Everyone!,This DVD is so cool! I was having a hard time understanding Macbeth so I went online to see if I could get some help. Someone on a chat line told me about this DVD and I am so glad. I learned so much and it even had great extras for teaching (which I shared with my teacher). My older sister said she wished she had something like this to help her understand Macbeth. Hope they make more of these!
4,Quite Good,"Although the production of this video is a little weak, I have to say that some of the acting is great and the educational extras we're pretty helpful in teaching this play to my class."
5,Adictive,I am only sorry that this series didn't have more serie's available. I really enjoyed it became adictive.I watched two or three shows a night for awhile. Just couldn't get enough.
5,Such a beautiful series!,"This television program has become my absolute favorite. It is clean and violence free! It is so visually pleasing too! I recommend it to anyone, but especially if you like decent, good period dramas. This one is top notch!"
1,Doesn't work on my Blu Ray player.,"I bought this for my wife's birthday. Unfortunately, it did not work on my Sony BDP-5370. This is the first blu-ray that has not worked on this player. Toy Story 3 worked just fine. As an alternative I downloaded the PC version from Amazon which worked good other than an occasional scan line or two. This is a great series according to my wife. She ripped through the other two seasons which we were able to get from Netflix on disc. I may have to buy a new player. This one is not even a year old yet."
1,Darwinism & Witchcraft,"It's too bad that the writers of this show could not help but slam Christianity and promote their views of darwinism and witchcraft. Their hatred for anything from Christendom comes through so loud and clear, that the acting was at times way overdone; almost 'comical' and contrived. The writers' views are so saturated in episode 2, that my wife and I finally just turned it off. We are Christians and did not expect that such an 'innocent' production would take on such hatred towards a particular group or religion. We are truly disappointed in the BBC."
4,good,"The plotlines open up, the B and C and D story lines flourish beautifully even as Miss Lane and Mr. Timmins grow stiffer and more moralistic. Hope season four will get the stick out of their *****."
2,Not so good,"Not withstanding rave reviews, because of which I bought this series, I must object. The postman charactor was so bad as to make one disc all I could watch before I put the whole thing up for resale. Stupid is the only way I can chatactorise the way this role was written. Unbelievable is another word as the rest of the story line is quite good. The female roles are well done and the photography-location is excellent."
1,larkrise to candleford,Still waiting for the refund. Maybe I wasn't paying attention but got a BluRay when I was expecting DVD. Sent back 10/15/10
3,English version of 'Leave it to Beaver',The sun is always shining and everything turns out OK after a few problems. Gratuitous women's and worker's rights with a bit of romance and clowning thrown in.
5,I love this show!,The characters are endearing. The story lines do not drag on forever. I wish there were more seasons. I love it.
5,Loved this show!,"I loved watching this entire series--all four seasons--on my iPad! The characters remained consistently charming and loveable from episode to episode, but grew emotionally in believable ways. The scenery and cinematography was breathtaking at times. A sweet, gentle, but real life problems show not meant for the reality tv-loving crowd."
5,perfect for a rainy day,"Lark Rise is your cup of tea and a warm blanket on a rainy day.The characters are rich and real and I can watch with my 2 year old son as there is no violence. I love a costume drama, and this series is filled with great plots and lush scenery and farm animals dropping in every now and again to keep the boy interested.I've watched the whole series now- all 4 seasons, and I only wish they'd not end.Lovely stuff"
5,I Have Always Loved British Television,"I Chose this product because I was introduce to this product by a competitor of Amazon Instant Video, as AIV did not exist just yet, but all they had was one season and did not seem to be moving to get any more. I would look for it on Amazon and of course Amazon had it, but It would be the whole season and that could get pricy as well as it would sometimes be an international format and I was concerned I would spend the money on a blue ray version, get it here and not be able to play it in my machine. But with the Amazon Instant Video and the Prime Promotion I have access to Episode by Episode and the options to purchase individually or as a season. There are just more options with Amazon Instant Video."
5,Lark Rise to Candleford,This is a wonderful series. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed watching all three seasons. I hope they continue with more seasons. We enjoyed the characters and the story line.
2,Disappointed with blue ray disc,My disappointment is not with the series - I love it - but rather with this blue ray disc. The package arrived when expected and looked perfect. We slipped the first disc into our blu Ray player and nothing came up. We tried several discs in the series and none would work in our player. We tried a blu Ray movie which we have - and it played perfectly.The shining lite in this comment is Amazon and how good they are to their customers. I called with my complaint on the blu Ray disc and they were so kind and understanding. I was able to send it back to amazon within 24 hours and they refunded me for the disc. I did not order another disc from the company as I did not want to experience another error. But I love Amazon and their return policy. They are the best as a purchasing company. Thank you Amazon
4,I loved it,I really enjoyed this show. I wish season 3 did not get cut short. Great Characters from Lark Rise to Candleford.
2,"Enough! Show me the exit, please","I liked the first two seasons, couldn't wait to get to the next episode then.But somehow in Season 3 this series went on autopilot. Laura's going to fall in love with every young stranger who comes to town and get her heart broken. Thomas Brown is going to find something to sputter incoherently about. His wife will wear her perpetual dazed/confused expression. Alf and his siblings will still be prating about happily (Parents? What parents?). Dorcas will respond to every situation with a series of pretty smiles and her feminine wiles. I feel I've seen every expression Julia Sawalha has.I have to agree with the person who complained about the music. It's grating and for the last 12 eps I've had to mute the sound at the beginning and end because they play the same tiresome theme over and over.Enough. Go on without me."
2,Stop the music,By the time I got to season 2 the background music is just too much to handle. The characters/plots got so ridiculous and some of those who should have been adored became idiotic and just so unbelievable. I don't think I'll get thru the last season 2 or 3 of this show. I wanted to strangle some of the characters! I purchased all 3 seasons as I had an accident which left me sedentary for quite a while....I'd rather stare at the ceiling than listen to that music/theme again.
4,Jon Butcher - Soundtrack to our current Gulf War,Give a listen to this - Holy War Rocks! Must listen to at full volume
4,Spitfire Pilot,This is a delightfully informative naration clearly describing not only every day life in the UK during the war years but also the appalling loss of life in the air.It is hard to imagine the fear and extreme adrenaline rushes these pilots were exposed to and then to return to base at the end of the day and try to resume some normality in life....what an extreme contrast and emotional roller coaster.This is a recommended read to all with an interest in aviation.
5,Dead Witch Walking,"Dead Witch Walking is a fun romp with a White Witch named Rachel.She's been kicked out of a government agency similar to the F.B.I. but with all agents being supernatural; like werewolves, vampires, and in Rachel's case a witch.Her old agency is now out to kill her. Her best friend and one of her partners is a vampire whom Rachel is not sure if she wants to drink her blood.Her other partner is a macho pixie. He may be small in stature but he's big of heart .Kim Harrison writes with a distinct sense of humor. I have laughed out loud many times while reading this.The story combines a good mystery story with a lot of humor and is Very Enjoyable. !"
5,Great new author,This is the first in a series about Rachel a witch who is also a bounty hunter. Rachel lives with a living vampire and a pixie family. This set is awesome. If you like Laurel K. Hamilton you will love Kim Harrison.
3,spoiler alert,"This is the first free 'teaser book' I've liked enough to read the following books in the series. It has some of the common flaws in detective stories - why does the heroine insist on placing herself in danger over and over again? But both the fantasy world created and the tough lady detective are charming. But my main reason in adding to the many many reviews is to warn Kindle readers not to read the introductory chapter of the newest book which is at the end. 'Dead Witch..' is number one in a series, the newest book is something like 7 - it was disorienting to find that so much changed, and now that I'm reading number two (from the library, sorry Kim)I can see all the foreshadowing, it's driving me crazy."
4,Great Series; Good First Book,"This book starts out painfully slow, I think; however, it really picks up at the end. (Trust me, by the 2nd or 3rd book you will be HOOKED.)"
5,Anita Blake w/o the junk,"This is an immensely enjoyable book, very similar to the Anita Blake series, but without the pointless sex that has begun to plague all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books. I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book. It started well. Then the author threw in one new thing after another. The characters are ok, the world is fresh and inventive -- but the rules kept changing. I couldn't settle down and start believing in the world, because some new ability or restriction kept showing up arbitrarily. In the end, I was tired of trying to follow the changes, and didn't really care any more."
5,Love - Love - Love,I love every book in this series. Its grown up. Its Funny. Its sexy. Its just worth a try. P.S. Tink ROCKS
1,Ugh...,"This series was recommended by a friend. At least I thought she was a friend. I don't know if she even likes me after having read the first book of this series. It was close to torture. It takes A LOT for me to not like a book. I can read almost ANYTHING, but this book... I can't even put it into words. I had to force myself to finish reading this and when I was done all I kept saying to myself was ""WTH was that and what did I do to my friend to tick her off?"" What really drives me insane is that I was so revved up by her praise for series this is I went out and bought the first three books right away. Now I have two books sitting around that will more than likely NEVER be read."
2,Difficult to get through,"This book had potential. It has some interesting characters, a fairly cool plot and some moments of suspense. Unfortunately Harrison's writing style is tedious and many of her characterizations unbelievable, especially the lead character's confused sexual persona. The world she creates--the ""Turn"" with ""Inderlanders"" and ""live"" and ""dead"" vampires are not explained well and serve to add to the tedium of slogging through the story.Not a book or a series I would recommend -- I am an Anita Blake/Sookie Stackhouse/Weather Warden fan. This one just doesn't cut it."
1,Horribly lacking!,"I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews of this book -- it's incredibly boring and poorly written. I love paranormal fiction but this is the worst novel I've come across. It is the 1st book I actually did not finish and I have never not finished a book before (no matter how drab). It seems like the author didn't think the book through and just started writing it. There's no structure, characters are not 3 dimensional, and plot appears randomly contrived. Save your $$, don't buy it, trust me! If you want great paranormal series try: Richelle Mead (Vampire Academy, Succubus Blues, Storm Born) or Mortal Instruments."
1,Didn't like the book,I agree with the reviewer who said this was a mishmash of a book. I hoped the book would get better - but it never did. This book is no comparision to the Anita Blake series - skip it.
1,Very disappointing,"This book was a huge let-down! The writing was repetitve and dull. Rather than explaining some concepts, like ""going vamp"" they were just used over and over again. It seemed as though every few encounters someone was experiencing nausea, feeling sick, or feeling ill. Rachel was exceptionally paranoid about her supposed partner Ivy and the most relatable character was Jenks the pixie.I kept reading in the hopes that something would change for the better but it just continued with the same lackluster performance. It was compared to the Anita Blake series which is a complete disservice to that series and author."
3,"the first is decent, the sequels much better","I wasn't sure if I really liked this book. It is entertaining and the characters are interesting, but the writing isn't tight. I read the second book to see if it got better, and it did. The different story lines become more integrated and Rachel, who isn't a terribly sympathetic character, becomes more likeable. My big complaint is the number of typos in all the books; a proofreader would have helped tremendously. I also find the use of the same phrases and descriptions in each book monotonous. The books can be read seperately, as there are explanations of previous events in each book (which can make them drag if you've read them in order), but are better if read in sequence. Although not great literature, the books are fun, and the world Harrison creates is complex and rich. So, get through the first and enjoy the 2nd and 3rd books in the series."
3,Alright...,"I picked up this book because of the glowing reviews for it. I thought this book was good, but I didn't start getting into it till around page 200!It took me almost 2 weeks to finish this book, which is shocking because I usually read books within a few hours of starting. I kept starting read a chapter or so, then I would be bored or sidetracked with something else. It took me 2 weeks to get to around page 200, where I started actually getting interested and finished the rest of the book within the day. I'm not sure why this happened, the writing was good, the plot was okay, the characters were not too interesting except Jenks, but it failed to hold my attention in the first hundred pages, after a hundred pages or the so the story picked up and it was good. Despite, not having such a good time with the first book, I picked up the second book and hopefully the second one is better."
3,dead witch walking,"i am the type that buys all the books in a series and read one right after the other,so when ""dead witch walking"" the first book lost my interest i just figured aw it's just the first book but then i am up to book 6 and i'll tell ya it has been a rough way to go.i can't put my finger on what i am finding lacking because i do like rachel and ivy's friendship and living in a church,there is something missing.the covers make the books look so appealing.these books aren't keepers they are resalers.i want a book i can't put down and can't wait for the next one,for me ""hollows"" is hard to get thru one then to another."
3,Very Interesting Characters,"I've really enjoyed this book. Rachel seems a very complex character. She is an ex-cop, going after the bad guys. But completely naive to how the I.S. would respond to her quitting. I've really enjoyed this series."
3,Good Start to Series Love Jinx,"I enjoyed this book. Everything from Jinx and his toothpick(sword for him) to learning about this fun world the Hollows. While I`m undecided about how I really feel about Ivy I just think her relationship with Rachel is an odd one. I do find the Ivy, Rachel, Kisten triangle creepy and I'm glad he wasn't really in this book because of Ivy's territory issues. I`m also glad e-book edition is an option because I hate the cover. Its one of the reasons I avoided ever reading it I didn't want it on a bookshelf."
3,Choppy read,"I'm always on the lookout for a new author or a new series to read; this one sounded like a possibility. Unfortunately, I have found this to be a bit of a rough read. Some parts flow fairly well, while others just read as unfinished or not fully thought out. This takes place in an alternate reality world, but there are just too many things that are not explained or don't make sense. As a result, I have been reading this in spurts and starts, something I don't normally do."
3,A lot of promise...,"This book started out with a lot of promise and a great idea, but it became just another lead-in to a series...the conclusion was contrived and predictable."
3,I will have to read more in the series,"I am having a hard time caring about the characters in this series. It is not a must read for me, so it is taking a while to get through it. I will read the next book to see if I enjoy it more."
2,"Decent plot, hard to follow writing style...","I am almost done with this book and I am finding myself leaning towards previous reviewer Jeffrey Hammond's comments. Although this book has a decent and somewhat entertaining plot, the writing style is so choppy and confusing that you sometimes find yourself plodding along slowly. I am an avid reader (I read 2 books a week) and I constantly found myself double checking sentences to make sure I had read them correctly. I am going to try the second book in the series(I hope the author gets a much better editor though!). The book DID start to get better towards the end though and I will try the second book in the series out to see what else happens with the character. If you want to read something similar to this than check out The Anita Blake series, The Sookie Stackhouse series (My personal favorite series) or anything by Kelley Armstrong (Especially BITTEN and STOLEN.)"
3,Okay First Book,"I decided to read this book based on all the excellent reviews & was disappointed. The book starts off VERY slowly. I ended up skipping whole sections because it was too boring. I only kept reading because TV was reruns. I'm glad I stuck with it. The book defintely picked up in the second half & I enjoyed it, even though I found some of the action pretty contrived & unbelievable i.e. for a bunch of supposedly savvy good guys, they repeat the same stupid move against the bad guy multiple times. The characters got more interesting, especially the mysterious businessman and human sidekick. Even Rachel got less annoying (I was getting sick of her dropping into a defensive crouch everytime the wind blew the wrong way - I get it, you're a tough lady). I can't say whether it's worth getting involved in this series yet, since I haven't read the second book. As a stand alone book, I'm not sure if this is worth reading since it's so uneven, but if the next books are good, then it would be."
5,Great Preternatural Series,"I bought this book following the recommendation on Amazon's search page for a different vampire series. I've read several in the preternatural genre and now rate this as the best. Rachel is tough, likeable and quirky. Her roommate Ivy is a constant surprise, and the villain Trent promises to be a perfect foe. Kim Harrison has created a unique world that creates original traits, beliefs and powers in a genre that is often one duplicate after another."
4,Dead Witch Walking,Kim Harrison's Rachel Morgan is a wonderfull addition to theVampire Hunter Club. This book takes us back to when it wasfun to read Anita Blake(before all the sex got in the way of thestory.) Dead Witch Walking is a fun read. I realy enjoyed it. Itruly think others will like it too. there are several of us whohave read Kim Harrisons three Racheal books and are chomping at the bit for more!
1,Don't Buy It -- Borrow It If You Must Read It,"I found this book to be terribly written and incredibly unimaginative. If you want to read it, check it out from the library and save yourself some money."
3,Readable,"This was readable, though I found it was very easy to put aside to do other things. I would still recommend it and will most definitely pick up her next book - hopefully one that ties up some of the ends left lose in Dead Witch Walking."
4,NEW GENRE,"i picked this book up while waiting on my plane...after reading it, i was completely intrigued, but confused...I have a co-reader who suggested we go back and read book 1 and have been in love with this series ever since. Kim Harrison is a great author and story teller, I love how she makes me feel like i am living in the paranormal with Rachel. Every situation, person, job...etc, i compared to one in our ""human"" world... I fell in love with every character...If you enjoy great paranormal novels, not scary, you would love this series..."
4,Fun read,Loved Kim Harrison's style. Witty and funny! I could just read about Rachel Morgan doing the dishes. Great stuff and a solid way to begin this series.
5,BEST EVER!!!! ADDICTIVE!,THE ENTIRE SERIES IS OUTSTANDING! Main character kicks ass and gets hurt! Cool supporting characters... a little desire and sex!! Lots of amazing supernatural characters and how they mold within contemporary society!
4,Good Reading. Each one gets better,"Kim Harrison's books are little harder reading than some of the urban fantasy novels out there, but no less enjoyable. Each book is around 500 pages, so it takes a little more committment to get through than some others. I have read the entire series and I am completely hooked.Don't read these looking for romance, there isn't a whole lot, but there is a ton of sexual tension between Ivy and Rachel."
2,No desire to read the rest,"What a goody two shoes book. Usually I don't notice that kind of thing because most of the time in books, it's a pretty seemless affair depending on the audience and story but MAN this was so lame sometimes.The first half of the book was very boring, fortunately it picked up after the whole rat thing. Up until them the only interesting thing was the almost vampire lesbian instances. Too little too late though. I would probably never read the rest in the series. I didn't care for the supernatural world that was created, nothing left me wanting to know more about these characters."
3,good read,"I was ready not to like this book. But once I got into it I couldn't put it down. Its a good premise for a story and I like the main characters. The only problem I had was that she has ""living vampires"" in her story. That was almost enough for me to put the book down and stop reading it. But once I got past that part I found a rather enjoyable book where you want to read to the end to find out what happens to the characters."
2,"Good Idea, Great Title, Poorly Written","I really wanted to like this book, and went back to it a number of times, but my irritation with the writing outweighed any enjoyment I got. This is one of my favorite genres, but mainly because I love to be immersed in another reality. However the writing of this book is so amateurish that I was constantly jerked out of my immersion. I think that if a really good writer of this genre (Glen Cook, Fritz Leiber, James Blaylock, etc.) could have mentored the author, it might have had a chance."
3,Flawed but fun--I'll come back for a Sequel,"""Dead Witch Walking"" is a fun book to read. The structure is not very tightly woven, but the characters are endearing and the suspense is well-maintained. I enjoyed the main character, Rachel (a witch). Her vampire roommate Ivy and the family of pixies in the garden are also skillfully drawn. I can forgive a little sloppiness in plotting if the writer can create characters to care about. I'll come back for a sequel and hope that Kim Harrison improves with experienc."
1,Female Harry Dresden,"I cant believe Kim Harrison wasnt sued by Jim Butcher. This book is pretty much a carbon copy of Harry Dresden, but with a female lead character instead!Lets see now...Wizard investigator. Check.Finds clues from a faerie/pixie who loves honey. Check.Attacked by a demon. Check.Traps demon in a circle of magic. Check.Wise cracking main character. Check.Tough as nails partner like Ivy and Murphy. Check.There are literally tons more similarities between the two books.So while i did enjoy Dead Witch Walking somewhat, i cant give it any more stars because of how many ideas were stolen from Harry Dresden. So if you enjoyed this book then you MUST do yourself a favor and pick up the Dresden files by Jim Butcher."
3,Tongue in cheek...,"This book has gotten mixed reviews, and if I had read them first I probably would never have gotten the book. That being said, I enjoyed Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking. I found it's tongue in cheek style provided a refreshing, quick read. If you're after a dark vampire book, this probably isn't the one for you. Think of it along the guilty pleasure lines."
2,Maybe it's me...,"...but I really didn't get it. I wanted so badly to like this book because I'm mourning over the turn that the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series has taken. However, I just couldn't get into the book at all. It's not necessarily fair to expect something as good as the beginning of Hamilton's series, but I saw that many other Hamilton fans suggested this series as an alternative. I'll put my copy on e-bay and hope for the best."
3,Just average,"After reading the Sookie Stackhouse series, I was looking for another Vampire series and came across this one. The book is average, and after reading this one I will go no further in the series. While the characters are very interesting and have a lot to offer, the writing itself is amateurish and plot weak. It is very hard to connect with the characters or sense any chemistry among them because the book does not spend as much time on working the characters together. The humor is nothing to write home about. It amazes me at how easily Morgan (the heroine and witch) can get in and out of the villian's grounds. The book lacks a flow and cohesion in writing and plot. I was disappointed because the characters have a lot of potential, but the writing and plot do not do it justice. I would say avoid this book - its merely average, and I am sure there are better books out there."
4,Good/Bad opinion,"Well, lets see, I have mixed feelings about this first book. At the begining it was VERY slow. It was boring and I was lost because the author confused me with too much information, yet noe enough to explain what the heck was going on. I forced myself to read more and once I hit 200--something pages, it got interesting. I really wanted to give up but then it got better and better. At the beginging, I didn't even want to bother to read it, but after I finished it, I think I am curious to read the second book."
5,Great fun and everything I wanted in a modern fantasy,"This book was exactly what it needed to be: fun without being flippant, adventurous without being exhausting, and sexy without being crass. While the idea of magical creatures side by side with humans is hardly new, Harrison presents a few new twists and I found the world well thought out and richly and believably drawn. I actually looked at my tomatos askance today!I especially recommend this book to those who enjoy the world of Laurell K. Hamilton but find her books too raw. ""Dead Witch Walking"" strikes just the right balance: enough violence and sensuality to engross the reader without delving into buckets of gore. The pacing was excellent and the characters all extremely engaging.Fantastic book. I can't wait for the next installment."
4,Can't wait to read the next book!,I have never read any of Kim Harrison's books before and was quite surprised. She keeps you on your toes through each chapter...looking forward to the rest of the series!
3,Enjoyable .....,"I downloaded this book as it was a Kindle Freebie and I was keeping my expectations fairly low. It seems that Amazon offers a very mediocre book to boost sales for the author trying to entice people into buying additional books. This is the first book that I have downloaded in some time where I considered purchasing the next book in the series. I became engrossed in the characters and how a witch, vampire, pixies, and a human can coexist in harmony.Albeit - there were sections of the book where I felt additional detail would have been nice. I was hoping for mode details on ""the Turn"" but never got them. It seems that this would have been really interesting. In addition, I thought the author grazed over why certain drugs were considered illegal. The book was amusing and when I am looking for a new book, I will definitely consider the next book."
2,Should I give it the sixth chance?,"I started reading this book five times. I really tried. The characters were ok, but the amount of fantasy world explaining that the author has to do to introduce you into this world makes reading laborious and not really fun. After the fifth time I decided that I don't really have to struggle. I just want a fun fantasy read. Maybe if this book was in a movie form and some artists already put all the explanation into the visual, then I could get the story and not be stuck in trying to get the details. I read some review that said that the first chapter is too slow. Maybe I should give it a sixth chance? Start from the second chapter? I don't know. Meanwhile I am looking into the option of deleting it off my Kindle entirely."
4,A definite winner!!,"Well, I'm not finished with it yet but I'm very happy with her book so far. It's a free flowing style that's very comfortable and the characters are intriguing with a good sense of dialog. Plus she paints a wonderful backdrop of characters I can't wait to get more into the series."
5,Hang in there...it gets better,"When Rachel Morgan, a Inderland Security employee, decides to quit her job as a runner and go into business for herself, she finds herself on the wrong side of the law.I'll admit that I wasn't thrilled with the first few chapters of this book. I didn't care for the main character (too snarky) or the setting (way too complicated). However, by the third chapter, I was hooked. The hard-boiled detective voice of the novel won me. Rachel turned out to have a soft spot (several, actually), and her sidekick Jinx the pixie was one of my favorite characters.The book is pretty grim in spots, and Rachel takes her share of abuse at the hands of the bad guys, but she's tough and has plenty of back up to help her through. I enjoyed the fact that, although there was a bit of a romance, it didn't overpower the story. Also, there were plenty of action scenes that made me want to read on.I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,So So,"I would like to say I liked it... but i'm uncommitted. I think she has started some good characters, but this first book seems repetitive and a bit slow. I like the twists she's put on everyone else's fairies, elves, pixies, vampires, witches and such... but the main characters seem underdeveloped and the plot too skinny. I'm holding out for the second book. It was good enough that I'll invest the time in that second one, but stand alone... I'm not feelin the love for ole Rachael yet. And Ivy... not enough of her, although I'm interested. I would be more interested in the rat."
3,Not to bad,It was okay. It left a lot of questions which I'm not sure I missed anything in the reading. It's good though.
3,Very detailed,"I have read two of her books so far, I really want to love her books. I like the world she creates and I don't mind her over detailed writing. She describes every movement, every sandwich and her main character is always on edge on every page. I don't understand how this magical witch cannot do anything right, can't protect herself in any way. Where's her power? Where's her strength? She keeps getting beat up, and everyone sits around waiting to save her. She doesn't do much to warrant all this devotion from people she barely knows but they keep chasing after her day after day. I think this is a fun read if you don't think about things too much. I was disappointed at the lack of romance. This seems like a book for young boys with a female character as the lead, a lot of blood and guts with little substance or logic."
4,Better than average paranormal sic-fi character,"Really entertaining series with interesting developed characters. Sometimes the relationship with the main character and her room mate is a little weird,but if you continue to follow, it looks like the Author is laying a foundation.I love the action. Less graphic romance, and more sci-fi action is always better.This is a series worth downloading."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I this book after I read the second one, so I already knew certain things going in. But I still enjoyed it and I think that many other people will too. Rachel is a great character and I'm having a great time getting to know her. Jenks and Ivy and Nick and everyone are really interesting supporting characters (which isn't something you can always find)."
5,"A new author, with some fresh talent!","I just put the book down after finishing it. If you like the supernatural, this is a book for you. I'm sure you already know what it's about by what it says on Amazon, so I'll just state this is a wonderful new find. The characters have depth, the writting is funny, the plot is thick, the bad are flat out evil, and the good are a nice mix of good and bad. This book was really clever, and I'm pre-ordering the sequal right now through Amazon (The Good, the Bad, and the Undead). She makes for a great start to a six part series, leaving loose ends to keep you wanting more, and an individual plot for each book, but yet an on going plot that ties them all together. You will love and enjoy this book."
3,Entertaining,"This is an entertaining book and introduction into the series. There are quite a few grammatical mistakes that distract the reader though. I'm not sorry to have spent my time reading this book/series, but it's not a book I will be keeping for my collection."
4,Many Questions Unanswered,"I thought this book was wonderful. I'm a sucker for anything supernatural, but I was disappointed in how the book ended. There were so many questions I had left that were still unanswered. I know the book has continuing stories, but if you use the same character I think that each book in itself should have its own story and complete it within that book. I don't want to wait until the next book to find out if the questions were answered or not."
4,Super Reader,"This has one of the funniest concepts lurking in the background of anything I had read in a long time. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Literally. I can't believe she put that in there, as a tomato strain kills normal people, but not the supernatural types, of which the heroine is one.This can leave people deathly afraid of pizza sauce. Very amusing.This is solidly entertaining. Harrison manages to prevent a degeneration into 'girly romance', although that is definitely an element.An ex-government sponsored bounty hunter leaves her job, which may not be the greatest idea. She tries to set up on her own and navigate the world of vampires, withces, werewolves, and ex-managers with a grudge.A partnership with a cool female vamp and a few pixies helps out. Conflict with the supervillain of the piece doesn't."
4,Dead Witch Walking Review,"Dead Witch Walking keeps you spellbound from the very beginning. If you like witches, vampires and pixies, you'll love love this book! It has a lot of action, intrique and steamy sexual tension. With Jenks, her quirky but tough little pixie sidekick, she decides to quit her job at the I.S. and go it alone. There's just one problem -- you can't quit. You either pay off your contract or they put a contract out on you! She partners up with Ivy, a sexy vamp, who also worked for the I.S., and the fun -- and danger -- begins. I loved it."
4,Enjoyable,"I liked it. It didn't hold my attention rapt, but it was good.The fact that she kept her protagonist from being another mysteriously super-powered walking trope,like so many others was refreshing. I didn't care overmuch for the limitations of the magic system, but then... it does keep everything from blowing way out of proportion. Perhaps I merely wished for more variety in it? I bought the next one in the series after this.I have one major concern: bad editing. The book is rife with omission typos. What made them think that was ok?"
5,Great read and great series,"After reading the first Twilight book, I didn't think vampire, witch, ""otherworld"" books were for me but Kim Harrison proved me wrong. She develops the characters so fully, I felt they were real. I honestly missed them when the book was finished. I read the whole series and can't wait for more."
4,A fun read,"I enjoyed this book alot. It is fun and keeps you guessing. It is a great summer book. Not as dense, twisty and gripping as Butcher's Dresden series which I consider the best in the genre, but in the same arena. Love th mix of characters. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Jenks Rules!"
4,"Oh look, a review that doesn't reitterate the summary, or give spoilers!","I've read the book once before, and had bought this as a gift to my mother, who uses audio books. I loved the series, and this did nothing to dissapoint. The only note I'd like to mention is that the character voices attempted by the reader, Marguerite Gavin, are a little tough to get used to. That aside, the recording, and story are fantastic. I reccomend to any and all."
2,"Show, don't tell.","This story had an interesting premise, but unfortunately did not follow ""show, don't tell"". There was also way too much inner dialogue, which distracted from the flow of the read."
1,disappointed,"I love reading, just about anything, so when I pick up a bad book and can't return it, I'm definitely not happy about it, so I can't be nice with my review. I can't believe I spent $8.44 on this book; I'm forcing myself to read it just because I spent so much on it. I was fooled by it's 4 star rating, because I'm already on chapter 7 but it's so ridiculously boring, and there has yet to be an interesting plot to be revealed. The book seems to be struggling pretty badly with it's hidden cliched lines and desperate attempt at humor, and there are too much mundane details that make the book even more boring than it already is. Sorry to say, but the author's attempt at creating a fantasy world of the supernatural has failed to excite me in this book."
1,Can't believe this got published,"I don't know how the story ends. I couldn't finish this book (and I read 2-4 books a week). I got to chapter five and just couldn't take it anymore. There were so many editing problems with this book - so many sentences that just weren't sentences, so many hanging phrases - that I couldn't get past the gaping problems of poor editing. Kim owes me 8 bucks, and I want it back."
1,I wanted to like it,"Some books are hard to put down, this one was hard to pick up. I usually read a book this size and this same genre in one or two days, but it took me several weeks. When I finally made it to the end, I was totally let down. I felt there were a lot of questions left unanswered. I guess they want you to read the next book, but I will not."
2,Dead Witch Walking,"I read a lot of books, and when I started reading this after seeing all the books by this author, I was very disappointed and just ended up clearing it off of my Kindle after the first 2-3 chapters. Not worth investing my time."
2,Dead witch,"I heard this book on XM and had to purchase it for my Kindle. It was so-so, it kind of read like a teen book."
4,The mink book,"In honor of her new book ""White Witch, Black Curse"" I've been going back and re-reading her other titles.This is the mink book, where she meets Nick. Love the vampire dating guide.Not the best book in the series but certainly a very good start!"
4,"Slow start, but finally got going...","It took me about half the book to really get invested in the story, but once I did, I ended up enjoying it. The author made up for the slow beginning by building a unique world, with an interesting plot and quirky characters. I enjoyed the way she slowly built the relationships and trust between the characters (although I still don't understand Rachel's and Ivy's relationship as much as I do the others... hopefully that'll become clearer in the next book). Overall, a good beginning. I'm looking forward to the next in the series since the author seemed to hit her stride."
4,we need more,"The reviewer had it right on this one, it is anita blake meets stephanie plum. The writing was good and the story line kept you guessing leaving at the end just enough questions for me to be biting my nails until the next book comes out to see what happens, but doesn't leave any big cliff hangers.... its a great book and perfect to help fill the time between laurell k hamilton novels."
1,"Snore, bore, bad","I have tried to read this book three different times, oh it is boring, as much as i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt I want to pull my hair out. Bla bla bla... She is stuck in a cage. bla bla bla. she has a problem with her vamp room mate, bla bla bla. I'll return all these books they are so bad.. so boring so amazingly snore."
2,Not PC,"Couldn't get past the first few pages after I saw the author described Ivy as ""Oriental."" Hello? This is the 21st century. Things are oriental, but people are Asian. I wanted badly to go on, esp. when Charlaine Harris, a favorite author, said she liked this book. But for a southerner, obviously Ms. Harris has more class and respect for other cultures as illustrated through her characters, than Ms. Harrison."
4,Fantastical and fun!,"Really imaginative and creating the groundwork of some really interesting characters. Unfortunately I cannot give the book five stars because the ending was rather weak and useless - in a word anticlimactic. After a great romp and introduction of some excitingly horrible villains, the end was sort of a poof=up in smoke meltdown. I look forward to seeing what Harrison does with the rest of the series."
5,Hooked after 3 pages,I have read the entire series. This has now become the model for which I compare all other Urban Fantasy novels. Amazing series.
4,Dead witch walking,Very well thought out book. I love Jenks. Can't wait to read the next one. I hope it's as good as the first one.
2,Giving it a Go,"Upon the recommendation of a new friend, I am giving this series a try. I love to keep a smattering of novels produced by writers like Charlaine Harris, Janet Evanovich, or Lisa Lutz. They prevent my reading list from getting too serious! While this novel certainly fits that express requirement, it didn't regale me with, well, anything really. It wasn't particularly funny, exciting, well-written, or clever. I finished it without forcing my way through it but I didn't log right on to buy the second installment of the series. I am going to try one more and if nothing registers by then I'll move on to funnier vampires and clumsier detectives :0)."
4,If you love suspense then this is a must read.,"Keeps you in suspense, can't wait to read the second book in the series. Kim Harrison really keeps you guessing."
4,P. Cooper,Oxford's Phrase and Fable is helpful to writers. Some of the phrases are familiar from my childhood; my mother was full of phrases and anecdotes. This book sprouts memories that are still alive.
3,You will need the associated Clifford Books,"When I was searching online for some books for my 3 year old, I found this one and thought it would be great since it included 15 Clifford books and some associated activities. No where in the item description did it say this was solely a teacher's guide and did not include the Clifford stories. When you ""look inside the pages"" and see the table of contents it lists each Clifford book and nothing else. This really lead me to believe that all 15 books were contained within. This is not the case. I am sure the activity book is great, but without the associated stories it is useless to me and my 3 year old. I hope this helps dispel some of the confusion and prevents others from making my mistake."
3,Ok doc,"Decent enough documentary on the ""Relapse"" tour but I think 20 years later they need to do an overview. There was a lot of interesting stuff that happened on that tour that they didn't get on film, but I did like how they showed the craziness of the tour (but nothing compared to the band from 86-91) balanced out with what they were up to 6 months after the tour was over.There is a LOT more footage, and this as well as ""Gift"" (still not on DVD) disappoint because there's obviously full length shows that have been shot over the years.With the recent full band reunion for an award show, it's time to showcase their importance and influence in modern rock.This tells a tiny part of the story. As a Janes fan it's far from the complete story and captures a small part of how they were as a live band.It get the ""travelling circus"" part down and some personal insight from Dave and Perry."
2,Hugely Disappointing..........,Well well well......maybe its just that I have never had the chance to experience a JA gig in the flesh that I was relying so heavily on this DVD to give me something of the sheer umimaginable ......but I can't for the love of ????? find a lot to praise it. the rare moments of musicality which any fan craves in something like this are edited in such a way to make you furious....I mean come on WE WANT TO HEAR THE WHOLE SONG !!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T STOP IN THE MIDDLE AND WANDER OFF SOMEPLACE ELSE ..... JESUS CHRIST !!!!!!! and the documentary style .....it all smacks of amateur .....
4,Jane's Addiction - 'Three Days' (Sanctuary) 4 1/2 stars,"Concert took place at the Hammersmith Ballroom in New York, New York on October 31, 1997. Maybe best described as a docu-drama. Don't get me wrong, for this 'Three Days' DVD is still great for all (most, anyway) true Jane's Addiction fans. You get ninety-six minutes of the band's 1997 - what they called a 'Relapse Tour' - as I distinctly remember Perry Farrell insisting that it was NOT a reunion tour - but a relapse tour. Nice hearing and seeing Jane's classics come to life on gems like ""Ocean Size"", ""Three Days"", the awesome (futuristic-like) ""Pigs In Zen"", the (always) beautifully-played ""Jane Says"" among others. Plus, there's forty minutes worth of out-takes, fan bull s***, etc. - that, I personally didn't get all that much out of. A must-have."
5,Hind's Feet on High Places/Devotional,This is an excellent book for someone who is dealing with fears. It also is an excellent book for learning to trust and lean upon God. It will challenge you to look at your own real-life situation and see where you are falling short! I recommend this book for the fearful and those who have difficulty trusting in God!
5,Awe-Inspiring,"This book takes the spiritually driven person on a journey towards becoming a servant of the Kingdom of Heaven. Hunard's allegory brings its reader face to face with personal faults and failings, but follows up with the healing love of the Shepard, Jesus Christ. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a new life in Christ! This book in particular if you enjoy writing in your books. =-)"
4,worth while,I bought this book as we are reading it in our book club. This is not something I would normally select. I am pleasently surprised how this book reaches out to you no matter what circumstances you are going through. I will be keeping this book in my home library as I feel it is a reread during different stages of your life. I feel it will speak to you differently each time you read it.
4,Excellent expression of the love of God!,"This book is amazing. I can really identify with Much Afraid and how she sees the Shepherd. I too am 'much afraid'. I have been truly blessed by this story and the devotions on each page. I would guess that this book was written just for me! I am blessed more and more, the more I read of it and to know the wonderful love God has for me."
5,A must read!!!,The foundational truths in this book are perfectly presented in this allegory. This book is ideal for the new believer or one that just simply needs to be refreshed by the simplicity of trusting in The Good Shepherd.Love it....a lot!
4,As good as thrillers get,"Readers who want texture, excitement, and literary quality in their escape novels will have to look long and hard to find a writer who can deliver more than Furst. As a life long (40 years plus) student of the West on the eve of World War Two, I can state his history of the period is letter perfect"
3,Strategy and drama all together,"Furst does a fine job of combining real world strategy concerns from WWII with romance, intrigue and covert special operations set against the backdrop of the Balkans and south eastern Europe where betrayal is the norm. If you are not familar with the concerns of the Romanian oil fields in WWII, this may be a little tough to read and understand, but if you have a CHurchill-ian outlook, this is a great read."
3,I Guess Even Furst is Entitled to Mediocre Book,"I'm a die-hard Furst fan, but this book is simply an average read. As others have noted, there is little suspense or plot here. As always, Furst's characters and plot locations are compelling, but I kept turning the pages wondering when this book was going to take off. And finally, the book had ended. Well, even an average Furst book is better than many authors' best works, so I'll give him three stars for effort."
3,Is Furst Running Out Of Petrol?,"I have enjoyed reading Alan Furst's novels for quite a while now, but Blood of Victory seems a bit too contrived and lacking in psychological depth. This book, in fact, seems to be more of a screenplay than a novel, and I could even imagine the late David Niven - a la Guns of Navarone - playing the book's chief protagonist Serebin. Nazis, shootouts on river barges, military coups - with Niven no longer with us, perhaps we could talk Robert Redford into playing the part. Blood of Victory is not one of Furst's best."
4,"Not Furst's best, but still a lot to recommend it","Atmosphere. Plot. Character. All are there. I liked this book, but not as much as some of the other Furst novels. Start with some of the earlier ones. Then try this one."
2,My first Furst book: hope the second is better,"This is the first Furst book I have read. He has a lot of fans, and many acknowledge in these reviews that it is not his best book. I hope it is his worst, and so I will give him a second chance. The positive element in the book is the detailed historical setting. The characters, plot and much of the writing are weak. Unlike more literary authors, like John Le Carre, Furst attempts to give his characters substance by making them as exotic as possible. Thus Serebin and the rest are sophisticated caricatures, not people. This is good in airport paperbacks, but sits uneasily with the thoroughly intellectual tone of the novel. Hope for better next time."
3,OK - but weak plot and characters,"I read the author's ""Polish Officer"" about 3 years ago and remembered it as very good, so when this came into view I grabbed it with delight - but unfortunately, it's neither very good nor a delight. It's mediocre. Both Graham Greene and Eric Ambler write low-key spy novels, but they really excel in character development. Furst seems to be a stickler for historical, cultural and political details but misses in the character area - the author should be able to show/tell me why these people are willing do what they're doing. It's not there."
3,Good Thriller,"This is the most recent espionage novel from Alan Furst. Set in WWII, it concerns the efforts of British Intelligence to impede the flow of Rumanian oil into Germany. As with all of Furst's books, the quality of writing is good, the plot interesting, and his attention to period detail is excellent. This book is clearly superior to most thrillers. Despite these positive features, this book has a major shortcoming. Furst seems to be writing the same book over and over again. The plots and central characters of his books are all relatively similar. It is not fair to say that if you've read one, you've read them all but the repetitive elements are becoming stale."
2,Blood of Victory is pretty anemic.,"I have read all of Alan Furst's books earlier books in order, and usually within a day! I can't finish this one: the characters lack personality, the plot is impenetrable and I found myself just plain bored with it. I was VERY disappointed. I sure hope Furst isn't running out of steam. His other books (especially the two with the French movie maker) are the very best books in the espionage genre I've ever read. Let's hope this book is just a bump in the road."
3,Blood of Victory,"I don't read these books, but my dad sure seemed excited. He is a Tom Clancy fan and has read all of his books. This author had good reviews so I gave him a shot"
1,The worst one from A.Furst,"I do like A.Furst novels, but this one should be avoided. The main character is completely unbelievable, there are tons of errors in historic environment, and the story is unbelievable too. In addition to this it is boring and predictable."
2,Pretty Thin Stuff,"I really wanted to like this book and this writer. After all he is prolific, with many more books in the same vein. But, alas, it was not to be. This is pretty thin gruel. Yes it is heavily atmospheric, but it is also superficial, contrived and predictible. Hungarian counts, delicate, seductive, married French women with understanding husbands; exotic locations such as Istanbul and Odessa; lots of journeys by train and freighter. It all merges together into one dark, over-written rainy night. I longed for the sun to rise and put an end to it all. I closed the book for good around page 100 because I could not get myself to care about what might happen next."
2,Slow Running Blood,"This was not my kind of WWII novel.Very, very slow paced and somewhat disjointed.The final blow was that it just ended without any fanfare or flourish or reason."
4,Another Alan Furst victory,"Even though I love Alan Furst's books, I had not bought Blood of Victory because of its bad reviews on Amazon.This was a big mistake, since nobody writes books like Alan Furst.If you like Alan Furst, you will like this book and all his other books. It may not be your favorite Alan Furst, but as usual it's a great story with great details about its setting and in depth historical information about the lead up to WWII."
2,Not the best of Furst,"This was the first Furst novel I read. I was disappointed with the characters and the plot that never really captured my interest. I got to the end of the book and found that I didn't care at all what happened to the characters or the outcome of the plot. Not a good sign for a novel.The characterization felt very shallow and it was difficult to get into the book.I am now reading ""Night Soldiers"" and am loving it--so don't judge Furst solely by ""Blood of Victory"" if you don't like it either."
1,I couldn't finish the novel!,"From reading the other reviews on Amazon, it seems you either love or hate this novel. I'm falling on the disappointed side. I was hoping for a novel similar to what W. Somerset Maugham would write. Instead, this novel turned out to be painfully s-l-o-w and boring. After reading half the novel, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to bail out. I can't remember the last time that I quit a novel because it was so unreadable. It's apparant that Alan Furst is no W. Somerset Maugham."
2,Blood of Boredom,"i struggled to get past the first 150 pages of this pile of words. too bad the thing only runs 270 pages or so, because alan furst has become a first-rate cure for insomnia."
5,My feedback,I think that this CD is very relaxing and easy listening and I will be looking for more of the same type of music.
1,not krips,This recording is not under the direction of Josef Krips. He never led the soloists. Omega has released a fake.
4,Contemporary Issues in Counseling,This book was sent fast and came in great shape. The seller correctly described it. So far this book has been helpful in my class.
1,wasted my money,"I thought I was going to like this headset. I didn't even mind paying this much, with it being SHURE and all... However, turns out this wasn't such a sure thing. Most of the time people can't hear me. Even when I adjust the mic location. I thought maybe I just got a defective one.... Most everyone else seems to like it."
3,i'm the best,"this cd isn't all that bad. they released it without even being a year old as a band. the best tracks are probably 1 and 4, tonight's the night and two. also, the hidden track. yep. if i get caught reviewing this cd they're gonna make fun of me.overall its so so. the new cd is better obviously."
5,Punk rock with a local sound,"I first became familiar with Nevergonnascore because two of it's members graduated from my Glendale high school last year. I love their CD, and they're great live, too. Quite popular in my neighborhood obviously, but I'd recommend the CD to anyone who's looking for punk rock with a local sound."
2,What's wrong with you people?,"This has gotta be one of the worst punk bands I've ever seen. In fact, I think they disgrace the Phoenix punk scene. You want reasons: 1. A band should have talent, right? None of that here. 2. Good bands should write good songs. The lyrics, harmonies, and musicianship is among the worst I've ever heard. 3. The name speaks for itself. 4. Sorry guys, I've had the unpleasurable experience of seeing you guys open for real bands twice already, and I'm afraid to say that you should start doing something else before you embarass yourselves too much."
5,too bad nobody's heard this band,"this album KILLS. i can't really think of anything to compare it to, but if you've heard early karma to burn (when there was vocals) this is kind of like that but heavier. i recommend this album to anyone who is into the whole stoner scene but generally only if you are a fan of sludgier bands like noothgrush (this isn't nearly that slow), mugwart, or rebreather. mugwart is the closest thing. ANYWAY, this is a real heavy album and i guess it's just a solid rock record so check it out."
4,Good replacement for a low price,"Nice top, comes with the straps for the rear support. Due to the fact that is made for samurais sold till 94, it doesn't fits quite perfectly on my 97 model, but it was that or getting soaked when it rains. The back zipper also could be of a better quality."
4,"Good Timing, Normal Product","The knives arrived at the right time. There was a nice box and a cover leather. However, the knives were not sharp, so you have to buy some sharpeners and sharp it before use."
1,They should look before they ship...,"Two days ago I received an order, through Amazon,from BUDK Worldwide.It was a triple set of Hibben's throwing knives.I opened the package, to find the leather sheath hadmildew growing all over it.As far as the knives, I wasn't satisfied with them,as there was no edge to be found, anywhere on the blade.Even the tips were very dull.I would have returned the knives just for this reason.I can't imagine what target medium these were designed for."
3,"Not bad, could use some work","They shipped fairly quickly and seem well balanced, they are extremely dull, dull enough that a whetstone will do little to sharpen them, i would use a grinder or belt sander if i had one but i think i am just going to get them professionally sharpened, the sheath is great just a bit tight with all three knives stuffed inside, i guess that after you break it in it will be fine"
5,Great throwing knives,"I purchase these after being familiar with Gil Hibben knives and their quality. I was not dissapionted when I got them. They were not too sharp on the edges which lends them to throwing by the blade or handle, but they do have a sharp and durable tip. the case is nice too. Easy to spin throw or no-spin throw. Very pleased with the price from United Cutlery and Amazon."
5,The Greatest!!!!,"I do not like to read, and was forced to read this book by my professor. Thank God he did, because it is the most amazing thing that I have ever read or will!!!This book took over my life! Do yourself a favor, read this book!!!Great, especially for guys!"
4,Morning river,"Morning River was a little slow and difficult to get into from the beginning. By the time the main character got to St. Louis the story line began to pick up. By the end of the book, I had trouble putting it down."
5,The Moring River,"Michael Gear's Indians, Mountain men, entrepreneurs, and even effete New Englanders ring of faithful to their time and place. This is not only a good story with finely etched characters, but good history as well"
3,Good,"A fairly good overview of Kay Starr's RCA singles circa 1955-1959. Hits and misses intermingle with unreleased cuts to produce an interesting, though un-even collection that demonstrates how a truly great jazz singer contended with the more commercial sounds of the mid-50's. Contains the original hit version of ""Rock And Roll Waltz"", and a previously unreleased ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"". This disc will be great for a fan, but better choices can be found for a first-time listener."
3,NOT the Lisa Kelly of Celtic Woman!,Not Lisa Kelly of Celtic Woman. Definitely NOT the Lisa Kelly of Celtic Woman!!!
2,Lisa Kelly review,Lisa has a great voice but it is hard to hear her sing because the instruments and back up vocals over power hers. The songs are quite originnal but it is hard to find any that grab your attention over and over again. I don't recommend this CD by Lisa Kelly.
4,This is great,"I recommend this book for anyone feeling down on themselves, or just in love with the idea of love. It's a story of two people who fall in love despite of their outward appearances. It focuses on true beauty, inner beauty, and the fact that love conquers all. I think teenage people especially should read this, as teen years are an awkward time. Besides, I've known the author of this book for 16 years, and I think she's beautiful. Way to go girl. I'm looking forward to more."
4,Beautifully written and moving.,"I had never picked up a Tanya Huff before.. or at least I had never picked one up and taken it home. I am always wary of authors I haven't experienced, and her other books, such as Sing the Four Quarters, didn't appeal enough to my spontanious side. However, this time I was lucky enough that the cover art (by Yvonne Gilbert) appealed to that side of me. I picked up the book last week and was not disappointed. The characters feel wonderfully realistic, and Huff did not forget that the heroine of the story was also a 17 year old girl, and had her act accordingly. Other characters were also realistically varied; some made me frustrated, others made me laugh, some even made my eyes tear. All in all, this book is wonderful and definitely worth the shipping and handling."
3,This is a reprint edition.,"Fans of Tanya Huff should know that she has not, in Wizard of the Grove, come out with a new book in her Crystal series. This is a reprint edition with the original two books, Child of the Grove and The Last Wizard, combined in a new cover.I haven't found this series to be as interesting or well-written as either her Blood series or the last two books of the Four Quarters series."
2,Maybe two stars is too many,"I found this book, or these two books to be very poorly written. There is no depth to these stories. At one point the heroine stumbles into a cabin in the middle of the woods and eats for two days straight. Where did the food come from?The characters in this book seem completely unphased by the totally unbelievable things that happen to them. Character development is below average and each event seems like a bridge from one lifleless coincindence to the next.Oh, and the endings are boring... . For good fantasy of the female genre try JV Jones."
5,Excellent Fantasy,"I found this book wonderful. I read it in three hours, and it was worth every second. I believe a few of the characters are under-developed, while most are well characterized. Most of the plot is understandable, although a few parts were hard to follow. This is one of my two favorite books."
3,"A good book, but slightly marred","Overall, I did like this book, once it got going, but getting it going was a major problem. This book would be significantly improved if the first six chapter's were excised. We really don't need to be told the story of the main character's creation right away, especially not when that story goes back several generations.Other than that, the characters are interesting, the plot is exciting, and the writing is good. Though, the ending is a little confusing."
5,Wizard Of the Grove,"I read this book when I was in 8th grade. It did start out with a slow pace, but I found that the background of the whole story was necessary, for it gave the reader a way to feel more for the main character, Crystal. I loved the ending because she ended up in Lord Death's arms. I just didn't particularly like her being in love with Raulin beforehand. The book did, however, leave me with wanting more, not less...I felt a little unsatisfied."
5,I have enjoyed this recording for about 15 years,"I remember the moment I got the boxed set of vinyl records and put the side one of the first record on the turntable. I was a teenager and it was a magical moment on christmas day.I admired everything from the cover of the box to gig pictures on the booklet of the boxed set. But the music - that was unearthly - I guess there wasn't a day when I didn't listen to at least one song from these records.Time of the turntables has passed, but I am happy this CD set has turned up. Again I can enjoy those magical moments with deeply touching music and great performances."
4,why are there two of these on amazon???,"there are two versions of this collection on amazon. this one and another one that costs about 8 bucks less. does anyone know what the difference is? is this more expensive a re-mastered version? i'll gladly pay 8 bucks if that was the case, but i need to know.anyone with the knowledge please enlighten me. thanks."
3,Disc 1 is the best of the 3,"After the ""Darkness"" album, Bruce's work fell off for me. ""The River"" seemed redundant and ""Nebraska's"" minimilism was unengaging. The reason I bring this up is that discs 2 and 3 have too many of his songs from that era for me to want to listen to them. Disc 1 is the original Springsteen and you should buy the collection for just for the first 2 songs.If you want to listen to one of the sweetest love songs ever, listen to the paired down rendition of ""Thunder Road"" If you want to listen to one of the hardest rocking songs EVER, listen to ""Adam Raised a Cain"". All the other songs are icing on the cake."
3,Time for a reassessment.,"I like Bruce and I like portions of this release. I just saw him and the E Street Band in concert and it one of the most exhilarating (and loud)experiences in recent memory. I hope that he releases a CD of the current tour as it would show Bruce in a updated light; one with an expanded appetite to incorporate americana folk and even a little country into the repertoire, not just as a novelty item.However, the most startling songs were the covers and previously unreleased songs, both at the recent concert (ex. The Who's My Generation) and on this CD. I do not know why, but one cannot download any song from this release as a mp3. Why is that? Other titles are available for download but not this one. Why? After 23 years of being in exisitence, the sheen has worn off the album and the gems should be made available for the individual songs. Why can't they be, here?"
4,Good...relatively speaking,"This is a great live set for what it is....could it be better? Of course. This set scratches only the surface of Bruce's legendary live performances and is a bit heavy on the stadium performances. There could have been a lot more from the early days before 1978 (including a great acoustic set he performed at WBCN in Boston).For any other artist, this would be a fantastic set. For Bruce Springsteen, I must say that I wanted more.One last thing, buy the square boxed edition, not the slip case or the rectangular box. The booklet is better."
5,Next Best Thing To Seeing Him Live,"This box set is awesome!! Seeing Springsteen live comes close to a religous experience. While many reviewers here say this set doesn't to him justice it's hard to capture all the energy and excitement of a live show on disc but this comes close. Disc 2 is probably my favorite of the three. ""Nebraska"" and ""Reason To Live"" come across really well on here. Well worth the price."
5,B-r-u-u-u-u-u-ce,"This is a justifiably well-regarded collection the covers a classic period of his career. Front to back, it's first-class work."
4,Forget the Hype and LISTEN!,"Few records in the history of the music industry have been as hyped as this one. Bruce was the reigning king of American rock in the mid-1980s, and this album hit the market with the force of the head-on collision Bruce roars about in ""Badlands."" That and several other selections on this set (""Born To Run,"" ""Racing In The Street,"" ""The River,"" ""Reason To Believe"") surpass the original recorded versions, while others don't quite make it (""Hungry Heart,"" ""Born In The U.S.A.,"" ""Cover Me""), and still others sound like carbon copies of their live-in-the-studio counterparts (the rest of the ""Born In The U.S.A."" selections). More than a decade after all the hype and the hoopla, the album holds up amazing well, but that should be no surprise coming from Bruce and the redoubtable E Street Band."
4,To each his his own....,"Personally, I think this is a pretty good live album for Bruce to release. In a way, it is a story, chronicling Bruce and the E Street Band's jump from performing in small, indoor venues to big, open-air arenas. Within this chronicle, you get the ballads, the rockers, the booze-and-party anthems, and (much to my own delight) you get some acoustic numbers as well.Some reviewers were dissapointed by the song-selection. And yet, in regards to Bruce-philes, the term ""to each his own"" definetely applies.Me, personally, though, I love it!"
1,"Lousy then, lousy now","This live compilation was a big disappointment (and pricey!) when it came out in 1986. Bruce went way downhill from The River on (Cadillac Ranch, anyone??), and this compilation album has way too much of that material. Where are the classic early live epics like New York City Serenade, Jungleland, and especially his live masterpiece Kitty's Back?? If you want good live Bruce, get Hammersmith Odeon, London '75 or find a bootleg of the 1978 tour (like the Capitol Theatre, NJ show).I thought this compilation was lame back in '86, and it certainly hasn't improved with time."
3,jersey girl was listed in the review and that was the only song I really wanted.,"Explanation of the cd mentions jersey girl so I think it is on the cd, which is the song I wanted. Very upset and disappointed when I rfeceived it and it waSN'T EVEN ON THERE."
1,NO WORDS !,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE.MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON !
4,"It's Live, but I prefer his studio albums better","This is a good addition to your music collection if you already have the studio albums but I have to admit I like the studio work better. You just can't improve on ""Born to run"", ""The River"" and Born in the USA"" CDs."
5,"Say,that's a nice knife...",I bought this to replace the same item I bought 5 years ago. If you had problems with pinback locking knives this is a good alternative. A solid piece of metal supports this folding blade. Increadably sharp out of the box and resasonably priced. This is my favorite knife!
3,"OK pocketknife, fits good.","Imported, made in China. Frame lock works good, blade sharp out of the box, but hard to keep a sharp edge on it. Lightweight so you won't feel it in your pocket and big enough for most tasks that a pocketknife is suited for. My recommendation, wait for it to go on sale."
3,A nice photobiography,"I mainly bought this for genealogy research and my interest in genealogical forcensics, specifically regarding old photographs. This is a nice, easy to read, photobiography that provides basic background on a mythic female figure of the American West. I would have liked to have known her."
5,Annie,The book is full of pictures and is great for kids to learn about our past and the legend of Annie Oakley.
4,"Practical, Simple, Helpful","Although my ""self-absorbed relative has passed away, this book gave me an in depth understanding of the self-absorbed person's modis operandi and creates practical solutions to make the experience less traumatic even after the fact. I was able to be more forgiving and understanding to both the parent and myself and feel compassion for both of us. I recommend this book to anyone who had an overbearing, controlling and unconscious parent to help liberate you from the complicated maze of thoughts, feelings and emotions that may be holding you back from your own self expression and freedom."
4,You know who you are,"If you had a narcisstic parent, you already know a lot about the topic, probably because you had years of therapy. I read this book and then passed it around from friend to friend. It made us all feel validated and comforted. The most usual aspect was to see the effects on ourselves, (in a admittedly sketchy way) and why we interact as we do with other people. It also helped me see why my own children sometimes back off. It's definitely worth reading for the validation. By the way, there is a wonderful review already posted by ""Sister Renee"" which is worth reading for its own merits."
2,"Decent, but it needs to be supplimented","This book has some good concepts, but I would recommend supplementing it with another book. Tends to repeat itself and isn't as clear as other books on the subject. I would recommend The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment, by Pressman & Pressman (1994)."
5,A Must Read,"Anyone who has grown up with a narcissistic parent should read this book. It' full of information, self-tests, projects and solid strategies to help you deal with interactions with your parent, as well as healing yourself. You certainly don't have to have a degree in psychology to understand and apply what is being said. This book is very reader friendly for the lay-person. I was told if there was only one book you could read about narcissistic parents, this would be it. After reading it, I have to agree."
3,Narcissim: Unlearning coping behaviours,"Helpful book, but the scope of describing the narcissistic parent may be too narrow. It focuses more on those parents/caregivers who are on the right side of the bell curve (extremes). Those more toward the midlle may have caused as much harm, but be less obvious to the reader.It also assumes that the parent figure is still operating from a narcissitic vantage point. Parents can & do grow and learn from mistakes; they may have been narcissistic to some degree in a child's formative years and moved beyond those traits. As adult children, our parents may even be more emotionally and psychologically immature than the ""child.""The book provides helpful exercises for adult children. More emphasis could have been placed on the adult child's need to focus on behaviours & responses to past messages which were part of their coping mechanisms and less on the past fault of somone who cannot be changed."
5,"Excellent guide, very easy to follow and understand","This book was very easy to read, follow and apply. I would , without question, recommend it to all who have narcissistic parents !"
1,poorly written,"In my opinion, this was frustrating. It seemed like it was written in such a way that you could not come away with workable ideas. I found it to be confusing. I loved the ""Wizard of Oz and other Narcissists.I think that it would be a better buy for someone."
2,Who's the narcissist?,I found this book poorly written and poorly edited (many typographical errors). Some of the suggestions/recommendations were childish in the extreme. There were a few (very few) nuggets of information but generally I felt like I was wasting my time. Too much of the book was spent on unhelpful generalizations about problem parents and techniques to control and/or manage parental behavior. The title led me to believe that the content would focus more on managing onself and establishing other satisfying relationships. I think Dr. Brown may still be too absorbed in the self-absorbed parents she writes about!
2,There's NO excuse for such a poorly written book,"If psychologist Nina Brown is not exactly on speaking terms with Standard English, then New Harbinger Books should get its editorial staff off its collective backside to make authors look like they've completed high school ... at the very least. Brown offers some valuable insight into the narcissistic personality but unfortunately, readers must sift through pages of poor writing (awkward phrasing, ghastly grammar, and and an utter lack of attention to a logical sequence of problems, examples, and explanations) to find it.This book MAY seem like it's well written to those who are familiar only with the most colloquial levels of speech and writing, but experts -- especially Ph.Ds -- owe their general readership much more."
4,A big help!,"This book was recommended to me by my therapist after realzing that members of my family have this disorder-- and also that as a result I, too, display characteristics of it. It gave me tremendous insight to the causes of this behavior and constructive ways to deal with it. Also to understand what behaviors are acceptable and healthy and which ones are not-- something I was greatly confused about! I highly recommend it!"
5,Extremely eye opening.,"If you've had a selfish and or destructive parent, this book is for you! I read the whole book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down, and I was in total agreement during the entire read.You will most likely experience several 'lightbulb moments' with this book. I cannot recommend it enough."
3,Informative,Good to detect and recognize pattern from your parent(s) and thus explaining why you might react and act in a certain way when you grow older.Many excersises to do that I opted out. Now at least I understand that I was right and my parent was wrong. It wasnt me that was wrng and that is the most important lesson for me to learn from ths book.
2,Lacking depth,"I was disappointed in this book. It lacked depth in the sense of helping those of us with narcisstic parents understand how it affects us in our current lives in order to understand ourselves better. It has a variety of ""exercises"" to overcome and deal with narcissistic parents but again, does not explore the intrapsychic affects of living with this type person."
3,Author advised that you endure the punishment,"This book advocates that the adult child put up with the abuse because the adult will never recognize their own narcissistic and abusive behavior. Since they are unable to change, the best we can do is adapt and change to accomodate their abuse. Poo on that! I got this book five years ago and following these guidelines simply enabled another lost 5 years of my life. No one should have to put up with such abuse. Ever. There must be a better solution - LEAVE!"
4,Big sounds from the big box,"A great cd! Man and acoustic bass (period) It is a regular listen of mine, and I figured I'd check out whether he'd done any others. It is a great sounding cd, filled with dynamic energy and panache. The range of sound that comes out of his fiddle is a joyous surprise. It will give you a new perspective on the possible range of emotion that can be accomplished with the bass, both plucked and bowed. A tasty treat."
5,"Amazing CD, get it","This is an amazing CD. Took a group of kids from our church to the concert and bought the CD then, been listening to it ever since. Wonderful group and fabulous songs. I could listen to this year round!"
5,Mercy Me,I bought this CD because my Granddaughter loves - their version of Silent Night- then I got hooked and play it over and over
5,"Great Songs, Great Arrangements","This is probably my favorite Mercy Me CD. If you have heard it, you know why. It expertly blends wonderful Christmas tunes with Mercy Me's power pop sound, and occasionaly it crosses into rock-opera.If you don't have the CD you are missing out. Happy Holidays."
4,Great Cd and...,"You can't help but enjoy the songs of Mercy Me, and especially when Bart and crew are singing some of the most nostagic songs out there. Josephs Lullaby is awesome by the way. A great companion Cd with this one is Jami Smith's new Christmas Album, you can find it on her website. Merry Christmas."
5,Traditional songs in an untraditional way,"MercyMe does a nice job making traditional Christmas songs come alive by making them more modern day sounding. For the traditionalists among us let me reassure you that they've not changed the overall sound and meaning of the songs, they've instead made them more upbeat. While they've added very little overall to the songs, they've made them their own by using the musical instruments of today (electric guitar etc..) and adapting it to fit their style. I, like many people out there, worked at a mall in my late teens and early twenties so I got so fed up with Christmas music that it took well over 10 years before I could listen to it again. This cd is a Christmas cd that's different so if you know someone that is sick of hearing Christmas music pick it up and put it in as a nice compromise! :-)"
5,This is a great cd:,"Very good cd, but then again all of Mercyme cd's are absolutely great andeveryone should have them all, hope you will buy one."
3,not exactly my cup of tea,it was ok but I prefer the typical old- fashioned carols. these guys put a new twist on the oldies which may interest a new generation
4,mercy me - christmas cd,Really enjoyed this Christmas CD. Good upbeat contemporary renditions of some well loved Christmas songs.
3,Some new stuff too,"If you like Mercy Me, you'll enjoy their take on the Christmas album. It's not just the same old songs."
5,Cool CD for this Christmas Season,"Next to Avalon, this group is also good to listen to. I've heard samples from this album on thier website, and will be buying it this holiday season!"
4,Good performance,"The singing style is rude and crude in some extent. The recording style is somewhat old-fashioned; on-mic with the large diaphragm microphones, maybe. But these 'faults' contribute to present powerfulness and exoticism that the work has intrinsically. There is another recording of Brahms' Zigeunerlieder available from CHANDOS. If you like nowadays beautiful chorus, you would prefer that one."
2,Not good value,"It's hard to recommend this issue. The performances are nothing special, the texts are in German only - and this full-price CD contains less than 43 minutes of music."
2,Not Fado,"This is a good easy-listening CD (see Carol King, Diane Krall, et al.), but it's not Fado, a word which has many meanings, but is unarguably soul-full, not soulful."
3,Microsoft Office 2003 All in One,"This is a very good book for the just past novice user. It presents clear instructions for exploring some of the bells and whistles that can make you more productive, but you may not know exist. I was disappointed, however, that it did not cover more advanced items such as macros."
1,"If you know Office, don't buy this book","My title of this review says it all. I am a self taught user of Office, primarily EXCEL,WORD and Publisher. I bought this book to refine my skills on these and to learn more about PowerPoint and Access. It starts out with basics on what's new, common feature, the speech feature, Customizing; Web intregration; Faxing and email. Then it goes to migrating to Office 2003. This is the first 14 Chapters. The rest of the book is the basics. How to start the Application, how to enter and ecit data. I wanted to learn about Equation Editor. Not in the index of table of contents. Nothing on VBA/Macros. This is the very meat of what I wanted to learn. Before someone askes why I did not look inside, the page does not offer it. Not what I need and you probably won't either if you know Office. I am selling on Marketplace"
2,Poor quality,"Purchased these for my mother who had been looking for these type of aluminum coolers. When we received them, they had a strong petroleum type smell. We washed them but still can detect a faint odor. After a couple of HAND washings... the colors faded and peeled off. She still enjoys using the tumblers but definitely not something she put out for entertaining."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I grew up drinking from these glasses at my grandma's house. My mom bought them for all 6 of us girls for Christmas this year. After one washing in a gentle dishwasher, the paint peeled right off of one, and faded off the rest. My heart sank. I would recommend purchasing for nostalgia only, or hand-washing if planning to use them. The colors are gorgeous, though, and they kept the drink cold - just like the good ol' days."
5,Love these!!,"I received these tumblers for Christmas and I love them! They remind me of my favorite cups that my grandad had when I was a child, except they're bigger (which is a big plus). The colors are very vibrant and they have a cool, ribbed look. I'm one of those people that can never get my beverages cold enough and these cups keep drinks icy cold!"
5,Any translation/ compilation by Bhikkhu Bodhi is right on.,"Any translation of Buddha's teachings needs to be suspect in the mind of the student. Unless the translator is diligent and clear, much will be distorted. Use your discerning mind/body as you read, contemplate, and see if the words ring true. Be well and happy on your path my friends."
3,Good reference,"Good reference. Well written, translated. The only slight negative is that it does not include all the suttas from the Numerical Discourses."
3,"Classic, hard to understand Marx","While it is true that Marx may be one of the harder theorists to understand, this book didn't really give me a better understanding of anything. If you want a good amount of straight Marx text, this is the book for you. If you want to understand Marx and learn about his work, I suggest looking into the introductory texts of George Ritzer. He does a MUCH better job a getting Marx across to the reader than anything in this book."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for!,"Under a billion suns is somewhat lacking the ingredients of what made this band great. I'm not saying it isn't any good, but just an average overall effort. It starts out promising with a errie e-minor riff and some decent horn sections. Then It is us goes back to earlier territory with the stooges influence intact. I saw the light is a quick blues romp and fits quite nicely. Endless Yesterday is a departure sounding more like a ballad that could have been done by Trail of Dead, but it works very well. Mark Arm actually is trying to sing more which is shows there are stetching out some. The bad news is after Endless Yesterday the rest of the album is quite spotty and at times bland. Empty shells is nothing more than a stale attempt of retreading old ground. There are also an overuse of the horns to attempt to hide the bland songwriting. Under a Billion Suns is worth getting if you are a fan, but dont expect too much."
2,Received the wrong discs,I received the wrong discs. I didn't notice this until I got around to watching the second DVD. I had two of disc 1. By that time it was too late to do anything about it. Now if I want the rest of that saga I need to buy it again.There are way too many cases of this!
2,I also received the wrong discs in Piccolo Jr. Saga Pt. 2,"I recently bought this two disc set at a ""Suncoast Video"" store.Imagine my surprize when I got home & opened the case to find both discs of the ""King Piccolo Saga Pt2."" Whoa! Good saga, but I already own it!! I took the set back to Suncoast ASAP. I was told it was a factory mix-up and all they could do was exchange it for another copy of the same title......but they didn't have another copy in store ( hummm...).They ordered a replacement set; but I haven't been notified yet that it's in ( been about two weeks so far... ) Hope they call soon *sigh*It's kind of funny that I've heard several stories like this concerning this set. The outside wrapper, and the inside flyer were correct, only the discs were to the King Pt2 saga... Wonder how many copies like this made it onto the streets? Any more people have a mix-up like this? Would probly give this 4 stars if I ever ""SEE"" it..."
1,DONT BUY IT,Dont buy this dvd it have rong dvds i order it 2 times alredy its contain king picclo not Jr piccolo
3,DVD mix up,"These are really great episodes, but I recently recieved mine and the wrong DVD's were in the case. I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else, and if so how did they handle such a stuation. thank you"
4,A good source for the tech side of ghosthunting,"I found Ghost Tech to be informative and educational. I'm not sure about all his views but the author gives fairly detailed explanations for his methodology. His interspersed humor adds nicely to the read although can be a bit overdone at moments. My single biggest criticism is the lack of editing done with this book. Typos and mispellings occur throughout, although not as severely as a Troy Taylor book. White Chapel Press needs to hire an editor."
3,Good starter book ...,"Vince Wilson's ""Ghost Tech: The Essential Guide to Paranormal Investigation Equipment"" is a good intro slash overview book, a sort of Ghost Gadget 101. It covers a range of gear at a fairly high level, and includes just enough science to give the reader a reasonable idea as to how Device X might actually be useful on a Ghost Hunt. I recommend buying it and would buy it again.But if there were to be a Second Edition, I would work a bit on the packaging, as the ""manifesto"" look did not improve the book's readability at all. Also, the illustrations were too few, too small, and somewhat poorly labeled (where's the nomenclature?). Given the subject matter, the book could be tripled in size without much padding, as there are a lot of areas that could be covered more thoroughly. Such a ""handbook"" version could, with Vince's considerable knowledge and experience of the subject matter, easily become the field ""bible"" for the next 10 years."
3,Disappointing,"I was so excited to see Mr. Wilson's book on the market. It wasn't until I purchased the book and read its contents that I realized that my excitement was in vain. Mr. Wilson provides a very closed-minded opinion on select items and only gives a positive review on the higher-tech, higher priced gear. On a positive note, Mr. Wilson has written his text in a humerous and personal way that pulls the reader in for an enjoyable - although inacurate read."
3,Yawn,"First of all, a little advice...anyone who is thinking of writing a book should spend a little money on an editor/proof-reader before the book goes to print. There are so many spelling/grammatical errors in this book, it seemed like it was written by a guy in junior high school...very amateurish. The ""humor"" in this book is also a bit juvenile. Thinking of buying this book? Here's a better idea: Save your money and wait until your local library carries it. Much of the book is simply common sense and contains information readily available on the internet for free. Nothing remotely new and exiting here. The Ghostbusters ""fun"" section should've been left on the cutting room floor. If this guy can make money writing a book like this, I have to start my writing my own book. Is it really that easy?"
1,not what expected,"i ordered a CD which i thought was by jason lee of memphis blue and received a CD from an unknown person. i asked before purchashing if it was the jason lee of memphis. maybe they forgot my question. anyway, i received a full credit, so am satisfied."
5,It works great! We love it!,"We wish we had known this turboshear was available a long time ago! It cuts through metal roofing panels like butter. It cuts straight, and easily. It takes 1/4 the time to complete the task. It is worth the price. We ordered it requesting next day delivery and even in our rural area we received it the NEXT DAY."
2,Not so Good,I bought this item to cut my roofing angles and length. It would not easily or correctly climb over the center ridges on the roof sheets.
5,Great item,I was cutting metal barn siding/roofing with this tool and what a blister saver! cuts like butter. I would highly recommend it. Used it on a cordless craftsman and also a dewalt corded drill
1,Not as described,I ordered this to cut fiber cement board. Fortunately I bought a test piece before I bought the whole amount I was going to cut. The brace kept slipping off of the drill and then it spun and popped my hand which hurt. It would not cut the board - mainly gouged it. Then finally the brace broke which if the thing would have worked I could have used the replacement brace I bought because of the combined three items suggestion. YOU DON'T NEED THE BRACE because one comes with it. And if the brace breaks it means the item is faulty. By the way I am a carpenter with over 20 years of experience. This is not a good product. Buy an actual shear not one that hooks up to your drill or catch cancer by breathing in fiber cement dust as you rip the boards with a skil saw.
2,Far from a complete guide,"I wasn't terribly impressed by this book - it was missing a great deal of basic information, had very incompletely coverage about such traditional skills such as picking locks, manually cutting keys, etc. Instead the author emphasises circumventing locks through alternative methods (for example by shearing off retaining bolts/screws and pulling a core). I found the coverage of large number of locks helpful for locks that I have not come in contact with, but overall I was not very impressed by this book."
4,lockpicking and the art,lockpicking is an art to master the art you need to understand the objective whether its a a 5 pin lock or an 8 you need to understand it to pick it. This book will help you understand the basic fundementals of a lock. Ounce you have read this book you will be that much better. This is a must read for all!
2,Uninformative,"This book may have the illusion of usefulness to those who already know what they're doing. But to the newcomer, many of these concepts will seem glossed over, talking about things conceptually instead of teaching how to do them. Not worth it."
3,"Basic information, but there are better books","Covers general information about many kinds of locks. Really lacks information for bypassing and picking, but a good basic locks book."

4,GOOD LISTENING,"There are some great hooks on this under-appreciated opus and some fine guitar riffs, as well. ""Rivers (of the Hidden Funk)"" is probably the best cut, but ""A Life of Illusion"" and ""Things"" are also right up there. This album was originally released in 1981 on Elektra and, as a rule, they don't put out junk. You can rip this one and combine its tracks with the ones you like from SMOKER, and you'll have a good listening experience that might make the commute to and from work a tad joyful, if that's possible."
4,Down on the Farm,"I give this album 4 stars because of Life of Illusion and Down on the Farm. These are two great songs. Life of illusion is a serious song with excellent guitar work. Down on the farm is a comical song that also has some cool guitar in it. Mabey this album isn't his best or anywhere near it, but there are at least two good songs on it."
3,not bad,"If you're a joe walsh fan you'll like it. Things, Down on The Farm, and Life of Illusion are great songs."
3,The Perils of Mobile Home Communities,"""Pain's the way it feels/when you live your life on wheels"" Mr. Joe Walsh should have been a better student of his own lyrical insights. Had he been such, he would not have been so surprised on the morning of January 6, 1981, when he woke to find that his beloved neighborhood had indeed 'gone', and hardly voluntarily.Vultures came for him then, but no Eagles. ""Got any gum, fresh carrion?""Two stars for his anguish; one for the tank.MSP"
2,"Joe, on the way down","""There Goes the Neighborhood,"" released in 1981, marked the descent of Joe Walsh from progressive rock force to lightweight has been. The songwriting here is almost uniformly lackluster, save for ""Life of Illusion,"" a catchy single that can be had on many of his anthology albums. The song ""Things"" typifies the kind of stuff that Walsh was writing at the time. It has an okay groove, but the lyrics are so utterly incosequential that you know the artist had run out of things to say. The problems with Walsh that started here would only get worse as the 1980s dragged on. A sad end for a once formidable artist."
4,Hard Hitting,"A fine CD from an under appreciated band. Production and mixing are lacking, but the songs are great."
2,Doesn't protect from cold!,used it while goose hunting in 30 defree weather...feet/toes were cold. had to use toe warmers! will have to get a new pair.
5,"""Excellent CD Recording of Mr. Kaempfert!!""","My dad and I really liked this Bert Kaempfert CD ""Bye Bye Blues"" a lot because it's popular, good sound quality, and best of all, Kaempfert's style on all 12 tracks from the original LP plus 7 bonus tracks including the original version of ""Monte Carlo"" from the LP ""The Magic Music of Far Away Places"". Moreover, Mr. Kaempfert gets a lot of ideas from Count Basie and Harry James. I think that this CD ""Bye Bye Blues"" is excellent, and my dad and I really felt confident with this good recording for a long time."
4,"It's what I expected,,,,good!",Nice renditions of classic favorites I listened to as a kid. The big band sound with a smooth jazz feel. Nice easy listening !
5,The World Religions,This book is concise and very informative. I enjoy looking at the pictures too.I use this book in my verbatim on Primitive Spirituality. Now this has a permanent place in my library. I highly recommend this to students on their spiritual journey.Rev. Deacon Gary V.
5,Simply put... the best.,"Simply put, this is the best album of the best singer/songwriter of the twentieth century."
5,"Some ""date"" but some ""court and spark""","My all-time favorite Joni Mitchell album in ""portable format."" Sigh. Does life get any better? Yep: it's called amazon.com prices and service! This album contains J. Mitchell's usual wonderful toe-tapping tunes; lyrics that punch you right where you live; even a little goofiness in the guise of the song ""Twisted."" (Perhaps that analyst did Ms. Mitchell some good after all!) ""Court and Spark,"" ""Free Man in Paris,"" and ""Raised on Robbery"" are personal favorites as well, but I've listened very hard over The Years of Vinyl, and never found a ""clunker"" in this bunch!"
5,wistical,"This music was the soundtrack for an all-too-brief courtship in northern Arkansas in 1975-76. I have evolved beyond the person I was then but not beyond this timeless music or beyond the influence of the woman I met on the Norfork Lake ferry. That love sparked a string of serendipities and synchronicities that continue three decades later. ""Court and Spark"" could not have been equalled by any other music for the poetic commentary it provided to that interlude and my second birthing."
5,Jazzy Change for Joni,"Joni begins her jazz journey, with a much denser layer of production. Tom Scott and the LA Express fill the grooves with lush winds. She gets assistance from another Canadian great, Robbie Robertson, on probably her most rocking tune, ""Raised on Robbery"". The engineering production on that tune grabs the listener immediately. The disk is brilliant from cover to cover, including the airplay hits, ""Court and Spark"", ""Help Me"", ""Free Man in Paris"", through the remake of the ""Crazy"", with guest vocals by Cheech and Chong. I love this disk, and I recommend it highly. Joni's guitar tunings are set to showcase the strength of her vocal range, and her piano is lovely as well."
5,Art Song Apotheosis,"I've admired Joni M. from a distance for years, but I never really sat down and listened to her until I popped my wife's copy of Court and Spark on tonight. Holy smokes, I'm hooked. The drama of every song on this album, a woman adventurer throwing herself headlong into love and finding that nothing is more binding than freedom, well, Joni puts it across with some of the most beguiling melodies to ever hit the Top 40. This is not a coffee house folk singer hippie Madonna (no, not Ciccone, I'm talking center-parted hair, peasant blouse, acoustic guitar), this is one tough,clear-eyed woman with a way with words and a rhythmic sense gleaned from her recent discovery of mid-'60's Miles Davis, put over on the really odd but just right chord progressions she strums. Her only pop music peer for words that actually scan well is Lou Reed, except Joni can sing. Lush, deep, and I'll say it again, for a Laurel Canyon millionaire, tough as death and taxes."
5,Helped me Study while in College,"Hallelujah! the college library allowed students to listen to music while studying in the library. 'Court and Spark' on headphones ... studying ... 1971 ... was great then, and it's still a great album!"
5,Dancing up a river in the dark..,Just wanted to say that lines like this make the album for me. Such incredible lyrical prowess. I've had this album for 20 years(?) and recently took it out for a spin.. I was amazed to find that after all this time it FINALLY sunk in at all levels. Very emotional. Just listen to the haunting way storylines unfold in songs like `Court and Spark' or `Just Like this Train'. Could you say that much with so little?
2,Where oh where did my Joni go ?,"I'm sorry but....no. BIG BIG Joni Mitchell fan as I am, COURT AND SPARK and I had a tough time. I guess I was looking for the Joni I came to know in BLUE and LADIES OF THE CANYON. Sure artists mature and evolve, playing with styles and composition, but sometimes it didn't even sound like Joni at all. The songs on C&S felt foreign and almost too radio friendly to me. I just feel that if you have to listen to Joni seeking difference, try Hejira. She did it much better there. Just my opinion."
4,Some Atmospheric Tones,"Joni Mitchell will always be known as a premiere singer/songwriter from the sixties/early seventies. On Court And Spark, her songs have many intriguing folk and jazz elements. Like the bopping beat to Twisted and the subtle drive to Raised On Robbery. Thats an interesting combination.The vocals are kind of airy and soothing. Just listen to Free Man In Paris and Help Me. The lyrics are fairly captivating. A genius at three? Maybe not but certainly quite catchy.Whereas I am not a huge fan of this style, I respect the creativity and unique tones. A rounded four star rating since 3 1/2 is not an option."
3,Not For Everybody,"Just like my title says, this album is not for everybody. Joni's voice does take some getting used to, but the payoff is great. Songs like Just Like this Train, Free Man in Paris, and the title song are probably some of the most beautiful of her career.I have tried to turn so many of my friends on to her but none have converted. I can see why. But I see beyond the voice and listen to the words. Just wonderful. Put this on an early Sunday evening, pour a glass of wine, light candles and enjoy."
4,EDDIE FISHER -- LIVE,"A live recording is always the ACID test of any performer. Gone are the overdubs, breaks and such. It's just YOU and the audience. Most of this recording is palatable, even exciting at times. The only thing that truly bug me is his obvious imitation of ""Jolie"" doing his songs. I don't mind him doing the songs, but why this insipid imitation? Leave that to Rich Little! Great remastere sound, and to be honest, a great collection of songs, but noticablely missing ""I'm Walking Behind You."" He was good, but not incredible, which perhaps explains why he is no longer performing."
5,Eddie Fisher at the Winter Garden,"It is a great album but, of course, I am prejudiced because he was always one of my favorites. He sounds as though he mellowed during the years and even has a sense of humor that I don't recall before."
1,Horrible Book - Avoid At All Cost,"I was considering using this book for an optics course I teach and had a good look through it. The book is terrible, one of the worst I have ever read. It simply has very little useful information. Its as if the authors randomly left out two-thirds of the information the students would need to understand anything. There are terms, variables, drawings, etc. that aren't explained. There are simple, standard explanations that are left out. And there are many mistakes in the formulae. If you buy this book and try to read it, you will be thoroughly confused."
2,bubble lights,"The lights are fine, but the clips on them that are used to attach the lights to the tree are seriously defective. They break off as soon as you try to clip them to the tree, rendering them next to useless. If you are looking for bubble lights, my advice. Look eslewhere"
1,Do not buy,"I bought these from another place last year and returned them. They broke coming out of the box. I don't recommend bubble lights. They contain an extremely hazardous liquid - methylene chloride. It will burn your skin and cause serious problems if you inhale the fumes. This company is the worst because the material is cheap and breaks so easily, but even the better ones can break rather easily."
3,Success and struggles at work and romance,"Bubbles is now a rookie reporter for the News Times and getting sent to a string of Town Board meetings. She and Lorena Ludwig, her photographer, are covering the trial of Julia Simon, aka Crazy Popeye, who is accused of killing Rudy Schmidt, the local high school principal. Due to circumstances beyond her control, Bubbles is locked up with Julia before she dies. Bubbles instinctively takes notes at this informal interview before Julia dies. Notes that makes Bubbles a wanted woman. Bubbles cannot help but get further involved in trying to solve the case. Steve Stilleto comes to her rescue when she is unceremoniously kidnapped by Karol Smolak. Steve Stilleto offers Bubbles a temporary engagement ring that causes a stir with her mother and Genevieve. Bubbles and Steve take matters into their own hands when her daughter Jane is taken hostage. The ending is somewhat convoluted; however Bubbles does get her man. A good weekend read."
2,Not the best in the series...,"I thought the book was not as well put together as the others in the series. The plot was far too convoluted. Too many characters in and out with nothing to lock on to them by. At times it seemed like I had missed a chapter because characters were doing things that I didn't remember them talking about (i.e., Jane was going to be speaking at the service). Anticipating the next one in the series."
3,"Intriguing Subtext, not for the faint of heart","I can't say I think this is Bubbles at her best but there are things to be enjoyed here. There is a rather odd whiff of nihilism to this series, which seems to uh bubble up rather forcibly here. Granted it's a candy coated nihilism but all the more fascinating for that. Indeed people often laugh in my face when I mention that there is more than a bit of Nietzsche or middle era Husserl in these books but it's there.All in all a pleasant stylist and mostly a sprightly read, if it leaves you with a gnawing sense of vertigo well there you are...whether that is quite the author's intention however I can't say..."
5,A Veritable Gem,"This cookbook is gem! While I am not a vegetarian, I do try to prepare and serve healthy foods. These interesting recipes will definitely help me accomplish this goal. I am drawn into each page and recipe by the author's informative comments and serving suggestions. Most of the ingredients are common and attainable, which is refreshing since some vegetarian recipes can be quite complicated. I hope to find the Goddess in me as I eagerly make my way through these culinary delights!"
5,"wonderful, first-rate music from a very obscure composer","All the pieces on this CD have a somewhat 'exotic flavor' about them - the melodies, harmonies, indeed overall ""sound"". One can readily imagine scenes from more remote regions of SE Europe on hearing them. While there's no telling whether any other of Djabadary's works are anywhere near the equal of those on this CD, i would take a chance & immediately buy further recording(s) of his music.A note about my musical tastes (as guidance to others): my interest spans from the Renaissance (Gabrieli) to even near mid-20th century (Bartok) in musical 'idiom', if you will. But my heart lies in the Romantic era, including its extension into the early 20th century ( this latter most notably perhaps in Richard Strauss' writing). Djabadary's 'idiom' lies within the later part of the Romantic era, but well within it. His music also reminds me of the work of two Romanian composers, whose names escape me @ moment."
2,After Reading this Book,"Sorry to burst everyone else's bubble. I thought the first 1/3 or so of the book was excellent. Rhys was able to develop the characters, although writing in a 'minimilist' style. However - the rest just went on, and on, granted, she created a great sense of this woman's life; but that's all she did. It was so drab - life was so bad - there was SO much more the author could have done. Like 'flesh out' the relationship she had had with her Mom; explain WHY Julia couldn't stand people, etc. Even if she had Julia moving even MORE away from people, and created that more deeply 'untrustworthy' feeling she had - but no. Also - why was the man, Mr. Horstworthy(?) attracted to her. She should have developed that character - did he fight in the war and it changed him to help those in need? Did he have a sister who was depressed all the time? Rhys just kept 'repeating' herself."
3,"Cogent, but Disappointing","In this book, Ms. Himmelfarb shows that she is a political theorist. She makes cogent arguments about civil society and political institutions. However, I found the book very disappointing in its coverage of the more recent etiology of the two cultures: she says nothing of the legions of ultra-leftists now dominating academic, literary, and journalistic circles. She also neglects the rightward shift in American politics and the rise of the religious right since the Carter era. I also found her arguments long-winded and tiresome. This is a book written to impress academics, not to inform the general reader.If you want political theory from de Tocqueville and since, this could prove worthwile. If you want to understand what really divides us as a people, read something else."
2,"One Nation, Two Cultures - Review","Some interesting points made, the author is too quick to draw a strong line connecting the ""moral decay"" of our society in part to non-traditional families. She focuses too strongly on the negative statistics associated with our changing family structure while under-stating the benefits (and statistics) that show how this individualism has allowed our country to prosper and which has provided women and minorities a world of opportunities which did not exist 50 years ago."
2,"short book, long winded","I read Himmelfarb's book hoping to gain some insight as to the ""moral decay"" that so many talk about...what I found was:a) simplistic values and generalities overstated,b) many ""moral deficiencies"" undiscussed, andc) no solutions.Her book reads like a long-winded essay that hopes to impress because it uses big words and has lots of footnotes to show she ""did her homework."" Unfortunately, she uses statistics selectively and only when they help her point (using the phrase ""But statistics don't tell the entire story..."" far too often). She also cuts references' contexts, so that her point is made (even if the reference is not quite on the same line of thinking).After completing the book, I must admit that it's a wonderful thing to always be right. Had a black, single mother written this same book, it would never have been published. Connections help!"
4,An unsung classic in extreme rock...,"I've never accually seen someone strangle himself to death, but this album probably gives me a good idea what it would sound like. Zeni Geva is a rock band only in the most grotesque and distorted sense of the phrase, combining jazz and punk with pure noise to create a sonic doorway into blinding pain, both emotional and physical. ""Stigma"" and ""Dead Sun Rising"" open the portal wide to introduce the listener to new dimensions of suffering, while the title track and ""Heathen Blood"" shove you straight into it. By the time ""Autopsy Love"" and ""The Body"" wind down, your senses are all but hemmoraging.Japanese-sung lyrics become billy clubs to the head and body, guitar riffs become steak knives in the neck. Melodies exist only to amplify feelings of dread and terror. If anyone feels scared upon first listen, that's the point.Recommended for those who think Swans and Godflesh aren't dark enough."
2,Sammy dissapoints,When I lay out cash for a music dvd I want to see a band play the music. If I want all of the background or other interesting trivia I like to see it in another section. I purchased this dvd based on the other reviewers who failed to mention that two of the songs are interupted with Sammy's comments to his fans and how if offered he would consider rejoining van halen.I even checked to make sure I had not put the bonus disc in because of all the behind the scenes footage mixed in with the songs. If your intent is to put this dvd in the player and crank it up plan on keeping the remote handy. The real dissapointment is you are forced to endure 5 minutes of jabbering between songs.
4,Great DVD!,"Sammy did a great job putting this together. Plenty of clips from the last tour in which he demolished Dave every night. But this DVD shows him with Michael Anthony and the rest of his band having a great time on and off the stage. The second disc is great too. His solo videos are here including the great live video of ""Baby's On Fire."" Also included are commentaries on the making of each video. Any Sammy or VH fan should pick this up....it is definately worth it. Thanks Sammy!"
5,One of this Best,"If you are contemplating getting a Tom Waits album this, The Heart of Saturday Night, and Nighthawks at the Diner are two of his best. Perfect diamonds set in time. This was Tom at his jazzy-bluesest singing some of the most beautiful songs he has ever composed. This is Tom's voice at it's most sweetest and purest before he tortured it to the point where now he sounds like broken glass over rough gravel. This is a must have for any collection."
4,You know...,"The one thing that I've found throughout all Tom Waits' albums, is the unity of them. Every album can be listened to from beginning to end, it tells a story. I just can't figure outwhat this one's saying. It's the only CD of Tom's that I own, (which is everything but Blue Valentine) that doesn't spend any special amount of time in my CD player. It just don't click with me, dig? But it gets four stars based on being from Tom Waits, nothing else is required."
4,"Not as good as ""Closing Time""","This record is dominated by the slightly derivative style that Waits spent about half of ""Closing Time"" working on -- the 40s' jazzy pop tune. Lyrically, this record is less about love and more about the poetic description of the nightlife, but there are still no narratives and little musical innovation. The songs themselves are often sketchy and soundalike -- in fact, very little sticks with you afterwards with a few exceptions: the spoken ""Diamonds On My Windshield"" and ""the Ghosts of Saturday Night,"" the simple, moving ""Heart of Saturday Night"" and the sweet ""San Diego Serenade."" This isn't to say that the album isn't enjoyable, it's just that Waits hadn't found his groove yet."
3,"Essential, yet partially formed brilliance that is Tom Waits","While the album has some stand out classics (the heart of saturday night being the best by miles) Waits has been on better form, and from subsequent albums develop his style further. Comparing this to some of his other early phase albums, (blue valentine, small change, etc.) this is filled with some fairly average tunes. Stick to ""the asylum years"" collection, that has all the good tracks from this and other early albums."
5,Essential,"An absolute indesputable classic. Among the best of the songer/songwriter, Pop/Rock albums - ever. And in the midst of the flowering of the best of that genre - quite a feat. Tom Waits never topped this masterpiece - though Small Change was close. His voice is moving and genuinely emotional - long before he later became a parody of himself. This folks, is great songwriting.My one caveat is that the recording could use a re-mastering to contemporary standards. Obviously the CD is a direct transfer from the original record master - dull and thuddy. But dispite this, Waits' early genius shines through."
5,Top Notch Scruffy Street Blues,"This is an Example of topnotch blues from the street, Raw and inspirational, unconventional and uncompromising.. This is music that goes straight to the heart than stays there long after the Cd has stopped...Tom Waits have always had a gift of originality and uniqueness in his music, a Gift that is sorely lacking from modern-day music like Britney Spears and Back Street Boys.. He sings about life in a way that everyone can reckognize and relate to.. I know that I certainly can.. Especially with the song ""San Diego Serenade"" and ""Ghost of saturday night""...All in all well spent money if you like this kinda thing:) and even an interesting buy if you never have heard Tom Waits before..This is a man whose music is truly and considerably down to earth and REAL.."
4,Tom Waits has a voice as warm as single malt scotch.,"I first heard Tom Waits 20 years ago and we're still friends after all these years. Waits'voice is at once familiar and comforting and his jazz-tinged blues sound is rich and vibrant. His use of horns is tasteful and hypnotic. This is late night, early morning music when you can't get to sleep and you can't stop thinking about that special someone and what it feels like to have her arms wrapped around you on a cold night."
5,Great stuff.,"This is great blues/jazz stuff. The best track is ""Please call me, baby."" The whole album has a nice flowing feel to it. A few tracks seem overblown to me, which is why the rating's 9 instead of 10, but this is still a great album."
1,Don't buy this book unless you're DEEP into technical stuff,"This work is far too technical for the average person looking for a reasonable guide for stretching exercises. I found it virtually useless for my needs simply because it is so deep. If you're deep into athletic work and record keeping, it's probably a good book, however."
4,A Must-have for all advanced sports players,"An excellent manual on how and more importantly why you need to stretch. Content is good (how many authors pose for the pictures in their fitness manuals?) and the FAQs are illuminating. However, it should have had a more step-by-step approach that beginners may find helpful."
2,Not updated enough,"Images are black and white, paragraphs are as boring as communist propaganda.Texts are too old (20 y.o. ?).Daily routines are missing."
2,Feels dated,"You've likely heard of the Sandler selling system and may have met some of the franchisees. This recording has clips of David Sandler live, which is nice. This pre-Internet content itself feels dated (though I've still heard franchisees use elements).If you're thinking of getting Sandler training, you might want to get this program (and try more than one franchisee) before deciding."
3,joey vs. yugi/yami,ok this dvd contains 4 episdoes keiths machination parts 1-2 and best of friends best of duelists parts 1-2 in keiths machination keith takes a card that you need in order to duel but mia gave hers to joey so he could duel but keith cheated with his cards but no matter what joey at the end won. then the next two were about joey duels yugi this is a hard duel best friends DUELING EACH OTHER. anyways it was a average movie i think.
4,From the view of a female pilot...,"I really enjoyed this book. It was given to me as a gift because it was a book about ""women who fly."" Since I am a pilot I am often given books about flying (fiction, biography, you name it). This book got my attention right from the start and I felt the action and characters were believable. It is a page-turner, can't-wait-to-see-what-happens-next kind of fiction that is fun to read. A perfect beach or vacation read where you can lose yourself and just go along for the ride."
3,Edgar award nominee . . . I dunno?,"Thankfully, this lost out in the Best First Novel category to The Blue Edge of Midnight by Jonathon King and, quite frankly, really is a weaker entry in the overall list. This is a good beach or porch read and can be blown through in about a day and a-half - the chapters are short and the line-spacing deep.The story centres around a suspended commercial pilot who tries to get to the bottom of the runway crash that resulted in the aforementioned suspension and the deaths of several passengers.The book, without doubt, is a real page turner, but you'll have to truly reign in your disbelief as the book winds down to its conclusion over the eastern seaboard. Nonetheless, if you've ever read Sidney Sheldon (he of TV fame), you'll enjoy this . . . but be forewarned, Chapter 39 is arguably the hokiest and most soap opera-like ever committed to print."
5,"The best guide, A real lifesaver for planning your trip","My boyfriend purchased two guides to assist us in Trekking up to Gokyo Ri in our Nepal backpacking expedition. The book alone got us safely through the entire trip without ever becoming seriously lost (although it helps to be able to ask passing locals too). Best of all, we happened to bump into the author at a cafe in Kathmandu before the start of our trip!"
2,Self absorbed author,For the most part this book is decent. It is made better by the fact that it is almost impossible to get lost on the Everest or Gokyo treks. The author is in love with himself and spends lots of time describing things that have nothing to do with you finding the trail. The maps are hand written and not to scale. If it weren't obvious you might get lost. Unfortunately books like lonely planet focus on all of the Nepal treks and therefore are not as in depth.
3,Good but not the full story...,"Huh? I finished the book and have SOooooooo many questions... I need another book. This is the end of the series? What the?!? Come on! I like Celeste but this book really, really, REALLY reminded me of the Orphans/Wildflowers sets. The whole back and forth with adoptions and the orphanage... I feel there was a lot more to the story... I wanted to see what happened to Big Celeste/Noble. What happened? Did the spirits ever come back to Baby Celeste? Did the end result of the family lead to further babies?All in all good but not complete. Much better than Willow's books at least."
2,Predictable Story,From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story.
4,Pretty Good Ending To the Saga,"This was a pretty good book. The story line was pretty crazy, in true V.C. Andrews fashion! It was not the best V.C. Andrews book that I've ever read, but I enjoyed it a lot and had a really hard time putting it down. The plot twists will definitely surprise you and you will enjoy how the story wraps up in the end. It's still twisted in terms of what happens in the plot line, but it did not have the same tone as the first two books. Overall, if you enjoy V.C. Andrews, you will enjoy Child of Darkness."
4,better than the 2rd one,I liked this one. You knew the the girl was going to be raped but the reason was not just to rape her. This book is a lot better the the 2rd one. The first one was ok but this one was the best. She was not as messed up as her mother & grandmother. The grandmother was the worst & her mother didn't have a chance.
1,A huge disappointment,"After reading Black Cat(which I rated a 3 out of 5) I was only eager to read Child of Darkness to learn where Celeste and Baby Celeste end up. Well this book barely touches on the life of Celeste- she is only in one scene of the book, and she is locked away in a mental institution. Baby Celeste is nothing of the pragmatic youth we see in Black Cat. She seems to be an ordinary girl(which is a breath of fresh air) but the story has very little plot, the resolution is so calcualted it is insulting and the ending......well there is very little I can say about the ending without seeming crude, angry and snobbish. All and all I believe Black Cat is a pulitzer winning book in comparison to this novel. The ghost writer doesnt even try to caputre the essence of V.C. Andrews. Dont even waste your time on such nonsense. Dont even read it for free in a bookstore- pick up another V.C. Andrews book. This one is by far the worst."
2,Very disappointing,"I will not write much on the obvious flaws of this book, how it left many questions unanswered, etc. This has been written by others already. I just wanted to add something that no one else seems to have commented on. The ghost writer screwed up the timeline again (as he has done in previous books). In the beginning of the book, (big) Celeste is interviewed at the mental clinic. The doctor's report says she is 17 yrs, 4 months old. The doctor mentions that Baby Celeste was 6 yrs old at the time. That would've made big Celeste 11 yrs old when she had her! Huh?! In the book ""Celeste"", when Celeste meets Elliot Fletcher (who later gets her pregnant), she tells him she is 15 yrs old. So, by the beginning of the book ""Child of Darkness"", big Celeste should've been 21 yrs old. Apparently, Andrew Neiderman does not know how to count! Get with the program, dude!And you should have written more about the fate of big Celeste, who was a much more interesting character anyway."
3,not exactly what the picture shows,"I recieved this item in the mail yesterday, first off Im a little upset that the print is not what the picture shows. More importantly the picture doesnt show that there are a total of 5 holes in the cube. I got this so that they could go inside and stay warm, obviously with 5 holes I doubt they will be much warmer. They do seem to love it just the same, but again is not exactly what I expected."
3,Schein,"Author feels obligated to justify everyone of his thoughts leading to some useful info, but also a lot of info that means nothing. This can make it harder to read since it goes in a direction then circles you back."
4,Really a lesson about organization culture,For every manager who wants to improve his organization it's a mast
1,"Small ""tate-ers"" for a poet of his caliber.","James Tate's most recent offering, ""Distance from Loved Ones,"" hit bookstores recently, after much hype and anticipation. Up to this point, I had suspended my judgment on the pernicious poet, but now I no longer straddle the fence on this issue. The title poem promises insight and melancholy, but quickly strays into a graphic erotic narrative involving his last several pets (all of which died mysterious deaths). The associative peregrinations he offers attempt to travel the road between the heart and the mind but never make it past his throbbing libido. I understand that he is a ""surrealist,"" but this slab of perversions is much too real for me. Tate is an unholy cross between Neitzche and Andy Griffith, and frankly, the only way you may possibly glean something from this tour de FARCE is if you don your standard issue goth trenchcoat and hit the local coffee house."
2,look for size measurements,"item was not as big as led to beleive by pictures. image pics were taken from mfg site, where there there were no size references, except for jaw width."
3,Imported,Have had many vises over the years including some excellent Wilton USA made models. This import is not even comparable to the vises of 30-40 years ago but is serviceable and not a bad buy. I use it in my garage for small lightweight projects. Clamps tightly and is pretty solid. Good hobby size. Not a vise for professional use.
1,JUNK,"broke right across the saddle, it was not over used, I won't have another if you gave it to me."
3,So far so good.,Gave this as a gift and it hasn't been used much yet but it looks to be ruggedand so far has been a good vise.
2,Not worth it,I bought this vise and sent it back right away. The swivel was very lose and it was just a cheap built vise. Amazon was great about taking it back. I printed out a label taped it on the box and dropped it off. Didn't cost me a dime other then 10mins at the post office.
3,About A Fanily,"This is a book by Anne Roiphe. It is about her family. Her family members aren't particularly likeable, but they're all she has. There is nothing much to say about this book. There are lots of words, but she only tells us what she wants to tell us. I am in the process of cleaning out my books, and this is not one I will keep. I would certainly never re-read it."
1,Boring and cloying!,"Anne Roiphe has been boring us for years in her columns in the NY Observer and her books. This new book is no exception. Her style, if that is what you call her way of writing, is so precious and overblown that you want to scream after reading a sentence.Besides, she has little nice to say about her parents or her brother, and a kind soul would keep all that to herself. She justifies her writing by claiming that as a writer, she needs to express herself in her book. What nonsense! My suggestion is to remember that she ""ain't"" no Virginia Woolf nor even Patty Bosworth, and we could all live happily enough without knowing what went on at some upper middle class apartment on Park Avenue. I suggest she write something challenging for once, that is about something which does not include Anne Roiphe as the center of the universe. It might do her some good to distance herself from herself for awhile."
4,Under My Skin,"This memoir got under my skin. I finished it a few days ago and I'm still thinking about it. Anne Roiphe's family seem monstrous and she doesn't always spare herself. I felt tremendous pity for her and her brother -- what could have become of such an intelligent, sensitive man if he hadn't been treated so badly as a child? I recently read Mary Karr's memoir of growing up in East Texas with poor and dysfunctional, but loving parents. It makes an interesting counterpoint to Anne Roiphe's rich, but cold family."
4,Powerful and Disturbing,"As with all of Anne Roiphe's books, 1185 PARK AVENUE is powerfully written. The title refers to the address of the apartment building in which she was raised.Still, as beautiful as her prose is to read, this is a difficult book. Her family was not a happy one, to say the least. And her personal history will not be of universal interest, appealing mostly to people of similar Jewish ancestry.Yet there is no question but, that on a broader basis, 1185 PARK AVENUE offers a singular examination of a particular population. Inescapably, Roiphe had a sad childhood."
2,Sharing the Misery,"I picked up ""1185 Park Avenue"" looking forward to insight on growing up Jewish on Park Avenue in the 1940's/1950's. Instead I found myself drawn into Anne Roiphe's remarkably dysfunctional family, where no individual escapes unscathed from this hellish home. I found the memoir to have no redeeming message or purpose, except to let Ms. Roiphe express her rancour at her unfortunate circumstances. What bothers me most is that in becoming so engaged in the sadness and anger of her family story, these negative vibes served to make me upset too. Another triumph of evil over redemption."
1,Too difficult for beginners,"I've had the CDs for a year now. It's so hard to get pass 3rd CD. It gets overwhelming. It's best to work with a SLS coach, but why pay for this way you're going to pay for a coach anyway?"
3,"Not worth the money, for a singing program very little actual singing.","Pros: There is a lot of CD's that are supposed to acheive objectives such as expanding the range, smoothing the break.Cons: that is pretty much all they focus on and all of the exercises are pretty much the same thing over and over again with just little changes, like going faster over the exercise, or changing from humming to lip rolls to tounge trills to mum mum mum (and variations of mum like gug etc) and noun changes. So pretty much all I did is just go up and down scales the whole time. I expected more actual singing from a singing program, there was basically no singing involved in it to teach the concepts. It also didnt adress to well how to improve the actual sound.I think the people who sell this get a commission so that is why they reccommend it before anything else when they ""review"" it.It is not worth the money and I would not reccommend buying it."
4,Helpful,"Even as a seasoned singer I found this set helpful, especially when it comes to disciplining myself to properly warm up my voice. My only complaint would be that it can be a little too repetitive at times."
2,Another Lie about increasing range,"Once again, another lie about increasing range. An octave?? Not a chance. Don't be fooled by this. The only way this program will help you dramatically is if you are a complete beginner or have never sang before. The lip rolls and tongue trills are great for warming up, but who needs a $200 warm up? I never increased my range one bit and I worked at this program religiously 5-6 days a week. He puts no emphasis on breathing or resonance, or rib expansion, which is singing 101. I'm not saying that the program is all bad, but I'm saying that Brett Manning is not half of what he claims to be, and you will NOT be singing like any of those people in his DVD. Every one of these people were born singers and for taking credit for their talents that makes him a phony. I would try something else for less money because I guarantee it will be worth just as much as this expensive dust collector."
1,Beware of Brett Manning's empty money-back promise,"A significant lure of the advertising of Singing Success was the comforting ""6-month coffee-stain guarantee"" (meaning that even if you left coffee stains on the CDs; clearly stated at his website, you'd get your money back). A couple weeks after receiving Singing Success, I decided this product was not what was expected and returned the set in perfect condition. This was over 2 months ago (return-receipt confirmed). Well, 9 weeks have passed and no one at Singing Success picks up or returns calls. It is unfortunate that one should have to chase after their credit like this, especially when their guarantee is so clearly stated. Think twice before doing business with Brett Manning's Singing Success."
3,Card not for Sony Cams,Tried this in my old Sony 2 megapixel camera (supposed to be the max size) and it didn't recognize it.Service was good though.
4,God's help guides abused wife and mom to her dreams,"Moving story of one woman's struggle for dignity after years of psychological abuse by her husband. Martha Chanda, a mother of four, endures years of abuse at the hands of her husband which also damages her relationship with her first child whom her husband refuses to allow to live with them even as he insists on having his own iligitemate children with him.This is a look at her struggles when she finally escapes the marriage in order to pursue dreams that have gone unfulfilled more many years. It also chronicles the challenges to her relationship with God during this time and how that relationship provides her with the strength when faced with situations beyond her control.I also appreciated the distinctive Zambian use of english. The author did a great job of capturing the way in which Zambians use the language which helped me have better picture of the characters she indtroduced me to."
2,Did not finish,Didnt engage me and I found it much too complicated. Will try again in the future and update you.Cant recommend it at this point.
1,extremely difficult to get through/not practical,"I've read the 10+ Buddhism and Meditation classics.I like clear, practical books. I hate unnecessary complication.The reader will have to be extraordinarily motivated to get through this book, which is written in a very academic style and has very little practical content."
5,Hilarious,"This series is great. Its very random humor but if you watched Adult Swim when it was starting out, you would understand it. Great show. It was ahead of its time imo."
5,"Rad, awesome, terrific!","This CD changed my life. The Hoosier Hot Shots were the pre-cursors to Spike Jones, and if you are a fan of his and haven't heard them yet, you are missing out!"
4,Easy reading,"Was a quick easy to read romance novel. New pretty much what the out come would be, but enjoyed it"
2,Predictable,Not one of my favorites. Very predictable. I personally won't be transmitted of the series. Characters weren't well thought out.
3,Almost a Bride,It was a cute love story but the story dragged on. There was more story development the author could have tried. It was okay.
3,Excellent read,I thoroughly enjoyed reading the ins and outs of Dave and Marty's lifelong love affair. I was rooting for a happy ending but realized I was almost at the end and no reconciliation in sight!!
2,Almost a ......,"I must be honest. This was a very predictable read. The plot is typical, couple meets after parting years before., sparks fly...I honestly thought I had read this book before. The writing was witty and tasteful. Not a hard read, great for a rainy afternoon."
2,Not interesting,Took a week to read boring. The story was predictable from the first chapter. The plot was just as interesting.
3,Almost A Bride,"Too bland for me....I like a little more mystery. Liked the idea of the lady running a ranch, of course, with the help of a man."
4,How sweet,Awww...this story was so sweet. The book was interesting and I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
3,decent,"The storyline was ok. The characters were good. It seemed like a soap-opera. I wouldn't recommend it. McClinn has sum promise, but this might not be the best book to stat with."
2,Too Much Back and Forth,"The story line seemed to be missing something. The reason Matty needed to marry Dave just didn't seem like it was enough for either of them to make the sacrifice. In addition, I eventually got tired of the back and forth with their feelings. They both had strong feelings for each other and Matty kept trying to deny the way she felt for him and it just kept going on in on. She'd give him a hint that she was interested and then remember that they were married in name only, and she'd eventually push him away. Eventually, it was to a point where I thought enough already! By the time they finally did come together as husband and wife, I'd lost interest in the story. I had about 30 more pages to go and just decided enough was enough. If you're looking for good chemistry and a little more action, then keep looking."
2,Seemed silly to me,"The descriptions in many reviews seemed to find this book engaging, so I ordered it ... am so glad it was free, as I think I read maybe 20% of it and was simply bored to tears. The writing was very formulaic - perhaps it is the ""romance novel"" style, but it didn't make me want to follow the events that would lead to the inevitable - Matty and Dave will live happily ever after. Frankly, it never got me to the point where I cared."
4,Almost a Bride,It was a wonderful page turner. Good charters and decent plot. Very well written. I am not much for reviews but if you want a light weekend read I highly recommend this book.
4,Love with a twist,At times this story kinda drug on...I skimmed through some pages out of boredom but overall was a good story. I could understand the hurt both Matty and Dave were going through. I enjoyed reading about ranch life. It was not the I can't put this book down story but I am still interested in reading more of this author's books.
5,very good read Great bok to start a trilogy,"The book really kept me interested. The characters were very realistic, and engaging.I couldn't put it down I kept having to read one more. I couldn't wait to get to the next book to see how things worked out for the other characters"
4,good read,A good love story that will make your heart swell. Strong characters and of course a man you wish were walking the earth to find.
4,Moving,It's a book about your first true love and finding out who you are and what you want fun reading
3,Three stars,It was a Slow read and a little predictable but good characters. Average romance book without the parts that draw you in.
3,typical romance,This was the first book I‘ve read by this author. It was a solid read. Not quite as steamy as I would have liked.
2,Not much of a story,"Too much content on body touching, made it boring. Ending was too predictable at the very beginning of the book."
2,Alright,Was alright . Not as good as I had hoped it was. May try another by this author but not sure.
5,Great reading,It was easy to get into and moved at a good pace. Kept my interest to the last page. Have never read anything by Patricia McLinn and looking forward to more of her books.
5,Heart warming,I love the fact that it is not your typical love story. It melts your heart and makes you think all at the same time. You really feel both characters and understand their motives.
4,Almost a Bride,I liked the story and it was a easy book to read... Matty was a character but the story was a bit far fetched to me as a reader.
4,Entertaining light read,"Fairly predictable, but the likeable characters are entertaining . I plan to pick up book two, even though I think it's fairly predictable who the next couple will be."
3,Almost a bride,"Cute love story. Another easy read and in a nice setting. Can see take offs from this story, would like to see if a series"
4,Almost a Bride,I liked the book a lot. At first I thought it was going to be silly but then the plot thickened and I really enjoyed it.
3,Allmost a Bride,This was a very good book. Wish that it was longer. Hope to read more like it in the future.
2,Not a Christian book.,I always order from the Christian Fiction list and this series definitely is not a Christian book. Should be taken off that list.
3,Review,Good for what it wa but not really one of my favorites. Someone else might like it though. Thanks for the read.
4,almost a bride,this book is farely fast to read . the action is good. this is a story about some times we see only one way to solve a problem
1,Awww. If we could all have do-over.,Sweet story of young love. To see these two work it out gives hope to the what ifs and could have beens
3,Book review,"The plot was a little out there, not realistic, maybe for the era but I found it hard to keep interested...just an ok read."
3,"Had Potential, Started off Great...","Typical Silhouette story, damsel in distress, strong capable man to the rescue who will love her and do anything for her until death do them part. Started out promising but by the middle of the story the structure went down hill fast. Ended like a flat balloon."
3,almost a bride,"Bright sunny story, made me smile and even a giggle, romantic and all ended well. found it hard to put down"
3,Almost a Bride,"This book was was entertaining, but sometimes it dragged. I prefer novels with more substance and ones that move faster."
3,surprising,"The general story line was ok. What I did not like was that the description of sexual scenes was too graphic for my taste. I had not read books by this author before, so I do not know if all of her books are written in a similar format. I think the book would have been more enjoyable if a lot more was left to the imagination."
4,Very sweet story,Very well written about two people who never truly stopped loving each other. There is graphic sex scenes in it though in case that is something you don't like.
4,Fluffy fun read,"I love cream puffs, and I enjoy reading a cream puff story every once in awhile. Almost a Bride is light and airy with some dark chocolate laced on top. Just like the characters. They are likable, lovable, and of course maddening to each other. I enjoy the Wyoming scenes, the explanations of ranch management within the romance story line. The book is predictable - but it's supposed to be. The characters run the story, just as they should. This is a perfect book for a fun, fast, romantic night's read."
2,Almost a bride,"Very light reading, would prefer more story or deeper story, overall average book for long afternoon. Will give try to anther book from this author."
5,Almost a Bride (Wyoming Wildflowers Book 1),"This was an enjoyable read, I liked the love hate relationship of the two main characters. I would recommend this book to others."
3,okay okay,"this book was average in that it wasn't bad, but the plot was very predictable. I was disappointed that nothing really happened, there was no climax, and the characters spent a lot of time thinking about things instead of doing. if they would have put those thoughts into action this book would have 5 out of 5 stars. May still read the sequel to find out what happens to the other characters in the book."
2,Very Slow,"This book is very slow reading and it was a waste of my time. The characters were likable, but it was very predictable. The whole book could have been finished in about 20 pages. I kept thinking something would happen to make it more interesting, and it didn't. Free is a good price for it."
1,I could not finish the book,"Standard romance formula. Characters ok, but I did not find them compelling. They act too much like impulsive, emotionally stunted teenages and I think they are close to 30 years old."
1,unable to read,The kindle app wouldn't open so I was unable to read the book the whole book. What I did read was great. Would have liked to finish it.
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I hate to pan a book, but I forced myself to finish it, scanning pages in the last 1/3 of the book to see if anything has happened to make it interesting. It shouldn't take a hundred plus pages for Matty to determine if she wants Dave Currick back after he told her he thought they should see other people. It seems like she should have had a pretty good idea after running away for 6 years before she came back.The end of the book is so sappy it will make you sick.I am so sorry I have to give this low of a review. I dearly love to read, but I need a good plot. This did not have one!"
3,So So,This book is very good. If you like a good romance check this book out.Looking for a good read you will love it.
4,Almost a bride,A 4 due to too much time spent on physical attraction. Appreciate the quality of the characters. Good plot but very predictable
4,Great stories!!! good characters!!,"Great stories like doctor who without the doctor, good job with the characters one leaves and another is woven right in all the doctor who , torchwood, sarah jane stuff seems to really do that well!"
2,love the episode. . . hate the sound problems!,I love David Tennant's Doctor and was thrilled when I started watching this episode. . . Thrilled for a moment. Then I realized I had to read lips because the audio mix was 80% score and 20% dialogue. I wish amazon would fix this audio problem.
2,If I could only read lips :(,"I believe that this was a great show (parts 1 and 2), BUT, the sound over powered the dialogue and one had to guess what was being said. First time ever that Amazon has let me down."
1,Where are the rest of the episodes?,"I would like to buy this as a season, but the way it is laid out here you can only purchase 3 individual episodes. The others are listed, but without a way to purchase them. Why? A few of the vintage Dr Who seasons are also like this."
2,Diminishing Discs . . . Diminishing Quality . . .,"First, I must state that the Sarah Jane Adventures are all superb and may many more be produced . . . The concern I have is that with each new release, the number of discs have diminished. Season one had 4 discs, season two had 3 discs and season three has only 2 discs. It seems that the production company has elected to produce lower quality long playing discs as well as eliminate most of the extras. (I purchased the BBC UK version and my review is based upon the same. The forthcoming USA version appears to have been produced similarly and potential consumers may wish to evaluate whether or not it will be worth your investment considering that the video has been significantly compressed to fit on only two discs compared to the first series' four and the second series' three discs.)"
2,What's with the LOUD MUSIC?,"My wife and I were looking forward to the special guest appearance(s) of Doctor Who's David Tennant -- not to mention another episode where Sarah Jane squares off with The Trickster. However, there's something seriously wrong with the sound mix -- the music and the sound effects were WAY TOO LOUD and continually drowned out all the dialogue. I tried all manner of adjustments to my television and my stereo system, to no avail. Good episode, terrible mix."
3,Intrusive music,"Always great to see the tenth Doctor, but I sure had a hard time hearing what any of the characters were saying, as they were most often drowned out by the overpowering music."
5,Excellent,"Really, jazz and popular song have never come together so well. Shearing is tasteful, Tormé equally so."
5,Great computer for a great price,"The Athlon 64 processor, 1 GB of RAM, and 250 GB hard drive in addition to the other Media Center features are a great value for a little over $700. Unless you're a PC gamer nerd, you should not have any complaints with this machine and you will find that what this HP Media Center delivers far exceeds the needs of the everyday PC user."
1,Garbage,"I ordered a computer from HP 3 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems. The customer ""service"" is the poorest excuse for service anyone has ever witnessed. As of now I wold sooner toss the 1400 dollar computer off a bridge than EVER reccomend anything from HP!"
5,Super machine - Great Value,System works great - easy to expand - Just plug it up and good. You'll want to add your own software but what comes with it is a good start.
2,I can't seem to sync with this book!,"She rambles on and on! There are many times she refers to Christian teachings throughout this book and relates it to the ET's. The point she misses is that Jesus, Mohammed and many other prophets were ET's themselves or were sent here via the ET's to guide us. We as humans, of course took what they had to say and changed it for our own good or so we thought. Just like the bible, there is more missinbg in the book than what's left for us to base the christian/ET teachings on."
2,message is lost...,"There was an interesting message of ""Oneness"" and ""self reliance "" in the book but was lost talking endlessly about how important this message, this work, this channeling and channeler is. It's tiring...after pages of the same question and answer that goes on and on trying to justify and validate its own credibility over delivering the message, it' s like, we get it already...move on...That s too bad because it had a few good themes in it that were originally written and worth taking a look."
1,"Ludicrous, even fo anime","A renegade submarine captain declares his new submarine its own nation(!) and draws an international incident upon himself. Painfully obvious, wearily derivative and driven by ludicrous logic, this absurd concoction blows itself apart in almost every way possible. Worthwhile for its howlingly hilarious dialogue."
3,Mildly satisfied,"Ok product. Not great. They ship it to you rolled up in such a tight package that it is virtually impossible to get it to lay flat. I've had mine for a few weeks, I've tried many methods, it still doesn't lay completely flat. The point of this product is to be easy to install and unobtrusive, but when it won't lay flat on the floor, it becomes something people trip over."
4,Great Product,The wire protector works just as described. This is one of the more cost-efficient models compared with others out there. It does the job and keeps you from tripping over wires and damaging your dsl line from walking on it. I would buy it again.
1,Fall apart lights,"What a disappointment! I bought three of these lights, one green, one blue, one red. The first one lasted only a few hours of use before the black plastic body crumbled from normal heat of the bulb. Second one did the same thing. Not even going to try the third one. Save your money, pay a little more and buy something higher quality."
2,Mac users beware!,"Well, the product description says the set is both PC and Mac compatible. So I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter. Lo and behold! Upon opening the box we discovered that the first game (Myst) is PC-compatible only. The other two games will work on the Mac. But why would anyone package a three-game set and advertise it as Mac-compatible when only two of the games can be used? Talk about stupid. So the set is going back. And I've got a disappointed daughter. Thanks, UbiSoft."
1,Noooo....puede ser...,"No puede ser semejante juego tan malo....No soy aficionado a los juegos de aventura pero Syberia y Grim Fandango me parecen geniales...Pero este....en trilogia si dejenme decirle que es una farsa...Ni se les ocurra comprar este juego... Necesita quicktime...y consiste en hacer click sobre imagenes y estan van cambiando...acercandose, no hay sensación de movimiento...aunque dice que tiene vision 360 grados...pero esto no es un juego. Las imagenes son buenas pero es simplemente la superposicion de imagenen al hacer click....noooo que desilución tan gigante."

1,Bad purchase,"The front pieces fly off if the window is open because there is no adhesive to hold them on,,, Do Not Buy"
5,"If You're Reading This, You Own It At Home","Okay, I'm preaching to the converted, why else would you be here, but still, isn't Bob's latest effort just amazing? What a gift for words. His generation's Elvis Costello perhaps? Damn, Bob's making fine use of his voice as well. The backing band rocks like a well oiled machine. Your toe will tap for 32 minutes as Bob takes you to meet his satanic friends, through his Beatles records, from California to Iowa, and into his bedroom, all the while glancing at his list of ""things to do"". Now if he could just catch a break and get onto the radio."

5,Fantastic ring,This is one sharp looking ring and the quality is outstanding! Well worth the very low price.
1,The premise of this book is completely false!!!,"This book uses a completely false premise assuming that a child gave up music because he had chosen the wrong instrument when in fact he probably had a bad teacher (there are many ways, reasons why a teacher could be a bad teacher!)VERY DANGEROUS BOOK TOO AS IT COULD CONVINCE YOU, AFTER SOME TIME, THAT THIS FALSE PREMISE IS TRUE!IT COULD EVEN CONVINCE YOU FURTHER TO CHANGE TO A CHEAPER INSTRUMENT IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BUY A MORE EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENT THAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LIKE TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY."
5,Love the book - fantastic pop ups,"This is one of the best pop-up books I've seen. I found illustrations absolutely gorgeous and the pop-ups extremely detailed, but delicate. My daughter (3 years old) loves the book. The story is not long and is fun and easy to read. The the pop-ups though is another story, they kept both my daughter and I captivated for ages.This book is a must for young readers."
5,What a wonderful Book,We are enjoying how the story comes alive with the pop-up pictures. We read iit with our granddaughters and they are intigued by the format of the pages. A timeless classic!
3,. . .Wrinkled Knees,"The pop-ups were amazing, I was surprised at the number of pop-ups and the side-bars.Feel the weight of the paper was too light for a book of this type, let alone a childrens classic.One would like to have a book like this last through many, many readings."
5,Pop-up Raggedy Ann Book is a Delight!,"I love pop-up books and who doesn't love Raggedy Ann & Andy? This is a beautiful book! The illustrations are gorgeous and the whole book is fascinating for adults and children mature enough to understand that the pop-up pages need to be handled carefully if you are to enjoy the book for a long, long time. I predict that it will become a family favorite in your home just as it is in mine. I bought the first copy for me but I have purchased several others to give as gifts and they have always been deeply appreciated by adult book lovers and children alike. It really is worth every penny . . ."
4,"Raggedy Ann & Andy, Camel with the Wrinkled Knees","I would give this book all 5 stars except that I was a little mislead by the info. I was looking for the original hard cover book. The one I had as a kid. I am not sure if it is still in print though. That being said, I actually was pleasantly surprised with this hard cover pop-up book. I don't think they left anything out and is the whole story. My boys REALLY enjoyed the pop-up pages. It is a very creative way to tell a story and keeps the attention of my 2.5 yr old. The story is wonderful told and very imaginative. I am looking forward to buying many more Raggedy Ann & Andy books!"
2,Didn't last,"I returned my first unit because it arrived with a broken plastic tray top. Then the cheap tabs on the replacement broke within weeks. This tool worked pretty well for the first few hundred rounds, then it started to mis-feed and jam all the time.I would not purchase another."
2,"misleading photo, not nearly as good as the older version","The photo and description seem to indicate that this item is the original ""old-style"" or round Lee AutoPrime but it is not, it is the XR square cheaply constructed replacement. I was hoping for the round original, I should have cross referenced the part number. This square model is probably on par with my RCBS version but not nearly as good as the original round. Image is misleading by seller and there is a restocking fee if you were seeking the round model as well."
2,misleading photo,"Your listing provides a picture of the older model Lee hand primer, The model number is for the new model, I ordered two because I prefer the old model and had hoped that the vendor had old stock. Yep I didn't cross check the model number so thats my bad, not putting in a new picture that accurately represents your product in a digital era where such changes are instant and almost cost free, your bad."
3,Auto Primer,I haven't had a chance to use it because Does not accept RBCS bullet holders. I didn't notice it required this when I purchased it and was not in the Directions that it did not accept RCBS Bullet Holders. Would Have been nice I f that was known at time of Purchase.Also the return Spring is weak and does not return the handle very well and consistently.
2,Buy something else,"The new style with the square trays do now work well and are very hard to prime. You can't get a feel as to whether the primer is seated. Primers often pop out of the hole in the plastic cover, jamming the feeding. The old style with the round trays were great."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS BOOK. BUT THE FACT THIS BOOK REALLY TOP THE CONTINUE OF THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. IT SENT ME ON SO MAY EMOTIONS WITH THE CHILDREN THAT PLAYED THE ROLE, BEST FRIENDS, AND FAMILY THAT CAME TOGETHER TO BUILT A FOUNDATION. TO OVERCOME THE EVIL THAT CAME ALONG."
4,Excellent Sequel,"I enjoyed this follow-up to The Root of All Evil. Ms. Jossel kept her character's interesting and ""real"". She allows you into the lives of characters that become alive to the reader. The story begins with the character's dealing with Klarke Taylor's wrongful imprisonment. The story takes you through her family and friends journey as they struggle without her presence, to her release.The ending delivers both just and unjust rewards for all involved.This story has it all,love suspense,humor,retribution and justice. The author ties up all the subplots quite well. I gave this book four out of five stars, because of the bittersweet ending for one of the characters. I am a fan of Ms. Jossel's and will continue to read her books and poems."
3,9v batteries bulk pack,"The cost for these batteries was certainly very advantageous. However, the connecting posts seem to be off slightly. The female connector seemed to be overly tight and it was difficult to fit onto the postof the adapter. However, the male pin seemed to be too small and it would come out of the female on the adapter. I had to use pliers to squeeze shut the adapter female and even then the connection was not very tight. I believe the batteries are slightly different than is the standard. I do not know what the longevity will be as I have just received the battery"
1,Absolute Garbage!,"I bought these thinking, yeah, they're not Duracell or Energizer, or even Rayovac...but they can't be that much different, right?! Wrong! I thought this was a good opportunity to buy a 12 pack and replace all the smoke detector batteries in my house. Most of which are still on their original Duracell batteries that they came with when I bought the house 5 years ago. So, after replacing all, everything was fine, for a day. Then one started chirping, that annoying sound they make when they have a low battery. I thought, oh well, one bad one...so I replaced it. Then a couple days later, another, then another...etc. I don't know if I simply got a bad batch or what, but out of the 7 or 8 I replaced, only one is still functioning 3 MONTHS LATER!!!"
2,Poor storage life,"I bought a bunch of these batteries less than two years ago. When I recently installed them in smoke alarms recently, I noticed that they seemed to be dead. Five of the sealed package units had open circuit voltages of less than 5 volts. Something degraded inside these batteries. The expiration date (best by) was 02/2014."
2,Not great,"Really quite liked Mark's first and second albums, but this one doesn't do it for me. Why?It's the songs I think. They're either depressing, a little embarrassing, or just boring. It isn't enough, on the third album, to still be working out all those past hurts so explicitly. It comes over as whining, not confession. It's not universal. And when Mark does attempt to be upbeat, he borders on the trite. I found it really hard to pick out much of a melody in most of the songs on this album - they just kind of drift along aimlessly.I'm sure he's a fun guy to see live. It's not so much fun to sit and listen to this CD."
1,they would've been better models,"sure, on the cover of the cd they look very ""pretty"" but when it comes to singing it is horrible. The instruments they used were messed up. my very favorite piece in pirates of penzance is ""I am the very model of a modern major general"" and somehow they managed to mess that up too. the people who sing this are either out of tune or they are singing too slowly. If you want to hear real and good pirates of penzance than i suggest getting the older version (the one with a drawing on it).when it comes to an opera (especially gilbert and sullivan operas) looks can not be everything . Being able to sing is a must."
2,Good quality,"This is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe. The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow. If you are going for looks only...they are good. If you want any kind of foot comfort...skip it!"
2,Cute but not comfortable,"I just got my pair of sandals.I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying. Although very cute and trendy sandles, but are very uncomfortable."
2,"Great, if you like dead.","Amazing that you can orders these online, but it died within 3 weeks. I took care of it just like they said to. It makes a nice dead Bonzi, but that's not really what I had in mind."
1,Not what was advertised,"When the tree - a gift - arrived, I was thrilled. It is absolutely gorgeous. However, I soon realized that it is a tree that MUST be kept outdoors. The main description on Amazon did NOT say this - I had to read the detailed description. Because there are dozens of bonzais to look at on Amazon, I must have skipped over this. Now, I have a gift for someone who would LOVE to have a bonzai, but who lives in an apartment so cannot keep it outdoors. I'm incredibly disappointed. The problem is not with the quality of the tree, which is wonderful. The problem is with Amazon's description, which has left me in the lurch just a few days before I had to give it as a gift."
3,size seemed off,"I have previoulsy owned a Gymnic (now Fitball) birth ball and loved it. This one, however, seemed to be the wrong size! We carefully marked the wall where it should inflate to, and when we got to about 55 cm, it was already very tight and hard. we decided to continue pumping to about 65 cm, and it was so hard, it was very uncomfortable to sit on. I suspect that fitball was sent the wrong size by the company that manufactures these for them. I will be sending this ball back and ordering the next size up, because I really do want a birth ball, and the burst resistant quality is important to me."
4,Great DVD! Like always!,"I love Yu Yu Hakusho, and as soon as this came out I bought it!There is ONLY ONE FLAW on this DVD though. If you perfer to watch it in Japanese with Subtitles, they messed the subtitles up on ""Yoko's Magic"" (a.k.a. ""A Desparate Kurama: A final Measure""), so the first half of the episode has the introduction subtitle stuck at the bottom of the screen. This is the ONLY reason why it lost a star from me. But to be really honest, if you watch the English version, then go back and watch the Japanese, it doesn't make a lot of difference ^_^The final round, the fight between Team Urameshi and Team Tugoro, is finally beginning, and the battle between Karasu and Kurama is the most beautiful fight in the world, so this is still definately worth buying. Don't miss out on this great action in Yu Yu Hakusho!"
3,Important Questions -- Please Help!!,"Did anyone else who opened their uncut dvd case get a dvd disc with a picture of Kurama (that matches the picture on the edited dvd case) on it? I suspect that this is the edited dvd disc erroneously inserted inside the dvd case for the uncut (unedited) version. Did anyone get the usual blue dvd disc with the word uncut on it? If you did get the blue disc will you please post what distribution center it came from? The disc that I suspect is actually the edited version inside the uncut (unedited) dvd case came from the Kentucky distribution center. From one Yu Yu Hakusho fan to another, I just want to get the item I ordered and paid for, so please post any information that will help. Thanks!!"
5,"Obsessed fan girl! This rocks, Holla!","I found this originally at Walmart on my dad's b-day after they stopped playing it on Cartoon Network and went to the old ones. This rocks! Yoko Kurama is so cold, yet so hot! Kurama is like my favorite character! His plants in this are so freakishly awesome! Karasu is mega freaky! I think he has a thing for Kurama! (And this is dubbed!) If I knew this was coming out sooner, I would have gotten uncut! But this is also awesome! If you're my age, this is probably what you are looking for if you aren't allowed to get uncut yet even though I do. This is a must have for any Yu Yu Hakusho fan or their collection! You'll never get tired of it but it's ending is shocking! If you can't figure it out at the end, just buy the next one, Sword and Dragon, which rocks! Even dubbed! I know cause I own it! Buy this one! Holla!"
2,Sad and Gory,Ok girls who love Kurama will not like this episode. I assure all of you that before you watch take a box of kleenex and try to hear anyone heard you cry or see tears in your eyes. This episode is very depressing for Kuramalovers. Please be aware of this.
3,2 Expensive 4 *3* Episodes!,"Sorry, but after seeing the other Yu Yu Hakusho DVDs... *crying* This one kind of [stunk]!!! And I'm a BIG fan of YYH!!!It only has three episodes on it, and one of them is transition! If you want to pay [more money] for a transition episode and only TWO battle episodes, [T_T like I did!!!] then this DVD is right for you! But otherwise... if you're really desperate... buy a used one so it doesn't cost you as much."
1,Majestic branding makes this unwearable for any serious fan,"My brother is a die-hard Red Sox fan. Not a die-hard Majestic Red Sox fan. No self-respecting fan would wear a t-shirt where the corporate logo of the manufacturer gets equal billing with the team name. Too bad Major League Baseball didn't impress this fact on their vendors when they licensed out their team logos.But hey, there's plenty of other Red Sox merchandise out there. I'll buy that instead. Way to go MLB and Majestic. Your marketing departments should be fired."
5,((((((((((((((((((((((((((O))))))))))))))))))))))))) Lordy!,"I am listening to the song ""Bremerton"" that is available on the double-album version. If you are a collector of their vinyl, it's worth getting, but certainly not for this song. I would much rather listen to ""Grimm and Bear It"".Of all the Sunn recordings, I believe this to be their best. ""Flight of the Behemoth"" is huge, as is ""00 Void"" but this is the one currently on heavy rotation. Lately I can't get enough of this genre, whatever it is we call it. earth2, Boris ""Absolutego"" and all the Sunn stuff has taken me down the path of spiritual awakening. This is sound that move the soul, moreso than any other form of music.I must be doing something right, since my 16 year old daughter thinks her dad's music is loud and obnoxious."
3,curiosity put the cat in a deep sleep,"I am a devoted fan of experimental cutting edge music. Anderson and O'Malley are riding the wave of some admirable wild innovation. They are interesting individuals and I will continue to follow my curiosity with their projects.With that being said I keep falling asleep to Sunn albums; this one in particular. The album featuring Merzbow on 2 tracks is better in my opinion. I haven't heard Altar yet, so that one stands as my pick of the Sunn stack."
2,You Wanna Know What This Sounds Like?,"BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzZzZZZZZZZZZSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... and so on. All 4 songs are a super low distorted buzz. Seriously. Nothing else happens. Each song is 15 minutes + too. Yeah, this album gets two stars because it's hilarious."
4,Beauty From The Troubled Mind of Roky.,These stripped down versions of some of Erickson's greatest songs should be heard by the curious and owned by any true fan of Roky and the Aliens or the 13th Floor Elevators. A live album that does not disappoint.
4,Linda goes New Wave,"She got some fairly bad reviews for Mad Love as I recall. It doesn't matter. This is a great CD to take in Ronstadt's immense range. She does a beautiful job with all the material, much of it ear candy. My faves: ""Girl Talk"", ""Look Out For My Love"" and ""I Can't Let Go"". If you enjoy the writing of Elvis Costello and Neil Young, the backing vocals of Nicollette Larson and the genius of Peter Asher, this is your kind of music."
2,Great Album Badly Recorded,"This is an album I loved on LP back in the Eighties. I bought it with great anticipation, but beware the ""Bargain Series"" sticker on the front. ""Bargain"", in this context, appears to mean, ""We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you!""This is an AAD disk, which means that the original analog master was simply digitized. A better process is ADD, whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk. Regardless, there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD. It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have. I can't recommend it."
5,Great!,"Linda's foray into 'New Wave' music came as no surprise to me. As I have said in an earlier review, she can sing anything she wants, and here is excellent proof. Here she covers Elvis Costello's ""Party Girl,"" and ""Girls Talk,"" and both are great! The Tracks: ""How do I make you"" and ""I Can't Let Go"" show off her powerful voice; but they are significant also because the late Nicolette Larson (who used to sing back-up for Neil Young) sings back-up. It is also not surprising that Linda also covers a Neil Young song, ""Look Out For My Love"" too. Another great Ronstadt CD!"
2,I could hardly make it to the end,"While I agree that this poor woman has been treated terribly by both the press and the Royal Family, this book was so whiny I could hardly get to the end. Practically every sentence contains some self-berating statement. While she says at the end that she has overcome, the book doesn't read that way."
3,It would be a lot more pleasant to read if.....,"Fergie didn't keep beating up on herself. Low self-esteem pervades throughout this book. That being said, I don't think Fergie has a very realistic appraisal of her situation. She's the mother of practically nothing, as far as the monarchy is concerned, and Diana was the mother of the future heir. Of course Diana is going to get better treatment."
5,The dust collector really does work!,"I've just finished sanding an old oak door with my new little makita sander and I am impressed. I believe the material removal is about average, the unit has a very good 'quality' feel to it, and the dust collector seems to collect almost all of the dust created (I am sanding horizontally, don't know if that makes a difference or not right now.)"
5,Your Guide to Operating a Computer-Based Business at Little or No Cost!,"I received it in a timely manner. It includes lots of infomation in a condensed, concise format. It is very helpful and necessary for all businesses. Excellent Job! (Thumbs Up!)"
5,I can NOT believe they don't sell this stuff in the stores! :(,Gives you a fake glow that looks like you were born with it! I like the pink light for my skin... the golden is a little to dark for me. But it is still pretty!Wish they still sold it at walmart! :(
1,Why would I share this beauty secret?,I finally find a beauty advantage and you expect me to tell the world?Dream on.
4,Makeup,I love the product. Shipping took longer than expected. But I have ordered from this company before and usually get things very quickly. I will buy from this vendor again.
2,Revlon Golden Light,I love the product and use it instead of makeup but this shade is way too dark for anyone to wear comfortably. If worn by itself it would look like a brown mask. I do blend just a very small amount with the lightest shade and it works.
1,!!!!!! DONT BUY THAT ITEM !!!!!,"!!!!!! DONT BUY THAT ITEM !!!!!Looks like things are very slow at this point, that item was already flaged awith a very bad review from Joey at May 12, 2010.Nothing was done to fix that until my purchase of that item on December 01, 2010, even after I have asked customer service representatives to fix it.Maybe nobody cares.I was refunded twice as a mistake for that item. More issues on the system.I have received that item and is just a very unknown fastethernet switch, its better to buy something that you can trust more like a cisco/linksys or a dlink or netgear or any other thing, you can get one for less that that.Maybe a gig switch for sure that one isnt one of those.It is saying that is a 48 ports console server. BUT THE TRUE IS THAT THIS IS A 12 PORT 100 MBPS UNMANAGED SWITCH."
2,Misleading,"I agree with the others who gave a poor review. My husband agreed to try and learn to dance, but after seeing how 70's this was, he reneged on his promise. I believe we could have learned to dance but this was so out-of date (made in 20043 but filmed in the 70's) he just said ""no way."""
2,dance vid,My hubby is not a dancer...but this vid was really tooo basic. save your money on this one
2,Invitation to Dance....but I don't wanna.,"This DVD was not what I was expecting. Like the other reviewers say (which I read after the purchase, silly me), the cover looks modern, yet the acutal instructors and dancers look like they're caught in the eighties. The couple instructing the video took the opportunity to include as much footage of their own wedding (not dancing!) as footage of dance instructions. They also look miserable while dancing together! In the end of each dance I thought they would pull all the steps together to show you how the final product looks, but they didn't. For the price I paid, I'm not terribly upset, but I do feel that the modern cover is a little misleading."
1,horribly outdated,"This video is very misleading. It shows a younger couple on the front very modern looking, copywrite 2003, then when you watch it, everything is from the 80's from way outdated dance steps. I can't see anyone under 80 dancing to these dances."
2,Out of Date and Misleading,I completely agree with the other review.The cover of the DVD has a younger/modern couple.However the video itself is from the early 90's - seems like 80's though! VERY outdated. You'll know it as soon as the 1st scene!!!
5,Good for babies.,"My one-year-old loves looking at the children's faces in this book. It's a solid, one piece book, so it's harder for the kids to rip apart. Highly recommended."
3,Nothing special,This book is literally a book of baby faces. There is a baby face on top of some funky background. My daughter never really enjoyed looking at this book. I would not buy this item again.
3,Fun book.,"Fun book. Baby faces on both sides, opens up into one long piece. One side is happy babies and the other is crying babies."
2,not interesting,"My 10 month old didn't find this interesting at all. She loves books in general and can usually be found flipping through one, but she hasn't touched baby faces."
5,This CD is great! Here's what I think about it:,"To rate this, i'm going to use a rating system with 1 being the lowest, 5 being the average, and 10 being the highest.1. Father and Daughter-9/102. Iwoya-10/103. Dance With Us-10/104. Animal Nation-5/105. Happy-9.5/106. Motla Le Pula(The Rainmaker)-5/107. Monkey Man-10/108. Don't Walk Away-7/109. Acci-Dent-9.5/1010. End of Forever-8/1011. Shaking the Tree(O2 Remix)-8.5/1012. Get Out of London-7.5/1013. Africa-5/1014. Awa Awa-5/10Just listen to that song ""Monkey Man."" It's more than good. It's so great. Also ""Iwoya"" and ""Dance With Us"" are as good as Monkey Man. The really good songs are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Anyone think they're really good?Grade: A+What that means: BUY IT AT ALL COSTS, OK?"
4,Put These on the Radio Please?,"I listen to this sequence 1,2,7,8,9,12 and 14; and repeat it because this is by far some of the best music from 2002 we can listen to forever.2003 Still kickin it up! Buy this disc and have a happy day. It's sort of a King Sunny Ade' feel with cool vocals and rhythms and bass. Oh, by-the-way, the rest of the cd is hip too. And Sting is un-mistakable, Paul Simon is Me and Hulio meets Graceland. Dave Mathews' acoutic style will have you wanting more; and by-far the best Reel Big Fish, ska tune and the Baja Men are killer on Accident. Awa Awa by Wes is true to heart and the Pretenders tune is a surprise and more! Buy this soundtrack and call your local dj to play this on the radio."
3,Balderash!! Not His Best,A few good tracks but who can stand to listen again to Cats In The Cradle? Talk about a song that radio killed. My least favorite of his albums.
4,Cats in the Cradle is my favorite!,Cats in the Cradle is the best song! My sisters and I have loved this song since we were very small. I am buying this cd just so I can have Cats in the Cradle played at my wedding reception! I can't wait to see my dad's face when I play it for him! Thanks Harry!
4,Nice book for Rain Fans.,"If you are familiar with the Railroad Color History series, then this book is pretty much the same as the others. I enjoyed the many shots of the Rio Grande tackling the Rocky Mountains. The history of the railroad is superbly written and the photos are very well done. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Rio Grande or railroads in general."
5,Exciting Australian Shipwreck sets the scene,"This book was my second read from E. V. Timms and I found it fast moving and exciting. The characters were great and some were recognised from one of her earlier books. This is early pioneering Australia in a time that the country was just starting out. A wonderful tale that would make a good movie. The old sea Captain with his barnacles and the various other survivors of the ""accident at sea"" set the tone for the book. A good, fun and interesting read. If you have ever visited Australia or read of the early days of this country you will enjoy this book."
4,Functiion & Good looks,I have installed now 5 of these in kitchens for rental units and private use only. I have nothing bad to say except for the hot and cold control button on top of the head. The color coding fades very quickly. Along the joint of faucet body and hose assembles hard water and other residue easily and is a bit awkward to clean. But a small brush works pretty well. Otherwise I find the faucet to be a true work horse. Nothing to brag about but very functional and attractive.
3,kinda cheap,"Corners are cut in the construction. Mostly through the use of plastic parts instead of metal. Not minor parts either but major ones such as having a snap on plastic connector for the water lead in hose instead of brass threaded connectors, not secure connection but doesn't leak. Even the retractable hose for the pullout faucet was plastic instead of braided steel mesh. This concerned me because the sink cutout has sharp metal edges and turning the spigot back and forth would cause the plastic to be cut rather easily. I remedied this by using duct tape to cover edges and left some tape stick towards the center so that the hose was pushed away from the edges. Bad/cheap design definately not ment to last. Color coded water temp indicator is not flush with handle. It appears popped out but I can not push it back in, ugly. I can even see some sort of hex screw shape indentation on other side the gap is so big. But it was cheap and came with soap dispenser that was why I bought it."
2,Sprung a leak after less than 4 months,"The top part of the faucet has sprung a leak after less than 4 months of non-abusive regular use. I plan to call soon to inquire on warranty replacement and will edit this review with how they respond. I can't recommend this faucet as of right now though, spending more money for something better looks to be the safer route.-Update: The faucet was still under warranty and they sent a replacement part, but the same issue still exists again less than a year later. This is just not a great product. Decent enough for the low price, but not a steal by any means."
4,perfect gift book,"I was deeply moved by DEAR LITTLE ONE and bought several more copies for couples I know who just had a baby or are having one soon. This is a perfect gift book, but more than that, because the reflections will last a lifetime. Nice black and white photography, too."
3,Nice and Wide,"The straws are nice and wide as stated, however they stated the length as 8 standard. We had 2 other people measure them and they were actually 7 and 7/8 and had slanted bottom which we thought the standard bottom would be flat. Not what we were looking for, contacted them, got a response right away, sent them back and are currently awaiting the refund. This was a great buy since you got 50 in the package. The ones I ended up getting from another place had far fewer straws in the package and cost more."
2,Disappointed,"I know that he is a very good guitar player, but the selection of the songs he chose was disappointing to me."
3,good price for decent product,"good to protect the screen, but a couple of pieces of lint are stuck under the protector, and I can't get it off. But it works."
4,Good product,Offers good screen protection. Easy to install. But does not fit perfectly on the 8120. The area around the trackball is slighlty raised. The protector cannot stick correctly in that area. Not a problem so far.
3,stiff plastic doesn't form to the curves of the screen,"I applied the screen protector and the install process was great - they really made it easy with the tabs and film protecting everything. A very well packaged and user-friendly product. My issue is with the fitment, and although I still use it, I wish it was better. The screen of the Pearl is not flat, and the hard plastic used does not contour to the screen. The edges on the left and right sides have about 1/32""-1/16"" airspace under the edges, and around the track ball there is even more. This product applied easily, and serves the purpose, but it does not look as clean as I had hoped. Considering its functionality, I will continue using it until I find a better product."
1,Bad experience,"I have gone back and read the other customer reviews, and therefore will contend that perhaps this was ""user error."" BUT, for the record, I am an educated, mechanically inclined professional, and my screen protector went straight from package to phone to garbage! So, I am not so sure that I would say that applying this is without issue for everyone. I would recommend buying more than one so you don't potentially end up like me, still with an unprotected screen and out my penny + shipping!"
1,"Cheap, but ineffective","Thought I would try the cover, as I was buying some related things. It really is not a ""robust"" design, as it was pulling up in the corners rather quickly. Perhaps some trimming would help, but I doubt it. I have no ill feelings towards the product....you get what you pay for though."
2,Not shaped well,"I'm not too fond of this screen protector. It certainly covers the whole front of the display, but because the Blackberry front has a slight curve, it doesn't fit well. The edges curl up.So - I grabbed some sharp scissors and cut down the protector so that it fits just the actual display area. The protector fits much better now and only curls up on the edges slightly.It does the job, but looks like there's a piece of plastic stuck on the front. I used to have a protector that was of the same type - silicon - but it fit a lot better. Basically, it was a smaller size. I'd suggest if you need a protector, get one of the smaller ones."
1,dont buy this!,don't buy this eforcity screen protector. it scratched my NEW blackberry pearl 8130. it also removed a bit of the black coating on the blackberry pearls display. the phone was brand new. now it looks like a refurbished unit! there was no invoice/receipt included with the order either. be very wary of this company. i await a refund on my bank card.
1,Hasn't arrived yet !!,"Ordered the product several weeks ago for 87cents and hasn't arrived. For 87cents not worth the trouble to check on, but will not order again !!"
3,Not as pictured,"The screen cover I received is smaller than what is pictured in the image. It does not cover the Blackberry Logo or extend to the grey part of the ""screen"" below the actual LCD. It is EXACTLY the size of the viewable screen, so if you misalign by even a tiny bit, part of your screen will not be protected. Also not the easiest screen protector to apply, and I've used several.Adheres well, though."
4,Great product,"This is a great product for anyone who wants to protect their phone. Its cheap and fits great, to a point. What others have said about the air gap at the top is true, the film is not pliable enough to contour properly to the phone's face. But with that said, its still a great and simple product that does what it says."
1,Not happy,"Shipped fast, right protector for phone but I could not get rid of the air bubbles. Could not see a thing with this product covering my screen. Possibly I could not get it on properly (even though I did my sisters Samsung Eternity right)."
1,Spicy World Mung Dal,"I didn't like this product because is not organic, I was looking for organic Mung dal. will be great if yo have organic Mung Dal."
5,A Practical Reference to Steam Turbines - Must have for the Industrial Practitioner,"The starting point to select, install, operate or control specific Machinery is to learn and understand about its principles and technology. I am an Electronics Engineer, but I have been working for the last 16 years as an Instrumentation, Automation and Process Safety and Control Engineer for the Oil and Gas Industries. As a result I have been involved with Chemical and Mechanical Engineering issues related with both gas and steam turbines in a day to day basic. This handy reference has proven most useful and time saving when in need of information or a shortcut to solve problems.This ""quick-reference"" guide offers you authoritative information on the operating characteristics, efficiencies, design features, reliability, and maintenance of Steam Turbines. Absolutely a must have if you work with steam turbines."
3,Great CD for Blues Clues Fans,"My son loves Blues Clues and can't get enough of this CD. It features songs from different Blues Clues videos and music CDs. The only thing is that it only has eight songs that go by really fast when you're listening to it in the house or in the car. Then my son wants to start it over and hear them all againwhich means we hear these same songs twice as often as a CD with more songs. But it is a pretty cheap CD so I guess it is worth it for my son, but unless your kid really loves Blues Clues it probably isn't worth buying since it is so short."
5,Ah Nostalgia!,"I had the delightful opportunity of seeing John play and sing in Santa Monica in the early 80's. He was the act before an a famous Irish Ballad Singer, but after listening to him perform for a good hour and a half, no one and I mean no one could have follwed this guys act. His musicianship and amazing talent for picking up and playing anything with strings and not to mention his voice was an instrument unto itself, was sheer joy. He was sellng his tapes (pre CD's) out in the lobby after the show and I bought Winter Solstice.I was so hooked! I even went to a guitar teacher and asked her to teach me how to play ""Christmas in the Trenches"" which is still a favorite I bring out during the holidays. This CD is worth it's weight in gold for the charismatic energy John brings to each song. A must have for all ages to enjoy."
5,Beautiful and eclectic collection of touching holiday music.,"This a really wonderful holiday collection of songs that will touch every heart, young and old. We received it as a present several years ago; and it has become a family favorite. Just beautiful. One you will not want to put away."
5,Winter SOlstice,This album is one of my husband's all time favorites. We have owned the audio tape for years. I just recently became aware that it has been digitized and the sound quality improved. We love the instrumentals and quality of performance. There isn't a bad song on the entire album.
1,Doesn't travel well,Doesn't travel well. Poorly packaged spindle opened in transit and about half the discs were trashed due to scratching. The 5 or 6 I've used so far burned fine but if I buy this brand again it will be from a local store.
2,Wilton Vice,"Pretty cheap construction, Saddly Wilton has sold their souls to China also. It is of standard made in China Poor Quality."
5,New Vise,"The vise turned out exactly as described. It is not a heavy duty vise, but is a nice medium duty. It is perfect for handyman."
5,No surprizes,"Well made and exactly what I wanted. Sometimes the picture of the product can deceive, but not this time. The accessories to pad the clamping faces are a good addition."
4,Home Shop Vice,The product is what it says it is. Haven't used mine real hard yet but so far its operated flawlessly.
3,I had high hopes.,"I would say..average on this. Don't expect anything to profound. A broad subject like this is hard to cover in one small book. I felt like it was a good overview. Don't expect any specific advice. The book does a good job of over viewing the different types of lures used, fish species, and the different environments in which to find those species. If you are fishing in a particular part of the county and want some direct advice on how to fish that particular area this book won't help you."
5,THE LION THE WITCH & THE WARDROBE SPECIAL EDITION,"I grew up with this cartoon and had a lot of good memories watching it. I couldn't find this cartoon anywhere, so I had to order it and ordering it on amazon.com was a good choice because it came really quickly. I always loved the chronicles of narnia and always will.This cartoon rock!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Disappointing quality, but good DB episodes","I just purchased this DVD set, and I thought it average. Of course I would only watch the subbed Japanese version, and I was disappointed both with the grainy picture quality and the sound quality (which is in mono, not stereo). Some of the subs were off, and there were a few misspellings (like ""alright"" instead of ""All right"" or ""earned"" instead of ""learned""). In one episode in particular, I found that the subbers were pulling an old (and annoying) Funimation trick - replacing the original dialogue with their own creation (like putting in ""Man!"" or ""Totally radical!""). The overall quality, though, is better than the 45 MB fansubbed episodes I had downloaded awhile back, which is why I purchased this DVD set. The ""extras"" are nothing to write home about, but I was interested in the actual episodes anyways."
3,"not near as good as part 2, still okay though","this dvd does not have any heated battles, the sound is not all that great and animation is a bit crumbly, but that is because it was originally made in the 80's. everybody grows up in this dvd, which saves it from a 2 out of 5. but it is DB and the story is okay. part 2 is way better."
4,Mr.Popo! Oh my Kami!!,"This dvd is a very interesting one. It is not really a saga because it mostly talks about Goku,Krillen,Yamcha,Tien, and Chatozou's training (Forgive if spelled wrong). The best part of this dvd is Mr.Popo,Kami, and everyone's favorite guy, Piccolo(In this dvd he is known as Juniour.) Goku's training is pretty funny to watch. The all time greatest battle of Dragonball is also in this dvd. No, even better than Goku vs. Red Ribbon Army! Goku versus....... Chi Chi!!!!!!! If you are a true fan to dragonball own this dvd!!!!!!!!!"
5,A new begianing,This is the saga were dragon ball starts to turn into dragon ball z becuse everyone grows up.Anyway the saga starts out with everyone meating for the wrold tournamet untill they realize that king piccolos son piccolo is thare and has his sights on goku to kill him.Not only that gokus friends are thare we also get to see chi chi genral tao and some new fighters.Thare are not alot of really strong battles in here but thare are some godd fights still.The thing that was kinda bad was most of the humor was gone which made me a little disaponited.Anyway this still chould have been a better saga but it is still good.
3,Worth checking out for the tie-in with DBZ but not worth 40$,"The episodes that you will want to check out are the first four and the last four of the collection. They feature the first appearances of Kami, Mr. Popo, Ma Jr.(Piccolo of DBZ), Cyborg Tao-Pi-Pi and even Goku's proposal to Chi Chi. They also feature the 23rd World Tournament, which features the long awaited Goku vs. Piccolo fight. However, the other half of the two-disc set is filled with pointless filler episodes(something the original Dragonball is notorious for) that do not add at any all to the experience of the important ones. Also, the quality does not seem nearly as good as Funimation's other DVDs, which can also detract from the experience. Overall, while a devoted DBZ fan will want to check this out, I recommend finding it at a discount place or borrowing these from a friend, but don't go wasting $40."
4,Rita,"Oh yeah, Finally found some. Had fallen for that dish every since I went to a dinner party at some friends. Tried lots of stores but couldn't find any. Just for fun, one day typed in on amazon and there it was. Ha ha. Very nice"
2,Red Lentils not like India,"I don't know that much about lentils, but these do not taste like the ones I used to buy in India and Mauritius, so I'm disappointed."
1,Stumbling between art and artifice,"In Joni's early work, I was amazed at her ability to cloak wonderful, accessible messages and a dreamy, passionate world within her songs and the lyrics, and was yet fun-loving. She was a wonder, from Clouds, Song to a Seagull through For the Roses and Blue....some good bits on Hissing, Court and Spark, and Hejira. I try not to be closed-minded about artistic evolution (all my favorite artists do it); but here is little discernible effort at the craft of songwriting as I understand it. No rhythm, no melody, mainly just sadness and a sense of hystrionics. When I bought this decades ago, I feared Los Angeles had finally destroyed her. I have heard a few tracks of her work since this album, and it seems true.Now, for all the people that give this such great reviews, I wonder if they really find it likable enough to play often and return to. If so, that's great. My ears can't imagine it."
4,Awesome,"I have never heard joni before this... well, i know she is usually singing slow songs where the focus is all on her voice... but i decided to try this album out and really like it alot... the music is very interesting and the melodies and words are quite good. i listen to it with astral weeks, blonde on blonde, grace, and sketches of spain... it holds up to that company very well!"
2,Just doesn't do it for me,"I was such a huge fan of Joni's in the 1970s; 'Hejira' remains on my top ten all-time favorite album list (by anyone). 'Don Juan' really sank things for me back in 1978, and I hadn't listened to it probably 20 years. But I've been going through a Joni renaissance lately so I got the CD and figured I must have written it off too early. Sad to say, I think I was right the first time. It rambles and preaches and is almost completely lacking in melody. It has much more to do with 'Mingus' than 'Hejira' or 'Hissing.' I can see the ambition in 'Paprika Plains,' but it commits a cardinal sin in my book - it's just boring. I never cared much for her Geffen stuff, and unfortunately this is really the first salvo - a lot of it is formless and self-indulgent. I'm all for an artist evolving - Joni is the great example of that - but this one is going to the used CD store, and I am going to forget about it all over again."
1,A Failed Experiment,"AS a avid Joni Mitchell fan I always looked forward to every album she released. For me, the lady could do no wrong. After all, she created such masterworks as, "" Blue"" and ""Court & Spark"". But, this album left me confused and cold. There was no passion, only failed musical experiments. The songs go nowhere. Their messages are unclear and esoteric. Joni was, I suppose, trying to expand her muse, but in the process created a artistic mess. The title cut is the only saving grace on this double album. Double album? A little indulgent of the lady I must say. This album foreshadowed her 80s and 90s failures."
2,A great pimp,"I really can't get into this album, but the cover is the best. Joni makes a very convincing pimp, and has all the moves. She can protect me anytime."
1,The Ultimate Feel Good Party Album,"This album is so light and accessible, perfect music to be listening to as you cruise along the beach, with the top down on your car. I promise you with one listen, you'll be humming along with a big smile on your face, marvelling at Joni's brevity and economy as a composer and wordsmith, in awe of how she can resist the temptation to create pretensious and longwinded songs that one could listen to a million times, but still never truly understand and enjoy. Thank you so much Joni, you've created the ultimate party record."
4,Madness!,"I love this album. Joni Mitchell seems to have followed her instincts into some strange, dark, obsessive place and I am, sometimes, willing to follow her there. Yes, this album can be hard to digest, but there are times when the title track is stuck in my head and only a sledgehammer could dislodge it. I think Joni Mitchell would be a difficult but fascinating friend. For the record, we are not friends. I am difficult, too, but less talented."
5,A Weird and Infinitely Compelling Read,"""Secret Dead Men"" is in a realm by itself.When I picked up this book, I literally couldn't imagine where the author would take me from one page to the next. Swierczynski creates this odd afterlife (not the kind learned at church) and forces the reader to emotionally invest into the whacky characters and their plights.Set in Philadelphia in the seventies, I didn't understand any of his cultural allusions. However, by the end of the novel, I was fully familiar with the Brain Hotel, the soul stealing capabilities of the protagonist, and even had a new appreciation of toilets.This is the kind of book that will make you giddy with the eccentricity of it all... and might make you a tad disappointed in the next book you pick up. But, don't fear... I think the author has another novel coming out soon.If it's anything like ""Secret Dead Men,"" buy it on a long weekend. You'll want to do nothing else!"
4,A fresh and original debut from a promising new talent,"Readers looking for a change from the sameness that plagues so many mysteries are advised to check out the fresh and idiosyncratic debut Secret Dead Men, by Duane Swierczynski.Del Farmer is a P.I., but he doesn't collect clues; he collects the souls of the recently dead, hoping they can help him with his investigations. Of course, they usually don't. Most of the time they just end up causing him trouble.Del is trying to get the goods on an organized crime group known as ""The Association,"" but the harder he digs, the less he seems to know. The souls he keeps stashed away in his mind (in a place he calls the ""Brain Hotel"") are no help either, not even those of the former FBI agent or the mob hit man.If you're starting to suspect that Secret Dead Men is not the ordinary mystery novel, you're right. It is offbeat, quirky and confident, revealing Swierczynski as a talented newcomer."
3,Gets a little boring,"I like my clawhammer banjo music with some vocals. That's why I really wanted ""Fiddle Tunes for the Clawhammer Banjo"" by Carlin, but it's out of print. Thirty tunes of banjo and fiddle start to sound the same and gets a little boring."
4,no problems so far,"I don't know too much about this kind of equipment, but I have been using this on a weekly basis for the past 3 months and haven't had any problems."
5,good,great coupler and works just like it is supposed to. Not connectivity issues and seems to be very durable. Would buy again.
5,Sturdy,"Very sturdy design. I use it to link 2 speaker cables together from time to time as needed, or use it when I want to listen to the stereo across the room, although I get mono (one side only). Not sure why this is. Very helpful 1/4"" extension overall."
3,"PRETTY CREEPY,WORTH TO SEE!!","Not-bad low budget film about a ghost hunter & others investigating a supposedly haunted house. The filmmakers do an admirable job of maintaining a creepy atmosphere throughout even without a lot of money at their disposal. The spfx are decent as is the film score by actor Mike Marsh. There are some negatives, though: the acting is a bit dodgy; one of the characters is so obviously the antagonist that they might as well have showed up wearing a black hat & sporting a twirly black moustache; and the twist ending can be spotted a mile away. All-in-all, this a decent little horror film. C+"
4,A decent indie/guerilla flick,"I wasn't expecting much from this, but it was actually a decent movie. I was interested in the story, the acting didn't get too much in the way. It had a decent ending for this kind of genre. I'm writing this a few months after seeing it and I still favor it. I suggest it to any real ghost fans of the indie/guerilla market."
1,Anti Christian Crap!,Anti Christian propaganda of the worst kind!!Did not appreciate this. I like creepy movies but this was just unnecessary.
1,"Horrible acting, lousy sound, predictable.","It was so obvious to me who ""Mary Young"" was the moment she showed up! Totally ridiculous that the ""ghost hunter"" & crew would find the ""secret stash"" of creepy, pervy pictures, ""brain washing helmet & ""reconditioning room"". The police would've ripped that house apart after the ""murder/suicide"" trying to find anything in the families history that would have led to the ""crime"". It would have been dragged into the media to show the facade that the ""good"" family had. No ""creepy"" moments for me at all. It could have been an interesting story if done right. This however, was so wrong in every way. The ""actors"" were just horrible! Overacting to the point of comedy. Constantly had to adjust the volume, straining to hear what was going on, then blasted with sound the next. Do yourself a favor & skip this one!"
3,Effective low budget chiller,"Presented as ""based on true events"" this low budget chiller actually manages to deliver. Ghost hunter of the title gets paid to investigate haunted house with motley crew in tow, some invited, some not. Assorted ructions ensue and visitors get increasingly strung out.My patience got a little strung out too. The volume dips and spikes wildly depending on who's talking or who was holding the mike that day. It's a nearly fatal flaw. It might also have been better presented as ""lost footage"" like Blair Witch rather than ""based on"" since I can't find any reference to Carter Simms anywhere. Blair Witch carried it off masterfully. This doesn't but all that notwithstanding, it's still worth a look."
2,Good Idea Poorly Executed,"Nice idea. Poorly executed. This film won an award for best screenplay at some indie horror festival. I can see why. The idea is nice but the execution is absolutely horrendous. The acting in particular is really poor. In the hands of a decent film maker, this could be something special. Unfortunately it's not."
2,Low Low budget,"WowOther reviews complained about the sound, yeah it was bad high to low to no sound, but that was the least of the films problems. Horrible acting, bad plot, zero chills................bottom line, F-Joe"
1,This book is the worst book I have read in years.,I think This book has no true facts and it is hundreds of years off
4,Great book,I read this some years ago when it first came out. It was a fascinating read. Now I am trying to buy a copy of my own so I can read it again before I go to Egypt for the first time. I educated and trained as an archaeologist and spent years working in the field. Brian Fagan is a well known archaeologist and a scholar. This book reflects that kind of attention to the facts.
5,Excellent Book with a Most Appropriate Title,"When we think of archaeological excavations today, we think of very slow and careful work. With these modern methods ingrained in our minds, we can only gasp when we read about the methods used in the nineteenth century and earlier. I have read a number of books by this author and this is one of his best. He describes how antiquities were treated in the past - where being a tomb robber in Egypt was reputable and the source of much income for individuals and museums outside of Egypt. The discovery of ancient monuments and artifacts was encouraged by those in power in Egypt only so that they could be presented as gifts to potential allies. Despite this ""rape of the Nile"" that has so tragically taken place on such a large scale in the past, it encouraging to read Dr. Zahi Hawass's comment that only about 30% Egypt's antiquities have been discovered thus far. This book is well written and difficult to put down. I heartily recommend it!"
2,Not for eveyone,"I bought this video after a friend recommended it. Unfortunately, my child will not watch it. I've watched most of it and it is cute for the most part. My child has three Elmo dolls so I thought for sure she'd love it. Guess I was wrong."
5,My toddler LOVES this video,She hasn't caught on that Elmo is trying to teach her about going potty in the potty but she loves watching this video.
4,Elmo is a little dull but usefull,"My daughter is 2 an dpotty training. i bought the dvd and the elmo potty seat together. the dvd did loose my daughters attention rather quickly but she kept hearing the word potty while i let it play and she was very interested on sitting on her ""monster"" potty cahir. the dvd is kinda all over the place and could have used a little more hands on guide as other reviews mentioned. but it instills confidence which is half the battle. Elmo is a little dull and lengthy but ive let toher parents in my preschool class borrow it and they found it somewaht useful as well for 3-4 age group."
2,confusing the little one,"my daughter absolutely adores elmo, but this dvd confused her a bit because while it features her favorite hero of all time the pace & introduction of themes are different than what she's accustomed to with regular episodes of elmo's world.small children are big on having routines, but when you take features they recognize then change the line up, it can throw the kids through a loop.so while i did feel the dvd presented the topic in a fun & educational manner, my daughter just didn't connect because it didn't have the typical elmo song/ask the noodles/ask dorothy/drawer/how can i find out more/end song.but then again every kid is an individual, so maybe your kid will get it or your kid won't."
2,It's OK but not as effective as ones with real kids in it,This DVD is pretty informative about why and how to go potty. But - it drags on and on and I don't think the kids can relate to Elmo as much as the actual kids shown in other poty training DVDs. My son did not even sit through the video while he keeps watching the other one (with real children in it over and over again). I guess it is a matter of preference but it did not work for my son at all.
2,not at all useful,I am looking to buy a potty DVD to get my daughter (27 months) motivated to use the potty (again). She knows what to do and she can do it and did it but she prefers diapers.My daughter actually liked the DVD but didn't want to use the potty which obviously is not the fault of the DVD. So for us it would serve the purpose but my expectations were completely different. I thought that the children would actually been shown what to do and how to use the potty. Instead everyone only talks about the potty. Elmo (as baby Elmo) sits on it once but that's about it. What we see in detail is how to wash hands after having gone to the potty which is just mentioned and not shown.If I had bought this DVD to accompany actual potty training I would have been very disappointed. Luckily I only rented it and I haven't decided if I am going to buy it (only because my daughter likes it).
2,Potty Time,Eli (my 2 year old son) likes to watch this right at the beginning then he loses interest quickly. It doesn't really teach about actually going to the toilet so he is still afraid of the toilet! I am thinking I may have to purchase a different potty video!
2,Boring.,"My son didn't really like this video at all. It didn't hold his attention. If your child really really LOVES Elmo, this might work. My son apparently just isn't that interested in Elmo."
4,Great motivator,"This little dvd is a great motivator to get your child excited about going potty. Other reviewers are right when the toilet is seldom shown but since I'm teaching her about the actual potty and how to use it, I figure this dvd is just something she can dance along with and listen to them talk about how it's okay not to potty train right away and that everyone is different."
5,Great video,This helped us tremendously with potty training. The songs are very catchy too! I like how it covers a wide range of potty issues/concerns.
5,Big help in getting my Toddler interested in the whole process!,"My 2 +yr old toddler did not want to potty train but after watching this he became willing and able to potty train. He now frequently asks to watch this video and it helps to reinforce the potty training process--for him and me! I did NOT have issue with some of the ""words"" used as commented on in other customers reviews. Definitely worth the buy at such a low price--especially if you are looking for some potty training back-up!"
3,"Goid, but long for little ones","A little long wunded for 2-3 year olds but gets the point across nicely. My sone began tuning out after the "" you gotta go"" song other friends have said the same about their kids as well."
2,good for 3 years old,This is a cute video and my daughter loves it. The issue I have is that is totally glosses over the actual process of going lofty on the toilet so it is not really instructional. My daughter is 21 months so she enjoys the show but doest really understand the lesson. A three year old probably would though.
1,Very disappointing!,"I expected a much better quality of video from the folks at CTW; Elmo's Potty Time is a disappointing mess from start to finish.Not only does this video not hold the attention of my 25-month-old Elmo fan- it scares the bejeepers out of her! For some inexplicable reason there is an animated King Kong sequence in the middle of this video that is unecessary and makes my daughter run screaming from the room. The content of this video contains too much filler, bad music, and the use of the word ""dookie"" (!)- and this from the team that brings us Sesame Street!I would not recommend this for anyone of any age. Shame on Children's Television Network!"
1,Dont buy from this person!,This product came with the wrong DVD in the right case! I called the customer service the lady told me it was out of stock. so the put something closed to what i wanted. wtf! no i order potty time elmo for a reason. buyer beware
2,A little bit scary (for parents),"We got this for our two-year-old Elmo fan thinking that it couldn't hurt. After all, her Elmo toothbrush got her to brush her teeth, maybe Elmo could work some magic here too?I guess it's ok. She likes it ok, but she has never asked to watch it or anything. However, I was really disturbed by it, mostly because Elmo's dad sounds exactly like ""Chef"" from South Park (Isaac Hayes). It is uncanny, so much so that I had to check the credits to see who did the voice. As a result (and especially because of the subject matter), I spent the entire time watching it expecting Elmo's dad to say something really inappropriate.Of course, I know this is my problem and not my kid's. But, I know other parents that had the same reaction and were similarly disturbed. And there are probably better potty training DVD's out there anyway."
1,This Movie Smells Like Going to the Potty,This film is horrible. Just a bunch of song and dance. My 3 y/o watches it because she thinks it's a musical. There isn't even actual scenes of Elmo taking a dump.
3,Potty humour,I could not believe my eyes when I saw this one. My daughter loves Elmo and is not yet potty trained so I thought this might be something. Indeed it is! This one somehow verges on the bizarre with its potty fixation....I am not sure I approve of this for kids but it sure is funny for an adult.
4,My kid loves this DVD but it hasn't served its purpose yet!,"This DVD in my opinion is not a very effective tool for potty training younger kids who still cannot communicate effectively but may work well for older kids who are more fluent in speech. It is however very entertaining to my 20 month-old toddler with all the characteristic singing in Sesame Street DVDs. He loves it and wants to watch it over and over. He has shown a lot of interest in toilet paper and washing his hands since watching the DVD but still has absolutely no interest in the potty despite having watched the DVD countless times. It's probably just not the right time for him maybe later it will bear fruit. I personally think there should have been more to show kids using their potties, there is a lot of beating about the bush so am not sure the subject is very clear for younger kids who need more visual and less talk to understand things."
4,no more diapers!,"I bought this DVD for my two year daughter. She had already loved Elmo, so I thought that this would be a great help in potty training. I think that is entertaining more than teaching. So, overall I didn't find it really helpful."
1,"not helpful, my kid wasn't interested in watching more than 20 seconds","This video doesn't seem like normal Sesame Street quality entertainment, and that's what it needs to be in order for kids to watch. Entertaining and informing. Sadly, this video falls short of both. I've tried 2x to get my kid to watch this video and it doesn't last beyond 20 seconds and he gets up and does something else. I can see why: there's probably about 10-15% of the video actually showing potty time, and the remainder of the video is not evening interesting. I was hoping for a fun video that just shows Sesame Street characters doing ""stuff"" with or around the potty to help my child realize that the potty's not a bad thing. I wasn't looking for instructions. But people/puppets talking to each other without even a potty chair in the picture is meaningless. As is the kids or animals in a park. Very disappointing."
5,A great potty training tool,I am so happy with this video as is my 2 year year old. Its exactly the insperation my son needed. I had already been working on potty training with him but hearing Elmo sing and talk about it really got him excited about wanting to go. i have had this for a little over a month and he watches it every day and is excited to go potty. He even sings the song Elmo's dad sings to him while he is on the potty i am so glad i got this one.I will say if you are looking for a step by step instruction guide for potty training for your child then this is not the video for you. But if you are looking for a tape to inspire and mmake your child more comfortable with the concept and or if your child is a die hard Elmo fan like mine then he/she will love this DVD.
2,wrong age group,"I think this video is aimed more for 3 - 4 year olds. My youngest is a little over 2 1/2 and loves Elmo. He's showing signs for potty learning (and has used his little potty a few times) so I thought this video and a bright new RED potty would be fun this Christmas, but we didn't even get through this video. It *talks* about using the potty but doesn't really show anything... unless it's all near the end (don't know cuz we put on Curious George).I guess we'll try it again in a few days or weeks but it's pretty lame for Elmo. Nothing like how informative Elmo's World episodes are. Just a lot of talking and some silly songs. I recommend making this video like Elmo's World. It would be a lot more entertaining and helpful for younger ""potty-ing"" children. A lot more FUN."
3,Entertaining,I think my child found it more entertaining then actually learning something about how to use the 'potty'. You never see Elmo on the potty just singing and talking about it.
4,Great,"My son likes this video a lot. He's had it since he was about 18 months and he's 2 now. I'm not sure if is quite connecting the video with his own using the potty yet or not, but Elmo is as entertaining as always. I'm sure seeing and hearing about the potty on Sesame Street is helping him with the process. He is doing surprisingly well so far with his potty training. Maybe this helped? Either way, it's a lot of fun!"
4,Informative video that captures toddler's attention,We have started our 16 month toddler watching this video a few times a week. Hoping to kick start the potty training.
2,"Great content, cheap material","I bought it for my little boy. It had a defect that I could only play on my computer a few times and after that it does not work any more. However the content is great, my son enjoyed it. I did not return it as the shipping cost more than half of it and I am so busy that is why I bought stuff online."
1,Totally worthless,"As another reviewer mentioned, this DVD is absolutely worthless: out of the 45 minutes of singing and talking, less than 10 sec of potty footage is being shown (which, for a toddler, is what is needed to encourage potty training). My daughter got bored after 5 minutes of watching this DVD. Why are they so shy of showing Elmo sitting on the toilet?"
2,Not a lot of potty training content.,"This is a cute Elmo video w/ lots of singing and dancing about the potty, but there is no real instruction on how to use the potty, so it's not very instructional. My daughter likes the video, but it did not help us to potty train at all.One part of the video that really bothers me is during the segment where Elmo and his friends discuss all the different words for pee and poop. They use a word for poop (dookie) that really bothers me personally, and after my daughter said it a few times, I decided to get rid of the video."
2,Not focused and not aimed at right age level,"We bought several different potty training videos and this was, unexpectedly, the worst. The reason: It lacks focus. It comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids, or at least don't remember what potty training is all about.It goes back and forth between Elmo and short film and animated clips that focus on independence and doing things for yourself. But it doesn't really hold a 2 year old's interest and the song lyrics and such are overly complicated for a child of that age. My older daughter, who's potty trained for years now, watched it more than my son who grew bored really fast.If you are going for entertainment, get this DVD, but if you want your little one to start giving up diapers, go with Potty Power."
5,Good,"I didnt use it too much yet, but it has a good quality, came before than I expected. I recommend the item."
5,Elmo rules,"Not an aspect of potty training goes undiscussed in this very thorough hand-holding helper for both children and parents. Plus the songs are pretty funny. Thank you, Elmo, for help with this major milestone."
2,Not worth the money,"This dvd did not interest our 2 1/2 year old. she wouldn't even sit and watch it. She thought it was ""dumb."" She did just fine learing to go potty with help from grandma. I would not recommend it."
1,i dont know how can a child get intersted in going to potty with all the crazyness in this video,"is a waste of money buy potty power is better , in this video of elmo basically all the time is talking about going to the potty and you know all the steps which is fine, but for kid is better to watch other kids going and in this video only 1 kid goes i dont know i prefer potty power is so much better"
2,Dances around the issue,"I think there's 10 seconds of someone actually on the potty. My kid asks to watch her ""Elmo potty movie,"" so I can't give this one star, but it's so saccharine and doesn't really delve into the issues. Rather it talks about hand washing and two Muppets have an argument about whether wiping, flushing the toilet and washing/drying hand is three things or four."
2,Incomprehensible singing spoils good idea.,"Our daughter loves Elmo and we have a number of his DVDs. Regrettably this particular episode is let down by poorly pronounced English; making it good for entertainment but poor as a potty training tool. The word pronunciation is reminiscent of the 1980s Fat Albert cartoons.The possible fault is that the makers already knew the song lyrics before the lyrics were recorded in song. For we adults who do not already know the lyrics, they are almost incomprehensible - making it fully incomprehensible to a toddler.The most effective potty training video we have seen is ""Potty Power"" also available on Amazon."
5,Love it!!!,"My little boy loves Elmo. We started potty training and my little boy got the concept almost right away. We watched our god son one night and because he is 6 months younger than my son I think that it hurt the process a little bit, so I bought this movie as an extra motivator for him. He loves it. It was that extra push to get him into telling me when he had to go instead of me asking. All I had to say was ""see Elmo uses to potty"" and he was fully on board. I would not recommend it for anyone who have very little tolerance for Elmo. But if you will walk through fire for your child then a little help from Elmo, and maybe some headache medicine for you, potty training is a little easier."
2,SESAME STREET-ELMOS POTTY TIME,"TOO MUCH TALKING AND NOT ENOUGH ""DOING""....IN FACT, NO SHOWING ANYONE ON THE POTTY...HARD TO GET THE CONCEPT W/O BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR A 2 YEAR OLD!"
3,A miracle did not occur...,"I read the reviews before I purchased this dvd and although I do not enjoy potty humor I went with it anyway. I read that children watched this movie and were inspired...I'm still waiting for my 3 yr. old son to feel the need to use the potty and get rid of the diapers or ""listen to his body"" like Baby Bear and Grover do. We enjoy the movie, Sesame Street always comes through in entertaining the audience. However, I do not recommend this dvd if you think your child will watch it and be potty trained as a result. We love Elmo in our house (the adults, the 6 yr old., and 11 yr. old have been caught watching when it was thought no one was looking) and will continue to watch Elmo's Potty Time but I am no longer waiting for the miracle to happen. I guess he won't go to school in diapers and I should just be patient."
5,Elmo Potty Time,"My 3 1/2 year old has gone through a few regressions where he was going really well and then stopped.I recently purchased Bear in the Big House potty training and Once upon a potty both of which my son showed no interest in. He is a big Sesame Street watcher. This is the first potty training dvd that he will watch from beginning to end. He requests to watch it...I don't even have to encourage him..he just comes up to me and says ""watch Elmo potty training dvd"". He loves it.Sure there is content that isn't quite related to potty training on it but for a kid who knows what to do but just needs an extra encouraging push from characters he knows, this is a great dvd. He's not trained yet, but he is interested in it again thanks to this dvd."
3,Elmo Potty DVD was OKAY,My little gitl only watched the video twice. Although she was just about potty trained so I believe she was bored with it. Maybe she would have liked it better if I would have introduced the DVD the same time I did the potty.
4,Very cute video,"My 20 mo old loves everything Elmo and this is no exception! We are getting ready to start potty training. Initially she had no interest in her potty chair but since watching Elmo use the potty she has started sitting on it when she walks by it. It is a really cute video but not entirely devoted to potty training. If your child loves Elmo, this is a nice addition to the Elmo library and introduces them to the concept of using the potty."
2,Not what I had hoped.,"This started out well but quickly went downhill. Frankly, about 10 minutes into it, the kids were really bored. I would save my money and buy a book."
3,What was I thinking?,"For some reason, I thought my daughter would want to watch a video on people going to the potty. what was i thinking? Even Elmo couldn't keep her attention when talking about the potty. They didn't even show Elmo sitting on the potty. I guess if you want to watch a video about kids talking about peepee and poopoo, then this is the one for you."
2,Only Entertaining,"If your kids like Sesame Street, this DVD is ok. As for potty training...don't count on it! Elmo does a lot of singing. Going #1 or #2 isn't emphasized much."
4,Pottie anyone?,"This was cute, not that it helped much with toilet training. But it was cute to have."
2,not worth it,It not helpful at all. all it does is just show elmo. not the important steps of toileting. find something else.
5,Potty Time!,"This video helped a lot. My son was 2 years 11 months and he was going potty randomly when others would use the bathroom. After watching the video he started telling me when he needed to go on his own, then within two weeks he started going poo in the toliet on his own. Now two months later and hes wearing big boy pants all the time.I believe it was a combination of him being ready and knowing that its something elmo does too. He loves the video and kept asking to watch it again."
2,Maybe for older kids,"I bet this would be great for older kids that idolize Elmo, but didn't work for my 22 month old. There really isn't any visual of using the potty - more talking and singing about it. I was hoping for simple language and visuals instead."
4,Pretty Good,Purchased this for my almost three year old. She loved Elmo at the time and we struggled with her going to the potty. Needless to say she went a little but really liked watching the DVD and singing along with the songs.
3,BORING,I'm a bit disappointed by this DVD. My boys LOVE Elmo but it's not enough to keep them interested in this potty training DVD. I think it's geared toward an 'older' audience not my 27mth olds.
2,"No, please, just get another dvd.","Real let down by Elmo. The pace is slow and preachy. Forget a toddler 'I' did not have the patience to sit through this. Felt really let down by Elmo. They have such fun videos, wonder what happened this time ! I give it 2 points because we are still fans of elmo."
3,not for mine..maybe for older kids,"So My 2 1/2 yr old son absolutely loves elmo. so I got him this dvd to help him get fully potty trained. I put it on for him, and would not even watch it at all. i tried four different days... and nothing. it is more for older children who can comprehend more. maybe pre-k or older. I will be trying another dvd. if you can, rent or borrow this one before you buy."
2,Not worth it!,"So we like Sesame Street and all, but Elmo is so hard to understand and the content is ridiculous. I honestly tried to get enthused but my 2.5 year old wasn't having it! We watched it maybe 10 times and not once did we get more than 5 minutes into it."
5,Potty Time,"Very cute! Has several ""catchy"" songs that has helped my 2yr. old learn about all the aspects of potty training. Good buy!"
2,May have Elmo but... it's for older kids,"my daugher is adhd and is a visual learner and this put her to sleep. Yes it shows elmo on the potty in the beginning of the movie but then talks about using the potty for the rest of the movie. My daughter really enjoyed ""go potty go"" and "" once upon a potty"" with those two movies and one afternoon she's finally using the potty all by herself! word to the wise.. rent this from your local library and make sure it's right for your child... if it is then buy it."
4,Elmo's potty time is ok,"My 28 month old likes this dvd and watches it often. However, she has yet to use the potty!!! She loves elmo and i thought this would encourage her to go but no luck yet. Maybe it's working slowly....but she loves the video so that's good. It does a lot of talking about poo poo and peepee and dirty diapers, but i would like a different focus of pottying."
2,Waste of money,This DVD is a waste of time and money. Your kid will get the hang of it without watching this. I bought it and my boy may have watched it once.We all became potty-trained without videos telling us how to do it!
5,Educational DVD,"It is a Great help ,for little ones .My 3 year old little girl loves it and it help her alot ,after seeing it ,went directly to the potty .Worked out the first time !!!"
3,Watching Elmo' Potty Time Over and Over and Over and.....,"My two-year old loves to watch this over and over again even though we have other Elmo videos. We are in the process of potty training and the video does seem to have sparked an interest in the potty. We now have success every morning and after nap time. However, as a parent, the video itself was not as great as I had hoped. I want my child to use terms we have implemented for ""number one and number two,"" and the song where kids express what they call it has confused my child. I dislike the term ""urinate and pee"" and also ""dooky and doody."" Hopefully our child won't repeat these. I also don't care for the accent Elmo's father has. It is hard to understand him. The video does not really show anyone (with the excpetion of Elmo in the beginning) sitting on the potty."
1,Waste of Money,My daughter loves Elmo and I am very pro-Sesame Street so I thought this would be great. Not so! There is no instruction whatsoever about actual potty training except for a bit on washing hands at the end. They just dance around and talk about how great using the potty is (and that it's ok to have accidents) for 45 minutes! They also use many different words for pee and poo when what a kid needs is consistency. I think even my daughter could tell there was no content because normally she is mesmerized by Sesame Street and she really didn't care about this. Major disappointment.
5,Great DVD!!,My son is 22 months old and loves this movie. Within two days of watching Elmo he began telling me when he had to use the potty. I would recommend this to anyone who was beginning potty training.
4,Elmo's Potty Time,"I bought this DVD for my son for his 2nd birthday, and he loves Elmo and wants to watch it all the time!"
4,Elmo at age 3 would have made more sense...,"I have two girls, 3 and almost 2, and they are both using the potty. They request this dvd occasionally when given a choice between all their Sesame Street and Elmo videos. I read some of the reviews and although after watching this many times I still have yet to see the scene with Elmo's Daddy without pants! For one reviewer this was a concern. But most of the time ""monsters"" do not wear any clothes so I am a bit confused on that one.I gave this four stars because since I missed the whole Muppet babies era it would have made more sense to me to have Elmo using the potty at his current age, which I believe is roughly 3 or 3 1/2, rather than a ""baby"" Elmo. Also, I think Elmo should have been seen on the potty more often as I think that would have been a big motivator. For them to see their beloved Elmo using the potty too!Overall the point is good and it is fun to watch. Having grown up with Sesame Street myself I have a renewed appreciation for the show."
3,Maybe better for older toddlers,This is a cute video for older children who understand words. There is a lot of explanation and talking about potty time. It's just not that great for younger children who don't follow the dialog. Not that helpful if you're starting your toddler off early.
4,"Worked for us! The ""push"" we needed.","I bought this for my very stubborn toddler for her third birthday. She watched it several times over the weekend. Monday I began potty-training again, she had a couple of accidents. After that day she was potty-trained. I think it was a combination of several things and not just this video. I have another toddler that will turn 2 in a couple of months and she watches the video and has gained interest in the potty as well. Again I think it's a combination of other things as well.My kids seem to really like the video. They are watching it now. This is NOT the best for potty-training fundamentals, but will spark their curiosity.I agree with the other parent with the word ""dookie"", TOTALLY inappropiate!!!"
5,Fantastic Video! Best Money I Have Ever Spent!,"This was probably the best purchase I have ever made, as it helped my amazingly strong willed 3 1/2 year old become completely potty trained in a week. I thought the video was fantastic! It finally made everything click with my daughter and she understood she wanted to wear underpants. After watching this for a week, she declared no more Dora diapers! And that was it. We never went back and only have had a couple of accidents since. I do agree that this video may be most useful with a little bit older toddlers who are finishing up potty training. And they need to love Elmo as well. But the music was very cute and I got my daughter to keep coming over to the potty with me by singing ""It's potty time!"" in the same voice as Elmo's father which she cracks up over. Thank God for Elmo's Potty Time! No more diapers in this house!"
2,Not for young potty trainers,"At first this video caught my daughter attention since it features Elmo. But there's very little action, so she bored of it quickly. It's more of an interview movie, where he talks to other puppets about the potty. Not very engaging for the potty training age range. This would have been more effective if you actually saw any potty training happening. She may find it more interesting, AFTER she is finished potty training, since perhaps she'll be old enough to have the patience to sit and watch a bunch of other people and puppets sit around talking for an hour."
3,Potty Propaganda works wonders,"Despite my objections to Elmo in general, this video is pretty good. My 2-year old daughter enjoyed it from the beginning and is very interested in what Curly Bear did in her potty. I only wish we saw more puppets/people/animals/monsters actually going potty. There is quite a bit of talk of pottying but not much actual pottying going on.I do think, though, that the emphasis on trying to go, not wearing diapers, and listening to your body work well. My kid loves Elmo but this is the only Elmo concession I have been willing to make. It does have catchy songs and she enjoys dancing to the 'factory' part. The ""Stomp"" inspired section is her other favorite."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I agree with the other reviewers. THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY POTTY TRAINING CONTENT. Elmo and friends just chants ""potty is good"", ""potty is cool"", etc. throughout the overly long video. Can you really convince a toddler who has always been in diapers that just because ""potty is cool"" to go pee/poop in the toilet? I think not.The video is also overly long, close to an hour. My son who LOVES Elmo got bored after about 20 minutes. I am glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste any money buying this video."
1,Nope,Daughter was completely bored and was doing everything else besides watching this DVD. So we were annoyed. Totally waste of money
3,cute,"The DVD is cute, I think it's pretty helpful for potty training with a lot of information for kids, such as; accidents are OK, that you have to wipe, flush, and wash your hands, that everyone goes through potty training, once trained you get to wear underwear, and other fun information. My son loves Elmo and will sit through the video, but doesn't seem that interested in it and it didn't change his desire to go to the bathroom what-so-ever. So it is a cute and helpful DVD, just not so much for my son."
3,Okay,"This movie is okay. My son is 2.5 and has never even gone once in the potty, although he does sit on it. He did not care about this movie really. He got the idea but still has no interest. He does love Elmo's world but does not seem as enthralled with this. I will give it another try and see if it peaks his interest in a couple months."
2,Potty Training DVD,"DVD was in excellent condition, but the video is a little strange. I really do not feel that this video helped to potty train my child at all. He just liked to watch it so he could laugh when they said wee wee or woo woo. I believe that all children are different and and learn when they are ready. Having said that, this video may work for some kids, but did not work for mine."
5,Avery Loves Elmo,My granddaughter is in love with Elmo so this certaintly was a good choice for her. What a fun companion to potty train with.
2,Not really helpful for the potty training process,"Don't get me wrong, if your kids love Elmo, this is an entertaining show. But unfortunately, if you're using it to help and instruct your little ones on actually HOW to do it, and the PROCESS itself...this is NOT the show for them. I was most disappointed with the abstract song sequences. The point that these sequences are often trying to get across were totally lost on both my kids. I wish more direct methods were used to talk about hand washing, accidents, stopping to try to go potty, etc. Disappointed."
3,Boring,I bought this DVD for my daughter since she loves elmo and I had wanted her to get an idea of pottying not so much as for training. Was hoping to have a elmo dvd for her even if pottying didn't work out. This DVD was quite boring and had a bunch of songs and clips of nothing to do with pottying. The songs might have conveyed encouraging messages about pottying but loosely related. She lost interest and I actually lost interest as well as it seemed to drag on forever. The upside is that the DVD does include this interactive book ernie potty book if one was looking to purchase that book. Overall the pottying content seemed to be a fail for me as well as the interest factor.
4,Catchy songs for beginning potty trainer,"This is a cute little bit of entertainment to start off your toddler potty training efforts. The songs are catchy. The TP rap is really good with some funny lines about the ""Master roll"" being too big to bring home. But ""Accidents Happen"" with Grover is the real gem here. We sing it all the time when we want to take the edge off of some whoopsie that may or may not be potty related.The physical DVD got scratched so we bought it from the Instant Video Store and watch it on our Roku now."
1,Just talk and talk,"The video is nice but not very useful the characters just try to talk the kid into using the potty, not clear instructions or examples. My baby loved it but no signals what so ever to try to use the potty, if you want cute songs and a lot of talk it's ok other than that don't even bother"
4,Good stuff!,"Wish Revlon hadn't discontinued this product. I use it under makeup to refract light and minimize lines around my mouth and circles under my eyes. As a last touch, after makeup application, I use a little to highlight cheek ""apples."" It brightens my face and gives me a more luminous and ""perked-up"" look.Wonder what I'll do when it's no longer available on Amazon? An excellent buy compared to other ""Luminizer"" products I've seen."
5,Excellent recording,"I bought this recording directly from Jason Hardy. He is a most talented singer. More recently, I heard him perform Handel's Messiah with the Kansas City Symphony. Besides being an excellent singer, he is a fine young man. His former wife, who unfortunately passed away in 2007, was my niece."
5,a wonderful spiritual awakening,a fresh look at the bible accompanied by inspiring profiles of saints and virtues. wonderfully organized and simple to use.
4,My New Bible,The Faith Filled Catholic Women's Bible has given me many hours of pleasant reading. The Spiritual Awakenings between sections are especially helpful. My only complaint is the small size of the print. I must wear my glasses to read it.
4,"Of course a great Bible, lacking in study the ""study"" part","This Catholic Bible has a great ""feel"" to it. While the study sections are great, I'd like to get see something a little different."
3,Strange Visitors,"After enjoying the tv show I thought I would begin reading the series of books to tide me over until the next season began. Strange Visitors was a good book to start off the series of books and if you enjoy Smallville you will definitely enjoy the book.Highs:Lex Luthor- I thought the author did a fantastic job with his dialogue and character.Stuck to the story and created another Smallville experienceLows:Clark Kent- He seems to be too innocent and childish. I wanted a hero.Story- It covers a lot of territory and does not pick up until the very end.Overall this was a good start to the series. If you are a fan of the show it should be entertaining, while if you want fast paced action I would jumpt to the next book ""Dragon."""
4,a decent start,"I found the supplemental books to the show somewhat less involved than I wanted it to be. The problem with the series in general is the constant need to explain Clark's origins unnecessarily. People who read the books probably watch the show...even if they don't watch regularly, the origin of Superman/Clark Kent is fairly common knowledge and doesn't need to be explained in great detail in every supplemental book.There wasn't much substance, but I did enjoy the book. It's probably not so much for adults as it is for teens, and it's obvious from the writing."
3,an ok book,"i totally love the smallville series on television but this book is nothing like the show. i won't go into plot details like other reveiwers have because they explained what the book is about. all in all the smallville books so far are not up to par, they really do not reflect the show."
1,misrepresented product,"Editorial Reviews are totally wrong. There are NO Afro-Cuban rhythms, coordination, and improvisation. There are NO live band performance, Mambo, Nanigo, Songo, and Mozambique styles, and more.This is a bare-bones beginners book, and not a good one at that. Advise you look at Peter Gelling & Charlie McCoy basic harmonica books."
2,Big Disappointment,"This disc does not contain songs by the (original) ""Various Artists,"" but remakes by Tony Paglia. Definately more 1990's cheesy 'lounge' than 1960's cool."
4,Donna Richardson's Sweating In the Spirit 2,"This is a great exercise routine. I've worked out to Donna's programs in the past and as always she gives great instruction. What I love about the program is that it is easy to follow and I really feel like I worked out when I'm done. I feel like I've worked muscles that haven't been worked out in a while. The 20 minute and 30 minute work outs are great. I didn't care for 10 minute line dance program, but I think that if you enjoy line dancing you won't have a problem with it. It's worth buying and it's really different as it has you working out to glorify God and working out to Christian music is a nice change too. Go for it you wont be dissappointed."
2,A lot of yelling,"Denise, why don't you turn up your mike instead. She is very energetic and upbeat but yells the cues the whole time. It was really irritating.I also didn't like the set too much - was really flashy, literally. Not recommended for anyone who has problems with flashing lights, etc. The walking segment wasn't really walking, it was just another lower impact routine, so that was a disappointment. In the same section there is one song with hardly any beat to move to so it is very awkward. I didn't care for the resistance band section because each segment was too short and didn't really jive well with the lower impact it was combined with. At $17.99 I really didn't feel it was worth the money at all."
3,Enjoy the DVD,This product came very quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. It is a great addition to my video workouts.
5,FABULOUS !!,I LIKE THE MUSIC AND THE FACT SHE USES SPIRITUAL THEMES THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO. SHE MAKES SURE YOU HAVE A BALANCE OF THE SPIRIT AND EXERCISE FOR THE BODY. THE ROUTINES ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND SHE HAS SEGMENTS FOR EVERY LEVEL OF FITNESS. I THINK THE SETUP LOOKS GOOD TOO.
