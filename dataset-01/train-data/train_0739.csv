5,Splendid Story of our Precious Babies,"A friend of mine recommended this book that she had just shared with her fifth grade son. I bought it, I read it, I cried, I loved it. When my step-daughter became an RN in a pediatric ward I reluctantly passed it on to her, but thought I really should. Now I have a friend in Germany who has a new grandbaby(here in the states) born four months early. The baby is now a little over two months old. She has started to gain weight, but still has a long way to go. I thought my friend and her husband as well as the baby's parents SHOULD HAVE a copy of this book."
2,"Oh, sweet pap and goo","A small dessert serving of metaphysics. I liked the ideas presented, but they came with a double dollop of cream. If Mr. Rodgers had a metaphysical neighborhood, this is the book he'd read to the kiddies. Yogananda's ""Autobiography of a Yogi,"" and books about Edgar Cayce cover the same material while providing a balanced metaphysical diet not so rich in cream."
3,"the book is ok, the author's writing is difficult to follow","Big George is a good book and has a good storyline, but the author's writing style is difficult to follow. It was highly recommended and a suggested purchase for the church media libaray. I think I will place it in the library, but will give a warning about how it is written...."
3,Neonatal nurse nit-picking,"In the book they say the baby is ""Forty-four grams, pound and a half"". Well, just so you all know, 44 grams is not even 2 ounces! Approximately 595 grams equal a pound and a half. What a silly mistake..."
2,Sweet but unimpressive,"This small book tells a sweet, sad tale, but that is it. The length leaves little room for indepth character development or story line. If you are looking for a quick read, without much depth, this may be OK. The book was highly recommended to me by a friend, but I was disappointed."
1,"Pro-WinNT, glosses over Linux/Apache, no real hardware info","The author must be a Microsoft salesperson. The entire work is based on a WinNT server. Linux and the Apache server software are glossed over. The Microsoft NT package to only *try* to rival Linux/Apache will only set you back $4,000+ from the great god @Redmond. My copy of this title will be shelved... I am sorry I read the reviews and purchased this title. I wanted information, not a sales job."
5,Perfect,This stopper keeps the bubbles in bubbly for a looooong time. Great for a mid-week glass of champagne...never waste again cause it'll be fresh the next time you want it! Super easy to use.
5,The best stopper,The length of this champagne stopper gets down around the bottom of the lip of the bottle and clamps. Keeps champagne bubbly for at least a day...if it lasts that long. I use it to stop up the bubbles and stick it back in the fridge even though it will be used instantly.
5,A champagne must-have,"I love champagne, but rarely drink it because I am the only one that enjoys it in my house. However, this has allowed me to have a glass and save the bottle for days. I have had a bottle still bubbly after a week. It's easy to use and wash, I highly recommend."
3,Still haven't seen it yet,"Can't really rate this product yet, as it never showed up. I'll update with a new rating if it ever gets to me,"
1,doesn't work on a wine bottle.... :(,Tested it on a wine bottle and it doesn't work.....Tried a lot of different positions and it simply doesn't work.Don't recommend it.
2,Was not in good condition,"I had higher expectations. The book I got was marked up and highlighted a lot, and I hate that. So this was not a good purchase for me. I'm not going to buy from this seller again."
3,not my kinda thing,"this book is highly touted as a great example of mao dun's socialist realism. well even if it is, i didn't much care for it. i found the heroine to be really irritating, and just her whole experience wasn't something i found myself very interested in. if it weren't for the fact that i had to read this book for class, than i highly doubt i would have finished it. even so, it's not altogether bad or anything, it's just not my thing. hence the review of 3 stars. also, just to note, i don't really like modern Chinese literature as a whole. that may have something to do with why i didn't like this work very much."
2,Bird feeder just OK,I received this bird feeder today and it arrived with wood that had cracked. I agree with others that the way this was packed was very poor and surprised that it wasn't in many more pieces. The cedar is quite poor quality and I don't think it will last all that long. But because the price of shipping is so expensive I will keep it and use it as much as possible.
4,Great birdfeeder,"This is a large bird feeder. Bigger than I expected which was an added delight. This is Very well built, and has stood up to a hard month of New England winter so far. It has also taken all the pesky squirrels have given it. So far it has been great."
3,Looks Great,"It looks great in my backyard. The birds like it, also. I like the feeder because it holds a good amount of seed. One of the feeders has a deep split in the wood on the corner already. It would be really helpful to have a slight raise in the middle of the floor of the feeder. The seed seems to stay in the middle and the birds can't reach it when it gets low. There is still a good amount of seed in the feeder at that time."
3,One flaw otherwise good value,"Simple design but has a flaw that you may not notice unless pointed out. If you don't mind excessive amounts of uneaten seed all around your feeder this isn't even a flaw. If you look at the picture where the chickadee's are you may notice that where the seed falls out is a trough of sorts. The trough is basically the outer edge of the bottom board of the feeder. The board has ""trim"" that makes a lip so the seed doesn't spill out immediately. What they forgot was a lip on either end by the suet feeder. I simply cut a 2""x2"" pressure treated board I had laying around and made two end pieces to finish the lip all the way around the feeder. Just that 1/2 lip on each end keep 80% off the feed in the feeder which is where I prefer to view my birds.Otherwise good product and great shipping."
1,Poor Assembly,"I was extremely disappointed with this feeder. When I took the feeder out of the box, one end of the feeder was completely detached from the base. The person who assembled the feeder apparently did not notice that the staples were not placed in the proper position to line up with the end pieces and consequently did not attach the end piece to the base. One of the suet holders had only one nail and probably should have had four nails, consequently, it fell off immediately. It's apparent the the company producing the feeders does not have a final inspection of the assembly operation. It will take about 45 minutes using clamps and elephant glue to make the feeder usable. Not a good buy!"
2,perky pet feeder,"Overall the main part of the feeder is holding up well. However, the wood brackets that holds the suet packetwere so thin the squirrels chewed through them in 3 days making that feature useless. A wire mesh would havebeen a much better idea. I would definately NOT buy this product again or recommend it to a friend."
2,birdfeeder,The top does not sit well on the feeder when trying to hang it at a higher level. It sits crooked. It should be affixed to the bottom with a swing door on top.
2,Just OK,"This bird feeder is OK, but not very heavy duty.The Cedar smell is nice, but the construction is not up to par."
3,Not a long term feeder,"This bird feeder worked great for about the first 2 years I owned it, however now, the roof leaks water through the holes that you can hang it with, and the wood on the side has cracked and that now allows rain/bugs to get inside the feeder and ruin the seed. Looking to replace this with a metal/plastic unit that won't split and that has better roof overhang."
2,arrived broken in two places,"the product itself seems ok however with the way amazon packed this product i received it broken in two places///first time ever had this problem with amazon.com, very upset!"
4,play your best pool review,"The book is very good and it is for any level of pool shooter. I felt that if I learned one thing from the book, I would be happy. I've learned many things so it's worth it. I'm still reading it but so far so good. I would say that this book if for the shooter that wants to improve their game - the less experienced you are, the more you are going to get out of this book."
5,wealth of resource,"Phil Chapelle's book ""Play Your Best Pool"" is a wealth of resources. It is quite thorough and would be good for someone seriously interested in pool. It's got a 60+ page section on 8-ball, an equally thorough section on 9 ball, and more on the fundamentals, shotmaking, position play,how to improve, practice techniques, and equipment. My games have significantly improved by reading and using Chapelle's book. Highly recommended. So much information that a novice might be overwhelmed, and it might not be so useful if you don't have a home table to go through it all (I wish I did)...but still, an indispensable book."
5,Must Read!,"Covenant Marriages has the potential to save marriages all over the world. The author has given real life, real talk biblical advise for keeping a marriage together for the long haul. I have used it in counseling with other married couples.Covenant Marriage"
3,Detailed but incomplete,"Deals only with planes made of wood. A detail hidden in the sub title. It does provide much history and detail, but does not include any information on Stanley or any other manufactureur on the eastern seaboard."
1,It sucks,"I had this player for 3-4 mos. when it just started acting funny. That is resetting, turning off and finally the fuse blew. I was going to bring it to a shop, but I just ending up throwing it in the trash. I think Pioneer should compensate anyone who bought this dvd player. Since it seems, I'm not the only one that had problems with this dvd player"
2,Same problem here...,"I have one too, with the same problem...It resets randomly, but not often. About 1 time in 3 DVDs played.If somebody can help, please do."
2,Would be a good player except...,"After about 1.5 hours of playback, the player will suddenly reset. It will then give you 30 minutes or so more, but will eventually reset again. We took it back and exchanged it for another unit (same model), and the new one has the same problem. We thought maybe it was heat related, but we've now got the player set up in a very open space so that heat really shouldn't be an issue, and the problem still occurs.I've looked around to see if anyone else has had this issue, but there are very few reviews out there for this model. Has anyone else seen this problem? And if so, does anyone know if Pioneer has put out a fix for it?Other than the reset issue, this is a perfectly decent player. Picture and sound is good, the remote is easy to use, and the GUI is pretty good."
1,Historical fraud,"This book is an example of the worst kind of historical fraud. The ""theories"" presented are not just speculative, but plain ridiculous. Anyone interested in Indian history should completely ignore it."
1,AMAZON DELETED MY OTHER ONE STAR REVIEW,Amazon allows the authors friends and publisher's shills to write positive interviews for books and then deletes any one star reviews when the publisher complains. So I thought I'd write another.Basically - genetic research has proven that there was in influx of invaders (mostly male) into Northern India in the not too distant past. Their genes remain in the chromosones of the upper caste males of India. This research was done by both Indians and Americans jointly and is scientifically provable and published in peer reviewed journals.This book is simple speculation and earnest wishing. Don't take it for any truth.
1,"Poor installation, Pictbridge nonsense, rattly scanner","Installed exactly as instructioned. Drivers installed fine. Lexmark software would not install. After an hour of uninstalling, restarting and reinstalling, I found a way to manually install the software. (Lexmark's site was absolutely no help.) I was able to print and scan using Windows' utilities, but Lexmark's own sofware wouldn't detect the machine. When scanning, it made an unusual rattling noise and the scans came out with horizontal lines. When using Pictbridge to print photos directly from the camera, it doesn't automatically print at the highest quality setting. You have to go into the printer's default settings in Windows, set the quality to the highest setting first. After you're done, you have to go back into the settings and change it back to your preference. This sort of kills the whole purpose of Pictbridge if you're looking to quickly print a few photos directly from the camera."
1,Third Class Printer,I would not recommend to buy this product. 10 reason not to buy.1. Cheap stuff2. Delicate3. Shakes while printing4. Poor quality print.5. Fax dose not work all time6. Auto feeder sucks.7. Does not come with USB cord8. Expensive catridges.9. Poor quality color print
4,Works just fine.,"We have had no issues with it working. We had to reload software a couple of times, which was annoying. The worst thing is the lock up it causes when you print, mine always trys to get me to buy ink and connect to the internet. I use a laptop that is not connected all the time so maybe that causes the issue. We would buy it again even with these problems. It is just nice to have the scan/fax feature."
1,Don't plan to scan to pdf files,"This printer does not scan to PDF's acceptably under Windows Vista, so if you're planning on using it for that, buy a different brand. From what I've been able to determine, Lexmark says it's Vista and Microsoft says it's the Lexmark driver."
4,"Panasonic great, delivery time poor",This product was impossible to find in stores so I had to buy via online. It would have been nice if the vendor (Tong Store)had stated upfront that they use the US Postal Service for shipments. It took almost three weeks to get my package. But it was a very good price and product works just fine.
2,"OK fax copier, phone. acceptable for the SOHO","if you need to send faxes it is ok, the memory seems to get overloaded if you send more than 5-6 pages. the print quality on the recieve side i have found to be on the poor side and the auto fax answer switch mode does not work with my VOIP service. the copying is ok.the phone is good, but, again, does not interact well with VOIP service and cannot indicate when i have voicemail waiting due to the internal answering machine.it comes with a rather limited print ribbon/film, so i would suggest getting an extra one if you decide on buying one of these units, and use it to recieve faxes.just about acceptable for small home office use."
3,2-line Panasonic Fax,"This machine is a nice size and shape. I am fairly technically apt, but I found the manual to be extremely complex. Since I am mainly using this machine to send faxes, I have not even bothered to figure out all the complex phone features yet, but have confidence that I will be able to when I need them. The thing that surprises me is the fax capacity. I thought this machine would handle at least 3-4 clean, wrinkle-free pages at a time, but it does not. I have to sit and feed the pages in one at a time or it takes 2 or 3 together or jams. I honestly thought it would do a better job. I guess it just isn't your big business fax at the office. I am satisfied, but certainly not thrilled."
3,not for us,"Fax set up very difficult to figure out - finally gave up on it - 3 adults tried. Otherwise machine worked however, once learned radiation output from free-standing phones is as bad as with cell phones, went back to landline telephones and different type ans. machine."
2,Not fit for bedroom use,"Emits a steady, audible, electric current-type hum even when the CD player and radio are off, and so based on my experience, it seems to me that this unit is not suitable for use in bedrooms where people will be sleeping. This was fairly disappointing to me as it went well with the bedroom decor. I'd return it but it sounds ok and looks cool, so I'm moving it to my garage workshop, where I need a clock and music anyway. By the way, if you need advanced alarm clock technology, it seems to me that this unit isn't your baby, because as far as I can tell, it has only one alarm and was designed primarily for use as a CD and radio player."
2,Looks great and that's about it...,"Loved the look of this radio and it looks great in my art deco-inspired home office. However, the CD player almost IMMEDIATELY stopped working. The buttons are hard to push and sometimes have to be pushed a couple of times before they work. The printing on the buttons is small and hard to read. The volume button is awkward to use. All in all, I would never buy this radio again. It looks great, and that's about it."
4,"Great, but . . .","We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He loves it, is easy to operate, and seemingly durable. We'll be watching the top closing CD tray to see if it lasts.We set it up on the kitchen counter during the Christmas holiday festivities. Everyone (and I do mean everyone) commented on the great look, and all (yes, I do mean ""all"") were amazed at the surprisingly great sound from such a simple looking unit.Our only complaint is a low level hum from the speakers, even when all audio is off and only the clock function is operating. Strange. But so far, our son hasn't noticed."
5,great loop,"I use it for looking into screens for my screen printing business, and works fine when doing any touch ups."
4,GOOD STUFF,"A powerful and sometimes moving film, that links the infamous, well in the UK anyway, Range Rover murders with a bit of film exageration to produce a effective piece. Bean provides a stunning role, as does the actor who plays Billy Whizz, the driver. Quality of the picture is good as is the sound. A must see !"
1,"VERY, VERY, DISAPOINTING!!","I just dont know how they get away with making films so slow,and boring!This movie was suggested to me by a friend who shares the same taste as myself,however,i found it very hard to get into.It`s not often that i cant wait for a movie to end but,that is the only lasting thought i have of this film.My advice to anyone about to buy,RENT IT FIRST!"
4,Essex Boys,"More violence than I normally like to watch, got the video because it had Sean Bean and was quite surprised by it. It takes considerable acting skill to be as good-looking as he is and make you not notice it. If I'd never seen the Sharpe series or anything else except Essex Boys and someone asked me to describe Bean, I would have said ""tall, blond and ugly as homemade sin"" because somehow, all you see is the dark, misshapen soul of the sick character he plays.The acting and photography are all good, although the accents were too thick for my American ears, had to use sub-titles. The story was too sad and too violent for my taste, felt depressed as much as entertained. But if you like the genre, this is a well-made and engrossing film."
2,Much Better Brit Crime Movies Are Available,"I like Sean Bean, and Tom Wilkinson, but their presence did not help to elevate this empty, pointless, inartful movie. Character development? Not really. Clever dialogue? Virtually none. Great acting? Plenty of OVERacting, in my opinion. Credible story? ""Based on a true story"", they claim. But they botched it badly, by bringing in too many scenes of gratuitous and predictable violence, a sure sign of a lack of creativity. I knew a body would come flying out of that nightclub window! This movie brings to mind a posing imitation thug, full of insecurity and ineptitude, which he tries to hide by macho posturing, nasty language, bragging and violent gestures. All fake and phony, no substance there at all. And we're all supposed to take these idiots seriously? Please! I did not care a whit for any of the characters. At least Lock Stock and Snatch had some humor. Instead, see Caine's Get Carter, or....Long Good Friday,.....Footsoldier.....etc.."
4,"Good price,for what you get!",The cartridges are good even though HP is ripping you off. At least the price I paid here is a lot better than at most stores. Overall a good transaction!
5,inking,"Very positive purchase overall. Communication was great re order status,VERY quick receipt, and product exactly was expected."
5,Don't use refills or generics,"Let's face it, ink is expensive. After all, it's how the printer companies actually make money. BUT, don't be tempted by generics or worse, the mall kiosks who offer to refill your cartridges for pennies on the dollar.First, using anything other than the brand name originals will void your warranty, plain and simple. Second, generics often come with less ink and refills are often ""watered down"" so they don't last as long. Third, generics and refills have a higher chance of leaking and if they do you'll be buying a new printer thanks to your $10 savings- remember, you voided your warranty!HP makes some pretty good printers and if you stick to HP ink, you will likely have a much happier printing life."
1,As with all ink,"As with all ink, way too costly for way too little ink. If not for the space in landfills I would rather buy a new printer for less then the cost to buy new ink."
1,HP customer service?,"I bought a pack at another retailer, so my review is only of the product itself. Upon installing a brand new cartridge, my printer (HP 6310 all-in-one) insisted that the cartridge was empty. I found a page on HP's website that explained the debugging procedure that may possibly fix the problem. That didn't work. HP has a guarantee to replace any cartridge due to manufacturing defects, which this case obviously was because the other brand new cartridge in the pack worked perfectly. Upon calling HP customer support, they make you jump through any bell and whistle they feel like to make sure this process is as difficult and painful for you as possible. Bottom line: I abandoned the process (which I hoping would be a simple ""OK mail the defective unit here and if we confirm its defective, we'll mail you a new cartridge.""). Thus, I abandoned HP. Never buying a printer or cartridge from them again."
2,Poor quality,"I'd highly recommend anyone trying to 'low ball' these cartridges on price to watch out how old these cartridges are and when you're going to use them. I just tried both cartridges and 4 of each 5 lines of print is showing a faded print quality. I've run the clean cartridge numerous times and pulled them both out and re-aligned them 2-3 times. Since I purchased these cartridges earlier this year and on May 1st, the return policy expired, I have no recourse but to purchase a new cartridge from some other source. An expensive mistake which I will not repeat again with this supplier."
2,TOO MUCH FOR SHIPPING,I THOUGHT IT WAS SHIPPED WITH THE PRINTER AND NOT AN ADDITONALSEPERATE OUTRAGIOS CHARGE FOR SHIPPING THE CARTRIDGE. THANK YOU
5,HP 98 twin packs,Sorry for delay in reviewing--the two twin packs arrived very fast from the seller and in great condition. The expiration dates had not expired and I have been using them daily. I am very satisfied with the product and with the seller's cooperation-speediness in sending them to me
3,Not Retail Packaging,"We received the two cartridges. The price was reasonable, but the heading states ""Retail Packaging"" and it is not HP packaging. The cartridges are remanufactured. They are working fine so no complaints...but I would not have ordered remanufactured."
5,This product works great,This product works great. I would recommend this to anyone with a d4160 HP printer that would like to print things.
5,Great Deal,"Great price compared to every other store I've looked. Saved about $6-8 considering Amazon's price with free shipping is cheaper than buying them at the store. That's not even including sales tax so maybe $8-10. And buying two together is like buying bulk, its cheaper and you have another one ready to go when your ink cartridge decides to print half your page in grey."
5,Wow!,"The cartridges arrived promptly, worked flawlessly and saved me quite a bit of money!!! Thank you!"
3,HP Ink Cartridge,Although the ink cartridges perform as advertised I feel they don't last long enough for the high price.
5,This was the best shampoo that I've used ...,"This was the best shampoo that I've used yet. I have tried Paul Mitchell, Biolage, and numerous others in varying price ranges. Neutrogena has to be by far the best I've used. My hair was dull and damaged, and after one shampoo with Neutrogena, I looked in the mirror and it looked as if I had gotten professional highlights in my hair. It really was my natural highlights finally coming through! I would highly recommend this product to family, friends, and anyone who's willing to listen to me!"
1,Low Price Buys Low Quality,"Pro: Fairly inexpensive. Cons: Not packaged well for shipping. Even though the box was received intact, the rack was bent in two places, and had a broken weld as well. It was shipped in two halves loosely in the box, without so much as a sheet of paper between them. Due to movement inside the box during shipping, the pieces scraped the paint off each other in several places, which will quickly rust without touch-up. One nut was missing. Maybe it would be good to buy in a store without the rough handling inherent to shipping."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I've had this rack for over a year and I wouldn't go so far as to say this rack is a piece of crap but it does have some issues. First off, the brackets that come to fasten the basket to the rack mounts on the top of the car are absolutely the worse things ever designed. I have to strap my camping gear and luggage through the basket to the factory installed roof mounts so that it doesn't slide. I would suggest buying new brackets to attach it. Secondly, if you leave it on your vehicle, like I do, the color fades fast and rust starts to show up. I will be sandblasting mine and repainting it within the next few weeks. What I was disappointed by was its lack of aesthetics...it just doesn't look all that phenomenal on top of my Tahoe. It is fairly shallow and doesn't fill the roof like I had hoped for. I am planning on adding lights and possibly looking for an extension to change the looks. However, it does keep stuff from sliding and with the right brackets it is solid."
4,roof rack,"item was received quickly, was relatively easy to assemble, and to date has done it's job admirably."
2,A budget-price introduction with a few good tunes,"But uh, guys, aren't we missing a few key songs? Sunday Morning? Venus In Furs? Here She Comes Now? Candy Says? What Goes On? Some Kinda Love? After Hours? Studio versions of Sweet Jane and Rock and Roll? Who Loves the Sun? Oh Sweet Nuthin'?VU only put out four albums, and they're all good ones. Get them instead."
2,Please start elsewhere . . .,"Anyone interested in this band is substantially better off buying the first album - ""The Velvet Underground & Nico"" - or ""Loaded"" and moving on from there . This compilation is pointless; it misses a lot and would give the first-time listener a very skewed impression of the band. I suppose when a great band like the Velvet Underground have their material repackaged this pointlessly it's some sort of sign that they've been fully integrated into the mainstream of popular culture, but it sure does make for a poor listening experience. I can't fault any of the music here, but this is a perfect case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts."
2,"Great songs, but whats the point?","Like I stated in the title, the songs are all classics. But why have a greatest hits for the Velvets? Every album of theirs is essential, and every album was unique in its own way. Thats the main flaw of this compilation, because you can't get the feel for the band. If you are a fan of 60s rock, you really should own all the albums instead of a cheap sampler. And if you only want to buy one VU album, pick up ""Velvet Underground & Nico"". Its about the same price, and will immediatly have you addicted to the band. This is a well compiled sampler, but theres no need for a sample of the Velvets. If you buy it and decide you need to get everything this band has done, you will have no use for it. The Velvets are the ultimate cult and underground band, and the first real ""alternative"" to the mainstream. This is a poor representation of why they are possibly the greatest rock band ever."
5,A solid collection,"Well I can't agree with the rest of the reviews here. Every song on this compilation is great and in fine remastered sound (the live 1969 version of Sweet Jane sounds better here than on the never remastered Mercury cd). For me every Velvets' full length has some unlistenable moments (listen to European Son or Murder Mystery lately?). I would also rather listen to this cd than a cd of their tedious demos (see the Peel Slowly and See box set) or pay for two barely differing versions of the same album (the recent ""Banana"" album reissue with needless bonus tracks). Not every grunt and groan committed to tape by Lou and company between 1965 and 1970 needs to be heard or bought. If you are a rabid collector go buy everything. If you just enjoy certain songs (not a crime) buy this or some of the other Velvet Underground compilations on offer."
2,where to start? recording? song list?,HUGE Velvet fan. I won;t go into the whole music dynamic but man this CD sux camel b@lls. And the sister ray recording? THAT'S THE only reason I bought this. Ugh! better of starting with their The Velvet Underground as an intro- much better. If you want the venus in fur it's on the Nico album along with heroin which is included here. I thought they could have done a much better job. Get the import best of or the bootleg recordings. Warning- once u understand where Reed and the Velvet's coming from u WILL become addicted. 15 years later since I bought their album and I still play this in my car. And everyone around me was listening to pop and rap. For me rap as I grew up in the inner city but this opened up MY LIFE! as an individual. enjoy!
3,Heartache,"For true, die hard, Erykah Badu fans such as myself, this complilation is a must have. The tracks with Erykah Badu may not be anything like her current music, but they were ahead of there time. They have good beats and they show how much Erykah has grown up throughout the years. True, it's not her best recording, but I enjoy it and if you are a fan I would suggest you but this CD for your collection, it's a good investment."
1,Heartache is a real heartache.,"This album stinks, the only thing that kept me from throwing it out is that Erykah Badu's voice is on it. The album features an untalented man who couldn't sing if his life depended on it, boring remixes and an overall 1980's sound. I suggest, before buying this album that you invest your money into something more enjoyable like ten pounds of cotton candy."
4,Tribute to Grainger,"My star rating is in relation to the other Grainger Edition discs. This album has many tracks and all the most famous works of Grainger are on here, focusing mostly on his British work as opposed to Danish or his pieces that are totally original work. Thwaites really has a passion for Grainger as you can tell if you read some interviews with her. As Grainger pointed out it's hard to fit music which is so multifaceted into one instrument, even if there are 10 fingers working but Thwaites really takes advantage of the freedom of solo work and is wonderfully dynamic with volume and tempo and she adds so much character to these pieces, I especially love her Shepherd's Hey! On many pieces she uses some of Grainger's style: very powerful and almost frantic playing, but not too much. Listen to Grainger playing Molly on the Shore on piano and you'll know what I mean! This is one of the cornerstone discs of the Grainger Edition. To the Fore!"
4,Lots of hisorical facts and interesting poems.,This book gives much historical information in a short space. It also contains the 100 divination poems. The beginning is a bit dry but all in all a good book. The only thing I was hoping to find and did not was more stories about people who had had special or miraculous occurances that they attribute to her.
4,Kwan Yin Society Endorses this book.,The most unusual part of this book are the100 Kwan Yin Divinations that appear here for the first time ever in English. Anyone interested in Kwan Yin will enjoy this book.
2,Valid/Invalid,"I have a son that would play video games all day every day if I let him. After reading this I freaked out. I thought I was bad parrent with a son who had an out of control addiction to video games. NOT. Turns out you just have to have communication. When life gets hectic and teens life's get boring, video games. I played them a lot when I was younger. As long as you have a good relationship or just talk to tour kids and be there for them. They be ok.But really, this book put us through some hard times. Don't take it so literally. Talk to your kids. Trust in the Lord with all you heart and lean not on your own understanding."
5,"Low budget, High concept",Lexx is something either is understandable to you or is a b-grade sci-fi. Those looking for stoic and run of the mill sci-fi tend to vilify Lexx as badly written and directed. SciFi Channel's treatment of the series when it first aired alienated many people. Now is the time to see them in order and uncut! Those who appreciate something a little different and understand pacing outside the realm of standard American TV get the quirkiness and love the sexual overtones. Season 2 does suffer from a 'Movie of the Week' approach but those episodes seem more like homage&#65533;s than rip offs. Volume 1 introduces the grand freak Mantrid and sets the arc for the entire season. Watch and learn to Luv the Lexx.
5,Great DVD,"This Is A Great DVD When I first viewed this series os Showtime, I have to admit, I thought it (wasn't good). I would'nt watch it at all. It was'nt until friends convinced me to give it another try, that I found that I really did like the show. I'm a big SciFi fan and this really is a great series. Unfortunatly, it has now been canceled. I am in the process of buying all the episodes. This is one of the best."
1,bad,"This item must be for little kids. The seat is way too small. I am trying to figure out how to raise my regular toilt seat 4"" to use instead of the seat that come with commode. There is no way an average size person can use this and wipe himself. Not well designed."
2,Reincarnation .....doggy style?,"A trouble some pooch who has reaccuring dreams of being something else, something far greater.... A man. After a series of silly events he begins to take these dreams seriously and goes off on an adventure to find his family and his old life before..... HE DIED.While the story is very touching and has a very good moral too it it was far too too long for me and seemed kinda cheesy at some pionts they kept on reinfasizing reincarnation, reincarnation, reincarnation. It was interesting but at one piont it became very boring and I lost intrest. I have only been able to sit through it one time, because of this. It jusy seemed like the man was really in a coma and that at one piont that he was gonna wake up from this long boring nightmare but he never did.A great move to show small children at bed time so they fall asleep and perhaps people with a long patience or perhaps people with an intrest in animals and dogs would like to see it."
1,Basically a 90 minute PETA commerical.,"First off, I grew up with dogs, I have an affection for dogs. I even have respect for PETA and their effort to ethically treat animals. That's a good mission to have.But, that is a message that does not play well as this 90 minute movie. I mean with quotes like this ""Maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature."" just went too far for me.This movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay. The musical score was fine enough as was the melody.If you want a better dog movie, go get something like Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows. Both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion.This movie is literally for the dogs."
5,One of the most touching movies I've ever seen...,"I first saw this movie about 3 years ago when my older sister brought over the video to my house after she saw it and told me that I had to watch it because we were such dog lovers -- my family that is. All I have to say is that this movie just about made me bawl so hard that I needed tons of tissues. It is just such a touching story about family. Added to this is the cute factor of the animals that acted in there and the comic relief. The actors also did a great job as well. Even IF you don't believe in reincarnation, don't write it off and overlook the rest of the story because of that. While it may not be for some young children or some older children and even some adults as well for we all have our own tastes, it is indeed a treasure for me, now 28 years old, as a movie that is sincere and one of the best movies I've ever seen and would be proud to have in my dvd collection and show to my future children."
1,Such misinformation!,"I was given this book by a fundamentalist Christian relative (in hopes of saving me, I'm sure). Just incredible -- I found so many errors in the book, that alone was enough to make me wonder how it ever got published.Among the items listed that are considered satanic and on the path to hell:World peace, meditation, yoga, ecology, Tarot, Buddhism, breathing. Ok, I'm kidding about the last one, but it's about that ridiculous! How anyone could take this stuff seriously is way beyond me. Unfortunately, many do and that is getting us into a world of trouble. Literally.Read this book only if you want a peek into some truly scary ""thinking."""
1,Don't waste your time!,"Wanda Marrs is a very mind-wsahed women, I laughed when I read this, the evience is as fickle as her bra."
5,Great Buy,This watch was even better in person that it was in the picture. My fiance loves it and it is very sturdy and durable.
5,Very Nice Watch,This was bought as a gift for my other half. It was a bit large and we had to take it to the jeweler's to be re-sized. Other than that (it IS a watch after all) it is nice looking and stylish. He had admired a similiar one at the dealership.
4,An homage to male beauty,"Derek Jarman's first film (made in 1976) is a visually gorgeous film featuring an all male cast in various states of undress. Even if you are not interested in debating whether or not the film truly follows the real life of St. Sebastiane or what views of religion Jarman is trying to project, you can appreciate the film for its unique visual style and celebration of the male body. Here we have gorgeous tanned ripped males running around the desolute landscape in nothing but sandals and thongs (and sometimes nothing at all). The camera in slow motion captures them bathing, frolicing in the surf, riding horses, fighting and making love. This is a highly sensuous film, sometimes violent but often tender and not for those offended by homoerotica. The dialog is in Latin with English subtitles but the dialog on the whole is minimal. The only extra features on the dvd include a brief narrative text about Jarman's life and his filmography. The picture quality is superb."
3,DVD visually better quality than Video but DVD s'been edited,"It's been a number of years since I first viewed this movie as a video rental. I rented it a few times through the years although I found the quality of the video grainy and not particularly sharp the scenery is barren but stunning. I'd not viewed it in a number of years and decided to buy it when I saw it on sale and now on DVD. The viewing quality is much improved but be forewarned the DVD has been edited (which is disappointing). I'm planning to pass it on to friends. I still find it interesting, especially in study of Jarman's style through the years. I did find the new edits most disappointing. It's of course not a historically accurate film but for any serious film student or buff it is worth seeing once. I think I'd be more inclined to rent the video and not the DVD. I'd not buy it."
3,sebastiane Video,The Item arrived in good time haven't played it yet as I been to busy movin but happy with the purchase.
2,Mediocre offering; male physiques help,"An hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable, but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay, there isn't much else. Granted, there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments, but it's often dull."
3,SELF-INDULGENT,"Er, this movie is a classic and carries meaning on many levels, but I found it a bit self-indulgent and overbearing at times. Some of the scenes are just too idyllic in a silly ""swords & sandals"" type of way, while the poor Sebastian so obviously wants to be martyred that I soon lost my empathy with him. I was almost pleased when he got persecuted. And the captain who lusts after him is just too obviously of the sadist type that cannot distinguish his power lust from his desire. Some beautiful shots, though, and it is worth seeing. There is something awkward about the film, however, that makes it less than perfect. It is as if Jarman didn't keep enough distance between himself and his work, or he tried too hard to make a ""European Art Film."""
2,Expression is only the vehicle for content ...,"I felt deeply disappointed by the film, which is empty, irrelevant and self-indulgent.A lot of scenes in the movie were well arranged, sometimes sensual, defiant or narcissistic. However those images are static, hardly fluid and unsuitable for the media of motion picture. The sentiment, so, maybe too, beautifully portrayed in one split second, died quickly into the next, because of director's incapability to let those images or characters evolve and grow. Above all there is no coherent message or even an idea in the movie, except the director's own erratic obsession of beauty, moments or desire. His self-centeredness is hardly engaging to me.I can accept paintings to stress forms while defying meaning. But motion picture has one more dimension than paintings. Such waste of its expressiveness is a crime. After all, ideas are the most powerful and exciting, but not an idea of emptiness."
2,"really disappointed, don't judge a book by its cover","I was really disappointed by this book. The cover is misleading. it really is just conversations with *VERY* limited stars, and their accounts of things. I thought the book would talk more in depth about an erray of adult film stars and the stuggles they have delt with. Instead, it was more about bashing people like Savannah, and Jill Kelly's dead husband. I found a few things interesting about Traci Lords, and my own belief that she probably did all the feds on herself. Really not worth your money. I actually returned it."
5,Sensual Pleasure,If you have a sense of what is right be open with your sexuality know matter how embarrased you maybe. If you keep your eyes open you are alert. If you keep your eyes closed and you want to be an ostrich and put your head in the sand just be yourself and see how far you can go. With all that mind I digress a lot but always have good taste and make it clean. Thank You.
3,Better be careful,"Please note that the item at hand is the bound play of THE BAD SEED, not the novel. There is a paperback novel available but at this time (Aug. 2010) it costs a little more.Apparently quite a number of reviews found their way here from people who had intended to review the novel, not the play."
4,One Nasty Kid,When this book was first published it must have been particularly shocking since at that time major crime committed by children was virtually unheard of. The book still makes an impact. The thought of an 8 year old child killing people because the people have something see wants is difficult to fathom especially since the child is a little girl. The book kept me riveted. I did not give it 5 stars because Christine (the mother of the child) had discussed writing a novel about such a child with Reginald and the librarian. She also discussed the Bessie Denker case with Reginald. Bessie Denker was a serial killer who turned out to be Christine's biological mother. The librarian had discussed Christine's book with some people and told Christine what they had determined what the ending should be. That is exactly what Christine did. I would have thought that after Christine's actions that someone would have put two and two together.
4,Devilish kids are freaky,"A very disturbing tale, not only regarding the child but the generational ""curse"" the story depicts. Good for a weekend scare!"
3,A decent read,"Potentially disturbing subject matter, but a decent read. What I find most interesting is that the author was able to illustrate antisocial personality disorder so well before the term was even coined. I enjoyed this book because it didn't make me have to think too much and I wanted a ""light"" read in between the classics."
4,"Enjoyable read, but not Shakespeare.","Though it definitely has flaws (chief among them being a certain lack of subtlety on the author's part - as soon as he introduces a character, you know whether you are supposed to like, hate, or be tolerantly amused by him/her) this book definitely compares favorably to anything that's currently being put out by say, Dean Koontz. By the way, for you purists, Rhoda isn't a serial killer in the book at all (only two victims) though it discusses the cases of a number of female serial killers, real and fictional."
3,Worth Reading,"OK...I liked this book, but it was really SLOW to get going and a little bit of a disappointment. The story was good but slow. This book is on reading lists for 12-14 year olds, but I don't recommend it for that age. I do not think most early teen readers would be able to endure the slowness to get to the interesting part. Worth reading, but not excellent."
3,I wish I could give this a 3.5,"I wish I could give this book 3.5 stars. I thought Rhoda was briliantly creepy & saccharin sweet. If my spine could actually tingle it definitely would have while reading her parts. Leroy was a great character too - creepy and slimy at it's best. I think the book was at its weakest with the long exploration into Mrs. Penmark's childhood and her search for the reason why her daughter is evil. It was too overwrought, yet at the same time what I imagine any mother going through when they discover such a terrible truth about their child. I wish the book focused more on the child; she was the most fascinating part of it."
1,Airbrushing Automotive Surfaces by Pat Reynolds,A total waste of time and money. The only information provided on this tape is to remove wax from a surface prior to airbrushing and keep the nozzle of the airbrush unclogged. Duh! Other than that you waste time watching as Mr. Reynolds virtually silently airbrushes an extremely poorly done picture on the hood of a car.
2,The Civil War; Volume 3: The Narrative Red River to Part C,"As with all parts to this masterpiece, A.B.&C., the audio is a big disappointment. Fans of the author will be saddened to hear the entire work of art read by the ranger from Jellystone Park from the Yogi Bear cartoon. Extremely difficult to listen to and the package of cassettes arrived in filthy condition, which is unusual for Amazon. I could not even clean the cases, they were so dirty. The work itself is magnificent, but why pay all this money and not get Mr. Foote's voice in any of it? I would not recommend this to anyone. I recommend Mr. Foote's work to everyone. The audios are a complete bust."
3,Read all the specifications.,"These marker lights do in fact BLINK. They blink slowly. They are ideal for far away marking. Not an up close backing/parking marker.The lights themselves are way behind the time in solar Technology. Battery and LED need an upgrade. Battery replacement is difficult and it appears I damaged a wire when checking the battery.The PVC pole that extends the light to it's designed height is VERY sturdy.Mounting spike is not designed for flexibility when light is ""up"".This item should be priced in the $5 per range."
2,Beautiful But Flawed,We've had this faucet for about 2 years and over the past year it has really started to show wear. Lots of chips in the copper coating which are very obvious - not recommended for a long-term purchase. Will be replacing.
5,"Bellydance house music, finally!","I love this cd and may very well become one of my absolute favorites. I am a true househead and a pro bellydancer and I have been searching for a long time for a good fusion of the two. Well, the search is over, this is it. Tons of fun, Bellylicious can cause me to dance myself into oblivion. This is a good fusion because it is not overly-techno (high-pitched electronic with hyper-speed rhythm) and most of the tracks do not compromise the actual Arabic rhythms. The two worlds blend well so as to not sound like two neighbors blaring totally different radio stations at the same time. I don't like all of the tracks but for me, if I like a third of them on a bellydance cd it's a thumbs up, I'm just that picky about my music. I especially love ""Turkish Delight""."
4,"Bellylicious is Bellytastic! (Sorry, couldn't help it)","This CD, which has a GORGEOUS cover, is a very playful array of music(which I instantly felt when I opened the case to find a lip print on the CD). Upbeat, it instantly made me shimmy and shake all around the house! Best for when you are just in the mood to dance and want to practice just goofing around.Some of these tracks I already own on different CDs, such as The R.E.G. Project and Oojami(which seem to be very popular songs in the bellydance world), but I still enjoyed this. It includes 15 tracks, never seems to slow and just put a smile on my face with its ""enthusiasm"".While not something that I would say every dancer should own, I do think it is an excellent addition to most any dancer's collection."
3,eh---so so,"The songs themselves would have been awesome had they not been remixed. If you like beefed up techno botched in to what would have been awesome instrumental music, then ok. It had a good variety of stuff: Arabic, Bhangra, Turkish, etc."
4,As a Dancer,"This cd had some nice tracks, some alittle different than what we usually dance to that's what made it so nice. New stuff for old moves. Overall great"
4,Very Different Xmas Album,"This is a great example of a Christmas album, with a neat twist on it. There are lots of punk and ska bands featured that really make the season bright. Good gift for anyone who likes good music and Christmas time. Great songs from Great bands, you can't lose."
4,The importance of story.,"The author's approach may be upsetting to traditionalists, but he makes the stories of the Bible alive and meaningful whether you are a believer or not. The power of story a way of life is revealed throughout the book and Lane is a careful and insightful reader of the biblical stories. As one raised in the Catholic Church I find the book quite challenging because of its insistence on actually reading the stories instead of having an authority figure tell me what they mean!The book could be improved by a more careful editing job as there seem to be printing errors in some places."
4,A Good Read,"I read this book around 40 years ago and remember the stories being really scary. After reading the book again, the stories don't seem as scary, but they are still well-written and entertaining. Overall, Monster Museum is a good read for people of any age."
3,High expectations fall short...,"I had high expectations for this new Bruce box of old recordings. Sadly, the set didn't quite hit the high note. Many of the better tracks are already released B-sides. And did we really need to have Born in the USA as an acoustic version? Some of the songs, though, did put a smile on my face and bring happy memories back of days when I heard those songs at one of his concerts or when my now husband, then boyfriend, and I used to comb record shops in NYC looking for bootlegged versions of them. While I was disappointed, those memories are worth the price of admission to the box set."
5,Incredible!,"It would be nearly a crime not to run out and purchase this fantastic boxed set! Or actually, running out is no longer needed since we can run to our keyboards and connect to Amazon.com. I'm a software developer and a long time Boss fan...finding great music to write code to has been getting more difficult lately as most new music is CRAP. Songs like Dollhouse, Loose Ends and Living on the Edge of the World simply reaffirm what has been know to most of us for a long time - Springsteen is the GREATEST rocker of our generation!"
4,Almost spectacular.....,"The music is, for the most part, wonderful. My biggest problem is that it points out the tragedy of the fact that Bruce let it all slip away by ceasing to play with the E Street Band, with whom he did his best work. Hopefully, he will pick back up with his old mates and do the same caliber of work that he did in years past."
5,"Simply fantastic,","This is an amazing collection of songs spanning Bruce's entire career. Each disk focuses on a specific era, and after a week of constant listening I still havent gotten past the 2nd disk. (Personally my favorite era, the Darkness and River days) You wont be able to get ""Where the Bands Are"" out of your head."
4,Strong and gets stronger,"I just wanted to comment quickly that I disagree with those reviewers who think this boxset tails off with Bruce's late '80s and '90s work. In fact I think that material is much stronger than the more bloated girls/cars/beach/cars/cars songs, as fun as some of those are. The 3rd and 4th discs, in contrast to my original expectations, are the ones I listen to the most."
5,W-O-W!!! This set blows me away!,"I'm astonished by this genius'work...again. Bruce is the most talented, prolific, gifted singer/songwriter/musician/performer of all time. The 4 cd's haven't left my player since the day they were released. I've been a fan of his work for 20 some years, and amazingly, the effect his music has on me is evergrowing. I live in the south which isn't exactly a hotbed of Bruce fans, and I actually feel sorry for people who aren't into the gift which is Bruce's music. My appreciation for this man's work is indescribable."
4,Many great songs here,"This package shows that Springsteen could have spent much of his career releasing double albums, with no loss of quality. There are tunes from the vault that others would release as their best singles. Some really great gems here.Still, no original ""The Promise,"" no ""Because the Night,"" no ""The Fever,"" and no ""Protection"" bring down the grade a bit."
5,The Boss,"I didn't need to know any other information about this set.Unfortunately I have misplaced my much played, much loved original copy!What can I say, Bruce at his best, the old stuff really is the best!!However his newer discs are good too.Needless to say I am a big fan.If you don't have this set then buy it and listen to it all again and again and again.It will become your favourite disc."
4,A fascinating retrospective,"If anything, Tracks gives fans of the Boss an amazing look at one artist's development and growth. It also magnifies Bruce's tendency to beat certain themes and musical ideas into the ground, which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5. Don't get me wrong -- I'm still a huge fan. But if you listen objectively, you'll hear it by the time you get to Disc 4. Those songs just don't hold up to the songwriting on the first three discs, and I doubt that even a couple songs on Disc 4 will ever be remembered with the same fondness as ""Thundercrack,"" ""Shut Out the Light,"" ""Where the Bands Are,"" just to name a few. On Tracks, the exuberance of youth, rebellion, frustration and romance of rock n roll shines through on the first three discs. Listen to ""Give the Girl a Kiss"" and you can't help but smile. Maybe Bruce should listen to it himself as a refresher."
5,The CD I have been waiting for for years...,"Unbelievable CD, it is great to hear Bruce from the early 70's to the 90's. Has all the songs I was hoping for even if my wife thought I spent too much money on it."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,Bruce is back! He has once again brought the music world back to the days of unbridled rock-n-roll. There is not one bad song in the entire set. Bruce is truely the master of lyrical poetry. Thanks Bruce!!
5,burning on--disc 3,"The pleasure of these songs. Bruce fills these songs, missing no more chances. He fills up ""This Hard Land"" with the brush of a kiss. He fills ""Frankie"" with the driving sway of the music. He fills it all with intelligence and joy. Look at this guy: We're all swimming upstream like salmon. We all have our glory days young. We do our best work wet behind the ears. Same with Bruce--go back and listen to the first cd. Then we run out of guts and float belly-up back to sea. Not Bruce. He swims on upstream through this cd, burning on against the current that puts out all our fires. And besting his best works. Listen to ""Rockaway the Days""--how is this so much with so little? And in ""When You Need Me"", how does he fit more and more into what begins so simply? Two big mysteries near the end: At the end of ""The Honeymooners"", how does the musc swallow you like that, like the sea swallows a man tied to a piano? And in ""The Wish"", how does the red guitar linger so bright?"
3,one song in three strong,"I'm a big fan, but to me there weren't many new favorites to find here. Most of the best songs are the already-released B-sides. There are too many Go-Go's-sounding rockers, and ballads that can't redeem an embarassing main idea. All are too earnest to be enjoyed as throwaways, as with Dylan, but instead come off as failed epics. Having said all this, the singing is great throughout. And in addition to the B-sides, there are a bunch of moving songs, especially on the last (90's) disc, and a handful of remarkable and risky ones. Anyway, Tom Joad made the future look bright."
5,THIS is the Best Boss Album...,"The albums that never were...There is so much to embrace here. My focus as a fan especially of the E Street Band's earlier work (saw many of these same songs performed live in the early 80's, and then they never saw the light of day), is the GREAT stuff left off of ""Darkness..."" and ""The River"" and the famous unreleased whole album, the Born in the USA-circa ""Murder, Incorporated""...standouts like ""Bring on the Night"", ""Don't Look Back"", ""Dollhouse"", ""Loose Ends"", ""Wages of Sin"", ""Take 'Em as They Come"", ""Cynthia"", ""Frankie""...""The Rising?"" Forget it. Go here for the REAL stuff...just like it was back in 1980, 5th Row, Kiel Opera House...4 1/2 hours of hope, faith and glory. And that ain't no Glory Days ""sir""..."
3,It left me wanting my other CDs,"While I waited with anticipation for this set, when I finally listened to it, I was disappointed. While there are some curiosities, they don't hold a candle to the real albums. I'll stick with my Darkness and River CDs!"
4,It's about time...but definitely worth it,"Most die-hard fans have the majority of the songs, but this is truly an excellent package. Could have left out Pink Cadillac, and included some live cover tunes. Can't wait for something similar in the future; he has plenty of other songs in his repertoire. I'm really excited for the tour"
5,Great,"Brilliant collection that's as good as the studio albums. Unlike the famous albums, which sometimes sound over-produced, there's a rawness and freshness to all this which lets the songs speak."
2,Mostly second rate material,I love Springsteen's work but this is the dregs of the aforementioned. I compiled the entire 4 CD's onto a single CD that has all that I considered worth listening to on it! And the CD had lots of free space!Alas a once great Rock and Roll star has turned himself into a left wing mouthpiece alienating his work from his hardworking American fanbase. Oh Bruce I marvel at the hypocrisy of advocating open US borders when you live in gated community. I wonder how much of the Diversity you advocate for others is bestowed upon your children? In summary here is yet another hypocritial Democrat who talks a good game but actually lives life more like a Republican. Still cannot see just where he lost the plot and abandoned his culture and identity for the endorsement of the beautiful people.
4,Each of the 4 c.d.'s could have been a standout single release,"I purchased this set when it was released in '98 and listened to it a couple of times, liked it, and then didn't listen to it again until April of 2009.Maybe I have too many c.d.'s, or possibly my 4 kids diverted my attention, but I can't believe I'd forgotten how good this collection is.It's difficult to summarize a 66 track set, but from '72 through '95 Springsteen's artistic powers were such that even the unreleased material exemplified here is uniformly excellent and only comparable to the first volumes of the Dylan Bootleg series. This boxed set is truly a stunning achievement."
4,A glimpse into the creative process,"This collection of previously unreleased material is the first official release by Springsteen from his legendary collection.Tracks is amazing because it is not just a collection of outtakes or songs that did not meet Bruce's very high standards.It illustrates the creative and commercial evolution of one of music's great artists. We can hear in Mary Queen of Arkansas and many of the tracks on disc one, a young man with a remarkable gift to tell a story and convey emotion.In the many other tracks Bruce reveals his creative process. I have a great time trying to place lyrics and riffs that show up in many of the songs in which we are more familiar.Most importantly, all four discs are filled with wonderful music that will not disappoint any of Bruce's fans. This is not a collection just for the audiophile. It is an accessible and enjoyable collection of music from a true rock legend."
2,Too Little Too Late,Tracks should have been released 10 years ago. Most Springsteen collectors already have the bulk of what is here. Sorry to see Bruce joining the ranks of those issueing material just to make a buck! Too Little Too Late sorry to say!
3,I am very confusing,"I cannot decide whether this one is great or not. But I must confess that I was not so happy when I actually heard this one as I had expected when I had heard the news of this one. Yes, there are many great music. But after all, Rock'n'Roll should be the music of today or future. And, once, Bruce was said to be the future of Rock'n'Roll. I hope him to be the same today. But these songs are all about yesterday. He did the Live album, Best album, and Outtake album. It's enough for me. I love ""Lucky Town"" ""Tom Joad"" and Tom Joad's tour. They are not about yesterday. Please Bruce, don't do the Re-Union kind of tour. Just do the new tour of you and your E-Street band. I believe you can do magic."
2,they got it right the first time,"rather than gem after gem, this project seems to need an outside editor-bruce and co have included all the average to below ideas with the good and great. as you might expect, the first two discs are the best, but even these discs pale against the previously released product. i used to rail against critics who thought springsteen was a flawed major artist or a gifted minor figure. now i suspect this is right. my verdict? stick with the 6-8 classics bruce has produced and get a friend to tape about 1/5 of this lumbering set."
1,Who Designs the Packaging on These Things?,"Okay, I realise this is judging a book by its cover, but ... I can't help myself. I just saw Tracks -- and the music is terrific. But what gumby designed the appalling packaging? It's surely gonna fall apart in 2/10ths of a second leaving us with once again having to buy cd cases to store the cd's while our expensive boxed sets fall apart. It don't make sense."
4,4 1/2 really,"The only songs that are really good are Loose ends and Be true, yet I have had this only for a month. Get it i guss..."
3,one in three songs strong,"I'm a big fan, but to me there aren't many new favorites to be found here. Most of the best songs are the already-released B-sides. There are too many Go'Go's-sounding rockers, and ballads that can't redeem their embarassing main idea. All are too earnest to be enjoyed as throwaways; they come off as failed epics, and the whole is too produced to be a warts-and-all. This said, the singing is great throughout. And in addition to the B-sides, there are a bunch of moving songs, especially on the last (90's) disc, and a handful of remarkable and risky ones. Anyway, Tom Joad bodes well for the future."
5,The album of the decade!,"After listening to the 4 CD's today, I am surprised how it could take this long to release such brilliant songs. What Bruce found not good enough for his 'regular' albums, would be the highlight for most other artists. Songs like 'I wanna be with you' or 'Brothers under the Bridges' prove why they call him the Boss. It's his best album in the last 10 years! Looking forward to see him on the road!"
5,"This is a critical retrospective, long overdue.","Bruce has finally taken the steps to give his true fans the opportunity to hear this long-lost music with the quality and studio mixing which his fans deserve. For years, many of us have become familiar with many of these newly released tracks as bootlegged. We have endured the imperfections which have taken away from the musical quality. With the ""release"" of Bruce's PRODIGAL SON in 1995, the few of us who actually got our hands on this CD (released for one day, on a temporary basis, dating back to his infamous Appel-Landau battles of 1974 for the rights to his music), could hear this music so clearly. This album provides many nice surprises, enchantment and captures the spirit of Bruce as he was ""growin' up"" to be the major influence that he has become on the music scene. Run to the stores - or onto the Web - to buy it...it's that terrific!! Review by Ralph in New Jersey"
5,Beautiful Harmonies and Vocalizations,"Like another reviewer, I am thrilled at Lo! He Comes, as well as with the unfamiliar setting for Hark the Herald Angels Sing and the beautiful Sing We the Virgin Mary.If you love beautiful vocalizations, especially rare soprano-alto harmonizations, this is the album for you."
4,Unique and special,Loved this album the entire thing. An English flavour.Especially loved the Lo He Comes With Clouds Descending..heart stirring. A great way to get into the Christmasspirit and lift your heart.
5,Totally worked!,"I was skeptical that any of these ultrasonic devices would actually work at all. But, I have to say, this unit, the Rodar II, totally got the job done. I'm impressed. I had a squirrel problem in my attic, and this one pesky bugger just loved waking me up on early weekend mornings. The day I placed the Rodar II in my attic was the last day I ever heard of Mr. Squirrel. He left for the much quieter neighbor's house. Like it says here, the unit is practically silent. You can faintly here a very very light clicking, but in my attic, it's all but forgotten. I just leave it plugged in up there all the time, and now I can get some needed extra sleep on weekends. The unit itself is small. For some reason, I had gotten the idea that it was much larger in the pictures here, but that's likely because there's nothing to reference it's scale to. It easily fits behind ductwork in your attic or basement. It has a reasonably long AC power cord too, so you'll likely not need an extension cord."
4,very effective product,"i struggled for 2 months to get rid of mice in my basement and kitchen. i put one of this in the basement and within a couple of days i noticed a significant decrease in mice activity. some of the mice tried to adapt by going inside the walls. so i really had no choice but to also use poison (ramik bars) and i no longer have mice. i recommend this product, it will keep the mice away but if you trully need to get rid of them, well you might also need to use poison. Also, don't forget to plug in all the holes with steel wool."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this 3 weeks ago with the hope that I could fix my mouse problem here, no insects just mice.So I put it down in the basement directly facing where the mice were coming in, and it seemed to be working (I didn't see anything) the other night though I went downstairs and sure enough I saw a mouse.I decided to move the Rodar into the room with the problem, and last night I saw one walk right past it and not effect.I have a cat and he has caught some of them but I didn't want to have to resort to poison / traps because it gets messy.Now I guess I should have spent the 20-30$$ and not bothered with this, and I did talk to an pest control guy and he said that for the most part they don't work otherwise he would be using them.if I could rate this lower than one star I would."
4,No squirrels in the walls,"It's impossible to tell if the device is on or working except by the results. We haven't heard any squirrels in the wall since we installed it. So, it's a keeper."
1,No effect,I can not tell any difference.. They go right past it like it isn't there. What a waste of my money - I should have given it to the government - same result!
3,I'm not sure yet! The verdict is still out,"I don't want to say it doesn't work. I don't want to say it does. I still hear the squirrels but not as often. I was under the impression, I wouldn't hear anymore squirrels. Following the instructions fully, I'm hoping I will see a difference. Either these squirrels are bolder or this Rodar II signal needs to be stronger."
2,Need something more powerful,"Mouse are having party inside the ceiling of my bedroom every night.I tried pest control company but they did nothing helpful but left dozens of sticky mouse traps, so I searched around and found this product.I could tell that mouse are a little quiet than before since RODAR II plugged in two month ago, but several are still there, just no happy feet any more. this is the reason I gave more than one star.Now I wish the product is more powerful to get rid of those bad guys completely instead of cooling them down."
3,good condition but it was a library book,"I purchased this book to give to a little boy for his birthday. I received it and although it was in great condition, it had a library bar code on the back as well as several ""King County Library"" stamps on the inside cover, title page and last page!"
4,Nice B edtime Read,"My 2yr old twins and 1yr all enjoyed the book. The pictures are bright and colourful. I know they enjoyed a book when they take it from me after we've read it together and they ""read"" it to themselves and they did with this story."
3,Disappointed,I found myself skimming over much of this book. Before I purchased it I read the reviews and probably expected something different. Plot was interesting but it did not move at a fast pace.
3,"It fits for students of engineering, but...","I'm a student in EE dep of Seoul natl univ in korea, and have taken a class using this book, named 'Engineering mathematics 3' which deals linear algebra. The author introduced a little bit practical topics, rather than purely mathematical concepts. Thus one can easily trace what he wanna tell just by solving the solved-problems in text even without reading the contents. (And also in my oppinion, this book really contains lots of errors, so you must be careful of that.) When you've not got enough time to familiar with this subject, then I recommand this. If not, walk around and pick another text. I hope this review might be helpful. Thanx for reading."
5,"Neighbour to the moon, ambassador to the stars...",""" After Years of thirst, a voice like fresh water has arrived. A cloud, a love letter from another planet: Fairuz has overwhelmed us with ecstasy. Names and figures of speech remain too small to define her. She alone is our agency of goodwill to which those of us looking for love and poetry belong. When Fairouz sings, mountains and rivers follow her voice, the mosque and the church, the oil jars and loaves of bread. Through her, every one of us is made to blossom, and once we were no more than sand; men drop their weapons and apologize. Upon hearing her voice, our childhood is molded anew.""Nizar Qabani"
1,Bad product,The compass does not work. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do not buy! Do not buy!
2,Way over priced,"I bought the SAME unit at Walmart for $3.00, and still feel ripped of. The biner is ok as a key holder, but the compass is useless. It does not work."
3,"a bit tight, but nice","It's good quality, good price, but tight. I wish mine was larger. Iwear it under my motorcycle helmet for warmth."
1,horrible,im not a big fan of no doubt but i know that when i hear bad music it is bad music. 13 dollars to waste on this single. i bet denis rodman sings better. Yuck!
3,Suspence and model trains collide in this action thriller,"This is a fun, suspenseful, cryptic movie. Eight strangers come together in a dark, creepy house by an English railyard, Three intend to make off with a stolen piece of jewelry.The acting is good and the story advances quickly from murder mystery to thriller.Two segments make this movie worth watching. First there is the empty house. Hitchcock, through slow-moving cameras and great use of lighting, creates a haunting atmosphere and builds nearly unbearable suspense.The second must-see is the final chase scene. Hitchcock uses miniatures to convey most of the action: a train, a bus, a ferry, and even a motorcycle. The expert editing of the scene saves the special effects (which are reminiscent of old Godzilla movies) and makes for great pacing."
2,"Tight fit, mediocre sound","I bought the neckband headphones because my clip-over-ear headphones always get tangled in my bag. They look and feel really nice. But sound quality was disappointing and barely comparable to the stock ipod headphones. Frankly the fit is tight, even for my small head. The system to hook to your ears requires a sort of a clumsy fumbling to make them work. If you plan on using them on a treadmill or while jogging, be aware that the bouncing motion pulls them down on your ears, which can be uncomfortable during vigorous exercise."
4,Good Headphones,"I use these headphones while running on a treadmill. They live in my gym bag and hold up just fine. They do the trick and sound good. They are not the perfect headphone so I did NOT give it 5 stars, but then again I have not found the perfect headphone so 4 out of 5 is the best."
3,"Great sound, uncomfortable, look ridiculous","These headphones sound great (for the price) but I found them uncomfortable and to add insult to injury, stupid looking. The outer portion of the headphone looks suspiciously like a car rim is painted to look like carbon fiber. Carbon fiber?"
5,not bad at all,"soundstage is wider, highs are more open and bass is more prominent.i noticed a difference after break in and like these much more than the px100s (black edition).these are very enjoyable to listen to for the price they cant be beat.clamp force is stronger than px 100s which some users may find fatiguingaudiophiles look elsewhere.get some grados....i use these as my portable headphones, they sound awesome"
4,Great Product,"I really like these headphones.Pros: Good base as well as execelent trebble response, lightweight, comfortable for several hours and so far durableCons: They do not fold (well the ear pads fold sideways to keep from breaking the speakers when stored), the plug that goes into the player comes out striaght up and does not bend at a 90 degree. This can be annoying when working out or walking as the cord sticks into your side if placed on your belt.I would have given these 5 stars excecpt for the plug's poor design."
3,"high hopes, but no cigar","I am constantly looking for better portable headphones that I can use while riding my bicycle on a daily basis. My audio drawer at home is filled with also-rans. I was looking replace my aging Sony G72 LP's that I have been using for 4 years. I listen mainly to classical choral music on these rides. The PMX 100's are worthy portable headphones, but they tend to ""color"" the sound over its natural timbre. Excellent bass and spaciousness, but the coloring overshadows the strengths. Their open air design certainly adds to the spaciousness of the sound, but if you use them as I do, the wind noise, a byproduct of the open air nature of the phones, is a distinct drawback."
5,Love These Headphones,I've had these for over a year. I can use them for hours at a time with no discomfort. The sound quality is very good when compared to similarly priced headphone.
2,Great sound. Shoddy design.,"I started using these headphones immediately. They conformed pretty well, sounded fantastic. I thought ""$40? small price to pay for great sound, comfort, and even cool looking headphones."" But I spoke too soon. The cord that comes out of the mini-jack is already coming apart. Medium wear and 2 weeks of use = $40? I don't think so. Sennheiser may not get my business ever again with build quality so poor. They sound good, feel comfortable, and aren't super expensive...but if you want to use them for more than a week, look elsewhere."
5,Ditto the general consensus,"Excellent sound, with ample bass, good color, solid definition--I could easily make out details I hadn't heard with the stock iPod earbuds or my last pair of cheaply constructed Sony Fontopias. They seam geared towards rock, but they handle everything I've thrown at them, across a pretty wide spectrum, quite well. I'm using them as my everyday headphones now, and they've been handling a train commute and plenty of briefcase abuse with no worries. That said, the comfort could stand to be a bit better (although it's nitpicking, really, because they aren't awful in that department, either), and the aesthetics leave much to be desired, but they do sound good, appear to be durable, and are cheap, cheap, cheap. An excellent choice for most people."
4,Review for YA Class of Gidget,"This book is fantastic and sheds a different light on my misconceptions of Gidget just being guy crazy and not into surfing for surfing's sake. I particularly enjoyed the ending. What was really great about this book is that it is a fantastic coming of age novel about a little girl, who wanted to grow up too soon, (what teenager doesn't?). It must have been shocking when it first came out, and still, it's amazing anyone's father could write this book, knowing many of the intimate details of his daughters teenage romantic life."
5,Great short easy read,This was an entertaining book. I just wish it was longer. I wish I had 10 books as fun and enjoyable as this one. Reading this book will make you feel like you know what is was like for a 15 year old girl to be having a great summer in the 50s
2,Bum lamp!,"Hopefully the replacement will work just fine. It was clear from the packaging, however, that the same lamp had already been sold at least once and returned, presumably for being defective !"
2,Great lamp--lousy price,"I bought this lamp years ago from like OfficeMax or Staples or somewhere. I still have it--it looks great and works like a champ. My wife was looking for one and came across this listing on Amazon for the same lamp. Problem is, I paid about $25 for this lamp and it's now selling for $100, which is completely outrageous. I don't know why the dimmable desk lamp market has all but dried up (at least sub $100) but it's too bad that this lamp is so expensive now."
5,Great lamp at a great price,"I wanted a desk lamp with an updated look and superior lighting. This certainly meets my criterion and more. The on/off switch is also a dimmer, so the lamp offers nice ligting when working in the room but not right at the desk. Did my homework, and the price is better than most. I recommend it without reservation."
1,"Poor Quality, Not As Bright As Expected","Was hoping for a decent quality desk lamp. Thought this would be it due to the price point.Build quality is low. Lamp arrived with scratches on the base and on the top. Knob is loose. Does not lock securely in place - the lamp came down one day and ruined my phone by melting the case of the phone (it is VERY hot near the bulb).Light output is also less than expected. It has a 100-watt halogen bulb, but the lamp puts out about the same light as another desk lamp that I have with a 50-watt halogen bulb.I ordered another, because I could not believe how bad it was, and the new one was actually worse. Sent that back, but I'm stuck with the original.Recommend to avoid regardless of the price."
4,BRIGHT LIGHT,This lighht was a replacement for a defective one. It has a variable control from off to 100 watt brightness. The only problem is this control is hard to work. The other one has a smooth working control.
2,Unaceptable,"The song ""Intruder"" was one of the singles of this album, and it was played on Headbangers ball back in the day. I really liked Intruder, it was in your face hardcore, and Billy Milano's voice sounds strong and agressive, so i went out and bought the album....I felt really let down by all the other tracks except Intruder, and certainly didint sound like the first M.O.D. albums that are much better than this one. If you wanna get anything with Billy in it, get S.O.D or the first 2 M.O.D albums."
1,Rhythm of Fear,"Rhythm of Fear fails to deliver. It's mostly unentertaining and boring. My favorite songs were: Dead End, Rally(NYC), Get Up And Dance, and Step By Step is alright. The problem is 2/3 of the best songs are already on M.O.D.'s Loved By Thousands...Hated By Millions plus even better tracks."
3,not the best they could have done,this cd has some good songs on it but they don't put their best foot forward to speak. these songs with the musicans(not the songs) on devoultion would have made this cd 100% better with tim mcmuiry still on guitar as a five piece band.
5,My Blitzkreig Bop,"I've been addicted to George Tabb now for almost 6years. It started with MRR, then Playing Right Field, and now, here comes his biggest masterpiece Surfing Armageddon. This book in all it's hilarity is genuine, serious, and heart warming. It really is hard to put down cause his life is that amazing."
3,Questionable,"I'm a Civil Engineering technician and have thoughts of owning this watch. Upon observation at my local Dakota Store. This watch is not intuitive to use, and the instruction manual is just a folded 11""x17"" sheet of paper with several foreign languages in 8pt. font type. With a bare user navigation map. The store manager was not even familiar with this watch. I could not find how to set the compass longitude and latitude per USGS or NOAA websites, or if the watch even has the capibility for this input. I give this 3 stars, so save your time and money!"
4,A touching story,"This movie is a heartwarming story about sisters. When they are young, Faith, (Cameron Diaz) and Pheobe,(Jordana Brewster),have a lot of fun times together as a family. But when their father dies, everything seemed to change. Faith started skipping school, getting into drugs and so on. Soon, when she is 18 her and her boyfriend wolf, (Christopher Eccleston) plan a trip to Europe and try to change the world with politicians. Soon after, Faith is misteriously dead and Pheobe, when she is older, dedicates her time and money to go out and find out whar REALY happened."
4,worthy addition to the series,"As with all anthologies, some stories are better than others and as with all FR anthologies the veteran authors's stories are better than the nobodies's. I've been into this series in a big way, getting to be a big mel Odom fan, and this collection of stories does a great job showing how big a deal the sea war is to Faorun. Best stories rae by Lyn Abbey and Elaine Cinningham, also Keith Strom and you HAVE to read Mel Odom's story if your reading the trilogy!"
3,A collaboration of tales of a monster,this book contains many tales which are both intrigueing and dissatisfying. It reminds you of a book where you are interested in the end yet not satisfied. Most forgotten Realms books have proven to be the best yet this is a mild dissapointment.
2,Disappointing,"Years after falling in love with this musical at a London performance, I bought this CD to bring back the memories. Unfortunately, it only tainted them. The recording sounds flat, the performances are operatically overblown, and the choral arrangements quickly become annoying. Maybe I just remembered the original stage performance as being better than it was."
3,Not Bright Enough,"This is not bright enough , if you are looking for a stimulating Brighlight; (for SAD or nightshift); I got the Bluemax and its working out great."
3,"works, but not as depicted","the relay works for the application of dimmer relay, but it is not as shown on the outside of the relay housing. there is only 1 set of contacts and it is not a mechanical latching relay, but an electrical latch that reverts to the normally closed position when power is removed."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read!,"This is the best book! If you ever have had a dog, you can relate to this sad story. it is hard not to cry!!"
2,"Nice looking, but some parts were missing/didn't fit","I got this for a great price as some deal-o'-the-day and I was pleased.. until it arrived. 2 screws that secure the bottom shelf to the legs were missing and the peg that keeps the drawer from coming out of the front didn't stay in it's place. The drawer was also a pain to put together square.All-in-all, it's an OK 30-dollar-ish item, but if you have the capital to get something a bit nicer, I'd go for it.It looks fine, and other than the drawer falling out and the bottom shelf not being secure, it does it's job of holding my alarm clock and a small lamp."
3,Ok for price but a little disappointed,"First off, I was impressed at how quickly I received this-both times, more on that to follow-especially as it was the week before Christmas. However, the first one came without instructions or hardware, aka we got a box of wood. We got a return authorization, reordered, and the 2nd one came in 2 days. 2nd one had instructions and hardware but 2 pieces of the drawer had small cracks. I know it was only $35 but it still shouldn't be broken. I was also grateful that Amazon took it back easily and quickly shipped a replacement. We first decided to contact Winsome Wood directly to have them send us instructions and hardware-they estimated that would have taken 2-4 weeks to arrive which was unacceptable."
1,Assembling this is a pain,"The table looks good, the sides though looked scratched but its not that visible since its black.Assembling this took me and my sister 4.5 hrs, such a waste of time. Literally took me to the peak of my frustration levels.The instructions were clear and easy to understand but there was something up with the screws and holes.I have blisters in my hands, if you don't have a strong man in the house to assemble this please don't buy it.After everything the end product is kinda unstable and flimsy. I like the look but it jst shakes now :(Not worth all the trouble."
3,"Cute, but lots of scrapes and missing paint.","Who had the bright idea of shipping the item in its original manufacturers box, without additional packing? One side of the stand is all scuffed up, missing lots of paint.But for $29.99 and prime shipping, I'm not complaining too loud. I needed this thing."
1,"Missing 40% of the parts, and NO 1-800 number!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I rarely leave a bad review, but this is ridiculous! It is missing literally 40% of the parts that it was supposed to come with. This may not sound like a huge deal if you don't mind calling the 1-800 number to tell them to send out the parts, except for when you realize that the COMPANY DOESN'T EVEN OFFER YOU A 1-800 NUMBER TO CALL!!! They only leave you a slip of paper to fill out and send in, with it specifically telling you to expect 2-4 WEEKS before shipment of missing parts! And since it would be about $30 to return the item to Amazon (and it only costs $50 for the table), I'm basically SOL. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
3,Good for the price,"The stand looks exactly like it does in the picture when assembled, and it's not a bad piece of furniture at all. My problem with it is that it arrived scratched on three different areas. Not small scratches, either, but large and prominent scratches. Luckily I had a black wood marker around or I would have been very upset. So be prepared to have to touch up the black finish a bit... at this price, I'm sure their workers are not worrying much about damaging the furniture."
3,Not bad for the price!,I bought 2 of these in black. They were easy to assemble. My only complaint was that there were scratches on one of them...and when you order stuff online..who wants to take the time to ship it back and get another one in. I kept it and used a black sharpy. For the price they are decent.
2,Horrible quality,"I didn't open this and put it together until 5 months after I bought it, so I didn't know how bad of shape it was and I would have sent it back if I'd known. It came with dinged up part that had paint chips and unfinished pieces(paint unfinished) and most of the parts had holes that didn't line up so I had to drill new ones in. It also had a entire missing screw so I had to find one that would work. Big disappointment."
4,Great for the price,Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. If you want cheap end tables these would be great for you. Took me about 30 minutes to assemble by myself.
4,Good night table,Good table that has a good height... came in solid packaging and the instructions were very simple. I just wish it was a little heavier so it would be more stable and not shake violently when i bump into it. Still for the price it was well worth it
4,Not to bad,"I received this very quickly, 2 days to be exact. It was missing one of the phillips head screws used to assemble, but I purchased a different drawer pull anyways so it didn't effect the assembly for me. It was difficult to screw in the legs to the top portion and I have one screw that sticks out a little bit, but not too noticeable. The wood looks pretty good and mine came smooth and all one finish with no blemishes...some of the screw holes were a bit off - but thankfully the wood is soft and it can be assembled without this being a major issue, its only a burden.I think with the knob upgrade, it adds a lot to the piece b/c it can fit your decor more, if you want traditional vs contemporary vs shabby chic - it can be done with this one simple step and it only costs a couple of bucks."
2,Winsome Wood Tables,The tables that I ordered came in a timly manner. However they were not of good quality. I kept them anyway and put tall lamps on them to ditract from the tops that were not good quality.
1,Came with a hole in it.,The product was perfect except that the top surface had a hole in it on the left hand side. It seemed the manufacture drilled the primer hole too deep.
3,Worth The Price,"For under 40 bucks I didn't have unrealistic expectations about what I was buying, especially after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleased when the table was put together, which took me all of 25 mins, it's sturdy, functional, and looks good, I did have some slight issues with the holes not lining up when the legs are being put on, but, all that needs to be done is to keep all bolts loose,especially the two pieces that screw to the underside of table top, not so loose where it will fall apart but loose enough so the parts move slightly, that way all the holes will line up, then, when your all done with the assembly go back and give all the bolts a final tightening.I guess I was lucky my table didn't have any flaws in the finish."
2,you get what you pay for,"The quality of this product is not-so-great, and it was difficult to put together since the holes were drilled so poorly. This might be okay for a guest room but I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use."
2,Looks Good But..........,"Its a great table for the price,sturdy enough for a bedside table, but it was missing the drawer front."
2,Beware of product!,This product had many screws but four of them made it difficult to put together as they were in a hard to access area. You better make sure your putting it together right because you can't get the screws out. It was too small for me once I put together and I cant return. Those 4 screws are in for good and the item would cost too much to ship back put together. Beware!!
4,winsome end table,"Nice table for price. Drawer doesn't always go in squarely so put everything together carefully. use a carpeted or cloth covered surface so you don't scratch the pieces when putting htem together. aLso be mindful of which screws you are using... if you use the ones that are too long to affix the top, you will put holes through it. I ordered drawer pulls to match my decor. All in all, a good product that I would buy again. I have also purchase the winsome saddle bar stools and enjoy those as well."
3,very good for the price,I bought two of these and they went together pretty easy with only one slight alignment problem that will easily be fixed with shoe polish or a black felt pen. Before I bought these I read and reread some of the reviews as to the problems people had putting these together. They look nice and do not forget the extra wood square dowel it mekes it much better. The reason for only three stars is the finish. It is not sealed and rubs off on your hands. A can of spray laquer will fix that but it should have been done by the manufacturer.
4,Nice little table,"I bought to be used as a printer tray...it's not a fancy pants end-table, but looks just nice enough. Sturdy, and well built for a pre-fab piece....If you are looking for something cheap and functional this is perfect.Was a bit of a hassel to assemble, but if you have a electric drill w/ bits it can be done in under 20 minutes."
5,Pleasant Surprise!,"Wow, what a great surprise at the quality of this nightstand. It was easy to put together and it was sturdy and you get plenty of usable space with having the tabletop, drawer and shelf below. I am ordering 3 more! Great value, doesn't look cheap at all. I have the black one."
4,Nice table for the price,I have had it for about two months and it is good for an inexpensive nightstand. It was relatively easy to put together. Pretty sturdy.
2,"Small, inexpensive table","I originally bought a pair of these tables as end tables for my living room, and was going to put my large end tables into my office, but, after assembling them, realized that they were VERY SMALL and barely meet the requirements of ""adult sized"" furniture. MINIATURE is a good word for this product. Had to level the legs on both tables. Solid for $32. Would cost more to return them than I paid for them, so I'll make them work, for now."
3,cheap,"Cheap as in quality and price. I bought two and it was a pain in the butt to put it together and it looks/feels a little shoddy. Still hasn't fallen apart since I bought it in May, so I guess that's good..."
2,Came with broken leg,"It came with broken leg. I do not think it got damaged in transport. Looks like some one returned it(because of damage), and they send it to me with out verifying it.Table itself is not strong, but it is cheep."
3,Gud overall,"Suffice the requirement perfectly for small coffee table/laptop table, good quality, easy to clean. Worth the price..! Go 4 it."
3,Not bad,"Ordered two of these in black. They will do the job but nothing special, you get what you pay for. Had some defects."
5,Great value for the price,I purchased two of these little tables for my livingroom. They arrived quickly and in excellent condition. They are fairly easy to assemble and look great in our house!
1,lots of scratches and a broken leg,"when I opened the package, one of the legs was broken and it looks like someone had glued it together. lots of scratches and visible chips. doesn't look like it happened during the delivery process. they just intentionally sent me a broken one hoping I wouldn't notice..but they are too big to be not noticed.."
1,impossible to assemble correctly,"I'm sure it would be a pretty and functional table if it would assemble correctly, but the screws included won't tighten all the way, which makes the table wobbly. The allen wrench included ended up stripping the screws instead of tightening them, and when I went to assemble the drawer, the pre-drilled holes were in the wrong place on one side of the panel, meaning I would have had to drill my own holes in order to get the screws to go where they needed to. I eventually gave up on the drawer and I'm using the table without it, but it is still too wobbly to hold anything more than a light lamp or a book. Very disappointing..."
3,Manufacturing issue but still LOVE IT!,"These tables fit perfect next to my bed. The drawers are super long!They are shorter than i expected but add caster's if you need the height.The only complaint we have is that one table's drawer did not push in to be flush with the frame as it should be & as it is on the 2nd table. A little handy work from my hubby & perfect!Overall I'm happy with these tables, especially at the price!"
4,Amazing,I love this item! I was so excited to get it in the mail and when it came I built it and put it in my room and it was amazing! I love these tables!
3,meh...,"Its made out of cheap material the holes dont line up that well mine had small scratches and the drawer has no wheel its just wood on wood but it looks nice from far away, it is kind of small too, it almost looks like miniature furniture next to my bed"
5,perfect condition,"I purchased two (black). Both arrived quickly, without a single scratch, nick, touch-up job, crack, etc. All holes were alligned correctly and to the appropriate depth, although it seemed like I had to tighten the longer screws forever (once as I built it, once afterwards as the table was upright). make sure you use the correct end of the wrench in order to get the best leverage! As a female with pretty much no furniture putting-together experience, I finished the first in 40 minutes and the second in 30, without the aid of another person. $36. No wood veneers. I'm rather happy."
2,Night stand,Looks alright but not very sturdy. I can't even tighten the screws. We get what we paid I suppose will sum this up :(
3,Looks nice but....,Looks nice but not very sturdy and came with a few scratches. But I guess you get what you pay for!
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with the Winsome Wood night stand. I ordered two of them for my bedroom. They were fairly straightforward to put together. They are nice looking pieces, and they were a great value for the price. I would recommend them if you're looking for simple nightstand without paying major furniture prices."
5,Black End Table,Purchased 2 of these. They are easy to assemble. The wood is more of a stain than a paint. Some of the wood grain shows through. Well made and worth the price. They look great.
4,Price is about right,"The finish is much darder than in the photo. This is not a high quality table,the finish is thing and marks up easily, you get what you pay for..."
4,"Solid wood furniture, solid quality","These are pretty solid little pieces of furniture. They're a little low - check the dimensions before purchasing, but work great with our modern, low furniture. The quality is better than I thought it would be for the price. The top surface is solid wood, and the drawer is adequately sized and helpful. We have a little one on the way and we like the rounded corners - very kid friendly."
4,solid tables for the money,"Winsome Wood End Table/Night Stand with Drawer and Shelf, BlackI bought two of these tables for my husband's ""mancave"". They are very sturdy and nice looking. A little challenging to put together with the hex wrench that comes with the package. I used a cordless drill with a hex bit."
5,Great little table for the price,I purchased 2 of these tables and was surprised how good they look for the price. Nothing you will get from a high-end furniture store but Hey! it was $40.00.I had to put the table together but it was very easy. It is very sturdy and looks good.I think a good purchase.
4,Got 4 and they are great!,"These little end tables are great.They were really easy to put together....I would say it took me around 5 or 6 minutes...used a powertool to put it together.They are made of real wood, not venner and fiberboard like other furniture and it will have its own differences, ever so slightly but that gives it character.I would have given it 5 stars but I received one with a white inner drawer base which I just spray painted black (i ordered the black ones), not a big deal. But a little quality control issues there. I don't doubt Amazon would have made it right for me but it was an easy fix."
1,Wish I had it to review,"I have not received this item. Amazon tells me to contact the company. Techni-Tool pretty much tells ""too-bad."" This purchase was a mistake."
5,It's the BEST,"Crouching Tiger is a movie where you need to look between the lines. It's not really obvious unless you've watched it 5 million times, like I have. It's great to have a DVD of this movie because you want to be able to watch this again and again and again..."
3,But Chinese People Can't Fly,"It may well be that this story comes to us from the great and time honored tradition of Chinese epic sagas, but for this American movie-goer, it seemed to come more from the tradition of the old Hercules movies, or perhaps some exaggerated continuation of the Bruce Lee series. I've known many Chinese people in my life and if any of them could fly, one of them would surely have tipped me off to this fact. .Personally, I found all of the flying around and the incredible fighting skills to be distracting, but I had prepared myself to see one of the year's greatest films. Perhaps if I had begun the movie with no preconceived ideas and lower expectations, I'd have enjoyed it more. I'd recommend that you see this movie, but don't get into it expecting greatness, unless, perhaps, you are much more familiar with the genre and the tradition than I am."
4,This is not really a movie but it's intersting,"This ""NEW"" version of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is more like a television mini-series. It is shot on VIDEO. Not Hi-Def George Lucas like video but soap opera / sitcom style video. However, despite the low budget quality of the production, this is a fun ride. The story and characters differ quite a bit from the theatrical version of the story but I enjoyed this alternate take. It clocks in at over 200 minutes so the story delves deeper into nuances & character arcs. Now on to the martial arts. The fighting in this new production is intense & non-stop. Top notch Kung Fu all the way. Overall, this will not make you forget about the Ang Lee directed theatrical film but it's an interesting alternate version of the epic story. Approach it with an open mind & I think you'll enjoy it."
1,"Great Movie, Bad Video (DVD)","This is a great movie. I don't buy many movies but I enjoyed this movie so much, I had to own it. I bought the DVD. I was anxious to see the English dubbed version to see if it would add or subtract to the enjoyment of the movie. What a disappointment.The sound track was just bad. The relative levels of the music, sound effects and the voices were all wrong. To top if off, the levels varied from scene to scene and would drop off in places. I spent so much time adjusting the volume I could not enjoy the movie. I checked the Mandarin version and it was better.I read some of the other reviews (after I bought it) and some of the suggestions that would have made this DVD perfect. I would have been happy with the current content if they had just gotten it right."
3,"hn, not that impressed","As a huge fan of hong kong/taiwan/chinese films, I've seen countless martial arts movies/tv series. And really, i don't see what's so great about CTHD. Yes, I admit, the cinemtogrphy, art direction, casting, and music were great. It's eye candy if nothing else. But I feel this films lacks a decent plot, and substance. The only part I liked was the 'fantasy' side of the film, where the girl dives off in the end. Other than that it's really not that profound. There are better novels to make films from.Oh, I was also repelled by the flying actions in this film. That's some BS if i've ever seen one! Okay, I'm starting to sound like a snob, but people can't fly! I don't care if you are great masters! Bruce Lee didn't fly didn't he? Lol... ^_^ I would suggest watching the film, as for buying it...that's up to you."
2,Very disappointing!,"I would probably enjoy this movie more if it didn't have all that unrealistic, silly-looking, flying about. C'mon, there is something to be said about general common sense. That fact that this movie got all those awards, only has me question the integrity of how movie awards are selected and praised. I almost bought this stupid movie before I seen it. I'm sure glad I refrained. I wouldn't keep this movie if it were given to me. Too bad, too, because I usually love asian films. I even like Michelle Yeoh. But, this movie, just looked silly. Sorry!"
2,"Vertigo inducing, overrated trash","This movie was terribly overrated. If you want to see people jumping from rooftop to rooftop, rent The Matrix. Explosive indeed, the effects were impressive, and if you're a fantasy devotee, you might be happy, but Crouching Tiger managed to take me to a place where I did not want to visit and where I did not want to stay. I was thankful when all the kicking stopped and I was able to go home."
2,Don't see what all the fuss is about,"I watched this movie on PPV not the DVD. The presentation was digital however. I was really looking forward to this film because of all the good things that I've heard about it. If you haven't seen it, don't buy the DVD. Rent it or see it on cable before you decide.This movie was so obviously unbelievable. It seemed like some of the special effects were just put in gratuitously, they were way off base from the advancing of the plot, what little plot there was."
3,Worth seeing once...,"I thought it was okay the first time around, but even at that, people were making fun of the movie in the theater. The disturbing thing is, I could see how they could make fun of it! The walking on water scene emitted cries of ""Yo, it be Jesus!"" along with a lot of other stupid remarks, because no one was taking the movie vaguely seriously.The subtitles emitted groans from people in the theater the second time around. The flying thing got old after about 15 minutes. My bf was hardly impressed also, and got bored within about 30 minutes and spent the rest of the time making fun of the film..Also, the story line was soooo predictable, and how could no one see the resemblance between Jade Fox and the governess? I have to admit though, the fight scenes were excellent and not typical martial - arts moves."
2,Much too overhyped,"This movie was a major dissapointment, all the so-called special effects had been done in previous kung-fu movies and in some cases done twice as well. The battles are impressive in some cases but if you want to buy a movie for excellent kung-fu fights such as you'd find in this then you should buy Legend 2, it has nearly the same special effect's only done in a much more entertaining fasion then this movie. All i can say is that basically Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon got much to good of a review because of the propaganda that was put out before its release."
3,It was OK,"Heck with the story...Greek tragedy? What are the editors of amazon smoking, anyway? Nonetheless, a very pretty chopsocky flick with flying kung fu out the wazoo, mostly done by women. You can get up and watch your popcorn in the microwave or do your dishes thru the mid-movie romance fugue, too. How considerate of Lee, though he might have done as well with the word ""Intermission""."
3,good story but.....,it had a good plot but as far as the fighting scenes go they are fake and hard to tell if it's northern or suthern chinese Gung Fu. They are wearing northern chinese Gung Fu shoes and the tops i am not sure of but they are speaking the way they do in northern china and i believe they are doing a crossover between northern and suthern chinese Gung Fu.if you are looking for a good chinese Gung Fu movie you won't see it in this movie but if you are looking for a nice love story this is the movie even though i love is kind of shaky in this movie
5,Breathtaking!,"It was absolutely breathtaking! One of the best movies I've ever seen. Being deaf, the subtitles didn't bother me at all, as I'm used to watching with closed captions. The subtitles and the rave reviews I'd seen are what prompted me to go see the movie. I'm a Bruce Lee fan and always loved his fighting choreography. This movie has the same poetry in motion choreography that Bruce Lee's movies had, probably even better. I'm also a very visual person, and the stunts and special effects took my breath away. My 17 year old daughter, who isn't a martial arts fan, loved this movie too and insisted that I buy the DVD when it comes out next week. I agree with some that CTHD is a lot superior than The Gladiator."
2,Disappointed...,"Although I enjoyed Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi (as always), I didn't enjoy this movie hardly at all. I couldn't believe this was the movie that got such rave reviews and was Oscar nominated etc. I don't say that foolishly, stating that I dislike the movie when really I dislike the genre. That's not it. I just much prefer films like ""House of the Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero"" to this one."
3,"Good Story, Bad Ending",I think that the director Ang Lee did a great job depicting China's long and ancient history with the costumes and all the customs. I learned a lot about ancient China's culture and the customs. Of course the martial arts in the movie was exciting to watch as well. However I found it hard to keep up with everything because the actors aren't speaking in English. I think that the story was written very well but the ending was bad and I really didn't get why it was written that way.
3,"Great, except for....","...the desert subplot.It had NO relevance on the rest of the story. You could yank it out entirely and the movie would be much better.As for the rest of the film, wonderful. The acting and action were awesome. This movie is truly a tribute to the old chinese martial arts movies. It's the best example of the genre.This movie would get 5 stars if not for the innane and protracted desert scene."
1,A good laugh,"All the praise the movie is receiving here makes me wonder if people are talking about the same movie. I found the movie extremely boring, and the unrealistic action scenes only made it worse for me. Well, it was actually pretty funny, and me and my wife had some good laughs. I bought the DVD, and regretting it from the bottom of my heart."
5,Incredibly Impressive,"This film deserves all the hype it generated. We are presented with a semi-magical realm where the spirit takes flight and a Samurai master comes to terms with his true feelings of love, but tragically- all too late. The award-winning cinematography is exceptional, and goes far beyond the plasticy computer-generated 'flying-man' sequences that one might see in films such as 'Spider Man' or 'Daredevil'. In Crouching Tiger, when the stars take to the air, the realism is so effective it draws upon the inner inclinations one might feel as they become more enlightened or spiritually powerful to take to the skies. Almost everthing about this film is skillfully executed- from the acting, to the storyline, to the soundtrack- it's a visionary movie that is done with great style and is worth renting."
4,Beware of reviewers praising the martial arts in this movie,"Anyone with a little training and experience will be able to watch the movie and tell that Wang and Fat aren't serious martial artists. Think of Keanu Reaves and Lawrence Fishbourne in The Matrix. So if you see any reviews saying that the martial arts are great but the movie is just okay, you can safely ignore these chumps.Having said that, I think the movie was a lot of fun. I always wondered what would happen if someone threw a lot of money at making one of those Chinese martial arts movies that I loved as a kid. Kind of what Steven Spielberg did to action serials with the Indiana Jones movies.Just don't try to read too much into the movie like a lot of highbrows out there. I overheard a guy walking out of the theater telling his wife that their powers of flight symbolize the boundlessness of their spirits. Please!! No broad sweeping metaphors to decipher in this movie. People have been flying in foreign martial arts movies for decades!"
2,get the standard version,"This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only. Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version. You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place. I've watched this movie on my 40"" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version. So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers."
5,Another Viewer from USA,Viewer from USA is full of himself. Great movie. Great story. Great effects. I guess 'viewer from usa' expects every movie to be solidly based in reality. I feel sorry for him/her. Movies are escapism; nothing illustrates this better than this movie. I hope someday 'viewer' will apprecitate great filmmaking; otherwise stick with documentaries if you want realism.
5,I am and it is,"I grew up with this genre. My fondest memories are Saturdays at the Toyo Theater in Honolulu armed with one dollar. Admission and some snacks later, as an Asian woman, I felt proud and empowered.So, all you Asian ladies out there who are rather ""jaded"" by being mistaken for a Geisha... or Lucy Liu, THIS film will make you feel important.Seriously, it is an extremely well produced, orchestrated masterpiece.It should have swept the Oscars... but that is another essay!Get it, you will not be disappointed unless you lack a chromosome or two."
1,ummm wat wat the hell was this???,"The front of the cover says one of the best movies ever made of all time"" i mean common, this movie was bull, nuthn but people on strings, the fights scenes were ok, but it was so damn boring, damnnn, im not even 12 im 20, and this movie is the ""worst movie of all time"", they shoulda worked more on the action and drama,i suggest u see the matrix if u wanna see sumethn more better, i give it 0 stars"
1,"1,000th review",nevermind i changed my mind... worst movie ever. all of that flying around looked worse than effects from a godzilla movie... or something huh
1,Trashy Action Flick,"It's puzzling that the likes of Hong Kong can afford the advertising outlay to play in American multiplexes and thereby acquire ""star"" status for it's actors like Chow Fat while Japan cannot. Or France or Italy for that matter. Is it because these are really Hollywood financed films taking advantage of corporate liberalization as in Cuba as well?Or is it just Hollywood/China racism?"
3,It's kinda Okay,"Crouching tiger is an okay film with some of China's best known actors and actresses. Except that the fight scenes are all lame (except for the restaurtant figt), there is too much talk, less action, and I think it's so dumb, how people can just fly about on roof tops- it's just so unreal! The plot is complicated, but it's quite good once you understand it."
1,enough is enough,"Look i love a good martial arts film, but come on. PEOPLE CAN NOT FLY LIKE THAT, this isn't kung pow for petes sake, give me a break"
3,"Great story, contrived effects","I think the reason that so many viewers who didn't like the combat scenes in this movie but can't seem to articulate is the fact that the fights in this movie are like ballet. They are like a choreographed dance and had no sense of violence whatsoever. It was more like video game violence than anything, and that's what turned me off most to the movie. This is by no stretch of the imagination a ""Kung Fu flick"" which is how it was marketed and how it was pitched to me by friends who loved it. What it does have going for it, though, is a sweet and compelling love story. It has two love stories, actually, and they're both beautiful and touching for different reasons. If you're looking for a good, rich, compelling story, this movie won't let you down. If you're looking for a kung-fu flick with realistic, visceral-yet-graceful violence, try a Bruce Lee flick. The combat in this movie is nothing more than a dance, which is beautiful in ways, but not what I wanted or enjoy."
1,Zero stars is too many,"I disagree with giving this movie zero stars -- that is too many. I watched the movie from beginning to the end because I didn't want to offend my wife and her family. Forget the old fashioned A and B movies: what comes after F. The sound track is nice though. Okay, a D minus. Does that make for one star? Very overrated. No content. Mindless plot. BAD values. The cinematography could be great if the acting didn't spoil it. I need something to offer my friends and children. This ain't it."
2,Overrated incredulous movie,"Sorry folks. This movie was mediocre. Want a great action movie, try T2 or the original Die Hard. Incredulous fighting (flying?) scenes, depressing ending. Not sure I'd watch this on a Saturday afternoon on channel 5. The martial arts were pretty good though."
1,Fools Gold,"'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is basically nothing more than cinematic fools gold.Why (seemingly) alot of people and critics were so taken with this movie is really beyond me. For crying out loud - get a grip!!Apparently, at the time, the exotic, sensual and flashy quality of the movie really charmed some people.But don't be swindled by all the razzle-dazzle prettiness of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' - this 'fools gold' is really nothing more than a dreary trip that takes you nowhere.Now if that was the 'moral'/message of the movie - well, it succeeded.p.s.if you decide to see 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' - try seeing 'Support Your Local Sheriff' after (for a good laugh) - you'll need it!!"
1,"Trite, old, and politically correct","An oft-repeated and worn-out story with shoddy special effects - that's what's waiting for the crouching tiger in this film. We've seen this many times before but never presented in such a sublimely ridiculous fashion. The female characters are laughable stereotypes, and since they are the only characters of any substance in the film, be prepared for a comedy of major proportions. This movie has been hyped to the heavens. Might political correctness have had anything to do with it?"
3,"Crouching plotline, hidden meaning","If you are going to watch this movie for the first time on DVD, go directly to the director's commentary, watch the entire movie that way first, then watch it...with subtitles...it makes a lot mores sense. Otherwise it's all about some Chinese guy who wants to give up being the fastest sword in the East, but can't seem to give his sword away...it keeps getting stolen by some upstart trained by someone who stole the ginsu-master's training manual and trained the sole pupil by only by using the pictures...then it gets really hazy.Beautiful cinematography though."
2,"Crouchin' Tiger, Hidden Bore....","....I didn't care for it. It seems to be an overblown story about Oriental love and war and honor with actors on strings-like acrobatics. The reason why, in my opinion, most folks dug it is that they have not previously checked out what their kids are watching as far as the Anime or any of the cartoons coming out of the far east...or any of the martial arts stories that have been made for years out of the Orient. Indeed, this is a stylish film, but it is nothing new."
2,No hidden tigers or crouching dragons!,"Asian culture (and people for that matter) seem to be the fad right now. I can't remember a time when Asian food to Asian [people] have been more popular! This film is just another example. Did you know that this isn't even that popular in Taiwan! It does have supurb graphics and is a stunning visual piece but the plot and characterization is awful. Thus, in my opinion it wasn't all that good. Check out other Taiwanese kung-fu movies if like the genre..."
2,Don't buy before seeing,"I had not seen this film in the theater but was considering buying it because of all the acclaim it received. Fortunately, I rented it first. While some of it was entertaining, it is not a movie I would ever care to watch again. Admittedly, I do not know the folklore involved, but a movie should be able to stand on its own. Because this movie does not do that, it's disjoined somewhat and the ending makes no sense. If you enjoy la-la land then you may like this movie . . . I didn't."
2,Asian language / English words *Gimme a Break!*,"The previews looked really cool, not only was it so far fetched, but I spent my whole evening racking my brains trying to keep up w/reading the english words which were being converted from a foreign language. My 5 year old could not stay interested and finally fell asleep because obviously he can't read. I will demand my $ back! This was a waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,fluid,"yes all you martial arts movie geeks it has been done before ive seen ""once upon a time in china pts 1&2"", ""wing chun"", and ""iron monkey"" as well as many many others too. but ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" takes the fighting and action and sword play and raises it up to something new..it brings in a sense of poerty to those scenes..a true zen like quality for example to the scene in the tree tops..where all you here is wind and trees rufflingthis is a beautiful movie...maybe not as dazzling as ""the matrix"" a movie people always bring up in comparison but its like comparing ozzy to beethoven...both are playing music and doing it well..but in completely different styles"
3,A highly Overrated Movie.,"I did not see this movie in the theater and was waiting for the DVD to come out. I picked one up when it was released. But, I might have been expecting a lot from this movie because of all the rave reviews this movie is been getting. I felt that the movie has a very week story and the action scenes looked pretty cheezy to me. I liked the photography and music in the film though. The acting was uniformly good and the new comer Zhang Ziyi stood out. She showed tremondous energy and emotion in acting different scenes in the movie. On the whole this movie left me wanting more. A definite dissapointment!!"
3,"Crouching Tristar, Hidden Columbia","Wow. This is a 5 STAR FILM but a 3 STAR release on DVD. Columbia/Tristar did the usual bad job on this DVD. Not only is it lacking in suppliments (like the music video), But the audio is really BAD!!!! The 5.1 mastering on the Chinese track has lots of audio pops and even drops out at times.You'd figure a film with all the award this won would have been treated better. I guess Columbia/Tristar just doesn't care."
4,Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"The movie is very good if you like action. The way of the fighting in the movie is different from the american style. It has no special affects, instead they use a cable line attatched to the actors to able to exaggerate the moves which is well done. I enjoy watching this movie. Its definatly one of a kind."
3,An OK movie.,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was firt released and I was really expecting to enjoy this movie, but it was not what I expected.What I didn't like was that I had no idea what was going on when these people just started flying around and were able to climb buildings like spiders. Don't get me wrong, I love science-fiction and fantasy movies, but this was just wierd and that's what ruined it for me.This movie wasn't all bad it did have an OK story line, but it didn't make it one of my favorite stories of all time.Be sure to rent this movie before you decide to buy it. You may like it, you may not."
1,I Don't Get It.,"What's all the hype about here? this movie is really nothing special. i found it dumb and pointless, much to the suprise of my friends, who loved it. i just dont get it."
1,Say What??,"I dont know, maybe its just me...But I have a hard problem watching a movie when I dont understand one word they say. The action sequences are good, but other then that...either I should invest on learning some more Oriental Languages or they should get a quality English dubber."
2,CROUCHING TIGER UN-HIDDEN SUBTITLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was expecting so much out of this movie because of all the hype following it. I am an avid reader and do not normally mind subtitled movies (ie.. Pan's Labyrinth and Kung-Fu Hustle.. BTW, Kung-Fu Hustle is LOTS OF FUN!) but there were PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH, NOT SENTENCES, OF DIALOG.. FAR TOO MANY SUBTITLES GOING ON AND ON FOREVER, AND GOING BY QUICKLY, that I could not figure out who was who or what was what in this movie. I lost the plot in the first half hour. I was so busy trying to read that my contacts kept drying out and I could not enjoy anything else going on in the film. If you're a martial arts purist, maybe you would enjoy it more than myself. Also, maybe I could have enjoyed it more dubbed in English."
3,I have the one with subtitles,I bought the one that has the words wrote out. I didn't know there was one that was audio. I wish that I would of bought thtat one. I would like to know where to find one that you don't have to read along with the movie. Any one know where to buy that one. Other than that I thought the movie was great
2,"Slouching Tiger, Snoozing Dragon","The two stars I gave this film was for the beautiful scenery portrayed in the movie. That was all I liked about this movie. The story did not carry well, the teenage girl really began to annoy me almost immediately with her perpetual psycho trip. The special effects were pretty cool the first time you saw them but for the rest of the movie the ""flying around"" got quite old.My idea of what makes a good movie are examples such as ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator""; this movie however was a sleeper. Buy this movie if you're looking for a cure for insomnia."
3,Good production - average story,"Just to be the devil's advocate, obviously this is a good movie but.... If you have watched a good share of movies from Hong Kong and over sees this story is pretty standard. The only difference between this movie and half of the good movies from Hong Kong is the cinematography and production size(ie money). Also the English translation is quite a bit off from the actual meaning in several scenes, but in all fairness it was too difficult to translate everything exactly. The movie is definitely over hyped, it is just that the American market is not used to movies like this and trust me after this movie makes 10times more money that any other hong kong release before it you will see all the other movies like it they decided wouldn't do well in the States get released in the next few months."
3,What happened to english dub?,"I just shelled out the big bucks to enjoy crouching tiger on my new 55"" rear project, progressive scan setup and low and behold the premier version of this dvd is only in mandarin chinese. In my neck of the woods we pretty much just speak english so save the money unless you like reading subtitles..."
1,A STUPID MOVIE!- DON'T WAST THE MONEY!,"At first when I heard about this movie, I thought It would be good, as some foriegn films can be. But like somebody else said, PEOPLE CAN NOT FLY LIKE THAT! It looked like they where fighting on the moon because they where just casually running up 30 foot vertical walls over and over and over and over! When they got hit, they whould go back floating 2 feet of the ground! The movie is also very slow going, and it is almost impossible to follow. PLEASE DON'T WAST YOUR$! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!P.S. If they would have had a 0.00000001 star selection, I would have picked that! Again, as that other guy said, PEOPLE CAN NOT FLY LIKE THAT! This movie doesn't take pysics masters to know that the stuff on the movie is plainly impossible! Now if they where fighting in space, well then..."
2,Send this one back to China,"I do not understand all the praise this movie has received. The story makes no sense! It's a dreamy, artsy movie, part fantasy part reality. The choreography is great, as is the music and costumes. BUT I started checking my watch after the first 30 minutes, waiting for it to end. It's frustrating trying to take in all the images on screen WHILE reading subtitles WHILE trying to figure out what is going on WHILE avoiding the young princess's yellow teeth!I am reminded of an episode of I Love Lucy where Lucy says, ""This looks like a bad dream you'd have after eating too much chinese food""."
1,IT'S BORING!!,"WHAT THE!?...This is not a kung fu movie, It's just a love movie with 3 or 4 fights and too much flying...BORING!!!If you want to see some old school kung fu movies that has a lot of crazy punches and kicks and sword play with out the hollywood hype, check out:Dragon InnDuel to the DeathFists and GutsThe Shaolin Drunken MonkMystery of Chess BoxingFive Deadly VenomsReturn of the 5 Deadly Venoms"
1,stupid and boring,I saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull. True story.
3,Better on the big screen,"This movie is so lavishly beautiful whenever I see it on the big screen, but it doesn't quite dazzle me so much in this format.Once it gets to your living room, a lot of the magic has vanished, and it becomes more of a dust collector on your shelf than a source of entertainment.Except for one part! That amazing night-time fight scene at the beginning of the film, with its breathtaking soundtrack and balletic precision."
4,Corny but ethereal,"I find it somewhat difficult to even rate this movie. Somehow it's corny, but ethereal at the same time. The story and scenes are the ethereal part, whereas I cannot help but find the running up walls, flying through the air and fighting on slender bamboo stalks corny. I've heard, though, that the latter is the sign of a good Asian martial arts movie."
3,"good, not great!","while i enjoyed the cinematography, the locations and the acting of chow-yun fat, i do not agree with the overall opinion of people who write that this is one of the greatest movies released last year(2000) or ever. the story isn't groundbreaking and fairly predictable. that said, it was a movie that differed in the fact that it wasn't made by hollywood, so i assume this is what made people think more of it than they would otherwise."
2,"Crouching Tiger, Missing Scenes!!","I bought Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon on DVD, and watched it last night. I was disappointed with the release. It is dubbed in English, which makes it easier to watch, because you aren't always reading subtitles. However, they deleted at least 15 minutes from the film, and didn't include them on the disk as extra or deleted scenes. One of the deleted scenes was one of the best fight scenes of the whole movie, I don't understand why they did it. The theatrical version was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, with story twists, and fights, that really enriched the movie. I loved it in the theater, and couldn't wait to own it on DVD. I don't know why they'd edit these great scenes out, other than to make more money with a 'director's cut' release in the future."
3,Left Me With A Certain Feeling,"As an ardent fan of the cinema, I often find myself overflowing with emotion upon leaving the theater. Movies have the ability to make me extremely happy or sad as the case may be. This movie somehow made me very hungry. I left the theater with a strong craving for kung pao chicken. I don't mean this in a racist way, as the ethnicity of the cast may or may not have had anything to do with my culinary craving. Unfortunately the restaurant I went to was not very good so I cannot give this movie more than three stars. Here is me trying to speak Hawaiian: Huki luki wakaha lau. I don't know if I actually said anything or not, but there is a good chance since there are only 13 letters in the Hawaiian alphabet. I know this because I'm smart."
3,Merely Average,"I'm one of a minority breed that neither loved nor hated this film. It has some good points like some great acting and a vaguely intriguing if somewhat drawn out storyline and it also had some bad points, notably some of the special effects which were nothing sort of pathetic (the flying scenes etc.) Its one of those films that you have to make your own judgement on but personally its not something that I'd watch again so rent before you buy!"
1,"Bad, Boring, and Dumb!!","I can't believe how mindless most people are nowadays, this movie is just Bad, Boring and Dumb!!"
1,What the deal?,"Being a hug fan of martial arts and similar action movies, I thought Crouching Tiger would be another film added to my library. Forget it. I couldn't even watch the whole thing through without nearly falling asleep. The sequences are ok but the flying is just ridiculous. The story is so thin - the search for an ancient sword. The subtitles distract from watching the footage. How in the world did this one get these Acadmey Awards??"
1,Not as good as you think,"I don't think it is such a good film to win Academic Award. It is not popular in China although it is a Chinese film. I don't like it, so does many Chinese. Maybe this film is too common in China. In contract, I like 'The Matrix', 'Five elements'. I have seen too many Chinese kungfu film by Yun-Fat Chow. Now I don't like them any more."
1,Overblown hype,"I've watched the movie and while the fight scenes, the scenery, and the characterizations are truly wonderful, the main part of the film (the plot) leaves one in the dust with disappointment.When the movie is done, you are left with the impression that one young brat is responsible for the pain, suffering, and death of countless good people. Even the ending - when she supposedly finds her happiness - leaves her lover in the lurch ... after he sacrificed everything he had for her.It was a very disappointing film given the incredible amount of hype around it at the time of the theatrical release and the release of the DVD."
2,...,"Don't believe the hype. The matrixesque martial arts fall flat especially when the characters fly across the screen. This reminds me of a play I saw in grade school, ""Peter Pan"". The story itself is nothing new. The acting is average. I do think cHOW yUN fAT is superb actor but he alone is not enough to carry this film. If this is the best of the kung fu genre than I don't think I need to watch a kung fu film ever again. As for the rave reviews, the oscar nominees, the best foreign film award, critics top ten, etc. Ang Lee is lucky. Maybe ""Sense and Sensibility"" hit a soft spot WITH the critics,but not with me. tHIS MOVIE IS the most over rated film of the last decade."
3,Nothing special,"I watched this movie with a nagging feeling of disappointment. This isn't the best movie in the kung-fu genre, nowhere near the best movie of 2000 and I strongly doubt that it's even the best foreign movie of 2000. It makes you wonder whether or not this film would have gotten the notoriety it received had it not the special effects budget and the established Chinese-Hollywood actors at it's helm.That said, visually this film is quite stunning, but cinematography can't completely glaze over a thin, meandering plot and flimsy script. You have to also wonder how many reviewers who gave this 5 stars skip past the reams of dialogue and straight to the spectacular fight sequences. Hmm..."
3,Buyer Beware,"Fantastic movie, great picture and sound, but beware, this movie is in Mandarin Chinese, with English subtitles! I am referring to the Superbit Collection version. Spoken english is not an option on this DVD. Best wire work I have ever seen, great acting from some of the best available in the world, awesome scenery, but be prepared to put up with looking up and down at the subtitles. I was not. Still I gave it 3 stars."
2,boring,"This movie was completely unbelievable. People running up walls, flying through the air while they were fighting. I liked a few of the stars but it was just a huge disappointment for me. If I had not heard anything about the movie I might have given it an extra star but my expectations were high so it added to my disappointment. I expected a great flick but I got a high budget B-flick. Do not buy this. Wait for it to come on T.V. and then only watch it if you have nothing else better to do."
2,"Missed potential - riddled with PC, stupid ending","This could have been a truly great movie were it not westernized with a lot of political correct roles and dialogue. These days, I guess that is what it takes for creative work to be considered for an Academy Award...Special fighting effects are cool, but used way, way too much. Ending was a total cop-out.On the good side, did provide somewhat of a window into the Chinese culture and internal struggle of class and gender. Female lead was awesome. Inventive, romantic story line (crashed near the end). Definitely watch English subtitle version. I was amazed at how quickly we forgot we were listening to Chinese."
2,Why? Why? Why all the awards?,"I like an art movie as much as the next person, but this was really tedious! It is beautifully shot and the art direction is wonderful- this does not make up for a boring story and endless tedious martial arts. A great disappointment considering all the fuss that was made about this movie. I appreciate the choreography of the action scenes but enough is enough-the flying sequences were not properly realised-you could not see the wires but you knew they were there! Viewing this film was a triumph of hope over experience. I should have known that this was just another kung fu film-however you dress it up! Sorry Ang close but no cigar!"
3,Can you say Wire-Fu?,"What I mean by Wire-Fu is the people in the movie flying around on wires while fighting, and I think that is a really bad aspect of the movie. If it didn't have any Wire-Fu and just pure Kung-Fu and Swordplay action this would have gotten 5 stars. Nevertheless, it could have been a great movie."
2,"Ok, but not the spectacular event people claim it is","Yes, it is a high-quality version of Hong Kong wuxia films. Some of the action scenes are great, some are too unrealistic.The ""flying people"" is at times, a bit bizarre. The best way to view it is on DVD, since it has English Dolby 5.1. The lead actors are good, but no need to rush out to get this non-epic."
3,Overhyped,"I'm assigning a three-star rating to a four-star movie, simply because of five-star overexposure.This is perhaps the greatest martial-arts movie ever made. It has an intriguing plot, wonderful acting, outstanding cinematography, and impeccable direction.And, at the end of the day, it's still a popcorn martial-arts flick. It's a little like writing and directing the best porn flick ever; you might have accomplished something remarkable, but it's still a porn flick. The fashion in which this movie was overconstructed through the cinema awards ceremonies led to a real letdown for me. Yes, it was good fun. Yes, it had its moments. No, it wasn't even close to being in the same league as films like _Gladiator_. Not even the same universe.Check your expectations at the door. Forget you ever got oversaturated with the name 'Ang Lee' at the Oscars, and you'll have a delightful time."
2,"Chop-sockey film, rent before you buy","I was surprised at this film which I saw on a rented video. The hand-to-hand fight scenes are phony looking; the aerial gymnastics are obviously done with wires (not anywhere near The Matrix in quality). Although, I really did like the sword fights, the choreography on them seemed excellent. Perhaps it's just a culture clash that made the characters motivations and actions seem childish if not plain stupid to me. If you saw it in the theater and liked it, fine then get it, but I would recommend renting it first and then if you like it, buy it from Amazon."
2,Hate to go against type,"I hate to go against everyone, but I did not think that this movie was anywhere near 5 stars. The actors were great. It was a pretty movie and the fight scenes were well done, but the ending was so weak it ruined it all for me. When I saw it at the theater, after the end, folks stayed in their seats as if shocked and I heard someone say,""Did the film break?"" I checked out the DVD to be sure that I actually saw the end of the movie and I did. I did not like it. The DVD is top quality; however, there was no alternative ending provided. This is a fault, at least for me."
2,"Good choreography, and that's about it....","Good action sequences, horrible movie. Do not buy into the critics, and do not buy this movie !!!!Rent it, and then laugh."
2,What Is This???,"Ok, I know that this movie won best director, and that it was up for best picture, but I DO NOT see what everyone saw in this movie! Maybe it was that the subtitles distracted me from the action, maybe I just am not a candidate for artsy films, but I know that hated this movie!!! It was such nonsense, I lost interest halfway through. I still watched it, but it made no sense! Where did these people learn to fly??? Say what you will, but I hated this movie. Go see it if you want, but if you have read my other reviews and you agree with them, trust me, stay away from this movie."
5,This movie is a MUST BUY!,"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER, DEFINITELY ON MY TOP 5 LIST!Theonly flaw in the movie was the flying, they should of made it morerealistic, other than that its PERFECT!"
4,"Interesting story, great special effects.","Interesting story, well directed and acted, good special effects. Not your usual Kung Fu movie, but one with depth and suspensfull."
1,mysticism and bad values,Would give this a 0 star rating. This is a truly horrible movie. Full of mysticism and bad decisions with a totally nonsensical ending. The only reason I continued to watch was because it was recommended to me by family. I managed to watch the whole thing due to my incredulity and fascination for just how bad it would get. By the end I was standing and trying not to gag.
1,"Boring Tiger, Stupid Dragon","One of the stupidest movies of the year. Trust wait for video on this one. I spent more time reading the stupid subtitles than watching the movie. The guy next could never shut the heck up! There is no really ""Matrix"" type fighting in this movie. However this movie is too violent for children under 9. Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors but, he made this movie to boring. This film stars Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King, The Corrupter).Directed by: Ang Lee (The Ice Storm, Ride with the Devil) 140 min."
1,"Crouching Nonsense, Hidden Talent","I am all for globalization, but this movie is a meandering mess of special effects, asian pseudophilosophy, and a dopey love story. If you want a movie with Chinese mystical superheroes and a lot of action, watch ""Big Time In Little China,"", which needs no dubbing, no pretentious seriousness, and has an actual plot."
4,Awesome foreign Flick,"If you like romance, cool kung-fu action, and like the old style kung-fu type flick, I would recommend this movie. Some action sequences seem cartoon like, but overall a dvd to definitly add to your collection. Nice love story. Chow Yun Fat is cool and plays his character's row very good."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR A KUNGFU COLLECTION!!,"GREAT MOVIE. A MUST HAVE FOR ALL KUNGFU MOVIE COLLECTORS. IF YOU WATCHED IT IN THE THEATER,IT'S EVEN BETTER IN ENGLISH AT HOME ON 5.1 DOLBY DIGITAL. NO NEED TO MESS WITH SUBTITLES."
3,PETER TAI-PAN,"Having seen the spoof KUNG POW only a few days before this critically acclaimed film, I found myself waiting for one of the females to let out one of Ling's ""Weeeeeee""s. Obviously CROUCHING TIGER is not a spoof, but a beautifully orchestrated film, lovingly directed by Ang Lee. Winner of four Oscars, including Best Foreign Film, the movie is an epic tale, reminiscent of greek tragedies and sweeping romantic movies. The fight scenes are unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking. Unfortunately, I found the movie rather dull and repetitious, and its poetic fantasia wasn't my cup of tea. Can't deny its cinematic brilliance; it just isn't as great to me as to others, but hey, weeeeee....."
5,6 enthusiastic stars- girl power,"This is my favorite DVD. Who said women cant fight. Who said women arent tought. I love the women in this film because they fight with style. And yet, if we put the martial arts aside, I love this movie because of its visual artistry. Each time I watch this film on DVD, I am mesmerized by the flying sequences, the sword fight dances and ofcourse the beautiful costumes. I watch it in the original chinese with subtitles and in english and both are good. The english is very funny while the chinese seems to be more clear and literal."
5,"Beautiful, breathtaking, stunning...","Do yourself a favor, and watch the version WITH the subtitles. It is silly otherwise."
2,Crouching Tiger.......,"----------------------------------------------------------------Despite the (over)hype, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very simply, very easily overrated. Although it has moments that are truly great, these are few and far between. This is hardly the best Martial Arts movie of all time, that's for sure. And I don't know why people are praising the FX. Digitally erasing wires is NOT a great achievement. Director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm) has come up with the least interesting film of his career, though Crouching Tiger IS more entertaining than Ride With The Devil. Based on the (over)reaction to Crouching Tiger, I expected magic. Instead, I got a tedious and pretentious film that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of brilliance. According to my watch, with which I become well acquainted during the screening, I believe that there are about 20 minutes of a great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one.----------------------------------------------------------------"
2,Sorely lousy,"I dun understand why it is a hit in western countries? The only reason I can think of is that they never seen a better sword fighting kung fu movie. The fighting moves are nice undoubtly, but it is a bit ridiculous. Sword fighting is not all about ""floating around in the sky"". it actually also follows the physics law. clearly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fails to see this point. however, the casts gave quite a good performance. if u want to see a good swording stunts and moves, this movie is not the one."
1,Worst movie ever made next to plan 9 from outer space!,"What were the makers of this film smoking when they made this, this is just another kung-fu style fighting movie , nothing is different from this film and the ones I watched 10 years ago,except this has a dumb story. The only thing is the people can fly higher. Who can't make a movie like this. Make people fly and fight each other and lets say they have to find some jewls, there you got yourself another award winner. How can anyone like this. If I wanted to watch people fly i'd watch Peter Pan!"
1,soooo boring and stupid script,"I tried to like this movie. I really did, but whole time spent in the theatre was total agony. It bored me to death. Even the fighting scenes were much too long to be enjoyable. The story was so thin, that film director probably had to fill the time somehow. Besides that the whole plot is absurd. You can never figure out why characters are doing what they are doing. Who hates who and why. They are just confused. Bad, bad movie."
4,Loved it,"Great movie. Good to watch in the original score or the dubbed English. Though they change some of the words between the two, it's still not your hokey dubbing tha tyou're proably used to from older movies. They did a real good job and seemed to avoid that mouth-moving-but-he's-already-done-talking problem. I liked it! The musical score was good too, I shall have to find the soundtrack somewhere..."
1,magic ?,"The only magic here was how Lee got you to part with your money to view this epically terrible, boring B- movie... saying this was important film making would embarrass even Jackie Chan..."
1,A Waste of Time,"I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. BORING! The story was somewhat hard to follow and so slow I almost fell asleep! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to waste your money & time. Boy did Hollywood get this one wrong!"
1,Crouching Stinkbomb Hidden Movie,"Joel Siegel called this move ""One of the Greatest Films Ever Made"". This may be the most foolish statement ever made !!Crouching Tiger was plain silly. I'm not sure what all the hoopla was about, and I guess in today's society, it's normal for a film to get some cult support and soon after, a huge bandwagon follows (i.e. Blair Witch, which was also horrible).I have purchased many dvd's over the past year, and this is the first one I have truly regretted buying.A silly movie, in which people can just fly at will. I say fly away, PLEASE !!"
1,I can't believe it went to Oscar,"Unlike other HK movie, the script of Crouching Tiger was so poorly written there is almost no story in it. It was like watching the black and white HK kungfu movies of the 40's and 50's. Take away the cable jumping shots, you can finish the movie in properly 30 min. In other words, the movie is 90 min too long. I just can't understand how the taste of the critics could get so bad."
3,Sword,"This movie was focused around a sword that is stolen, retrieved and stolen again. Plenty of unbelievable moves from the Actors and I mean ""give me a break"". You watch the fighting scenes and as a Martial artist, you know these things can never happen. Good entertainment."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I am sorry, but I was totally disappointed with this film. I expected so much more after the academy award winnings and the great reviews. It might be spectacular for film people, how it's done, etc. but for me, well, it simply was a bit boring, nothing much happened, and the story didn't grab me at all. I much rather see a film like Matrix or Titanic, now there is a story behind to puzzle your mind. And it didn't even have a happy end either, no end at all, really....another DVD that won't be watched again..."
2,Very good cinematography...,"That is all I can say about this film. And the fighting is also somewhat breathtaking, but not as exciting as in The Matrix because the story is not very appealling, did not caught my eye, at all. The weaknesses in this film are the story, the story and the script. It was a nice package but inside there was not much to see."
1,"Great film, OK extras, horrid menu","Much as I love the film, a review of this *DVD* has to punish it severely. The quality is OK, the extras are there (the entire film commentary by the director and producer/writer is interesting), but the menus are appalling and wreck the whole DVD experience.Every transition is accompanied by two short clips, making navigation a real chore. This by itself is bad, but the subtitles menu actually spoilers the *final scene*, thereby ruining any impact it might have had (should you have missed this film at the cinema). For me, that is a shocking gaffe, and deserves to be thoroughly slated.OK, if you want to see this film on DVD, you have to get *this* DVD. The film is worth it, but I don't have to like the way it's presented."
2,Crouching Under the Sofa,"Briefly - If you enjoy fantasy/action movies with lots of cartoonish fighting, you'll love ""Crouching Tiger"". I don't, so I didn't. At some point I was misled into thinking this movie would appeal to me. Can't remember why, other than the fact that it features Chow Yun Fat. But this film in no way resembles ""Anna & the King"" (huge understatement). The cinematography is quite good, but that's not enough to sustain my attention for two hours.Sometimes I fear that when this Boomer is too old and frail to be anywhere but in a nursing home, I'll be stuck in the dayroom watching movies such as this, as I'll be too confused and feeble to protest. At least with the non-English dialogue, however, it will be easier to ignore. In fact, I'm ignoring it right now as I type this. I found myself hoping that Idina Menzel would suddenly appear singing ""Defying Gravity"", but despairing of that likelihood, I've given up on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""."
4,good and classy,"ive seen this movie three times.the 1st time it was spoken in chinese with no words at the bottom.the 2nd was the same deal but with the english translation at the bottom.the 3rd was in normal english.thank god!in it,a thief steals a relic and some people go to get it back.it has breathtaking backgrounds like lord of the rings.beatiful music like amadeus and martial arts effects like a pre-matrix but similar.the kids could watch it.theres only one bad part.it is definately a artsy and classy type film.ang lee is the director.he also did the hulk.the hulk is better.it is not emotional per say but more inspirational.there are some chicks but they are not portrayed in a sexual way.one guy,in the less than apropriate part gets his hand down ones pants.i dont care what anyone says,if you get this in english,it is one of the best movies youll ever see.the special effects are cool.the fighting is outstanding!"
3,"Typical on the genre, disappointing end","This movie has a very Eastern flavor to it. The ending is very grating and unsatisfactory to many (including me) western minds. Having said that, I should point out that if you like this type of film, it would probably receive 5 stars."
2,!!! Now I understand Riddly Scott !!!,"As someone who is obsessed with Gladiator I was shocked to see four Oscars go to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And now after I saw the movie, I understand why Riddly Scott was shocked too in the Oscars!!! Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not a bad movie but is not worth all that!Here are the ups and downs in the movie:1. The story progress is extremely slow and boring.2. The plot is not all that.3. Great sound track.4. Great scenery.5. Good acting job and marshal art demonstration.6. Touchy ending!7. The thing that doesn't make sense at all was the zero gravity in the movie! Wow, everybody could fly&#65533; where was this film taken? On the moon?!!!!!!!Rent this movie to satisfy your curiosity but do not buy it! I guess politics had its own role again in the Oscars!!!Something else, this DVD's English subtitle doesn't match at all the English Dialogue in the movie!!!"
2,"Crouching Camera, Hidden Wires","I don't get it. Action sequences so unrealistic that I could not suspend my disbelief. Neither boy gets either girl. Heavy-handed yet obscure symbolism.I feel like this is a movie we (the public) were programmed to like. The media blitz convinced us that it was somehow ""heavy"" and ""spiritual"" - something that our western minds should try to embrace. I felt a definite ""Emperor's New Clothes"" syndrome - I know my opinion is not a popular one, but again, I just don't get it.I'll admit I found it mildly entertaining, and I must assume that many action sequences were incredibly difficult to film. But just because something is hard to do doesn't make it good. To me it's nothing but another surrealistic martial arts movie, albeit one with good photography and better acting than usual. But the greatest movie ever made? Sorry, but the Emperor's wire is showing when he flies (to mangle a metaphor)."
2,"crouching tiger, hidden dragon","not a good movie, no plot at all. it's funny that critic's always blast action movies for having no plot, but when an ""art house"" action flick comes out there is not a word about the BIG holes in the plot."
4,Flawed but amazing.,"First the bad. the film was slightly overrated. but i did love the movie. THe bad parts are this: it dragged at the end and often in between the fights. also the film being in Mandarin hindered Chow Yun Fats ability to exude his charisma somewhat it thought. hes much cooler in cantonese films. That said it had a great director. Ang Lee, not sondberg was the years best director. he has a true eye for detail that saves the film. and lets not forget perhaps the greatest fight scenes ever put to film. amazing to see. overall the movie aint perfect but is pretty cool and entertaining."
5,One of the all time great films,"I approached Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with great trepidation; after all it was a martial arts film, right? It turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. The cinematography, the cast, the plot, the dialogue, the fight scenes, and the acting were first class. Normally I do not enjoy movies with subtitles, but in this case the subtitles seem to add to the mystic of the film. There has been much debate about the floating effect of the fight scenes, and for the first few seconds when I saw it I was first taken aback. Then as the film progressed, this special effect just added to the mystic of the film, and it seemed to fit naturally as any other special effect. Pay-per-view ran a dubbed version of the film and I watched it for about half and hour before giving up. Believe it or not, the version with the subtitles is better. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a truly remarkable film."
4,Solid,"A solid film, but if falls short of being amazing. Ang Lee has done a magnificent job with the cast and a limited budget. A little too much flying around wrecks the importance of this film, which is to tell an epic story of love and destiny. When I saw this in the theaters, I heard giggling and laughing during the ridiculous flying scenes."
5,Excellent.,"This was not just good escapism, but strong philosophy as it revealed the requirements and sacrifices of warriors. Even now, as I think about the movie, I see the majesty and beauty of exotic places and cultures."
2,Serious Issues with Superbit Collection,"Overall a fantastic movie. However, buyers should be aware that the Superbit Collection may add audio clarity at the expense of the extra features typical to DVDs. For instance the the regular DVD edition contains interviews, commentaries, graphics, etc. Superbit has none of these. For the vast majority of buyers who will not be able to even notice the difference in sound quality, this is a more expensive product that adds little value. Stick with the regular DVD edition (which I'd rate a 5)."
3,Over rated for its category,"Having grown up in Asia, I have been exposed to this sort of movies at a young age. Therefore, when this movie came on the big screen, I went to see it hoping that it would be of the same calibre as those i was accustomed to. Unfortunately, apart from its big name director and Asian A-List actors, this movie was just mediocre in its genre. However, the special effects are still quite enjoyable on the big screen, but once transfered to DVD, unless you own a screen large enough to see all the flying and martial arts scenes as it was meant to be seen, the whole aspect of the movie is lost.Perhaps as a movie targeted at Western audiences, it serves its purpose to be rated such high acclaim. But when classified and rated with similar types of movies, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, to me only crouched and hid and did not live up to the potential it could have become."
4,Essentially a Martial Arts Star Wars,"Everybody who sees this movie will find something to enjoy. Period. It is really diverse and entertaining. I find it odd that no critic seems to have noticed the Star Wars parallels (Or maybe it is more appropriate to say that this movie continues the tradition that inspired Star Wars) which include 3 distinct climatic regions, several cantinas filled with a variety of exotic people, and a mystical warrior with special powers. But apart from the stunning visuals this movie offers an increadible philosophical position. Much like the recently released novel ""Glorious Failure"" by Ben Jonjak, ""Crouching Tiger"" espouses a theory of self-actualization that sounds so perfect that it must be true. I highly recommend that you obtain each of these works."
4,Very well done movie..,"I don't think there's another Chinese movie that weaves fanatasy, drama and romance so perfectly into one simple plot. Though not the best fantasy martial arts movie ever (Swordsmans 2 holds that honor), CTHD is still a remarkably well done movie. The acting is top notch. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are on top of their game. And newcomer Zhang Ziyi electrifies the screen with her intensity."
1,doesn't work with windows 2000 dvd player,"I was all excited to watch the dvd of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but discovered to my shock that the autoplay feature of the dvd somehow blocks the dvd drive in my pc from playing the movie. only the web link works. So be warned, there is a serious problem with this disc and windows me edition."
2,Overrated...maybe deserves 2 1/2 stars.,"This film is an effective departure from the usual martial arts stuff. Could that be why it's so popular. Masterpiece, no. Good movie, yes."
2,Overrated,"That's all there is to it. This movie wasn't as good as everyone had hyped it to be. If you like the whole ""Chinese art"" then just go out and rent the Ninja Scrolls. Granted, it's Japanese Anime, but the plots are the same, and the special effects are better in the cartoon than in the live-action. I can't say anything nice about this movie. Overrated."
2,Why love this movie?,"I can understand the recent fascination with Ang Lee's masterpiece about the quiet warriors and thieves, but can't say that I liked it at all. Given that there were a lot of amazing action sequences and the story was more than that of your regular run of the mill action movie it stands well in some places. It's the middle that sends me to sleep everytime I watch it. The love story is carried out to long and caused me to go, ""Yeah I get your point...she likes him and he likes her but she's a princess and he's a renegade."" I've seen it a million times and it still plays the same as it did with Shakespeare...this one doesn't even have a twist. That is why I feel that the film doesn't hold its own and is in fact very unoriginal and boring. A vailiant effort by Ang Lee but not good enough."
2,Despicable DVD producers,"I rate the movie 5 stars, the product 2 stars. Despicable DVD producers slap a 5 second loop of the incredible, heart-breaking climax of the film on the intro menu screen. It's like showing pictures of the Grand Canyon to someone before they are just about to see it. WTF is wrong with people?? Whoever did that is either a SADIST or a genuine MORON. They don't give a sht about the art, much have any respect the viewer."
2,[...]with special effects,"After being grossly disappointed by movie, I have talked to several Chinese people - they wanted nothing more but to completely distance themselves from it. They said, ""it is like Chinese food in USA - adapted to western taste, no real flavor left"""
2,"Sorry, I don't get it","The plot was confusing, and once I did understand who everybody was (more or less), I didn't really care. Who was the old man? Was he some kind of teacher? Why was he keeping the sword? How did that little girl get trained anyway? She was a governor's daughter and was unsupervised her whole life? What was this temple they kept talking about? What was all the hoo-ha in the beginning about the warrior's meditation anyway, what did it have to do with anything? It was like this was the fourth of a series and you were already supposed to know all the background.Some of the fight scenes were pretty, especially the bamboo tree scene, but it was laughable to me generally. People flying? Based on what? The Matrix had an excuse, a background, that permitted one to believe that it was possible for the characters to defy gravity and so forth. Here they just start flying around without any information aside from some vague reference to a manual.Can you spell ``exposition'' in Chinese?"
2,Weak,"Thank goodness for the breath-taking action sequences, cause this film plays like a bad martial arts B film from the 60's otherwise. The acting is plastic throughout and the (ahem!) ""plot"" if you want to call it that, is so far-fetched and unexplainable...I can't explain it! I tried this film in English and then, in Chinese with English subtitles but- still - it misses, badly. Either I'm just not able to connect in a cross-cultural way to a story that has deep meaning or the critics are crazy! I kept on waiting for Woody Allen or one of the Python boys to walk in and halt the proceedings with a laugh and pratfall. The English dubbing actors voices and performances are dreadful. I swear they sound like two actors from ""Godzilla"" or ""Rodan."" The ""love story"" between the two ""heroes"" is flimsy and acted with inexcusable wooden gestures and melodramatic delivery. In fact, every ""character"" in this film is just that - a character. I know this puts me in the minority but - geez - what a stinker!"
2,BOOORRING,"The best thing that can be said about this film is that it has beautiful color and cinematography. The flight scenes with the characters flitting around like Superman or Superwoman just left me absolutely cold. Maybe if they weren't running up vertical walls and on the ceiling or across the landscape with their feet moving it would have been a little more believable. I mean why move your feet when they aren't contacting anything half the time. Why not just wing it like Superman did. His flight scenes were much more realistic than this amateurish attempt. The plot is feeble at best involving the theft of a 400 yr. old sword that looks like something Captain Hook might have been carrying.Sorry, but in my opinion this film is HIGHLY over-rated."
2,Mediocre,...totally unbelievable ...with wonderful cinematography. But ...nonetheless. The film loses all credibility when characters start flying around rooftops in fake-looking combat scenes. Please!
2,"Box office hits are usually mediocre films, like this one.","It is a fact that when a lot of people like one movie it is because A) It is a great movie, B) It was made to please the average viewer, hence it is mediocre. Ok, this film lacked the most important thing of all: a strong plot. Most people are morons, so it is ok if you liked this movie. Intelligent people with sensitivity do not like this film."
4,Thank God for the English dub......,"I liked CTHD in the theatre a lot and I appreciate the fact that this film stayed in its origionlal language with english subtitles. But I am also glad that the DVD will have an english dialogue track as an option. As with most subtitled films you miss some of the on screen detail while reading the text. Crouching Tiger is a beautiful film and I will watch the english version at home only to see more of the epic picture its self. I am not against subtitled films, but I am glad to have the option included to keep my eyes fixed on the action and not the text at the bottom of the screen."
3,The editor stayed home,"... Or rather, the excutive directors made a hash of it.I recall when watching ""Henry V"" in a theatre that the projectionist ""fell asleep"" and failed to setup the reels causing the the movie to come to halt right in the middle of the battle of Agincourt. CTHD has transitions just as bad, the worse being after the romantic scene where ShuLien and MuBai are re-connecting; there just isn't enough ""linger"".The bamboo forest scene also seems rather hurried through, in contrast to Kurosawas reed survival scene in ""Dersu Uzala""; you never get to feel the bamboo.As far as marial arts and chinese culture, this film might be crisp, but is no less entertaining than, let's say, ""Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin"", a vintage Jackie Chan (acted, not directed) movie."
2,"don't buy this version, you'll feel jipped!","I bought this version thinking that it was going to be an improvement on the original DVD version...I was wrong. I have what I would consider a pretty sooped-up home theater and I could tell no difference in picture quality between this and the regular version DVD. Furthermore, the only audio track you get is the Mandarin version. If you want to understand what is going on and you don't understand Mandarin, you're forced to turn on the subtitles...I HATE SUBTITLES!!!While I see what ""Superbit"" is trying to accomplish, I don't think there are many folks who will be able to tell a difference. Buy the regular DVD. You'll thank me later."
2,chic flick with special effects,"This was a watered down adventure story of fulfillment (snore). Some of the special effects were interesting but evolved into the absurd. Overall, it is probably worth watching once provided somebody else rents or owns it."
2,Croutching Tiger Hidden...Swordfight?,This Movie... an alright movie was kind of disappointing. When I saw the preveiws It looked like most of the fights would be great. Yet There werent that many. One problem I had was I read the whole movie. Now and then I would forget about the picture and be readingin an important picture.Other than that it has a great plot and great actors and weapons.
5,An Unexplainably Awesome Movie!!!!!,"I can't believe how good this movie is. When I saw it, i was totally amazed at how awesome it was!!! everything is perfect. The fighting is amazing, and so is the story! This is a need to see movie! Get it when it comes out! I Will!!"
4,Pretty darn good,"I had been expecting a good movie, and I got one. Much better than most of the slock that comes from Hollywood these days. The reasons that I didn't give it five stars were: 1)The dialodue seemed too close to the sort you'd see in anime (ie, blithe and uninspiring) 2)The ending seemed needlessly sad (I have never been fond stories about tragedy occuring due to stupidity). Nonetheless, a good offering."
3,Would like to like it,"But I can't really say I do. Beautiful, interesting-looking people. Fantastic scenery, scene-settings, buildings. Exquisite chinoiserie. The fighting looked more like some sort of balletic dancing performed to some exotic kind of rhythms. With strings attached. Unfortunately I couldn't follow anything of what was going on, and I was unable to sustain the interest and concentration necessary to say that I even halfway enjoyed it. It must be for buffs of this kind of thing. Perhaps if it was explained carefully all the way through, but I haven't retained enough energy or commitment to listen to the commentary. Ah, well, no doubt it's my loss. You win some, some you just lose. I lost it, and it lost me. Might flick through it again some time."
5,One of the greatest movies ever made,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a calm action/drama and adventure mixed into one to bring you a great production. The action sequences are great and the story is strong rather than weak like some other movies example, The Last Samurai, Underworld and Blade among the few. This oscar winning phenomenal movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and the entertainment is pure clean fun. I loved this movie, so has the world, and better wait up for the 2 disc collection due late 2004. 10/10."
4,"A film i saw 4 times at the cinema, cant be all that bad","In fact what it is is actually something really special. Based on what seems a very simple love story. Crouching Tigar Hidden Dragon is a brilliant mix of action, fantasy, martial arts and magic all mixed up in a colourful bowl of perfectly design music. Its a film you have to see more than once as so much goes on, the dvd is something not to be missed, slow motion options, so you can see how good they REALLY are and features that look set to take you deeper into this world of treetop battles. The best fight scene (for me) was the one in the court yard at night, like nothing i have ever seen... its really worth buying just for that.Enjoy"
2,Product with problems,"I've bought this BD because I love this movie, and it was announced in the Amazon website that was subtitles in Portuguese (I am brasilian). I was surprised, when I received the disk, that was subtitles in english, french and spanish, but nothing in portuguese. And, worst: the website continues to inform the existence of subtitles in portuguese."
5,brilliant,"i don't understand those people who hated the movie because of the special effects and how ""people can't fly"". hello: IT'S A MOVIE, fiction, not real. remember peter pan? he flew.this movie is pure fantasy, which is what i loved about it. but hey, to each his (or her) own, right? just remember, all you ""realists"" out there, to keep your mind open and remember that movies are where anything can happen. as Einstein once said: ""Imagination is more important than knowledge"""
4,mesmerizing and overwhelming,"I am not a fan of wuxia films, and I believe this film could have done with much less rooftop flying and bullet deflecting. It is an excellent story in itself and it also shows a lot about a dramatic historical period in China (late XIX century). In fact, in my view one missed opportunity of this film is that it could have told us a lot more about the historical context. Also, I think the plot is overly complicated, after a while I gave up trying to follow all its nouances. Yet, it is hard to fault the director for his imprint. It does make a coherent whole and it is impressive. It is also a movie about the endless dilemmas of love and loyalty.The sound track is beautiful as well and comes out well in the BD. Too bad there are no extras, at this price one would have expected some."
4,EYE POPPING!!!!,"I found this film to have such excitement that I couldn't let my eyes leave the screen. The special effects were not your Bruce Lee kind of ""Wha Pow"" kind of acts. But, a sweet love story with warmth that made you really identifiy with the story line. I know when it comes out on ""DVD"" I will be one of the first to own this asian epic."
4,"Classic action film, but appealing to all ages an audiences","Seen this movie many times, but finally shared it with my ten-year-old son. Such a great combination of low and high art. For my son, it is an intense action flick, but it works on so many different levels. The ultimate kung-fu flick that is also art house fare. I also like the very strong female characters."
4,True to it's genre.,"I've watched what seems like a hundred different Chinese wuxia films over the past few years, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is the highest quality I've ever seen in the genre.The acting was excelecnt, and I am so glad that I watched the DVD version, where I could choose between dubbed and subtitles. And although some may say that the special effects (the ""flying"" in particular) was poorly done, I must disagree. It was simply done in the style of the older films of the wuxia genre. The wirework was done in a slow, dramatic way to maintain an elegance, although in America with all of our fast paced gun toting heroes it just seemed slow.In other words, to people who are used to this type of cinematics, the film was great, for people who would rather see lots of fased paced shooting, killing, and such, you might be a little disappointed."
5,Why Zhang refused to become Chow's student in the movie?,"This is the hidden plot of the movie. Because Zhang admired Chow and his sword so much to a point where she actually fell in love with Chow. In ancient China, romance between teacher and student was forbidden as she knew it. That is why she kept refusing Chow when he insisted her to become his student and that is why she turned to become so mean to Yeoh. Remember the cave sence, where Zhang was bewildered. When Chow walked into the cave and found Zhang. She seduced Chow and asked him"" Do you want the sword or me?"" which really showed her lust for Chow."
2,Should not take the oscar,"I have gone to see the movie based on critics and commercial reviews that the movie is a candidate for OSCAR (best movie). I was disappointed as it lacks most of the qualities. 75% or more of the time were scenes for people fighting with each other, where is the art or creativity in that? The special effects are good but that is it. I remember I saw similar movies when I was a kid for Bros-lee and other Karatte heroes, but these were kids movies, not ones that compete for the Oscar. The acting was very unnatural and poor. And there was this long flash-back that took about 30 minutes, in which I thought I was seeing another movie."
1,Worst Martial Arts Movie ever made.,"Chow Yun FatEnough said. That Means The Movie is a stinker. His acting is terrible. He doesn't do any kicks or anything. I Was Disappointed in this movie, especially the end. This is a B-Movie at best."
2,"Thrilling Action, Boring Movie","A sure case of jumping on the bandwagon once this movie came out -- many people I talked to about it thought this was a big shrug and an awfully slow movie. Pack all the extras on the DVD you want, you won't catch me buying it. After a painfully slow first half hour, we finally get a fight scene and the action is pretty great (although, some of the infamous flying sequences are over the top). Unfortunately, the action is always followed by more dialogue and story, both of which are wretched. How this movie, with its ... dialogue (dumb lines like ""I will avenge my master!"" over and over) was nominated for a screenplay Oscar is beyond me. If you loved it, buy it. If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to rent this first -- I and others I know were excited when this came out in theaters, but thoroughly disappointed by the dullness of it all."
1,What the f...?,"What is this? Why is Hollywood so enamored with special effects and in this case having people fly through the air. It all started with Matrix and now it's everywhere. In this movie people are flying from tree to tree and jumping over buildings. I mean if you can fly, you've pretty much mastered one of the things that has always limited man. I would think there wouldn't be much to worry about after that. I known the martial arts movies of the 70's were also unbelievable, but those were usually the bad ones and were described as such. This one got rave reviews from the critics and it was annoying to watch. Unless you like fairies flying through the air skip this peace of garbage and buy a true martial arts movie like Enter the Dragon or The Chinese Connection."
1,The product does not match the advertised on Amazon,I was very disappointed when I received the product and available subtitles do not match the advertised. Also the deadline for returning now turns. Failure of Amazon or Sony?
1,It must be me....,"But.... I just found this movie to be horrendous. Bad voice dubbing, melodramatic acting, questionable plot, ineffective special effects(you can see the wires in a few of the fight scenes!), etc...The flying effects reminded me of the wretched ""American Ninja"" series. Me and my wife suffered through the entire movie. I found myself glancing at my watch wanting the suffering to end. The ending left us with a feeling of... that's it?!?!?I'm sure that many people will see this as a ""Deep"" and ""Moving"" storyline... that might be the 'trendy' thing to say but the movie is neither ""Deep"" nor ""Moving"". It is just flat out bad. I was waiting for the characters from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 to pop-up and begin heckling.I ""Deep""ly regret spending our money to view this film and, we should have kept ""Moving"" past the theatre."
1,"Ill be honest , do people really fly around on wires?","I dont know, this was on the most part really stupid, I did like the scenery but people were flying through it on wires, I could have enjoyed it just as much as I do the scenery in the ending shots of ""Sunday Morning"". But then when I was a kid I thought Peter Pan could have been better also, but at least that looked more real. Doug"
2,Kabuki Theatre 2000,"This movie was the same only a plot was added to a Saturday morning showing of Kabuki Theatre. The plot is weak at best, the acting (in any language) really comes up short. Visually and musically the movie was great, but the ridiculous flying was annoying to watch. The fighting was decent (if you like Kung-Fu), and the end was very predictable. The Oscars award foreign films, and CRouching certainly takes the cake, but the Best Picture....puh-leaze!"
1,Martial Arts Oscar,"I suppose if your into Martial Arts and Action movies you could give this one five stars. Plot is thin, probably because it would get in the way of the action scenes. The action scenes have to be appreciated for the athletic ability of the stunt performers, not for how they mesh with the story, most of which seemed to fit in like a comercial does when watching a movie on TV. I can't see, and will never understand why this movie ever got a nomination for ""Best Picture"". The fight scenes were so long I actually fell asleep in the middle of one toward the end. When I woke up, I never bothered to reset the DVD to see how the end turned out. The Cinematography, Lighting Design, Editing, Sound, and Sound Editing, Score were all excellent. These are the areas where most movies of this genre fall down; which is why this movie could be rated 5 stars within the confines of the category. But considering it on the whole, I can't give it more than one."
3,A movie that has everything,"""I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than to enter heaven without you.""Enough said. I criticize this film for the many times that it seems to focus on technical wows and high wire antics, often at the expense of potentially great drama. Chow Yun Fat's words in his final scene all make up for it though. This would be a truly great movie with less hidden wires and more Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together.The only thing that bothers me about the DVD is that you have to watch the same scenes over and over before accesing the menu."
3,The Most Over-Rated Movie of Recent Times?,"Spectacular production; trite story line; laughably bad dialog. In many places, this cartoon-like movie comes across like an old time ""tie 'em to the railroad tracks"" melodrama. The fight scenes are breathtakingly choreographed, but about as realistic as those in ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"". It's fun, in a goofy sort of way, but not the ""great"" movie that many people have credited it with being. A solid three stars, but no more."
3,Good and Bad,"I loved the scenery and the fight scenes, but the story was a little slow. They spend like half an hour on a side story that I didn't think had much to do with the movie. The fight scenes were great, but too few. I thought this movie was suppose to be all fighting, but it wasn't."
5,"Crouching Tiger, Little Dragon",An excellent movie well grounded in chinese philosophy and mythology. It brings an interesting twist to the star crossed lovers theme of the Wu Xia genre.
4,crouching tiger hidden dragon,This is the grestest Martial arts movie ever made. The only really down side is it is really short.
1,"Absurd, Plotless and Boring",The flying scenes were so utterly silly that I found myself laughing through most of them. The bamboo tree scene was particularly ludicrous. There is no plot development..none! The dialogue is stunningly boring and cliched. Ignore the undeserved praise for this waste of film and go buy a Jackie Chan flick!
3,"Great movie, it would have been 5 start if not for three ...","Great movie, it would have been 5 start if not for three anoying problems.1. DVD only contains the wide screen format, ie you see a black bar on the top and bottom of your screen.2. Only contain English & French subtitle. It should have at least contain Chinese subtitle for people the speak Cantonese.3. Should be dubbed in Cantonese"
1,Piece of Garbage!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I don't know how it won any awards. The plot is BORING and EXTREMELY MONOTONOUS and the fighting scenes are really STUPID and UNREALISTIC. All they are are people flying through the air. Hey I like fight scenes even when they're unrealistic if they look good (e.g. Romeo Must Die). But in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon they're just a joke. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, it's not fit for a dog."
4,A Surprise,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the kind of film I usually wouldn't bother to see since I'm not a fan of action blockbusters. However, everyone I know was trying to get me to see it; I thought I'd give it a try(Even though I normally don't go by hype, I still haven't seen ""The Gladiator"".) ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is more than an action film but can still be enjoyed that way. It has special effects which aren't just amazing to excite the audience but very beautiful to look at. It has a good script and story line. It has a somewhat spiritual connection. It has many aspects that can work with the average film goer to people like me who go more for Arty films. I wouldn't say it was the best film of 2000 or anything but it is worth renting."
4,Good not great,"As someone who doesn't frequently watch foreign movies with subtitles, I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie and that it is good. The scenery and the sets are a treat and the 3 lead actors are all good in their parts.Now for the buts: there are some good fighting scenes but all of a sudden, the characters would fly. Everything else is realistic and believable and then we have people flying. Why? But#2: a more upbeat ending would have probably made this a better movie. But#3: The part of the young Chinese warrior is played by an actress who looks like she's 90 pounds. There are scenes where she fights off large groups of 200-250 pound men and it would have been more believable with a bigger person in this part.It is still a good movie - however, for me, the 3 buts prevent it from being a great film."
4,Very well done movie..,"I don't think there's another Chinese movie that weaves together fanatasy, drama and romance so perfectly into one simple plot. Though not the best fantasy martial arts movie ever (Swordsmans 2 holds that honor), CTHD is still a remarkably well done movie. The acting is top notch. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are on top of their game. And newcomer Zhang Ziyi electrifies the screen with her performance.Ang Lee hit a cord with this film. He managed to raise the reputation of fantasy martial movies from B-movie status to true cinematic poetry. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a must have a dvd and a milestone in Chinese cinema."
4,Great for the kids,"In it 80's way this is still a great one to dust off for those young children, even those that are only so in heart, that still enjoy the turtles but need a little change of pace. Good positive message movie with lots of great action and comical acting."
3,An average fantasy flick with Eastern Philosophy,This film isn't as bad as the Nostalgia Critic made it out to be but it's not that good either.I found the philosophy to be an afterthought rather than an integral part of the story.The actor who portrays Ryan Jeffers is very talented and believable.They pronounce the word Tao incorrectly it is pronounced Dao.The infamous Kitchen scene is entertaining but very over the top.The scenes that take place in the real world are rather slow and boring.I'm a huge fantasy fan but I expect believability in my films.The best parts of the movie take place in Tao.I found that sheep character to be very annoying.I recommend giving this movie at least a one time view.
3,I Love This Movie Butt.....,"No really, this is a really great movie, but why in the hell did they have to only offer it full screen? Ronny Yu has filled the screen with such flourish that it seems a shame to loose almost everything with the full screen. Really...Ronny Yu, has created a lovely little film(shot in China and financed by a team of rich American Brothers), and t needs to be seen...Full Screen. Or for those of you at home, The widescreen copy. Plus..Big Major Point...It has Kung Fu Kangaroo's.Now how could you go wrong. And with kung fu choreography by Yen Wo Peng,this is a really great family movie. Plus it has the great Tom Towles in it. And a big villian, who loves purple. Good TimesThe man is a legdend."
2,Mediocre at best,"Not a great movie plotwise, it's rather silly. But oh MAN the character designs! If you're a fan of costuming, anthropomorphs, special effects, or kangaroos, watch this for the eyecandy!The costume design in this is wonderful. I can only DREAM of making something so realistic."
1,Warriors of bad acting and screenwriting,"This DVD was a default choice for my family looking for something that my 11-year old, 4-year old and myself could all tolerate. Tolerable is about the most charitable comment I could come up with. The costumes are impressive, the fight scenes interesting though not terribly original, and the overall premise has promise. Unfortunately, horrid acting, bad script and almost incomprehensible plot ruin what could have been an interesting combination of ""Legend"" and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". Barely worth the ... rental if you're really desperate and a waste of good optical data media."
1,"Anyone seen ""Tank Girl"" (1995)","They used those EXACT SAME kangaroo-people costumes from that movie, in this movie."
4,Great for bad movie nights,"This movie is terrible, but makes for an awesome bad movie night fodder. If you have a desire to subject yourself to bad cinema for laughs, get this."
3,Disappointing,"I am surprised to see such glowing reveiws of this album which, while occasionally moving is a disappointment. This album continues Lennon's descent into self endulgance at the expence of potentially good songs which was hinted at on Abbey Road's I Want You (She's So Heavy). GOD is the album's finest moment. Other fine moments are HOLD ON and LOVE, but ultimately the fact remains that John should and could have written a better set of songs for his first (proper) solo outing."
3,Self-consciously primal,"Often attributed as the post-Beatles most vibrant work, Lennon's simply composed, consciously unhinged rock-psych excursion does sound relatively weak alongside the energy he put in, and would largely fall flat if not for some charisma and some production intuition."
3,is it just me?,"Having bought all the Beatles albums, I was really looking forward to purchasing some solo work. I already had Paul's ""Band on the Run"" and George's wonderfully remastered ""All Things Must Pass,"" so I thought I would buy ""Plastic Ono Band"" as my first solo Lennnon CD. I was shocked! The music is horrible! I admit, I did like ""Mother,"" ""Working Class Hero,"" ""Isolation,"" and ""God."" But ""Hold On"" and ""Remember"" are throwaways, ""I Found Out"" is a nonsensical piece of garbage, ""Love"" is a hippie revelation, and ""Well Well Well"" is crap. I'm indifferent to ""Look at Me"" (it reminded me of the White Album's ""Julia""). The last album song, ""My Mummy's Dead,"" is haunting, but fails to justify the other dreck on this album. Obviously, primal scream therapy was good for John but not for his listeners!"
1,John Lennon assassinated twice.,"This WAS a great and brilliant record. One work, with nothing superfluous. Greedy boneheads have decided they can sell more copies by appending ""bonus [bonehead] tracks"" that DO NOT belong on it. First they shoot him in the head, then they murder the art he left behind."
5,Not For Amateurs,"This CD is not for people whose only experiences of John Lennon are ""Love Me Do"" and ""Imagine."" There are no cute love songs and few hopeful sentiments here. Instead, the listener is transported into the soul of a man searching to find identity and meaning after the death of a dream (The Beatles). In songs foreshadowing the grunge, metal, and punk movements, John rips off the sarcastic and bitterly humorous mask he wore during the Beatles years and sings, yells, and screams about his pain: the abandonment of his parents (""Mother,"" which will rip your heart out unless you are made of steel), the death of his mother (""My Mummy's Dead""), his disillusionment with life (""God""), and his love of Yoko (""Love""), all set to sparse guitar or piano accompaniments. If you want toe-tapping, sing-along songs or utopian fantasies, look elsewhere in the Beatles/Lennon catalogue. If you want a portrait of a star coming to grips with a lifetime of suppressed pain, look nowhere else."
3,Buy the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING instead!,This album is just too damn important not to have the best version available soon. Mobile Fidelity Sopund Labs is producing a Gold CD version of this album in 2004. I'm sure it will be well worth the wait. I think you can preorder now right here on Amzon.com.
5,Lennon Bares His Soul,"Plastic Ono Band is the most soul-baring artistic statement I've ever experienced. What you hear is the sound of a man who is in pain and is baring his very soul to the world.Lennon encapsulates all the rage, disappointment, resentment, and despair he was feeling at the time he made this album. Fortunately, he tempers his more negative feelings with small glimpses of hope and love. This album marks a huge transitional point of one of the most recognized pop stars in the world into a more mature artist who just wants a little time to sort things out.Clearly, Plastic Ono Band was, and still is, decades ahead of its time. It just doesn't get any more honest than this."
5,Lennon's best,"john's dark,in your face,brilliant album is better now than it was when it was released in ""71"" because it takes on a haunting quality,the fact that lennon died violently in the darkness of nighttime new york seems to coordinate with this album.i love this album,john scratched a lot of hurt,and heartaches,on the plastic of that album.the lyrics are words from a master composer,the songs are unforgetable."
5,A raw and painful experience.,"This is a very good album. It's painful, yes, but that's also why it's so listenable. The reason a lot of people like John Lennon so much is his brutal honesty. And that honesty is more on this album than any other. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band serves more as an autobiography than anything else he ever wrote. Whereas McCartney was artificial and smarmy, and Starkey was more or less talentless except for his drumming ( and a passable voice ), Lennon was brutal, lost, scarred, and raw. Rock stars never reveal this much about themselves, preferring to hide behind tired cliches and plastic ballads. John Lennon painted his musical canvases in blood and tears, and nowhere is this more obvious than John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band."
2,Go for the Gold !,"If I'm gonna pay this much for the CD, I'm gonna get the best and wait until the 24k Gold CD version from Mobile Fidelity comes out! Millenium version... pleeeeeze ;)"
3,"Help me, please","I really really really really want to like this CD, but I have not found an exceptional quality in it yet. I would really appreciate it if someone gave me insight. I have yet to see the light, and you don't know how badly I want to see it. Help me give it that extra star(s)."
1,Revisionist dreck,"The MFSL version has astonishing sound. However I had forgotten how banal this album was. Does anyone really care of the ""pain"" poor rich, heroin addicted John warbles on about? Once he left McCartney behind its obvious he was carried through the Beatles by Mac."
5,Soul baring,"i always thought john frusciante was the only artist who is brave and strong enough to bare his soul to the whole world., then i heard this album and it just amazed me, from the stark sound of ""I Found Out"" to the thrilling soul touching ""My Mummy's dead"".so if you are ready to see the naked john lennon soul, buy this album!"
5,Moving,"This record moves me so much that I can hardly bear listening to it.""Remember"" is a particulary haunting melody, coupled with introspective lyrics that harken back to John's youth. ""Love"" is the most beautiful melody, or one of the best, that I've ever heard. ""Mother"" is especially poignant in light of Lennon's mothers death at an early age.The most striking element of this record, though, is it's simplicity, with very sparce instrumentation. Another element that jumps out at you is the drumming. Yes folks, that's Richard Starkey, MBE, applying his tradmark fills to Lennons wonderful songs. The two were made for each other. Ringo's drumming brings out the best in every song.Hopefully one day, I can bring myself to listen to this record again without remembering Lennon's death."
4,John Lennons very personal album but mfsl mastering did not really reach the top,"I know the songs just from the first release as a long-play. I purchased this mfls-cd for better sound. The Songs on the CD are very personal. John Lennon's first solo album since the beatles disparted. So I love most of the songs. The Sound Quality is not very different from the 2000-mix by yoko ono, so I'm a litte disappointed. The 2 bonus titles do not really fit on this Cd."
5,awesome,"last night i purchased the mp3 album never heard none of lennons solo stuff besides imagine,instant karma so i took a chance and i was blown away by the genius of this album instantly became one of my fav.nuff said this album is great.also getting ready to bye another lennon album"
4,Plastic Ono Band,"I do believe that I have the original Apple release of this vynal, and now am able to enjoy this very heartfelt expression of John Lennon in the cd format."
3,I find it hard to embrace John Lennon's early solo work,"John was definitely the angry, bitter Beatle. With songs like ""Remember"", ""Working Class Hero"", ""Well Well Well"", and his atheistic ""God"" just doesn't promote the optimistic pleasures of routine life. Unlike Paul McCartney who let the disappointing break up of the Beatles pass and he just got into the studio and starting writing pleasant unbiased songs which only showed that Paul was the more listen-friendly Beatle which contributed much more strongly to the Beatles success.I can listen to John Lennon songs when I mix them up with the other Beatles solo work. But to sit through one whole John Lennon album, is kind of depressing. He expresses his more tender side with ""Love"" and ""Oh Yoko"" but Yoko seems to represent the only thing that he had faith in. He seems angry or just disapproves of everything else."
2,You people all believe the hype!,"I gave this two stars because the production is really good so songs that have minmal melodies still sound pretty good, but i can not listen to this piece of garbage because the lyrics are so terrible! ""working class hero"" is a travesty, a multi-millionare pretending to give an f- about others because he wrote ""All you Need is Love."" The incredibly self absorbed songs about his g-d_mned mommy are enough to make you wanna smack him. And while all of you are out there creamin in your shorts about how great ""love"" is, let's face it if a 12 yr old girl wrote that you would all think it sucks, but because it's from a self-absorbed 30yr old you fall for it. If you wanna listen to some real music here's a short list: Phil Ochs, Woody Guthrie, The Kinks, the Jam, heck even Mcartney is better then him."
2,I just don' get it,"From a die hard Beatle fan... Although at the time,it may have been great therapy for John and Yoko, Plastic Ono Band sounds crude and dated. The gift that John always had as a Beatle was to combine a conscience with great Rock and Roll....here he achieved only one."
2,oops! hims got an owee in his head!,"Somewhere along the way, Johnny jettisoned Paul - his previous soulmate - for a talentless performance artist. As a result, he produced a lot of twaddle, became a goshdarn real artiste (hooboy!), and made a couple of decent solo records. Actually, Imagine is pretty brilliant. POB is decent, barely. I do remember, though, that this was pretty cool stuff way back in the days when I was an angst-ridden teen. Knowing what kind of dad and husband John was to his first family - can you say NEGLECT? - it's pretty damn hard to care about his pain. Then again, he was too wrapped up in being ARTISTIC AND DEEP to really care about his responsibilities. That'd be OK, I guess, if he'd just made a better album."
1,OVERRATED!,"Poor, poor John. One of the most talented musicians in the world, from the most popular band in the world, and easily amoung the richest people on the planet. Yet, he's in PAIN, man! Call me old-fashioned, but it's difficult for me to shell out hard-earned money to hear Lennon whine and cry about how lonely and misunderstood he is. Perhaps if he had spent more time with his son, Julian, he wouldn't have felt so isolated."
4,"""i don't believe....""","first of all: this is the only ""solo beatle"" record you need -- it's by far the best of that lame, stale bunch. it's miles ahead of overrated nonsense like ""all things must pass"", ""imagine"", or ""band on the run"", but that doesn't mean it can hold a candle to the work the beatles did as a band. some perspective concerning this record is deperately needed -- 30 years of shouting ""masterpiece!"" at it isn't all that helpful, folks. granted, the record (for the most part) packs an intense, honest punch -- i've rarely doubted lennon's sincerity -- but what of the songs themselves? is there anything here that approaches the brilliance of ""strawberry fields forever"", or even something like ""I'll be back""? no."
3,this is hard,"It,s obvious John had some really big isues in his life and from this album it apears that he is mad at God. as far as music this album has some good vocals and instruments. John had a wounded hart and he defently needed the lord in his life not sing bad about the Lord. The Lord meaning my Lord and savior Jesus Christ. GodBless"
5,Men of the Bible review,The books are being used for a Men's Bible Study group and they find it very useful and they rate it excellent.
3,TOO MUCH INTERPRETATION,I find the book does not stand up to the stadard of her other books. Too much interpretation while trying to make the stories connect to our lives. The devotional aspects are good and help me consider things I otherwise would not. Thank you for the opportunity to express an opinion. Dr. Dee
3,Men of the Bible stimulates conversation,Good review of sometimes difficult to understand Bible verses. Written for daily readings with Bible verse references and good summary at the end of each chapter. Questions in each chapter help stimulate a hearty conversation.
5,Devotional,"Great book , for daily devotions or just to study. Thanks for a great book at a great price good job carry on."
3,Not worth the cost,"Although I have a lot of respect for Gushi Sensei's lineage, knowledge, and ability, I did not find the video worth the cost. It is short in duration and frankly did not contain very much information in my opinion. There are many conditioning exercises and methods in Okinawan Karate that are very beneficial, this tape just not include very many of them. With excitement I put the tape into my VCR and set back to enjoy a learning experience. At the conclusion of the tape I felt like I was short changed... As I stated, Gushi Sensei is a talented teacher and practitioner, but this tape certainly did not do him justice."
5,Gushi Sensei is amazing as always,I'm so glad I bought this wonderful video featuring legendary master Shinyu Gushi. This is traditional martial arts at it's finest. I'm also a practitioner of Pangainoon that is known also as Uechi-ryu or Shohei-ryu and I'm part of the Shohei-ryu which Gushi sensei was once a part of also. Gushi sensei now heads his own organization in America. This man is extremely powerful and always has been even in his older years today he is built like concrete and his skills are sharp as a razor. This video gives you a good taste of what traditional martial arts is like from one of it's finest masters. I would recommend this video to anyone because it's superbly presented.Jeff MillerPennsylvania
2,"Very, very short book - almost pocket sized.","This is a tiny book and although I like the idea of having a positve outlook and including your faith in your illness, I didn't find the book to be helpful with my indigestion."
5,If you are looking for sound medical advice... you can trust Dr. Colbert.,"The credibility of this doctor is outstanding... all of his books are filled with wisdom... I recommend any of his books highly. He writes with much authority, knowledge through his many years of experience and in simple verse that is easy to comprehend. He does not talk down to the reader, but uses many visuals to relate what he is presenting. His Bible Cure series is awesome!"
4,Chicago does Taras Bulba,"I just ordered this CD this evening, thus haven't heard it. But I listened to the Chicago Symphony performance on XM Classics tonight, which is why I ordered this disk. Very stirring!"
1,Disappointment from a great band,"I was disappointed in the sound quality of this CD. I purchased because Head East was one of my favorite bands growing up and I never missed a chance to see them in concert, even in the smaller venues that they were playing just a few years ago. It is definitely a live album, but the sound quality is really terrible. I think that it may even be one of the recordings that my friend Robin made on her Ross tape recorder that she kept under her jacket in the 14th row of one of their concerts. Fact is, they finally mastered the sound of vinyl on today's technology. Do yourself a favor, spend a little bit more and buy one of the other Head East albums that are offered."
1,Give us the original LIVE disc,The audio quality of this recording is hideous and embarrassing. It does a disservice to how they truly sounded. I own this piece of audio garbage... don't make the same mistake I did.
3,LEEBO337,This CD is missing a few songs that were on the album.. A real let down. Other than that it's pretty good.
3,"live on stage, head east","This is better than nothing. I would love to get a CD of their live album from the 80's, SO if they ever come out with the real live one. I will be the first to buy it !!!"
4,"Incomplete, but still great rock!","This CD presents 10 of the 17 tracks issued back in 1979 on the ""Live!"" double album; that's sad, considering the original album on vinyl (A&M SP-6007) clocks in at 74 minutes, so Universal could have released it in its entirety. ""Live!"" was HEAD EAST's 5th offering, recorded during the ""Head East"" tour (their 4th album) across the USA, and features Dan Birney, Roger Boyd, Steven Huston, John Schlitt and Michael Somerville, plus Stan Gill (keyboards) as a guest. The recording quality is alright, and the performance is honest. Not a spectacular album, but good footstompin' rock! As the band themselves said, ""Get Up And Enjoy Yourself""!"
3,Half of the original Live album but still it's good.,"I heard the original Live on vinyl and recorded it to cassette tap in the early 80's. I think the other reviewers are a little to harsh on the sound quality as I was impressed with the CD tracks which for me beat the original vinyl recording.Ditto on the comments about messing with the order of the songs. It takes from the energy of the performance. I found myself editing ""Since You Been Gone"" / ""It's For You"" / ""Never Been Any Reason"" back into the proper order they were recorded in sequence during one show on the ""Live"" album. It's a great set. I did a better job recombining them than they did cutting and pasting apart.""Take a Hand"" by Rick Springfield and ""Its for You"" by Lennon / McCartney won't be found on any studio album. They are both great tracks.I'd give it 4 stars (almost 5) if they gave us all of the original tracks."
3,Why go halfway???,"This CD is essentially half of Head East Live! What was the logic in creating this CD when the original Live album could have simply been put to CD?? All of the songs are taken directly from the Live album anyway! The song order is also strangely out of sequence: The CD begins by introducing the band, then the first thing you hear is John Schlitt asking, ""Are you still warmed up just a little""? Probably not, John. You have to play a few songs first! Even though the songs sound great as they did on the Live album, there seemed to be no thought whatsoever in putting this disc together. Legal issues??? Hmmm...maybe. Buy it anyway. It's as close as you'll come to Head East Live on CD."
3,Its okay at best..,"The times that I have seen Head East, I loved their shows. So the powers that be had better release the 1979 LIVE Album.. this CD is a quick fix for all you Head East junkies.. So it will fill the bill till they re-release the live one.. We can only hope that we won't have to wait too long.."
4,Replacement power supply for cooler,This unit was ordered from Amazon since it provided the 12v and current levels that I needed. The unit has been been working (more or less) continuously since it was ordered. Amazon delivery was very efficient and the price made it the best value.
3,Works for a while.,"I've owned this for almost 4 years. It has worked great for those years, powering mostly 12v air pumps for cars and bicycles, and inflatables. But now it is dead with no rhyme or reason. Wish it had more lights, or a fuse/switch , or some thing. Anyway, works fine for a while."
1,Disappointed!,I bought this product to inflate an airbed. The first converter received had a broken piece rattling around inside the case. Amazon sent a replacement that didn't work. I won't try again! Not a quality product. Thanks Amazon for great service!
1,Disappointing,"When this item arrived and I couldn't get it to work with my compressed air generator, I assumed I had misread the requirements. after reading other reviews, I think that maybe it's just a bad product. Unfortunately, after I bought this item, it sat in the garage for a while before I used it, so I was unable to return it."
1,Did not work.,I pluged it in and it did not work.And i do not know where to send it back to.Plus if i did i would have to pay shipping.My Return label got lost also.{ whitch} is my fault.B R K.
5,Excellent Converter,"I bought this for use in a small motorhome and pickup truck - it is superb in this arena. I experimented with it and tried using a 12V Air Compressor so it could be used off the 110v circuits - no way!! This is for light duty things, excellent for Fantastic Fans, etc - but not 12v compressors. I plan on ordering another now that Amazon has it on sale."
1,Junk Sunforce Adaptor,"I read some of the bad reviews, but I was convinced the good reviews overturned the bad. I was wrong. I received this unit yesterday and it never worked from the gitgo. I will not make this mistake again. I am now contacting Amazon about returning the unit."
1,Don't waste your money,"Cheaply made. I got it, plugged it in, and it burned out. Opened and found a transistor not even screwed in. Save your money. It wasn't worth the aggravation of returning it. I used it in my RV. I hard wired a wall socket instead. Works much better, and half the price."
1,big disappointment,"When we received this item it didn""t work at all. Had to return to Amazon and ordered a different brand, which worked great."
5,Good 12 Volt power converter so far,"I've only been using this power converter for a few weeks now, so I can't really verify how reliable it is, but so far it's been working fine. I bought it so I could use my Sharper Image car cooler in my office at work. I hardly ever used it in my car, so I figured I would get a power converter so I could use it on 120 volts AC in my office and keep juice and milk (and small lunches) cold. This fits the bill just fine."
5,Fits a need well...,"With all the different devices out there that always need car chargers and home chargers too, it's nice to eliminate the need to purchase at least half of those often expensive additional gizmos.Though this unit is rather large, it is very lightweight and can easily be tucked away anywhere, allowing you to use your car (cigar) adapter to silently charge all your devices while you're at home. Due to it's rather large size, I don't believe it to be the absolute best choice for travel unless space isn't a critical concern.There are cheaper devices that claim to do the same thing, but you'll get what you pay for with them!"
1,Doesn't want to work,I purchased this to run a small 3amp (half the rated capacity) pump. The pump runs for short time and then stops. I have unplug this unit from the wall and then plug it back in to get it working again. It then works for a short time and then quits again. I would not recommend that any one purchase this item.
3,Not really for spotlights.,"I bought this to use to power a spotlight inside a building because it is advertised to be able to do so. The problem is that the spotlight is 10 amps and the converter only powers things up to 6 amps. Don't buy this if you want to power any of the popular large spotlights available in department stores. It will be a waste of your money. It may work fine with other, smaller wattage items but I don't need it for them. Someone else will have to review it for that. The Amazon service was excellent: the product arrived quickly and in good condition. As for the price: any price is too high if the product doesn't work as advertised. And if you are thinking I should have checked the wattage first--you are right, I should have. Make sure you do the same if buying this to power a spotlight."
1,Weak,"I bought this to use with a Coleman Inflate-All Quick Pump so I could inflate bike tires and other things without having to be near a car. It did not produce enough power to even budge the pump, even though the manufacturer claims it will work with a pump or compressor.Make sure the seller will pay for return postage if you buy this. (Northern Tool & Equipment didn't.)"
1,Mine didn't work,I ordered this converter and the first one I received didn't work. I have another converter that runs my DC appliances just fine so I know it wasn't my appliances. I returned it and requested a replacement. The replacement didn't work either. I would order a different brand.
4,Excellent Product,"I purchased the AC/DC power converter for my 40"" Coleman Cooler and at first I thought it didn't work because there's something like metal that shakes in it, but I think that is supposed to happened. At any rate, the converter kept my cooler hot and cool for 3 days of traveling. I enjoyed having the option to switch from cold to hot. Great product!"
2,Does not work with my compressor,"I bought this adapter so that I could use my portable air compressor in my house. It does not work with my compressor. It is useless to me. Since the time that I wrote the preceeding three sentences, I have found a use for this item. I can use my cell phone's car charger in the house with it. It came in handy for a friend of mine who lost his regular AC charger. I am changing my rating from one star to two."
1,"DID NOT WORK, IT IS FROM CHINA, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT","I PLACED ORDER FOR THE SUNFORCE AC/DC POWER CONVERTER, IT CAME IN AND IT WOULD NOT WORK, AMAZON DID SEND A REPLACEMENT AND LABEL SO I COULD SEND THE BAD ONE BACK. WHEN I GOT THE REPLACEMENT IT DID NOT WORK EITHER. I WOULD RATE THIS PRODUCT A ZERO. AMAZON REFUNDED MY MONEY IN FULL. I WILL CONTINUE BUYING THRU AMAZON BUT TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING MADE IN CHINA. I ALWAYS BUY USA UNLESS THERE IS NOTHING AVAILABLE. I DON'T MIND PAYING MORE IF USA IS AVAILABLE BUT USA MADE PRODUCTS ARE NOT ALWAYS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ARE MUCH BETTER QUALITYTHANK YOUJERRY FROM TEXAS"
1,Does not work,"Despite expert advice this Sunforce product is not a powerful enough tool to convert my wife into an AC/DC fan. It does not work. No matter how long I use this tool she, to this day, does not appreciate the classic rock & roll stylings of AC/DC. Classics like Big Balls, and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap have yet to hit home with her. I'll have to re-read the instruction manual... perhaps I'm using this device incorrectly."
3,wait and see,Services provided by Amazon has no fault but I cannot give an honest opinion of this product because the converter is still untried.
3,Verify amperage rating before buying,I was looking for a product like this to power a rechargeable aerobed pump which I'm converting so I can run it directly from my wall outlet. I want to power it from the wall outlet because the battery no longer holds sufficient charge to power the pump. I came across this product and was surprised that it had a 5.8A ouptut rating at this price. I started to look around the web and came across this site ([...]) where it is listed as 1.8A. I couldn't find the manufacturers site but 1.8A is probably more accurate for this item. This would explain the problems posted with powering certain equipment. Bummer. Looks like my search continues :(
4,It workes as expected,"A good produt and I would recomened it to any body, and buy it again. I use it very often"
1,don't be a fool,"please don't be a fool as is cost a lot when you can have it at 50 cents or 1 dollar in asian market, chinese stores or indian, also malasian. Why pay more. Search well before throwing your money away it is not wrth the cost."
5,Share this book with someone!!,Our pastor handed this book out to the entire congregation on Easter Sunday. Our challenge was to read it and to pass it on to someone else. This book is the perfect tool for witnessing. It is short and can be read in less than 30 minutes. I have been a christian for more than 14 years and I was surprised how much I learned. It really helped reaffirm my faith. It is a must read for christians and nonchristians alike.
1,Funny,"I don't remember asking him to. I don't remember being created. ""Why?"" I wonder to myself.""You can't apply logic to this.."" I'm told. He doesn't speak to me. I can't see him. I can't hearhim. Hmm.. so we have something that can't be seen, heard or detected in any way..It's ALMOST as if He's not there.......... at all!"
4,OUTRAGEOUS LUNACY....,"Ok, let's be up front about this right from the start. This movie is not for everyone. It's raunchy to the point of being ridiculous... but I like it. It's a detective satire/black comedy that pushes the buttons of taste to the NTH degree. And it's just plain funny. But be warned, it's not for kids (or even high school kids)...no way. It's ""adults only"" in all respects. The acting is good, it's fast paced and even delirious at times (after all, it was made during the ""stoned age""---1971) but it is trashy and it was supposed to be. 70's underground fave Allen Garfield is in rare form (and I do mean ""rare"")....and there is a surprising face or two in this mix that you may recognize. But if full frontal nudity and dubious sexual activity offend you, steer clear of this comic farce. If you're the film buff who likes a good old raunchy romp, then you'll probably enjoy this. It looks great on DVD and Troma was the perfect source to release it. Thanks guys---you did good."
3,"A very amusing, tightly directed humorous of the old murder mystery formula...","Jake Masters (Allen Garfield) is a private eye detective hired by a wealthy man who is the prime suspect in the murder of a young starlet... It is Jake's job to find the real killer... He not only uncovers the case, but also a lot of hookers and call girls...The misadventures are highly comic and include sexual intercourse, unintentional necrophilia, and sinister lesbians... The sexual overtones are stimulating and funny... They are used more to comment on the hypocrisy of society than to derive unjust profit...There is a lot of soul in this film, especially in the performance of Garfield, who plays a very adorable investigator... Madeleine Le Roux is volcanic as the fiery blond who is as quick with a pistol as she is with her verbal assaults..."
4,Good choice for community college work,I have taught using this text for 10 years at our local community college in an engineering technology program.It is written clearly and concisely with excellent examples for all major concepts. The tables and appendices are easy to understand.The answer key text clearly show the solutions and is also good for exams. The book covers both semesters material for statics and strength of materials so a second text book is not required.This text is algebra based and is appropriate for those students needing an introduction. Serious students seeking higher level engineering education should select a calculus based text instead. Being a professional engineer as well as an adjunct faculty is a plus for teaching these classes. Unless you are an engineer you may be at a handicap if you attempt to teach this subject.
1,Wouldn't Even Provide Heat if Burned,"Presently, I am a student who is taking an Applied Statics class that is structured around this book. The teacher lectures directly from the book. In my experience in all of academia, have never encountered a book so utterly useless and vague. It does not provide any clear direction, it provides an equation, and an answer, but no means to get between the two. The explanations, if available, are laughable. I am using resources courtesy of various search engines and online posts from help sites that provide a more thorough explanation of processes involved. The book itself does not appear of been updated in at least my lifetime. I understand that the concepts remain the same, but update and do a more thorough job of explaining the processes involved, and the equations needed.If you are a student and your statics class uses this book, do yourself a favor and drop the class, and try to substitute, you will never encounter a text more infuriating than this."
4,Very good condition,I received this hard-copy in really good condition. Package arrived on time to me un-damaged.
5,Bellìsima voz....excelente versiones de Mozart and Haendel,"Rut Ann Swenson es dueña de una preciosa voz y excelente musicalidad. Nos entrega aquí una selección de obras de Haendel y Mozart, compositores de un especialísimo don para las melodías y expertos conocedores de las posibilidades técnicas de la voz para su época. Muy hermosa la versión de ""Da tempeste il legno infrato"" de la ópera Giulio Cesare de Haendel donde su voz se torna ligera y muy fresca.Preciosa tambien la interpretación del aria ""Martern aller Arten"" de ""El Rapto del Serrallo"" de Mozart.The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment dirigidos por Sir Charles Mackerras simplemente exquisita."
2,A bland misfire from a good singer and conductor,"Ruth Ann Swenson is a highly accomplished and enjoyable singer, but not an all-purpose one. Her rich, full tone, accurate coloratura, easy high notes and beautiful trill work wonderfully in ""Rigoletto"" and in ""La Sonnambula,"" for example; she seems dramatically committed and engaged in those roles, too. Here, she seems detached, clueless and stylistically at sea -- neither her tone nor her phrasing conveys the luscious sensuousness of Semele's arias, and her Mozart is similarly bland and uncomprehending. It's surprising that Charles Mackerras, usually a superb and enlivening conductor of both these composers' music, could not stimulate or lead her to something better."
1,"Great scanner, doesn't work on Macs!","This is a very well put together scanner, and one of the only ones on the market with a built-in working transparency adapter. Unfortunately, Microtek still hasn't put out a version of their scanning software that works with Mac OS X 10.5, so it's completely useless for any designer or photographer using a Mac."
2,Unreliable,"I have had the 5950 with the document feeder for awhile, there are two issues, one minor, the other major:1) the document feed crinkles the front edge of the paper2) when the unit was new it would start and run with no problems. As it began to age I started to have the common 'blinking ready light' problem. I must power down and repower the unit in order for the blinking to stop. Many times I cannot get this to stop and must leave the unit for a day or two. The fact is that you never know when it's going to work.I recommend not getting this unit. For the cost, I expect a more reliable piece of equipment."
4,Easy to use,"You can use it as scanner, fax machine. Easy to use. Can't beat the price with these lots of functions. It cannot get 5 stars because the setting of the one touch buttons are a little complicated. Worth to buy."
5,Learn to cook.,"Excellent demonstrations and recipes.Most involve layers of vegtables and meat cooked together.The narrator is so so, but does get the point across.The landscapes are beautiful."
5,An unexpected and wonderful new album from Thomas Chapin,"If, like me, you mourned the terrible loss of this wonderful musician when Thomas died so young, then this release is for you.There have been a number of Chapin live albums over the years, each with its own strengths. When I read of a new live CD coming out of the blue I looked forward to another hour or so of great music.I was blown away. For me this is the best live release of his, ever. The three players are on peak form and Chapin just takes things beyond anything I expected.A truly wonderful recording which is a must for any Chapin fan but is also a great place to begin for anyone looking to learn about this music."
2,This is Columbian?,This coffee does not taste like Colombian to me. It is rather bland and does not taste too much different than any grocery store canned coffee. I was quite disappointed. The cost was quite a bit less than others available which is why I tried it but I will pay more next time to have better quality. The beans look rather dry with little evidence of oil on them and it seems to be a medium roast. I brew my coffee using a Melitta type cone and make each cup as needed. Sorry but I just cant recommend this one.
5,Worth the money,"This is a great product, and the seller was very good too. I have used them to keep clean in a semi, but I'm about to have a surgery, and I know they will be helpful to me now. Thank you !"
1,Disappointed,This product was a great disappointment. I have used other products that are much better. My biggest disappointment is the size.
3,Useful to have around,"I use it personally. Don't care for the fragrance, but if it cleans, I won't argue. Tough to bathe everynight, so every other night I just do a quick wipe down. Just microwave for short time to warm up towelettes. They are pretty thick and easy to use. Just need to pick up the no rinse shampoo now."
5,Lifesavers,"These Comfort Bath Disposable Washclothes are great! They are great to take along in the RV in case you are short on water or lack of. Most importantly, after surgeries when you are limited to showers/bathes they are the perfect way to take care of your hygiene. Heat up in the microwave and toss away - no rinse necessary. Everyone should have them on hand!!"
5,Easy clean,"Although these washcloths are intended for bed baths, they are also a quick and convenient way to clean up quickly after a workout, especially if you don't have time for a shower."
4,The Comfort Bath system worked really well. I ...,"The Comfort Bath system worked really well. I used it while camping. Although this isn't what the product was intended for, it came in very handy. It was so convenient to have something like this while traveling. The other thing I didn't like was their smell. It was a little strong and definitely reminded me of a hospital. People who use this for what it's intended may be put off by the odor, that's the last thing I'd want to smell. Overall, I think the product worked very well, but the scent could be improved."
4,Very Nice.,"My mother was given some of these during a recent stint in a rehab facility. When she came home she was hooked on them. The only thing that could be improved on is if they were flushable. All in all though my sister and I are happy with the size, thickness and ease of cleaning her up with these rinse free wipes."
3,"I thought it was a great idea, until ...","I thought it was a great idea, until I actually used it myself. I had surgery and was unable to bathe. (I couldn't get my stitches wet.) I loved the feel of the thick washcloth, but I couldn't stand the soapy solution. I kept thinking that even though it said on the package that the soap evaporated, I didn't think so."
1,stinky cloths,"i could not fine the bath cloths at my local pharmacey so ordered them from amazon, they smelled terrable. But were thicker then some of the other ones i purchased from other places. Need to improve the smell, smells to much like medicine."
4,Great movie,"Made just one year after ""The Women"", female director, Dorothy Arzner, makes this movie about a group of women and their struggles to break into show business. Lucille Ball plays Tiger Lilly, who is self centered, uses what she got to get what she want and does get top billing in a burlesque show. She gets Maureen O'Hara, who dances but more to a ballet type to be her ""stooge"" with the show, and with things the way they are with the Depression, she does it for the bare necessities and suffers her ""art"". To complicate matters, she and Ball get involved with a divorcing playboy(Louis Heyward)who still has a soft spot for his wife(Virginia Field),while another man who owns the ballet company(Ralph Bellamy)has a thing for O'Hara. Some may say this is no classic, I disagree.It's a landmark film dealing with the plight of working women with feminist themes. For that, it is worth the mention as well as Lucille Ball's performance & O'Hara's speech in the burlesque hall."
1,Do not buy this,"When my spouse died of lymphoma and our featherbed and mattress pad needed to be replaced, I shopped around and decided on this one. After three months, I started noticing scratches on my back, and I felt around in the bed. I found pin feathers sticking up through the mattress pad, dozens and dozens of them, just like a bed of nails! I stripped the sheets, and when the mattress pad came off, HUNDREDS of feathers shook loose. The shell this $170 featherbed is made from is so cheap that it leaks nail-like feathers that can even penetrate a very thick mattress pad! How ridiculous is that? I've left an email to try and return this thing, but haven't heard back yet from the company."
4,Never ceases to amuse,"I bought this for my 6 year old son. He never ceases to be amused by Wallace and Grommet, and watches them all repeatedly, year after year."
3,Make sure you get the real book 1st,"I ordered this book without getting the first book that goes along with it. Make certain you do, this is just a workbook."
2,"Important! Get the real book, not the workbook","Like one other reviewer, I also inadvertently ordered the workbook instead of the actual book. It's a n easy trap to fall for because: i) it can be particularly confusing as the same editorial/customer reviews & product description is atrributed to both texts, ii) the workbook comes up first in regular searches on Amazon, iii) the frequently bought together texts are actual text books from other authors. You would expect that the workbook would be frequently bought with the actual text.All this is a bit misleading (falling short of calling it a scam) for those of us that quickly flick through and don't pay attention to all the details. It was a particularly expensive mistake for me as I live abroad & had this delivered under international shipping. Please be careful."
3,This Company Stand Up for themself!,I Had ordered this Red Laser that's here before you either it was label wrong when I ordered it or I miss read the title I thought this was a Red Laser the like some of the 200 nW green laser I thought it read 650nW w/h 532 wavelength. But it turnout to be Only 5nw and 650nm Well I was really bummed out but the people here got word of the either miss print and E-Mail a Returned Label and offered a FULL REFUND TO ME! The cost of the Laser AND the cost of Shipping & Handling Cost !These Guys are One of The GOOD Guys in a Sea of Bad Internet Companies and Scam Artist. And they waved The restocking Fees!!! These Guys are The Best!!!!!!!
4,genius in the making,"This extraordinary author can create gritty realism like no other,you can smell the band aid in the mash potato.Although a first novel and no match for the classic The shipping news (which is my all time favourite book) one can glimpse the genius of the Pulitzer Price winner shining through these pages.I dont understand people who find her book a tough read.The stories are as plain as day and the language is completely down to earth. The story is a tale of tragic proportion,life holds no redemption for the Blood family,the anti hero Loyal Blood (the name alone is worth a prize) goes from the favourite son and hope of the family to a bum scavenging gabage for meals. But before he gets there we get to meet some of the quirkiest odd ball in American history.Although a very clever and honest book,the ending is a little bit unsatisfying but that is life,after a lifetime of bad luck due to his unforgivable crime Loyal is left to face a fate worse than death : living."
2,PLEASE read Shipping News instead!,"I picked up this book because I was so impressed and entranced with the Shipping News... I was sorely disappointed. Everything I enjoyed about the Shipping News (the lovely flow, the fully realized characters whom you grew to care about, the simple and clear vision) was missing from this novel. It felt fragmented, confusing, muddled... and I had no sympathy with the characters because they seemed rather one dimensional. I would hate for people to neglect reading the wonderful Shipping News because of Postcards (or because of the dismal and horribly miscast Shipping News movie - Kevin Spacey as Quoyle! What were they thinking?)."
4,Prickly Proulx,"I forgot how much I really liked this book. After my, oh, sixth or seventh read, I have to say there is much to admire with just a few complaints. Proulx is unique and her characters are almost always hardboiled and flawed, her settings depict harsh landscapes and tough surroundings : that's her, that's what she writes about. She's a realist, but appears to hold up every detail for examination, every act for rehashing, and her details can become so overloaded that I have to back up and reread just to get the picture in my mind before I can go further. Her people are eccentric, you really can't ""like"" them perhaps, but you have to admire them. Here are folks you probably wouldn't want to have as your best friends, but that's what makes them such good reading. The postcards at the beginning of each chapter are a creative introduction and cleverly segue you into the action. If you're just beginning to read Proulx, this is not a bad place to start."
5,Postcards,"I bought this book about 10 years ago and enjoyed it so much I have read it 3 times. The descriptions are very detailed and authentic, but so well crafted they never seem excessive. The author moves seamlessly and gracefully between several different plot lines, each of them interesting and compelling. I am an Annie Proulx superfan, and have read almost all of her books."
4,A Lonely Man Roams the Country After Killing HIs Lover,"This novel is a saga about a man who roams the country after killing his lover. His adventures, isolation, and torment are shown in brief life clips.The discontinuity, disconnectedness and dysfunction of families is displayed in a bare, bleak and poetic style, both directly and metaphorically.A postcard introduces every chapter, in keeping with Proulx's style of having a fiing knot introduce the chapters in The Shipping News. This book is not as riveting as 'Shipping News' and I ended the book having enjoyed the literary experience and Proulx's style but still wondering about what really happened."
3,How'd she get so smart?,"Postcards left me awestruck at Proulx's ability to write with such matserful confidence about such a wide array of activities - mining, prospecting, trapping, archaeology, farming and the many other unfortunate and economically marginal ventures that Loyal Blood in particular tries his hand at. I also appreciated her willingness to challenge the reader to figure things out for himself rather than spell matters out. That said, I found the book more impressive as a virtuoso display of writing skill than an enjoyable read. I'm glad that with The Shipping News she chose to focus on a narrower canvas and explore a single time and place and way of life in greater depth."
2,Tedious and Unengaging,"I bought this novel solely based on the remarkable, relentlessly original novel ""The Shipping News."" As much as I tried, I was not drawn in to the plot, the characters or the atmosphere of ""Postcards,"" and I finally just gave up and put the novel away. However, I will eagerly await Ms. Proulx's future works, secure in the belief that even though she stumbled in ""Postcards"", she will ultimately write fiction as good as, if not better than, ""The Shipping News."""
2,I have to agree with some others..,"this book just didn't do it for me. I haven't read Shipping News yet, and wasn't going to after reading this book. But after reading some other reviews, maybe I will give that a try and it will be better. I sure hope so! I could never figure out who was talking and was confused a LARGE part of the time reading this book on what was going on. I hated reading the postcards at the beginning of a new chapter to find out what was going to happen.I really don't understand the meaning of this book, but am glad for one thing. IT'S OVER!"
2,What the...,"Proulx is like Faulkner for me... I know they are both brilliant writers, but I don't really get them. Actually, I thought I got The Shipping News, at least I really liked it, and I was enjoying Postcards until the end. I won't give away anything (unlike some reviewers, ahem) but there were far too many unanswered plot questions and character motivations. I felt sure we would be given some closure on the opening event, at least that we would find out more of the circumstances, but no, we were left hanging. That is only one example of many. I wouldn't say this book is a toal waste of time, but it is far from satisfying. However if you liked it, may I recommend Reflections in a Golden Eye by Carson McCullers. Same kind of thing, but more evocative in my opinion."
2,Gratuitously nasty,"Annie Proulx' vivid prose took my breath away. She has an amazing ability with words--metaphors, similes--every sentence an artist's delight. That to me is the strong point of this book. On the down side, it completely lacks a single sympathetic character. The characters, particularly Mink, were for the most part brutes, cruel to each other, and especially to animals. Had there been a single case of tenderness or love for someone or an animal, it would have been more fully formed. Because I couldn't care about the people in the book, the continuous chain of disasters were not so much depressing to me as just gratuitously negative. I certainly wouldn't see the book as a lesson of ""what happens when the family farm disappears""--so much as a chronology of the lives of people making profoundly stupid choices with little grace. I liked the Shipping News much better."
4,A Slog Worth Taking,"Postcards, Proulx's first novel, is not her best, but it is a damned fine piece.The mastery she applies in later works is almost fully developed here. Each chapter is a vignette igniting another match to illuminate the darkness of soul and society. Yet the novel is as enthralling not only for what it says and how it says it, but for what it doesn't say, requiring the reader to connect the gaps with extensions or experiences from his own life.It's not an easy book. Proulx is weighty in tone and language. At times the text almost gels, slowing. That is part of the art: reader feels the weight as he slogs on.I fault only one thing: the text accelerates and distances itself from the characters as the novel progresses. By the end of the book, Proulx feels more like she is tying up loose ends and less like she is laying out the final exposition of theme and heart.Postcards is well worth a read."
1,"Boring, draggy, poorly written, riding on the coat-tails of THE SHIPPING NEWS","This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. There are chapters that are absolutely incoherent and have to be skipped over. The story just drags on and on and on. I enjoyed THE SHIPPING NEWS. I was not aware that this author had also written BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (which I have not read). I found the movie BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN quite annoying and ridiculous.I absolutely do not recommend this book if you are looking for something interesting to read. If you are seeking a pretentious, purposely convoluted read for a literature class, by all means, read this."
5,Superb Rusalka,"This was the first Rusalka I ever listened to and it still remains my favorite, despite more recent recordings. Gabriela Benackova as Rusalka is in splendid voice here and Vera Soukupova sounds delightfully Slavonic as Jezibaba, the Witch. This set is not expensive but would, even at full price, be worth every single penny. A full five star recommendation!"
3,A repitation for regular readers of christianism,this book could be an enlightening book for the new members of christianism but as always there have been very well written books about the parables of lord jesus. This book is an outline and would nnot recommend if you are a regualr reader of such kind of books. It is well written tho as always we find some parts in the book debatable.
2,Disappointing,"Normally, I love this series. There's humor, an interesting plot,and engaging characters. This book, however, fell short, literally and figuratively. The book can be read in a few hours, which is one of the main problems. I felt that the storyline was rushed. The reader is rushed from scene to scene. It's almost as if the author couldn't wait to finish. The plot is mediocre and the characters uninteresting. This book was a departure from an otherwise excellent and engaging series."
3,Not really a murder mystery,"It was okay, very short, but no murder! That was too bad. But at least we got to see how Hamish got his dog, Lugs.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
1,Not worth the money,"This M. C. Beaton book would have made a good magazine story at Christmastime, but not worth the money now."
5,In the Spirit of Christmas,"I was very pleased to be able to fit A Highland Christmas into my own Christmas season. To all of us who know that a sudden sibilancy in Hamish McBeth's accent is because he is becoming angry: M.C. Beaton greets us with a wonderful highland holiday season. Yes, I am a fan. This is my sixth experience with Hamish (my favorites: Death of a Prankster and Death of a Macho Man) and I hope to read them all."
4,A Highland Christmas,"I have read all of the Hamish Macbeth mysteries and enjoyed every one. This was a very enjoyable read, too."
4,A Highland Christmas,"I enjoy M.C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth mysteries, and this is typical of the series, though shorter than most (more of a novella than a novel at 129 pages in paper). This is consistent with her other books starring Hamish in terms of the type of mystery, the characterization of the villagers, and the gross unprofessionalism of Hamish's superiors. It's a typical Christmas tale of redemption and inclusion, not a murder mystery like the majority of the other books in the series. Pleasant light reading, without much depth - good for a quick trip to the Highlands and visit with Hamish, if you're a fan of the series.Note on the Kindle formatting: Good. There were a couple of errors, but nothing worth commenting upon, and nothing that would impact the readability of the Kindle edition."
4,Highland gift,"This little Christmas novel is a lovely holiday gift from MC Beaton. It's fairly light, fast-moving and short, but it's delightful. Haimish moves across his beat as Christmas approaches and, using his wits, his mindful stubborness and his gentleness and courage, he meets and solves a number of challenges, and thereby turns Christmas into something special for a number of his village ""charges."" The story of Mrs. Gallagher and her cat was, without question, my favorite of Haimish's Christmas mysteries.Although not the best, Highland Christmas is one of my favorite of the Haimish MacBeth series. Just the most fun. This book is not a big deal, but if it doesn't leave you smiling, you're made of stone."
4,Hello Kitty set,"My daughter loved this set except that when it came, one of the DVD's inside was open and broken. I didn't return it because my daughter, who is 4, didn't want it to ""go away"" and frankly I didn't want to deal with it."
4,Bugcrushed...,"Not a huge fan of Boys Life films but had heard a lot about Bugcrush and it definitely lived up to expectaions. Creepy, erotic and wayyyy sick...loved it."
2,"You may like it, you may not, I didnt. C- rating",I've seen other videos in this series and liked them. This one was my least favorite. None of the videos did anything for me or provoked any desire to watch them again. Would NOT reccomend.
2,Meh,Thanks for presenting this in the wrong video format. It's stretched out to 16x9 when it was obviously filmed in 4x3 standard. Everyone and everything is widdddddde-ass. Someone out there get a clue.
2,A little boring,"The bugcrush story is pretty creepy, but a little confusing at the end, this is worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy. The other stories are pretty boring and not really worth wasting your time on."
3,He is a Bit Bitter,"Boy was MI5 asleep at the wheel. It is really something that this level of KGB penetration could take place, especially in a government that was so focused on the issue of stopping the spread of communism. This book details the search for the highest place KGB spy ever. As the story unfolds you almost think maybe the author's superiors were all in the pocket of the KGB, were too arrogant or self absorbed to think they had an issue, or so incredibly incompetent that they should have been taken out and shot once the issue came to light. Regarding the telling of the story the author does a good job given he is not a professional author. The British properness comes out at times and there is no hiding his bitterness toward his old employer. I have read a few books on this topic and this one would be my choice, not necessarily because of the level of detail, but because this guy was involved in the issue. A good book and a must if you are interested in the topic."
5,an excellent account of russian spies in England.,"learning from a spy who actually served in the intelligence field and documents the infiltration of russia into their counterparts in Britain was intriguing, informative and schocking. it is a memorable book to see the degree to which people and countries will go when something is desired. while the cold war has mostly passed as we knew it, there surely will arise new situations in the world where these sorts of dealings and situations will affect countries and citizens. for examle, the u.s. and china regarding nuclear secret espionage. what goes on between government leaders and between countries now? very rarely do people find legitimate information if ever at all. this book is one of those rare cases, delivered by someone on the inside. -9/22/1999 ."
2,Why all the fuss?,"I thought that this book read like a Harry Palmer novel. It appears that this book is written by a very vindictive man who did not receive a pension from MI5. Even though the organisation are not to be trusted, this book does not really achieve anything. Information displayed in this book can be obtained from other sources.I do sympathise with Peter Wright and his situation, however, his book does not really ""strike a cord"", it does not have a real aim. There is information though, that certain figures in MI5, did attempt to remove Prime Minister Wilson from office in the 1970s. But really, the book is otherwise best avoided."
2,Are you kidding?,"Please, tell me Chex is kidding. This snack food claims to have half the fat of potato chips. But that doesn't make it healthy and it certainly does not taste good.The stuff takes like a cross between cardboard, Reeses peanut butter cups and carmel corn, with a smidge of chocolate to tease and salty pretzels thrown in. Sheesh. The cardboard taste especially stands out.Don't food companies have something better to do than come up with expensive new marketing ploys that offer nothing in terms of good taste, not to mention reasonable value for the buck?Blech"
5,Real people/Real-life romance,"Jo-Ann Mapson writes so real it hurts! Hank and Chloe are flawed human beings; they belong together, but their problems seem unsurmountable. Mapson provides no glib solutions, no easy fixes; love is hard, and it doesn't always work out. She is a terrific writer, one who deserves to be more popular and appreciated. This is mainstream women's---and men's!---fiction at its best. What a lovely story."
4,A hot romance and - bonus! - the horse world,"""A romance that won't embarrass you to be seen reading"" is how Cody's Bookstore in Berkeley described it in their list of recommended summer reading, and they turned out to be right. It's a well-written, involving, passionately hot romance. An added bonus is that everything is centered around the world of horses, starting with the first chapter in which a foal is born. I have friends, who, like Chloe, live in the horse world and loved the accurate description of what that's like. I'm only giving it 4 stars because ultimately everyone really is a cliche, albeit real characters that I cared about, if that makes sense; 5 stars are for extraordinary books. I loved it, couldn't put it down, and put the sequel, Loving Chloe, on the reserve list the day after I finished H&C."
2,Ugh...Rather boring,"I usually purchase books by authors unknown to me using the member ratings. These also interested me because of the horses as I've owned horses most of my life. Well, I got about 6 of Mapson's books based on this and am through with Hank and Chloe and reading Shadow Ranch. I couldn't wait to get through with Hank and Chloe, (I rarely do not finish a book no matter how mundane I find it) as my opinion was that it was very boring. Now reading Shadow Ranch, I am experiencing the same thing. To think I have 4 more of her books to read I am hopeful at least one of them will allow me some good entertainment. I am sorry for such a lousy review but my disappointment is heartfelt."
3,Not for everyone,"This thriller is an excellently made film. I won't go into all the reasons here, as they're covered in most of the other reviews. The best thing about it is that it's in no way predictable, but neither is it unbelievable. The directer gave it a great atmosphere. While one is watching it, it's difficult to put a finger on exactly what's unsettling, but it is. I gave the film 3 stars because it's not for everyone; even those who like thrillers (like myself) may be slightly turned off by the protagonist's actions. For me, the conclusion and his actions (which I won't reveal here and spoil the film) left me unsatisfied. I rented the film with a free coupon and was glad I got it free, it's not a film I'd pay to watch."
3,Not As Good As the National Reviews Are Saying,"Pretty good, but nothing special. A rather forgettable little thriller"
2,Disappointing,"In usual Hitchcockian fashion, this French thriller is about ordinary folk plunged into sudden terror, but it speeds up and slows down gracelessly; peppered with a few murders here and there, it's just your average two hours of ennui. The first murder scene is so shocking (because the film has otherwise been so dull) that it really wakes us up, if only for the next ten minutes. There's a lot of useless filler material, like phone conversations of which we only hear one end, which in any case turn out to be completely irrelevant to the plot. There's none of Hitchcock's crackling tension, sexual or otherwise, to keep things interesting. Harry has moments of humor, but they are out of place and oddly disproportionate. With all of its boring mystery and emotional detachment, it feels at times like an amateur L'Avventura, with an added scene of Anna being brutally murdered on the rocks, minus the lyricism and profundity."
4,"Tense, pleasant surprise","Hitchcock with a French accent. Wonderful actors, unique characters, a splash of black comedy, and a few murders. Definitely worth an evening out."
5,overlooked gen,This was a terrific movie that has been missed by most audiences. (The stupid Miramax-imposed title doesn't help.) Anyone who loves the work of either Hitchcock or Patricia Highsmith will love this.
2,Hitchcock wannabe,"This movie was too ""in-your-face"" to be a thriller.It lacked any finesse. It was not polished and in the end, I felt a little cheated.I have many of the movies done by Alfred Hitchcock & David Mamet. I find their movies well directed and have some genuine tense moments that leave you guessing what's going to happen next.This movie however is about as subtle as a kick in the groin. The acting is passable but certainly not as enjoyable as a Hitchcock or Mamet movie."
3,Predictable but Good Acting,"The plot is predictable & a bit slow in the beginning, but Sergi López gives a great performance as Harry."
4,A little Movie Getaway 3.5 stars,"A refreshing break in recent movie releases. I found this movie entertaining through the French people's mannerisms among eachother AND with my recently subsided curiosity about, ""who lives in those random, abandoned looking hillside houses spread out between the windy roads between Switzerland and France?"" Often this movie seemed predictable although it had always side stepped my expectations. A little bit odd at times, perhaps the culture, but more likely what makes the movie tick. Well worth the left turns. Hitchcock a la Francaise!"
2,Typical Noirish dreck,"As a good friend of mine once said ""just because it is in a foreign language doesn't mean it's good"". He said this to me due to my everpresent need to see the latest foreign film released in the U.S. I thought that this film would be one of a few lone bright spots in a horrid summer of movie watching but it was just a bad as any hollywood thriller. The film wasn't poorly made so much as it was like any film student's script. The elements for a winner were present. The idea of the friend from college becoming obssesed, and the novel needing to be written, these had the trappings of a true and unique film but fell terribly short of the mark, digressing into common b-movie techniques to portray... what? The same thing you could see in any American film in the same genre.Certianly a pass."
5,a scholarly source,"While the author was a Protestant, it is clear that his aim was to produce a scholarly, un-biased, and non-sensationalized biography of Padre Pio, and, in this he seemed to succeed quite well, better than certain Catholic biographies (His life is dramatic enough; it does not need to be stylized and dramatized to make it interesting. The facts of his life stand on their own). The ample use of footnotes and references is also appreciated, so that anyone could check his sources, if needed (something that all biographies should have in the first place). Perhaps the only drawback is that the author, on a couple occasions interjects personal opinions tainted by his Protestant background. But most observant Catholics will disregard these anomalies."
4,Informative,"This book is very informative and includes some very nice pictures of Padre Pio. Although Padre Pio fascinates me, I must say that this book has been very difficult to get through. There are so many names, and it is easy to get them confused. However, I do recommend this book about Padre Pio because it seems quite factual."
5,A very good book,"This book, on Padre Pio, is the best I have read to date. It is a wonderful and informative book on the life of Padre Pio, a very kind and holy man. The miracle and stigmata in his life. There are many photos included as well."
3,Padre Pio: Ruffin,"I found the book mostly informational, but for some reason, it was not exceptional inspiring. I believe Mr. Ruffin is quite accurate, but I don't connect with his style."
5,AWESOME!,This is an awesome biography of St. Padre Pio. Don't let the length of the book scare you: I couldn't put it down. It is an amazing book that accurately portrays this holy saint.
4,fasinating,"i had over the years heard a lot about padre pio, but not knowing in depth his journey. the suject of stigmata i think draws a lot of people in to think about religion, sometimes in certain so called horror films not in the right way. this to me is another fasinating subject which in myself brings me closer to my faith. even if you are not religious in any way, but caurious about life and subjects in general this is a great read within its self. i had hoped for some colour within the book to make it really come alive, but overall i would highly recommed this read."
5,Great book!,In the mid 90's I was deployed in the area of Italy where Padre Pio lived. I learned a bit about this amazing priest Padre Pio from the locals; so when a wonderful lady at my Church offered me this book I was thrilled to fill in the blanks.The book is well referenced and has a good bibliography. I really enjoy learning about the lives of truly great people; not just the final years or what made the papers.Highly recommend
3,Much fine material but terrible editing,"I just finished reading this book. Most of it was very well done, but the author who is non-Catholic had a bad habit of inserting irrelevant material relating to Martin Luther and other Protestant luminaries in order somehow to bridge the chasm between the holiness of St. Padre Pio and the religious experience of these other individuals. It all has the smell of an ecumenistic work, a suspicion given added weight by the liberal nature of the publishing company. St. Padre Pio was a great saint for modern times. Like all saints he loved all humanity, but his personal love for souls did not, in any way, include acceptance of the errors they espouse. It is inexplicable that this author, who apparently believes what he has written about the saint, did not at the end adjure the errors of Lutheranism and enter the Catholic fold."
2,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!,"This pair of earrings is very pretty but a few problems. First, they are not as big as they seem. Second, they are very fragile. Third, It TURNED MY EAR BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Many recipes have a very ""flat"" taste.","Make sure that if you make the ""Focaccia"" bread recipe that you increase the salt from 1/4 tsp. to more like 1/2 to 1 tsp. Otherwise the bread will taste completely ""flat"" and in-edible. Ended up throwing out the whole bread.Probably a good cookbook for the very basic recipes, however, not very sophisticated or flavorable for the more advanced cook.Have the basic Betty Crocker cookbook from the 1970's, and keep referring back to that version for the more tradition recipes."
4,good for beginners and experienced cooks,"This is a great cook book for those just starting to cook and for those with experience. There are pictures of some dishes, which is a nice plus. It is also a good reference book for cooking. It lists possible problems cooks may have with dishes and then lists possible reasons. Good instructions."
2,Not exactly what I expected,I thought this was going to be the hardcover book and it was not. It was the binder version and it was not in that great of shape.
3,A good cookbook for beginners,"I am an 18 year old college student who until recently, has never cooked. This was the first cookbook that I bought. I think that the easy format make this cookbook ideal for beginners. The introductory sections for each chapter is a nice touch too. The problem with the cookbook is that the recipes are somewhat uninspired. Some of the dishes tasted like the dinners you get at Bob's Big Boy. If you already know cooking basics I would recommend skipping this one and buying a more sophisticated cookbook like Better Homes and Gardens. But if your a novice then Betty Crocker is definately worth the money."
5,"Love the book, disappointed in the ""spiral""","A must have in the kitchen! Everything from beef stew to snicker doodles to white sauce! I am, however, very disappointed that this comes in the ""spiral"" bound. If you notice on the front page description it does say ""hard cover"", but if you read the small print in the description, it does have some abbreviation indicating that it's spiral bound."
1,Don't do it!,"If bland uninspired food by a Corporate Giant (General Mills) pretending to be America's Sweetheart of the kitchen (sorry boys and girls, ther is no Betty Crocker, that's why she changes her face every 10 years) by all means, buy this book. Now if you want to really learn how to cook real food, try the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book or the Southern Living Cook Book. Both will lead you the beginer through all the steps and have you cooking like a pro in no time!"
5,Just what I was looking for.,"If you are just starting a business this is an awesome starter phone. I was reluctant to order this given i'd never heard of Aastra but after seeing some of the good prices compared to other similar phones, I decided to go with this one. So far I am very happy with my decision. Mechanically the phone works perfectly and sounds awesome. Setup is so quick compared to other phones I have looked at. Out of the box- setup is literally 10 minutes and you're connected! Speaker phone is pretty good. If you are on the border on whether to get this setup, I personally recommend it.Pros- Easy to use, simple/sleek design, easy redial, multiple lines and ring tones, conference calls, caller id, compactCons- doesn't look the best but some may love the simplicity that this phone providesIn brief, this little phone will not disappoint, it's the whole package in a compact phone."
4,4 CD Complete Kertesz Brahms budget box coming soon!,"Therefore you need not buy this item at inflated used prices. Box available in Europe now, probably here in USA late 2012. Excellent performances, as you know."
4,Brahms serenades,"Excellent production quality and a lovely interpretation of Brahms' two serenades - good value for great music. If you're a Brahms fan and haven't been introduced to what are considered his ""pre-symphonies,"" you're in for a delightful, upbeat experience. I like this version as much as any I've ever heard."
2,They leak and they stink! Buy the Gold instead...,I bought a 20 pack of the Silver Pads and used them for 5 nights straight and now I have the stinkiest feet ever. I absolutely can't get rid of the smell. They also leaked the brown gook in my bed. I'll go back to the Gold pads.
5,The Mystical Guide To Home Inspection,This book is of great need to everyone interested in buying or selling a home. It gave so much information and insight. I loved this book and will always refer to it. They would also make great gifts.I never looked at any house with this awareness. THANK YOU! It was fun and informative.
3,Good - but not their best,"I have been a fan of Jarabe de Palo for quite a few years now. While this album shows some stylistic experimentation, I think it comes up a bit short compared to ""Depende"" and ""La Flaca."" Still, they win points for taking risks, and as always, the lyrics are great."
2,Time for a creative reawakening.,"De vuelta y vuelta is my third album from Jarabe de Palo. The first one being ""La Flaca"" and the second one being ""Depende"". La flaca was off the charts, just phenomenal. Depende was good, but a weaker showing for Jarabe de Palo. This time with De vuelta y vuelta, the group sounds even less impressive than before. In all fairness to the group, there are some good moments in this album, but alas, they are short ones. Mama is perhaps the best song on the album, as for the rest of the songs the best thing they have going for them are Pau Dones' voice. Back to the drawing board for Jarabe de Palo, they are capable of doing better than this!"
4,easy cleanup,"These wipes are very strong and well moistened for easy cleanup. Only thing that would make them better is if they were flush-able. They are wonderful to have around for emergencies, for traveling, for times when you have water issues, or problems accessing a bath or shower."
4,This stuff is very good! It has a ...,"This stuff is very good! It has a pleasing scent and works very well when used in the microwave. It can be heated IN the bag and then used. This product is advertised as being for anyone who has difficulty getting out of bed, and can't get into the bathroom to be cleaned, but I found it works great for just freshening up. The cloths are very thick and soft, but there are only eight in a package. I would highly recommend this product."
3,I used the Comfort Bath Cleansing System on ...,"I used the Comfort Bath Cleansing System on my three-year-old daughter during a slight illness. I thought the scent was pleasant, but she didn't. It was convenient to have a prepared product for cleaning, but for the price I'd probably just do it the old-fashioned way. I'd probably recommend this product to anyone who required in-home health care, but in so far as just to have it hanging around the house -- no."
4,a fine scary yarn,"My kids and I all enjoyed reading this book. The characters are likable, the plot moves forward with action and is believable. The pacing is also well done. It reminded me of scary stories my friends might tell around the campfire. So if you want a well-written story that makes you want to turn the page to see how it all comes out, you found it! And currently $1.99 on Kindle is a fantastic deal."
3,A fun adventure,** Originally reviewed for Penwick Chronicles **This is another seventh son of a seventh son fantasy story. I did enjoy listening the reader Christoper Welch has a good voice. He was able to vary his voice enough for each character that I never had trouble knowing who was speaking. I especially loved the creepy voices of the witches. This book was a good adventure with some scary moments so I would not recommend this book for very young listeners. I would also not recommend eating while listening to this book. Some of the witches spells are a little gross. Overall I think this book suffered from first of a series syndrome. The world that Mr. Delaney builds is very complex and I'm still not sure of all of the duties of a Spook. I like this story enough that I will be checking out the sequel in the future.** I received a free copy of this audiobook from the YA SYNC program**
1,Great!!!,Was a good thriller with tons of suspense. Never knew what was going to happen. GREAT BOOK!!!! Can't wait to read the rest.
4,Solid book,Good book never got boring cant wait to get the second oneGood scare as well but not over the top
4,really good,JD don't desapoint me with this book. Looking forward to read the next book and see how the story evolves and get to its conclusion.
4,Ready for 2nd book,"Looking forward to next book in this series. This author has a great story line, looking to see how it plays out."
3,Hmm . . .,"Let me say that I enjoyed most parts of this book. It's a very good read and has unexpected turns around every corner, but there was a very disturbing part in it. Tom must take some cakes and feed them to a witch. He is not aloud to open the basket that they are in. Later on he discovers that the ""cakes"" were made out of a human baby. The witch ate the baby because she was a ""blood"" witch. It was very disgusting! I have a little brother and I was ready to puke about it. I would probably say no kids under 13 should read this book."
5,Scary!,"My husband and I read this book and we thought it was fantastic; however, I wouldn't recommend this for children under 13--it's just too scary. Also, a warning for anyone who is afraid of the dark or has nightmares...even I had a hard time going to sleep after reading the book."
2,I just couldn't get into the story,The basic premise was good but I just didn't like the story or the characters. I finished it but only just.
4,Great start to this series!,"I really enjoyed this book,Tom is the 7th son of a 7th son and has been apprenticed to the local ""Spook' he is the man who takes care of ghosts and witches and such.Although the Spook gives Tom just a few rules, of course Tom breaks a biggy and ends up releasing a very bad witch that the Spook had already taken care of.And so Tom's adventure begins.This is a good YA or even older Juvenile Fiction.If you are a fan of Harry Potter, Septimus Heap, or even The Ranger's Apprentice I really think you will like this book."
5,Great and exciting book,"I didn't know what to expect as I opened this book for the first time, a part me thought it would just be another bland young adult book but its so much more than that. The book has a naturally dark mood being that the protagonist, Tom Ward is learning to fight witches, ghosts, and boggarts. However this book strikes a perfect middle ground, making it a great read for any age group. The characters are also interesting, Tom Ward is the apprentice who must face his fears and control them, The Spook is a tough yet intelligent teacher, and Alice is a mischievous witch who takes a liking to Tom. Don't hesitate getting this if you've been looking for a fantasy series filled with adventure, and interesting characters."
5,Each chapter a gem.,"I can't get over how much I loved this book. I'm 35. I'm a teacher. I'm busy. I made time to read this book like you make time to eat. Two obsessive days. I carried the story with me when I was away from it.There's an anti-establishment edge to it that I love. It's earthy and pagan and scary. Every single chapter takes your breath away. I guarantee you won't be able to put your bookmark in the middle of a chapter. Man! This is well-crafted stuff.I read a lot. Of everything. This is the best thing I've read in a long time. Hands down.I confess: I borrowed the copy I just finished reading from the library. I'm writing this review five minutes after I purchased it today (we need to encourage Delaney's publisher to keep paying him). It's a book I'm going to share with my kids and friends (as long as they promise to give it back...)More, please, Mr. Delaney. (Write faster!)"
4,Revenge of the Witch,"It took me a little longer to get into this book, but now that I am finished I will be reading the sequel immediately."
3,A series of unfortunate events and witches,"I agree with other reviewers that the imagery here is too disturbing for younger readers. Yeah, Grimm's fairy tales are also disturbing, but they're morality tales from a less enlightened time intended to terrify youngsters into obedience. Scare a little is okay, but terrify? The images here are more Poe than ""The Graveyard Book."" The misogyny also seems anachronistic.Tom, the not quite twelve year old narrator, tells the story like a 5th grade book report. (This happened, and then this happened, and then this happened). Each event ends in an unlikely escape. The apprentice's world is very dark and, according to the Spook, getting darker. I see that this series has fourteen books, so it obviously has a devoted following and a lot of time to get very dark indeed. I just don't think I'd read them to my children."
3,The last apprentice Book #1,A little slow !! But I did read all up to book 5 . #4 was good but it ended there. This is a good stopping place. He should have also. Make up your on mine or save some money and skip this ONE!
5,Cute and full size,"This is cute with the leaves for the top. Very bright and colorful. It's a full size hamper so fits a week worth's of clothes. It's flexible and takes the typical abuse of a kid. It's very easy to move to the laundry room. If the kids miss tossing the clothes in and they hang on the edge, it can cause it to bend over but it bounces back well once the clothes are actually put in. But if that would drive you crazy, you won't like pop-up style hampers. It's a fun way to add decoration to a Dora-themed room and easy enough to replace when you want to change the room decor."
1,"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK, READ SOMETHING ELSE","I HAVE BEEN READING MANY PREHISTORIC NOVELS IN THE LAST YEAR ANDHAVE ENJOYED JUST ABOUT EVERY BOOK. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THATREALLY WASTED MY TIME. I SOMEHOW THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD GET BETTERAND THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME READING BUT WAS I EVER WRONG. THE CHARACTERS WERE HARD TO REALLY LIKE AND THE STORY LINEHAD NOTHING INTERESTING TO KEEP MY INTEREST. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME REALLY GOOD PREHISTORIC NOVELS TRY LINDA LAY SCHULER, CHARLOTTE PRENTISS, LYNN MCKEE OR JOAN WOLF. (I HAVE NOT READ JOAN WOLF'S BOOKS YET BUT HAVE HEARD EXCELLENT REVIEWS!!)"
4,Anthropology Lite,"This novel reads so fast it comes dangerously close to being considered light reading. However, it's author Björn Kurtén was a real-life anthropologist and he formed this ""paleofiction"" (as he called it) from his hypothesis of how the Neaderthals lost out to the Cro-Magnon. The result is fun -- with surprising ideas. And with a scientific grounding that can't be found in Jean Auel's works."
2,"Interesting anthropology, weak fiction","To be honest, this is a one-star novel, but I feel like I'm kicking a dog when I come down hard on this book, so I'll give an extra star for effort and risk-taking. The author is an accomplished scientist who wanted to play with some speculations in a novelistic format. The result is a novel that is not worth reading, much less buying: wooden, predictable, awkward, and generally bereft of the qualities that make good fiction good. You can read a couple of chapters from your library copy then skip to the afterword, where the author explains his scientific hypotheses. If you want to get a better sense of a more serious novelist trying to depict the neolithic, try William Golding's 'The Inheritors.' 'Clan of the Cave Bear' only for laughs."
5,This Album is right up there with Aquemini....A 1998 Classic,"Boots and Pam the Funkstress are back for their third Album, ""Steal This Album"" (Sans E-Roc, who guests on ""Breathing Apparatus""). Not only are the Coup in perfect political form on tracks like ""Repo Man Sings for You"" with Del the Funky Homosapien, and ""Busterismology"" for examples, but they are also kickin' mad funk. This album is musically crazy and lyrically tight, and truly the best Hip Hop album of the year, maybe second only to Outkast's ""Aquemini""."
3,Made in mexice!,"Nowhere as good as the old belts I have that were made by John Bianchi in the USA. Decent price, poor quality."
5,A great book about life and football,"For anyone who played the game and had it end way too early, or for anyone who ever had a crazy idea but was hesitant to act upon it, this is your book.Great writing, great stories, and great action. Cowser has a gift for storytelling and this book goes beyond the game played by men trying to re-capture their glories. It's about people doing what makes them happy and doing it to their best potential. Isn't that what life is all about anyway?"
1,neat idea weak book,The concept is interesting and I give the author credit for acting on a dream. But the book is dull and lacks hard hitting football information or character development.Author is also determined to discuss 9/11. Typical liberal professor stuff. I found it a little much. Maybe I have listened to one to many of those patriotic songs he dislikes.There is another book out on an individual who joins a semipro team that is better.
4,Great book for Aquatic Plants lover,"I don't think too much if I claim this book is the most comprehensive AQUATIC PLANTS book at the moment.After long waiting being translated, I feel satisfy when read carefully the book content.In another word I agree to say this as Aquatic Plants Encyclopedia for year 2000.YUP, It is not 100% perfect, but at least this book is enriching our information source to identify the plants,habitat,origin and other useful informations.Last, it a must have for everybody in planted aquaria hobby."
4,Nine Out Of Ten,"If you know this show, you know it is great. The original recording left much to be desired in record quality, which this album transcends. Raoul Julia was fabulous on the the original and Jonathon Price raises the bar with his version of ""Only With You"". The real shining star is Elaine Paige...she is heartbreaking on ""Unusual Way"" and reminds us why we love her. For a real treat go to track 12 and turn it up really loud. ""The Bells of St. Sebastian"" has never sounded so full and alarming. This concert recording is a must for any Nine,Yeston or Fellini fan. The Price is worth it!"
4,One of my favorites!,"I am a bit surprised at the negativity I see here, because this is one of my favorites! I will admit though that I have not heard any other cast recordings of Nine. I think Jonathan Pryce does a nice job, I get such an image in my head listening to him! I also love My Husband Makes Movies and Unusual Way! When I first got this CD, I wasn't crazy about it, but now I really love it! Maybe you just need to give it a chance!"
3,Jonathan Price can't sing up to par.,"Jonathan Price, who's talk-singy style worked perfectly for the Engineer in Miss Saigon, does not work for Guido Contini in NINE. The show centers around his character and the 21 women in his life (he gets around). But Raul Julia sings a far superior show to Price. Sorry, Jonathan. I still think you're a fantastic actor, but I recommend the original Broadway cast also featuring Karen Ackers as his wife. I give that cast an 8 out of 10. Also, the Australian cast is a 7. Check out the Broadway cast!"
3,WHY IS MY NAME NOT IN THE CREDITS!!!!!!!,"Hello. When i was nine i was in the London Production of this cast recording. In an recent trip to New York i found a copy of the cast recording, i bought it and ran home to listen to it. Yes it was the same production. Yes i know the lyrics backwards. Yes the production on CD does not sound particularly exciting but visualy it was amazing (we had a 15 min standing ovasion). However my excitement was turned to horror when i found i was not in the credits list! For me that is the only downfall of the soundtrack. It amuses me to read the other reviews criticising the English about how we let this production down - all the money that was raised went to an Aids Charity and to me that is the most important thing. I was not payed a penny and we were all their just so that we could raise money for a worthy cause!"
3,"It does an OK job of conditioning, but ...","It does an OK job of conditioning, but it's more of a cream-rinse type thing, if you ask me. No noticeable difference was noted while using this product as far as manageability or shine are concerned. It has a nice smell and, on the positive side, doesn't seem to weigh my hair down. But when choosing a conditioner, higher-priced name-brand stuff may not work any better."
1,misleading product description,This product labeled as a 4x dvd-r is incorrectly labeled. I ordered it and returned it twice because Amazon sent me the 8x dvd-r. If they don't have a 4x in stock they should NEVER substitute with another format. These do NOT work in all DVD burners. Very inconvenient and a waste of time waiting for the item
5,mistitled color,What I received in my purple order is really more a magenta color! Otherwise beautiful cosmix spinner.
1,"""There are grades of vanity, there are only grades of ability in concealing it.""","The concept of this book is not necessarily bad because looking back on your adolescent attempts at writing can be amusing, in a cringe-inducing way, but I don't understand what Ariano was trying to achieve by making this available to the public. It isn't funny to anyone who doesn't actually know the author and it just seems like a pointless exercise in self-aggrandisement.Vanity publishing has that name for a reason."
1,Smug and tiresome,"If cringe-inducing teen prose is what you're in the mood for, I suggest pulling your old diaries out of storage. Tara Ariano's bad teen writing and present-day asides are no more interesting, clever or funny than yours. A pointless vanity piece that offers no insight or relevance within its understandably self-published pages."
1,A waste of time,"As if the book wasn't self-indulgent enough, she put a picture of her junior-high self on the COVER. It's just not nearly as funny as the writer thinks it is.Don't buy this when you can read much better journals and teen memoirs on the web for free."
5,"Boys, take your vitamins!","I am so excited that Bad Teen Novel is available for purchase! I can no longer wait for the installments on [website], I must have it now, in my hot little hands. I'm getting one for my sister too! This delightful novel delves deep into the mind of ""teenage girl"". Relive your horrible taste, ignorance and lame priorities. Not to mention utter obsession with sex!!!"
3,Mildly Entertaining... How Did It Get Published?,This book was funny at times... just for it's purely strange diction by a 13 year old girl... I still don't know how it got published and question why I bought it... It was a fast read with little to reflect on or think about.
1,At least the title is honest,"I think that the title of the book implies that the writer thinks she's funny for being *brave* enough to foist her poorly written teen fiction on the world as an adult. But it's just bad. If you want to read bad fiction, surf the net for free. Plus the price of this book is far too inflated for a paperback trash novel. What book did the rest of these glowing reviewers read?"
1,TERRIBLE,"Ugh, this was awful - so not funny. It was such a waste of time. burbuly boo, burbuly boo, zim zam wammy jam woo woo woo burbuly boo, burbuly boo, splippity splappity sploo sploo sploo. I just found this book to be mess. I think we've all written something terrible when we were teens, but this is the sort of thing you should keep hidden in a closet somewhere. zing zang beeble bibble bop! It didn't take long for the joke to wear thin. sneeble, snarble, snooble, snoo. Bleeble, blarble, blooble, bloo."
1,"""A Bad Deal""","Not the quality the book was supposed to be. Seems to have been ""dried out"" after 30 pages or so had gotten wet.Cover damaged--did not match description."
4,Incredibly accurate and scholarly work,"A must read, even if only for the sections on the little known phyla of aminals. Although released before the advent of the super-realistic photographs we are priviledged to enjoy today, the ink drawings are quite informative and the text is as near-perfect as could be done. A true classic on the subject."
5,MEMORIES,Totally as I remember it. Brought back so many memories. LOVED IT. GABBA GABBA HEY!!!!! shelly
4,A classic!,"This movie is such a classic....if you are a lover of the Ramones then you have to see this ridiculous yet entertaining movie. It's hysterical, especially if you are a fan of late 70's, early 80's movies. A must for your dvd collection."
2,This movie brings back memories!,I am 46 years old and love this movie! Much of it reminds me of when I was in high school. And I have always loved the Ramones. Joey's death was traumatic and the movie means all the more to me now that he is gone. The kids in this movie do what many of us have always dreamed of doing-getting rid of the school and getting the better of the principal. All of us at one time or another have had a Miss Togar to deal with in school. This is a fun movie. Best part?? The paper airplane. And the music. The soundtrack is the best!
2,Not as good as I remember,I absolutely loved this movie when I was younger. I guess tastes change as you get older. lol
4,"Joey and DeeDee, we miss you!!","While lacking in the plot department, anyone who appreciates good music must own this. If you are a Ramones fan like me (and now my wife), you probably already do.Avoid the Corey Feldman sequel as if your sanity depends on it (it does)."
4,cult classic for punk lovers,"This movie is a must have for anyone who knows all the words to ""I wanna be sedated"". It's hilarious. 'Nuff said."
2,Great Movie - terrible sound!,"I love this movie. This is a great movie. However, the sound transfer on this DVD edition is terrible. It distorts horribly in any scene where the music gets even moderately loud and there is even an undercurrent of hiss and distortion in the strictly dialogue scenes. I have seen other reviews stating the same thing so I know it is not just my system. It is bad enough they probably should be recalled. In lieu of that happening I guess I am stuck with this version if I want a copy of one of my favorites. What a crying shame that Roger Corman couldn't see that it was done properly."
2,Not the classic I was expecting,"The Ramones are one of my favorite bands, and I'm a big fan of B Movies, but man, did I dislike this film. There are some reasons to watch this film, such as the music, the terrible acting by The Ramones, and P.J. Soles. Other than that, the film is worthless. There are fewer things worse than bad comedy, and that's what this film is. Just because something is meant to be cheesy doesn't automatically make it entertaining. Many of the jokes in this film fall flat, and I just couldn't get into it. I kept wanting The Ramones to come back on and do some songs. Anyhow, every fan should watch this and judge for themselves, given it's cult status."
2,A real stinker.,Not the best movie I've ever seen. Too much violence for a movie that is suppose to be fun and about teenagers. A real stinker in my opinion. Basically I just wanted it for the beginning song that was written & performed by Paul McCartney. The Ramones didn't do much for me either.
1,"Save your money and buy ""Raw"" instead!","I saw this movie and let me tell you.It sucked!The main character is so annoying!She has no life.The whole plot is dumb!Napoleon Dynamite has more of a plot than this!The only good thing about this was that the Ramones played live.Other than that....yuk!And Im so sure that the Ramones are gonna help trash a high school!Im actually surprised that the Ramones would stoop this low!I mean I love em, but after seeing this, I don't like em much anymore.Honestly your better off buying ""Hey is Dee Dee home?,"" ""Raw"" or ""End of the Century""."
5,Hysterical movie starring one of the greatest bands to set foot on a stage,"This movie is a comedy with New York's own Ramones. All kinds of hijinks break out at school. Many funny lines and of course, the rock beat of the main attraction. It's not exactly known for a complicated plot, but it's fun and it'll bring up your day. Snag the DVD for the 30th anniversary and put some life in your movie collection. :)"
4,Rock and roll high school,I bought this movie for my 36 year old daughter and she just loved it. It had been a long time since she had seen it and this edition had extras that added to her viewing experience.
4,It's really a language!,"I have heard that sign language is a real language so many times, but this book A Man Without Words really got the message across to me. The passion of the writer, and her close knowledge of people who have not had the opportunity to learn any language as well as her enormous knowledge and expertise made this a fascinating read. We really do need language, common language that others can understand, so we can think logically, and share our ideas instead of beign imprisoned in solitary confinement. Very touching. Very real. Very infomative. I am an Early Childhood writer and presenter,I will take Susan's message to many people."
5,Wonderful.,"This book was inspirational, educational and very eye-opening. I highly recommend it to anyone, and I will go beyond that to say that I think everyone should read it."
4,Works Great,"I dont know what the other reviewers are talking about, but this charger charged my Crazr for 2 years, and it never messed up the phone. It works great."
4,Much better than Volume 1,This book is a much better read than Volume 1 ot the series. Griffin is getting better at exploring the evil that men do for good causes. The depiction of WW II England and the politics of the Free French forces were fascinating. I'll look forward to his next book.
4,Loved it,I really enjoy Griffin's books. They are fast paced and fun. Have read just about everything he has written - then I found this newer series!
5,Please continue the Corps series,Have read all of all Griffin's books. Great author. Looking forward to the continuation of the Corps series.
3,Not his best book.,"This is not the best book W.E.B. Griffin has written but if you want to continue reading the exploits of James Whittaker and Dick Canidy from Honor Bound, Blood and Honor and The Last Heroes it would be a worthwhile read."
4,"Get it, read it and wait for the next in the series.","Classic Griffin. If you've read the other two series, you can expect what the book is like. Regardless, I didn't put it down once I started reading it.This book gets into the development of the OSS and does not pay as much attention to the military as did many of his other books. All the characters return from the first book and there are some interesting developments. Griffin also gets deeper into the characters and how they relate to one another. The book is mostly cloak-and-dagger OSS stuff with a few other plot developments thrown in. Not much shooting or violence, but there is a lot of drinking, money and sex -- as is common in many of his books."
1,The problem isn't that it's noisy,"I felt suckered by having bought this disc and having succumbed the relentless marketing hype surrounding it. All I can say is, don't. You might be misled into believing that this opera will endure, but only if you are overly impressed by 1) the composer's youth; 2) his technical skill at imitating various pop-song formats in an orchestral setting; and 3) his grasp of form and structure that indubtedly earned him high marks back in his conservatory days.I have no problem with the fact that the opera is noisy; heck, I love noisy music! My problem is that it's so bloodless. The only thing that makes this opera notable is that it's one of the grandest, most astonishingly protracted public cases of self-love I have ever had the misfortune to witness, and if you're tempted to join in with him, do so at your peril."
1,THIS IS NOT MUSIC!,"This is hands down the worst opera I have EVER heard, and that's the biggest understatement of the soon to be past millenium.There is no melody what so ever- NOTHING! Ades couldn't even provide his listeners with ONE GOOD TUNE! The only thing I got out of this opera was a huge MIGRANE!First Glass and Adams- now this - it's 1,000 times worse. At least Glass and Adams provide an occassional melody. Ades delivers nothing...it's totally grating....I WILL NEVER LISTEN TO THIS AGAIN!I could have bought my fifth recording of Mozart's, The Marriage of Figaro....but I wanted something new...If this is the direction opera is taking then I will NEVER listen to a modern one again...If you want a great new recording get Kalman's DIE HERZOGIN VON CHICAGO....it's utterly amazing. It's not new but was not heard of after it's hugely successful Vienna premiere because it was supressed under the Third Reich."
1,Skip this one,"Some new lyrics, some new orchestrations. Not much new in this recording. A few irritating performances. Many better recordings to choose from."
1,Battery Did Not Work W/My Sony Camcorder,"I purchased this battery for my Sony camcorder. I tried to charge it but was not able to. Therefore, I returned it and purchased a battery directly from Sony. I do not recommend this battery to anyone who has a Sony camcorder."
2,Camcorder Battery Review,So far so good. A little late when I paid for express shipping. Didn't get here in time to record my grand-daughters final baseball game.Stars- 4
1,A Waste of Money,"I was so upset, a absolute waste of money. Extremely uncreative lessons a kindergardener could come up with. The slides are O.K. but not worth $60. And there are very few (maybe 5) handouts. Awful!!! It is also an unreturnable item (which I was unaware of before I purchased it). Hume's book of lists I found extremely helpful but what was she thinking with this one."
1,The good reviews must come from friends or sellers,"I've been teaching art for two years and am always ready for ideas and supports. This was a waste of my money in that the projects were presented as ideas without lesson plans. Also, they were dated projects; I have art texts from 1960 with the same projects. It provides no samples, and certainly nothing is in color. I'm surprised this book had any positive reviews. Therefore, I think that these reviews are done by people who a) are family/friends of the author or b) are book sellers that are trying to get rid of it."
3,"Overall, I enjoyed using the Neutrogena hair conditioner. ...","Overall, I enjoyed using the Neutrogena hair conditioner. It smelled great and I was eager to use because it was made by Neutrogena. After washing my hair with shampoo, I applied the conditioner. It was very creamy -- almost like lotion for my hair. It did take a little work to get it to rinse out of my hair, but when I finally got it all out, my hair felt great. It had a nice shine and great body."
4,As good a conditioner as I've used. Compares ...,As good a conditioner as I've used. Compares well to Redken All Soft and Extreme conditioners. Would buy and continue to use.
3,I liked the product. I had just gotten ...,"I liked the product. I had just gotten the last of a perm cut off. My hair was dry, and since I color my hair, it did need a conditioner. Always when I use a conditioner, it leaves my hair a little limp, because I have very fine hair. I'd recommend the product."
3,Not as it appears.,"There was no description of the product, only a picture. Which is misleading, does not clip in to seat belt, Loop into strap. I was searching for an extender that clipped/inserted into the clip for belt, Not looped into straps, could have purchased locally without high shipping costs.Product works, timely receipt. Would recommend posting how the product works rather than a misleading photo."
2,I Don't Share the Others' View of this Work!,"This book read like a bunch of loosely connected letters that did not keep my attention for very long. If it were not for the fact that I do not start a book and not read the whole thing, I would have not read the rest of this book past Chapter 3. There are many better wrtitten books that are concerned with the state of our oceans, so research another and don't waste your time."
3,Interesting Interpretation,"Very interesting production of a great classic. I have no idea what the other person objected to the material as being offensive, they obviously never heard this production or read the source material. Even though Sondheim had some input into this production it's amazing to hear some close similarities to Into the Woods. The misses on this recording are the vocals which aren't very strong and the fake accents are cringe worthy. Having said that this 2 cd set does include most of, if not all, the dialogue. Also, if you love that kitschy 70s harpsichord sound you'll love this recording!"
5,The ONLY Candide,"This is, bar none, my favorite recording of ""Candide."" It may be because I saw the production when I was mere lad, but even listening to it today,I think it captures the humor that the more musically polished productions miss."
5,Great set,"This is a classic performance. In fact, I don't think it has many serious contenders in the catalogue. The main characters are excellent. Gabriela Benackova as Marenka gives a splendidly warm characterization and the slightly sharp sounds when she is singing at the top end of the spectrum is no more than a quibble; none at all about Peter Dvorsky as Jenik or Miroslav Kopp as Vasek.In fact, there are no serious objections to anything on this set. Kosler gives an eminently energetic and vigorous performance (the famous orchestral sections, for instance, are marvelous), and the rest of the cast doesn't really have one weak link.Sound quality is perhaps not faultless (it is a little clangy in a way which might lead you to believe that the recording is a little older than it actually is), but nothing to complain seriously about. Strongly recommended."
5,Tex Ritter at his best,"VCI Entertainment gives us a fine DVD release of four of the better and more representative little B Westerns that the legendary Tex Ritter made in the 1930s and 1940s. As usual, VCI has found good prints for its release. At the very reasonable price for these four movies, no one should be disappointed. Two of Ritter's Universal-released oaters are included, as are two earlier vehicles. No one with an interest in classic B Westerns should be disappointed. Ritter, of course, includes several musical numbers in each production; after all, he had one of the finest voices around. But these little films are not musicals, but rough-and-ready shoot-'em ups, bound to please the most discriminating Western fan.Recommended."
3,Can't keep a good man down,"Although mildly boring to begin with, the movie ends with an impressive storm-sequence, where a whole town is blowing hither and thither around a baffled Buster Keaton, giving him a chance to demonstrate his gymnastic virtuosity, making up for an othervise tiring experience. Marion Byron is sweet as the Julia of the unpopular romance. Far better than the overrated The General."
2,"Alright, but nothing to write home about.","This film is dull, and the comedy is pointless, but it is not the worst that was ever made. This film has the famous sceen, where the house falls on Keaton."
5,Nice Atlas!,I've purchased many different atlases for my primary students. This is a particularly great one.
3,Good Movie - Poor Video Quality - Material Copied from VHS,The material is not a DVD quality but VHS quality (written on a DVD).Good movie however.
2,MAXX-imum Depression,"If there was one man who set music back 40-odd years it was Terry 'Tezza' Maxx. If there were two men, it would be the aforementioned and Funkstar DeLuxe. If it were three, the two previously mentioned and Lee from Steps. The point of this is that this 'single' is a clear rip-off of Meat Loaf's 'Bat Out Of Hell' albeit with more synth. Maxx's vocals are a far cry from those which he employed on his chart topping debut single 'Maxx's Partee' and Funkstar couldn't hit a dj's turntable with a barn door.Not even the 30 second lute solo could save this abomination of a track.A big phat thumbs down."
4,"Wise, amusing short poems","Grooks are short poems, often humorous and sometimes politically correct, but mostly entertaining and accompanied by amusing illustrations"
3,Has to be an easier to use florida lawn book.,"There is no index. This makes it frustrating to use. For example, if you want information on chinch bugs, you have to go to the table of contents and locate Pest Management on page 103, then leaf through until you find chinch bugs on page 123. However,once you find what you want, the information is helpful."
2,OK; Not Great,Book presents facts/opinions with little helpful explanation. Divides content according to some arbitrary unknown rule. Photos are small and hard to distinguish plant characteristics and details
1,poorly developed characters,"The hardcover copy of this book is beautifully produced. Sadly, the content leaves a lot to be desired. The introduction is gripping but the effect soon fades away. The characters are poorly fleshed out. It takes about about two hundred pages to receive a bit of background information on the three female protagonists. The plot moves along very slowly. No even a tiny pinch of humor is added in to make us care about these one dimensional characters. The dialogue is stilted and full of cliches. This is one of the worst romance novels I have read in a long time and gives the genre a bad name."
5,Loved this series!,"I absolutely loved the Clayborne series. I just finished Come the Spring, and as always, Garwood kept me intrigued from start to finish. I never want to put her books down and find myself sneaking at work to catch a quick chapter at my desk!! Come the Spring had excellent twists and I loved the chemistry between Cole and Jessica/Grace and Daniel. The scenes with Cole and Caleb were especially endearing to me, being a single mother. Garwood appeals to the romantic in me every time! This was no exception. This is a must read, especially if you have read the four other Calyborne novels. It brings everything full circle!"
3,"Good, but missing something","While I'm not a huge Western romance fan, I could see that Come the Spring has merit. Most of the characters, the men at least, seemed quite real and likeable, even amusing at times. But the women felt lacking, which seems strange since they were crafted by a woman, but that's the way they came across. I enjoyed reading about Cole, especially his interaction with the baby, Caleb, but didn't cheer with him over his pick of women.I don't know, but I think I will try reading another of Garwood's books. Though her dialogue could use improvement, she has a lot of talent and it's obvious why she's so popular. I just didn't feel this book was everything it could have been."
3,ANYBODY BADMOUTHING THE CLAYBOURNE BRIDE SERIES LISTEN UP:,"The first time I read the Claybourne Bride Series, I fell in love with it. They were terrific, and Julie, if you would happen to be reading this, I think should do more stories like this! And anyone who says any different than that can put it where the sun don't shine. They were great. I have to say that Cole was my favorite, too, and I do feel that Come the Spring should have been more about him rather than that Daniel Ryan guy, I absolutely love Cole. Julie, you did good!"
1,NO MORE ROSES,"MY SISTER AND I HAVE READ EVERY BOOK YOU HAVE PUBLISHED. ACTUALLY WE HAVE READ THEM ALL SEVERAL TIMES. WE ARE DEVOTED FANS AND ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO ANY NEW BOOKS OUT. THE ROSES SAGA WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME', FROM BEGINING TO END. YOUR MAGIC TOUCH WAS ABSENT. PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR EARLIER STYLE OF WRITING. THEY WERE TO DIE FOR. STILL YOUR DEVOTED FANS."
2,"Disappointing, especially following all the hype...","surrounding the series. Loved ""For the Roses"" -- good character development, and all that I have come to expect from Julie. However, the three small rose books were too short for any form of development at all, leaving the reader yearning for more, and wondering where the things they love about Julie have disappeared to."
2,It was okay...it occupied my time,I've read and reread every book Julie Garwood has written but was disappointed in this book (actually the whole series of the Claybournes). There isn't anything in this series that makes me want to reread for enjoyment (or recommend to my friends).
3,Not her best but still a good read.,"I have read every book of Julie Garwood. This most definitely was not her best. It had it's moments but not as intense as some of the other books Ms Garwood has written. I wish she could have spent more time on it. There were still some questions to be answered about some of the characters, which she didn't even touch upon but for a scant sentence or two."
2,Yawn,"I've read the first four books in this series, and even the short Pink, White, and Red books were better than this story. I'll even admit the unthinkable: I didn't finish the book. Around page 210, I found that I was totally disinterested in the characters (which as several people have mentioned is quite a number) and frankly didn't even care if the robbers were brought to justice. The plot was thin, the characters one-dimensional at best, and the writing ho-hum. I could have waited longer for an appropriate ending to the Clayborne saga."
3,FOR THE ROSES huge disappointment; no homecoming of Mama.,"I dearly love all of Julie Garwood's books. I'd be hardpressed to say which was my favorite, but I think ""For The Roses"" is pretty close and was so disappointed in the final story ""Come the Spring"". I so looked forward to reading about Mama coming home and a touching scene with all the family. I actually felt cheated."
3,"Good, but I expected more.","The story itself moved fairly quickly, however, I was vastly disappointed with Ms. Garwood's lack of character development. When the heroine was introduced I asked myself, ""Is she the one? Is this all there is?"" Furthermore, the character of Cole Clayborne was less developed in the book starring him than in For the Roses, where he was only a minor character. I didn't feel as if I was as familiar with the characters as I could've been. And that distance left me reacting somewhat coldly toward the characters and their respective plights. I didn't consider this book a waste of my time but I would not classify it as one of Ms. Garwood's best."
2,"Disappointing. Too many characters, not enough romance.","This book lost my interest during the first four chapters, when I realized that Garwood wasn't going to settle on a single hero and heroine. Not only that, but the women in the story lack any charm but beauty, and lack the strength and humor of Garwood's usual heroines. Anyone who reads mysteries will see the plot twists coming a mile away. And if you read romances for the development of characters and relationships, you will be disappointed."
2,This read was not as gripping as The Wedding.,Judy has failed in this book to keep the readers interest from not only the first chapter but for most of the book. The book was boring and heavy going in parts and lacked her usual sense of humor.
2,"Julie Garwood, Go Back to the Middle Ages!","I am a great fan of Ms. Garwood. But the Claybourne series of books is dismal and formulaic. My favorites by Garwood are The Bride and, as a matter of fact, all of her historical novels put in the Medieval period! I would hope that Ms. Garwood would soon go back to the Middle Ages, her first and best source of inspiration!"
5,I LOVED IT!!!,"What a great book! I totally fell in love with Cole and Ryan. I admired the bravery and spirit displayed by Rebecca and Grace. Talk about matches made in heaven! As usual, Garwood provides us with another heart-stopping book. It gave me a glimpse of the Clayborne family. I recently purchased the CLAYBORNE BRIDES. I'll soon get to know the rest of the Claybornes. If you like action, gorgeous hunky clever men, and strong women, this book is for you. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,Excellent,"After reading the entire ""for the roses"" Series, I was very pleased with the ending. I am sorry that the brothers and both roses will not be apart of my reading life anymore. My only critisism is Come the Spring was a little too much mystery and not enough ""summary"". I did like the twist at the end."
5,Enjoyable,I read For the Roses and I absolutely loved it. It wasn't disappointed at all by Come the Spring. It is a continuing saga of the Clayborne family. It centers on Cole Clayborne the gunslinger son. It was a powerful story I would definitely recommend it.
2,One of Garwood's Least Interesting,This book had too many characters and the plot was too convoluted to even resemble reality. The question as to why each of the women covered for the other regarding the robbery was vague. I expected more from a Julie Garwood book.
3,OK...I guess,"I absolutley loved ""For the Roses"" so I was looking forward to reading ""Come the Spring."" All I have to say is tht is was just OK. It was good, but it could still use a little improvement. I still suggest reading ""Come the Spring."" It was a good book. But Julie Garwood did better in ""The Bride"" and ""For the Roses."" I suggest reading those most certainly."
3,Did Julie Garwood really write this one?,I was introduced to Romance novels with Julie Garwood and I have loved all her books. I have read them all three times at least. I adored For the Roses and the three little books as well but I was very disappointed in Come the spring. It seemed to me that someone finished this series for Julie because it was not her writing. And I thought right along Cole would wind up with Eleanor. It just couldn't be Julie.
2,A big let down,Since her first book I have been a loyal fan of Garwood. However the entire Clayborne collection was shallow and empty. I read them looking for some of her old fire but mostly the series fizzled. The series just retold the same senario for each romance only using different characters
3,Kind of a disappointing end to the Roses.,"It wasn't a really bad book, it just wasn't very memorable either. I really enjoyed ""For the Roses"" and I even got a kick out of the Red, White and Pink novels. BUT this was a disappointing conclusion to the rest of the series and it was a very disappointing take on Cole's story. (Personally, Cole was one of my favourites and there was so much more that could have been done for him.)Where were all of the other brothers? Where were Mama and Mary Rose? Daniel was all right, but if you ask me, he should have been left out of the story, and his pages should have been devoted to the rest of the Clayborne clan.If you're a big fan of Garwood and the Roses series, read it. If not, pick up one of her other novels instead. You'll enjoy it more."
1,Needs help!,"I do not feel that the Claybourne series of books were good examples of the excellent writing that Julie Garwood does. I have read every book she has written and wait expectantly for the next one to come to the book stores. The White, Red and Pink Rose series and this book lacked the element that exists in all of her other books. What I am waiting for is another book like The Wedding, or The Bride. Maybe to find out what happens to Faith and Quinlan. Those are the type of books that I don't even mind rereading once in a while."
4,I like all Julie Garwood!'s book,I like all of Julie's books and this one was no different. Fast read action packed. It was the last book of the series wish there were more.

5,Great CD!,"This collection of Nocturnes is immensely enjoyable to listen to. The Nocturnes are by composers from different periods, but they complement each other and form a cohesive collection of pieces. The common thread that flows throughout the pieces is a dream-like state, and Dimiter Terziev's performance is superb!"
2,First dance video ever purchased,This is the first dance video I have ever purchased. I don't think enough emphasis is put on learning the steps first. They need a beginners section to teach the steps first.I will not give up on this video and hopefully will catch on soon. By all means I do not have two left feet.
3,difficult to follow,"I am used to dance videos with more detailed instructions, this is going too fast for me in intro to dances."
3,boring,"This dvd is fine, it just isn't very challenging. Other than learning the new steps - there is nothing challenging about it.......maybe I am just farther along in my progress than I thought......."
2,"Mostly dance, not much exercise","Of the 3 Prevention Dance DVDs this one was the most lacking. While the Dance moves were pretty cool the instructor needed to break a huge portion of the moves down taking the pace to 1/2 time. You just don't get any aerobic effect at this pace. I suspect if you are an experienced dancer you could watch the DVD a few times and then use it by just repeating the Dance segment ending where they do the dance to tempo a couple times to get your 20 minutes of Cardio.Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!does much simpler steps, more like steps you might do at a dance club, but has no 1/2 tempo moves so is more like a fitness video.Prevention Fitness Systems - Dance Yourself Thinis also a good one, and while has a few spots of 1/2 tempo keeps moving enough to give you a work out."
2,Drop it with dance,"Of all the Prevention Fitness DVD's I have this oneis for me complicated to learn and follow.I find that I am shown much too quickly (twice)how to dothe moves and soon are asked to follow in a quick paceand since its mirrored I have a hard time""getting"" some of the moves and although I try this videoagain and again I can't really follow them all which is frustrating.Some of the dances in this dvd are easy to follow.All in all I do not use it too often because of that.Prevention Fitness Systems - Drop It with Dance"
3,Not Quite Sure,"The jury's still out on this video for me. I watched it through before I actually tried following it, but had a terrible time keeping up. I usually pick up a routine quickly, but this was hard for me to follow. The steps are a little complicated, so my guess is that I'll have to try it again and again and again before I can even get through the routine without messing up (I like to keep up!). I think if you can get the routine down pat it's probably a fun workout, but I haven't had time to learn it. Each time I try it, I end up taking it out and putting in one of my older, easier to follow videos!"
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of the Prevention DVD workout series. However, I was very disappointed in my latest purchase. I have not managed to get my heart rate where it needs to be with this workout. The instruction (especially the cuing) provided by Tabitha D'umo is severly lackly and I agree with another reviewer that not enough camera time is spent following the dancers lower bodies to enable you to get the choreography down. If you are looking for a decent dance workout I recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slim Down....better instructor, more efficient time effective workout. Don't waste your money on Drop it with Dance."
4,fun cardio dance workout,"Prevention always delivers a fun and exciting workout. However, I wasn't as challenged with this routine like I am with others. The video is broken down into four 10 minute segments with a warmup and cool down. The last section called showtime was the most fun and the one I really felt challenged by. The instruction is good and the moves are fairly easy, but the delay between sections leaves you hanging for a few seconds. I will keep doing this video and continue to look for new titles by prevention. As for danciness, this one hits the spot in fresh and fun moves."
3,old fashioned western,i love the old fashion westerns mainly for the entertainment value. this purchase lived up uo to that. pleased to see tex ritter and robert mitchum in the last movie. i believe i got it for a 'song'. recommend it to other die hard old western fans. ken
4,Lone Star Trail is the best,"Of the four movies in this collection, Lone Star Trail is the best.The plot for Lone Star Trail is a fairly standard one. Rancher Blaze Barker returns to the town of Dead Falls to clear his name after spending two years in prison for a robbery he didn't commit. The actual robbers do what they can to either send him back to prison or to kill him. Comic relief is provided by veteran actor and sidekick Fuzzy Knight.Of particular interest in this film is that one of the ""bad guys"" is played by a future Hollywood legend very early in his career. Even if you don't like westerns, it would be fun to watch the first few minutes of the film to see if you can identify him."
1,An example of historical determinism,"Cohen pays all too little attention to Kosovo in this treatment of Milosevic-era Serbia, downplays popular culture (in spite of his professions to the contrary), and urges that the reader accept a version of historical determinism in which the actions of Serbs are seen as determined by the Ottoman occupation which ended in the nineteenth century. Cohen shows himself to have been sympathetic to the Serbian nationalist-expansionist project even while expressing a veiled contempt for Serbs. If one wants to understand Milosevic or, for that matter, Serbia in the Milosevic era, one would do a lot better to turn to the splendid treatments by Louis Sell or Adam LeBor."
4,If you are Lost in Arguements this is one you have to read,"This book is very basic. But it has great ideas that are needed for any kind of arguement. Even a novice can put use of these skills very effectively. This book is good for practical purpose, and if you get lost while arguing this is a must read book. Personally I learned a lot of things from this book. It is also very organised and you will go through the whole book without feeling clobbered in your head. There are people out there who will change the subject when you are talking about some issues, and if you are not aware of it you feel that you had lost the Argument. This is a basic trap you get into while arguing. The author explains exactly what to look for while arguing. It is a good book."
2,ladies pendant,"looked better in the picture, was not overly impressed. could not give it as a present as i intended."
2,Returned Item,"This product was returned as it was not what I expected, and didn't do what I originally thought it would do. It was my fault as I didn't specify my computer model #."
2,Just OK,"***Edit***Flipped my kayak over while the whistle was attached to the shock cording in front of the cowl to dump out the water. The whistle must have hit a rock, because it split in three pieces. I would expect a safety whistle to be a bit more durable. Lowering the rating to two stars.*********Not a bad whistle for the price. Not as loud as I was hoping, and it's extremely difficult to vary the volume with your air flow. I keep this clipped to my PFD when kayaking, and I was hoping to give short signaling chirps to the other boats. It's pretty much all or nothing, and all isn't all that loud."
4,Loud sound from a tiny package,"I actually purchased this whistle to use at our school's field day. I wanted something cheap that had a great sound, and let me tell you - it was LOUD! Everytime I used it, I felt like I was going to blast my ear drums out. So for security purposes I think this would work well. However, as another reviewer remarked, I would have like to been able to adjust the volume on the whistle more."
5,Great whistle,Purchased as part of the earthquake emergency pack I was assembling. Great whistle. Produced loud sound without much effort. Hook at the end was perfect for clipping on to the backpack that held all the emergency supplies.
4,Nice!,"I bought this whistle for my coach. It does not come with a string for the neck but it is a high quality whistle. Unexpectedly for me though it does not have a ball in it for blowing, it just creates a high pitched whistle when blown. This whistle is nothing to complain about."
4,Corruption and unrest in 1964 Los Angeles,"This is the first book I've read in the ""Easy Rawlins"" series of detective novels. I heard Mosely speak once in a panel discussion of the legacy of Raymond Chandler, and since then I've been looking for an opportunity to read his stuff. Chandler wrote novels about corruption, about institutions that you expect to be stalwart and only gradually find out are corrupt to the core. In Mosely's books, the corruption is taken for granted up front. This is a book about relationships, about the ad-hoc institutions and problem-solving methods people put together by themselves when they KNOW the legitimate system is crooked. Easy Rawlins isn't a paid detective; he's a problem-solver doing a favor for a friend. This puts a fresh new face on the detective genre. I've never read the first Rawlins book, Devil in a Blue Dress, but I think that I'll be looking for a copy soon."
2,Lazy day reading,"Walter Mosley is a patient man - he builds his plot slowly, as slowly as his protagonist gets to find bits and pieces of information pertaining to his quest. In the process, the reader gets glimpses of the life of blacks in the 50s as an uninvolved bypasser would - no passion but plenty of color, detail and objectivity.Unfortunately the plot never quite thickens enough. There are no real good or bad guys here and blame is shared broadly enough to make it a real - if somewhat uninteresting - story.Pleasant reading but definitely not grasping or exciting."
2,Not he Best Murder Mystery Detective Story,"... Mosley decides to write more about aethetics than about he actual mystery...I felt that the book was very very slow and very particular to details about items that looking back are all too unimportant. The Lt, the plain clothes cops etc, the phoen calls from no where. Boring and drawn out ... No excitement in this sleuths life..."
3,not one I would race to the store for,After reading the rest of the reviews I was like did I just read the same book as all these people? This book wasn't as fast paced as the others would have you believe - or atleast I didn't think so. This book was ok and that's the best way to explain it - not something I would rush out to read - but not something that you regret wasting your time with either - the storyline about a man helping out his friend and through that dealing with his own feelings of guilt and grief were different approach to a mystery but it just wasn't heart stopping - hands sweating good read.
3,Easy is becoming Bourgeois,"""Bad Boy"" is a traditional Easy Rawlins mystery, taking place in the 60's. Frankly, I liked the earlier Rawlin's books cuz the character had more energy and had a more licentious life-style. Easy's realization that Chesterfield's were killing him and he should stop smoking (despite their therapeutic effects after tight situations) is interesting, but reminds me too much of my own whitebread life."
4,Past mindsets,"Mosley with his precise, economical writing gives us a glimpse into the thoughts of a people we probably never knew. Always interesting, we solve a puzzle as Easy works his way, one person at a time, to the solution. Well done."
3,"Love WM, but this one didn't do it for me.","It took me forever to get through this book. The only reason I stuck with it was because of the author's track record. IMO, without Mouse, there was nothing that set this book apart from any average read. There were too many characters, and I didn't feel anything for the leads. And as for Brawly...I didn't care if Easy ever found him and what had happened to him. Mouse is what made the Easy Rawlins Mysteries. This book was a disappointment."
4,Bad Boy Brawly Brown by Walter Mosely,"I love Mosely's books, especially Easy Rawlins. This was an attention keeper, as usual. Not my most favorite Rawlins but I have recommended it to my friends and other Mosely fans several times. Mosely Books are always worth the time and money."
5,I hope he never stops writing Easy Rawlins' novels.,This book was so good to me that I couldn't read it slow enough. I just didn't want to finish it. He is the master at this type of thing and is easily at his best with Easy. I hope that he finds a way to bring Mouse back. This is a must read.
5,Breath-taking,"This album is magnificent! The song ""Eyes On Me"" has to be the most beautiful song I've ever heard, it also goes along perfect with Final Fantasy 8, not only the words but the music and her voice make you feel for the characters. Without this song Final Fantasy 8 wouldnt be as good, thats how deeply this song can touch you.Not only this song but the whole track is filled with her beautiful voice and lyrics. I recommend this CD to everyone!"
4,Final Fantasy fans attention,This is the one of the songs of the up coming final fantasy VIII series. Which promises to be better than the last one. She has a sweet and charming voice. I wish her music was available to American Audiences. This is in English by the way.
5,Superb !,Faye has a very beautiful voice.It suites the song. It's like a magical voice in Eyes on Me floating around in your heart.
5,Geat Music,"Every Chance i get, i listen to this song. the artist's voice blends masterfully with the background music. A definite must for anyone interested in becoming a singer."
2,Not Worth The Cash,"KoRn has been my favorite band for a few years now, and i had the chance to spot this box set at a local record store. At first, I wanted it, but it really is a waste of cash. Only for the die-hard KoRn fan or one with lots of money"
5,Great book!,"Johnson does a great job of reporting on the horrible way gays and lesbians were treated by the federal government during the McCarthy era. He puts the action of the government in the context. And, by recounting the personal stories of many of the federal workers who lost their livelihoods during these purges, Johnson adds depth and feeling to what otherwise could have been a dry academic work."
4,Great product for the price,"I bought this trumpet stand to hold my trumpet on my fireplace ledge to go along with my jazz themed living room. It is sturdy and holds the trumpet well, even when my cats pass by and whack it with their tails. Great product, especially given the price. I also bought the clarinet stand for the same purpose."
5,Convenient and Safety,"Bought this for an adult beginner. Great and sturdy, much better than leaving your instrument on a chair while at rehearsal and on break. Folds up neat and tidy in the bell, but does add weight to the case. We have animals and if the trumpet is left in the stand for a quick break there is no worries that it will be knocked over."
5,Good Sturdy Trumpet Stand!,"The legs are nice and strong, metal and the stand is sturdy. Unlike tri-pod trumpet stands, you won't have it become unbalanced and fall over causing costly repairs!"
5,Very good trumpet stand,"The stand is sturdy, can be easily stored in the bell of your trumpet so it fits in a case, and, most important, is very stable. There is not a lot that a trumpet stand needs to do, but some stands do their job well and others not so well. This stand is simply outstanding at its job."
3,Trumpet Stand,Good stand. I like the way it can be stored in the bell of the instrument. I wish it actually allowed the instrument to stand above the floor more.
5,K & M Trumpet Stand KC- It's just AWESOME,"I Bough this trumpet stand and I love it, great price and awesome quality!!. They delivered it in less then 2 days I was so happy. I would defenetly recommend buying it, perfect stability with the five legs, portable."
4,Great book to learn about the 80% of pool you are ignoring,"I've been playing for about 4 months and have really gotten into the game. I've bought a lot of books about how to ""make this shot"" or ""what strategy to use in a game of 9-ball"" but I didn't have a book about the mental side of the game. I picked up this book to fill that gap.I read it and found some useful ideas but was a little disappointed that I didn't find more. A week after buying the book I entered my first tournament at a local pool room. I didn't do as well as I would have liked but couldn't understand why. That night I went home and looked through this book again. Suddenly it was like a totally different book. After having played in the tournament I realized what this book really teaches you: How to think about pool and your playing. If you are into playing pool seriously, you need this book. A great addition to your shelf."
5,putting things in perspective,"a great analysis of the mental side of pool. Lots of information on the competitve side of pool: how to gear up, dealing with slumps and streaks, etc. Just as important, he emphasizes that pool should be enjoyable, whatever one's manner of enjoyment might be, from very leisurely to ultra-serious. To sum it up, ""There is so much to love about pool that it is simply foolish to waste any time on the negatives."" I have to second this; browsing this book alot lately has made me want to play, learn and enjoy the game again, after several months of hardly playing at all. Capelle certainly does not dissappoint."
1,Strictly Political Agenda and No Substance.,"I bought this book as a gift for one of my best students. I previewed it, like I preview all of my gifts to promising students and found it wanting. Yes, there is no Boole. Nothing about Boethius, Casiodorus Senator, Martianus Capella, or any of the other precursors of the Seven Liberal Arts. Godel was treated like a Hatchet Man instead of the Thoughtful Mathematician who delved into Philosophy. Chomsky was HIGHLY OVERRATED, getting 3 pages of coverage when one sentence max would have sufficed.It is a Political Agenda Book with the Trappings of a Comic Book under the Pretense of being a Logic Book. It will be my companion when I go to the Toilet as I rip out the pages for better use in Sanitation."
3,fun Hedy Lamarr romantic drama,"Following a series of badly-received films, M-G-M allowed Hedy Lamarr to set up her own production unit inside the studio where she could develop properties that were tailor-made for her. DISHONORED LADY was one of the films she made during this time, based on a play written by Edward Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes (and originally staged on Broadway by renowned Guthrie McClintic). She plays Madeleine Damien, a sophisticated magazine designer who abandons her hedonistic lifestyle, only to be implicated in a murder. She co-stars with her husband at the time, John Loder, and they have a good onscreen rapport. With Dennis O'Keefe and Natalie Schafer."
3,Hedy Lamarr Strange Woman,"I had never watched Hedy Lamarr (except for ""Hedley"" Lamarr in Blazing Saddles). I actually bought this item for a friend, but I also watched it. Typical Hollywood movie for `starpower' and likely more enjoyable at the time. Seems a little naive or almost infantile by todays standards. But an enjoyable movie by a very good looking actress, second only to Barbara Parkins in my opinion."
4,Low self esteem is a problem,We all have our problems.The women in this movie shows that by effortwe can overcome the obstacles of our personalshort comingsand meet our better expectations for ourselves.Today is the first day of our future life.
2,Awful,One of the worst pair of shoes I bought. When you walk in them they make a farting noise. I rated them a two because they are soft on the inside. You can't wear them because it sound like you are passing gas as you walk. Not much else to say. A lesson learned.
3,Error in content description,"A correction - the first film in this set is not ""Singing Outlaw"". It is in fact ""The Black Outlaw"".In this film, Bob plays two parts - twins - one who has grown up to be an outlaw, and the other a sheriff. Guess which has the upper-hand at the halfway point. Now guess who wins out at the end. Oh, you've seen it!"
3,I'LL KEEP MY LASERDISC COPY!!!!,"I don't have to get up and flip over my laserdisc copy of Schindler's List- the player switches sides automatically. There's NO excuse for having a DVD which requires you to have to get up and flip it over, when there are two layers on one side available, even for a long movie such as this. It's not that I'm lazy, but techonologically there's no excuse.The movie is absolutely fantasic (5 stars) but the dual sided ""flipper"" DVD and the shoddy packaging get 1 star, for an average of 3 stars. The DVD was very dusty as packaged inside the shrinkwrap (like the DVD's sat around at the factory a long time before they were eventually packaged). The packaging looked to be a rush job, even though this movie should have been released on DVD already. Universal apparently is trying to maximize profits because they know this film will sell anyway even with shoddy packaging."
1,Schindler's List DVD,I am a first time user of Amazon. Product purchased DVD did not work between tracks 15 & 20 on side one.Not a good experience for a first time user. The DVD has been returned by mail and I expect it to be replaced or a refund issued to include the additional cost of mailing the DVD back.
2,"You can always count on Spielberg to ""improve"" history.","This is good fairly good movie, some rather clunky symbolism aside, except for the fact that it's not the way it happened. After doing some research I find 75-90% of this story is invented. Schindler was a business man who went broke in Nazi Germany by bribing officials & helping to hide Jews. But he wasn't the bon vivant playboy as shown in the movie, he didn't have a long struggle to develop conscious, and most of the plot is supposition at best. If you prefer schmaltz to facts you will probably love it, but if you want history don't look to this movie."
1,Haphazardly thrown together.,"The actual movie was GREAT. The DVD was put together so fast that the sound is off, I mean really OFF, in some scenes, you can't even hear what is going on, & I had my sound ALL the way up. This should have been put on 2, but they put it on 1, back to back, side A & side B, side 1 & side 2. Where was quality control, when this was being made??????"
2,Schindler's List,"This movie wasn't anything like I expected it to be. We didn't even completely finish watching it. For years, I didn't want to see this movie because of what I thought the content was. My family lived during this period of time and it wasn't pleasant."
2,Movie Reveiw,"I ordered this movie without having ever seen it before. I got it, watched it, and was pretty disappointed. It was so boring I coulden't get through the whole movie."
5,Simple Fantastic - Keep Kids Away (and Teen boys!),"This movie is wonderful in its sadness. It shows the exploitation of the Jewish people during WWII and it does so without apology. No apology is needed because those horrors must be exposed to help keep them from occurring ever again.Why Hollywood cannot make ONE movie without showing a breast is beyond me though. Totally out of place, just done gratutiously. Keep your teen boys away.Other than its deliberate exposure of the woman (not a prisoner, she was there to entice audience only) and its attempt to demean women in the audience by showing - once again - an actress exploited for the world to see - this movie's address for the concentration camps and Schindler's incredible attempt to do all in his power to stop the horrors is a masterpiece.The word masterpiece is overused in Hollywood. The word masterpiece is not overused on Schindler's List. This is Neeson's finest performance."
5,Must See,"Frankly, I'm just ordering the DVD now, but I wanted to add one thing to all these reviews. This is the ONLY movie I ever saw in a theatre where no one -- and I mean no one -- got up out of their seats for over three hours! This is an absolutely spellbounding film, one of the best ever made! I can't wait to add this DVD to my collection."
5,A Top 10 Film of All-time!,I have only seen this on the big screen so I am not sure how it looks on video. The use of black and white was sheer genious and the times color was used was the most effective since The Wizard of Oz. I am not a huge Liam Neelson fan but his performance in this film was huge. The film is the closest I have seen to capturing the horror of the holocaust while still having the characters appear very human.
3,Multiple defects on the DVD,"I choose this classic movie to add to 'My Favorite' movie group. Liam Nissan is outstanding in his role as Oskar Schlindler, and Steven Speilberg once again showed his superior directing talents. Upon inspection of the DVD I found a defect on the outside rim. It didn't want to load, and I had to work with it multiple times before it worked. Half was through the movie it stopped and would not proceed. I had to reload (with difficulties again) and proceed via fast forward to the spot again, re-do entire procedure, but advanced it beyond the scene which I never was able to view. It was without complete defect beyond that spot, but 'burped' a few more times. It was quite bothersome and seriously deminished the movie experience, being interrupted as such. It is in the process of being sent back and replaced."
5,A MUST SEE Movie.,"A Movie so ""well done"", with Intrigue, Reality and Compassion that will inspire you to be a better person. Everyone on this Earth should see this film based on true events."
4,Was used/slightly worn.,"If the plastic DVD holder wasn't cracked and the discs weren't slightly scratched, then this buy would have been an A+. As it stands its a solid B+. I would shop with the merchant again. The. Buy it now prices were very fair."
2,5-star movie with 1-star packaging,"As others have observed, the packaging for this movie is abominable. Furthermore, the extras are nowhere near what is expected of such a monumental work of cinema. No commentary, no trailers; Finding Nemo had better extras than this DVD. I really enjoy this film, but it deserved better than this."
2,Horrible DVD package for a great movie,"Loved the movie. I've been waiting a long time for this DVD.BUT!The DVD package is horrible. Very cheap ""folder like"" packaging. The little manual that comes with the DVD keeps falling out. AND the dvd is a flipper! Side A contains the half the movie, side B contains the rest of the movie with worthless bonus material!I am very dissappointed."
2,The worst DVD release ever?,"Well, maybe not the worst. Disney's non-skippable previews take that prize. But here it is 2004 and this studio has *finally* released this epic film on an unnecessarily (GAG!) two-sided DVD packaged in (GAG!) cardboard. What's even worse than having to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the film is that the stupid DVD won't default to the DTS sound track. It's got that insulting message that assumes we consumers don't know what DTS is. And on my first viewing, I realized 75% thru that I was no longer hearing the better DTS soundtrack after the flip. That was so annoying it just ruined the whole experience for me."
5,absolutely amazing,"Beautifully written, directed and carried out. Very realistic. Absolutely everyone should have to see this movie. No one should ever be allowed to forget what took place during that time, no one should be allowed to ignore it, and whatever restitution we can manage should be done. I hurt for all of the families that suffered, as should we all."
5,Intense...,A graphically intense view of the horrors of war and prejudice. The human soul has its dark side and its compassionate side. There's nothing else out there that compares to this.
5,"It's the most incredible film, it is history!","It is about human beeing. It's real en absolutely terrifying, but it is good that we can see what happened, only fifty years ago! It's almost unbelieveble that this happened. The movie is very real and Liam neeson and the other players act very good and believeble, my compliments!"
5,A Spielberg triumph,"A lot of Steven Spielberg films are my favorite movies. There's his greatest film Saving Private Ryan, Amistad, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws, and his other cinematic triumph Schindler's List. List is a powerful film about the horrors of concentration camps and how we treat people as a society. While it wasn't quite as horrific as Saving Private Ryan, it holds its own ground as being a masterpiece. I would advise anyone who hasn't seen Spielberg's dramatic films to start with this one."
3,It was alright,"First of all I'm sick and tired of hearing people complain about the two-sided disc. I wasn't any happier about it, but all I had to do was get off my lazy butt and change the side. That aside, I just finished watching the movie and I thought it was pretty good. I don't know how acurate it was, but Oskar Schindler was a good man. He was the only one who seemed to care enough about the Jewish people to try to save them. Yeah, he made them work for very little wages in his factory, but it was better than being shot in the back of the head. I wouldn't consider buying this movie, but I would suggest renting it."
5,finally a release date,"I have been waiting two years for Schlinder's List to be released. My VHS copy is a little worn. Some reviews say this is a movie to be viewed only once because of its subject matter. I personally think this movie should be shown in all middle school classrooms (along with Bowling for Columbine). If you are ever down or depressed about something, just watch this movie and all your problems will seem petty compared to what these brave souls endured. It really helps me/saddens me/humbles me to watch the movie and once viewed, it will never leave your mind."
1,Great Film-Appalling DVD,"What a huge disappointment finally getting Schindler's List on DVD has been for me.It was like going back to the late Nineties...A DVD with an added extra - an Intermission!! Marvellous - not. Why was this splendid film not given the respect it deserves and given a proper, up-to-date DVD release?? I thought flip-over discs went out in about 1999?I waited ages for Schindler's List to get a DVD release, and then this dog's breakfast. I cannot believe Mr S. would have sanctioned such a thing had he had the power to intervene.My advice is to continue to watch SL on VHS without the enforced break. Try and buy it on DVD in about 2009, when it may well have been put onto one side of one disc."
4,"To The Point, Solid Documentary!","Gives you a clear mental image, on what took place during the Holocaust. The film is in Black and white, which gives it a classic touch. Although it is pretty lenghthy, It isn't hard to follow, but I reccommend having ""some"" prior knowledge about the Holocaust, before viewing this movie."
1,I would give the DVD zero stars if possible.,"The movie is great, but the DVD is horrible. There is absolutely NO excuse for making this disc a ""flipper."" I am incredibly disappointed."
3,Should have been better,"i love this film but can't say the same for the DVD. The Dvd just looked cheap. There's no art so it just looks like one of those rewritables. Should have been on two dvds. Then theres the awful cover which is just made from paper material! Just after opening the cellophane wrap i got fingerprints all over it. The cover should have been the traditional plastic. If the marketers really wanted paper, they should have put the paper over the plastic cover like how Beauty and Beast is done. This is arguably one of the greatest movies but the dvd edition does not come close to doing it justice."
2,Overrated,"I find it amazing how many people have given this movie 5 stars. I can see why, given the subject matter. I think this is a movie people are afraid to criticize publicy, for fear that they will be labeled anti-semitic or insensitive, and to say the movie sucked it like saying the Holocaust didn't happen. They're completely independent of each other. The subject matter in this movie is shocking and grim. But let's face it: this movie drags and there's very little character development. If this were a documentary, it would be one thing, and it would be far more powerful. But it's a movie: it needs to do something. It's obvious that Spielberg thought he could just recreate the Holocaust, roll the film and, voila, instant critically lauded film that no one would DARE detract from because of what it's about. Sorry, but you need to have a little more than that. This movie does not cut it."
5,Spielberg's version of the holocaust,"What a great movie this was. One tends to forget that this film surpasses the 3-hour mark, because it moves so easily and quickly. The shocking imagery of the cruelty and ruthlessness of the Germans is like a slap in the face, and that is exactly what Spielberg wants, and achieves. This by no means is a film to see and re-see. Once is enough, because the images stay in the back of your mind. It is a beautifully made and shocking film, with excellent performances from all."
5,Winner of 7 Oscars including Best Picture of 1993!,"Stephen Spielberg's extraordinary epic retelling of German war profiteer Oskar Schindler, a superb Liam Neeson, risking all that he has to save over 1,000 Jews amidst the awful genocide of World War II. This is quite simply the most vivid, powerful, and unforgetable cinematic experience I had in 1993. Spielberg's labour of love is truely destined to be a classic, desevedly so, because by refusing to spare us the horrific pain and death of the Holocaust, Spielberg has made a film that will forever remind all who view it of the wonder and importance of Life."
1,Great Movie. . . Faulty DVDs,"I previously owned the movie on VHS, but wanted the more compact DVD. The first DVD started skipping around 50 minutes, then froze. My newer DVD player spit it out at that point and said it was unplayable. I took it back to the store I bought it (not amazon) and received a new copy. The look of the DVD was different so I was hoping the problem was fixed. This time I got 1 hour and 15 minutes in again and the same thing happened. I looked at this DVD and it has a large scratch on it. Now I have to trudge back to the store a third time to see if I can actually get a copy that will allow me to watch the entire movie. Good thing I have seen it before."
1,Definitely Manufacturing Issue with the disk,I've gone through two DVD's already of the 2 sided release of this movie and both DVD's start skipping around chapter 15. Don't buy this DVD until they come out with a fixed release.
1,Disgracefull packaging,"Universal should be ashamed of themselves. To package one of the greatest and most important films of all time in a cheap, non-sealing cardboard folder that provides totally inadaquate protection from dust and damage to one side of the two sided disk is simply disgraceful. Like others who have expressed themselves in this forum, I feel as though I've been ripped off.There, I feel better, but I'd feel even better if Universal were offer a free replacement package that provided adequate protection for the disk.One the subject of the disk, the transfer is first rate. I don't mind that the film is split (presumably so that they could provide the image quality they did), but I would have very much preferred that it be on two separate disk. It seems to me that two-sided disks are more subject to handling damage than are one-sided ones."
4,"Great movie, poor packaging","I couldn't wait for this dvd to come out. Now that it finally has, I wonder, why did they have to use such poor packaging? A regular dvd case would have been nice. Instead they slapped this two sided dvd into a slim, open ""book like"" package. If the packaging was any worse, I may not have bought the dvd, which would have been a shame since I have been looking forward to owning this movie on dvd..."
2,Disappointing DVD Presentation,"I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of ""unethical"" thing!"
3,"Well done and an important story, but overhyped","The Spielberg hype machine was in full tilt when I saw this movie. I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this film. It seems to borrow from ""Night of the Generals"" and has none of the Holocaust reality of ""Shoah"" that was later projected in a truly great World War II film, ""The Pianist"".I think my personal disappointment about this and other Steven Spielberg dramas is shared by my opinion of Tom Hanks dramas. I simply don't think these directors have what it takes to be great dramatic directors -- a large slice of terror, pessimism or negativity in their personalities. I think they are too sunny and that sunshine cannot be hidden, even in topics like the Holocaust. For me, ""Schindler's List"" is not a great film and does not compare to the great World War II films. I think it compares to ""Night of the Generals""."
2,Where are the Sub-Titles?,"The answer is you don't need them becoue everyone speaks English. I was reminded of a movie I once saw in which Japanese speaking cowboys fought Japanese speaking Native Americans! But this was even worse. Good Guy Nazi Liem Neeson speaks English with a phony American accent while Bad Guy Nazi Ralph Fiennes speaks English with a phony German accent. It couldn't have been any more blatant if they had white hats and black hats.What upsets me is that these are great actors under the direction of a great director depicting actual events which should be shown with the utmost realism. What we have is Neil Armstrong stepping out onto the lunar surface and saying, ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."" But the words coming out of his mouth are Russian."
2,This movie is not for me,"I thought this movie is just Oskar Schindler to help the Jews to get out of their country, but it is not. It has a lot of killings that I don't like. It is pretty okey. This movie is 5 stars but someday it will turn out to be 4.5 stars. That is so nice."
3,This movie is kind of hard to understand.......,This move is hard to understand because the characters in the movie talk too fast. What's more this movie is in black and white. I hate black and white. This movie is made in 1993 and why they cannot put in color. I think it's an excellent movie.
5,Life Changing,"I have never actually seen this movie, but my friend ed(not his real name...security reasons...I think you understand....whatta you mean if you really loved me you would tell....why do you always have to bring that up? Look I told you, it was a scavanger hunt! Nobody was too upset, the only one who really dwells on it is you; and you weren't even supposed to see that), anywhoo, Ed said this movie was really good. And trust him (finest sonuvabitch to have in a foxhole with you). One time he told me about this place that served Italian Beef that was the best ever. Well I went there, and it was good but not great. So I get home and I say hey ed, it was pretty good, but what the heck? Well turns out I had gone to the wrong place, so I went to the actual resturant that Ed had recommended, and it was dang good. So the moral of this story is TRUST ED! Also, if you happen to find a day planner at this restaurant..it's denim, got a picture of a kitten on it and says hang loose. Tell me."
1,Pathetic,"Steven, Money God, Spielberg should be ashamed. What a horrible way to rip off fans of this movie with this cheaply designed dvd. I lose more respect for that man with each passing moment."
1,"See Winds of War, War and Remembrance, Escape from Sobibor a","As good as Malcolm X, JFK, Nixon, the last Emperor and Titanic, with the same degree of subtle low key propaganda and deep insight into the human spirit. The lack of historical falsification in service of a political agenda at odds with American culture is, of course, typical of modern Hollywood product but gratifying never the less. One looks forward to Spielberg's next film with Nazis. He does them so well. One point. The black and white photography was a bit poor. B&W is not just without color but an art in and of itself."
1,An insult to Humanity.,"The fact that the American Nation, and with it the entire Western Civilization, is getting sillier by the minute, is not only Spielberg's fault. But one can not underestimate the immense contribution that Hollywood, to which this person is a dear son, has had in desensitizing people to everything that is human. ""Schindler's List"" a simplistic, mathematically melodramatic attempt to, popularize a subject that should not have been popularized at all. The Jewish Holocaust was not a Hollywood melodrarma, but a reality, and this reality is still with us, as humans, whether direct or indirect victims, as perpetrators, or as potential victims and perpetrators of similar realities."
2,Jewish Suffering Sells... BIG!,"Spielberg, like most of his lot, is a pimp. Do yourself a favor and read ""The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering"" by Norm Finkelstein."
2,Boring,"I appreciate the sentiment behind this film. I understand what this story is about (the holocaust). Its a serious subject. I tried to watch this movie on TV a few years ago and just couldn't get into it. I tried to get interested three different times, but it was just plain boring.I also found out where the ""Seinfeld"" show got the idea to have one of Elaine's boyfriends carry on about how he could have ""done more!"" He could have shown Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld so much more...etc etc. That's what Oskar Schindler says at the end of the movie. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but laugh. I guess Jerry Seinfeld (who is Jewish), or his writers, felt the same way."
1,ABYSMAL,"In which Steven Spielberg replicates Ophuls's ""Sorrow and the Pity"" with all the subtlety of ""The Color Purple"" or ""1941."" This film proved to be the signpost of the decade, in which technical superiority reigns over the film itself. Spielberg grabs the audience and forces emotion down it's collective throat. Vile, insincere, and a thin-veiled attempt at an Academy Award (albeit successful). Spielberg is saved by his ace cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, and a top-flight cast."
1,"Holocaust as Family Drama, Awful Junk","This film is very empty, for not only does it portray the Germans as ""evil, lop-sided, devil worshippers"" but it shows the Jews as being ""promising, alluring, good guys"". If one is to question morality, then do so, but do not give us the black vs white issue found in this film. Speilberg, immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and sentimentality. In effect, the film lacks any moral basis except to denounce all evil men and with that, we learn absolutely nothing....."
2,Oskar Schlinder was a criminal as he stated,"He should have been captured and hung for his crimes of having slave labor and collaborating with the evil nazis,despite the fact he may have saved some jews, does not excuse his initial intent of profiteering at the expense of the jews slave labor"
5,"Review for ""Schindler's List""","I have not yet seen, a World War 2 movie as good and touching as this one. It is a remarkable peice, and everyone, should some day see it. It is a picture of the grim and realistic things that happened, but still keeping the beautiful and fragile aspects in touch. It truly should have gotten more awards, and should be though of as a classic. When you watch this movie, the length or color will not bother you. It's the story that is truly, the most remarkable thing ever put on a screen. It will leave you speechless. It is a remider of the era of darkness."
5,WOW!,There is one thing that I think Universal Pictures could do for this film and that is to release an awsome DVD transfer to this.I have never sceen a better anti-war flick before out of the bunch. Everyone should watch this. The wideccreen virsion.
1,A Darn Shame!!!,A great movie like this on a double sided disc??? You would think that after all the waiting for this DVD the product would be better....
2,every German is evil?,this movie is in my opinion extreme hate propaganda against germany and its people even the hero schindler is shown in this movie as a bad-corrupt guy-in over 180 minutes I cannot find just one second where the jew isn't shown as the victim with sad dog eyes and the german like an evil monster without any human feelings-this is pure hollywood but far far away from reality.technical good made but not realistic at all.
5,Most important film of all time !,"I am not an enormous fan of Speilberg's work as a whole, but there is no denying that this is the classic cinematic work of the century. I've probably seen this masterpiece five or six times over the years and the emotions never fade."
4,True HIstory,"A true story of WWII. What can happen when you do not/or cannot believe it can happen, and happen to YOU.When men do not know history, they are doomed to repeat it!"
5,Deserved the Oscars it recieved,"Classic film at it's finest. Needs to be in every library of good WWII films.While it is in black and white, this will not reduce your enjoyment of this film. In truth? I don't know if I could have stood watching it in color."
5,schindlers list,Every time I watch this movie I have to stop and take a deep breath - and then go back to watching. So moving that it is almost impossible to believe that this is all true. It makes you think twice about your relationships with other people in this world.Top ten movie of all timeGreat Buy !Z
5,Spielberg's Best,"Maybe the most affecting film I have ever seen, Schindler's List is definitely the film everyone should see at least once. Spielberg tells this Holocaust tale of an unexpected hero with a surprising mix of beauty and horror. Filmed mostly in black and white, the movie is at times tough to watch, but this is because of its raw power and ability to transport you to a part of world history that many would like to forget but cannot (nor should they).This is definitely Spielberg's greatest film. He has never been able to match the power since."
5,Schindler's List,A must have movie. I watched it once and then started it again. It's one of the stories that stays with you.
5,I love it,"I own Schindler's List - Collector's Widescreen Gift Set It deserves ten Star,MR Steven Spielberg is too Much ,hes a legend :)"
2,Its not that great,"Oh my, should someone dare say this is not a great film. Well its not. This film is too, I don't know, good and evil is too simplified. This movie looked too much like a movie.I want to recommend another movie, that is lightyears above this one, its called Come and See. Spielberg ripped off this one big time. Come and See is more human, realistic, and horrifying than this overproduced drivel."
1,Have not received this item,I have not received Schindlers list I ordered this in July and it is now Sebtember with not a sign of it coming.Ifind this to be very slack as you have received or payment
3,not as good as i thought,"Liam Neeson is excellent once again but I just didnt think this was as good as expected. Also I dont see why there was so many nude shots. There not the shots you'd expect in a holocaust film, tortured and deprived humans. They are straight up nude woman! Probably the only movie Speilberg could get the chance to film it so he made sure to take advantage of it. Also, the german soldiers just act like goons. Their child-like gullibiliy was way to over the top for me and made it all less believable. Overall this is another totally hollywoodized portrayal of a true and more dramatic story but because of the subject matter it is unthinkable to call this anything but classic."
4,Good way to draw attention!,"I Suggest offering this movie for free for the people of Israel. May be someone there can get ashamed from himself and try to do what Oskar Schindler did for their ancestors to the besieged Palestinians under their brutal occupation and horrible ""new"" fence."
1,Ridiculous Hollywood,"Anyone who makes a feel good movie about the Holocaust is a total crackpot. Move over, Mel Gibson.Mr. S should stick with kiddie flicks like ET - although even there he was cruel to the actress who performed inside the ET suit."
1,Was Speilberg tired when he filmed this?,"This was a very slow movie! It is as slow as...Meet Joe Black! It is not funny at all! If you want too see an excelent film watch Life is Beautiful, it is a great movie!"
1,Terrible,"I cannot for the life of me think of what the point was behind the scene where a supposed gas chamber actually turns out to be a shower room. Is Spielberg implying that the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz never happened? Probably not, but this scene can definitely be interpreted that way. The only conclusion I can come up with is that Spielberg intended to convey some form of relief for his audience, but since the gassings of Jews and other ""undesireables"" was pretty much the cornerstone of the Holocaust, it seems to me that he just copped out. Granted there were other scenes that were difficult to watch, but if he wanted to create an accurate historical document, by some accounts, he should've portrayed the unfathomable horror of a gassing. However difficult that might've been I'm sure the audience would've gotten the message. This movie fails because of this scene."
2,Conerned about anti-German Violence,"As we have seen with ""the Passion of the Christ"" resulting in AntiSemetic violence, I have grave concerns this re-release of Schindler's list on DVD will result in anti-German violence...."
4,Schindler's List,I was happy with the service of Amazon. Got my DVD in a short period of time. I like their variety in movies.
5,A Portrait of Inhumanity,"People have written quite a bit on how wonderful this movie is, so I suppose there isn't much for me to add. The haunting images, the haunting music...I last saw this movie a few years ago, and I can still feel my throat tighten when I think of certain scenes. Not to short-change Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley (who are magnificent), but I must mention that Ralph Fiennes is absolutely convincing and terrifying in this movie. (I read that he was so convincing that the Holocaust survivors on the set refused to shake his hand.) His portrait of a man without values (or, perhaps more accurately, with his own, warped values) is a triumph that lingers and that makes you wonder how the existence of such a man is possible within the realm of humanity."
5,Emotionally Stiring and Beautifully Mesmerizing!,"Easily one of the Greatest War Films of All-Time. The film presents the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a member of the Nazi party who incedibley saves the lives of over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The most powerful film of 1993, beautifully shot in black and white it captures the shocking and cruelty of the film. Steven Spielberg's epic masterpice of drama acomplishes something nearly impossible without ever preaching, it's truly Spielberg's greatest film. Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Screenplay, Cinematography, Music, Editing, and Art Direction, and Director."
1,LOUSY DVD FORMAT WITH WEAK EXTRAS,"I am reviewing the DVD, not the film.Here we have one of the best films of the 1990s, and Spielberg makes it a flipper. In 2004, the fact that we have to turn this DVD over is moronic, and Spielberg knows better. The extras are mediocre. Just think what he could have done, with a documentary on the Holocaust. Why it took so long to get this DVD in print is beyond me. And the container is cardboard, and gives no listing of the chapters. The so-called container that holds the inserts is open at the bottom so the inserts fall out.The DVD concept is one of the marvels of technology in the last decade. And Spielberg, who prides himself with being technologically advanced, gives us a DVD that could have been made in the early 1990s. So sad that such a great film gets such a lousy presentation."
2,DVD.,The DVD kept freezing up. The DVD was supposed to be new. I was very unhappy with this product.
5,Schindler's List,"I can't not explain how well this movie was done. Though the horrors of the Holocaust are not something that is taken lightly I can still say that this is one of my favorite movies of all times. The story that this movie tells is not only sad, but very powerful and gives a great account of what people had to go through during the Holocaust. I believe that this movie should be viewed by all high school students in history classes so they can get a semi-real feeling of what people went through during this awful reign of Hitler. I'm glad a DVD version finally came out."
3,Interesting view from a public health perspective,"I was just a teenager, but I remember Operation New Life. I helped moving bags, and delivering food to the refugees just after they stepped off the planes. I visited Orote Point, too.This was interesting from a public health perspective. A member of my immediate family was also there and is now a public health officer. I am interested in his take on this pamphlet. (No, it's a stretch to call this a book.)Mackie shows an obvious distaste for the military, and seemingly views America as imperialistic in its possession of the Marianas Islands. Local government (GovGuam), though, shines in Mackie's eyes. I found it hard to keep from stumbling over these tonal qualities as I read the narrative.Overall, though, I did enjoy reading this. How quickly we forget our own history."
1,Don't take the chance!,"We also had these break. I'm telling you, not worth the chance... Use something else!!!"
1,not good..,every time I use it. it brakes.. what the hell is up with this product. I got 3 pkgs and I don't want to use them any more they are no good.
1,EHhh?,Love Harry Potter. Seriously such a huge fan of everything harry potter. I was about to buy this backpack but I just couldn't because the eyes freak me out :/ wish they had another model of this!
5,A fantastic compilation of contemporary Trinidad music,"David is one of the most talented writers of the modern era. His vision, depth and poetry are the product of an unusualy gifted individual. His renditions are also tremendous. Any one who has the opportunity to listen to his music or to hear him perform should grab the opportunity. It is an event one would not forget."
5,Great CD !!,"David Rudder at his best. The man has so much talent. What a great inspiration. This CD just exemplifies the greatness of this man. Definately ""High Mass"" takes the cake, but ""The Savagery"" and ""Beloved"" are close behind. A CD Full of Rhythm. A must have !"
1,Terrible Product,"Bought two 3-packs of the smaller cans at a hardware store (they were out of the large ones). It proudly claims ""Up to 3 hrs burn time"" when in reality we got about 20 or 30 minutes out of each one. I guess they were lying - it did say ""up to"" and not ""at least."" Needless to stay our little buffet did not stay warm near as long as expected. Terrible, would not recommend."
5,Track List,"Tony Faline - Stop, Drop & Funk / Union Records / 1999 /Track list:1} Pump Up The Levels2} Breakdown3} The Groove4} Get Up5} Let Me Tell you6} Break@Dawn - (Sugarwood)7} Beat It8} Listen to This - (Sugarwood)9} Go10} We Out"
1,"I was hoping for ""Plays Pretty for the People""!","I entered this site specifically to order 'Sil Austin Plays Pretty for the People'. What a disappointment. Earlier today while riding in my car, a local radio station played the entire album. It took me back in time and I rushed home to order thhis album specifically. Hopefully, enough fans of the great Sil Austin will prompt promoters to put this wonderful album on a CD, or, at least an audiocassette."
1,Disapointed,"I was looking for ""Plays Pretty for the People"". To me this is his toprelease and showcases his many facets. Please guys lets make this available! Thanks to other opinions I won't bother with ""Great Sax""."
4,not as expected,"This book was well written. However, it wasn't the romance novel I was hoping it would be. I found it to be a little depressing. The two main characters didn't have many scenes together. If you are looking for a well written historical romance (with very little romance) this won't disappoint you. I was looking for something a little lustier than this had to offer. I had to give it four stars, though, because it was an enjoyable read. It wasn't what I thought it would be, and yet I couldn't put it down for long."
4,Just what I wanted,I ordered these glasses to replace glasses that had broken. I wanted the same shape and weight because they feel very comfortable when I am holding them.
5,Un libro tan excelente que ha durada siglos,"Ya no es original loar el libro Don Quijote de la Mancha (I y II)pero es obvio por que esta obra influyo y todavia influye muchas escritores incluyendo Garcia Marquez (cien anos) y Borges(su cuento en que un autor intenta re-escribir la obra). El primer volumen es mucho mas comico (la imagen famosa de Quijote atacando los molinos viene de este volumen) y el segundo es mas tragico cuando el lector se da cuenta del cuesto humano de la locura del hidalgo y tambien la inhumanidad do los demas. Analiza lo que es ser loco, el dano de obsesionar en cosas del pasado y, ademas de otras temas, la importancia de la amistad (como la entre Quijote y Sancho Panza) Una obra particular que mas ciertamente merece su titulo como clasico."
5,Excellent Conditions,"This version is hard to find, I tried local book stores with no luck. The book was tagged as used but looks like it's brand new, got a great deal!"
4,solid,"Levin's undergraduate book is very complete. A course like this would be an excellent foundation for a graduate course later on. If you've ever looked at gasiorowicz, which is also quite complete, it's like that plus all the words/explaination that G-wicz is missing. I highly recommend this book."
1,dont get it if your looking for a turbo noise,This item is pointless unless you want your car to sound like i little bird tweeting i was excited when i got it and it wasnt anything like i wanted... Although it would be good to play a joke on someone with like i think i am going to do it to my sister hahaha...
3,"good idea, didnt work","Awesome idea here, but only fits small cars or ones with a single exhaust.Did'nt work for me, Just fell out the back when he started the truck..Laugh turned out to be on me since it didnt work LOL"
5,"Smaller than I thought, but it works","I rigged it in my cousins exhaust on his Navigator with duct tape to seal the air space and it worked great. The Navigator has a larger exhaust since it is a big vehicle.After he found it, I took it out and put it in the exhaust again, this time without duct tape. It works best if you put the two flaps facing outward, so they'd be facing you when you look in the exhaust pipe.I would buy again, and recommend it."
3,Funny Gag Gift,Product was shipped sooner than expected. I bought as a gag gift so I never actually tried it out. .
1,awful,one time use only. It is not loud and it falls out of the tail pipe easily. not a good product
1,Worst Album Ever,"This is the worst Dirty Dozen Brass Band album ever. Once again, somebody is trying to profit from the misfortune of others. Chuck D is quick to point the finger on the first track, but offers no thoughts as to a solution. Musically, I would say that this album is sub-par as compared to their other albums. Also, the political theme of the album will alienate some of their faithful listeners. I loved DDBB until this album came out. I'm not sure if I will coninue to listen."
4,Perhaps the best picturebook waiting for an update,I purchased this after our return from Peru and a visit to the Museo Tumbas Reales De Sipan in Lambayeque. The Museum and its collections were stunning and we wanted to have something to show people when we returned about the fabulous artwork and cultural artifacts of the Moche as photograpy was prohibited in the museum.There was no bookstore at the museum so I purchased this book on Amazon. As noted in the description it was published in 1993 and therefore could not have included all of the more recently excavated finds or restored artwork present in the museum which is the only problem with the book. The book is a good purchase for the account of the excavation and the description of Moche culture. There are many images included of Moche arts that were excavated at Sipan that to the surprise of most visitors eclipse the quality of the later Incas and are some of the most beautiful and intricate arts of antiquity.
3,NOT A MONITOR,"I purchased this LCD TV thinking that I could use it for a computer monitor as well, but it is really not designed for that purpose. Technically, I can plug it into the computer and get an image, but the image is exceedingly blurry because the resolution is that of a regular tv. There's no way you can read text that blurry. I had trouble getting information regarding this aspect from the documentation and online salespeople, so I thought I'd better post the info here. As a tv, it's fine, although the sound is not as good as my external 40W computer speakers. Also, it doesn't receive tv images without an external antenna or cable plugged in."
3,Commercial is right...,"This CD has some tight tracks on it...but DEFINITELY NOT what I would definte as REAL ELECTRO...If you wanna touch on it, try-out Electro Breakz Volume 6 mixed by EXZAKT...and that's only the tip of the iceberg...all I can say is that ELECTRO is MUCH deeper then this..."
3,Webb Pierce Sun Recordings,"I have had this recording for several years but found a replacement in ""More & More' on the Living Era label. The Sun recordings are later recordings, not the original. Webb appears to be tired of singing these songs. My guess is he is 20 years older than his hits days. His band (studio backup?), has only an inkling of the honky tonk sound. The steel guitar instead of driving the sound lies in the back ground. ""More & More"" has 30 songs against these 12. For early Webb Pierce check out ""Complete 4 Star & Pacemaker Recordings Complete 4 Star & Pacemaker Recordings""."
3,SATANIC SURFERS ARE NOT THE SAME ANYMORE,"This album is a pretty good one.But it's not as good as ""Hero of Our Time"" or ""Going Nowhere Fast""...In fact, since Tomek had left the band, the Surfers are not the same...if you are a huge fan, you must get it....if you're not...I think it's better to get the older albums, like ""666 Motor Inn""."
2,Disappointing.,"While you get the impression that the author knows his stuff, he doesn't write much of it down. The information provided is incomplete and not well supported, either with explanations or references. No topic is addressed in sufficient depth or detail as to provide a basis for good brewing decisions.I would recommend that anyone interested in a good introduction to the chemistry and biology of brewing instead acquire either one or both of George Fix's books, ""Principles of Brewing Science"" and ""Analysis of Brewing Techniques""."
1,made my dog sick,"My 9 lb maltese/ yorkie mix loved these at first and gobbled them up. The next day he got sick and when i took him to the vet he had an elevated white count and lipase. After administering medications he was better but again after he gobbled up the treats he became very sick.. wretching, decreased appetite and i am currently having to syringe feed him. Please be careful with these treats and bring your dog to the vet if he is not acting right.P.S. my dog regularly eats bully sticks without any problems and my maltese had no problems with this treat."
3,ok,"I bought this because my snap-on air ratchet went down after 7 yrs. The rebuild was more than this ratchet's price.I can't tell you how disappointed I was. It was either off or on, no variable speed. Occasionally the direction selector would get stuck and take a high effort to move. I eventually rebuilt my snap-on. This tool would be okay for home or as a backup, but thats it."
5,Marshall law is in effect,I must say before I start I am biased. I like Biafra and his work over the years.As always Jello Biafra provides some perspective to recent historical events (you the one I mean) and as always the accuracy of his words will be judged over time. His style is more relaxed than someone like Chomsky but his words have the same basic message. World events are just that. What we do as foreign policy and where we shop does have global repercussions and it's in all our interests to care.I can't help thinking that most of what he says he will be a matter of preaching to the choir which is a real shame because there is a whole world of knowledge out there waiting for us.
1,Don't waste your money,This product does not keep your ears warm and falls apart easily. Don't waste your money.
1,terrible!,Terribla band. Guys dont know theyre doing. They dont diserve to use GG Allin's name in their music.
5,Love this phone!,"I bought this item from a different store and must say it is a purchase I am proud of. It has many ring tones and jingles that I took the time deciding on rather than settling for. The answering machine on this model is great, and noticing you have messages and listening to them are super easy. Volume control is wonderful. The handset is small but not too small. I have a little one and she loves to take it around and pretend talk without harming it a bit. The features are great and the manual is straight forward and easy to use. I highly recommend this one if you only need one cordless."
1,Silliest Movie of the west,"Absolutely a stupid movie. Shoots all his ammo up in the last scene in a Rifleman like firing. Tosses his gun away to walk over to a tomahawk, never checking the murderous villain for a hidden gun. Gives himself up when it is certain death with the old I will shoot the girl bit."
4,Very Violent but Good Spaghetti Western,Burt Reynolds in the title role takes out revenge on Aldo Sanbrell and his gang in this extremely violent and unsympathetic Spaghetti Western. This film shows off Reynolds' great physique and athletic prowess (circa 1966) under Sergio Corbucci's direction. Ennio Morricone (Leo Nichols) composed a rather over the top pseudo-American Indian score which is just wild. The final confrontation between Reynolds and Sanbrell is so incredible it has to be seen.
4,Young Burt Reynolds saves the lives of the Indians.,"Here is an interesting early Burt Reynolds film released in 1966. It is a foreign film of Italian-Spanish. An interesting role for Burt Reynolds because in real-life he has Indian in him. Reynolds was probably the age of 29 at the time this was filmed. Good western. The villain, ""Duncan"" likes to scalp Indians. Navajo Joe (Burt Reynolds) looks out for his people on a white horse. Even when the saloon girls try to make a run for it to get away from the evil Duncan, Navajo Joe saves the girls lives. Native Indians will like the ending of this one. I would like to recommendMy Name Is Nobody(1973), starring the unforgetable Terence Hill, with Henry Fonda and Steve Kanaly (Kanaly later co-starred in the ""Dallas"" tv series)."
5,Endearing family movie,"What can I say? This is just a fantastic movie for the family, great cast, endearing story, fun to watch. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"Great, wholesome movie for the entire family",This was a movie my daughter begged me to watch - what a great memory we shared as we watched it. together.
4,Endearing and heartfelt,"A warm enjoyable move for the whole family. I enjoyed it, while some things so predicable...and why do writers always have to make the grandpa ill. Bailee Madison was adorable and worth watching just to see her performance."
4,Good family entertainment,This is worth the price for a good piece of family entertainment. Great riding and tricks performed by the cowgirls.
4,cute movie,this is a cute movie that is family friendly . i would watch this again and again . the young girl is a great actress .
3,Translators who love too much,"Translating is always, as they say, a labor of love, and yet the eyes of lovers are famous for falsifying their beloved. While we cannot accuse Britt's long awaited and long needed translation of Warburg into English of neglect, unfortunately the very care and attentiveness that he lavishes on the text, and his often overwrought attempt to get at its original meaning, results in almost grotesque distortions, as if, worried about how his beloved might appear under the gaze of his contemporaries, he feels the need to mask his beloved's true virtues with invented conceits. Two examples will suffice: the translation of ""ideal"" as ""ideological,"" --- as if he were ashamed of Warburg's somewhat naive reference to the transcendental tendencies of the Italian renaissance --- and of ""pathos"" as ""pagan histrionics,"" as if an American readership would necessarily stumble over this technical term from Aristotle's Poetics."
3,Series is losing drive.,"I suppose I should review this book based upon it's own merits and NOT in relation to the rest of the series.But I won't.This book when compared to the first book of the Mission: Gamma series is simply put: kind of boring. I found myself wanting to skip chapters to get away from the aimless cruising of the Gamma quadrant (even if they do hang out on a planet nearly the whole time) to get back to the events on DS9 itself. Though I do appreciate the desire to tell the events of both locations, I do wish that they had chosen to write two completely different stories, as the two together dilute one another.Still, the story in the Alpha quadrant is a fun read, and I would recommend this book on that merit alone.But I only recommend it if you can get it from the library."
5,"Well done, Heather!",This first work by Heather Jarman is fantastic. She has proven not only to be a good writer but also has a deep insight in thecharcters of the DS9 people. We want more of her!
2,Better than the first,"This book is better than its opening book but not entirely strong yet. There's action and contact with aliens that brings resolution to the Vaughn/Tenmei tension but still we're waiting for something to happen, something bigger than the dry belabored political issues that spin on and on and on.I think that these books are to be some sort of special form for the DS9 series, a block of books a year?Kira spends a lot of time walking around frustrated, angry, having really nothing to do but be a symbol of strength.Ummmmmm, aren't their any renegade.......pick a species!The Vahni are boring as the Defiant and crew warp through the Gamma Quadrant. What about a renegade changeling? Some kind of diabolical plot throughout the Gamma sector the Defiant would be involved in. But everything is so.....bland, safe, sanitary, Next generation.......you know wiritng this I'm a little upset.....I was originally gonna make it 3 stars but no, no, no it deserves only two!Onto Book Three!"
2,"Good story, but problems with the kindle version","I agree whole heartedly with all the other reviews of the plot, this is an excellently written DS9 Novel, and does a great job both following the DS9 TV series and making its own name.However, the translation to kindle seems to have introduced many typos. I don't know how books are made into eBooks for kindle, but I can't believe this book was printed with this many typos, something must have gone wrong in the translation. Towards the later half of the book, I was finding multiple typos on every page.By all means this book is a good story, I strongly recommend reading it, but if you don't like typos, I suggest you buy a paperback edition."
3,"Boy-and-his-dog story aimed at kids, but heavy on the civics","Columbia's ""Rusty"" series of the late 1940s were small-town dramas centering around Danny (Ted Donaldson, one of the better juvenile actors) and his German shepherd Rusty (a handsome animal). This entry has Danny and his pals encountering a mysterious, uncommunicative stranger in town, and running afoul of the man who owns the land where their clubhouse is. Youngsters will enjoy Rusty (and Rusty's girlfriend, Barb), but some of this plays like an instructional film; the morality-play script spreads the civics lesson mighty thick as the kids learn about good citizenship. The film is well made, like most Columbia's ""B"" pictures, and the print is gorgeous. A technical note: some copies of this title are in the extended-play mode and may not track properly on all machines."
2,wrong order,This picture & advertisement clearly states ULTRA PLUS pads. You sent me a package marked Maximum which is a much less effective product.
1,Dark Forest Of Lame,"This was by far the worst Asian Horror movie I have ever seen.This movie made no sense.Five hikers go into the forest and if you get cut in anyway the forest comes to life and kills you.Then you come back as a zombie and try to kill the rest of your friends.If you love Asian horror stay away from this movie.I found it very hard to watch and as the movie progresses it gets worse and worse.The storyline is pathetic,the acting is pathetic and the money you waste on this movie will be pathetic.Stay away,you have been warned."
4,Paranormal Activity Trilogy,"I've only watched the 1st one & I'm about to watch the second of the trilogy. It has sort of a Blair Witch tinge to it. The whole thing is shot w/a handheld. It was ok, if you like that sort of thing. I think it really worked in this film. I enjoyed it myself. However, there will be no Oscars here! All in all it was pretty good & yes I'll probably watch it again. WARNING: Don't watch this alone @ night. Every little sound you hear will bring you right back to the movie again. It's 2114. I guess I'll be watching this tomorrow. As TJ Holmes would say, ""You can go to bed now, but don't sleep."""
4,Found For A Cheaper Price,I was able to get the Paranormal Activity trilogy on Blu-Ray at Wal-Mart for around $25 where as on here they wanted almost $35 for it.
4,It doesn't glow like in the picture,"I bought this and a couple of other pet supplies for my 12 yr old $1.25 goldfish.I really like the color of the two plants and I thought Fishy might enjoy nice colorful things in the tank.When the package arrived,I was a little disappointed that the color was a lot darker green than shown in picture.Fishy seems to enjoy these plants because it swims thru the leaves a lot and doesn't seem to mind that it's not as nuclear glow green as it's anal pet parent would like.My son told me that we didn't buy these plants for me to swim around so if Fishy is enjoying them,who cares if I don't like the color."
5,dripless? yes,"They say ""virtually dripless"" - I'd say completely dripless. Very happy to not see a single drip on my table after hours of burn."
4,Great quality and design,"This headphones sounds great. The definition is incredible, but certainly you gonna miss the bass. In pictures the materials with was made this product, looks very well, but once you have in your hands, maybe it would be not that you expected.I'm very satisfied with this pair of headphones, but the materials makes not perfect."
3,"Break it in, and it's great... but....","MUST be burned in. Out of the box, disappointing, but after about 25 hours of use you can start to really hear a difference. At 100 hours, I love it! Much nicer overall than my ancient HD600's. When not using mine I connected it my headphone amp and an internet radio (to burn in), so after a couple of days it started to sound much better.Not for bassheads. Bass is there, but not exaggerated. More would be nice. But the overall performance of these phones makes this point mute. Nice highs and pretty good detail.Needs power to really shine. I don't think this will work optimally with portable music sources or home receivers without a headphone amp.Comfortable, even with my fat head.Later note:More burn in does not make bass.... It's just not enough for my classical music.After 3 weeks, I returned them, disappointed.Overrated, and a bit pricy."
1,"(""_"") not very happy with the sound they produce","I ran these headphones thru my iphone,my receiver,my iphone with a headphone amp (fiiO E7) and they still sound horrible.They sound like they need more highs,mids,and lows .I had to bring the volume all the way up on all my attempts.I really like the way they look and feel, but i had to send them back. For the price i paid i thought they would sound much better."
4,Awesome sound not so awesome comfortability,the sound quality is self explainable the comfort... well... it feels great around the ear. not much pressure. You know why? because all of the pressure is on ur head!!! i feel like a ton of books are on top of my head. It hurts for more than a few hours of wearing.
5,Seriously Wow,"I had originally asked for a pair of Audio Technica Headphones for Christmas because the price was so much less. I ended up getting $100 Amazon Gift Certificate through work. So my wife upgraded me to these (she wanted to get me Grados). I am so glad she got me these because as much as I remembered liking the Grado 22o's and the Audio Technica 700's, these are a step up. Very big, but amazingly comfortable.They immerse you with sound. I have Audio Research Electronics (Hybrid and Tubed) along with martin Logan speakers so I had just so-so expectations for these. Frankly, I am grinning. I will be getting X-Cans or Headrooms for the home stereo so I can interface these.I enjoy these immensely even with a TEAC Vintage unit I have in the office and, can you believe a laptop even? Way more versatile than I imagined, low enough to hear the bass, but not the fake boom you get with the stuff designed for ipods.If you love music but need to keep it down because of wife and kids.... get em."
5,CRISP!,"This is the best pair of headphones that I own. I use them when i study and also when I DJ when i forget my sony's. These are probably the best pair of headphones you can get for your money out there. Better then Beats, Sony, and Sein."
5,G.I. Joe Killaz rocks!,"If you like rap and G.I. Joe, you need to hear this! G.I. Joe Killaz features Destro and Baroness laying down mad rhymes with their laser gun rap attack!"
4,"pretty, but one was cracked",The glasses were beautiful but sadly one was chipped around the lip. Is there a way I can receive one replacement?
1,Worthless in Golf,"This game can only be watched, it CAN'T be played. There are NO ways to interrupt the game. It's a commercial for the Chrysler car company and a total waste of time and money. DON'T buy it!"
3,Not what it appears to be!,"These are not the original recordings. They are however, very good remakes made apparently in the 1970's. Davis's voice is much lower and soulful than on the originals. The music is in good taste hear. Cheap packaging though. Very little notes. No info about the versions of the songs that are present. Go for his ""Country Music Hall of Fame"" on MCA or the Bear Family Boxed sets. There has to be a reissue of his hits in the near future."
5,Jimmie Davis Greatest Hits CD,"I bought this CD of Jimmie Davis, because he has a great voice, has been forgotten by many, and I wanted to hear several songs on this CD again and again."
3,Sort of interesting,"Some of the essays were not that interesting in terms of learing or hearing something about the game. Not a great read, but if one likes to read about playing golf in winter or in bad weather in England/Scotland, this is for them."
5,Amazing testimony of Gods Grace in action,"The Story of Jacob Gartenhaus one that shows the grace of God in the life of a religious Jewish man. From the beginning, the story of Jacob reveals how the Lord brought this man to the place where he could be able to show his own people the truth of the Messiah. Although a controversial topic, the issue of sharing the Messiah Jesus with Jewish people is brought to life through the life of Jacob Gartenhaus. Anyone interested in seeing the hand of God bring a young man to America and then to confront him with Jesus will be excited as he finds the truth and the peace that comes with it. From the very beginning it is evident that the Lord is directing his path to establish IBJM and the Mission that is now directing efforts to millions of people."
5,Wood Plugs,"Product arrived quickly, secured in a small plastic pouch, and I was so pleased that I recently placed an additional order for a larger quantity."
4,This is a very well made and useful ...,"This is a very well made and useful product, and is much easier to use than most products made for incontinence. It absorbs well, and seems to be odor free. The only drawback is its cost. I wouldn't spend the money for this type of product when a similar solution can be had for a lot less but with a little more inconvenience."
4,The product is quite nice. I felt really ...,"The product is quite nice. I felt really comfortable using it. However, it could be improved by offering more specific size to fit various consumers. The ones I got are significantly larger than my actual size and it started to feel a little bulky. Another problem may come from the usage of this underwear with a light-fabric pant, which could be evident to others. Disposable underwear is good for wearing during traveling and camping outdoors."
1,Great dissapointment,"I was really looking forward to receiving this disk when ordered. I heard some reviews that the playing is too slow, but I like slow playing, so I didn't mind. Nevertheless, this is far too much even to me. I simply don't have the patient to wait for the next note. I even find it worse than Guillini, who plays this symphony much too slowly, but at least makes the Funeral March masterfully.I still adore Klemperer for his Mozart symphonies, for his Fidelio, and many more. (and I still think Guillini's recording of Beethoven's 7th is wonderful). But this is a complete disappointment."
3,God Will Understand...Close Friends and Family Might,"I'm on the late freight with this read.Didn't know Mr. Clark or this book existed until I joined FaceBook.Looking for new writers to read I stumbled upon this book with its powerful message.Its not how many friends you have,its the kind of friends that count.Two or three good ones that can keep you in check are worth more than 10 casual ones.The support of family is what helps us through tough times.This book of friends and family had regular everyday problems and secrets that Joe Blow or anybody you know might have but with the support and love of their friends and family they made it.Mr. Clark took us through ups and downs of people just trying to live life.He brought Anger...Happiness...Laughter...Sadness out of me as read this.Just wanted to let Mr. Clark know he did a good job.Looking forward to more of his work.3.25-3.50stars."
1,Save your money,"Everybody is trying to write the great American Novel. Again, another author has failed. I applaud this author's efforts but next time, try harder. If this book is in the library, get it from there, if not, save your money."
4,It is what it is,"Decent looking cover ... serious looking rather than fun, which is okay by me. This is by no means a ""sports"" or heavy activity type clip/cover, though; the cover, which is held closed by a magnet, tends to flop open while I'm mowing the lawn. For normal walking, etc., though, it's more than adequate. I would buy another one if something happened to this one."
3,It does its job,It will protect your Creative. Though the leather on the clip tares off and gives it a cheap look.
3,Ortiz Vs Shamrock,"I use to not like Tito Ortiz, but after watching these DVDS,I realized that he is an honorable person and one hell of a coach."
4,great product to bad I have to take it back. One of the disks is screwed up.,I love this show. I will reget the dvd set. Its Just too bad two set season 3 and season 2 both had skips in them.
2,How sad...,"A more unlikeable group of young men I doubt has ever been assembled. After watching T.U.F. seasons 1 and 2 and thoroughly enjoying them I was really looking forward to this one.Boy was I dissapointed. Granted some of the fights were good, but the fighters, with the exception of Josh Haynes, were just some really egotistical crybabys. And Tito and Ken Shamrock. WOW. Like little babies whining and getting in each others faces all the time like they were ready to kill one another, only to sit together in Dana's office the very next day oh so peaceably. LMFAO. What a couple of douches.There were as I stated before some decent fights and one sweet moment when trash-talking wannabe Solomon Hutcherson gets knocked out by Rory Singer. Team Dagger. Yeah right. Terrible coaches and coaching, moronic fighters just tooting there own horn for about 12 hours total, if thats your cup of tea, run out and pick up The Ultimate Fighter 3!"
1,Project ruined by this singer,"I don't care if this singer Jimmy Barnes is a legend or whatever in Australia. Man, this guy ruined the whole enterprise. His voice is utterly unbearable, ugly, boring, uninspired. annoying. He destroyed all the Ozzy songs and even the originals soudn worse live than the studio album (where his vocal work was already very weak).Putting Barnes along side the legends Morse, Kerslake, Daisley and Airey was a sin, a really bad musical decision.As for Morse totally changing Rhoads solos, it's alright for me. The trouble was: the solos simply are not great, not even close to inspired. For a guitarist of Morse's caliber,it hurts me to say that the solos he created for the Ozzy songs were a disappointment."
4,"Olivia fans, be on the lookout!!!",">If you're an Olivia Newton-John fan like I am, then you'll be just as excited as I am that this particular album is now available on CD. Her soft, lilting voice carries remarkably well on ""Shaking You"", a masterpiece, yet again, by David Foster. Other such notable artists on this album are Chicago and Boz Scaggs."
4,works but burns on pimples makes skin dry and itchy.,"I am a Clinique fan. Bought this after reading reviews on so many different sites. I had severe acne on my chicks and Joe line and didn't wanted to buy a whole skincare kit. After using this product for more than two months my acne are completely gone. But I still have dark spots left from acne scar. This products makes skin feel very dry and itchy. Also It burned quite a bit, when I applied it on pimples.I don't have experience with any other products for acne. So I will use it again and recommend it, But I will also try to find something better and cheaper."
1,Abridged Crap-ola,"The Original Album Has 11 Songs, This Re-Issue Only Has 8. I am going to wait until someone at Sun/Plantation decides to Reissue The Complete Album, Along With The Complete Albums of ""Yearbooks & Yesterdays"", ""Things Go Better With Love"", ""Country Girl"", ""Generation Gap"", & ""Jeannie"" (All By Jeannie C. Riley) Along With Dee Mullins' Album ""The Continuing Story of Harper Valley PTA"" and Harlow Wilcox's Albums ""Groovy Grubworm"" & ""Cripple Cricket"" On Compact Discs. How About A Box Set With All 6 Albums mentioned above by Jeannie C. Riley, Plus The Songs That Never Appeared On The Albums (Like The B-Sides to the hits), Alternate Takes (if any exist), etc. That Would Be A Great Start! (HINT, HINT) Until Then, I guess my LPs will have to do"
4,Where's the rest?,"I was hoping this was a complete reissue, but 3 tracks seem to be missing from the original album. ""The Cotton Patch"", ""The Little Town Square"", and ""Satan Place"". Still, an enjoyable campy country classic"
1,Glad I Still Have The Vinyl Recording,"This cd is missing 3 tracks. I wasn't paying attention when I bought it to recongnize that, nor did I read the customer reviews. Luckily, I recorded the original viyl LP on CD before I donated it, so I don't feel too bad about my faulty purchase."
2,Where Is The Whole Album?,I hope someone in the near future decides to re-issue the complete album with all eleven songs. I'll hold off buying this one for the time being and keep listening to my record.
5,Great headset for VOIP/Skype,"This headset finally fulfills my wishes after so many others have failed.Sennheiser is known for it's great sound quality. Note that if you want no noises from your surrounding at all, you might want to look for the more expensive noise cancelling headsets.This product is straight forward, good looking, light, comfortable and it doesn't break like all the other cheap headsets!Furthermore, I chose this since I had problems with the USB headsets when switchig under Vista between different USB devices for sound (micro & speakers and headset and webcam with micro). With the traditional 2 cinch like plugs everything works smooth, and I don't use up my USB ports in my laptop wich I might need for other USB devices. Of course, with non USB you can also use it with your sound system, your MP3 player and everywhere else.I recommend it!"
4,Red fox ecology,Interesting and well-written book about the ecology of foxes. Not for those looking for any historical information.
5,Intriguing History,"Edmund Nequatewa's telling of Hopi history is intriguing and readable. The title makes clear that this is one man's truth. The Hopi tribal structure is clan based and some accepted clan groups actually have a different language. Therefore, the stories told over a hundred generations properly vary from clan to clan. This book recounts the story of the Hopi as learned and understood by one man who appears to make no special claims for himself. That is refreshing. The book is rare in that it is authored by a Hopi, not a visiting anthropologist, however worthy that anthropologist might be. The text is clear yet written with some of the pattern used in Hopi speech. For me it has been a pleasure to read."
1,We Returned it!,Lund products are usually very nice and good accessories for trucks. I ordered this one for my husband as a Christmas present for use in a 2004 Full Size Dodge Pickup with a regular box.When the bar was extended to the right length for the width of our pickup it was flimsy and not very strong. The net was not meant to be utilized with the bar extended this far and was too tight to be used to hold anything.The chrome finish is very nice but hard to grab and hold onto to turn and adjust to remove or place in the box. Somehow I had the vision that there was a lever to release the tension but it was a push in the little buttons and turn type.This bar might work good in a SUV rear cargo compartment - like a Durango or Trail Blazer
2,Poor Quality And Be Careful,"Truthfully, the recording quality of this is poor. The vocal mix is terrible and the instruments seem to be in and out at times. If you are looking for a good quality DVD to see one of the best live bands of all time, this is not it. The guys also seem to be a bit tired and worn out. I also am only able to watch this DVD on my PC; my DVD player does not recognize it. This problem may be because of the PAL/Region 0 coding. I can't totally knock this DVD since any chance to see the Clash live is truly a blessing in itself. Sorry to have to report this."
1,Not the original recordings. Not the original Vogues.,"These are all re-recordings, made at Singleton Sound Studio in Nashville by one of the many imposter groups posing as the Vogues. Naturally, the packaging doesn't mention that these are not the original recordings or the original artists. Sun has marketed this disc with a budget retail price, hoping to lure unsuspecting consumers. Don't be fooled!"
1,Fake vogues,"Talent aside, these guys are not the original vogues. Not one of them were in the original group. There are at least 4 ""vogues"" groups out there today, besides the originals. Save your money for the real thing. The real Vogues were great and cannot be matched."
3,Awright!,"I enjoyed this CD. I liked the theme of the CD, and I really enjoyed the guest artists more than the main artist. The vocal styling of the main artist did not flow as smoothly as the guest artists. It takes more than a single listen of this CD to really feel its power."
1,Not worth the money spent,"This book was not what I thought, there should be more step by step pictures. I regret spending the money on it."
5,Having the Bible by your side.,"This is truly the Bible of Crocheting and it is always great to have it by your side while doing projects. I have crochet for years and sometimes you just forget how a stitch was to be done, I can look it up. Yes,it is truly a must have for all who crochet."
2,"Just ""Ok""!","I eagerly awaited this book by ""dummies"" hoping it would help me learn faster and with more understanding than some of the other books I had looked at.When it finally came out I was unfortunately disappointed. The entire book reads in a very unorganized way. They start explaining one thing and then go off on a tangent about something else. The stitch illustrations are not real clear for the beginner who is looking for close-up photos/pictures showing exactly where the hook should go.I have many ""how to crochet"" books(lets) and didn't feel the need to buy this book as it really didn't offer anything new that I already had and also seemed to just be a compilation of most of the other books out there, and a poorly organized compilation at that.You would do better to purchase a less expensive booklet to learn the basics."
1,Sorry I bought this book!!,"The illustrations are too confusing for someone who's never crocheted. You are first shown how to wrap the yarn around your hand and next you are told to make a loop resembling a pretzel but it shows the yarn coming directly off the ball. Also, why is there a chapter on blocking, measuring stitches and rows, etc., before you're even taught your first loop stitch."
3,I must really be a dummy,Too many words not enought pictures. I appreciate it's hard to do a book on something like this but I didn't find the simple things I was looking for (and thought I'd find in a dummies book). I'm sure if I persevere I'll get it right but maybe crocheting should be written like a cartoon not a novel.
2,Not for beginners,"The first books for dummies were great so I bought this book without any hesitation. The author is knowledgeable about the topic, but lacks the gift of explanation for beginners. I have since found the book Not your mama's crochet and am much happier with it. While I like the projects in the dummies book better, the explanation and pictures are better in the ""not your mama's"" book."
2,crocheting for dummies,the book is not very easy to understand. it is really complicated. it soen't have a simple step by step method that i expected it would have.
5,Very happy,Book very useful and well illustrated. Am a beginner in the art of crochet and find the diagrams easy to follow. Here's to crocheting!!
5,"If you want to learn to crochet, this book is PERFECT","After months of trying to teach myself to crochet off of youtube tutorials, and still not managing to make anything nice enough to allow to leave the house, I finally broke down and bought this book. Unlike a book that I had bought previously that pretty much seemed to be written in another language, this was really readable. Literally a week and a half later I was able to crochet things I am really proud of. I am considering opening an etsy shop now and crochet all the time. I tell all my friends and anyone else who wants to crochet to buy this book. It works!"
1,This ain't that bad but it ain't the original,"Just got this, not that bad, vocalist is a fair ghost of Danny Joe, and the band is fair as well, the guitarist is an excellent lead player, and the others compliment him, but they act like they are bored on stage. The CD live version is mixed very well, the Locked and Loaded CD was or had to be mixed in garbage can!Saw the original back in 79 opening for AC/DC, and if you put the original up against these guys, the original line up would chew them up and spit them out. I am glad that Molly is still keeping the music alive, but you just don't beat Danny Joe and his crew from back in the day.Cowboy Craig of Corpus Christi"
1,Molly Who?,"That is not the Hatchet that I once saw in New York opening for Boston. The performance is weak, there is only one original member, which is ok. But the lead vocalist is a wanna be, out of tune, he can't even whistle. Once thing is the guitar work is good, with two guitar, even thought the other guitar player hides in the back and very duet guitar happens. And the audience in Hamburg is not lie the one in USA. They are quite, and not enthusiastic. The singer wasted his voice screaming at the audience. Back to him, he can not sing the songs. Don't waste your money, but if you have never seen MH in concert and see some good southern rock music it's ok. The keyboard solo is worth it."
3,The New Molly Hatchet Band,"Short & Simple, If you are a real true careing Molly Hatchet Fan?,Then you will Enjoy this DVD,Even though Danny is no longer front and center?, His replacement is an excellant singer,and im sure if danny joe was with us today?,he would say if anyone fills my shoes while i'm in heaven,this man does a fine job for our devoted fans,So lets give Molly Hatchet a BIG THUMBS UP!!!,for continueing upward and onward for us loving devoted fans of them.Southern!! Rock!! Rises AGAIN!!Sincerly,Alan.C of DELAWARE."
3,Half baked,"The DVD is OK but the CD was a waste of time. Why leave out the last 3 full songs of the set, only to include the self indulgent instrumentals and solos?"
4,"Help for those unfamiliar with essay exams, UK","This book provides excellent advice for the person unfamiliar with the UK education system, examination by essay. It is very thorough and includes explanations related to note taking, organizing and revision before the exam as well as essay preparation. I wish I had it before my first series of exams in Great Britian. It would probably be useful also for those in other areas, where this kind of exam is required, certainly humanities majors. Covers the exam essay as a formal argument to answer a question as well as presenting advice on targeting the specific question."
4,A swashbuckling adventure,"I'm picky about romance novels, and this is the kind I like. It has all the right stuff--a sweeping, decades-spanning story of love lost and regained, cameos by historical figures, a compassionate hero, and a feisty heroine. It's the tale of Evan Carew, a fictional compatriot of the very real Francis Drake. Evan loses his first love to Spanish tyranny and finds happiness again with a courageous tomboy who carries a secret drop of royal blood. Fate and political machinations tear them apart---what will happen when they meet again?The only gripe I have about this book is that I wanted more! This is a long story, and parts of it seemed a little rushed,."
2,Boring,I love biographies about people in this time period but I found these people vapid and completely self centered and of very little interest.
2,A CLEVER PLOT - A JOKE,"I love UFO , as well as a lot the bands that have been sistematically ""tributed"" over the last years. But this kind of albuns stinks ! It's made only to gain some sort of quick money, it's a compilation. If you like a determined band, why on Earth to buy a record with other people playing it ?!! Just to sense a freshness to the music ? No, it's a waste of time."
2,Expected a little better!,"I purchased this item for my husband as a Xmas present and whilst I knew it was second hand and not in the greatest condition, I was rather shocked at how bad the condition was. I guess thats the lottery of buying second hand on line - it is difficult to quantify anything less than immaculate condition!!"
5,Great read,"One of the best WWII memoirs I have ever read, this coming from a reader who does not like""Flying Stories"". If an old friend had returned this book I'd have read it more than once."
1,"Disjointed, difficult read.",I don't understand all the hype about this book. It is trying to be 3 or 4 books at once. The most interesting strand is the memoir. That is sweet and reveals a life growing up around horses. But it also tries to be a poetry collection about horses and a quotable quote book about horses and a book of lilterary references to horses. I found all of those parts distracting and not very interesting. Not recommended.
1,She Doesn't fly,"I am not a ""horse person"" and only read this book because it was selected by my book club. I found it of little interest and was unable to make any connection with the author and her intimate relationship with horses. The style of inserting excerpts from literature, poetry etc in the middle of the text was distracting and made the text disjointed. Perhaps if one is a horse ""nut"" it would be of some interest but personally I couldn't relate and found all this emotional and spiritual attachment to horses quite annoying."
5,Mythology Metal,"Here's a band that you should pay some attention to. With power metal bands now a dime a dozen, and most of them [junky], Virgin Steele have something. This is the kind of sound I look for in many power metal bands, but usually end up disappointed with. I'm not saying they're the best of the best, but they certainly hold their own. It's similar to Rhapsody but without the extreme cheesiness(unlike Rhapsody, you could feel half way comfortable playing this in front of friends). Virgin Steele has the whole narration bit to pull the story along, but it fits well. Unlike Rhapsody, you don't have to turn the narration parts down or fast forward in fear someone will hear it. Even though it's metal, it's surprisingly soothing(for me anyway). I really like the vocals too. And I've always been a mythology fan."
5,One Hellacious Metal Opus,"I was in VIRGIN stacking up on Power-Metal CDS and saw VIRGIN STEELE'S ""House of Atreus Act 2"" marked down to $8.99, so I checked the first song on the store's CD sampler...and immediately threw ALL the other CDS away, and bought HOUSE OF ATREUS.THIS is one amazing rock opera. Bold, classy, well-researched (based on the legends of Orestes, son of Agamemnon) with excellent lyrics and instrumentality. It's up there with Manowar's TRIUMPH OF STEEL, but Manowar is a bit heavier than Virgin Steele. The reason being Virgin Steele is a trio, and David DeFeis is principally a keyboardist. Even so, THE HOUSE OF ATREUS kicks ass in classical power-metal style with the keyboards adding flair and class to the album, not detracting from it. DeFeis also has a great voice and writes excellent metal lyrics. All Manowar fans and power metal fans in general should check out Virgin Steele!"
5,sexcats makes me sizzle!,Its a great collection of vintage erotic photographs........ Unlike anything available now days. Buy this book if not for the nude ladies....then for the photography art!!!
1,A waste of a tree,"Aesthetically sub-mediocre, this volume doesn't even succeed as kitsch. Turn to Rod Ashford's ""Erotique"" for an exponentially superior survey of vintage erotic photography."
4,Bargain player,"I'd love to buy another for $26, but they're out of stock... probably permanently. It has more features (e.g. backlighting) than a sony I bought at twice the price."
4,Good but not stand-alone,"I've been planning my wedding for the past few months and I've been relying on this book, Easy Wedding Planning Plus by Elizabeth and Alex Lluch, and Bridal Bargains by Denise and Alex Fields. This book covers all the etiquette questions that crop up when planning a wedding (who are you supposed to buy gifts for, who is expected to pay for what, etc.) It also offers a tremendous amount of other information such as tips for saving money, things to think about when selecting flowers, music, etc. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it won't stand alone. I used the planning book to really keep everything organized, and the budget book offered a lot more specific advice on saving money (specific vendors, websites, etc.)"
1,Nothing to learn here,"If you happen to own an older edition of Emily Post and ever cared to look through it, then you could have penned this yourself. I hoped for a traditional guide from which I could choose how to modernize. However, the modernized Emily Post offers little in the way of rules and etiquette and confirms that anything goes. If you care about etiquette, there is nothing to learn here."
2,outdated,I am a traditionalist but found no help from this book - there were so many options that there were no 'real etiquette' answers
2,Book,"No, I would tell people to purchase. I thought that this wouldbe different. I like the other books that I purchased better."
1,Panic in the wedding aisle!,"Yikes! I am newly engaged, and this book scared the bejebbers out of me! My fiance and I were looking at a simple wedding. This book intends to scare you into looking at more and more elaborate proceedings. Finally, you are at the point where you believe no one but a diety called a ""wedding planner"" can actually pull off a wedding.Perhaps it is where I live and my social-economic class, but this book view of etiquette is manners that quickly translates into cash. I literally woke up in the middle of the night when I considered how much everything would cost and how far behind the wedding planning was.My friends who are married knew what sort of wedding I had in mind and did not hestitate to tell me to send the book BACK."
3,A fairly good book,"This book is marvelous help in preparing for your wedding day, laying out all the physical aspects of the wedding from A to Z. Sadly, this book doesn't have much discussion on preparing your heart for the day. It is said that a woman looks forward to her wedding day, a man looks forward to the wedding night - both are important, but men often tend to downplay the day's events as they focus on the evening...."
4,Excellent Resource - for Traditional Weddings,"This book has been a very good resource for our wedding. However, I have found it lacking in a few areas. It does not have any information on destination weddings. I was also a little disappointed to not find a section on how to tastefully handle a departed parent.Overall, this is the best book I have found on the topic of wedding ettiquette and it meshes nicely with Emily Post's Etiquette."
1,Disappointing,"I'm getting married in a couple of years, and I already had Emily Post's 16e book on general etiquette, so I thought it would be good to get the full scope of weddings with this book. I feel really stupid for that now, because the book is small, doesn't contain most of the information that the general etiquette book has on weddings, and therefore isn't something you can use separately anyway. It's completely lacking on information, and so if you have to choose between getting this book or getting the general one and having some extra information about other things, get the general one and save some money.Emily Post's Etiquette, 17th Edition (Thumb Indexed)"
3,BOYS WILL BE BOYS ?,"How much trouble can two young bored boys get into ? HOW MUCH STUFF IS IN THE BARN? WELL, THAT'S A LOT. MOMMA DIDN'T FAINT FOR NOTHING? CAN YOU MAKE AN INVENTION FROM THE ITEMS IN YOUR FATHER'S BARN ? These boys made a mess and an.........sorry !!!!!"
1,Zionist Propaganda,"Completely unsubstantiated and false claims geared towards the Neo-Con and Zionist audience. There's much more truth to the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" than this piece of work.The author, Ilan Berman, is a Vice President for Policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, a Zionist organization in bed with the ""Israel-first"" AIPAC lobby in Washington, DC.If you want to read literature authored by otherwise intellectually honest and gutsy Jewish authors check out any of Noam Chomsky's books or Norman G. Finkelstein's ""The Holocaust Industry"".A complete waste of time and devoid of intellectual honesty that contributes to the seeds of war and misunderstanding. Enough American youth have been sacrificed at the altar of Zionism/Israel."
4,Already risen too high,"Ilan Berman has written a succinct description of the reasons why a nuclear Iran is unthinkable. Iran, he tells us, is far more involved in the exportation of the Revolution(terrorist activities) than most of us are probably aware of. For example, Iran has equipped Hezbollah with an enormous number of powerful weapons including missiles. He concludes however that the surgical strike option is untenable and lists the imagined repercussions other agencies have listed. He prefers beefign up our Voice of America with news rather than music (a good idea). He says that it isn't too late for diplomacy because Iran won't have its first nuclear weapon until at least 2006. I did a quick check of the publishing date and saw that it read 2005, but guess he wrote it in 2004. He left me believing that despite his ruling out a Surgical Strike, we'd better rule it back in if a Nuclear Iran is truly unthinkable."
4,Great item but it doesn't hold all CD/DVDs,"This is an automated CD/DVD finder. Plug it into your computer through a USB port and use the supplied software to select a CD/DVD. Within about 3 seconds, the CD/DVD pops out of the Library. You can hook a myriad of these togther. Each of these holds 150 DVDs. The concept is great, the software is ok.The problem I had with this was that I have some burnt DVDs that don't fit in here. These burnt DVDs do not fit because I applied a thin printed CD/DVD label on them (using CD Stomper). I had to force the CDs/DVDs into their slots, and when it cames time for the machine to push them out, it wasn't able to. The machine will find the CD and just sit there waiting for you to pull it out.Still a great buy."
4,CD/DVD Storage and Retrieving System,"The ""CD Library (DC-101)"" is a CD/DVD storing and retrieving system. The unit can hold up to 150 discs and has the capability to be controlled by your PC using the USB interface or it can be used manually. The supplied software has the functionality that allows you to create a database that can be searched in multiple ways.I had no difficulty installing the software and within a few minutes, I was up and running.Features:-Single or multiple unit installation (one computer can connect up to 127 machines, which equates to 19050 CDs/DVD)-Unit can be physically locked-Library softwareRequirements:-Intel or compatible Pentium 166 or higher-64 MB of RAM or higher-20 MB of free disk space-CD ROM Drive-Available USB port-Windows 98SE, ME, 200 Professional, XP"
4,Thank God they out of No Limit,"All I gotta say is that, I'm glad that these guys are out of No Limit. I think Master P. made a bad mistake by releasing them. These guys are pretty good rappers, but Beats by the Pound made em sound corny. The beats on this album are 10x better then what your accustomed to. I think this album is better than any new No Limit alubm out. Kane and Abel put it down. These catz is hott. A jump off from Rise to Power which is also hott. I didn't know Mr-Serv On was that good. His track is probably the hottest. The beat is tight, the production was tight. His lyrics were nice, so overall that track was blazin. Mystikal comes in crazy as usual. Handle Ya Business was pretty good. I like dis album overall, but still it doesn't get a 5 star cause it isn't that great. If your a fan of Mystikal, nice beatz, and gangsts rap this is a ""MUST GET"". If your a fan of No Limit, get this album anyway."
2,This is what's left of Carla Bley's catalogue?,"Carla Bley has made some incredible music over the last thirty years, most of it for ECM. This album is NOT her best one and the only U.S. domestic release the bean-counters at BMG (the ""parent"" label---HAH!) decided to leave in print. The best you can say about this one is that her sense of humor--always in large supply with Carla Bley--is quite evident here. But it doesn't even begin to show off how deft a composer she is or how sweeping, elegant and FUN her band arrangements can be. Whoever made this ill-conceived cost-cutting descision should be ashamed of themselves!"
5,Great Lipstick Box for Remnant Pieces of Lip Sticks !!!,"This is a great lipstick box to put your pieces of remnant lip sticks inside and you'll be able to quickly open the box and mix and match whatever colors you want to put on. This was the best priced palette kit I had come across on the internet, because most cosmetic companies like ""Sephora"" or ""Bobbi Brown"" charge much more for their palette boxes."
3,Does the job,Tiny palatte but holds a lot of product. I use this for my lipsticks and keep in my makeup kit. Makes it a lot easier to pick colors when working on my clients.
5,A winning book,"Elizabeth Laird is a prize winning author who has written acclaimed novels of children in many areas of the world. In A Little Piece of Ground, Laird gives the reader a picture of life in Israeli occupied Ramallah. Through the eyes of Karim, a young Palestinian who wants to grow up in freedom and to have a little piece of ground for a soccer field, we see the horrors of the occupation and discover how the ongoing brutal occupation fuels the anger of Palestinians. This book is a MUST read for those who want to see and get a better understanding of the side that is not usually portrayed in our media.Although this book has been printed in UK it has, until now, unlike Laird's other works, not been available in the US due to the subject matter. I am pleased that Amazon is offering this important book."
5,A story that touches the heart,"First of all, this wonderful touching book, educated me about what is going on in Ramallah, Palestine. I felt the suffering, fear and oppression felt by all the occupied people, especially the children. How do you explain what is going on,and make them understand how unjust, illegal this occupation is by the Israelis? The story of the lads, clearing a very small area, so that they could play soccer, to have some fun, and do what young lads want to do. Elizabeth Laird has certainly captured me with her story, this should be rquired reading for everyone"
5,Fantastic!,"Great album. I don't know why they weren't more popular. Each song is accompanied with tons of energy and it's a great way to get pumped up. My favorite tracks include Evil Robots, Gotta Give it To Me, and Dressed Up (interesting vocal style)!"
3,It's an okay filler movie.,"I liked it well enough, but it absolutely felt like a link between RE: Apocalypse and the final film in the series. The action sequences were fun. The writing and direction leave a lot to be desired, especially in regards to characterization.It's a fun flick to pick up and watch for the action. Don't expect much else."
4,great movie,"Lots of action, great effects. I liked the whole Resident Evil series and now own them all on Blu-Ray Disc. Crystal clear picture and the Lossless sound is mind blowing. If you like Action- Science-Fiction you will like this."
4,Good Sequel,"This is part 3 of the Resident Evil The movie takes place years after the first left off. The t-virus has spread all over the earth, infecting most of the world's population.The thing I liked most about this movie when comparing it to parts 1 and 2 is the apocalytic theme. In parts 1 and 2 the virus had not caused such a widespread pandemic yet. In Extinction, the whole planet is affected.I do feel that the story could have been a little better, but the visual effects and battle scenes were very good."
5,Horrorrivically good,This is a great zombie movie. i love this movie and so will you. I recommend this movie to everyone
3,Meh.,"This review refers only to the content of the film itself, not the DVD. The Resident Evil series draws to a well-deserved close. This is much better than the second film, but not as good or scary as the original. Although the ending is kind of clever, and Milla is her usual hard-fightin' high-kickin' quick-drawin' self, this is for series completists only. Casual fans need not bother."
3,Could Have Been Much Better,"I enjoyed the other two films in this series to some extent, and I even liked this one quite a bit, but the dialogue and lack of plot were beyond bad. Milla was hot and fun to watch as always, but everyone else I could care less about. The storyline didn't really progress much and it looks like the fourth film in the series will be on its way in a couple of years. Not bad, but worth waiting to rent on DVD."
2,A couple of decent action sequences don't save this terrible film...,"This movie is bad - so bad, in fact, that I would rather it hadn't been made.In lue of this travesty of film-making, watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse on TV... Every time Mike Epps' ""L.J."" is supposed to say M*** F***, they dub him saying ""Motivator."" It makes the movie_at least_57 times better. (Which is 946 times better than 'Resident Evil: Extinction.') ^_^"
1,When there is no room in Hell Worthless Movies will walk the Earth!,"WARNING: This might just be the most Negative Review you'll read all Year!!!The plot line to this Garbage (some might call a Movie?!?) is simple take George A. Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD script urinate all over it! Add elements of Both Alfred Hitchcocks's The Birds & The Road Warrior then you have this Unbearable piece of film.Paul W.S. Anderson is: (A) One of the best Pitch-Men in LA,(B) Pimping out his wife (Who happens to be the Lead) Can you say the word of the day: NEPOTISM(C)Black mailing Executives @ Screen Gems/Sony with some crazy photos!The Fact is every Print of this film should be Buried in a land fill along side those old Atari2600 ET Games!1/10WORTHLESS (adj.) 1. Lacking all worth and value. 2. Having no useful purpose"
1,"Pathetic, silly acting. Especially from the 'women warriors""","This is one of those movie series in which it becomes progressively worse with each installment. Not much I can say, but the women are atypical stereotypes of the aggressive females; long on angst and short on acting skills. Laughable plots and more laughable are the actors trying to reach out ""acting"". If you like sci-fi action flicks (there are boring sequences), this is pretty good. But don't ever expect Oscar performances in these movies. I guess no one really does."
1,Review of this Service buy but no rent,"Well I have been waiting for this movie to come out so that I can download it and watch it. I want to rent it however, not buy a file that I may not be able to use at a latter time, so I am immensely frustrated that I will not be able to circumvent the brick and morter store, which by the way is out. I understand that this is a place for reviewing the movie, but I am annoyed at the Sell but no Rent option.!!-R-"
1,Pathetic,"One star because I cannot give it no stars.A feeble excuse to move from one fight/shooting/zombie scene to the next. No plot. No story. No excuse.The laziest excuse for a movie I have seen in a long, long time."
4,No Surprises,"As usual, the product came on time and worked as expected. I am a great fan of Mila and enjoy everything she makes. Looking forward to the next movie."
3,poor quality,"I sent a review to the amazon instant video dept. re: this. and it seems my new smart tv needs better download speed. The movie itself was ok, in that it seems like you end up in the same place over and over and over. 'Can't wait to see some headway in the series."
3,Get what you expect,"Pretty much exactly what weve come to expect from a Resident Evil movie. Its not great, but its not bad, and its got plenty of undead trying to eat people, whats not to enjoy?"
1,Mila's face!,"I have to go one star on this.First off, there was no story whatsoever. And consider - Im a fan of the previous two movies. I know sometimes people say the plot sucked, or was virtually nonexistent in a movie. But in this movie, the plot wasnt virtually nonexistent, there absolutely was no plot at all. The movie was just a series of scenes loosely connected together.Speaking of which, I counted at least 5 scenes that were direct rip offs of much better movies. Did they think no one would notice they just pulled the ""bob"" scene directly out of Romero's film? Its like the movie was written by committee - or a 12 year old. Maybe a committee of 12 year olds?Oh, and lastly, what in the world did they do to Milla's face? She was CGI'd the whole movie - and it looked ridiculous. They had one of the most beautiful women on film, and then turn her face into a bizarre photochop experiment? I really really hope this isnt the future of films, she looked like a freak.In a word. Awful."
1,"Now she can burn birds...with a thought, it cant get anyworse.","First she could make your nose bleed with a thought(apocalypse), now she uses her powers to burn birds. And apparently she can be turned on and off with a switch. This one is longer and more boring, and the clones at the end, that was even worse. This is not resident evil, this is a bad mix between mad max and whatever they could think of. Milla is a good actress, but this Alice character is more robot than human. 28 weeks later and Warning sign are better than this one."
2,Resident Evil & Resident Evil Apocalypse were much better,"Resident Evil Extinction was ok, I'd watch it again, but I would have to be really bored to do so. It took too long for the action to start and once it did, there not enough of it. I'm also not a big fan of one the actors that played in this installment but thank goodness that person had a small part.Resident Evil and Resident Evil Apocalypse were much better. I'd highly recommend those two movies. Sometimes it's best to quit while you're a head and that is what they should have done."
3,Why did I watch this movie?,"I thought this movie might be good, but I found that it was mainly just some action sequences with some zombies. The killing gets mundane and quite uninteresting. Some items in the plot didn't make sense, so what I did was get all the parts in the resident evil series, and then watch them all. Now I am asking myself, why did I waste my time with this movie? Why did I waste my time with getting the whole series?If you're a fan of the video game, you might like this movie, otherwise, I suggest skipping on it."
3,"Not bad, not good","This series has reached mediocre. Maybe there will be a fourth to pull it out of the rut it is headed for now. The acting, effects, and music are good. The story on the other hand lacked something to give it that edginess the first two movies had. Cloning our hero or making the big bad Umbrella guy a monster didn't seem surprising. A couple good scenes including one that you will say looked like it came right out of ""The Birds"" will make you perk up and say, now that was cool. In fact had they pursued more wildlife gone bad it probably would have made a better overall movie. I didn't mind that it borrowed from ""Road Warrior"", ""The Birds"", and ""Coma"", it just needed a better overall theme. That and it upset me they killed off two characters from the last movie that I thought should have survived this nightmare. Good quality DVD and fair replayability."
2,.... Rent it....,"I love the first Resident Evil. The second one is ok. This one is the worst one for me. There are some good action scenes, but nothing new or interesting. It's quite boring I think. If you're thinking about buying it, think twice. Rent it first."
3,it was good but not great,"The movie should have been at night,in the bird seen. part one was better.i wanted more from the movie"
3,Good thing its finally ended...,"1st one was great, 2nd one was ok. This one was eh.The story is good, but very short, it doesn't really go anywhere, and there is not enough fighting with the bad guy at the end. Overall, it was pretty mediocre, but I still liked it enough to keep it.Update... probably will sell it as I doubt I will watch it again... I haven't not opened again since I got it."
4,I liked this. Seems a lot of people didn't.,"Wow. It's not been long since this thing came out and it's already down to $3 as of this writing. That's real cheap real fast. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I loved the first one. That one was great and I've probably watched it six or seven times. The second, not so much. That one was garbage. I think this one is good. Erase APOCOLYPSE from the trilogy and go with the other two movies and you got a good set. I recommend this myself. I thought it was a pretty good movie."
4,I am a sucker for zombie movies!,"I had very low expectations for this film, especially after Apocalypse (I really liked the first one however). I am a sucker for zombie movies and I found this film to be much more involving than I thought. It was cleverly tied to the other two movies and has momentum and action with a fairly twisty ending. Overall: GOOD! (remember it is a zombie movie afterall!)."
3,Not the best in the series,"I rather enjoyed the first 2 installments of this movie trilogy. This one, while not bad, still didn't quite live up to the others. The story was much weaker, and the special effects, for the most part, I found to be over done. Over all, the character development was lacking. Unless you want it to complete the collection, I'd wait for it to come out on cable, or just borrow it from a friend. It's probably worth your time to watch, but I'm not sure if it's worth your money."
5,"My first Unbox Download, (R.E.: Extinction), is a Hit!!","I've never played the games, and I missed Apocalypse, but I thoroughly enjoyed Extinction. I don't know, but I've been a Mila Jovovich fan ever since The 5th Element. Although a little short on story, maybe because it's been carried through 3 movies, but it definitely makes up for it in action.I agree with the ""Stop rating the unbox service"" review. Please only review the movie at hand. I had no problem downloading this movie on the 7th of Jan., 08, so I can't fathom what problems others have experienced. I also liked that I could start watching the movie before the download was finished, and it worked flawlessly, my movie wasn't ever interrupted, (however, people with different Internet connection may have a different experience). ***** for Unbox."
3,Not Bad and a little different...,"Ok so this wasnt my favorite addition to the collection but I liked it none the less. Its a little less action packed as the last two. It has its slow/quiet moments. I like it because, as crazy as it is, you get some more background and info about the main character. BUT what I liked the most besides the great graphics and make up was that they are trying to be different. Lets face it you can only tell a zombie movie so many ways and I like the fact that they arent sticking to the whole creepy mansion or abandoned buidling thing. If you are a fan I think you will appreciate what they have done whether or not it hit the 'scary' mark. I have a feeling that we will see them in a much different environment in the next movie (Alaska?). I like the fact they are changing it up a bit. I love Mia and overall the movie was pretty good. If you are a Resident Evil or zombie movie fan you will like this movie."
3,can get subtitles off? the off feature dont work in my players?,"very annoying subtitles mixed with commentary subtitles?maybe my disk was made wrong hummmm? i cant turn off the subtitles other than that it was ok movie, no milla jovovich commentary? i wish there was! she's funny..."
3,Still watchable,"This is still a watchable film, and it entertains. Much of these ideas have been done before. We have govt experiments gone disasterously wrong, the world laid waste like a mad max movie, throw in zombies, zombie animals, warrior babe, Tk abilities, mad scientists, mad scientist run amok, bloody gore, cloning, world revelations, mix this all in a pot set to boil, and you have a movie! Not terribly original, but entertaining none the less"
3,"An improvement over Apocalypse, but not as good as the original","The t-virus has spread across the world, turning not only zombies into humans, but every animal species. Alice is leading a nomadic life, searching for the secret bolthole of the Umbrella Corporation. Together with a small band of survivors, she attempts to penetrate the bolthole, where stashes of the anti-virus are held. But inside Project Alice and Project Nemesis are there to stop them. A great improvement over Resident Evil Apocalypse, with a stronger plot and greater social commentary, but it still doesn't rise to the level of the original. Which is a shame; there are many facets that could have been explored further, such as the true reason the t-virus exists, and the humanity of the post-human creatures Umbrella has spawned. Still, it's an enjoyable installment in the Resident Evil series."
3,Time for a good movie series to end,"Although hardcore fans of the Resident Evil video game have complained about this movie series from the beginning, I gave the first two (2) Resident Evil movies very high marks for being a good modernized variation on the whole Zombie genre.With this third installment, I must now say it looks like it is time to end the series.This third movie seemed less like Resident Evil and more like a combined tribute or ""homage"" to ...Road WarriorThe BirdsDay of the DeadMatrixand The Sixth Day.... all wrapped into one.This film seemed to have a hard time finding it's center and just seemed like a mish-mash of random elements tossed in to give Alice an excuse to overuse her two curved battle swords.I bought the first two Resident Evil movies on DVD for our collection, but we have no plans to order this 3rd film.We would never care to watch it again.It was pretty flat."
3,Pretty Good!,"I'm not familiar with the games, nor have I seen the first two, but I rather enjoyed this one nonetheless! Pretty good sfx, action and the acting overall was decent. An exciting and fun sci-fi action adventure overall. I'm actually looking forward to the next one!"
4,It's good not great,"Wow, there are some people just complaining about download issues. I haven't had an issue yet. Chances are it's either your computer or it might just need to be reinstalled because my Unbox works great. As for the movie, it's fun to watch once but I think the die hard zombie fans will buy it. I was disappointed ONLY because the series strayed away from the horror part of it all which is what I LOVED about the 1st game. I was hoping the horror would be as present in the movies but it just wasn't there. Good action, parts that make you jump. I say it's worth a watch once."
3,The best of the three,The first two movies only deserve 1 star. This one should get a 3. It's a big improvement but far from perfect or even what a Resident Evil movie should be. It's light on the horror and suspense and heavy on the cheese. Everything from the costumes to the dialog is just so cheesy that it ruins any kind of terror you might experience in one of the games. I think Silent Hill got it right in it's film adaptation. It was more on the dark and creepy side while this is more bright and almost a comedy.
3,Not a great movie!,"As i sit and watched this movie, i can say that i got into it when it started all the way till almost the ending and then..it just got stupid in my view. It has a lot of ""zombie"" action than the 2nd movie, but, the ending was just too dumb and can someone tell me why does Milla have to be nude in every film she does??...Anyways, its an ""OK"" film, but, wasn't worth the $8 at the movies thats for sure. Buy this film if only your a Resident Evil fan, however, if your looking to buy the film cause you had not seen it yet...Rent it first..it'll save you the money!. Rental movie only!!!"
2,Could have been better,"The one thing I can honsetly say that I did not like was not getting an explanation for what happened during Alice's time with the Umbrella Corporation.Also the notable absence of Jill Valentine or Angela, the doctor's daughter.All in all the movie wasn't bad,but it seems to leave more questions than answers.I would have liked to have seen Alice's powers progress more seeing that in the last movie she was taken away to a facility where she could master them better.Still,it was a good sci-fi horror action movie."
3,Resident Evil,"Not as good as the first two Resident Evil movies, but entertaining. If you liked the first two you will like this one, and if you haven't seen the first two start with those first before you watch this one."
5,This was a great movie,"I enjoyed all the resident evil movies there were great, so this was a great movie, resident evil degeneration is comeing out, but this was a great movie."
3,DVD was choppy,I was watching it with my cousin. The movie was getting good until the movie got choppy. I had to forward almost to the ending. I never had this problem with a dvd before.
3,Good action and special effects. Worth renting.,This movie contains good action and special effects. There's nothing new about the plot. It's worth renting.
5,AWESOME,Awesome movie... I thought it would be the third and final one... Like the rest this one will be watching this one over and over again... Be sure of that....
3,Worth watching,It's worth watching if you are a fan of the series or Milla Jovovich.Lots of action too and keeps your interest but it's a bit weaker inplot and big budget effects than the first two movies.Zombies in the desert..lots of it seems similar to a Romero film..maybe Day of the Dead?It's still fun but has all been seen before..
4,"Great, but for the hardcore.","This is one of those movies that can be described as awesome, and it really is. The point here is that you really have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy it. Being the third chapter in the series, it's important to have previous knowledge of the story; although, in this one, sereval changes can be found. The dark landscapes of Raccoon City and the interiors of certain buildings are exchanged for open and enormous settings in a ruined Las Vegas, and in daylight!! It's important to say that this is not a trilogy, the final sequence is an open door for the next film.The prettiest thing is to see the lovely Milla Jovovich doing her stuff; and of course, in glorious HD, is a poem for the sight.Highly recommendable for Resident Evil fans."
5,Great addition for my umd collection,I already owned the dvd of the movie so rather than invest in a portable dvd player i bought resident evil: extinction. Great product to finish off my other two rsident evil movies on psp.
1,Did not play,"DVD did not play nor was the beginning in English. You get what you pay for, I payed for crap and I got crap."
2,Lame!,"What a missed opportunity one just about every level. After the first film (which was just OK) then the second, which is my favorite in the series, but still not a great flick, comes Resident Evil: Extinction. It's completely un-entertaining, if fact a stupid film. Zombies in jump suites using kung fu....give me a break!!!"
4,Great movie.,"This is the best one yet. Alice has more powers which came in handy. Well, its some what predictable you know like there being zombies all over and the good guys having to fight back. The ending was great though. There being hundreds of clones makes me wonder what will the next movie be like. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to people who liked the first two movies."
2,meh,"i really liked the first resident evil and the second was ok, but not the worst movie i'd ever seen. this one was worse than the second...but again, not the worst movie i've ever seen. the action was really good and bloody, but the story was just terrible and the final fight was SUPER lame. the only reason i didn't completely hate the film was that i saw it for free with a coupon that came with the resident evil two pack. if i'd had to pay to see it, i would have been very upset. however, like a sucker i will probably go to the theater to see the next installment, if it is ever made. by the way, the worst movie ever is ""the core"""
2,Zombie film,Lame third Resident Evil film with a horde of zombies. And false advertising- no skin? I would not recommend it.
2,what happened,idk what happened after the second one but i sure dropped in quality this one just plain out wasnt that good
4,Odd,Guys its hard to believe so many are so dissappointed with unbox when I have had great luck using it. One of my rented downloads would not play in the unbox player so I emailed amazon cust service and they got back with me the next day with a link to a win media player hot fix that worked. I have always been very impressed with amazon experiance. Good Luck (-:
3,mixed review,"The blu-ray version of this movie was outstanding, very good picture and sound (not quite avatar which I believe to be as good as it gets but in the upper echelon and really well done). The movie itself is a huge letdown compared to the first 2 in the series, story, sub plots and even umbrella lost it's bang. Hopefully they will rebound with the next one.Blu-ray video 4.5 starsblu-ray audio 4.5 starsmovie itself - 2 stars"
2,Starts becoming less a zombie film and more a B-grade magic show,"Resident evil originated from a survival horror video game, where unlike a first person shooter, the emphasis was on conservation of ammo, and puzzle solving.As the series progressed, say by RE Code Veronica, the creature designs got more and more interesting and the plots more enveloping.So did this translate to the last movie adaption?Instead we get a bizarre decision to make our main character Mila (who is hot at least) to develop increasingly powerful psychic abilities. Abilities that allow her to essentially destroy any number of baddies with a grimace.You don't need to have a literary degree to know that giving your good guy all the superpowers doesn't make for good movie watching."
1,still says pre-order.,"If you interested in watching this movie via download, you will have to wait just like me. As of Jan 2 08 Unbox has not made this available for download. I have preordered the movie and have not been able to download it yet. I hope its worth the wait. Happy New Year.."
1,I wish this movie would become extinct.,"These movies have been very bad and are to be listed as ""unhealthy Cult Entertainment"". The director of this movie would not know a good script or cast if he saw one. Everyone looks clueless and wooden in the parts, and Milla Jovovich should find better movie roles to do then this. That is if Hollywood ever sends her a good script to begin with."
3,Not as great as the first two.,"I didn't really enjoy this one as much as I did one, two, and four. I really wasn't blown away by anything in this movie, and I don't think the desert setting helped out to much either, though the zombies were pretty nasty looking. Two stars for the zombies and a extra star for having MikE Epps back."
2,Extintion is Extint!! Boring!!! Big Disappointment :-(,"BORING !!!Big disappointment !!!Nothing like the other two, this third try should have been GREAT!!But it is a serious FLOP !Extintion is EXTINCT!If you have time to waste on a movie, then RENT do not buy, better yet borrow from a friend - they probably won't want it back either."
2,not great,this movie was a little on the corny side to me! the only thing i liked about this movie is how all of the original characters from part two all died! other then that............i wish i could get my money back from the movie ticket!
4,Replacement battery for VTech cordless phone works fine,The product arrived in fully working order and completely consistent with how it was represented online. The price was very attractive.
2,Slow Shipping,"The item description states it's a Vtech replacement battery. It was not A Vtech battery, rather a no name battery. Aslo, the shipping was super sloooooooooooooooow. It took over a month from the date I made the purchase."
1,Ridiculous shipping charge!,"I wanted to order this product, but the ""standard"" shipping charge for four of them is almost $17.00! Good price on the batteries, but adding in the shipping makes them just too expensive."
3,battery hold charge is average,I bought this product to replace the existing batteries in my wireless hand sets. When the phones were new I could get 2 weeks between charges. As the batteries became used I would get 1 hour between charges. So I bought these replacement batteries. I recieved them quickly within the week. I had 2 with a charge and 1 dead on arrival. I charged the DOA for 24 hours and it held the charge for 3 days. The others I ran down for 1 day and then recharged. They get 3 days with their charges also. 3 days is better than an hour but a far cry from 2 weeks.
3,Quick shipping,The shipping was quick. I received the order just a couple of days after I placed the order.The battery is working fine. But its capacity is not as high as the others I used before. I need to charge the battery more frequently.
5,Batteries work great & such a lifesaver!,"We have 3 V-tech phones, all of which are about 5 1/2 years old. Two of phones batteries died and I knew we had to find more soon or just buy new phones. I had purchased one or two batteries off of ebay about a year or so ago, they didn't last long at all and not worth bothering with. These batteries worked instantly when I put them in the phones and the price is great too as compared to buy all new phones. I will be coming back to buy another for the third phone when that one dies too."
4,Satisfied with our purchase,"These batteries are for our cordless land line phones. They seem to last about a year. We do not use the phone often. But when we do, we use the speaker, which seems to drain the battery faster. I have found these online at about 100 different prices and Amazon seems to have the best. I trust Amazon. I don't know if a higher priced battery would last longer. But at the price, I feel they are adequate. I am not sure if I always get the same seller, but I have never been disappointed or had any problems. I will continue to order from Amazon when we need batteries. Or anything else, as far as that goes!"
4,Great but shipping is outrageous,"I ordered four of these replacement batteries and they came as promised and work great so far (had them in about 3 weeks) so I guess I can't speak with authority on the battery life but no reason to think they won't last. The only issue I had with this order is the ridiculous shipping and ""handling"" amount. I believe it was over $10 for something that came in a little cardboard mailer that could not have weighed more than half a pound. It also took well over a week to receive them. For $10, I should have had them in a couple of days! Even with the shipping price, they were the best deal on the internet and do work just fine, which is most important!"
5,Works!,I bought 4 of these for my phone set. They were inexpensive and work great. They came with a charge in them. The only small complaint is that the wiring is a little longer so you have to bend and fiddle with it just a little to get the battery cover back on.
5,Working as advertised,Batteries arrived in a timely manner and are working as advertised. I would buy from this seller again.
5,This a story of love and respect for human kind.,"After reading this beautiful book, it stayed with me for days. I laughed, cried, and shuddered (see Riding the Light Rail vignette, page 64) but couldn't put it down. David's struggle with Alzheimer's validates my own mother's story and the challenges we had in finding good care for her. Even the title connected with me. My mother loved to dance and one of the dearest memories I have toward the end was dancing with her in the kitchen of the group home to ""String of Pearls."" How blessed David was to have Marilyn in this part of his life, and how blessed I feel having read their experience. What a gift she has for being so perceptive and seeing such love and beauty in human kind. Thank you Marilyn Mitchell for sharing that gift!"
5,Joyously Enlightening,"I have had the distinct pleasure of personally meeting with Betty Crowson and attending her spiritual workshops ,prior to reading her profoundly life altering book. The Joy is in the Journey is spiritually driven along with providing authentic tools for moving towards wholeness and ""Joy""! I recommend that ALL women who are searching for ""their truth"" read and absorb her well guided empowered message(s) so divinely delivered."
5,The best!,"This book is great! It's helping me see where my problems lie, and how to go about solving them. I find meditating hard, but I see how important it is, and, after reading the chapter on prayer and meditation, I'm going to try to make it a daily practice. You go, Betty, go! I'm really getting a lot out of this book, and I am growing, in the process. I know what Betty means by ""The Joy is in the Journey!"""
5,The Joy is in the journey,"Betty's book is easy to read and more importantly, easy to put into practice everyday. If you are struggling with any issue in your life, big or small, following the suggestons in each chapter is sure to help with your struggle. I find myself rereading various pages when I need a gentle reminder. I recommend this book to all women, no matter their age.Jean Farrell, NY"
2,If'd I known it was Christian based.........,"I am still ""out on a limb"" as to the impact of this book. I may or may not, eventually recant my initial response to ""TRUST THE HIGHER POWER""....""RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD"".... references. I do know, for those that have an ultimate life powered life ""with their Christian God"", that this may be the perfect vehicle for their experience.I had just wished that when I had ordered the book from Amazon that I had known that ""giving over to a Christian Lord"" was paramount to the ""learning"" that would be given in the book. I am not diminishing the lessons offered nor the wisdom offered, nor the depth of important lessons offered.........but was only taken back by the fact if I did not ""believe"" in a ""Christian Lord""...........the book was maybe, irrelevant."
3,"Boy, is my face red...","My review of this album closed with this line:All in all, this is not a collection... but it could have been quite a bit better.That should have read: All in all, this is not a BAD collection...OF COURSE, this is a collection! :)(And to think I faulted the writing in the liner notes. Karmic justice?)"
