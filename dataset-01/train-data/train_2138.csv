2,This one should never have been written.,The Earthsea Trilogy was and is classic- and a trilogy it should have remained. Book four is both unnecessary and completely forgettable.
1,A Trilogy Gone Sour,"This book was a dismaying shock. Having loved the first three books of this TRILOGY and discovering the existence of a fourth, I eagerly read the latest addition. Unfortunately, I found it to be FAR removed from the original set by not only its tone, but it was also written about twenty years after the first three. In fact, the only similarity I detected was that the characters' names and the surroundings were familiar; however,everything had been warped by a set politics and religious opinions that are foreign to the land of Earthsea. This book was as disappointing and repulsive as the the other members of this ill-fated trio were captivating and brilliant. A great trilogy it was, and a trilogy it should have remained. As it is, Tehanu has caused my taste for Ursula LeGuin's works to turn sour."
2,How is this an award winner?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Le Guin's first three books in this series. I thought they were excellent fantasy. This one however, is just bad. There is no other way to describe it. It plods along, it is preachy, it ends terribly, nothing exciting ever happens.Le Guin is a first rate author and I really liked The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. This is one to avoid, however."
1,From fantasy to feminist polemic,"I had read the original Earthsea trilogy as a teenager, and found the world le Guin created and the story she crafted within it to be compelling and utterly original. How disappointing to learn that she spent the time between the trilogy and Tehanu, apparently, watching the Lifetime Channel."
4,An adult book,"I love children's books and I love the earthsea trilogy. To me, Tehanu is not part of the trilogy. It is uses the same characters, but feels more like an adult book than a children's book. (Though that may be partly because I read it as an adult, and the others as a child). It also feels more like a 'women's' book than an adventure - this is to my taste, but not to everyone's. Tales from Earthsea likewise have more of an adult feel. (Some of LeGuin's later work feels more like anthropology than stories, but these are stories)."
1,Why?,"Before reading the fourth book in the Earthsea ""cycle"", I was aware of the opinions of many who had already read this book. Quite frankly, I was hoping that I would disagree with those who were disappointed in ""Tehanu"". But try as I might, I failed to see the beauty in this ""continuation"" of what HAD been one of the greatest trilogies written.Quite simply, ""Tehanu"" lacks the conciseness and mystery of the previous books. While I could - perhaps - forgive Le Guin for her decision to tear apart the world she had so beautifully constructed with this rather mundane and heavy-handed tale, I cannot excuse the absence of poetry here; poetry which abounds in each page of the previous three books.Shame on you, Ursula!"
4,"Good book, but not as good as the others","I have first read the earthsea books when I was about 12, and loved them since. I approched this book with the joy of meeting an old friend, and altugh it is good, it is not as good as the others. I liked the dasker / sadder tone it ad, butr it left too many loose ends. Actualy, it opened more loose ends then it closed.If you haven't read theother earthsea books- go read them now. You won't understand much of this one w/out reading them anyway."
3,"a bit disapointing, but you know you'll buy it anyway...","This is the last book in the Earthsea series, and my least favourite, but if you have read and enjoyed the other three you will still like it."
3,Tehanu,"I found this book thought-provoking but not very enjoyable. It has some intense, unpleasant scenes (physical and sexual abuse of a child) that do not fit in well with the trilogy. I am uncomfortable classifying this as a children's book; I would not mind recommending the trilogy to 10-12 year olds, but Tehanu is not suitable for anyone under 15. It also would not be good for anyone seeking an escapist novel."
2,Was Tehanu written by a ghost writer?,"I loved the Earthsea trilogy (it will always be a trilogy to me) from the first time I read it, in high school. Years later, they are even better. Tehanu is not cut from the same cloth. I was sorely disappointed with the plot line, character development, general tone and themes of the book. While the first three books contained wonderful, compelling and unforgettable tales, this one seemed like a cross between a romance novel and some sort of psycho-mystery. It gave me the same feeling in the pit of my stomach as watching The Phantom Menace and listening to them explain the Force in terms of science. I can only hope that Ursula LeGuin herself actually writes any future books, because I can't believe the same author wrote this as the first three."
2,dragging.. dragging,"I hoped that this book, which won the nebula, would be a great wrap-up to the series. There is definitely a sense of closure at the end of the book, and loose ends are tied up... but the book was flat out too boring for me. As another reviewer said, don't look for a plot. Don't look for any major developments either, until the last, what, 10 pages?? I was dissapointed as well."
1,Eviscerating your own classic work,"Dull, dull, dull. One of the two most disappointing books I've ever read. I read the first three books many years ago and have re-read them many times since then. All three are quite brief, but only because there is not a single unnecessary word in any of them. Unfortunately, Ursula LeGuin has decided to sacrifice every other virtue of her writing in favor of a polemical rant. Is it supposed to be ""empowering"" for women to be a book where nothing of importance happens? And the villain, who scarcely rates mention, seems motivated by little else than a mean streak of misogyny. If you enjoyed the earlier volumes as much as I did, save yourself the disappointment of reading this book."
5,Earthsea is always great,"This book continues right from the end of The Furthest Shore. The story is slower then the other three, yet it is also much deeper. The primary themes again are being: who are we? Especially who are we after loss? For Tenar/Ghoa it is the loss of husband; for Ged the loss of power, ceasing to be a mage. Also it is man's struggle to conquer death.We also learn in this book that in earthsea, man and dragons were once one race. Men are the children of dragons that horded and built fortresses and forgot how to fly. Therru is an adopted child of Tenar and we find out that she is really the daughter of Kalessin the oldest of dragons. Yet we also find out that Kalessin is really Segoy the creator of earthsea.Segoy leaves his daughter with Ged and Tenar saying he will one day be given a child by them.Key Notes on Names:Tenar / Gohn - ArhaGed / Sparrowhawk - Hawk - DunyTherru / TehanuKalessin / Segoy - OldestOrigon / Aihak"
3,LeGuin follows-on from Earthsea,"Ursula LeGuin's ""Earthsea Trilogy"", particularly ""Wizard of Earthsea"" and ""The Farthest Shore"", are comparable to the great Tolkien, standing head and shoulders above other works of fantasy-fiction, where I have searched in vain for something as inspirational as Lord of the Rings.Someone must have persuaded Ms. leGuin to keep going, and add a further tome to the Trilogy, which she does with relish, leading readers once more around the world of Earthsea, this time from the perspective of a woman heroine, complete with the women's feelings which are absent in the two books mentioned.The inspiring presence of the great dragons of Earthsea is curtailed in this work, confined as it is to one brief appearance, and the story unfolds as a tale of a woman's concerns."
2,"Ged, Retired","I'm not sure why this book was written. LeGuin must have had something in mind to extend her Earthsea epic to a tetralogy.There's some nineties, EarthChild brand feminism. LeGuin complains of ""lazy boys"".Gone are the desperate battles and legendary characters of the first three books. Maybe that's what Ged thinks about while he lays on the radiator like a neutered Tom, silently nodding at idiotic new characters. I'll be honest, I didn't finish the book. In my mind, I gave him a Viking funeral."
1,"Bad , Bad , Bad Book ...","Look , the trilogy itself was great , mainly because it was very easy to read , and because the stories were fun , interesting and magical. However , Ursula chose to ruin all the fun I had by writing this last novell. It is NOT a fantasy book for the child in every one of us !!! It's NOT an easy read , it's NOT magical , and it certainly gives you the blues. I got into big depression after reading this book mainly because I was expecting one more brilliant performance of Sparrowhawk , who we all learned to love , I wanted one last performance. But instead I got a novell with a crippeled SparrowHawk that deals with child abuse , rape , aging and getting in terms with your past. This novell ruined the whole trilogy for me. If you enjoyed the trilogy , do yourself a favour and don't ruin it for yourself by reading Tehanu."
3,Did not fit in with the series,"a great series, i really loved the farthest shore, and really wanted to read the fourth book, as soon as i started, i was really dissapointed, i had wanted an explosive ending, one with Ged being the main character, with Tenar and Arren being there traveling with him, but in this book, there is hardly any travel, barely as much action, not as much magic, it was more of a life story, about Tenar's life and stuggles, which is why there is 3 stars, it was just so different compared to the other books"
1,Disappointment.,"It took me three tries to get passed page 27 of ""A Wizard of Earthsea,"" but once I did, I was hooked. Especially by the second book in the series. The third book sucked me in just as easily as the second.Unfortunately, I read the fourth book.Kirkus Reviews called it "".. A grand conclusion to a revered cycle."" Obviously, whoever wrote the review has no idea what plot, climax, consistency, etc mean. This book was a complete disappointment. I have to admit, I was sucked in by it, but only because I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing was concluded, there was no major Climax point, and it was filled with tripe. I was thoroughly disappointed by the time I realized that nothing had happened, yet I only had a few more pages left. I won't get into the details, because I wouldn't want to spoil the little plot there is in case someone does want to read it.Seeing as this was evidently meant to be the final book, I wonder how many fans Mrs. Le Guin lost after they read this book."
3,Disappointing,"After finishing The Farthest Shore and absolutely loving it, I was greatly excited to read Tehanu...and then disappointed. It is thoroughly disjointed from the overall ""feel"" of the first three books, no doubt due in part to the length of time between the years they were written.I found the writing typical (and lacking the passion that I found in the first three novels), the plot tedious, and the underlying themes completely in-your-face obvious. I read entirely through to the end within a few hours, waiting for something to happen...and nothing did, until the end, when the plot diverged into two different ones, and then abruptly stopped. Honestly, there was a lot of unnecessary plot that could have been left out.It is helpful, however, to remember that there was another sequel written taking place shortly after Tehanu, which ties up a lot of loose ends. But as much as I love the Earthsea books, this was almost a pain to read."
2,Is LeGuin tired of writing?,"I can accept the plot inconsistancies with the previous books in the ""trilogy."" I can accept her vague style of writing. I like her ideas and think they have potential. But I would have thought that, with the passage of time, her writing would improve. Unfortunately, not only does it not improve, it actually seems to have deteriorated. She spends the first 90% or more of the book developing the background, then rushes through the plot development and the climax (if it can be called such) in just a few pages, as if she were sick of the story and of writing in general and just wanted to get it done with. What a shame."
4,Finally!,"We have 3 children ages 7,5 and 2 1/2. Our 2 1/2 year old was just diagnosed with autism and we were having a hard time explaining it to our other children, mainly our 5 year old. I had been a kindergarten teacher for 15 years and had children with special needs in my class almost every year, but when it comes to every day family, it was more difficult to explain. Many books are over his head and just too wordy. This book finally helped talk about how our son is different, but still a wonderful, loving child that we can enjoy just like every other person in the world. Well worth the money."
4,Military Innovation in the Interwar Period,"This book is a necessary for those who want to understand the relationship between development of technology and military innovation. It is not an easy book to read, but contains tremendous amount of information along with accurate historical records. Must for military tacticians and historians alike."
2,Not much bopping,I bought this for my 10 yr old son for Christmas. He was not very impressed and neither was I. The songs he did know were okay. He didn't even want to hear the whole cd. We got to track 9 and stopped.
2,"Look at the playlist and download the ""clean"" song versions on itunes","I bought this for my 6 year old son (who loves the commercials) for Christmas. I wish I would've heeded the advice of other reviewers. The music is terrible. Most of the lead singers aren't awful, but it's the chorus of out of tune teeny-bopper girls singing through every song that ruins even the tolerable songs. Honestly, download the clean versions of the songs on the playlist from itunes; you and your child will be much happier."
4,Daughter likes it.,"Its just a bunch of kids singing pop songs. My daughter likes it. Personally, you should take written reviews for music with a grain of salt. Its all based on opinion."
1,Blasphemy,"All Kidz Bop albums are complete abominations. Rerecording these popular songs is just sad. I can't understand why anyone would buy this CD for their children. If they like these modern songs, then just buy them the real thing. I guarantee that the real professional musicians who sing them do a better job than the little brats on this CD. The song selection on these albums is frankly shocking. I wouldn't allow my children to listen to such current songs as by artists like Gwen Stefani, Nelly Furtado, Kelly Clarkson, and Fergie. Merely having kids sing these terrible songs in no way makes them better or appropriate for young audiences."
3,farmer's bench,"Very good quality and nice finish. The legs are a little thin at the bottom, so my grandchildren seeem to tip it."
3,Its Ok,What you see is what you get. It's a bench. Someone was sitting on it and left a blue mark on the surface which I haven't been able to remove. It's nothing special really but it matched the dining table I put it with.
1,Not very happy - cheap finish,"I received this watch as a gift. After part-time wear for just a few months, I noticed that almost all of the shiney silver tone has worn away to a matt finish. Now there are patches of shiney and matt finishes all over so it looks very cheap. The warranty seems pretty vague about covering the band portion of the watch, PLUS you have to pay to ship the watch to and from the repair center and then no guarantees that they can correct the problem. I've purchased a few Seikos in the past, which I know are more expensive, however... I've NEVER had a problem with a Seiko's finish wearing off. Ever. I'd rather pay $250 for a Seiko that lasts for 15+ years than $75 on a watch that only lasts a few months.If I ever receive an AK watch again, I'll be sure to return it asap!"
3,moisture damaged it,"I bought this for my wife and it hasn't broke, but the band has spotted/rusted after she wore it when washing dishes just a few times."
2,Not a good watch......,I love the look of this watch but just after a few months the finish goes away right down to the copper underfinish. Also not a good seal and if I get my hands wet which is freaquently since I work in the medical field it gets water in it and then I have to put it in a bowl of rice for 12 hours. Plus I dropped it on my carpet the other day and the glass got a crack in it. It is so cute but not durable at all. I will fork out a little more money upon my next purchase to ensure a better product.
2,In need of a re-edit,"While full of well-researched quality information, this book is a frustrating read, largely due to the lack of copy-editing. It is a rarity in this book to find a page without an error. I have spent more time trying to decipher what the authors intended to say than I have appreciating the information they provide."
3,Pretty but uncomfortable,"These are nice looking shoes, but I really am a flats wearer, and couldn't bear to wear them for more than a few minutes. I couldn't find anyone who wanted to take them from me, either."
3,Narrow & longish,"The shoes are beautiful, but run narrow and longish, also seams inside kind of scratchy, so I can't say that they are comfortable."
3,Sure everybody loves them.....,"This book does have alot of great recipes in it, but that is because they are old standbys, at least at my house. I do enjoy the fact that it has the nutritional information listed, which I wish more recipe books would follow suit. And the little tips at the bottom of each page are interesting. Most all of the recipes are fairly simple and this would be a great starter book."
5,Excellent Read,"This story is heartbreaking but worth every penny. We don't realize the true cost of our electricity. It's an excellent story about activism and resistance, and I recommend this to anyone interested in learning about ecological justice issues."
1,Linda Hogan should stick to short poetry!,"""Absolutely terrible."" raves me. This book is only a good read for Native American Women or bleeding heart librals. My school forced me to read this book and I find it distasteful. Steriotypical remarks were made about white men and I find that rude and offensive. Not much probably said about that but I garauntee that if this were a Story about stuborn Indians who wouldn't let a town benifit from a hydroelectric dam there would be much controversey. However I must say the writting was excelent."
5,The Killing Club,"I bought this for myself and my husband. Marcie Walsh is on my Soap, and I wanted to be able to go along with the book and the Soap. My husband is the reader, so he read it, I didn't. He said it was very good."
2,BORING!,"I watch ""One Life To Live"" each day and bought this book just like any fan of the show. What a waste of time and money I spent on this. Where was the action? Where was the suspense? I thought there were too many characters to keep up with, and the ones they had did not interest me in the slightest. A few mysteries were solved, including discovering who the actual villain was. But, it's not worth wasting your time and money over. If you've watched OLTL and have seen how people in the Love Center group have been killed, or have seen how someone attempted to kill others, then you know the entire book. Don't bother."
2,stick to what you do best,I was a fan of OLTL years ago but haven't been able to watch for a few years. I must say that sometimes it's better when people stick to what they do best! This book met my expectations as it was not very good. I felt the writing was juvenile and a bit far-fetched to be believable. I did read the whole book which I guess says something. I wouldn't recommend it but I did get through the whole thing.
1,Poorly Written & Boring,"The only reason I finished this book was to discover who the killer was, but I skipped through most of it. The plot moves too slowly; after the first killing, the second one takes too long to occur. The characters are not all that likable and not very interesting so you really don't care if they are killed or not. The crime scenes are not very descriptive and it is evident that the author knows nothing about being a detective. As others have mentioned, the writing style is something that a middle school student could have written. The ending is boring, too."
2,Could have been better,"The synopsis of the book made it sound fairly descent, but I was wrong. The first murder took up 50% of the book leaving me to wonder when were these other ""murders"" going to happen. The main character Jamie seemed flat and boring. She was engaged to her boss and yet seemed to not really care for him or even show him any respect. (If you read the book you'll know what I mean). The last ""murders"" did not happen until the last 35 pgs of the book. By then I sorta figured who the murderer was and not really surprised. I do not reccommend spending more than what I spent on this book (1.50) because that's all it's worth. If you want a good murder mystery read a James Patterson book."
3,A good story but awful writing,"As a long time fan of ""One Life to Live"" I was very curious about this book so I bought it a few weeks back to give it a try before they incorporated the killings into the plot line of the soap.I must say that this was by far, one of the worst written books ever. The writing and grammar were terrible, I felt like I was reading something written by a junior high English student.However, the story itself had some entertainment value. The killer definetly kept me guessing which is a rare thing for me. I was surprised by the outcome but not shocked. The ending was weak and could have been written so much better but it wasn't awful.I am curious to see how this plays out on the soap as there is currently no character that fits the description of the actual killer, I just hope that they play it out better than they did in the book."
2,Boring,"This is a pretty standard mystery without much to surprise a reader of these things. The protagonist is a tough lady detective. The murders are imaginative. The flashbacks are standard fare.Really without the soap opera tie-in, there's nothing to distinguish this book from a thousand other mysteries coming out the same year. Buy only if you love these cliches (and some do) but even then be prepared for boredom."
1,didn't care for it,"I am a long time fan of One LIfe to Live and that's the main reason I bought The Killing Club. I couldn't get through half of the book. There are too many characters, the writing didn't hold my interest and I was overall bored.Even the Killing Club plot on One Life to Live is boring."
5,Very Sunpensful yet very good,I am a big fan of the Soap One Life to Live and when I heard about the book being avaible to everyone I went to the bookstore and bought it. The book is very interesting. Yet it also keeps you in suspense as to who is behind it all. This is a great murder mystery and I would highly reccomend it to anyone of my friends.
5,Just what I'm looking for.,"This book was better than I could've ever imagined. I myself do not like reading books because very few authors can pull off a good book. At first, I was THINKING I was going to be disappointed, because the author was a writer of a soap that doesn't always do its best, and it just seemed weird. However, I took a huge step and read it. There is humor, tons of mystery and suspense, a few affairs, common controversy, guaranteed shocks in every chapter, and a question you will ask yourself, who is killing the Killing Club and how close are they to the main character? This book is an easy read and will be liked by most, if not all."
3,Entertaining froth!,"I read this novel and enjoyed it sort of as you would enjoy a chocolate sundae.The plot rolls along and you keep turning the pages as the characters keep getting killed off one by one. The police detective Jamie Ferrara is likeable. The author keeps setting up likely villains but they keep getting killed. The real villain is one you would least suspect. As someone else wrote, the motivation for the suite of murders is not particularly persuasive."
5,Equipto will be a San Francisco Rap Legend,Equipto's Vintage Volume Won: the front album cover has a photograph of Equipto on a microphone; the back cover has two more pics of Equipto in a Studio. This version was released in limited numbers and is impossible to find. 9 tracks. Value $150 to 250Equipto Vintage Vol. Won (Avant Garde) is the rerelease version. This album is also very rare and hard to find. This version has a drawing of Equipto on the cover; the back cover has a photograph of Equipto holding a microphone and pointing with one finger towards the sky. This version has 11 tracks. Value $50-$150Both Albums Versions are from Solidarity Records. Either Version is a Great Find and Must Have. Equipto is one the best rappers of All Time.
4,Great item,"My midwife told me about it and I really think it made the difference. Ni had a hoppy but this blow up one is better because you can make it very firm, which keeps the baby up further so you don't have to hunch over."
3,Great idea,"I was excited to try this out, so I ordered 2 of them.Item arrived quickly. However, it should be noted that the small charger says that it is for 1 use only. So, I am going to wait until it is absolutely necessary before trying it out. I thought that it could be used more than once (then charge it up), so next time I will read the documentation more carefully.[For some reason, the Amazon order search can't find order #104-7577799-6062631, so I can't leave seller feedback.]"
1,"Save your money, don't buy",I bought two of these last year and put one in my car and another in my wife's car for emergency purposes. Both did not work. One might be unlucky but two shows that the product is of poor quality.
4,Important polemic,"Upsetting, disturbing documentary about the nuclear power industry, and itsself-professed safety versus the facts.The film is dated now, both in technique and some issues, and it never eventries to be even handed. There are places where the lines between fact, theoryand personal point of view get unfortunately muddy. This is a film definitelymore for preaching to (and whipping up) the choir, than making converts.Yet, some of the uncovered facts are indeed shocking (e.g. a huge, dangerousconstruction and design flaw in a nuclear plant discovered only after years ofinsisting it was not only safe, but `one of the most carefully examined structures ever built.' )The film may be less than perfect , but that doesn't mean it doesn't still pack a punch."
4,Harrowing warning,I first saw this film in 1984 and never forgot the impact it made. I was pleased to see recently that I could buy a DVD. The information is not outdated and the message - nuclear power and the waste it engenders is incredibly dangerous with the potential to wipe out most if not all life unless much more carefully managed than it was in the 1980's (and is today) - seems even more relevant after Chernobyl and Fukushima. Buy a copy and watch with your friends. Then think about Indian Point or it's equivalent near you.
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MEDIA READER,"If you purchase this from CompUSA you will be shipped a USB2Connect, Adaptec part number 2126900. It took 4 weeks, 3 phone calls and 3 emails to customer service to get an RMA and return postage label issued. Then a trip to FedEx to ship it back. Major Hassle. I'm still waiting to see if my credit card will actually be debited when the return is processed. I told them about the problem with the listing a month ago, but it doesn't seem to be fixed yet."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this anime, it was only 60 minutes long and even though I knew that and expected there to be some sacrafice of story, I felt like there was virtually no story at all. Be prepared for lots of cheesy anime cliches, pointless dialouge, and to be confused by mostly everything. I won't say that it was a total waste of time to watch it, the art was decent, the voice acting was okay, and the characters had the potential to be really cool... but they weren't. If there was more development of the characters, and more explanation of what was going on and why, this could have been better. I would suggest renting this if possible and not spending the money on it when you could get something else for your money."
2,"not terrible, but not terribly good either","Sorcerer On The Rocks is a semi-decent little OAV. The...uh, for lack of a better term, hero, Shibas Scotch is faintly reminiscent of Dark Schneider from the Bastard!! anime series, but lacks most of Dark Schneider's redeeming qualities. I gave it two stars because the characters are interesting if not particularly likeable and the animation is superb, but the plot is mostly T&A and excuses for T&A...the only unalloyed praise I can give it is that watching it caused me to go out and buy The Sorcerer Hunters (which is ten thousand times better) just to find out what the heck was going on. Not an awful show, but really not worth the time and money investment."
3,Okay.,"It's good enough to watch once, but I can't picture watching it more than a couple of times. There were a couple of times I thought ""hey this part is funny"" but for the most part it wasn't very amusing. If they ever do have any more I probably would rent them."
1,Be advised that this is just a book - not a deck,"In spite of the three reviews online (which appear to be about the deck), there are no cards included in this product. This is simply a companion book for the deck itself."
2,Don't expect more than Pretty,"Beautiful artwork, but the cards are very cold and sterile. I'm a sci-fi fan who appreciates the creation of alien worlds and inventive traditions, but for tarot cards to have depth, they require archtypes and symbolism that the reader can relate to their own life rather than newly created worlds the reader is not familiar with. Buy these for the gorgeous pictures, but if you're looking for cards you can make a connection to, this is not a place I'd recommend to start."
5,Cats Cats Cats,"I am an avid collector of tarot decks, I have over 30 decks but this one is the only one I use for readings the rest are for my collection"
2,Not very helpful,"The cards are nice to look at, but not clear at all. The book isn't very helpful, either. It seems watered down so only the good aspects come through. Unless you know the card meanings by heart, you might not pick up on some important things. Cats are known for being mysterious, and these cats are no exception!"
2,Mostly A Waste,Although the images are well done I was disappointed the concepts were about the people & not the cats. I guess I should have known by the title of the deck. Also they seem to follow traditional tarot presentations without anything new or fresh to offer. The Outer Regions simply doesn't quite catch my interest.
3,Beautiful Illustrations,"The storyline and illustrations are beautiful! However, the vague interpretations for the tarot layouts were quite frustrating when the multiple one-word descriptions contradicted each other."
1,not a Mini-bust!!!,warning this is labeled incorrectly!!! if you purchase this you will receive a micro-bust instead. if you can find the actual mini-bust the size will be around 6.5 inches this one however is around 3.5 inches.
3,Harmonium,This is a great piece of music written for huge forces. It is very difficult to record full orchestras playing complex scores with massed choirs. Unfortunately this recording lack clarity and subtlety. The result is a grand indistinct mush in the Wild Nights where the choirs' diction and phrasing tends to get lost.A brilliant piece but we need a clearer version to get the full benefit. The BBC did a great job at the first night of the proms but it hasn't been released.
1,Useless unless all you need is return labels,I bought these as part of a package Amazon was offering with the Dymo Turbo 400 printer. Totally useless unless you need a lot of return labels. You are better off buying mailing labels. That way you can print both your address and the person you are sending it to on the same label.
4,Truth Sayer,"This book taught: How Sojourner Truth got her name, Truth had a great sense of humor for someone who suffered so much, that literacy is not the only way to learn, and more."
2,Definitely made simple,"The ""Made Simple"" series isn't bad at all; the chemistry book is great and really helped me get into chemistry. However the Physics Made Simple is just way too simple. Much of introductory physics is common sense and far too many pages are given to simple concepts making the book an extremely cursory treatment of physics.On the positive side, the experiments are interesting and useful."
2,Simple for whom? Not for beginners at all.,"I bought this book because I'm enrolled in Intro Physics as a prerequisite for a graduate program. I'll admit, I've been out of school for several years, but this book is definitely NOT easy. It (as many, many so-called ""easy"" books do) assumes that the reader already knows the basics of physics, algebra, and geometry/trigonometry. I know practically nothing about any of the previous subjects, so I needed a REAL basic presentation of physics....this book was not it."
3,"If you want some of the tracks it's okay, but not great","This album actually is music from both ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset,"" both of which are incredible movies. Much of the music is very enjoyable, however the album really doesn't flow well with the baroque pieces from the first movie interspersed with the other songs. Apparently these aren't even the same versions of the baroque pieces. I enjoyed Julie Delpy's songs because of their relationship to the movie (though I liked the acoustic ""A Waltz for a Night"" version from the movie better than this studio version). The last two grunge angst songs I don't recognize at all from either movie, why are they here? And unfortunately the Nina Simone song, ""Just In Time,"" that ended ""Before Sunset"" isn't on here. If you really want it, it can be found on her album ""At the Village Gate"" or ""Tomato Collection.""So, taken as individual tracks there are good songs on this soundtrack, but the album as a whole isn't spectacular."
4,"Nice songs, unfortunately ordered","I'll agree with many of the other reviewers: It's great to finally have access to many of these songs. But indeed, not including something by Nina Simone is a real error. Also, the order of the tracks on this disc diminishes the songs' effect. I expect a soundtrack CD to replicate the mood of the film, but this CD ends with the up-tempo, Euro-pop songs from ""Before Sunrise,"" letting the listening experience end on a harsh note. To solve the problem I re-ordered the songs on my ipod, and added in the Ivy song from the trailer as well as a Nina Simone song. Problem solved! So yes, this is a good CD but not a great one. It requires some listener input to become great."
4,"Uneven, but very good nonetheless","First off, Amazon is wrong. Nina Simone is not on this puppy (unfortunately, as it is key to the second film; you'll need to see it understand). All the music is interesting, though going back and forth with classical and pop is a bit unnerving at times. Julie Delpy's songs, however, are really very good. If you like the films, as I do, and enjoy how the music functions in them, I would recommend this CD; if not, I don't suppose you would get anything out of this, but then that's too bad for you."
5,A splendid book,This is one of the best books on Roman Catholics in Modern North America that I have encountered.
1,"Like most ""intellectuals"", McGreevy is clueless","It's perfectly fine for John McGreevy to sit in his ivory tower and pass judgment on those he deems ""racist.""What he needs is a reality check....he should take a ride through ANY big city and see how once vital working class neighborhoods have been turned to dangerous slums by his precious ""integration.""He needs to be shown the ever-growing lists of all the Catholic churches and schools that have been closed and parishes either merged or phased out of existence...many over 100 years old... because the denizens of these ""changed"" neighborhoods either can't or won't support them.Like most of the so-called ""intelligenstia"", McGreevy fails to see that what is marvelous in theory just does not work in reality."
4,A Screw Is Not a Screw Maybe for You?,"If you plan on taking this unit apart to move down the road, I suggest buying your own hardware, like nuts and bolts to assemble it. The frame is well made and built similar to a tank. But the fasteners, screws a bolts are cheap from China. They strip easily when I assembled this unit even with the correct drill bit for my drill."
3,get what you pay for,"i purchased four of these products, one was flawless.the other three were unstable, the legs were not even, (off balance), and the hardware that holds the rack together is cheap."
3,"Underwhelmed, but acceptable","I believe the product will work for our needs. It was a little difficult to assemble because there were some issues with holes lining up and the quality of the hardware was not premium. The product was white, but came with rust looking stains on several of the pieces, putting a little damper on the overall look of the product. Because we are storing our water bottles in the back closet, it's not critical that it look perfect, but it's a little disappointing for find rust on a product purchased new. It does appear sturdy enough to do the job, so while I'm not blown away by the product, it's certainly tolerable."
4,I like it.,"I looked all over the place until I found this 3 teir water bottle rack. I wanted the chrome one but it was a lot more expensive so I settled with the white. I get 3 bottles a month so this is perfect for my needs. The quality is nice, but I was not happy with the quality of the hardware it came with. One of the heads of the nuts included broke while tightening. Luckily it was tight enough that I didn't have to worry about it. Your bottles will leak so I would suggest putting some type of tray or something underneath it to cath the drips of water. Usually this only happens for a day or two and then once the bottles I think settle in this position they seem to stop leaking. Strange but hey, I'm not complaining. All in all I dig this rack."
2,Not much to choose from,"The box was heavily damaged on arrival. Probably the fault of the ""circumstances beyond control"" that were mentioned in the delay of delivery email I received. The product itself was more difficult to assemble that it should. The tiers are all the same, yet the legs are slightly tapered. That is a design flaw which forces you to bend the legs for assembly. I feel the need to clarify that this is not the fault of Amazon, and there is not much competition for such items. After all is said and done, it feels flimsy, weak trembles when you load it, but it will hold the weight of three 5 gal jugs and keeps them out of the way."
4,Compact and convenient,"Finally I can keep the water bottles in the kitchen for easy access, but not have them taken up my floor space."
4,Water Bottle Caddy,"It was time consuming to find a product that fit my needs that was not overly expensive. I needed two of them as I have six bottles. The product was NOT overly hard to assemble but it is tricky. You need to STRICTLY go top to bottom on the crossbars or they will not fit. Overall, the item is serving the purpose as intended and is very pleasant on the eyes. Well worth the value."
3,Water bottle rack,"It is as described, a water bottle rack. Better than the bottles just being stacked on the floor, but really can't decide rather it's too industrial looking for the kitchen or not. It's just a matter of personal preference I guess."
4,Great... if,"The product is great, looks good, sturdy... if you get the right parts. I ordered two, one was good no problems, the second had three front legs and one back and therefore could not be assembled. I had to send it back and that process was easy, free with a label printed off the computer, but I haven't received the replacement as of yet."
2,Rusty Pipes,I ordered one of these a few months ago and really liked it so I ordered two more. I just got them and the pipes have rust all over them. This was very disappointing.
3,Works but misaligned,"The product works well enough -- it holds three five gallon bottles, but while in the process of assembling it many of the pieces did not align properly causing the rack to wobble when unloaded."
3,good but....,this was an interesting read. If you like a good storyline and well developed charecters then you'll like this one. but you MUST start at the begining of the series or you'll be beyond confused. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with the charecters thinking- they are suppossed to be these super smart people but for the rest of us it should have been spelled out a little more.
5,Lush,The story line was poetic and the scenery was very lush. The acting was great and the charactors were well developed from book to screen. The actors were all sexy and were great in their prospective roles.
1,Beware the DVD compatibility,"The movie arrived, and when I realized I couldn't play it on my DVD (I was also surprised that it had been shipped from abroad) I went back on Amazon and saw the warning at the bottom of the DVD info. I suppose that warning was there when I purchased it, probably in my enthusiasm overlooking it, but I still felt annoyed that Amazon was supporting an overseas DVD seller as a prime member shipment when their goods obviously play on very few US systems. It felt devious to me and I am not happy about it. Buyer beware of the DVD shipments! Read more carefully than I did!"
1,What a disappointment,One of the great pleasures of seeing this film in the theatre was the lush green of the English countryside. This print (or pressing) looks like it was abandoned on a deck chair in the south of France ... dry and faded.
3,I only watch this for one thing,"Woman in Love is a good movie for some, I only like the part with Alan Bates walking naked in the woods. I will watch the love seance with Alan Bates over and over. I rented it from Gulfgate libary many times."
2,Women In Love With Bozos,"I haven't read the book, but I have read ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"",and this film seems to follow D H Lawrence's theme: Women are immature, emotional, unreasonable, manipulative creatures. Men are weak, misguided, and ever so vulnerable to a woman's whims. Men's downfall is women.This film contains much skinny-dipping, interpretive dancing, nude male wrestling, and animal cruelty. The ending was a joke. Two stars for the beautiful scenery and cinematography. The actors did their best with what they had to work with.While watching this video, I was reminded of a saying by Cher: ""Some women get all excited about nothing - and then marry him."""
2,DH Lawrence is weird,"For those of you not familiar with DH Lawrence, he must be really strange. I thought the move was weird, though it probably means it very accurately portrayed the book. I don't know, as I never read the book. I did not care much for the movie, since it is strange and in places very depressing. For example, a young couple who are in love drown for no apparent reason. As far as I was concerned, the highlight of the movie was Glenda Jackson taking off her shirt and showing her breasts."
1,Another Botched Technical Transfer!,"As with ""A Touch of Class"", I couldn't enjoy the undeniable artistic merit of this film because of the lousy technical transfer to DVD. Once again, the DVD box blurb states a 4:3 screen ratio, but what you actually see is a 16:9 image made to fit into the 4:3 frame. In this transfer we see less of the ""black bars"" at the top and bottom of the screen as the 16:9 image has been cropped to fill up more of the 4:3 space. So, while we see an almost full 4:3 picture, in reality we have actually lost peripheral screen detail in the process. Additionally, my copy has an annoying purply-blue vertical line at the leftmost edge of the frame which is most distracting to screen content. For me, this is another great film ruined by those (who should know better?) taking dodgy technical short-cuts!"
4,Insightful Book,Enjoyed reading this informative book. It gives good insight into the topic of whistle blowers.
1,FELL APART FIRST DAY!,"I purchased this item for my daughter and she took it out to the pool and it stopped working after 30 mins and the bulb cover wouldn't stop falling off. Not a good product, very cheaply made."
2,duke nut sheller,pivot bolt worked loose after shelling three or four pecans i replaced boltwith a longer bolt and lock. works fine now.did not expect to have to rebuilda new tool. MADE IN CHINA. HAD I KNOWN I WOULD NOT BOUGHT IT...
3,Duke Sheller is ok but not great.,I have another brand name sheller simular to this. The other is better. The teeth on this sheller don't meet together as well as the other one. Requires more work to 'nip' the shell.
1,Duke Company Hand Pliers Nut Sheller 125 Nut Cracker,"It works fairly well,but then again the blades didn't last all that long. Then bent as time went on and not that much time either, about two weeks or so...."
4,"Looks good, Works better when sharpened.","Once I realized it needed to be sharpened (as delivered) and did so, it really is pretty good. Nice wide opening for large nuts and the coated handles are comfortable. Wirthe the price."
2,didn't work,"In order for it to work, the two sides need to be aligned. The screw holding the two sides would not stay tightened in order to align the two sides. I returned it."
5,I understand all the fuss over Joan Baez!,"I knew very little of Joan's voice and talent. My husband selected and purchased this album. What a wonderful discovery I've made. The more I play this album, the more I enjoy it. Joan has her best known songs on this album but it is the heart she puts into all of the songs that show her voice to it's best advantage. Relax, and listen to this exceptional album."
4,Loved hearing her voice again after all these years,"This is a pretty darn good CD, especially if you like Joan Baez. Most young people today have never heard of her, let alone heard her sing. Some of my children have listened politely to me playing some of her songs, but I know they don't really enjoy it. I suppose it's because they don't have the feel of the 60's and what the music was so much about, ideas, etc.Anyway, this CD is pretty good, and I really liked hearing several songs I never heard her play back when I was young. A couple of them are very humorous. The only downside to the CD was a couple of my favorite songs, this particular rendition wasn't exactly what was on some of my old LP records. Sometimes this was less pleasing, and sometimes, it was not. Bottom line is out of the 22 songs, I found 14 that are now on my iPod, so I can listen to them wherever I go."
4,"Good stuff, poor sound quality","I have been a Joan Baez fan since I was a child. Her early works are especially appealing because her young voice was so perfectly sweet, high and clear.HOWEVER, that said, this is not a great recording. The cuts are pretty much unedited. There is a lot of ambient noise, and maybe some people feel that adds a cool ambiance, but for me it is really distracting and annoying. A live performance doesn't have to sound bad. Also, there is no equalizing going on - sometimes the guitar playing just sounds like loud, hard, repetitive (and boring) strumming.Anyway, it brought back a lot of good memories and made me appreciate the advances in recording technology that have come along since the 60s."
5,ERRORS IN LISTING,Please note that the Amazon description and the reader reviews refer to DIFFERENT books than that shown in the listing
4,Using the Opteka Telephoto lens,The lens performs well for the price but the physical diameter interfers with thebuilt in flash which casts a shadow on the finished picture.
5,Really enjoyable,"Like the other reviewer, I don't know why this wasn't/isn't more popular. It is entertaining and the characters are drawn quite well. The first half was very funny and the second half more poignant. I have watched it many times, it is one of maybe 5 movies I actually own. If you need a laugh without crass, check it out."
5,Signing time DVD's,"I have been purchasing Signing Time DVDs for my twin grandsons since they were a year old. They are now 2 1/2 yrs old and still enjoy watching and learning sign language. I would highly recommend these DVD's. When they start school they will have a 'second' language and if one of their classmates is hearing impaired, they will be able to communicate with them."
5,Excellent Learning Tool that is Fun Too!,"We started using all the Signing Times DVDs when my twins when they were 9 months old, now they are three and they still love to watch them. They love to sign and watch Rachel, Alex, and Leah; they ask to watch it several times during the week. The content is appropriate, the signs used are relevant to the majority of situations for early life. Rachel, the teacher, has the right amount of exitement without knocking you over. The songs are catchy and fun and Alex and Leah are great actors!"
3,BORING,"WHILE THE MOVIE IS WHAT IS PROMISED , IT'S BECOMES BORING AFTER THE THIRD OR FOURTH SCENE. EACH SEGMENT IS THE SAME AIMLESS ACTING. JUST SOME GIRL TAKING OFF HER CLOTHES. FROM THE TITLE, YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE NUDITY THAN THERE IS (FRONTAL NUDITY WAS SOMEWHAT RARE.) THE GIRLS ARE GOOD LOOKING BUT NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL. WORTH A RENTAL NOT A PURCHASE. IT'S ALREADY ON MY BACK SHELF."
2,Journalistic Tripe,"Let's call a spade a spade: Zinsmeister has never carried a rifle in his life, and his account reflects this fact. Enough said."
4,Gripping Tale of Soldier Stories,"If your looking for a high-level review of the strategy or tactics of the Iraq War -- look elsewhere. This is not the ""General's War"" (an excellent book on the 1st Gulf War but told exclusively from the highest levels). If you're interested in a gripping tale of how individual soldiers fought the war and their day-to-day experiences (at least for the 1st month of the war)... this is definitely your book. Excellent reporting by Zinsmeister. I literally finished the book cover-to-cover in a single day. You'll clearly get an appreciation for the sacrifice, hardships, and professionalism of the soldiers who are defending our freedoms!"
1,Hated It!!,"When I first picked up this book I was beyond excited to read it. However, from almost the first page I was disappointed. Mr. Zinsmeister did an aweful job writing this book. Instead of focusing almost exclusively on the soldiers he decided to spend most of the book either discussing himself or his political views. I might have been willing to overlook his obvious conservative bias if he had bothered to accurately portray the otherside when he decided to debate how his view was correct. This whole book wasn't worth the paper it was written on."
2,"God, Country & Apple Pie","I am very reluctant to write this review for two reasons: I have not served in this theater of operations, and I have very little to contribute that has not already been written by the other reviewers. This having been said, I would remind the readers that as well-intended as the author may have been during his one-month visit to the battlefield, it was just that--a visit and nothing more. Granted, he placed himself in harm's way, however, the book royalties will serve no doubt as some compensation. What really sticks in my craw is being told what an honor it is to die for your country, especially by a civilian on a thirty-day journalistic tour. There is just too much ""god, country & apple pie"" being served up!"
2,Honest but mediocre,"Although it is not clear what is the target audience of this book, it is certainly not the readers with a good background of knowledge on military matters, who want to learn more from a reporter with a real battle experience. The author has some interesting views on war generally and on the character of the US soldiers in particular, but he fails to give a pwerful image of this very importand campaign. It is true that action begins after thw first 70 pages and that the author talks a lot about himself and his personal experiences and inconviniences but these are not the main failures. The really disappointing feature is the absence of these small but interesting and little known details that thrill the readers who have not been witnesses themselves to the horrors and the adrenaline of a real battle."
4,Lori Jo Hendrix makes it a 4 star film,"PRISON HEAT is one more ""women behind bars"" flick but this onehas Lori Jo Hendrix (34d-24-36) as one of the young women. Sheand 3 other Coeds are on vacation in Greece and cross over intoTurkey,where they are set up and locked up. The four are allforced to be strip searched by the prison Boss who likes whathe sees in Lori when he removes her tight T-shirt and shortshorts. Lori and friends must fight lesbians, sex starved guardsand endure that shower scene we all know must be included inthis jailhouse drama. The Prison Boss orders Lori to his officeand alone she enters and guess what he has in mind after shesits down and refuses his offer to have a drink from his bottle.Yes...if Ms.Hendrix makes another film I hope it's also onewhere she is another Damsel in Distress."
4,Damn is big....,"It look massive on my desk... is strong, and you can do a lot of thing without a tool.Pro: Big, can fit any WCS, look nice, The 25cm side fan help a lot my chipset temp..Cons: Damn heavy, not recomended if you are lan party people, The 25cm fan is to big and does'nt let see the interior of the case."
4,Good graduated lessons,"This book offers a series of lessons each building on previous skills and adding new ones. After much searching, these are the only books I have found that do this. I use them extensively in teaching the Microsoft applications. There are the explanatory pages and the very valuable procedure pages. Illustrations are also very relevant.Caveat: They are not perfect (what is?), and I always do the lessons myself before I give them to a student. However, they get to keep the lessons for reference."
5,DDC Learning Series are Great,These DDC learning workbooks are the best. Rather than just read about how to do something with these books you actually learn by doing. Really fantastic if that is your best way of learning.
3,the mp3s had drms!!!,I saw it on sale and bought it but I didn't know it had drms on it. A couple months later the mp3s expired and puff they are gone!! Great version of the 9th though. Maybe because I bought it on sale it was only for a short duration. I don't have any problems with any other mp3s from amazon.
2,Just about avarage and not that shiny...,"True - all those ""market-place reviewers"" fail to mention the fact that this recording sounds quite veiled, ""dark"" and ""dead""; too dense, no real sound-spread, no breath.The hall maybe good for live performances but when coming to record there it is not that great (other live recording there prove the same).In addition, one should call this Haitink interpretation ""a Beethoven symphony for tympani and orchestra"", and mind you, even the timpani are not captured that great...In a word: this is a small disappointment - no matter what others think of it."
3,just average,"In a field so full of important versions, any new Ninth requires some justification. Even by the Amazon customer reviews standards, so often exemplifying a certain hyperbole, the reception reserved to this recording has been puzzling. This is a well played Ninth, lacking in new interpretative insights: average, overall, in a difficult and demanding field.Not to mention some obvious, ""classic"" interpretations, including the impulsive Furtwaengler or Karajan's more ""objective"", superb 1962 recording, anyone interested in recent recordings would be well advised to look elsewhere. Rattle's Vienna Philharmonic recording is an interesting mix of new approaches and Wiener sensibilities. For an alternative reading, based on recent scholarship but taking a modern-instruments approach, Zinman's Tonhalle CD is particularly worthwhile. Lean but thoughtful, well-played and with clear interpretative objectives."
5,Spiritual practice in everyday life,"As a psychotherapist and student of Zen, I found this book clear and informative.So often we read esoteric spiritual teachings that don't speak to our daily struggles.This book does and you don't have to be into Zen to use what it offers.Anyone can take something from it.The insights Zen koans have to offer,which can be confusing to understand are articulated clearly and plainly. Birx takes what could be very complex ideas and lays them out for us to use with whatever we are dealing with in our life.Zen practice is a profound method for waking up to our life, and Ellen Birx shows us the way with insight. I recommend this book to health professionals and spiritual seekers alike."
5,One of the Best of NFAK,A CD which is a must in your NFAK collection or it could be somthing to start with ! If you understand Punjabi/(Urdu) You would listen to it daily !Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan NEVER Disappoints !
4,"very enjoyable, always thought-provoking","very enjoyable book, it always pays to spend time thinking wether you agree or not with the author. gets sometimes too lost in details or irrelevant higer moments (the chances that you will get killed way before the 6th moment explodes in your face far outweigh the rationale why you should even waste time worrying about it ). I would have loved to hear Nassim's war stories about VAR, and the very opiniated feelings he has (as do a lot of people) against this highly trivialized risk-reporting tool. we need more books like that to drill into the heads of our risk managers points that we spend our life explaining again and again."
5,Without a doubt the best book on financial markets ever,"Without a doubt the best book on financial markets ever. Very insightfull, the only clear exposition of what really maters to real traders in the real world."
2,Quite frustrating,"I liked Taleb's book, but I also found it quite frustrating to read. Whenever I looked closely at a definition or an equation, it was more likely to be incorrect than not. Further, I'm afraid I also found the prose at times overbearing: statements to the effect that 'People with PhD degrees are of a higher mental calibre than those without', and similars, are really out of place. I think the book should have been more rigourously edited by the publisher. Authored by a practitioner with interest in mathematical analysis, it could have been an extremely useful book."
1,Get an Editor,"This book could very well be the most insightful thing ever on risk management. I would not know, I quit reading it after the first few pages.The problem being the author constantly inserts these 'option wizards' and charts anywhere he so desires. It is absurd, they are placed in the middle of paragraphs even mid-sentence. As such I found myself having to constantly *HUNT* for the continuation of a sentence. Many times this involves flipping more than one page. Who has time for such nonsense?Yes, write a new addition. This time get an editor. A highschool student in a journalism class could do a better job."
1,Not worth the price,Do not buy this book unless you are a professional trader working on the floor. Extremely hard to understand. There are many other books that are much better suited even for the professional traders. This book is a waste of money for 99.9% of the people.
2,Phd Required.!!,"All I can say is....""Is there a book available that explains the same concepts at a normal human level?"" I have been studying and trading options for several years and I have a BS degree in Physics and in electrical Engineering, but this book is like taking a Phd course and is just as dry.I am disappointed."
1,Taleb's book is derivative(bad pun intended) of much better>,"works on the subject. Risk management is non-existent and in general the writing smacks of another pseudo-academic attempting to differentiate himself by alluding to the significance of six sigma. His claim_to_fame, as it where, relates to his derisive-comments relating to VaR, his condemnation is far too simplistic, IMHO. Much better books on the subject, avoid ""Dynamic Hedging"""
1,Waste of my hard earned money.,"My favorite class was calculus in High School and College and this book was way over my head. This man is probably related to Albert Einstein and his book is only good for floor traders that trade 1000's of contracts at a time and only make 5-10 cents per contract.If you goal is hedging options and futures, don't waste your money on this book. There is much better stuff out there. If you want to get bored with a million numbers, this is your book. (I always loved numbers until I openned this book - I never finished)"
3,Advanvced Text - Very Interesting,This is a fairly advanced Text on options. Taleb jumps right into option Greeks from the introduction.It is mostly oriented towards institutional traders and as a person with exposure just to equity options it goes right above me. So I had to go back and forth with Wiki to understand what he is talking about.You could see traces of Fooled by Randomness and Black Swan as he deals with various risk issues.Little bit pricey but goes to show even professional traders use broken models to invest millions of client money.My personal experience is Fundamentals of an equity affect its option pricing more than Vega/Theta/Row. Delta and Gama are somewhat in play. Taleb calls them liquidity holes but mostly it is Fundamental analysis.If a company has a massive debt restructuring coming up then options will behave differently before and after the event. Even Beta changes after the event.
3,Warning! Don't watch this with your wife,A young Anthony Hopkins and Clare Bloom give wonderful performances in this stirring paean to woman's lib or something quite near the edge of domestic apocalypse.
5,Sir Tony was terrific in this!,"First off: Anthony Hopkins is in this. Or SIR ANTHONY HOPKINS (the definative Dr. Hannibal Lecter from Silence Of the Lambs) If that were all I saw, I would have purchased this film. But, as it turns out there is further merit in a sophisticated plot. A DOLL'S HOUSE is a thrilling drama. When a woman ( Claire Bloom ) is confronted with a little forgery she did - - signing her husband's signature, she expects that he will stand by her. Matter over. But, her husband and their home take on a terrible twist. Dynamic story twists and excellent performances. Based on a play by Henrik Ibsen."
3,Not appropriate for young toddler,"It's a cute flashlight and works great, but hard for a toddler to turn on & off. My son is [...] (about the age they like Winnie the Pooh) and LOVES all lights, but he gets frustrated with this flashlight because he can't turn it on and off himself. It's actually become our emergency flashlight around the house."
3,Great for travel,The Berlitz Phrasebooks are probably the best in their class and this one for Russian doesn't disappoint. There's a small dictionary and the book is very neatly divided in to chapters relevant for travel. The book is small and very concise so there's no fluff here. I would recommend a book on culture prior to traveling to Russia but for lugging around this one's the best.
2,A little funny but mostly stupid and pointless,"In my opinion this book is definetly not worth buying. I think the most stupid part of this book is when Billy, the main character has to throw up on the cottage cheese monster to kill it."
5,Excellent!,This is a wonderful DVD and as a Heat fan it's definitely something to grab and treasure for some time to come!
2,Average everything,"The girls miss the point of a striptease, slowly undressing with erotic body moves. These girls of average looks walked out and dropped all their clothes and went into non erotic body moves, almost arobic. No eye contact or smile or interaction.Another point of striptease is 'look at the camera'.La Toja Jackson put out a similar series of national strip clubs on a cable movie channel, and those ladies were HOT !!"
4,Well worth it!,This is what live music is all about. Dubbing get's out of sync with the video in a few places; but the performance is incredible! A must for Blugrass afficianados.
2,s.k.'s worst ive seen so far,"needed to be funnier on newer material and more material-via 2 short a film where it was the same done a lil different via sams spiel which was good and the dude tossin him a music demo tape for his own fame for sam 2 c-sam was mean, as usual a lil different good phone thing at end. sams not funny when hes so grosse for so long or too grosse on sx. if he were sillier on sillier and newer and more intellectual material including more oh"" yelling, hed b more funny. sams best so far-live aka breakin the rules and fam. e.t. hr. banned ok and y did we laugh ok due to rare clips and some friend interviews were good."
2,"engaging, but too narrow focus","This book is engaging, but the reader should be aware that the focus is limited (mostly NY, MA, Jerusalem). Where is the fabulous library of Coimbra? or the hidden charmers of Leiden? or even LA? Too much time is spent on showing a child's wide-eyed wonder at encountering books. That is a noble undertaking, but not the one implied by the cover of this book. Ironically, this book titled, 'Library' will wind up at mine as a donation."
2,No subtitles,"While the box and the DVD states there are subtitles in both English and Spanish and the onscreen menu has ""Subtitles"" as an option, I was unable to get into this option on either of two DVD players. This option was just skipped as if it was not there! I have found no way to get the English subtitles to work. If you know Spanish, this looks great. If not, and you want to understand what goes on.. By the way I had the same problem with an other DVD in this series, El Duo de La Africana"
3,Be sure you want full-frame,One of the reviewers comments that the Dreamworks website shows that the set is widescreen. I can't find that information on either dreamworks.com OR Shrek2.comBut if you check out http://movieweb.com/dvd/dvd.php?678149194227They seem to have the information correct and it looks like only the 3-D feature is in widescreen. THAT is going to stop me from buying this set.
2,Wait for 5-movie collection of Shrek,"If i remember correctly, Katzenberg was quoted in an interview stating that Shrek was planned as 5 movies in total. 2 are available so far. 3 movies more to go. The last movie is supposed to deal with how Shrek came to live in the swamp (prequel story).Anyways, instead of double-dipping, we just have to wait until all 5 movies are out in a super-duper collector's set. And this time, hopefully, Dreamworks will get it right and release separate WIDESCREEN and fullscreen versions."
2,The story so far... but only for small screens !,"When Dreamworks released the first Shrek movie a few years ago, they bundled both the Full Screen and the Wide Screen versions in one single package. This time around I believe they have become a little greedy because the only widecreen version included is the short Shrek 3D film.Very disappointing. A Deluxe box set should be... Deluxe !"
1,Pan & Scan Abomination.,"This set is a disgrace. ""Fullscreen"" (read: Pan & Scan) !?! What is Dreamworks thinking?Avoid."
1,No Widescreen?,I was so excited to be able to purchase this and rushed to the computer to do so. I won't be buying it now. Why make a big set of dvds with lots of extras if the films aren't widescreen? What a waste!
1,shrek-story so far,I can't believe that dreamworks has gone through all that trouble to put together a cool set and then sell us short by making it only in full screen. why would you do that? brutal!!!
1,Wha you should all really be thinking about,"You are overlooking something, Shrek sucks! In any format..."
1,Look closer,"If you look at the details it says ""FULL SCREEN"" for the movies.So while this looks like a great package, why would you want the movies in Full Screen?"
1,Thanks for the warning!,"Amazon: If you sell a version that has been altered from the original, you MUST make that clear in the listing! It is not enough to mark the individual discs deep in the fine print.I didn't pick up on the format problem until I glanced at the forum. I would not hesitate to return the package and demand a refund if I had ordered this thing by mistake. Thanks, all, for saving me the aggravationLet's get this straight. I won't buy ANY full-frame edition (unless the original is 4:3) because I really hate the idea of some schmuck panning the frame and superimposing his/her sensibility over the director's. And the Shrek films are totally professional, not throw-away kiddie drivel. They deserve some respect."
1,Fullscreen - Yuck!,"I wish I'd come here before I bought this set. I found out too late they were all fullscreen, and of course, once opened these things can't be returned. I've had to pay for the movies twice now, just to get the widescreen, and now I am really pissed off. Kinda ruins the movie for me, now that I have to think about this every time I watch it."
5,Great Movie Set!,I read the reviews on the Shrek collection of 4 discs and found quite a bit of discrepancy. All discs ARE full-screen. They are not wide-screen. They are what Amazon says they are.Shrek is a great movie and it is cool to have have this set!A great purchase!
4,Widescreen,"As far as I know, Shrek comes as a 2 disk set. Disk 1 has the full screen movie, Disk 2 has the widescreen version. I do hope they have a widescreen version of ""The Story So Far."""
1,Was ready to order today,"I love these movies and I was ready to purchase this special 4 disk set. However, Full Frame only???? No sale."
3,Katherine Jenkins,"I fell in love with Hayley Westenra and Celtic Woman. I was looking for another artist who sang that type of music. In this I was very disappointed. Hayley's voice is so clear, Katherine sounded very muddy in comparison."
5,"True Voice - Angelic and Majestic. Others just yodel when they can't hit the note, high, lows and Decibel power.","The DVD default plays audio DOLBY 5.1, it will sound muddy and flat.The best way before you make a review, is- select the DVD setup to DTS 5.1.- Hopefully, you have a DTS system.Listen @ runtime 21:00and @ runtime 29:48If the sound distorts or muffles thenyour device is BAD for reviewing."
4,Two tone greatness,"At first listen these cd's are pure gold. Great variety of sounds and bands and if you are trying to get into two tone it's a great starter. However, there are a rather large amount of repeat songs and it kind of ruins it. This is the only reason i give the set 4 and not 5 stars. It's definetly worth your 20 bucks though and i definetly dont regret getting this set."
1,Not straight-forward enough.,"This book was almost as bad as a college text book when it came to bombarding the reader with boring, sleep-inducing jargon. I had to take notes and do some research on-line to figure some things out. More examples, less technical talk, and reminders in small text boxes of previously learned concepts would have definately helped."
1,chemestry made simple,"PLEASE PEOPLE, PLEASE.....DO-NOT-BUY-THIS-BOOK!---THIS BOOK IS A RIP OFF, THE HELL WITH IT! THERE IS NOTHING SIMPLE ABOUT IT PLUS NOTHING MAKE SENCE, I WOULD ADVISE TO ANY SELLER TO STOP RIGHT NOW! THE SELL OF THIS BOOK."
1,Did not fit----skip it,There is no way in creation to get this device to fit without hacking large portions off. I'd say skip it.
3,Mindy,This cutting board is really pretty but the texture makes it difficult to cut up fine things like herbs.
5,Cutting board,Great product. Exactly what I wanted. will order more when I want different scenes... Looks great in my kitchen..thanks again
5,Cutting Board,"This was bought as a Christmas gift, and the receiver really liked it! It was a good buy, compared to what I found locally. Rich design."
5,Adorable!!,A fun adventure with great illustrations! The animals actualy pout when they can't come along! My three year old loves it!
5,Darling Book,"This book is darling, the story is about animals crowding into a canoe with a little girl. The animals are all from the north woods, the pictures of them are very cute. The animals won't listen to the little girl when she tells them that there is no room in her canoefor them. They all climb in and the canoe tips over. I have a cabin in the north woods and this book is perfect to read my grandchildren."
2,Messy,Acts more like a thick grease pencil. Tip gets out of shape. Not sure I would use this on anything that needs to look decent.
4,Pretty good,"The pen writes with a permanent mark, and it's great for labeling tools and such, but if you are concerned about streaking, you have to be careful since it's really difficult to patch up the uneven marking that this pen sometimes does. Still, overall, it's a good product."
1,"""Without Leaving Home"" ? This book was absolute GARBAGE !!!","Did the authors realize that over 80% of the Colleges they put in this book require some ""on-campus"" requirements? Suppose I live in New Jersey and attend a school in California,and I'm required to be on-campus 2 times a year for a week each time, HOW is that considered ""Without leaving home"" ? Some Schools in THIS VERY BOOK require students to attend weekend seminars 3 to 4 times a year!!! Can Somebody do us all a favor and recommend a book that has Distance Education with ""100% NO ON-CAMPUS requirements"" ? Please Change the TITLE of the Book. Going from Maine to Arizona DOES indeed require travel."
1,This book did not even include programs I knew about.,This book appeared to review a random sample of programs. It did not even include two programs from leading Universitites that I already knew about. The book was worse than worthless.
5,Hear this Angel's Voice!!!!!!!,"When I heard Anthony's voice for the first time, I thaught his voice is so beautiful and peaceful. If you want to hear angel's voice,hear his voice as me!!!!!!! You'll think so like me.When you hear his voice,you can feel Heaven!!!!!!!"
2,Unusual fit,"I love Rockport shoes, but the Ashburton with the squared-off toe looks fashionable but is too long for each given size; and the side panel brushes (irritates) my ankle bone. I wound up with the Rockport Hancock Place, size 9 1/2 M (my usual size is 10 M) and am delighted with them! L. Albert"
3,narrow,"Order this shoe wider then usual. I never have to order wide, and did not do so this time and these are too skinny. Otherwise a good shoe."
3,Kinda weak.,"The premise of this book is neat-o. Unfortunately, the characters are flat and unclear, and much of the story wanders unfocused with only flashbacks of the main character's childhood to pin it together. The ghost element was barely there; it was more of a tacked-on catalyst than anything. The ending was wishy-washy, like the author wrote the real ending but chickened out and softened it. There was probably a good chapter and a half in there that I really got into. Oh well."
4,Tony has a pleasant voice,"I found this lp recently,and gave it a spin.I feel that the jazz back up is tasteful,and that Tony sings mostly on key and with feeling. He apparently loved to sing,and the choice of standards here are well chosen.His voice has an Art Garfunkel lightness,and sounds one step away from very professional.Had he continued as a singer perhaps he would have made the grade.As a personality he was an interesting intelligent man,and the phrasing is pretty good.I've listened to it a few times,and like it."
4,The good and the bad...,"This was a great book it tied in to the 40k (Warhammer 40,000) universe extremely well. The book details a lot of change of a lot of characters, and these changes kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me reading. The action in the book could have been a little more compared to other books in this series. If you are new to the 40k world there are two other book you need to read before this one is going to make sense, this book is number three in the Horus Hersey series, which I think it is up to 23 book now!Now the bad.It isn't available for the Kindle! And this is annoying. So a note to Black Library Press and Amazon, can you guys please work it out, and bring these books to the Kindle via Amazon."
5,Fantastic Finish,"This was a fantastic ending to a great trilogy. What makes it extremely appealing as a reader is that three different authors were able to make such a great story that flowed very well. The action is non stop and the story line is intriguing. The only gripe that I have with the book is I wish Counter had spent more time talking about Garviel Loken, seeing as he was such a focal point in the first two books. Otherwise, a fun read."
3,"Eddy Howard's version of ""To Each His Own"" CD",All went well with this order which is being used as a gift for a relativewho has been fan of the song and Howard for many years....Everything connected with the ordering/delivery/etc. was easy and processed aspromised -- I will continue to order through Amazon for all my like needs....Thank you.
4,Interception by Graham Watkins,"Fascinating story of a female psychologist looking into the (then new) phenomenon of online dating and romance. After a patient's spouse leaves their marriage for a new love found online, Dr. Andi Lawrence decides to find out more about the online romance idea. The man she meets online, and decides to meet in person, don't seem to be the same guy. Maybe this online dating thing is for other people, or maybe there's a lot more unseen going on in cyberspace!"
2,Disappointing,"A friend loaned me this book. I'm not a sci fi fan but she is.It started well, but about halfway through I started speed reading to finish it. I am wondering if the author is trying to cross over from romance novels; that's the overall impression left by the book. I wouldn't bother."
4,For British Comedy Fans!,"If you love Monty Python, then your sure to like this. The movie does have a plot but sometimes it sorta feels like there isn't one. That being said, it's a hilarious, strange, a ""what on Earth did I just watch?"" type of movie."
5,You've Done It Again!,"I am more and more impressed with what Geri King is doing with each release. I have both of her previous releases and love them both but this one has the total package. Great songs and Great delivery! I believe that this album will do well in todays market. If you are looking for a Great R&B songs with a timeless, you should hear Lifetime or Tears You'll Never See (tracks 9 & 3). They both have messages that many can relate to. Don't get me wrong, the CD as a whole is wonderful its just that I can really relate to these tracks. And for those who are tired of being told what to do with your life need to listen to the lead off single My Life. The CD is awesome and I recommend that R&B lovers pick it up and add it to your collection of Great music with timeless value."
4,Fairly good book.,"It doesn't help a whole lot, but it is a good companion to the software. Seeing that Microstation doesn't have a tutorial package like a SolidEdge, the book does a decent job to fill that gap."
1,Don't bother!,"I thought this book might help me with Microstation, IT DOESN'T.In summary, if you printed out all of the help menus from microstation, that is exactly what this book it. It does not provide any additional information, explanation, or tips. It is just as useless as those help menus are, because they are exactly the same thing. It was a waste of money!"
1,Not for HD camera,"I bought this lens for my HD video camera (HD-SR12). It ended up creating a round keyhole effect. This lense is for standard cameras but in HD format, it is not big enough to cover the field of view."
2,Low budget,I am sure the message and the intention are wonderful. The music is too loud and a poor choice for the movie. It seems poorly put together. Unfortunately.
5,Touching For All Ages,"I was given a copy of this book for my daughters and it became a family favorite upon its first reading. One night while I was curled up with my daughters reading, someone very close to me overheard the story. When I turned the corner after finishing the book, he was in tears - touched by the sentiment of the book. I purchased the book for him for Christmas. Needless to say, it is now read twice a night in my house."
4,Five stars for the book - soft toy okay,"I love this story and had the book when my children were younger. I think the message about love is beautiful and my children always enjoyed the story. I have purchased different versions of the book as baby shower gifts for friends. This version is a sturdy board book which comes nicely packaged with a soft toy bunny. The packaging of the two items look great for presenting as a gift. I am a little disappointed in the toy bunny. It's cute in the box, but I don't know if it's really suitable for a child under 3 to play with. If nothing else, it could be used as a nursery decoration until the baby is older. I highly recommend the book and also this version with the toy bunny with some reservations about the age level for playing with the toy."
5,My FAVORITE book!,"I love this book, and I love board books so much. This will be perfect for little baby hands to hold onto while mommy reads! This is the best story in the world. I grew up having my mother read it to me and my sisters, and I was so excited to give this to my sister for her to share with my new niece! LOVE IT!"
2,For the older baby?,"We received this as a gift for our newborn. He's now 15 months and still won't sit still past the first page of this book. Perhaps he'll enjoy it as he gets older? If you have an infant, I would strongly recommend ""Goodnight Moon"" over this one."
4,Just right,"""Guess How Much I Love You"" is the perfect present for a little boy whose Dad is a Marine currently serving in Afghanistan.Guess How Much I Love You"
2,"Boring, just sits on our bookshelf.","I thought this book would be great based off of the reviews that I read. However, this book just sits on our bookshelf. It's boring and there are far more interesting and engaging books for children available."
3,...,I was happy with the book however the last page has some spots on it. It doesn't effect the story it's just not as perfect as it should be being a new book.
2,Not as kid Friendly as I thought,This book did not keep my son's interest at all. He is 2. I was quite disappointed at this book.
2,"""I""m the parent, I can outdo anything you say""","Little Nutbrown Hare (why couldn't he/she have a NAME?!?!?) LOVES Big Nutbrown Hare. Okay. BNH loves LHN MORE! No matter what LNH says, BNH's response is MORE. Translation: you're sweet, but no matter what you say or do, I'm better. Lousy message to send a kid. The ""love"" part is fine, the comparison & competition is not."
1,Weird message - competition=love?,"This book had a great review online, but when I received it and read it I could not believe the message. I think the author had good intentions of showing how much the parent loves the child. However, every time the child says how much he loves the parent, the parent one-ups him. The parent always has to have the last word. It's just odd. I don't know how this story got to be so popular."
2,Ugh.,"Honestly, I cringe when my kids pick this particular book for me to read for them. Try repeating ""Big Nutbrown Hare"" and ""Little Nutbrown Hare"" 15 or so times and you will understand. (Then do it every night for a week.)"
2,More interesting to the adult than the child,"""Guess How Much I Love You"" is a nice simple story about a parent's desire to express his love for his child. We have had this book since the birth of my daughter and have read it to her on different occasions. However, it is not a book she pulls off her shelf to be read to her. Usually it is the adult visitor who oohs and ahhs over it and insists on reading it. The plot is just not interesting enough to hold my daughter's attention through the whole story nor to draw her back to it repeatedly. The book presents a lovely theme, unfortunately the story itself does not hold interest."
1,"Boring illustrations, and unproductive storyline.","The idea of the book is cute, but like others who have reviewed it here, I'm not a fan of the storyline: trying to ""out-love"" another person with no real point to the story.Also, this was given to us when my son was about 12-18mths old, but at that age, I prefer illustrations where a ""face"" is easily discernible, and ideally, colorful. These pencil drawings are so pale and small, an *adult* can barely make out the hares' faces/expressions. As of right now, this book bores him. And even when he can follow the storyline, I'm not sure I want him to!!So, this is a ""filler"" book on our shelf that rarely gets read. It's just not much good for kids who don't speak yet, nor is it any good for their self-esteem if they CAN understand the message, ya know?Update: my son is now 4 and it still doesn't hold his interest -- probably give it to the library next time we go..."
5,A great book to read aloud to your little one,This book was my favorite bedtime story when my kids were younger. We had fun going back and forth telling each how much we love each other. The illustrations are also really nice for little ones.
5,Great book for reading readiness...,This book lets you learn 44 vowel-spellings using 227 vocabulary words.
2,One-upmanship by a parent,"This book is creepy. I bought it myself for my daughter because I think it's a good idea to talk about how much parents love their children. But I'm uncomfortable that at every turn, the father hare has to outdo the child hare. That doesn't seem like love, that seems like competition. I'm glad so many people like this book, and that's fine, but it doesn't work for me. I like the style of the writing and the drawings. I just think it's possible to write a book about how much parents love their kids without making it a competition between them."
4,One of our favorite bedtime books,This is one of my daughter's favorite bedtime books. I always ask her how much I love her and she holds her arms out as far as she can. This book really shows the wonderful relationship between a mother and child. It will always have a special place in my heart. As a note to teachers: I really enjoy reading this book to my class.
5,Beautiful!,"I don't have any children of my own, but I absolutely love to share this book with people I love, young and old. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a short book to share with someone they care about."
5,I Love You all the way up to the Moon - and Back!,"Big Nutbrown Hare is putting Little Nutbrown Hare to bed. Little Nutbrown Hare tries to tell his father just how much he loves him by stretching out his arms, by hopping really high, and doing all sorts of funny things. With each illustration his daddy, Big Nutbrown Hare uses the same illustration that his son did to express his love even more to his little one.In the end, Little Nutbrown Hare finally falls asleep while his father tucks him in bed.It is a very cute story that is easy and quick to read, but that children love. I feel they can identify with Little Nutbrown Hare in the way he expresses his love to his father. I think it also reassures the child of his parent's love. It is a really good bedtime story.In addition, the pictures are adorable. It is VERY well done! This book is very reasonable for a board book and well worth the money!"
1,Illustrations Are Beautiful,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that this book's weakness lies in its message to the child. No matter how hard the child tries to express his love for his father, it never measures up to his father's love for him. This completely invalidates the child's love. I really don't know how this book has gotten to be so popular . . . could it be marketing? There are other books out there with which parents can explore their love for their children and their child's love for them in a more positive way.That said, the illustrations are beautiful."
1,This is love?,"I just don't see what is so heart warming about topping your child's statements of love. It all seemed very negative and competitive to me. I felt that the parent was trying to show the child that his expressions of love were inferior. This book has a lot of hype surrounding it. There is the expectation that a parent HAS to like this book, that it is somehow profound. After all I had heard, I expected to like this book. The undertone of the book was troubling, however."
1,Big nutbrown hare demeans little nutbrown hare over & over,"I'm sure the author had the best intentions in writing this book, but he failed miserably. No matter what the little bunny says, the adult bunny one-ups him. Others have written about this already, but I cannot see how anyone finds this a positive book when the adult is so competitively focused on ""proving"" that he loves the little bunny more than the little one loves him. (What, pray, do you get by winning this argument anyway? A child who thinks, ""You're right, I don't love you all that much.""?)Moreover, my 2 year old is bored stiff with the story. It's not the length - he enjoys longer stories such as ""Harold and the Purple Crayon,"" ""No Roses for Harry,"" and ""Corduroy"" - it's the content. This book should be avoided by any thinking parent."
1,I did not care for this book.,This book did not keep my daughter's attention. I did not care for this book either. This book makes it seem like there is competition to see who loves the other person more. It is not what I expected.
3,Not for my two year old,"My son who is two had no interest in this book and he loves all types of books from Dr Seuss to the Byron Barton vehicle series. This book was too wordy and slow moving. I also thought it was confusing that the character in the book is a ""hare"" which is a tough word for a toddler that is already figuring out why sometimes they're called rabbits and other times bunnies! Anyway, we'll save this one for later."
3,Can't keep my daughter's attention,"As much as I love this book it can't keep my daughter's attention. I even read it to her in the womb. I had heard when you do this the book you read will often be your child's favorite. It was not true with my daughter. While I find the book calming and sweet, my 17 month old just finds it boring and I have to fight to keep her in my lap when we read it. I have given up and hope she will come to love it as she gets a little older."
3,"Cute book, but what's with the names?","Very cute book with pretty illustrations and an adorable message, but what was the author thinking with these names? ""Big Nutbrown Hare"" and ""Little Nutbrown Hare"" have a loving competition about who loves who more, but it gets really tedious for both me and my toddler while reading this book to constantly say such long names. He really can't relate to what a ""nutbrown hare"" is, and frankly, I feel like most kids would feel the same way. He recognizes them as ""rabbits"" and perhaps the author might've considered just calling them that (or giving them palatable names?)"
3,Go right to the big-kid version,"Yes, yes, it's a wonderful story, full of love and warm cozy feelings, and of course it brings tears to my eyes every time I read it . . . but there are too many words, not enough colors, and it's just not interesting enough for a very young child. We read several books a day in our house (sometimes several dozen), but, as patient as he is, my son just won't sit still for this book. I have great hopes that he'll love this story in a year or two, but by then he will have outgrown board books. So, in short, you should certainly buy this classic, but don't expect to be able to read it to a toddler! I'd skip the board version and go right to the big-kid book."
5,"Wonderful, sweet, a precious classic","Story and illustrations are wonderful, and fun to read. This has been a favorite book of my daughters for a couple years now.... always making an appearance in their hands every couple weeks to read again and again!The story is sweet, and started a little game between us where one of us says ""I love you more!""... than the other says, ""no, I love you more!"" and over and over again. Silly, yes, but that's the fun in it.This is a fun and warming story... leaves a great feeling in the parent and the child when reading as a bedtime story. This one is sure to leave the child with good dreams. Enjoy, and look into other Sam McBratney books if you like this one. They are all wonderful."
2,confusing for little ones,"Whilst the message in the book is very sweet, the way in which the book is written is difficult for a toddler to follow:The mum and baby are Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare, which said repeatedly gets confusing because they don't hear the big / little part. I guess you could change it for Mum and Baby say this that or the other, but that's not the point here.Of all the books we have my son never chooses this one."
5,i love it,"this is a great book and my baby loves it, he gets excited when i read it to him, i would def. recommend this book"
3,Cute story.,The story is very cute but for it's very wordy on each page for a board book...my 10 month old's attention span can't handle it. Haha.
5,VERY CUTE!!!,I love reading this book to my daughter and telling her how much I love her. Great book!!!
5,Excellent,Great book. I read it to my daughter evernight before bed as a child and will always be part of our lives. Great fast purchase
5,Beautiful and touching story. Perfect for bedtime reading,"This book is perfect in every way. From the beautifully simple illustrations - to the touching and well known contest that kids and adults share...this book will bring hugs, smiles and tears of happiness. Guess How Much I Love You is the perfect addition to every child's bedtime story collection."
5,10 Stars from us,"This is a wonderful book. I love it and my son (15 months) does too. He and I act out some of the ""guess how much""es. Great illustration and a durable board book."
1,How to invalidate and belittle your child.,"A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship. The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word.That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse."
2,Competitive love?,"The pictures are cute; I liked the illustrations of the active little bunny... The trouble with this book, in my opinion, is that it makes love competitive -- I didn't really like the way the whole thing is kind of a battle of one-upsmanship. The fact that the book ends with the bigger rabbit insisting on getting the final word in kind of bothered me. I guess to some people, it's an endearing book, but it sure didn't work for me!"
2,"""Am I not good enough?""","Although my children (ages 1 and 3) have loved this book very much and requested it as a nighttime book for months now, there is something I find a little disturbing about this story. I know that the ""oneupmanship"" theme is a big part of this book, but as I read it, I feel badly for the little bunny, who no matter what he struggles to come up with, can never seem to be good enough for his father. I realize that that was not the author's intention, but there is something to be said for letting the children ""win"" once in a while to build their self-confidence. I'll bet that Little Nutbrown Hare's love for his Daddy is every bit as strong as his Father's love for him, even if his arms aren't as long and he can't jump as high."
1,Simply horrible,"This book is terrible and I can't understand why so many parents think it is so great!!! If you really analyze what this book is saying, you'll see that it plainly says that no matter what your child says or feels or expresses, the parent is always better. The parent is always bigger and always outdoes the little nutbrown hare. I read this to my child and couldn't believe the message I was sending her. I will never read it again. In fact, giving it one star is generous. I will be tossing this book into the trash to take it out of circulation. Every child should be made to feel as though his or her feelings matter just as much as someone who is older and bigger."
1,BAD!!!!,"Ok,Yeah.This book is sad and it deals with a rabbit whos mothe loves the father more? THATS NOT RIGHT!!!!! Love isnt about compition,its about loving your child no matter what over every one else. ""Love You Forever"" is a better book......check it out sometime!"
1,Guess how competitive the parent is,A Horrible message. The parent rabbit constantly competes with the baby rabbit on how much they love each other. One of the worst children's books I've ever seen. This book is for parents that think they are better than their children and have to prove it - time and time again. ARGHHHH!!
2,Did not entertain a 2 year old,"This book didn't really entertain the two year old I bought it for, and I can't really blame her. The illustrations are not particularly colorful or engrossing. The story is also kind of boring for a really young child and the message will probably be entirely lost on one. Frankly I think this book is more for the adults reading it to children they love than for the kids themselves, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of."
4,What More Can One Say?,"A delightfully illustrated board book with a lovely reminder for all of us who love children. Children can not hear ""I love you"" too often. The board book formats allows some abuse while passing on an appreciation of books. The illustrations capture the imagination and are an ideal accompaniment to a lovely book."
5,This book is great!,"I always read this book to my nieces and could not wait to have a child of my own so I could also read this book to them. I wuold always ask my nieces ""Guess How Much I Love You"" and each of them has their own way of letting me know. I am now starting to do this with my daughter. My daughter is only four months but she loves it. She looks at the pictures and will actually stay still for me to read the entire book. I highly recommend this book. I will warn you though that this book may cause a couple of tears."
5,A must for all new Fathers of sons!,"As a new father, aside from Kipling's poem ""If"", I have yet to run across another work of literature that can so strongly convey my feelings for my new son. Every time I read this book, I am not simply reciting, I actually MEAN the words that I am saying! I have little doubt that I will be reading this book to my son for several years.To sum up; if you are a new father, this should be the first book you acquire to read to your infant."
5,A Good Cuddle Up Book,"I cried the first time I read this book and I still get teary eyed everytime I read the last line. It is a wonderfu,l warm book perfect for anytime you want to quiet things down and reconnect with your child. WONDERFUL"
5,Great little book! Sure to be a classic.,"This is a great little book, and is sure to become a classic. We had several ""board books"", including this and other classics such as ""Goodnight Moon"" and ""Runaway Bunny"". The tale unfolds at a comfortable pace, and is soothing enough that it makes a FANTASTIC bedtime story. We always seem to end it with a yawn, not because the story is dull but because it is relaxing.My son particularly loved this book, and he and my daughter still like to quote ""I love you to the moon and back"". The nice thing about board books is they are sturdy for little hands, and make the pages easy for young children to turn. They are also easier to wipe clean if something gets on them. Over time, they become not ""worn"", but ""loved""."
3,Good for older babies able to sit still for a while.,"I bought this when my daughter was 7 months old. She liked looking at the pictures, but simply couldn't sit through the entire book. I often found myself skipping pages to get to the end. I think maybe around a year she'll be able to sit through the entire thing."
4,Great kids book!,"Perfect for those who are shy about saying ""I love you"". Book makes it easy to express feelings with children. The characters in this book show a simple yet fun way of bonding between dad and child. My kids LOVE this book!"
4,Sabas Love,Another great book for your pre-school child or grandchild. Promotes concepts that they may already identify with such as big and small. Puts into words the concepts they may already have about the love they're constantly surrounded by. I heartily recommend it.
5,One of our favorites,"I read this to my daughter when she was little & now at 13 she's just become a big sister & insisted her little brother have this book, too. Very sweet book & it really is timeless."
5,HAPPY CHAPPY,THIS Book Was a birthday present from my dad wheni was five! now i am 13 years and this is still my favorite book. Big Hare resembled my Dad and little Hare resembled me!I would recomend this book for all ages it is a easy read and has very heart warming pictures.i just want to say thank you to sam mc Bratney and anita jeram for this lovly book.yours sincerly me
5,Guess How Much I Love You,Very cute and very sweet book about the concept of love and the relationship between father and baby. One of my favorite.
3,great for little ones,this is a good book to share w/little ones and make them feel loved and special.
4,Very Touching For The Adult Reading It!,"This is a good book. And I only say good (not great), because it is more touching for the adult whose reading it than to the child. My son liked the book - but really never 'got' the message of it. It is a good nightime/bedtime book - with happy thoughts."
5,Hare,I love this book - the illustrations are adorable. A simple little story to read to a tot before bedtime. A little book to be treasured.
5,wonderful book,This is a must have book and a great gift to for new parents. The illustrations are wonderful and the story does such a great job of illustrating a parent's love. This is a book that children enjoy and parents love reading again and again.
1,Bad message,"I disliked this book SO much, the parent in the book is practically competeing with his child. I especially hate how on the last page, the son says, ""I love you to the moon,"" and after he falls asleep, the dad says, ""I love you to the moon and back."" People wonder where kids get one-up-manship from."
1,"NO, I love you more than you can ever love me, so there!","Don't buy this book unless you enjoy belittling your child's feelings. The entire book is about the little hare telling the big hare how much he loves him, only to have the big hare trump what the little hare says with responses like, ""But I love you more (e.g. longer, higher, wider, farther, etc.)."" This book is going to the dumps."
1,Doesn't hold my daughter's interest,"Whenever I read this book to my daughter, she starts fidgeting on my lap and looking around for her other books. The illustrations are beautiful, but somewhat monochromatic (the hares are brown of course, but there's not much variety of background...). The other off-putting issue with this book is the one-up-man-ship of Big Nutbrown Hare. The book may purport to be about unconditional love, but Big Nutbrown Hare makes a point to show Little Nutbrown Hare that he's always going to have the last word and most clever reply. Based on these two factors, the book rates one star."
2,Very Hard to Read Aloud,"I found this book to be very hard to read aloud. The constant repitition of ""Little Nutbrown Hare and Big Nutbrown Hare"" is very tiresome and a real tongue-twister. Runaway Bunny is a similiar book and much easier to read."
1,This Kind of Competition Is Hurtful,"I use this book as an example of a bad parent figure. Big Nutbrown Hare competes with Little Nutbrown Hare as to who loves more. The parent figure disheartens the child figure by devaluing the little hare's feelings of love. At the end, after tearing up the smaller rabbit's self-esteem, he ""gets the last word"" after the smaller rabbit falls asleep, clearly unhappy. My kids feel horribly sad for the little rabbit at the end. I own the pop-up version of this book, but we rarely read it. I recommend ""Mama, Do You Love Me?"" or ""The Runaway Bunny"" over this book if you're looking for a good ""loving parent"" story. It could have been so much better -- real parents of young children appreciate the depth of love without resorting to competition. I do love the illustrations, though!"
1,Not the message I want to send to my kid...,"My husband and I have agreed to remove this book from our daughters ""library"". It is a story about a child that is trying to tell its parent that they love them. But every time the child tries to come up with a way to show them, the parent just keeps one-upping the child, instead of showing appreciation for what the kid is trying to say. The worst part is the ending, after the kid was shot down all day long, and he says to the parent ""I love you all the way to the moon"", and just as the parent is tucking in the kid, and the kid is almost asleep, the parent whispers ""I love you all the way to the moon and back"" ...as if to insure that they got the last word in. I really don't like this book..."
2,The father hare isn't a good example of unconditional love,"I am disappointed to see this book so frequently being compared to other loving ""classics."" It bothers me that, instead of accepting the little hare's love, the father hare feels compelled to always top what the little hare has just said. I can think of many other books (I Love You, Stinky Face and Love You Forever, to name two) that are much more deserving of the critical praise which this book has received."
1,Competitive parent trounces child's love,"The parent must always win. The parent hare tells the baby hare how he is loved. However, when the child responds, it's never quite good enough. The parent loves more, the parent's response is bigger and grander. The poor child never quite measures up to the parent."
3,This one is ok,"The whole family feels mediocre about this one, does help to put our little one to sleep."
2,A lone voice of dissent,"I hate to be curmudgeonly, but I didn't find this book heart-warming at all. What I got from it was a sense of competitiveness from the parent. Every statement the child made, the parent had to one-up him. For a good example of a book about unconditional parental love, instead read - Mama, Do You Love Me?"
2,Don't understand the popularity,"This seems to be another ""love it or hate it"" kids' title. Although the illustrations are kind of cute, I really dislike how the older rabbit one-ups the younger rabbit. It seems like an odd way to express love, even in a story. I would never give this one as a gift, there are much better (if less popular) books out there."
2,One-side oneupsmanship,"My husband loves this book (makes him tear up), and I understand the beauty of the ""I love you more"" game. But this book isn't about the little bunny and the big one one-upping each other in the "" I love you more"" game. This is about the little bunny thinking really hard for creative ways to express his love, and the bigger bunny one-upping him every time, often with his superiority (bigger, taller, stronger). It just doesn't seem fair! Any actual parent doing this to their child would be stifling. But it's just a story book. I can leave it to my husband to read it since he likes it and I don't."
5,Great for Dads,"This is my favorite book to read to my little baby boy. As a father, I find that many of the stories involving parents are told from a mother's perspective (for example, ""Where's Spot,"" which is also a great book). ""Guess How Much I Love You"" is all about a father expressing his love for his child. I absolutely love it."
5,Sweet and Simple Bedtime Story,"A simple, light story. The book has cardboard pages, easy for a young baby to turn. It's short, sweet, and a good quick bedtime story with just the right amount of sentiment.The words are easy to follow along and have a nice quiet rhythm. (Some stories [Dr. Seuss' stories] can be too upbeat for bedtime.)"
5,A warm and cuddly book for my daughter and I to read.,"A warm and cuddly book for my daughter and I to read together before bedtime. She has learned to jump, hop and stand on her head in immitation of this wonderful story. We will always love each other as ""high as the moon and back""."
5,A sweet story that's fun to read,"This is one of my favorite books to read to my kids. A sweet story of Little Nutbrown Hare trying to tell Big Nutbrown Hare just how much he loves him. The kids can get involved demonstrating how much the little bunny loves him, stretching out their arms, reaching up as high as they can, and hopping as high as they can hop. A real classic!"
2,Bigger is better?,"Every time the kid rabbit tries to express his love for papa rabbit, the big one has to one-up the kid! Even after the kid nods off, papa has to have the last word. What kind of lesson is that, I wonder? When reading it to my little one, it's hard not to make sarcastic comments along the way. Now that she's reaching the age of comprehension, I don't know whether to chuck it or change my tone... :-)"
2,Maass writes like a college freshman,"I was very disappointed by this book, as the reviews were quite good. Maass oversimplifies everything and his writing lacks both context and continuity. If you aren't interested in understanding what happened or why, read this book. If you want to have an understanding of the conflict, look elsewhere. Maass's book is a memoir of his experiences during the war, providing juicy bits of grotesque imagery- but no substantive analysis."
5,great book,The horrors of war are detailed greatly in this book.The war is normally not talked about in comparison to other wars like WW one and two.. or the iraq war that eclipsed this.
5,"Gripping, shocking, and simply terrifying!","This book showed how terrible the War in Bosnia really was. The media failed to show us the bloodbath that it became. I am sorry that we as a nation did not do more to help the Muslims in Bosnia. Whether we are Christian, Jew, Muslim, or Atheist we have a moral responsibility to help defend a small country from genocide. The shocking truth in this book opened my eyes but it also deeply depressed me. One is tempted to give up hope in the face of such monstrous reality. We live in a very unpredictable, hostile, and politically unstable world and Peter Maass shows just how evil it can get."
3,A walk in Bosnia,"This was not a bad book if you're looking for a journalist's point of view. I've been to Bosnia and Kosovo. This is a walk through Bosnia from a jounalist's perspective. It misses the historical background and any real analysis for actions of the Bosniacs, Croats, or Bosnian Serbs. The book is written with a Bosniac bias and is not objective."
5,"To the writer of the book ""Love Thy Neighbor"", Peter Maass.","May 5th 1999 - One surviver of Bosnian war -I read this book six months ago, and gave it to my friends who are from the same city in Bosnia as I am. I survived a part of Bosnian hell and will never forget it. The book gave me a beautiful feeling that there were people who cared about Bosnians during the war and did their best to inform the world about the horror which was happening there. The book is honest and I couldn't believe somebody has written it in the same way I would do it. I would like to thank Peter Maass from the depth of my heart and wish there were more people in this world who really care about our planet."
4,"Very good, dont listen to a 10 year old","beofre you buy this game keep one thing in mind : this is not a ""mainstream"" game..it's for fans of either the comic book, or people who liked the original game on the playstation, very weird fighting game but also very good if its what you are into. again, not a ""mass market"" game."
4,A blast that'll have you witness the smooth momentum of rap,"Tuff crew was a force to be wrecken with in the late 80's. Their hardcore genre has gotten respect from groups like Public Enemy, and those who look back on lyrical strategies that have layed the foundations to what is still refered to as ""dope."""
2,disappointment,"I've read other Michael Moorcock novel, and thought I would like this one, but I found The Skrayling Tree impossible to get into. I like a little complexity in my novels, but this one became convoluted and so hard to understand that I just gave up after a while. There was so much theoretical discussion about multiverses and balance and chaos, but not much emphasis on plot, and as a result this story suffered immensely. I didn't find any of the characters interesting. The one part that piqued my interest is when the characters went into Niffleheim, since I am a big fan of Norse mythology, but my interest quickly faded. Mostly I just wanted the book to end and I surprised myself by trudging through the finish line. Not an enjoyable read.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
1,How the mighty fell,"Johnny Burnette died, we're told, in a boating accident in 1964. Would it be insensitive to suggest that, having helped to set the world on fire as leader of the Rock and Roll Trio in the 1950s (see Rock Billy Boogie, also available on Amazon.com; you wouldn't believe it was the same person), he drowned himself rather than carry on singing this teenage idol dreck? On this album, only Sweet Suzie gives a hint of the real Johnny. Forget the rest."
4,It's tight.,"This album wasnt too bad. My favorite songs are See about ya, Doin it, Lets go, and natural stride. When vol.2 comes out, I might check it out."
1,Boooor-iiinng!,"This album lacks creativity, originality and inspiration. The rhyming style on the first song ""Alibi"" sounds suspiciously like Kanye's ""Spaceship"", doesn't it? (Biting is a hip hop no-no, shame on you). Whoever produced ""You don't want it"" should be fired, because that damn casio-sounding flute or string or whatever it's supposed to be is just wack. The production and lyrics throughout the whole compilation are way below average. I guess the Conduit crew thought they could throw some big hip-hop names on there and have a hot album. Well they were wrong. If I was Juvenile or David Banner, I'd be ashamed to be associated with this project.Big Bizness = big waste of time and money."
1,"Design flaw, will not carry anywhere near rated load","Axiom rates this rack as being able to handle 110 pounds. I had 2, 20 pound weights on it and the support struts started to bend. The problem is the two struts that come down to connect to the curved connector to the rear drop-out. The two struts are connected at slight different points and presumably the curved connector is supposed to flex to provide ""suspension"". Unfortunately, just riding the bike for 5 minutes with 40 pounds on the rack cause the ends of the two struts to bend so the rack is now useless. This is a very poor design unless you plan on carrying less than perhaps 20 pounds on the rear rack. The designers need to have a much better understanding of suspension mechanics!"
3,it's ok,"it's okay, pretty okay. funny in many parts.nobody farted a lot, so I appreciated that. and It was pretty ok."
4,Funny and Silly,"Few people have had the imagination to write a great story about the minute after you die. This one has a very Americanized look and process (all the dead people in this station of the afterlife are from the western USA.) It does make some fairly good points about how behavior on earth can have a bad outcome, yet the intent was to avoid a worse outcome."
5,"Defending, Defending your life",The dry humor of Albert Brooks left me with tears in my eyes. Meryl Streep is no phony baloney in this movie.
5,My wife and I Loved this movie!!,My wife and I always loved this move! and I would tell anyone if they haven't seen this move that it's a must see!!
4,"The film was terrific, but the delivery ---- not so much","The film was wonderful, well acted, well shot, witty and engaging. But my enjoyment was marred by periodic herky-jerky streaming."
5,Defending Your Life -- Bravo!,"A terrific movie for anyone, any time. It's been a favorite of mine for years -- the wit, humor, and wry sense of Brooks' irony never fail to please. But it is also an immensely comforting movie to see if you've lost someone close... We can always hope that death isn't final, and that there is joy in the afterlife."
4,Great Film. Great Cast. No Extras.,"I love this film, as I didn't own it on VHS, I bought the DVD.Great transfer, no extras. Less one star."
2,"I cannot think of anything more depressing than finding out in the ""afterlife"" that we have to go back.","Thank goodness that in the real life, we can choose to be with God forever. How could anyone not prefer this?"
4,"Good Story, Great Acting","I know this is an older movie but it is one that I always enjoyed. So I purchased an inexpensive copy and watched it again.I've often thought about how funny it would be to have a 24hr camera recording your life. Many moments, usually related to funny kid moments, would be great to capture and revisit. On the flip side, everyone has moments that don't want to live again but all of these shape who we are.I'm not a great movie reviewer but I will say that I love the creativity of this interpretation of life-after-death. It is humorous with a lot of satire at how we live our daily lives.Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep do a wonderful job of acting and the supporting actors are all great too.The love story theme is okay (with a kind of corny ending) but the concept of reviewing your major life choices after death is interesting and it is really all about the interpretation of them and the lead-up to them.A fun movie that doesn't have to be taken seriously."
4,What If??,This movie makes you ponder....What if?? There is quiet humor and a load of funny moments!! A great little movie!!
4,One of Brooks' best,"Thought-provoking and intelligent humor. Not only did I laugh, but it made me think about the choices I have made in my own life and determine to do better. Well written, well acted, well worth viewing."
4,Entertaining and somewhat thought provoking,"This movie does not follow the Christian belief of heaven or hell but more of a reincarnation philosophy much like the Hindu religions. It looks at each person's life after they have died and the person is judged on what good they did while alive. They are then sent back or forward based on the decision of the judges. The movie moved along and the acting was very good. The main characters were very engaging and did a good job in playing their parts. By the end of the movie I believe most people would be thinking of ""how will I be judged?"" in the background of their own religious beliefs."
3,It's ok...,"My wife wanted to watch this. It's nothing too special, but it's ok. There's some funny parts, and there's the romance part, but it's nothing to get all excited over."
5,Fun & Intelligent,I would ignore John G's comments . . . . . intelligence IMHO is more than the cerebral limitations of our finite human minds. That's what makes this movie so entertaining.
4,Judgment City,"This film is about a man named Daniel Miller who is hit by a bus. He dies and goes to a place where he can be judged so it can be determined where he should go from there. He meets a woman named Julia there whom he befriends. Daniel is directed to a courtroom where scenes from his life are replayed and the people in charge of his case defend and accuse his right and wrong actions.This film shows creativeness about what could happen after one dies, what it could be like in the afterlife before a person is given instructions on where to go next. It opens ones eyes to pay attention to how they treat others and how they react and respond to their lives in the present. There is a small amount of bad language in the film, which is the only reason why I gave it a 4 stars, although to some it could be considered light bad language. I viewed this film on my Kindle Fire and was happy with the quality."
3,No chemistry between Brooks and Streep,"I was disappointed with the movie, largely because to me it was totally unbelievable that woman like Streep's character would give the time of day to a nebbish like Brooks."
2,There are better movies to watch,"Not sure why this has such high reviews...It has humor but not that much and it's not witty or smart.The lead romantic relationship is probably the least compelling I've ever seen in a romantic comedy.Albert Brooks' character is not very likeable.The emotional content was heavy-handed and felt like a Hollywood cliche.It's not all bad, but there are definitely better movies out there to spend your time on."
1,Defending Your Brain,"Frankly, I don't get the attraction of this movie. I saw it in its first run; it seemed like another B comedy movie with an overworked plot and little character development beyond the usual hackneyed yucks and cheesy Hollywood sentiment. The theology behind it was certainly non-parochial -- it was incomprehensible and chaotic. Putting together a rich, believable and detailed theology that makes sense is not a job for the faint hearted, and certainly not a job for Hollywood screenwriters.The Wizard of Oz? Sure.It's a Wonderful Life? Absolutely!Kill Bill, Parts I and II? Well, ok, but send the kids to bed first.But this movie was just a good excuse to get out of the summer heat for a few hours. Nothing more.I don't understand all the glowing reviews, but as the French say: Chacun à son got (diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks)."
2,Unevolved.,"I expected more from this movie. Though the plot topic was intriguing; having one's life reviewed by beings of higher intelligence who decide if you can move on, it ""devolved"" into cheap cliches (heaven is a place in which one can gorge themself and not gain any weight... ugh, how pedestrian) and judgements based on whether one stands up for themself, nevermind being good/kind/generous, etc. Also, I thought the film was from a keenly male perspective. This somewhat oafish Al Brooks really does not seem all that charming, and I could hardly believe that Meryl Streep's character, the ""good hearted"" Julia, would be so entraced with his ""humor"" that she would find him irresistable and decide not to move on. All in all good concept and some humorous parts, but the rest was just...too unevolved to be enjoyable."
1,You better be perfect or else!,"This movie shows us that in order to move on to a better life, we can't make any mistakes. For instance, if you let a kid bully you in elementary school. If you are perfect and have saved people from at least one fire, you might get to go to Heaven. This movie makes me want to vomit with rage."
5,Do Not Return to Earth,"Albert Brooks, known for his non-mainstream movies, and also for writing, as well as performing in his own movies, shares the screen with Meryl Streep and Rip Torn in this charming story of what happens after we die.Whoever picked the actors for their roles deserved an Oscar, as the chemistry is perfect between them. The premise of the movie is thata soul goes to a Purgatory-type place and the previous life is prosecuted, defended and judged in a court of law as to whether it will move on to become a higher-intelligence inhabitant of the Universe, or go back into another body and try again until they get it right.Rent, buy or steal it, but make sure that you view it."
5,Don't be afraid to watch this film!,"If you can imagine at the end of your life a review is done, and this review is a reflection of how much you lived in fear or how you faced that fear and went on with living - then this is the film for you. It is very funny with powerful transforming ideas."
5,One of the Best Movies of All Time!,"Albert Brooks has written and directed some of the greatest comedies ever. Defending Your Life is truly his masterpiece. As much as I love Woody Allen, his work usually carries a certain cynicism regarding spiritual matters. Defending Your Life uses wonderful humor to express a positive view of New Age Spirituality. Mr. Brooks as a director and writer always brings out the best in his female characters. Meryl Streep has never been more appealing and shows real comedic chops in this film. Lee Grant and Rip Torn are also terrific in supporting roles. And of course Albert Brooks is his usual hilarious self in the male lead. My only complaint with him is that he doesn't write and direct more films. His last one LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN A MUSLIM WORLD with the great performance by Sheetal Sheth is another winner which left me anxiously awaiting what he will come up with next. Harve Mann 9/26/11"
5,ALL TIME FAVORITE!,"The subtle, intelligent humor is classic. Meryl Streep is wonderful and Albert Brooks is hilarious! Great entertainment without violence or foul language! I recommend this one to all my friends - an all-time favorite!"
4,Die laughing,"Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks as love interests? Preposterous! That's the whole point. As Streep personifies perfection, wit and poise, Brooks exemplifies tom-foolery. But wait!..they are dead! There's nothing more pitiful than reviewing your life and finding out you missed out (through luck or choice) on some crucial junctures. Let's face it, we're not all born to be Albert Schweitzers. So, loosen up, enjoy and live! Watch this any time you are feeling low or lonely."
5,An Eternal Favorite of Mine,"I lucked onto this book when it came out in 1998 and have found myself returning to it over and over throughout the years. I can't say that I've ever tired of rereading the same stories. If you want to feel yourself in Alaska, this is one book that takes you there. Great fireside reading!"
1,Problems with this discription,"There is no indication of the size of the binder. I had to order one to see what it is like. Amazons discription is incomplete. I could NOT find how to contact them, so I am using this means. A similar product was listed with the size, and cost more, so I assumed this one was smaller. Why no spell check on reviews?"
2,Not what you'd expect.,"This compilation isn't as good as it looks. The problem is all the ""punk"" on the 6 cds are way early and far from the greatest punk ever. The bands repeat and as far as punk goes, sounds much more tamer than the stuff that the 90's have harbored (ie bad religion, NOFX, Pennywise). I thought this was a punk album but it's really not. It sounds much more like a rock album. Not really worth the money unless you specifically like early punk."
1,designed for classroom use,"While this book does offer some good advice on the topics it covers it is designed to be used in a classroom setting with a teacher and other students. The book frequently asks you to compare your answers to those of other students and to check with your teacher for more practice assignments.The advice this book gives while good is also very basic and found in almost every other ""How-to-Study"" book I have seen. Since this book really needs to be used in a classroom and covers nothing that others don't I would recomend that you give it a pass unless you are in a course that requires it."
4,"Nice, but not intriguing","This book told about the childhood of the author. It talks about how her father who came from a Brahman family devoted his life to Christ despite his family's wrath. He lowered himself from the first and the most admirable caste to the lowest one. Her father died quite young, leaving her mother with her children. Saguna has 2 sisters and 4 brothers. Her sisters at that time had already married.So Saguna as a little girl surrounded by 4 boys, was influenced by the behavior of boys. She grew to be a strong willed young woman, stubborn and very clever. Her intelligent had brought her to be a special student of health, and she was granted a scholarship to study in England.Saguna was not a traditional Indian woman that we used to imagine. She was not obedient in a sense of slavery. She stood up to her will. She did not accept the faith of women whose jobs were in the kitchen. And she was brave enough to break every barrier that came upon her."
3,a good classic/basic baby monitor,"These units work as advertised but they do pick of a lot of 60Hz Buzz and Humm. I find laying he unit on its side or moving a few inches etc will help.These units are analog ( not digital ) and use the 49MHz baby monitor frequencies, thus if you expect to be able to hear a drop a pin in Jr's room these are not for you.If you want a basic no-frills radio to hear Jr moving around or calling for you, these will work just fine.The receiver units can run off AC ( via a wall-wart adapter ) or off a 9v battery, the transmitter is AC only.(note: The receiver units do not recharge their battery when you plug them, thus you may endup using a lot of 9v batteries when you accidentally leave the unit on all day)Pros: They work wellCons: very susceptible to Buzz."
4,Pleased,I am happy with this product. We have placed the base in several different areas of the house including the downstairs far corner and we can hear through the monitor just fine. Also placed it in the bathroom and you can hear the shower water running. No static! Great price and product.
1,author's purpose??,I was extremely disapointed in this book. The author's sole purpose for writing this novel appears to be striking back at members of society that disagree with a certain lifestyle. I bought this book to be entertained with a story of vampires and not to get drug down into a debate on morality or social choices. If you have a differing social opinion than the author you might very well find the novel unreadable. Please read everything writen on this page about this book before you buy it.
4,Great camera for the price....,"Its been a week since I have owned this camera. I think it is a great camera for the price(below $200). The picture quality is awesome and 3.2 MP is more than enough. The best part of this camera are the ultra zoom, macro and amazing battery life. I have taken over 100 pictures and all of them are very clear. The macro mode of the camera is very cool. The shutter lag is hardly noticeable and better than most cameras including sony. The only concern of this camera is it takes some time to adjust the focus at night, but the delay is not much either. The lens cap is completely detachable from the camera. So you have to remember it to keep it at a safe place. Of the cameras I have researched this camera offers amazing results for its price."
5,Good book for developing fine motor skills,"This is a great book for therapists, parents, and teachers. There are many activities and information on fine motor development."
3,Hatmaker shows why he is one of the best,This DVD shows the good and bad in self defense instruction.Mr.morris and Mr.Christensen attempt to use somewhat complicated traditional responses to self defense.I've been a cop for 12 years and as a Defensive Tactics Instructor I know that these types of techniques only work in the dojo or classroom for the average person.Mr.Chritensen should know this also.The 3 stars are for Mr.Hatmaker's block of instruction.His approach is to keep it simple.The things that he shows are much more easily retained and used under actual stress.This DVD is a very good way to evaluate varying styles of instruction side by side.If you want more than an evaluation of styles then I suggest that you spend your money on one of Mr.Hatmaker's DVDs.
5,A must for Dave Holland Fans,"I bought this album a while ago but it's still one of my favorites. The songs are great, especially Blue, a Jack DeJohnette composition and Rivers Run, a Dave Holland tune. There's also a Charlie Parker and a Steve Coleman tune, as well as a traditional song, African Lullaby. The trio format leaves plenty of room for these great musicians to stretch out.Enjoy!"
2,Inadequate shoe support mechanism,"I used this tool for 6 months during a major renovation. All started well and I was very impressed with the saw. The one short coming is the front shoe and the shoe holder. The mechanism that holds the shoe became looser and sloppier, causing the blade to cut into the shoe as it would rotate. The entire shoe support mechanism eventually just fell apart, rendering the saw unusable. Something a little more substantial is needed. I would be willing to accept a more robust shoe holder in exchange for the `inconvenience' of having to use a wrench to adjust it. A good motor and good blade change mechanism are offset by the shoe mechanism rendering the saw inoperable after only 6 months. Buy with caution."
4,Keep it dry,"I am on my third AVT sawall over a ten yearPeriod and am getting less impressed with every purchase. In the past I have owned the Bosch sawall which I would rate higher then the Makita, along with the dewalt, Milwaukee, and the skip sawall. The Makita is a awesome sawall until it gets wet. Once it's gets wet it goes in slow motion turning the speed to almost stopped. You can dry it out but time after time getting wet it seems to just kill the tool. Good luck and keep it dry."
5,Makita shines,I feel this is great value for money. I am in the construction trade and this tool seems to take all the beating I can give it. Great for the price too
5,I love this tool!,"I have had this saw for almost a year now and love it. I have used it to cut cars in half, trim trees, remove walls, cut a polished aluminum dash and much more and it has done it all without any problems. When cutting through wood this saw flies! When cutting the dash plate out of polished aluminum diamond plate I merely used a metal scroll blade and set the speed very low, a jig saw would have obviously been the better choice but I didn't have one on hand.My only complaint, as mentioned in a previous review is the rubber boot covering the blade holder. Mine has already become chipped, although not while I was using the saw. I am very careful with my tools and I'm sure it would have never happened to me, but this is most likely the week link in the durability of the saw."
5,A Necessary CD Single,"A rare CD single that is of some importance. Why? The Trevor Horn mix of Lost My Faith is killer. It's way better than the tepid version on the album. Trevor truely turned it into a single. Also, this track does not appear on the terrific Hits collection. So this is the only place to get it. The mixes are good for extended dance mixes. This said, I wouldn't pay 50 dollars for it!! If you're a big Seal fan, look for a 10 dollar or under copy and you'll be pleased you did."
2,Perfume,I received the item within a few days of placing the order. It was wrapped very securly and the product was what it said it would be. I was very happy with the order and my daughter loved her Christmas present.
4,Better than raking,Works wonderful on moderate level of leaves. Don't expect miracles if you only clean up your yard once each fall. I like to use it as a blower first and them just vacuum up the piles of leaves!
1,Leaf Vacuum,"I own one of these chipper, shredders and after 3rd. use one of the buttons on the bag that keep it closed fell off. Parts for this bag are not available so you must buy a new complete bag for approximately $200.00 I received no help from Sears or MTD customer service regarding this problem. I would never buy this product again."
1,Buy something else!,I've never written a review on Amazon before. I bought this product from a local store last spring. Really a bad purchase. Couldn't suck up anything! I was cleaning out my garage this summer and acutally put it out for the garbage man to pick up. I wouldn't even give it away to someone because I felt like I was just passing along a problem to someone else. Told the wife sorry about wasting the money...but live and learn.
2,Terrible accounting text,"The textbook is just poorly organized and doesn't begin to prepare you to solve the problems that are given at the end of each chapter. While it defines terms well it also leaves out explanations for most practical applications that are tested for in the problems. There is no way to check your actual work, since even the homework manager only provides solutions and not a detailed methodology as to how the answers were arrived at. It is amazing that this has survived to 7 editions without someone organizing the chapters and the material in some more organized fashion. Unrelated concepts are thrown in at the end of chapters with little explanation. If you want to learn accounting terminology this book is okay. If you want to learn how journal entries are actually recorded line by line look somewhere else. The explanation of debits and credits is perfunctory. This is not written as an entry level accounting text for non accountants."
1,Avoid at all costs!!!!,"I am having to use this book for an Accounting Grad class and it is perhaps one of the worst txt books I have ever laid my eyes on! Wordy doesn't begin to describe how bad this book is, did this go through an editor or straight to press? It just goes on and on and on throwing in examples that come later in the chapter, the examples are poor never follwing a simple path, and the questions at the end of each section are as bad as the book. This book reminds me of someone who decides to teach you something off of the top of their head, they didn't bother to make any notes or set a goal for how they wanted to approach the subject. Avoid at all costs!!!"
1,This book is very confusing,As a first timer to accounting I htought the book should have better explained the basics instead of rushing into so much complicated material. I feel in order to be able to understand this book I should have taken a basic accounting class first.
2,Forced to use...,We were required to use this text book for a graduate level accounting class... it is terrible. It has adopted a process of explaining accounting that is nonsense. It would be better to have the financial statements and have them explained in English than this process.
2,Not happy with this book!,"I think this book was too wordy for a text book. I believe this Accounting book should have had more examples and explanations of the examples to be able to work the problems at the end of each chapter. When you are trying to understand what the numbers really mean ""which is the name of the book"", I think you should go into more detail as to what the numbers really do mean and also how to get those numbers."
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. I found it long-winded and text-y. I was expecting an Accounting-for-non-accountants approach but I couldn't have been more wrong. The more I read this book, the more I wanted to buy another book-- Accounting for Dummies. Thank God for my instructor's supplementary materials for without those, I would truly be lost. Her presentations provide more concise, to-the-point information.If you are a non-accountant like me and you wish to understand accounting by your own terms, this is definitely not the book for you. Their exercises don't even have quick and available answers."
1,This text is terrible,"This book lacks effective structure, or comprehensible structure at least, and the writing is both tedious and meandering. Many of the examples are minimally useful and some are only vaguely associated to the concepts they are meant to support. Useless! This book wasted the time I had taken from my family to study accounting. Why would anyone select this text for a graduate level class???"
1,Very confusing text,I found this textbook to be very confusing. It doesn't spend enough time elaborating on each topic before it moves on to the next.
2,Leaves something desired...,"The book seems artistically flawed and long-winded. The approach is too formal for something which is ultimately very practical. Only one example company is used throughout.Stop settling, professors."
1,Magical numbers,"Bad text. Concepts are thinly explained. Demonstration problems have numbers magically appearing without reference, authors presume the student just ""knows"" where they came from. Problems are exercises are absurdly thin on relevant information, and the text does not give examples of many problem types.The one plus this book had is the free supplements on the Internet; even so, the supplements cannot fix this very poorly structed and written text.If you are forced to use this text for class, you will want to shop around for a 2nd text to explain this one."
1,Terrible,"I wouldn't get this book even if you paid me to. It is terribly written, rambling on without any coherence. The problems at the end of the chapter are difficult based on the lack of information that is leanrt throughout the chapter. You will surely need to go to the book's website to access the solutions to odd problems for the problems at the end of chapters. My cousin is an accountant and he said that there aren't many books that will teach one accounting well, so do you yourself a favor and grab an CPA accounitng book and just do as many examples as you can."
1,Terrible Graduate intro Level Accounting Book,"I have had it with this book! Not only am I taking an online course, with no step by step explanations or student/teacher classroom interaction, but I have to use this book that does nothing to ease this situation.The Chapters delve into definitions and some simple example at the end, but then when you get to the exercises, its like where in the heck would I have learned to solve this problem in this chapter? From the definitions?My suggestion is to by a supplemental intro accounting book in order to complete the exercises in the back of this one."
1,Worst Accounting book on the market,This book on the market could be the worst Accounting book ever made. The examples don't do enough to solidify what accounting is really about. As an undergraduate or graduate student that knows nothing about accounting this book would confuse everyone trying to understand. It's the worst book I have ever used in a Business class.
2,poor book,"I find the book hard to follow, mainly because its fill with boring facts that aren't relevant."
1,False Advertisement,I find it interesting that what I once thought a great company (Amazon) has decide to stoop down low like other seller on the internet. I purchase a textbook for school online from you which was advertised as a new product. To come find out AFTER I received the book it was USED. A new book comes with online access as part of the books fee which I ended up paying an additional $40 for. In the past if what I wanted was available from Amazon I would usually buy without question but now I will have to reconsider my options and will most likely shop elsewhere. This would not be an issue if you had listed the box as USED rather than new.
4,The Religion/s of Mesopotamia,"Bottero offers a fairly concise review of Mesopotamian history and religion. The book is a good introduction to the topic for both students of religion, as well as general readers. My original interest in the book pertained to the correlations between Mesopotamian mythology and the stories found in the `Old Testament,' i.e. my interests were more literary than historical. Bottero does discuss some of the myths, etc.; yet his main focus is on religious practices and/or behavior. It's still an interesting read, and, overall, I enjoyed the book. But if you are, like I was, looking for an analysis of the Mesopotamian myths themselves and how said myths influenced the entire Mediterranean basin, I recommend the book ""Slaying the Dragon"" by Bernard F. Batto."
2,Where's the Beef???,"I use this text in a college course I teach and I would give it less than a C. The authors attempt to cover a wide range of material, but they fail to correctly present critical material even when informed of their mistakes. The book does contain links to useful web sites and is current on many of its topics. However, on the subject of diversity and EEO - they need to stick to the facts and not what will sell books. Too many errors for a text this costly."
2,delivered late and not what expected,I ordered a human resource book and it took 9 day when you said 3-5 business days. I thought i was getting a hardback book but when i got it..it was paperback with small print and black and white pages. I have sold books via Amazon but this is the first time buying and it was very disappointing.
3,go tuff crew,"heres another tuff crew cd,i dont mind these guys,all thoo i rekon they never got the attenion they deserved,anyway a good album from 1 of philly classic crews"
5,tuff crew,"great cd, old school philly rap group. i grew up listening to tuff crew and this is there best album. classics like ""my part of town"" make this a must have cd for any old school rap fan. i recomend this cd to anyone that has not heard tuff crew."
1,INCOMPREHENSIBLE. Don't waste your $9,"I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, so I'm used to very technical texts. This pamphlet, however, is so incomprehensible (to everyone except the author, I suspect) as to be useless. I would have gladly paid 10 times the price for a useful explanation, but unfortunately this thin booklet falls far short. The author provides complex tables, with no instructions or examples on how to use them (as though it was obvious...but it is not). Even the few examples given in the book are impossible to follow. What is needed, is a ""compass corrections for dummies"" type of book, replete with step by step examples which this book sorely lacks. Don't waste your $9 on this book, it will be better spent on beer."
5,Ha Ha from HA HA,I read the chapter about phone sex to my friend Bill over the phone and he had tears of laughter. Dave Barry used to be this funny.
3,First Book Much Funnier,"His first book, Municipal Bondage, was much funnier. This one is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but I didn't fall over on my couch laughing the way that I did with the first one."
4,Nice Work If You Can Get It,"I felt somewhat sorry for this author, despite the fact that he probably did most of these things with a book contract in hand. A lot of the funnier moments, though, come from the pain. I was truly happy for him at the end, when he got his job on the VH1 show, ""Rock of the Ages."""
2,Ho hum,"I guess I managed to finish it, but there are no belly laughs in this book. Maybe there are for those who really appreciate the subtleties of the rather-seeming world of priviliged gay New York artistic types, but I guess I am just not hip to that scene. The man can write and clearly has a good eye for the humorous side of life, but this just wasn't the hysterically funny book earlier reviews had led me to believe."
3,O.K DVD,"This DVD is very basic. The content is ok, but limited. Also, it doesn't make sense to call a DVD ""volume 1"" When it is the only one you have produced. I was hoping it was the beginning in a series, but this is it."
1,Dead after 3 uses,"I bought this device in late December, 2010 and used it for a few low-voltage DC household and automotive investigations. The last time I used it was August, 2011 and then I discovered in October that the meter would no longer turn on (I tried 4 different brand-new batteries because I didn't want to believe that it was dead already.) For the handful of times that I used it, it worked fine; it just didn't work for very long."
3,"OK meter, but fuse doesn't protect the meter from mistakes","This meter worked great until I switched it to capacitance range instead of Hz (right next to each other and plugged it into 120V to check the frequency on a generator. It blew the meter up, first the digits went out then the screen went totally blank. There is no fuse in this model that I can find. There appears to be a 200ma self resetting breaker and that apparently didn't do the job. My fault for selecting the wrong position on the dial, but on most meters protection/fuse would have saved this failure. When it was working it was very accurate and a pleasure to use. Probes are OK, display is large and easy to read. Backlight was nice. I' likely try the MS8268 which appears to beep and light up if you are on the wrong probe and setting combination which might have saved me from my mistake."
1,Junk,"Broke the 3rd time I used it. But since it was more than a month old Amazon gave me a refund, minus the ""Free Shipping"" charges. So no replacement, and several $$ in the hole. Not a lot, but...... Anyway, should have paid attention to the previous reviews."
4,Top Chef: Chicago,The show itself is well done. However the supplemental material is not very well done. There is also a problem in that after viewing the supplemental material it is very difficult to get back to the main menu.
3,Good season but not worth the price jump!,"Not have seen some earlier seasons of Top Chef, I purchased Season 4. It was a great season and worth the $11.99 I paid for it. I was dismayed to come back to the site 2 weeks later to find out that the non-HD seasons of Top Chef, which were $11.99 or less, are now $20-25! And the HD ones are now double the cost they were! Season 4 was entertaining, especially Richard, Antonia and Stephanie, but would not be worth purchasing at the sudden higher prices."
3,Good protection but clip is worthless,I must be tough on clips because I have never had one last more than about 3 months. This unit was no different. Does seem to keep dirt and grit out.
2,Too much of a 'body glove'.,"This item is NOT good for a Motorola V3 Razr. Everytime I push it in, it turns the camera on."
4,Do NOT buy from BarginCell!,I tried purchasing this item from BarginCell but they were unable to complete the order. Over a three week period BarginCell refused to answer mail emails or answer or return phone calls. I had to complain to Amazon to finally get the order cancelled.After the BarginCell fiasco I ended up making the purchase directly from Amazon. Amazon was able to deliver the item on time. The Body Glove Case fits my Razr v3 perfectly. It is designed in a way that does not obstruct the camera lens when opened or closed. There's also a cut out for the charging port. The belt clip seems secure and there's a locking mechanism that allows the phone to be quickly released from the clip. It's a little bit of a tight fit when first putting it on the phone but once installed it works great.
4,Can't be beat at any price!,"1. It fits great and looks terrific.2. I have dropped the phone several times with no resulting damage do to the heavy vinyl from which the case is made.3. The flip-up clear plastic liner over the LCD screen allows easy cleaning of the screen.4. The clip works well but takes the strength of a gorilla to squeeze it open. It finally broke after just 3 months of use. But in all fairness, I've never owned any case with a clip that did not eventually break. Fortunately, generic clips could be had for $5 for a package of two bought locally.5. As I mentioned in item #1, it fits good...and tight. Remember, it's made by Body Glove, not Body Bag. So caution must be exercised when removing the part that covers the upper phone (which I do when I'm bored, not out of necessity) as to not rip the case or tear the phone itself in half by accident.6. Compared to other phone covers on other phones I've had throughout the years, I would buy another Body Glove case in a heartbeat!"
4,"Does what I want, plus a bit about Amazon pricing","I bought this Body Glove Radical Case from Amazon for my new Razr V3T. I wanted something thin but protective, and something that would give the phone a good grip. This does the job for me. The Razr has a slick finish which makes it difficult to hang on to. Prior to the Razr, I had used a Motorola V300 and a Motorola PEBL, both of which had a nice tactile feel.Amazon pricing is once again, shall we say, interesting. I bought from Amazon to take advantage of Amazon Prime Shipping, and it was $10.99 about 10 days ago. Today I wanted to buy two more for my kid's phones, and the very same Body Glove via Amazon is $12.30. Hey Amazon, give us a break! I even went back to my order that showed $10.99, clicked the link there, and it is now $12.30. Hmm, is this like the slots, should I delete my cookies and try again?"
1,"Unreliable, sucks","I'd give this one a 1/4 star just because of the price, but as the adage says, you get what you pay for. Don't trust your phone to this holder. Had it less than one week, clip broke and cell phone is now GONE. Don't waste your money or be prepared to lose your phone."
3,Body Glove,"The case is wonderful however, the clip broke after only two months. It would be nice if you can just purchase a replacment for the clip."
1,poor quality,only 3 days and the cover for the top had ripped.. can i exchange it?? i'm a cingular wireless sales rep and promote your product.
4,Great protecton for the phone,"The phone body glove fits the phone very well and I had no problem putting it on the phone. It is not a bulky cover and maintains the slim design. With out using the belt clip, it fits easily into my pocket without making an outline. The clear plastic does a good job in protecting both the keypad and the inside and outside screens. I have tried other covers but, this is the best one for the razr phone."
4,Pretty nice for the money,This case is actually very good if you are trying to keep your razr from scratching and to keep your phone looking brand new. The only thing about it is that the sleek looks of the razr are actually lost when you put this on as it makes it look a lil bit bulky. But then again that's the only way it can protect it. I would advise that if you still want to be able to show your razr get a pouch instead of one of these cover-all cases.
5,awsome product,well i've been using this product for quite some time now and i think it is the best case ever made for the razr. I don't have to worry about getting it scratch or anything. I would recomend this product to everybody. Thanks again for a great product. And for the price can't beat it either!!!!!
2,Not Impressed with this case overall,"1) I don't like the case release on the bottom of the clip.2) The quality is not the best and it can scratch your ear when you are talking with the case on.3) The case is not designed correctly. The case is a just a touch too small and does not fit the razr v3 properly.4) Description says it fits the razr v3 and v3i. Case doesn't even fit the v3 to my satisfaction so how could it fit the v3i.5) I got this case for the protective plastic, but dirt, fibers, and other junk got underneath the plastic so it was all in vain. Instead I bought the protective plastic to go over LCD's and keys. Works much better than case plastic covering.6) Bottom line, find another flip case and pay more to get a quality case."
3,not as sturdy as I would like,"The cover was fine at first; however, when I needed to remove it from the phone the top portion split where it is secured to the face plate"
1,body glove misfit,Nice looking cover but would not fit razor flip phone...very poor quality control if they can not fit one of the most popular phones out there. Not happy as one might imagine.
3,Underwhelmed,"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews and was underwhelmed. While it is not bad, in many places I found it dry, confusing and disjointed. I did not particularly like the mix of historical fiction and history. I thought that those fiction vignettes undermined the actual research while not adding anything of interest to the story. Many chapters were devoted to Nero and Roman politics of the time, which was relevant but seemed like filler since it did not contribute much to the Pompeian narrative.Overall if you haven't read anything about Pompeii I would recommend Mary Beard's work which provided much better and more engaging look into the life of Pompeii."
4,Learning from the ruins,"This book takes a very close look at the buried city of Pompeii, and the type of living that went on in it prior to, and at the time of, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It goes into great detail, and even has some fictional episodes done in italics to give more of a flavor to the work. It tended to be a bit dry at times, which cost it that last star, in my estimation. On the other hand, you will learn a great deal that you didn't know about life in Pompeii, and by extension, other parts of the Roman Empire during and shortly after the time of Nero."
3,Cuddle Duds,Wow this is the 4th time I have ordered Cuddl Duds tops for my mother and I NEVER get the same product twice - BUT I WANT TO - what is up with this??????
1,Don't waste your money on this item!!,If your are really serious about staying warm... stick to real thermals and keep the layers coming. This is just a boring under garment disguised as thermal wear. Don't fall for the hype!
4,Buy a bit large!,"These are GREAT! -- but they do shrink a bit, so plan ahead! Keep you really warm and are very comfortable! Be prepared to shed them though when you move into a warm zone or you will melt -- they are that effective!"
3,Good starting point for Win2k AD...,"If you plan on purchasing Directory Services Passport book I would recommend using this book as a quick overview before taking the 70-217 exam because that is the way it is setup. If you follow the MCSE track and the 70-217 exam is your 5th or later test in the track, this book will really become a redundancy of the information you have already learned. The information in it is very easy to read, almost too easy. To save yourself some money when you want a good starting foundation of Active Directory (in my opinion) is purchasing Mastering Windows 2000 Server by Sybex/Mark Minasi. You will get the same information with all aspects of Windows 2000 covered and a more enjoyable read."
1,I never received it now what,I never received it now whatI have to say this is my first trouble w/ amazon but they are ZERO helpful
5,Comfort!,After a long day of kayaking my back muscles are tired. Having some back back support in camp is so important and comfortable and this chair fits the bill.
4,wonderful camping chair,"i used this chair in the north georgia woods for 3 months while i hiked and camped. it is comfortable and easily carried. it isn't a huge chair and it folds in half for many options on your pack. however, i'm a taller guy and i needed a taller back b/c the support poles poked my back. the chair is not water proof, so sitting on wet ground will usually result in a wet [...]."
2,know why they call it Crazy!,"...because it's a total joke! I'd rather sit on a boulder or my duffel bag. I'm a fit guy with a 33"" waist. The sides of the chair compress my legs together while the bottom front cuts off the blood supply. It's just as uncomfortable as it looks in the pictures folks. People who say this thing is comfortable must be smoking something around the campfire! Don't waste your money! I gave it two stars because the nylon material looks somewhat durable, although I could never imagine anyone wanting to use it long enough to wear it out."
3,was not as described,"The description states that it has a mesh pocket as well as a bottle holder- this is not only stated on-line, but also on the tag that was on the chair. However, it is ""just"" the chair- no mesh- no water bottle holder. As it would have been too costly to return and then re buy and repay for shipping we just kept it as it is going to be used up at camp in a bit over a week and we also were pressed for time. Very disappointed that AMAZON would not replace- that we would have had to get a refund and then purchase again as who knows if that would have had the pocket and holder."
3,"Performs admirably, but not as well as they used to","I've used Crazy Creek chairs for roughly 20 years. The older ones were built better than the ones available here, with more robust padding and support bars. These newer chairs are more flimsy and less supportive, but they still get the job done. I'm sure people new to the chairs wouldn't notice the difference and would like the new ones just fine, but as a long-time customer I'm a little disappointed."
2,Hardly Worth the Price,"The best thing about this book is that the CD contains an environment where you can script projects -- like the example game -- in Lua. The example game itself is not stellar. In fact, it ran very poorly on my PC, which is a new state-of-the-art game development system. The actual scripting presented in the book is not particularly elegant. That is, the title is written more from a hobbyist's perspective than the POV of a professional developer. In order to really learn Lua, you would be better off purchasing _Programming In Lua_ and talking to other Lua programmers on the Lua forums (http://www.icynorth.com/forums/index.php?c=8)."
3,okay,not the bulbs I ordered/advertised - return was easy. Only a low score because I didn't get what I was hoping for...
2,Quite a disappointment.,"This book was a disappointment. The cover picture is great, but inside, it's what most owners of one dog already know. It doesn't get into the real dynamics of having multiple dogs, but tells the owner, they will have to train two and have more vet bills. Most people would already have figured this out. I recommend ""Feeling Outnumbered"" by Patricia McConnell if you want more information about multiple dogs."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book offers a clever title . . . and little else.This book contains very little practical advice about multi-dog households. The majority of the book is general dog info (i.e. first aid, medical care, feeding). Beyond that, the author spends far too much time gushing over her own pack of German Shepherds. For me, this was irrelevant and not applicable at all to my own situation."
4,Lots of Fun with Sea Life Busy Cube,Our Children's Library purchased this play cube to replace a similar one that was showing wear and tear due wear and tear after seven years of playtime.The children at our library really love the sea creature themed activities and we have had kids from toddler through elementary be curious and interact with it. I love the bright colors and that it is see-through. Not thrilled about the animals maze side that can be difficult to manipulate.Overall we would recommend to families and other businesses.
2,"Buggy, slow and missing basic features","Punch is not really useful for anything than a very rough mock-up of a home, and even then it is buggy and slow. For example, it is possible to crash the software and get your model into a state where you can't edit it by putting in small wall segments on the outer edge of the house (while outlining the basic shape). It has a very slow refresh when any amount of design information is entered, so that it takes forever to redraw the screen (this is on a quad core i9). The floor height settings are broken, if you put in a certain height, add a few walls, and then change the height, you are out of luck - time to start over from scratch.Overall, this is little more than somebody's buggy pet project. Don't touch it with a ten foot framing beam."
2,Limited Uses,"This is not the software you want if you need detailed or professional plans.For general layout or landscaping it is ""ok"".While it has support for details of foundation, piers and beams but lacks support for electrical and plumbing other then placement of basic fixtures.The software has no support for importing or exporting any other drafting formats."
3,"good software, but needs help.","I first purchased this software while in college for a class project. We had to start a buisness, name it, hire employees, and manage it within a three week period. One requirement was to have a presentation at the end. So I used this software to design my car dealership. It did produce a good visual and 3D model to use. The software is a little hard to use, the colors are off, and the included extras (cars, funiture, tv's, ect.) need to be updated to this century, and heaven forbid that you try to create your own extras, the creation wizard is more geared toward a engineer than someone who is building their house for fun.I see that version 5000 is out now, hopefully they have improved it from the previous version."
2,Not a Substitute for Design Training,"I reviewed this software when a client of mine showed me his attempt to design his own house addition. The only thing this did for him was lock his mind into something that really didn't work as well as other options which I offered later. I hate to see people thinking that a program like this is like a designer standing next to them, which is how they promote it. If you're going to invest all that money in your house, why would you let an amateur design it?"
4,Blues Magoos - 'Psychedelic Lollipop / Electric Comic Book' (Collectables),"Another great 2 lp's-on-one CD release brought to us by the Collectables label. Some of you may not remember much about the Blues Magoos. They were a Bronx five piece that played some decent psychedelic garage rock that released six lp's from 1966-70, with the first three probably being their best work. This 2-on-1 includes two of those three albums. A total of 22 songs, starting off with their only hit, ""We Ain't Got Nothin' Yet"" along with many of their other decently penned tracks, like ""Gotta Get Away"", ""One By One"", ""Pipe Dream"", their outstanding six-minute cover of ""Gloria"" (one of the disc's best tracks) and ""Let's Get Together"". Aimed at fans and collectors of '60's psych / garage rock. Will appeal to fans of Shadows Of Knight, Strawberry Alarm Clock, The Creation, The Leaves and Count Five."
3,PSYCHEDELIC LOLLIPOP/ELECTRIC COMIC BOOK,"This collection,of their first 2 lps they released features their singles plus all their album tracks.It also comes with a precise history and pictures of the group, plus a reproduced sleeve of their electric comic book lp sleeve.This collection also includes a different version of one by one which is a bit slower but the words are more clearer on it. I have only given it three stars because even though they released some brilliant singles these 2 lps lack something.But still a collection worth having at a good price."
4,Florida Classic Club Song,This song is the bomb and is still being played in the club down here in West Palm Beach and since its an older song it is harder to find and I see that Amazon has it but never have it in stock.
4,Music for relaxed atmosphere,"Very nice, relaxed, and warm music. The artists exhibit exceptional musical technique. This album is recorded in special recording method which enables realistic sound in your room."
3,From Back Cover,"When Tyler Sheidan discovers through the personal ads that her groom isn't planning to show up for their wedding, she thinks it can't get any worse. That is, until she hooks up with seriously sexy P.I. Nick Romano to find her erstwhile fiance... and ends up wishing her groom had taken out his ad sooner...Nick Romano has had it - with the detective business and with women! But when gorgeous, desperate Tyler shows up at his door, what can he do but help her out? Only he'd never guessed how good they'd be together - in bed and out. But a future isn't in the cards for them. Especially since Tyler's still wearing another man's ring...3rd in The Personal Touch series."
1,Poor translation of a major novel,"This translation--unfortunately the only one of the Sand Child-- misses the mark in conveying an accurate representation of Ben Jelloun's novel. There are a number of glaring errors and omissions of original text. If it is at all possible to read the work in the original, one must. My rating is of the translation, not the original."
1,Too confusing,"This book aimed to be revolutionary, but is too confusing and becomes less and less interesting throughout the pages. If you want to read something enjoyable... choose another book."
5,Great for database students,"I bought the Volume 1: Desktop Edition during my second semister of Access at JSRCC. The first 5 chapters helped me get an ""A"" in the class. Chapter 5 Access SQL is Great, giving me a lot of help with my Oracle class that I am taking know. Any database student should have this book."
5,Just gets better and better,"I learned with the Access 95-97 sets. Unbelievable how reader friendly these guys present things. Each new version just gets better and better.The authors' abilities to create an overall level of understanding is great - they go the extra step to not only tell how to do things at a basic, very understandable level, but why things work the way they do and how they relate to other facets as well. They do it in a way that is not boring.The tools alone are an unbelievable wealth of resources.It is obvious they have worked hard to improve their product with each new version. This is not just a run of the mill basic how to book that never gets beyond ground level - it takes one to a higher level of competency that most books never attempt to address.It's all one needs."
5,Worth reading,"If boundaries are unclear here is a book for you. Examples, questions, and concrete answers allow for direction all in black and white and clear answers. I like the scripture references also. Good group study material. I purchased the workbook also."
5,Boundaries,"Excellent, Bible based resource for those having problems with relationships. Helps you organize your life and create an environment for mutual growth and respect."
5,Good book... life changer,"I am so happy I bought this book. It has so much information. It is a book that needs study... not just a read. I grew up with alcoholic parents and very codependent relationships. I am glad there is a Christian and biblical based book that speaks to the fact that when you are a Christian loving on people it does not also mean you are a doormat for others to take advantage of. God gave us boundaries and the ability to determine what is good for us to protect us. It is up to us to flex our muscles in this area and listen to our still soft voice when the answer is ""no"" and say it. It is also a comfort to know that God is smiling down on us when we stand our ground, understand our own personal boundaries and protect our hearts the way God would want us to. My prayer is for abundant wisdom to all who read this. It is definately a life changing book."
5,boundaries,I love this book. It has help me so much. More i read this book the better i feel and feel stronger about myself. This book help you in every part of your life. Home Work everyday life it great.
2,Not very impressed.,"bought on recommendation of Dave Ramsey,not impressed with the advice, writing, or examples...also the religious tie-ins were too frequent and out of context."
3,Good ideas but don't agree with everything.,"The book is a good concept and there are good ideas and thoughts intermingled, but I didn't agree with a lot of things they said. The biggest part I disagreed with is dealing with kids' boundaries. But I think everyone has to decide that for themselves. I felt what they said about kids would lead them to become brats. On the other hand, I learned some things about my own boundaries that helped me to deal with my own parents."
5,Fundamental Life Skills!,"I read this book a year ago, loved it, devoured it. I thought I absorbed it at the time, but now a year later, I find even more concepts from the book sinking in. The concepts in this book have saved my life. They are also now helping me raise my child and enrich my marriage, as I am currently reading the other books in the series, ""Boundaries in Marriage"" and ""Boundaries With Kids"". I recommend this series to all human beings, regardless of religious belief. The tools found in these books can truly help you achieve a peaceful, fulfilled life!"
4,helpful,"I found this book to be helpful to me as I am encouraging someone who is struggling in a way that boundaries are needed. This person is reading the book and together we talk about how it can be implemented. I believe it is helpful for any relationship or situation whether it be marriage, work related, family or friends. I would recommend it for everyone."
4,Life Changing Book,Amazing book. Someone mentioned it will change your life and is very true. Will change life of people without boundaries. Gets little boring in middle but comes back right up to speed. Repetation of steps are there all through out the book which is good for imbibing the concept. Great book!
5,book is perfect for anyone with boundry issues and even not,"for those like me who think God left it up to me to do his work and for others who just don't know how to keep someone out of their space, this book is perfect. it was a life changer for me. now i just remind myself ""boundries"" and know that God didn't leave me in charge down here, that he is in charge and working on al situations. it let me know that i am interfering with his work. i can now sleep at night knowing that he is in charge and that it's not up to me to fix up everyones lives"
2,Condones spanking children,"I was very much into this book until I go to the part where the author says that spanking children is necessary at times. In my opinion physical punishment is a severe boundary violation - if it were not for that, I would rate this book higher as I like everything else he writes. Dr Cloud seems wise, genuine and caring but his words on spanking seem inconsistent with those qualities - that was a disappointing shock to me."
4,Very helpful,"This book helped me to think through and understand my relationships so much better. That was an invaluable service.""Thank you!"" to the authors."
2,Interesting somewhat,"I ran into a girl that had read this book. She loved the book strongly. I became interested because of her strong beliefs. Some things she said showed the book had not helped her in some ways.The book talks a lot about defferent kinds of boundries. The book takes a religion viewpoint on everything. It also tries to cover everything. There are few ideas that are not covered in the first part of the book. The author also wrote 4 or five other books on the same theme.How much subtance is in the book? Well, maybe a page or two. Why did I give it such a high rating of two stars in place of one star?I did like some points the book made. He won me with the story "" of a wall around your house or a fence with a gate that would open and close"".I probably did not get enough out of the book there were only a few points and you had to hunt to find them. I may have skimmed too much.There are probably much better books to get but I do not have a suggestion."
4,Great concepts,"If you can implement the advice from Boundaries into your life then you will be better for it. The book explains why it is appropriate to sometimes say ""no"" to people. Some of the fictional examples are unrealistic and detract from the good advice (a woman tells her boss that she will not work on his last-minute project, and as a result she is promoted and her former boss is assigned to be her assistant). The authors like to quote scriptures to support their ideas, but they jump between several translations of the Bible and you get the impression that the verses don't always say exactly what is desired. Despite that the book contains useful concepts and it reads well."
5,Wonderfully pleased,"I was very pleased with price&quick delivery of this wonderfully insightful book that every parent of adult,troublesome,still into your pocketbook children should read."
4,Excellent Resource,I wish that I could make all my family and friends read this book. Many of us are not raised understanding healthy boundaries. Cloud and Townsend do a marvelous job of outlining healthy boundaries and all types of relationships. Easy to read with great biblical references.
5,Great Book,This is book everyone should read. I learned so much from this and have given as a gift to many people. It's easy to read and apply in life.
5,Boundaries is a great book,"Although I haven't finished reading it yet, Boundaries is a great book and I give it 5 stars!!!"
1,Boundaries book,Product received was not the one advertised and/or pictured. The book that was received was an old version with the same title. Disappointed.
3,dentalmom,"This book had a lot to say, but it seemed so redundant to me. I am a christian, but this book quoted the bible so much that it became a little too much. good book overall"
2,Over 50% of book are quotes by Jesus or the Bible,"When this book was recommended to me, by my coach, I did not realize the level of references to Jesus and the Bible.If the main ideas in the book could be summarized without all the ""quotes"", I'd buy that book in a second. However, it is a challenge to read around the religion.I am currently looking for other sources of information on Boundaries that do not frame in a religious context. There are non-Christains who need help with Boundaries too."
1,shallow and sometimes offensive,"I like this book the least of all self help books I have read (20+ meaningful titles I didn't identify with the case studies or the spiritual guidance offered. The counselor who recommended the book to me had the same kind of ""Christian Psychology"" where mental issues were sins and used bible quotes along with some medical ones.The tone felt accusatory, lumping me the reader, with the worst attributes of boundary problems. Boundaries and Relationships by Charles Whitfield is a much better book on this subject, and it also addresses spirituality but in a gentle, healing tone."
5,Boundaries are Christian,Christians must set boundaries in order to perform really charitable and loving works.
5,Great book,"This book can be an eye opener to those who struggle through life wondering why life feels so difficult. This book will teach you how to notice what healthy boundaries are in relationships, how to change and set boundaries for a more structure and balanced life. It has a biblical basis which for me was welcomed. The book is recommended for 18yrs and older. I wish I had read this book at age 18. Very beneficial advice that can be applied to yourself. It's about making you better not changing everyone else."
2,Boundaries CD,"The content of this CD is great but the quality of the reader makes it very difficult to follow. I do not recommend the CD. I bought this as a gift for my mom after reading the book which was excellent. She likes to listen to books when she is working in the kitchen, however if there is any background noise in the kitchen at all (which there always is - dishes, running water, TV in the next room, etc.) then it is impossible to hear the reader consistently. His voice varies in volume and tone way too much."
4,Great info,"What can I say? this book is great. Great information on what boundries are, how they are created, how they can weakened and what to do to be the person you were created to be."
2,Boundaries,OkBook was in new condition but old book didn't look any thing like present day issues as for the cover and such
5,great condition and service......wrong edition sent,"I ordered the book shown, but received the older edition.. I reordered, and the same thing happened.....the wrong book came a second time."
5,Boundary Bible,Everyone should own this book. It is the Boundary Bible. It is a must read for every human being.
1,Harmful stuff in the hands of the wrong people,"Unfortunately, many Evangelical Christians fall prey to the latest fad of this uncritical sub-culture. The latest fad is defining boundaries. While there may be some helpful ideas here, many are based on plain misapplications of biblical texts. Basically, you can make the bible say anything you want and this is what the authors have done. And in the hands of the misinformed or the self-righteous or the arm-chair therapist, the material here can be used as a legitimate grounds to abuse people psychologically and spiritually."
1,True: Boundaries is always popular with boundary breakers,"This book was highly recommended to me by a female in-law who later turned out to be an appalling control freak with zero respect for others' boundaries.She ruthlessly used the material in the book as a weapon to invade and disrespect others.I'm afraid that kind of thing is all too common in the self help world. People who think they are ""too kind, too giving"" are often nothing of the kind. People who feel they are weak are often tyrants.People who feel their boundaries are too weak often run all over others in reality.The individual I referred to above is still choosing all her daughter's clothes at almost 15 years old. For some reason the daughter finds this infuriating.As for the actual material in the book I found it shallow and vacuous.If someone recommends this book, run - do not walk - to a safer place."
5,Great Tool for healing & growing,I have been sharing this book for years with various recovery groups. I learn something new almost everytime. People just love the practical suggestions in this book.
3,"Helpful, Christian-based","Well-done. The only reason I give it a medium rating is because it is Christian-based, which for me is not necessary for learning boundaries. Could be helpful for someone else, though. I give it a very strong, solid three stars. Hope that helps."
2,Not what I was look for ...,"This book was not the kind of information I was looking to read. Therefore, it did not meet my need or hold my interest."
5,Excellent.,"This is a wonderful resource for anyone even if you are not a Christian. Great everyday examples, simple principles, and simple concepts. Helps to clarify and demystify expectations, cognitive distortions from our family of origin, and provide encouragement. I am a counselor and use this in my practice."
2,"Boundaries: When to Say yes, When to Say No","From the online description and brief outline, this book looked like an excellent resource for teaching mentally ill individuals the skills to set boundaries. Unfortunately, it is full of Christian teaching/references. I cannot teach this in a diverse and secular clinic. I feel betrayed, somehow. Perhaps I can scan it and edit out the biblical agenda."
2,Terrible audio book. Superb content - buy the book instead!,"Great content - as someone dealing with the topic personally, the reader's voice characterization and assumption of the tone of the authors gives the message a tone that seems mocking and insulting to me. I can't imagine the authors intended this. I strongly recommend reading the book, though, and soaking in a new way of looking at life!"
5,One of the best I've read...,Perfect book for parents of young adult children...I have recommended to so many and purchased for a few of us confused parents...
3,A good read even with all the Bible quotes.,Thank you for this.Cloud addresses issues here about our personalities that have been ingrained. He lets us see that it's okay to say no and gives us quotes to salve our feelings on quilt about it. He also shows us pitfalls that are possible in our journey and makes it okay to fail and move on. (something I had never thought about before)For this I am grateful.Thank you Henry. You book will remain on my nightstand as a reference as I go forward in life.
5,Great material!,"I'll try not to repeat the many excellent reviews already done on this book. Our care Pastor uses this for education and fortunately practices the material both during his instruction and outside the classroom. I previously had taken a Stephen Ministries course which included one chapter out of 25 on boundaries. This book is much more thorough and covered much more material. While I did appreciate the authors use of scripture in the book, I found I was able to skip over much because of my background. However, it would definitely be an advantage to readers that did not have a strong Biblical education.Boundaries are not a huge issue in my life but I have come to realize that for many people, of all ages, they are a major relationship stumbling block. And even though I didn't attend the training for personal ""repair"", I was able to help friends, family and my wife and myself through some issues successfully using this material.I strongly endorse this book."
5,WOW,"When I first heard Henry Cloud speak I was not sure that I liked him. I know now know it was the truth that I was not ready to hear. This teaching CD/book is a mature Christians look at what we need to change and why we need to change it. I had so many Eureka moments from this teaching that I think I may need to listen to it over and over. It is hard to hear at times, you must be willing to want to change. I believe if we are willing to make the changes we need to make in our lives, then the sanctification process that God does in us can be done more quickly and effectively. I say mature Christian only because it was hard to hear where we fall short in life and if you hope to get the most out of it... maturity is essential."
2,Not the same as picture,"I thought I was ordering the latest version of this book, but I received a previous edition. I plan to teach a class using the latest version, so I will need to purchase another copy."
5,An eye opening and life changing book!,"A 19th century author named John Ruskin once wrote, ""Life being short, and the quiet hours of it few, we ought to waste none of them in reading valueless books."" I take that to heart, and I must say that BOUNDARIES is one of the most valuable books I have ever read, and the time I invested in reading this book and in working the workbook, has been some of the wisest time I have ever spent. I will reap dividends for the rest of my life. The video series by the same title is WELL worth the time also!"
3,"A little more help, a little less church","This book was recommended by a friend. It does have a lot of good information in it, but I found it hard to get past the preaching. If you are not a ""churchy"" person, it can really put you off.I'd love to see a version of this book that concentrated on the psychology and correcting the problem, and not on religion."
4,Practical advice and easy to put into practice,"I am not a deeply religious person but I previously had major, major issues with my own personal boundaries. I happened to hear about this book and can definitely say that it helped me. I skimmed over the overly religious parts and took the good practical advice to heart."
3,"Highly informative, yet repetitive.",This is a self-help book recommended by a national radio host. It has come to help define and truly understand our metaphorical 'boundaries' that are placed on our social life. This book is a great guide to understand the human condition as stated by the Bible.The only draw-back: It's highly repetitive.
3,Good Content Immersed in a Christian Teaching Book,"The basic points presented by ""Boundaries: When to Say YES, When to Say No, To Take Control of Your Life, are excellent and comprehensive. For my Non-Christian background, I found that at least two thirds of the book needed to be skipped over as irrelevant religious bible teaching, something that I cannot recommend in a neutral way to my psychotherapy clients."
4,Very good...,'Boundaries' is such an important and one of a kind christian masterpiece. Codependency presented from a christian perspective with lots of grounded scripture.
3,Now for the dilemma of responsibility!,"When to say yes and when to say no - a fundamental christian dilemma. We are always told to turn the other cheek - but some injustice isn't that easy to call. I find this book constructive in my life, but suspect I am giving something away in terms of personal responsibility. This book does tend to become the 'authority' on the book shelf and all too easy to fall back on. A book I find very empowering without giving specific advice, as this book does, is the inspiring ""THE Autobiography of Jesus.."" by Richard Patton. Althouh I refer often to this clear 'how to' book, I do feel slightly guilty that I didn't come to my own inner understanding of the problem - as is suggested by Patton. Perhaps a varied diet is the best! The Doctors have produced a very needed book and long may they reign."
4,GOOD READ!,"Boundries is an easy read and a subliminal self help book. While you are reading, you are being helped to understand your character and how best to change your ways of thinking. Diffently reccomended, especialy for us co dependant and those of us who can't say no."
2,Too religious,This book really focuses on the dilemma of being a christian and having good boundaries which is fine if that is the cause for your dilemma. There are many other causes of boundary issues that this book does not address or help you resolve.
5,Extraordinary!,"The principles in Boundaries have revolutionalized my life. Well worth the time and money. It's way beyond ""a good read""; it's extremely practical. I wish I'd read it years ago. I WILL be reading it at least once a year from now until I die. It's THAT good."
5,Great book!.,A great book but one I should have read a long time ago in my younger years because it would have helped me with the decision I made in life.
4,Eye-opener,"Boundaries awakens a Type A person's perspective on life. When we try to be all things to all people, we are nothing to ourselves. This book guides the reader through valuable inner reflection to identify the sources of life's chaos. You then learn to change your thinking and behavior to instill control into your personal and professional lives."
5,This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.,The analogy of our lives/bodies as personal property that God has given us to be good stewards over is exceptional. I have used it with several clients and have found it very effective. This book is great for anyone who wants to do some introspection and figure out if they are serving God or man.
5,Very Well Done,"The authors do a great job of simplifying complex relationship issues. I have recommended it to two clients and one has gained a great deal of self-awareness from it. The book superbly connects psychological principles with Christian scripture. I am not particularly attracted to this style but those who read scripture will get that added bonus. In any case, the book stands on it's psychological merits. At times the book seems to repeat itself but that's a matter of individual tastes and needs."
5,Boundaries Book,"This is a really good book for understanding different ways that you are not setting the right boundaries in your life. There are many examples of real life situations to identify with and ways they began to change the way the looked at their situations and how things changed. It has been a real help for me to examine my own life. I read it with a highlighter and pen in hand so I could make notes as I went and I could look back at the things I found especially useful. I have re-read it and find it very helpful. The only thing that I think is missing is a few more ways to really implement the changes they suggest - or more directed ways or suggestions. You can figure it out, but I would like some real direct suggestions. All in all a really good book that gets you thinking and changing while retaining a Christian perspective."
2,boundaries,good information. too much bible talk. wish they would stick to the boundaries message and not refer to the passage and verse of the bible..perhaps give bible reference at the end of each cd.
1,What About Grace and the Holy Spirit?,"This is psychology over Biblical substance. Poor theology and Scriptural interpretation abound. A topical book - study often takes some ""bird walks"" on context, but Dr's. Cloud and Townsend stray far off the course here. This book is absent of any teaching on Grace, empowerment of the Holy Spirit, and I'll agree with another reviewer, it is heresy in it's evaluation of Jesus' example. Using the Bible as a justification to ""hurt"" but not ""harm"" friends or family doesn't really sound like any part of the Beatitudes - because it's not! This is a psychology book, not a Bible study book. Read ""Grace Awakening"" by Chuck Swindoll or ""Why Grace Changes Everything"" by Chuck Smith for a better look at God's real power for daily living."
2,Can't find the message through the Biblical Quotes,"This book is a terrible disappointment to me. The very valuable messages within it are obfusticated with Biblical quotes and references in almost every line. Sometimes it does not even say what the Bible says- just gives a Book, chapter & verse, making it necessary to flip back and forth from your bible to this book in order to understand it. It is very difficult to understand what it is saying because the Bible verses get in the way. It seems to be written for someone who needs ammunition to fire back at a Bible thunper who is overstepping your personal boundaries.The content of the book would be wonderful if is were untangled from the Biblical references. After reading a chapter, I feel as though I have been fending off a religious prosetylizer at my doorstep- and that person would also have been overstepping my boundaries!"
1,Total Farce,"When I ordered this book I was led to believe it was based on the science of mental health. What I found was that it was a book on Christian values, Bible verses, and virtual preaching. Instead of sound psychological protocol I was given Bible classes. I am not anti-Christian, or anti-religion, but I don't expect to buy a book on psychology only to find it is about two men's religious values. I returned this book."
1,For Christians only,"As someone who is not a Christian I found this book to be basically incomprehensible. All of the concepts are couched in biblical quotes or Christian theology, and as a non-believer I could not glean from it general principles that would seem to apply to me. Without a thorough grounding in the Bible I think that this book just doesn't make sense. I would not recommend this book to a broad population, as it assumes that one's motivation for modifying behavior is based on the teachings of Christianity and interpretations of the Bible. I quite frankly didn't *understand* most of it and could not untangle many useful concepts from in between the numerous Bible quotes. I would not classify this as a work of psychology or a self-help book outside of a Christian context."
4,"Boundaries, by Cloud and Townsend","The book gives an in-depth review of how people get so ""off-track"" with their lives, and emphasizes that most people need professional, or a support team, to lift them back to productive lives.I like the thought that ""will power"" attempts to place our will above God's power.Thank you Cloud and Townsend."
5,Learned a lot from this book,I think everyone should read this book.It would make life easier for many if they knew how to set and keep bandries in each of thier relationships.
5,Great book!,This is an awesome book! I learned so much about myself and why I have a tendency to end up in bad relationships. I am going to make positive changes in my life thanks to this book! I highly recommend it!
2,Fair to Midland,Lots of recognizable selections just not very well done. The accordion is ok have heard much better. The guitar sounds like a student of 1 year. Can't really recommend this cd for the money they want.
2,Go to sleep...,"This is musak for accordion. It'll put you to sleep if you're not careful. The disc arrived with a sticker on the front that said ""Made in Japan"". Maybe that explains the weird name ""Frencher Style"". Not much English on the liner notes, and the artist(s) names aren't even given. Contains all the cliche songs (April in Paris, La Vie en Rose, La Marseillaise, Un Homme et Une Femme) done in an extremely cliche style. Boring! Not a whiff of improv, which is what makes truly great accordion music rock. There is a lot of accordion music out there that's so much better than this."
5,Crash Dive,Crash Dive is a great book. It is a good book for people and kids who like submarines. I liked it quite a bit. It is the kind of book that I would like to read. It is not too long but not too short. It really isn't just about one person; it is about a whole crew of people.It is about a sub(U 1x) that is a lot better than other subs. It is better because it is a lot quieter. This sub is going to attack Portsmouth. When they get there they have to get by a lot of traps. When the Americans finally find out that it is there it might be too late. I really advise you to read this book because it is great.
3,Disappointing DVD,"I found this DVD to be a disappointment. Where I was looking for step-by-step instructions geared to a player who wants to review basics as well as learn some tips from a pro, entirely too much time is spent in this DVD trying to convince the viewer how great Ben Hogan was. There are several interviews with other pros telling you how great he was, how he was always impeccably dressed, etc., etc. You might not hear his entire life story but hordes of time are wasted on non-instructional material. Don't get me wrong; there is solid instruction in this DVD. You just have to be liberal in using the FF button on your DVD player to get at it without falling asleep. After purchasing this disappointing DVD, I just bit the bullet and hired a golf pro for lessons."
2,Shoes slip off!,"I was disappointed to find that this rack is so tilted that the shoes don't want to stay on it; they slip off. If you can find something to put on the rack to make the shoes stay, then it does look much better than having all the shoes on the floor."
1,Disappointment,"After searching for this book in bookstores and libraries, I finally found it on Amazon. I'm truly sorry I spent so much time looking for this book. I found it dull and uninteresting. I've traveled to several spots in the Bahamas and Caribbean and thought this would weave a tale of intrigue and island mystery. Sadly, it did not. Since I never leave a book unfinished, I trudged through it until the end, which was the best part of the experience."
2,Beware Before You Buy,"I was very disappointed in this doll. Nowhere on the box does it say that you need to buy hair extensions for the doll. Yes, it does come with 2 in the box. One, I put in wrong, and then, you can't put it in again. Then my daughter gave her 2 hair cuts with the other extension, and now we are done. No more hair extensions - meaning Barbie cannot get any more haircuts until I go to the store and buy more. Barbie's real hair has to be hidden under the hair smock so you don't cut her real hair. You have to cut the extensions. So after 15 minutes of fun and a few haircuts, you can't use the toy again, until you get more extensions. Please beware before you buy. I did not know this when I bought the product."
2,Disapointed,I bought this Barbie for my niece's Easter present. I put the first extension in wrong and there went the fun. She calls me about once a week to ask me to buy her more hair. I can't find it anywhere! Don't think about calling Mattel to order it either. They send you back to the store. I wish I had gone with the SpongeBob Barbie instead....
2,Don't waste your money,Waste of money. Can't do any hair styles with them except cut. Hard to manage and a waste of money. I was stupid enough to buy 2 of these for xmas presents.
1,Most disappointing Barbie,"The box and ads are completely misleading for this Barbie. It doesn't say anywhere on the box that you need to buy refills for the hair extensions. Also, the hair gets all tangled up in Barbie's back which makes it difficult to pull out of her head without opening her back up again and straightening it out. This was a good way to show my daughter how commercials exaggerate how good products are."

4,"A worthwhile, understandable reference",I have a masters degree in Reformed Theological Studies and use this book regularly when teaching adult Sunday school classes.
5,Great reference book,This is a good theological reference book. I recommend it to all students who study theology.
4,"Encyclopedic, Yet Concise",The articles in this volume have been written by some of the most thoughtful evangelicals. They are scholarly and to the point. Buy this volume and savor it.
5,Great Book!,"I needed this book for my class and after reading it, I know it will be a major part of my library and life! This book is a must have, thanks Amazon for making it available at a much lower price than the school was selling it for!"
4,"A great work, but sometimes biased.","No doubt this is a great volume and is an essential reference work for evangelical theology. The dictionary provides a good overview of the evangelical position on many contemporary issues in theology.I am periodically disappointed, though, at the biased perspective of some of the articles. For example, the one on ""election"" simply assumes a Calvinist position (though many ""evangelicals"" are Arminians, and many Arminians even contribute to the dictionary). In this regard, Van Harvey's classic ""A Handbook of Theological Terms"" is superior in its unbiased treatment of terms."
2,Ruby Payne's first book is better,This book is too simplistic and not as informative as Ms. Payne's 1990's amazing book entitled A Framework for Understanding Poverty which was directed toward educators. There isn't much additional helpful material here except for slanting the information toward middle class church member awareness of the generational poverty mindset in the U.S.
5,Great book about 2 Englishman's bike trip across India,"This is a great book. I read it before my first trip to India in 1991. Since it is written as an account of their trip from Kashmir to the Southern coast of India by bicycle, it is more enjoyable than reading an India guidebook, but gives you most of the information you need as a western traveler to India. Since they traveled by bicycle, they tell you a lot about the villages, countryside, and people of India, much more than a lot of books which focus on the cities. Truly enjoyable"
5,a thought provoking look at the US,"Dr. Thompson is spot on, and our country has been an imperial power for decades. We have, again and again, ignored the advice of George Washington and involved ourselves in other nation's affairs. We are, no matter what we want to admit, the new global power. despite Bush's attempts,and must behave accordingly. Dr. Thompson, pHd. Michigan, has provided a thoughtful look at our imperial heritage and a look at where, as a nation, we are headed."
5,Two Thumbs WAAAY up for Miss Lenhard!! *G*,"This one of the best Charmed books ever written. I loved the combination of Greek Mythology and Charmed. Unlike the 'Oh My Goddess' episodes, this book blends both genres together effortlessly. The writing is top-notch... it really pulls you into what's going on. I had a hard time putting this book down (finished it in a couple days.. even with work).HIGHLY recommend this to Charmed fans. You won't be disappointed :)."
5,Greek Myths+ Life,"i have read all the books in the charmed series and this is one of my favorites. it combines the greek mythologies with modern day life, which i think is quite creative. i highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys greek myths."
5,i love this book!!!!,this is one of my favourite charmed books!!! as it shows true halliwell spirit. basically prue gets the oppertunaty for a front page photo. but the camera she uses sends all the models and pheobe into hades. in the effort to get there sister back piper and prue have to go through loads of greek mythology gods and creatures. this book is a must have for all charmed fans
4,A Good Book But...,"I purchased this book for my son, who is in the restaurant business and wants to become very knowledgable of wine. I'm sure this book would do the trick. It's a Dorling Kindersley book and so is beautifully presented, and is an impressive tome (it's big). However both the original copy that I ordered, and the replacement copy, were defective in the same way. In the original copy the back cover was separated from the text, and in the replacement copy both covers were separated. The Amazon rep said she would alert Amazon to the possibility that the whole ""batch"" may be damaged. The fifth star is missing because of the defect in the binding."
5,great for the serious wine student,Great for studying for Sommelier exam and also great for wine buyers to learn about vineyards...and much more.
1,"Terrible, awful horrible movie","Bad acting, writing and cinematography. I'm a big fan of cheesy horror movies but this is a complete waste. I didn't watch more than 15 minutes of it because it was so irritating."
3,Another So-So Blair Witch,"Although slightly entertaining, the movie is average to below average at best. However, what do you expect. The world of bigfoot movies has always been an odd lot at best. There has been worse, but there has definitely been better. Actors actually do the best they can for such an ultra low budget production."
5,The Very Best of Bobby Vee,SONGS WERE GREAT AND UPBEAT. I WILL PROBABLY BUY ANOTHER ONE OF HIS CD'S. IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE CD'S BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THE ITEMS.
5,Impressive in scope,"This compilation of hits by Bobby Vee is eye-opening in that it indicates how surprisingly wide and impressive was his impact on songs in the 50s and early 60s. Very impressive in scope and enjoyable to listen to. A satisfying collection from a talented musician, somewhat in the style of Ricky Nelson. A ""must"" for a 50s oldies collections, in my opinion."
2,Too many missing tunes,"Missing tunes like ""I'll Make You Mine"" and ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" make this a poor choice for the title ""Very Best...""There is a better greatest hits package out there. Some filler was added to this as well."
5,A Fun Way to Go Back in Time,This is a great example of the works of Bobby Vee - I had forgotten about him until I happened upon him about a year ago. I have seen him in concert many times and this CD covers the gamut of his talent - why hasn't he been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - a mistery to me! This CD will make you dance around the house or make your commute seem much shorter (this is always on of the 12 CDs in my car). Don't hesitate - order this CD today AND if you have a chance to see Bobby Vee and the Veelines in concert RUN don't walk - you'll have a blast!
5,Great toy,I bought this toy for my 5 year old neice a few months ago and she loves it. She plays with it all the time and it is still in one peice. That is nothing short of amazing because she is very rough on all of her toys.
1,do not buy it!!!!,"Less than 2 years ago, I bought 3 of these: for my friend with a disability, for my cleaning lady and for myself. Within a year, all three failed to function and my requests for help with repairs were denied. Do yourself a favor -do not waste money on this product."
1,Safety Issue,I purchased four of these EMERGENCY lights for my shop and office. Slightly over a year later we had a power outage and none of the units worked. Customer support was non responsive. DO NOT trust this product with your safety or security. Sorry I had to give it a 1.
4,I love these jeans!,I love these jeans! They have just enough give to hug your body right.I only bought 2 pair and i wish i would have gotten five. These are the only jeans that i want in my collection and i am a denim freak! I give 7seven jeans a big thumbs way up.
1,FAKE 7 Jeans,I wish I would have known these jeans were fake!!!!!!!!! The company was very deceptive. They should let customers know that their products are not authentic!!!!
2,Addendum book only,"Totally my fault, but I thought I was buying the larger book, not the tiny additional book. Wish I had read the description better."
5,Amazon Verified Purchase,This is a simple yet powerful book which I will use as a reference guide for quite some time. It has a table of content which allows me to easily find what I am looking for. I like the area provided for notes. It is a timeless classic. I highly recommend this book.
2,The Quick prayer not the devotional guide,"I had the original book some years ago but recently gave it to my sister. When I ordered what I thought was my 'replacement' copy what I got was this small pocket book that doesn't quite do it. This is NOT the Full devotional book with scriptural guidance introductions to each prayer topic. It really IS merely a small, pocket book with the prayers--useful for the parent who wants a quick prayer, but not useful for the one who wants a deeper dive into the God-thinking that can build those prayers. The cover looks the same but the one I bought years ago even has introductory statements from her children which are so edifying. And the introductory few pages to each prayer were filled with scripture and personal anecdotes I found so useful. It also had a contents page with the areas of prayer arranged in useful themes. I really wish I could have that version again but can't seem to find it."
3,It's ok,"I ordered this book (2 copies) as baby shower gifts for friends. It's VERY small. I have the full-sized version of this book and it's awesome. I thought I was ordering the paperback version of the one I have. Not so. It's condensed and fits in the palm of your hand. I suppose it's good for having at your bedside or putting in your purse to have with you at all times. But next time, guess I should read the description better to check the dimensions before I buy!"
3,A bit disappointed,"Having heard many very favorable reviews of this book, its small size was a significant disappointment. The content however appears to be quite sound and after I use it a while I may conclude that this little pocket size book is really a tiny treasure. Verdict open....."
4,"Open en dark ECM records, with minor production flaws","If you're waiting for a record to showcase Gary Peacock's technical skills as a bass player, this is not the one to get. His playing is very modest, and almost confined to the background, with the exception of the solo piece that opens the album. Apart from that, it features the typical open, spacy sound of ECM records, with airy solos by Jan Garbarek on sax and Palle Mikkleborg on trumpet. With the dark bass lines of Peacock's, this is an interesting listen. The only remark is that the production is a bit disturbing every now and then, mostly when it comes to trumpet and drums."
1,Stick it in the pile with your old internet CDs...,"...because that's just about what it's worth.I don't think I've ever seen a *duller* vampire picture in my life. The acting was so stilted that the lead vampire wasn't so much undead as just dead boring, most of the rest of the characters looked as if they were reading their lines from cue cards, and the best I can say for the gore was that I wanted to ask the vamps to brush their fangs after eating.This was just the first third of the movie. I stopped watching after that--I didn't even bother keeping it on for background noise.But, hey, at least the case can be reused."
1,absolutely worthless,"Picked up and watched two movies last night, Blade of the Vampire, and David DeCoteau's The Frightening. Any one familiar with David DeCoteau's movies knows how hilariously lame they are. Well, Blade of the Vampire makes The Frightening look like it should be up for an academy award, no joke! Believe EVERY word the other reviewers here have written, because it's all true. I usually don't gripe about the money spent on a B movie bought out of the bargain bin, but this one wasn't even worth a dime! You've been warned."
3,Nothing New In This Anthology,"I first fell under the spell of David Lanz's new age piano stylings when I purchased 1996's SACRED ROADS. At that time Lanz had already been recording for more than a decade. In 2002 I picked up the 2-disc anthology ROMANTIC: THE ULTIMATE DAVID LANZ NARADA COLLECTION. At 27 tracks and two hours of music, it was a nearly flawless compilation. Three years later Narada lifts ten tracks from that album and calls it BEST OF. The music is, of course, excellent; but it's nowhere near as complete--or satisfying--as ROMANTIC. Not only is the 2-disc collection a better buy, it makes BEST OF unnecessary."
3,Its ok,"I wasnt crazy about the whole CD. Maybe to someone else it will be more stars. Its nice, but not the best I heard.."
3,Love Lanz,"David Lanz is outstanding. What happens with ""Best of"" is that it sometimes lacks consistency of mood. This album does not represent the flow David creates in his full length albums. Not bad tho'."
2,TYPOS GALORE (This Publisher Needs An Proofreader),"I purchased this book for a course in American Literature. There aren't many printed version of this text, so my professor has to make due with what is available. However, NORILANA BOOKS ought to be too ashamed to call themselves a publisher. Sometimes, independent companies shouldn't do what the big boys do. This book has too many typos and the chapters are incorrectly numbered. For example, when I finished reading chapter 22, the next chapter was 13.Now onto the book: I'd rate it 4 STARS. The story is very interesting and draws the reader in from the beginning, because McCutcheon's is a good writer. I would recommend this story to anyone looking to read something outside their normal realm. I just would highly recommend they download the free Google Books version. Or see if there is another version offered on Amazon. But, DO NOT under any circumstances buy this book from this craptastic publisher."
4,Really holds children's attention!,"I read this book to my pre-K class of 4 and 5-year-old children. They really liked it! It held their attention and they understood it because of all the practical examples of good deeds that the words and illustrations showed. The short paragraphs and rhyming words made the book go along fast, and it led to good discussions of what the different ""fruits of the spirit"" meant."
4,Fun and simple to teach the message,A friend recommended this book to help remind kids or situations and how they should react in the Christ like fashion. It has been a great learning tool for my younger two children. Very simplistic at times but the kids and I do enjoy it.
2,Disappointing because it could have been so good,"Mr. Hilderman uses family relics and actual letters written by soldiers to give a good view of the period, but his allegation that the Confederate army only carried on the war in the end because of forced servitude is ludicrous. The swell of patriotism carried men into the ranks, and love for their families and homes kept them there. While some letters and diaries of the period do express the ""rich man's war, poor man's fight"" sentiment, far more continued to risk their lives out of the southern-born-and-bred sense of duty to their states and families. Hilderman does these brave veterans, as well as their descendents, a disservice by stating that they fought only because they were forced into it. Two stars."
1,They Went into the Fight Cheering,"Mr. Hilderman's book is simply a ""sour grapes"" attempt to cast wildly inaccurate aspersions, (and passing them off as history), on the courage and commitment of the Southern soldier because of his own personal excommunication from the Southern history and heritage community. This book is not worth the time it takes to read it, and the best possible use for it would be to hang it on a nail in the outhouse and let nature take it's course. It is South bashing at it's absolute worst.....from a man with a HUGE axe to grind. I give it a negative 5 stars."
4,Unique perspective on war,"I found this book to be a unique view of the Southern Infantry not normally explored in many others books describing this time period. The author presents a perhaps unpopular view but very truthful statement that many were not eager to leave hearth and home unprotected and without food in order to defend someone else's hearth and home. I found the book to be very enjoyable. However, the prospective reader should realize this is a non-fiction that contains numerous sections of legislations which no writer can make interesting if one lacks the aptitude for careful study of legal documents. I particularly enjoyed the description of Mallet's unit in Kinston.[...]"
4,The best I've had,"Pros:- large mousing surface, I don't ""run out"" even on a 2560px wide desktop- gel pad has just the right height for me- the precision surface can be removed and the underlying pad be used- very little friction when moving wrist across the padCons:- precision mouse surface is a bit noisy, although the base pad is not- precision mouse surface has post-it type glue- chemical smell from close range"
4,Mouse pad with wrist rest works as advertised,"Good wrist support, nice design. Crumbs from lunches at my desk, though, like to get caught in its grooves!"
2,Nice Product But Didnt Last,"Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear, and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface.I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent $15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them."
3,Surface Area,"The surface composition and wrist pad on the 3M Precise Mousing Surface are right on but the surface area that the mouse has to travel on is much too small. I find myself having to reposition the mouse all the time. To be fair I did buy a new computer and monitor when I purchased this mouse pad. I went from a 17"" to a 22"" monitor. I don't know if this makes a difference in how the mouse travels on the pad."
4,Easy on the wrist,"This not so simple mouse pad may be just what the doctor ordered. I like the surface for both mechanical and optical mice. The gel pad is quite comfortable. The size and shape of the mousing surface means I rarely seem to run out of room or have to pick up my mouse and move it in order to continue (and I have dual monitors!)One drawback is that the surface is not smooth, but very slightly ribbed, like the old LP albums before CDs came along. A little dirt can can collect on the surface of the pad and it can be difficult to remove. Despite the above shortcoming, I would not hesitate to get another. In fact, I have two, one at home and one at work."
3,Daniel Green Slippers,These are nice looking if you like snakeskin. It was the only choice in my size so that's what I got. These slippers fit more like shoes than slippers but they are comfortable. I don't like the look of them - they remind me of my grandfather's slippers because they fan out a little on the sides and just look odd. Altogether though they are a good slipper.
1,Arghhh...,"Mr. Jarrett should be banned as a Bach interpreter.I could give this one two stars and reserve the ""one star"" for book II, which he plays on harpsichord, but even on the piano he performs dismally."
4,Dance n' Flex Barbie Review,"This Barbie is really fun to play with.It's so unusual how her whole body is that soft rubbery material!But what suprised me is that her behind and chest are the flexy material too!This toy well, I wouldent call it educational,unless your trying to learn how to do the human pretszal!But you'll have hours of fun with it!I think they should have made her fingers seperated with wire in them so she could hold stuff.And her skin does need a scrub down after playing because of the black marks from the rubber.All in all its great I reccomend it ecspecally for a b-day or holiday!"
5,Photo album,This is a very unique photo album. I am using it as an alternative to a traditional photo album. It showcases the pictures very nicely and is exactly what I was looking for.
3,Xenosaga,The Xenosaga Strategy Guide came with an outer protective cover (which was nice as it keeps the book from getting destroyed) and a sound track; although the sound track was not something I personally cared for. The book was well-written; it gives you the information needed to get through the game. I gave it three stars because it is just the typical strategy guide.
1,Worst video series EVER!!!,"I recently previewed the Industrial Revolution video in hopes of showing it to my students. When I started the video, I realized it was produced by the ""Just the Facts"" people, and that we had several videos from this series in our school library already.Without exception, these videos are dry, dull, and of questionable production value. If I showed this to my students, they would either fall asleep, hate me, or both. I will never, ever purchase another title from this series again. It is truly awful."
3,a good alternative option for yoga music,Some of them sound pretty energetic and vivid. My favorite one is the last 2 songs. Very soothing.
2,Not appropriate for yoga a class,"I will only be using the first and last songs from this CD in my yoga class. The rest of the songs are not appropriate for the kind of mood I like to create. A couple of the songs are jazz/blues, another one is really boring and repetitive, and the rest are just not interesting. If this CD lacked the first and last songs I would be completely disappointed and rate it one star."
5,Takes your Shiva bliss off the mat,"Love it. As a big fan of the Yoga Shakti DVD practice, this is the perfect way for me to connect with those blissful moments off the mat. I like to play it while doing household chores and sometimes bust into an impromptu Yoga Trance Dance. Helps to garner the life force and prana Shakti whenever we can get it!"
2,Navy Monopoly Monopolizes the Navy,"This game is not what I expected at all. I was looking for the US Navy monoply ""Battleship Edition"" instead I got a cheap verson of the Navy. It sucked! I am searching the web to find the Battleship Edition. I know it does exist. I saw it about 10 years ago at the exchange, but did not have any money at the time. Now I am determined to fine the edition I am looking for!!!"
4,"Cute, but not leather..","I bought these for my pre-school son, they look nice and are reinforced in the tip, but are not made from leather. I've used others from this brand and they were excellent!! let's wait to see if these are too."
5,Best first shoe,"First 'real' shoe for granddaughter. Was wonderful. Shaped right for baby foot, easy to put on and take off. Very sturdy and stayed looking good through a lot of use."
2,solid shoe but my son did not like them,these are solid shoes as expected from Stride Rite. However they are not very flexible and my toddler had trouble walking in them and ended up NOT walking when these we on him. When I would put his other Stride Rites on with the Natural Motion System he walked much better. I would not buy again for a beginning walker.
4,Well worth the money,"These are comfortable, provide good optics and inexpensive. I'd buy another pair. These are as good as most Luxottica brands without price premium."
5,Where's the Information?,I would like for Amazon to please provide the Information for this CD. I'm intersted in buying it but I won't unless I know that it's a new CD. What if it's Miami'05? I'm not going to buy a CD that I already have. If someone has any info please email me. JVCG145@yahoo.comThank you.
2,Runs Fast,"It's a very beautiful watch, and I remember how nice my Seiko watch was I got as a high school graduation gift. Ran for years, never needed winding, never need batteries, just worked great. This one probably will do the same, but since it's 3 minutes fast every day, I'll probably get something else. I guess Seiko isn't the watch it used to be."
5,HorseFACTOR = 10/10,Johnny Borrell is very talented. This DVD is worth it! Johnny really loves his crowd. He runs around shirtless and his performances are very intense! This DVD contains not only an excellent gig but also 7 music videos and 3 rare and wonderful exclusives!
1,Beware return policies,"I ordered the AFW-4300 from Amazon, when installed the PCI Card it was not recognized by the computer. After several days trying to find out the problem I ordered another FireWire card by a different manufacturer. It worked fine. I then started trying to return what I consider a defective product. Amazon and Adaptec refused to accepted it, and advised that I get a RTM from the seller. The only problem is the condition in which they want the product returned. It must be in the original container complete with all of the appropriate stickers. When I tried to remove the PCI Card from the plastic container I had to cut it to pieces, therefore I cannot meet their standards for a return. I therefore will write it off to experience and be more careful where I buy in the future."
5,Highly recommended paring knife,"I got this knife because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated. It has been a fantastic paring knife. It has really good heft and balance. It feels really good in the hand. It is easy to handle when cutting up food. The blade is sharp and I have not had any issues or struggles with this knife. Because I keep good care of it and keep it sharp, I have not ever cut myself with this knife and neither has anyone using it in my house. A bad dull knife is a lot more dangerous to use in the kitchen, this one makes for safer cooking. The price is not cheap, but you only need a few knives in the kitchen and a paring knife is a must. With good care this knife will last you forever and is well worth the money. I highly recommend this knife to all my friends and anyone looking to get some nice knifes."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"More of the story of Miss Misery is revealed in the third volume of Sleeper. Holden of course can't help himself, and definitely shags her when possible, and is probably developing feelings for her. Her thing is that she needs to cause pain and suffering in others for her to stay alive, and to charge up her superhuman abilities. This makes it a tad hard to form normal attachments and relationships."
2,eh...,"I had already started learning the language before I got this, do not make the same mistake. If you are just starting to learn, this might help you... I guess it's kind of obvious now that I think about it."
4,Touching,"As a writer, and especially a female writer I was moved by every piece in Through It All. They are each a snapshot of life that all can identify with. I've seen J. Simone perform and you cannot help but feel each line and view reality through her eyes. Good Job, keep up the good work."
3,Not Helpful,"This guide is very good in finding the trophies, gems, and crystals. But, it has NO help on how to get Gold Relics or Platinum Relics. And the Relics are the hardest to achive."
5,very useful,I am an English major and had never seen the majority of the words listed in here! Since I am always looking to learn interesting new words this was a real find. It is an excellent tool while preparing for the verbal section of the GRE and learning more colorful terms in general.
3,Be carful IT IS A DICTIONARY,IT IS A DICTIONARY !!!! NOT A VOCABULARY BOOKIT ONLY HELP ME TO GET A SPECIFIC WORD MEAN
2,Popular with some - not me,"All natural beef, but too soft for my taste - doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like. This is a matter of personal taste - the product is good, just not for everyone.I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold-smoked beef-sticks. Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.This company has superb customer service!"
2,Not What I expected,"Soft. Mushy. Moist.These are the tree words that best describe these sticks. I was definitely expecting these sticks to be dryer and chewier.The flavor is pretty good . . . but the texture makes these a ""thumbs-down"" for me."
2,Did I buy dog treats?,Or just fake tasting beef sticks?Either way they were terrible.2nd star for edibility during times of extreme hunger/famish.
3,Mushy,"I expected these to have more snap and be less mushy than they were. The taste is probably a 4 out of 5 but the consistency falls way short. Almost feels like processed meat when you're chewing it up. This is a personal preference, others may enjoy this about the product."
2,"Good, Just not what I was looking for","I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess."
2,Dont like it,"Guess its just personal preference, but dont like them. Ended up giving them away and using them as dog treats."
4,Good Beef Sticks,"I enjoyed this product. They are a good value for the amount you get. I did not sense much honey in the product, so a bit more flavor would be nice. I would buy again."
4,Teriyaki Ole' Smokies Beef Sticks,"I bought the Buffalo Bills Teriyaki Ole' Smokies beef sticks because I absolutely LOVE beef sticks, especially teriyaki, and I thought this would be a good buy - good quantity for the price.The teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful. I also loved the texture, it was very soft and tender.The only bad thing I'd have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy, fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth, which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to FULLY enjoy the product. Aside from that, I may still order it again. :)"
3,"So, So. Better to get HOT Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Short Shots",Tried Mild Only.Amazon $28 on 02/12/2012ProGood weight price value.ConMushy (was hoping it would be drier & firmer like other reviews stated).No Snap to skin.So So Flavor.HOT Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Short Shots taste good & have better texture.Also better price/weight ratio. Smaller peices means better portion control.
5,Really Good!,"These have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef taste!Choo Choo R Snacks always has excellent customer service, and they throw in a few samples as well!"
5,Add-ons work,"looking at ways to improve camping and hunting efficiency, one must be ready to carry anything with you in the woods. Having these clips helps secure loads to you pack when you are out in the woods hunting your next meal. they are solid and dependable.get them!!!!!"
2,Somewhat disappointing.,"I was rather disappointed not just with the poor quality of this DVD, but because it didn't really meet my expectations. I enjoy these animated short festivals very much and was hoping to view these in high definition and have access to an interactive menu. I have the same compilation on video, but I wanted to see if there was a DVD format so I could replace it."
4,Good airplane or beach story,"I have not read this author before, and I really enjoyed this story. The characters were good, and the plot had enough twists to keep you guessing ""who done it."" I have recommended this to friends."
2,Too Predictable,"Ugh! I bought this on a Kindle deal. Never heard of the author before. Thought I'd give it a chance.Are you kidding me? This book is more written for teenagers. Seriously. Who would have a large group of friends together at the same time solving a supposedly a murder from 10 yrs ago in a same area. Give me a break. It's more like what you would see on LifeTime channel. The story is so sappy, I couldn't stand it. All the characters were way too self absorbed with their own lives. Ugh! I couldn't even finish the ending. Sorry, not my style. Too unrealistic!!"
4,Quick Entertaining Read,"I bought the kindle version of this book because it was on sale and was pleasantly surprised. The story was an enjoyable ""whodunit"" that was fast paced. At the same time, I was able to put it down and go back to it and not forget characters which is a huge plus when you have 2 young children. I am interested in reading more books from this author."
1,Tedious and annoying,"Annoying in the extreme. Why one 20-year old student is to be held responsible for another 20-year old is never really explained in a way that makes it realistic. A romantic suspense story where I wanted the heroine to reject her ""true love"" with extreme prejudice. The ""victim"" was completely unsympathetic. Couldn't wait to finish and delete this one from my Kindle."
2,Boring and frustrating to read.,"I didn't enjoy this book. I finished it because of the suspense, I just wanted to find out the murderer to end my frustration with the story. None of the characters are remarkable. I read it a couple of months ago and I can't even remember the plot. It is that easy to forget."
2,Suspenseful but tedious?,"I am currently listening to this on CD in my car as I commute to and from work so it has not been the ""fast read"" that others have experienced. Although I agree that the suspense is there, I find I can't wait to just get it over with and find out ""who dunnit?"" already! The dialogue is predictable and repetitive to the point of being boring and the love scenes are ridiculous. Maybe it's because I am listening to it rather than actually reading it myself. Maybe the voice actress is my problem with it. She performs the women's voices well but every time she speaks as one of the male characters I almost laugh out loud. I'd say, if you want to enjoy this book, don't make my mistake. Read the book, don't listen to it. This is my first experience with the author and it will be my last."
4,good read,"Good read. Holds your interest and provides a few twists that have you thinking you have the killer figured out, just to find that you are wrong!"
3,Great read!,I was surprised and please with this book! I will surely read other books by this author. This book keep my attention and made me want to know what was going to happen. It keepme reading and wanting to pick the book up when I was not busy.
4,Really good!,Very interesting read. Had a hard time putting it down once I started! Kept the mystery till the very end!
1,No Go!,"I did not like this book at all. The writing style was tedious and undramatic. The characters were not well-developed and shallow. I had read the first third of the book and almost put it down, but finished it quickly as scanning many pages did not leave me missing anything! I have heard Ms. Freethy is a good author, but that was not my experience."
4,It doesn't gave to be a great book to tell a good engaging story,"I enjoyed it and wanted to know how it ended. I can tell I'm ""into"" a book if I want to peek at the final pages (although I don't)!"
4,All she ever wanted.,One of those stories that keep you coming back as much as possible till the ending. Highly recommended. Well written love story with a great story line.
3,Apparently it's forgetable,"I knew I downloaded this book but couldn't remember what it was about. I read the synopsis again and thought, ""That sounds familiar"". Eventually it clicked and I remembered the story line. It was only in December (a month ago) that I bought this book. I don't remember hating it but I don't remember loving it either. It was a fine ""filler"" read until finding something with a bit more substance."
3,3.5 stars,"The real victims in death are those left behind. Long after a beautiful friend tragically dies and her friends have moved on, the three sorority sisters are haunted by the events that led to Emily's death. Now, Madison, Natalie, and Laura are being forced to recall their friend's fall to her death when a bestselling novel clearly is patterned after their lives and Emily's death. Plunging back into their memories brings up old hurts, renewed love, and danger. Yet, when the end comes, it has a twist that no one suspected, and could kill again.Demonstrating her versatility and talent, Ms. Freethy has created a story that will draw in many of her current fans and win new ones. With psychological complexity and chilling suspense, this can be said to be her best novel since Daniel's Gift."
4,Good mystery,"A good mix of mystery and romance. A nice relaxing read. This book kept me wondering as to ""who did it?""."
3,Maintains suspense right until the end,"An unknown novelist describes an event from the past that four sorority sisters from Santa Clara University. Each of the three surviving sisters has moved on to another chapter in their lives and would rather forget the events that led to the tragic death of golden girl, Emily.Her former roommate and best friend, Natalie bears the brunt of accusations, as the story takes both fact and fiction and concludes that she is a murderer. A chance meeting with her former flame, Cole (who also happens to be Emily's brother), has the two reluctantly joining forces to get to the bottom of the mystery and meet the elusive writer, which only opens even deeper wounds, and causes them to examine their still smoldering feelings for each other.Freethy does a great job of maintaining the suspense and tossing around several red herrings until the actual circumstances of Emily's death are revealed."
4,Fast and easy read,This was my first book by the author and I couldn't put it down. I didn't figure out the killer until the author revealed him/her to the reader. I will read more by this author.
2,Not worth my time,"The book was light and I finished it, but the writing was remedial and just felt like a bad soap opera. Everything was just over-the-top and it was easy to see where the book was going. A bit too predictable."
4,Solid,I enjoyed this book and the twist at the end. I would recommend this book to a friend. The story captured my attention and I was able to read it pretty fast.
1,Don't waste your money,"I do day care and was so excited to find a coat tree that would be low enough for the kids to hang their coats, cute looking, had more than 4 pegs and was a decent price. I read all the reviews when I ordered it but thought I would give it a try anyways. Not only did 2 of the pegs fall out as I was putting it together, 3 more have fallen out since then. I wish I had returned it the first day. I thought using some strong glue would hold them in but no. I've had it for a month and a half and it's going in the trash tomorrow. I could build a better one myself!"
3,OK for little kids,"Very easy to assemble, so easy my 7 year old did it! One of the hangers was broken upon arrival but managed to fix it in place with glue!Not made for heavy coats but OK for little children to hang their coats and hats.."
1,Not functional,"I sent this coat rack back twice. The first time 2 of the center poles did not screw together. The 2nd and 3rd ones I received did not have pegs that screwed completely into the center. The ones that did were flimsy. I would not recommend buying this product, it is not good quality."
1,"Looks great, functions horribly",This product looks great but is a piece of junk. Pegs aren't strong and fall off easily. Had to return it.
4,Kid's Primary Color 8 Pet Coat Rack,"Not real impressed, some of the pegs did not tighten up , they just kept spinning when you had to twist them in the post. So we had to glue them in."
1,poor,"I rate this product at a poor scale; the rack knobs would not all screw into the receiving end. I had to glue them in, and they still came off. Not a good product."
1,The crappiest piece of furniture I've ever bought!,"Seriously, the thing fell apart when I was assembling it. Terrible quality even for such a cheap value. I strongly recommend spending a little more money and getting something that will not put your kids in danger."
1,Coat rack is poorly made.,"This coat rack is poorly made. When you try to screw the pegs in, the metal receptacles come out of the post."
1,Disappointed,"This is junk.Some of the pegs could not be screwed in to the post.So, they were not tight enough to hold a coat.One peg has already cracked.Not worth the effort of sending back.Save your money. You get what you pay for"
1,Poor Quality,"Very disappointed with this product. It is cheaply made. To begin with, 2 of the pegs came stripped-would not grip at all when trying to tighten when putting it together. Within the 1st week, 3 of the pegs came lose/fell-broke off. My husband had to buy all new larger inserts & use wood glue to fix it. I purchased this for my daycare kids to hang their coats on. My daycare kids (ages 2-4)were NOT rough at all on this at all. I even helped them put their coats on the pegs to insure they were hooked on right or it wouldn't fall over on them. Base of this item is very poor also--not solid at all--tips over VERY easily. This is a Kid's Coat Rack for goodness sake. They are not going to know they need to ""balance"" their coats evenly on it other wise it will fall over on them. All they are looking at as a kid is which color peg they want...lol. VERY DISAPPOINTED in product!!! Would NOT recommend to anyone!!!"
1,Rubbish,"I expected this to be cheap, but was thinking Ikea cheap, not completely useless. Internal screws were missing, those that were there we loose so when the pegs were screwed into the post, they pushed in, rendering them useless. In another peg, the screw came out of it completely, due to no traction. One issue we could resolve on our own, but this is really bad. Not worth it at all."
2,Not worth the money :(,"I loved this when I first saw it! Great size, perfect color scheme for both genders, etc. But, like the others have said, the pegs just don't hold. I'm in the process of trying to find a solution that will not render this useless. Set screws with glue? Dowels? Not sure, anyone have suggestions? I would hate to toss this out...:("
1,Disappointed!,"I purchased this to hang all of my children's costumes. But when it arrived it had missing pieces. Instead of returning it, my husband tried to fix. But after a few uses, the wood started splitting and it never stays up! I am very disappointed in this product and now have to purchase a new one! Don't waste your time and money on this one!"
2,Not worth it,i just received this coat rack. It does not stand up straight. One of the pegs is cracked and I can barely screw in the pegs. I was really disappointed with what I received and I am sending it back.
4,Nice Rack for Kids,"I bought this rack to hold my children's coats, it works perfectly! The rack stands about 4 ft tall assembled and is the perfect height for a 6 and 4 year old to hang their coats and book bags from school."
1,Pegs didn't hold weight,The pegs were completely useless to hold any weight. They didn't stay in well when assembled and fell out with the slightest pressure on them. I tried all the pegs. None were usable. The whole rack went right back in the box.
3,coat rack,The pegs on the rack all were not strong and some did not screw exactly right in the holes. I had to glue them so they would be strong enough to hold heavier items.
1,rack,I was VERY disappointed in the quality of this product.....My husband had to reinsert ALL of the hooks because they all came out and nvere relly stayed screwed into the stand....
1,Poor quality.,The inserts that the pegs screw into are very loose. 4 of the 8 came out completely and are useless until I fix them myself.
1,Generally Disappointed,"Dry and overly technical. As an aspiring lawyer and an armchair orator, I didn't find very much that I could readily apply to the nuts and bolts of my speech writing or delivery."
2,I Can't Do It!,"I tried this video several times and couldn't do much of it. I had a few years of ballet in college and a few years of ballet workout class. My teachers then were entertaining and encouraging and broke a sweat, unlike Melissa Lowe, who is like the girl you hated in high school only with less personality. I suppose I could put up with her and try to learn all the moves on the video without her explaining them, but it's easier to just do aerobics."
3,Not as instructional as billed.....,"Lowe is a beautiful dancer, but she does not explain how to do the specific steps. She and her staff just quickly run through the routines without explaining HOW to do all of them.This video is useful in showing you how the steps are supposed to be executed (from front and back), and the form is almost perfect. But i feel it goes by too quickly to really let you keep up (unless you are advanced, and then you don't need this video).She has some good stretching exercises, but one thing i found very disturbing is that she doesn't explain ""turn-out"" -- she mentions that it is important, but she doesn't say HOW to exercise to achieve it. You can injure yourself (back and knees to start with) by not doing it properly while attempting some of these exercises. She probably explains it in her first video, but i think she should explain it again.Use this video as reference only, or if you are already a good dancer as a warm-up or reminder. It's really not instructional."
4,lovely,"I am an ex ballet dancer over 50 who can no longer do many things, eg. jump. But, I can do this excellent workout and modify it to suit my needs. Melissa Lowe's technique is pretty solid and this is the tape I go to time and time again. I wish there were a degree of difficulty between numbers I and II, though. These old bones, ain't what they used to be."
3,can't say,"I have been taking ballet since I was three, only quitting for a few years inbetween now in then. I am a member of a ballet company and I am pretty experienced with ballet, so I found this workout way too easy."
3,Too Much Talk,"As with other workout videos, I found the ballet workout much more talk and explanation than actual workout. For once, I wish someone would put out an exercise video where one could just DO the exercises without all the chatter.It might help to know that I have taken ballet class for several years, am familiar with all of the positions, etc. and therefore am not interested in all of the ""stopping"" the action to assure correct placement of arms, feet, etc.Please someone out there put out a video without all the talk!"
4,helpful,"I am an x dancer and ballet teacher...over 60..I take jazzercise 4 days a week, but come back to this video because I would like to regain the ""long"" dancer look....that nothing but ballet gives you...the video allows you to work slowly with help"
2,"Dull, Mechanical, Ho-Hum","I took a couple of years of ballet in college (a few years back). It was an excellent workout and always a joyous experience. And, as a musician, it helped me with phrasing, posture, etc. I think dancing should at least be slightly fun. It looks as if Miss Lowe has done this all her life. No doubt she is an excellent dancer, but she lacks all enthusiasm as a teacher. Also, she doesn't give a run-down of the steps before doing floor exercises. I could get the adagio after a few repitions, but not faster-paced stuff--some explanation would help and could be put at the beginning or ending of the tape so one wouldn't have to watch it after learning it. There must be better tapes."
4,Pretty good,"While doing this workout you can feel some discomfort but the next day you should really be able to feel as if you've had an effective workout in your legs. It works out the entire body and even though I haven't had this product long; I can see that it won't be long before I reach my goal weight. Good product for toning, slimming, inch reduction, posture improvement and more muscular strength(not bulky or manly muscles, just noticed strength, balance, flexibility and posture). At times the instructor goes a tad bit quickly and the angle the DVD is shot at changes and you kind of have to figure out what you're doing on your own, but after doing it more and more you'll be just fine."
4,Be careful with the stretches!,"The ballet portions of this DVD are great, but it is a little dated, so some of the stretches have been found to do more harm than good. What ever you do, don't bounce! It doesn't give your muscles a chance to ease into the stretch, and most defiantly doesn't help to make them more flexible. I had been hoping for something that had been made a bit more recently, but is looks like it had been taped in the 80's from the video quality and the copious amounts of leg warmers."
3,Solid ballet instruction for beginners,"I think other reviewers have already summed up this tape so I'll keep it short and just add my two cents. If you aren't used to ballet, these exercises will make you s-o-o-o-r-e the next day for a little while! :) My only qualm is that I find this a bit dull, from Melissa's instruction, to the sets and music. Good workout, though."
3,Begginer Ballet Video?,"If I did not dance ballet all my life I would be lost in the video. Melissa Lowe dose not tell you the excerise before hand and she expects you to follow along which is ridculouse. Ballet class is hard enough when your teacher gives you the excersise. She also does not give enough excersies to build technique such as battment tendues, battment jetes, developpes and releve longs. No wonder why studemt have a hard time keeping there balance in the center but, if you add two battment tendue excerises, another adagio, my own floor bar, and one jete excersie the class is acceptable."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, as the subject is a very interesting one. Alas, Ms Hawkes writing style would surely be a boon to insomniacs if it could be condensed and put into a bottle. And quite aside from its potent lethean side effects, it is at times immensely irritating, as in ""and now I am going to talk about the next thing I intend to talk about..."" Aaargh. And then there is the frustrating defect of much writing from those of academia, the ""just-who-in-the-hell-am-I-writing-for?"" neurosis: the book seems aimed at a general lay audience, yet esoteric terms and proper nouns are tossed off like so many sparkles on a birthday cake, words familiar only to those with a graduate education in the subject. It reminds me of an old Monty Python skit, about the RAF pilots trying to make sense of their banter.But, the book is nicely illustrated. Whoopie."
2,"Book, The Atlas of Early Man","I think that JC Store should have contacted meabout the unavailability of this book because itwas out of stock. Instead, I waited and watchedfor it and finally wrote Amazon.com, receivingthe reply that the book was unavailable fromthem."
2,Too wide.,I am of average weight and I found the seat too wide as it tends to wrap around me and is therfore uncomfortable. The less expensive model is better.
2,Feel like I'm hanging by a thread when sitting in the crazy creek comfort chair,"I was surprised to discover that the Crazy Creek Comfort Chair is a piece of slightly padded waterproof canvas material that functions as a chair as long as the straps don't break. And they haven't. But I don't feel secure when I'm sitting in the chair. I also feel like I'm on the verge of toppling back if I lean back, which is the whole point I ordered the chair: for back support. And although the straps are adjustable, the only way I feel secure is if I have the straps tightened all the way, which doesn't seem like a heck of a lot of flexibility to me. It's also a bit tricky if I want to reach anything that's not immediately next to me.Needless to say, the chair is not what I expected.Still, I do have something nice to say: The chair is light and compact, and I'd rather use this chair, as flimsy as it seems, than not have any support at all."
3,Not bad...but couldn't sit in for hours at a time,"I ordered 2 of these chairs. Got the ""comfort"" chair over the standard b/c it was supposed to be wider and taller. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'8"". These chairs were also supposed to have thicker padding than the standard. I would rate these ""standard"" at best. They aren't super comfy and I don't think we could stand to use them for hours on end. That being said, they will be useful for short picnics in the park, etc. The carrying straps are nice & they're light/portable. We have only tried using them on the ground (not on stadium bleachers: maybe that will be more comfortable.) It does help to tighten the straps more than you'd think you'd need to. Makes it a bit more supportive - otherwise you get a great ab workout!! :)"
5,Simple comfort!,I bought this for my daughter to use at summer camp. This design was larger than the regular model so was high enough in the back to provide great head support for her. I also love using it and it's super comfortable! I used it on the beach and it's much lighter and more cozy than a beach chair.
1,Not as described,"The description clearly says this has a zippered mesh pocket and a water bottle holder. No, it doesn't. It's just the basic chair. So back it goes."
4,Crazy for Crazy Creek,"I love this chair. It is comfortable and slim/easy for storage. People make fun of me because I'd rather sit in my Crazy Creek than on the sofa.After a while my lower back starts to hurt, but that's about 2 hours in. Otherwise it's great. And there's a drink holder! What more could you ask for?"
5,Sideline Effects,"The statement, ""fighting for your life"" has new meaning when used to describe nine-year-old Joey. This suspense filled drama, Something For Joey, tackled us. When you read about Joey (a boy suffering from leukemia) and the side effects he has from the common childhood disease, chickenpox, your emotions will fumble. The combination of compassion and action kept us interested in the book until the very last page. ""John was at his side, at Joey's side, the whole time he was sick."" This book was at our side until it was finished."
5,Something For Joey book,"This is a great true story. Very, very inspiring and touching. Arrived early in perfect condition. Very fair price. Highly recommend this book!!"
3,Something for Joey,My son has read this and liked most of the book. It pertains to a young boy and his life.
2,Something for the sensitive,"Fun! Exciting! Action Packed! That's NOT Something for Joey. Based on the cover you may think this is a football book. We got tricked into that, also. The book's main subject isn't totally based on football; it's a loving book about the relationship of a boy and his brother. The most fast-action pass we received was when the little boy goes to the hospital. This book is for people who want a serious novel with a well thought-out meaning. This is not for someone who wants a funny, action packed story."
5,A visually artistic treat,"This is by far the best photography of classic dressage on the market. The movie was made for everyone who appreciates the highest level of riding and training philosophies on earth today. It is a special treat for the heart of the artist. Anyone who is touched by the visual arts, love for classical dressage, and an equine miracle, will need to own this movie! I gave it out 4 times for Christmas."
3,Great cookies,"And the book was okay too. If you want deep compelling fiction move on down the road, but if you like a light story with great cookie receipies this is for you."
4,Fudge Cupcake Murder,"This was one of my Fiance's X-mas gifts. She hasn't got to read it yet, but she's really looking forward to it."
5,Delicious Small Town Murder,"If cozies are your cup of tea, you'll savor this latest entry in the popular Hannah Swensen series. It's charming, chatty, pleasant, and easy to digest. Adding to the fun are the several original (and quite good) cookie recipes and enough baking tips to warrant keeping Fudge Cupcake Murder on the shelves in the kitchen.--Marcianne Miller, author of The Artful Cupcake"
2,predictable,"pretty flat, the Norman and Bill saga is getting really old. As much as I love Hannah, sometimes I wish that the two guys would just dump her and move on."
5,fudge cupcake murder,I love this author. She does such a great job in making you feel like you are part of the mystery. The recipes that she includes in the books are really good. I read one of her stories to my students who love to try to figure out who has commited the crime and why they did it. I can hardly wait for the next murder.
4,Definately worth having,"Rifkin's Bach is different, not only for the extreme clarity of musical line and texts due to the use of one voice per line in the chorus, but to Rifkin's brisk and lively tempi. His is one on the few modern recordings of BWV106's openning chorus that resembles the old Scherchen. Purely a matter of taste, but definately worth having. At the price, it's a bargain. The solists are not always first rate, but they're good. Be advised that the second disc is essentially the same material as on Kooy's all basso cantata disc, but Rifkin's Bach remains all his own. The bass, however, lacks the emotion of some of the best solists.Anyone who is truly responsive to the Bach cantatas cannot be satisfied with only one performance of any of the great ones. If Rifkin is not your first choice, it still should be in any Bach collection."
3,Cool idea but not the most functional,"My friend has this case and likes it, but I was not happy with mine. It was great quality and cool looking, but it was so hard to get in and out of your pocket, and EVERYTHING (i.e. lint, dirt, dust) sticks to it. I prefer my new case that is a thin hard clear plastic - more protection, easier to maneuver. If you're looking for a silicone sleeve-type case, this is a good one, but it's just not for me."
4,Good Grant overview......,"I have to admit, the whole grant process is overwhelming to me, but this book walks you through all the steps, and has made everything much more clear. Still not an easy process, but this helped it make more sense."
1,Too basic.,"If you know how to cook at all, this book is useless. There is seriously a recipe in here on how to cook plain ol' white rice. You can learn how to cook rice right on the package it comes in for goodness sakes! The recipe for pot roast is terrible, unless you just want a roast cooked in water with hardly any seasoning.This book was a waste of money!"
5,The milk free kitchen,This is a great book to help educate you about milk allergies and also recipes.
2,Margarine?,There is one glaring problem in this book. Nearly all margarine contains milk. I did not find a warning about this anywhere in her book. Many of her recipes call for margarine.
4,Very Handy,I have used this book for many years since my son was diagnosed with both a milk and egg allergy. The recipes are generally uncomplicated and tend to use ingredients that are easily available.The cake and cookie recipes are especially useful. I have used her recipes for golden cake and quick chocolate cake along with her frosting recipes for many birthday parties. The breakfast molasses cookies make terrific gingerbread men.
4,Good for those allergic to milk and soy,My son is allergic to both dairy and soy. about 1/5th of all those with milk allergies are also allergic to soy. This book provides many recipes that do not rely heavily on milk substitutes and thus are a Godsend to thus of us who can't just add soy to make it work.
1,Also Disappointed,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this book was not helpful for those struggling with a milk allergy. I have a 2 1/2 year old who is casein and gluten intolerant and I was hoping for some ideas to fill in for the missing cheese and bread options for him. I can easily substitute other milks in a milk based recipes, what I was hoping for were some tried and true substitutes that might pique his interest. What I got were some of the same old recipes without milk in them...and this book is recommended by U of Fla. for people participating in their testing...we'll have to find them a better book to recommend..."
5,Don't be afrain to grow up,"This book, if you let the truth drill into the core of who you are, will change your life. So many of us, homosexual or even weak hetersexual, refuse to face the facts. At some point in our life we experienced something traumatic, real or even imagined. It injured us in such a way that we withdrew into ourselves and our fantasies.I think I always knew this, but I was afraid to admit it. More, I had no idea how to get beyond my self-pity and feelings of being victimized.Alan Medinger's book gave me the road map I needed, a road map gleaned from painful experience. Just reading the back page in the bookstore I began to feel something working in me. I realize now it was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of truth.In Christ, and with the power of the His Spirit, I know I can be the man God always wanted me to be. And you (if you're a man, of course) can too."
4,How Boys Turn Into Men,"Growth into Manhood: Resuming the JourneyThis book appears at first glance to be directed toward men recovering from homosexual tendencies. But it is equally helpful in understanding the process by which any boy gains a true sense of manhood. Medinger contends that homosexually oriented men are men whose growth into comfortable and confident manhood was arrested, often by lack of affirmation (or worse yet, outright rejection by) their father figure. For dads looking to avoid and compensate for mistakes in raising their boys, this book identifies the real ""hot button"" issues, the ones that can make or break their boys. For men wanting to ""resume the journey"" this book provides helpful insights."
1,Outlawed in Ecuador,"Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador. That's right, people like the author can be, and should be, arrested if they go to Ecuador and try practicing this voodoo. These therapists all seem alike. They all think that being gay has something to do with effeminacy, they all think that homosexuality is a disorder or disease or problem or whatever, they all think that you should switch to heterosexuality because organized religion says so, they all think that psychoanalytic psychotherapeutic psychotherapy has all the answers, the answers always having something to do with your parents or your failure to play football or whatever, and all of these voodoo priests are Republicans who get their news from Fox or World Net Daily. I dare you to find even one reparative therapist who is a Democrat. Why is it that a man can't be a ""real"" man unless he prefers football to Shakespeare?"
1,Just so much hooey . . . .,"This book is one stinking pile of hooey. It is NOT worth reading, even if you get it free from a library. It is an insult to every gay man or woman who buys books from Amazon that this book is included in the gay section. At best it should be included in the ""Christian"" section if it has to be included at all."
5,Essential live Coltrane,"This album has for years been a second-class citizen to its more famous cousins from Birdland and the Village Vanguard, however this is truly a must have for Coltrane fans. The energy of performance and synergy of the players epitomizes the quality of this quartet. The highlights include a blasting performance of the not often performed ""Cousin Mary"" and a vintage performance of ""I Want to Talk About You"" whose coda excedes the perforances at Birdland. Tyner is in top form, but the finest moments are between Coltrane and Elvin Jones whose ferocity matches perfectly with Coltrane throughout. Overall, I have many Coltrane CD's, including the complete Vanguard box set, and I find myself playing this one the most."
4,Good quality live recording from Oct/Nov 1963 in Europe,"The sound is not as bad as the prior reviewer said it was. This album (not on Impulse! ) is an amalgamation of the 10-22-63 concert in Stockholm, and the 11-3-63 concert in Berlin. The music is as powerful as you would expect from this legendary band. Check out the version of ""Lonnie's Lament"" which predates the studio version recorded in April of 1964. Also of interest; the cadenza from ""I Want To Talk About You"" ( compare to the famous version recorded on ""Live at Birdland"" lp ). This cd contains a 20 minute version of ""My Favorite Things"". There are many beautiful moments."
4,"One Of ""My Favorites""....","While not perfect, personally I listen to this one for ""My Favorite Things""....One of his best performances of this tune(in fact, I like his live ""Things"" better than his studio recording, and that one was fairly decent). Any other opinions??"
5,must have.,They say the review must be 20 words or more.Astounding.Inspired.Swinging.Urgent.Deep.Profound.Classic.Blues.Spiritual.Enlightening.Been playing jazz 30 years.Have listened to thousands of hours-From Bix to Bitches.This recording is a must listen.
4,"perfect performance, badly produced","what a travesty! some of the finest trane ever--1963, when this band was tightest (as compared to same songs on 'Village Vanguard') But WHO PRODUCED THIS? You can't hear Elvin drumming. McCoy fades in and out. Overall, sounds like a bad bootleg."
3,Not Birdland or Village Vanguard,"There are moments on this live date that are as good as it gets, but there are also moments when Coltrane falls apart and loses his bearings. Like any live recording, though, he shouldn't be punished for stretching the material. Some of Tyner's solos are truly incredible. It should be added that I am a pre-Impulse Coltrane fan and save 'Love Supreme', 'Coltrane' and 'First Meditations', I don't have the patience for his post hard-bop excursions. However, this is a million times more accessible thansome of the later stuff he did with Pharoah Sanders and Rashied Ali, when being lyrical and keeping any kind of time was considered to be a form of selling out."
4,Pretty Good,"This album has caught a lot of bad press over the years because most critics have voiced the opinion that none of the participants were fully engaged in this project. This can safely be called THE David Crosby Byrds album. He's all over the music. Chris Hillman and Roger McGuinn back up and audibly let David have his way. Gene Clark and David are in fine voice and the cover songs are great. ""See The Sky About To Rain"" is awesome and McGuinn's ""Rock-n-Roll"" is very ragged but very right. Crosby got a great sound on this record. The instruments and vocals are crystal clear. It is one of my all-time favorite Byrds Albums. It's better,in its way, than anything after ""Notorious""."
4,Byrds Reunion Album Not A Bust...,"This album received alot of negative press. I assume the critics were thinking that by reuniting the original Byrds would create a masterpiece of Byrds sounding songs. Instead they got an album of good country rock songs from five very influential musicians. Obviously Crosby,Hillman,McGuinn,Clark and Clarke were at a different stage musically in their careers when this album came out. They had moved on from the more pop oriented sound of the Byrds. Some very solid song writing(""Long Live The King"",""For Free"" some good covers(Neil Young's ""See The Sky(About To Rain)"" and ""Cowgirl In The Sand"" and most of all some quality musicianship(love the mandolin fills throughout the album) lead to an underappreciated effort. I think most people would be pleasantly surprised by this cd."
4,"Great album, several homeruns","It's such a shame that this record still spilts Byrds fans after all these years.I loved this album when it first came out and still think it's great. The Gene Clark songs are all homeruns, whether he's singing his or Neil Young's songs. Crosby did a great job getting the acoustic instruments to pop out and sing. Makes sense that the electric 12-string is de-emphasized here.What a shame these guys couldn't get along.I see another fan didn't like Crosby's version of For Free, but I think this version's a great interpretation that takes advantage of the best of what this version of the Byrds had to offer."
4,Underrated,"I can't understand why this album is so underrated. It features great vocals by the late great Gene Clark, wonderful mandolin picking by Chris Hillman (missing from most Byrds albums), the familiar reedy vocals by Roger McGuinn, and good songs on every track. The ringing 12-string (I think) electric solo on the last track by McGuinn (or maybe it's Hillman) on the last track is worth the price of the album. One of my favorite records."
2,The Last Official Byrds Studio Album.,"As far I am concerned The Byrds are the greatest band of all time.Therefore for me to give 2 out 5 stars indicates that something is seriously wrong.I have owned this CD for some years and have just played it again.I can only recommend 2 songs, which are Full Circle, and (See The Sky) About To Rain, and neither can be described as must haves.With the best will in the world this must be the least important album to have, so if you don't know The Byrds, please try any other of their many releases."
3,A nicely written book,The Pistachio Prescription is a nicely written book. It is both funny and sad which makes it very realistic. Well characterized
4,Maggese,"If you like Italian pop music, you will like Cesare Cremonini (lead singer of Luna Pop). His lyrics are slightly corny but are backed up by his obviously thorough musical training as evidenced by the less-than-obvious chord changes, instrumentation, and electronic sounds.There is a lengthy piano piece at the end which is incongruous on an album full of commercial pop. It seems that with Cesare's fame he is able to take more liberties on his latest albums, and the out-of-place piano rambling along with the odd ghost track are evidence of this.The songs themselves, though, are enjoyable and the album as a whole is well done."
3,Not for the serious fisherman,Bought the fishing pole for easy traveling in my truck. Mechanically there is nothing special. It works good and is convenient.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this for my 99-year-old dad's new trike. The throw on the old lever was so short that it would hit the grip before fully engaging the brake. This lever is a little better, though not great. I could have spent a lot more on Shimano, but was looking for a bargain. This works, I guess."
2,meh,"heavy, and it doesn't seem to accept any normal-size ferrule, so your cable may flop around if not under proper tension"
1,makita impact wrench,"cost me $900, and is no good to me. in australia we have 240 volts and it is 120volts. it will cost me $150 to send back and i probally wont get my money back. so the only quality in the deal was my money."
5,another wonderful album from a great singer !,"Aida Cuevas has one of the most beautiful voices ever, powerful, emotional, and flawless. This album is another one of her wonderful collection of beautiful songs. Aida is simply the best! I also recommend her other albums like Enhorabuena, and the some of her compilations of rancheras."
4,"The Bogman: history, sociology or love story?","The historical context for this novel set in 20th century provincial, rural Ireland, belies the extraordinary relevance it has to the state of the human condition. This is one of those novels which subtly interweave levels of meaning, knowledge, and emotionality, all through the standard conventions of plot--ultimately leaving an indelible impression regarding not only the social conditions of the people and period described, but also the universal contradictions which all people must deal with. Highly recommended read."
5,Irwin Industrial Tools,"Really like the set, the price for these tools was a good price and my husband uses them allot. They work well especially when working on his cars."
3,Good for on the go .,Good quality but not enough room. The pouches are deep but not wide enough for practical more frequent used items (Bottles or more than one bib).
5,Hysterical Journey for the Questioning Soul,"The minute I inadvertently laughed out loud in the bookstore, I knew I had to get this book. It had a wonderful conversational style that sucked me in.I, also, am not certain of the presence of God. Set up in a series of letters to God, this book is often funny, heartbreaking, thoughtful, questioning, and inspiring... The question is, is there more to life? The letters themselves are not long, ranging from a page to several pages long.What made the book so compelling for me is, even though the letters are to God, the author admits ""God"" could be anything... a force, a higher power, ourselves. He also questions when he began to lose faith, not only in God but also in himself.It's not just about a search for God, it's also about our search for ourselves. What makes us special? Why we make the choices we do...Can we make different choices? I highly recommend this book."
1,nothing new here,"I bet your garden variety evangelist would annoy this enlightened author. But it's perfectly OK for every ""spiritual"" expert to gang up on us athiests. The party line is that athiests would inevitably believe if we would just spend some time delving into our spiritual potential. For some reason athiests are an irresistable project for self-styled spiritualists of every ilk and stripe.You know what? I have my own navel to gaze into, I'm sure yours is nice, but I'm doing just fine with my own."
4,Weird,The product is said to be 30 feet long in the title but the description says it is 25 feet long. Either way more than enough for a couple racquets.
1,Doesn't stay stuck on,I just applied this to my raquets and it doesn't stay stuck very well. Never used a head protector but this surely doesn't seem like it will stay. I read a review that says it gets more sticky after a couple days. We'll see... I'll update if the stickiness increases. If it doesn't get any stickier it will be essentially useless and fall off in no time at all.
3,Radio play,"I have the radio on a particular station everyday & on Saturday arvos country music is played. I heard MATCHBOX, emailed for details re who & what. You had it, I got it."
3,Really works on high temperature but too soft to handle sticky food,"This turner really works on high temperature. It doesn't change its shape or melt. However, unless you have a really good non-stick frying pan I suggest you should stick with a nylon turner. If you are frying rice or anything sticky on high heat, the food will stick on the pan, and this silicone turner won't have enough strength to lift it up, making the food get burnt."
4,Hilliard and Kremer - superb!,"Some of the work on this CD is minimalist. That is, not much variation in the space of five or six minutes. However, the Hillaird Ensemble produce chorale music. So that's understandible.Almost as important for me was the apearance of Gidon Kremer. Being a fan of his work, this collaboration between Hilliard, Kremer and the music of Arvo Part is an exciting listen.Kremer does a fine job on two of the tracks. The final track on the album includes Kremer and is some 23:53 long - so it's not a minor work.If I had to put forth one criticsm it's the inclusion of the title track ""Arbos"" which is annoyingly upbeat - if searching. It appears twice on the CD. It's not bad music, just not at all in keeping with the rest of the CD. It only lasts 2:25 so isn't too bad. But if you only heard that one track you would have no idea of what the rest of this musci sounds like.Overall - a solid CD."

5,A practical guide to loyalty marketing,"I work in the field of loyalty and customer marketing and am always on the hunt for sources that will show my clients real world examples of loyalty marketing in action. Brian Woolf does a superb job in presenting examples from loyalty programs that are making a difference in businesses around the globe. He reminds his readers of three important tenets often misunderstood by the inexperienced marketer: first: to focus on strategy before tactics,tools or points; second: to identify what the customer perceives is a loyalty motivator; and third: that you can gain customer loyalty without having to give up any gross margin."
5,Loyalty Marketing: The Second Act,"I have read Brian Woolf's two most recent works on loyalty marketing. For many, the world of loyalty marketing and its results may seem incomprehensible, or worse yet, unquantifiable. However, in his new book, ""Loyalty Marketing: The Second Act"", Brian has conveyed the importance and power of building real loyalty with the consumer. His frequent use of case studies spanning several industries, illustrates and quantifies the benefits of building an effective loyalty program and putting it to work in even the most competitive and mature of markets. In today's business environment, it's not enough to simply attract new customers. The silver bullet for success is the ability to retain those customers through the years to come.Whether you are a proprietor or charged with the marketing initiatives of a large retailer, Brian's real-life examples and insights captured in his latest book, will give you the competitive edge to secure profitable and loyal customers."
5,Brian Woolf has done it again!,"To me, Brian Woolffs Customer SpecificMarketing(1996) is one of the most revolutionary and influential business books ever published in Japan. His fundamental concept of gall the customers are notequalh there is finely sublimed into a practical marketing concept of gBest CustomerStrategyh in his latest book Loyalty Marketing. With a lot of in depth case studies of some of the most successful loyalty companies of the world, this book will be a practical guide for Japanese retailers who want to win customersfloyalty."
4,Have a go at it!,"Read the other review from Wooley, it is excellent.I just want to add my 4 stars. It is a shame that there are no more reviews of this interesting book. I know and like the idea that Wellington had not only better seamen - he protected them from scorbut because he was well organized and got fresh food while the French had little concern for the sailors - but he also had better spies. It pleases me. Better spies is the subject of this book. How can you miss it? If you don't know that the banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild made his fortune by getting news one day early of Newton's victory,The House of Rothschild: Volume 1: Money's Prophets: 1798-1848let me tell you, you miss all the fun.Curiosity killed the cat, it won't kill you."
5,Gibson Stainless Exhaust,"I was able to install this in my driveway without the benefit of a lift. It fits great, and there are zero clearance issues or rattles. Definitely a high quality part and it sounds great. I would buy the same exhaust again if given the choice."
1,So WHAT,"I didn't really get much out of reading this. It was a bunch of poorly constructed essays that rambled on forever without making any important points. I was curious as to what the women (aside from Miss. Shamburg were like)that worked with her-- but she really didn't write about much other than herself, her grandmother and some clients she saw.I also felt that by Shamburg saying she couldn't tell the readers any more because she had to protect her client (a writer's duty--or something to that extent), she was really just covering up her inability to write anything meaningful. Major disapointment. There's no life to this book. I can't imagine why anyone would find this insightful. Perhaps because there aren't many other books out there written about S&M in this manner?"
5,Book Club Selection,"This is one the funniest books I've ever read. Shamburg's world is outlandish, yet her insights into human nature and modern culture make it uncannily familiar and funny. She manages to resist trite analysis and give a humorous, touching and varied yarn. It's one of the most original books I've read in a while - this book is about S&M like The Catcher in the Rye is about college prep.You won't be able to put it down."
1,Mistress ruby ties it together,"A very disappointing book. Just a series of very short essays that do not tell you a lot about the business, merely hinting at some of the subjects, and showing Mz Shamburg's view of human nature, and the types of male that come to a dominatrix.I feel angry with her that she raises people's expectations that they are going to learn something and then there is nothing there. You feel as if you have been totally mislead.Mz Shamburg wrote a series of articles for her local paper while she was acting as a dominatrix, and these may well be some or all of them, I have the feeling, reproduced in this book.This book really has nothing to offer, and you would be best to save your money, and your disappointment and look for another book on the subject."

5,Scotch Self Laminating ID protectors,"This is a perfect item for a small business needing individualized badges. Its simplistic use and the inclusion of clips makes it a total option. All we needed was to create our badge templates via a word document, cut and paste!. The option of free super saver shipping made this item less than I could get from a local store."
5,Solid tool for the professional.,"This crimper is top notch. It is solidly built and I haven't had a faulty connection yet. I bought a used one from Amazon and it was in perfect condition. If you don't want to pull your hair out trying to figure out what is wrong with your ethernet system, buy this crimper instead of a cheap Chinese knock off. And if you buy this to replace your cheap unit, don't try to sell the old one. Throw it away."
5,3rd Issue,"This third issue of Asimov's long-running magazine has stories by some great authors including Poul Anderson, A. Bertram Chandler, Stephen Goldin, Jack C. Haldeman II, Asimov himself, Dean McLaughlin, and Martin Gardner. Great reading for any sci-fi fan who just can't get enough."
5,Captured Memories,Not new to Glen Yarbrough. This is a replacement for vinyl which is no longer played. So good to have him back! His voice is so unusual.
4,"Baby, you're gonna love this one!","Glenn Yarbrough was the one record I played over and over and over again.All these years later, his voice takes me back to my college days and helps me remember the Good Times! Never get tired of listening to his music."
3,Was great when it was new -- does not hold up today,"This was my favorite Depeche Mode album for a long time. But like a lot of earlier Depeche Mode, I just don't think this holds up anymore. It's not the timeless pop classic that Violator is, and doesn't have the sophistication of Songs of Faith and Devotion. Pretty much everything before Music for the Masses is just hard to appreciate now except in a historical sense.If you're exploring the early years of Depeche Mode, or trying to round out the collection, it's a worthwhile buy. If you are new to DM and are looking for just any DM to buy, first get Violator and SOFAD if you don't already have them."
5,In my opinion ..,"In my opinion this is the best DM release,it's arguable but in my opinion it is,the reason i think so is because it's darker than the other releases plus i picked it up really cheap at a record shop a must own!"
3,Typical hit and miss collection,"More consistent than A Broken Frame and featuring the fabulous ""Everything Counts,"" Construction Time Again nevertheless has its share of duds. While Gore and Wilder's two collaborations, ""Two Minute Warning"" and ""The Landscape Is Changing,"" as well as Gore's moody ""Shame,"" are worthy (but unspectacular) pop songs, ""Pipeline"" and its working class hero sentiment (complete with metal clanking sounds) is flat out boring, ""More Than a Party"" fails in its attempt to be upbeat, and ""And Then..."" finishes things off in dirge-like fashion with pessimistic lyrics that foreshadowed things to come. On this album, and ""Pipeline"" in particular, Depeche Mode started to tinker with the industrial sound that would make ""People Are People"" a huge success the following year. Casual fans can skip this album in favor of the concise and representative The Singles 81>85."
4,"Mode, part Two","This is where DM began to diversify musically, combining samples and acoustic guitar work with their synthesizers, and it is the first indication of where they would go. Lyrically it's all a bit naive and earnest, but that's actually part of its charm. There's hardly a dud song in the bunch, even the slightly annoying Love,In Itself has a chorus that lifts it to greater heights than it should rightly be allowed. Also here is the first song that can be considered a DM ""classic"" in the form of Everything Counts, which has the best lyric on the album ( not to mention one of Martin Gore's finest ever.) CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN is a real winner - one of DM's best - and it still holds up more than twenty years later."
4,Mind Traveled too far,"This is in response to mind traveler...You should check out Recoil, then compare it to Depeche Mode now... You mention you hate this album out of all of them...but then you mention you hated Ultra and Exciter...the albums that Alan wasn't on... For he made their sound more full and interesting... with the piano and strings and deep analog bass... back in the day Alan was the only one that had any musical talent in the band... and the other band members admited it... Violater, and Love, Faith, Devotion was most influenced by Alan... You should check your facts better..."
2,This book is for BEGINNERS,"I was disappointed with the purchase of this book, it is for folks just starting out in banner making."
2,crap,"they ship really fast..which is nice, but ultimatly, this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine...it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures, plus the stone is not ""garnet"" it more so resembles the color brown...like a turd."
2,poor service,"It took over a month to get my product from this company.I will not order from them again. When I did get the ear rings, they were much smaller than they seemed in the picture. It would be nice to have some sort of picture scale to see the size of the item being purchased."
2,Sterling Silver Celtic Knot NOT so Red Garnet Earrings,"I had received the earrings I purchased on Amazon and they were supposed to be RED garnets. But their color is far closer to Amber than red (as was pictured) and I was very disappointed. I wrote my problem to Amazon and to date have had no response. I had asked back then to either send replacement pair sent (at NO additional shipping charges to ME) that someone actually CHECKS the color or I would send these back for a full refund. The style is very cute - I even like the accompanying necklace and ring designs - HOWEVER....I then wrote to 6 different departments at Amazon asking for help with an exchange --- to this day, WEEKS later, None of the departments has responded. The holidays are now passed - I have a gift I could not give.Disappointed."
5,Awesome earrings,"I love these earrings. They are a great length. The garnet is a nice shade and neutral enough to go with most colors. Also, the knot work is very pretty. These can be worn dressy or casual."
3,"Not what I expected, but still seems to be pretty good paper","I did a test print and it seems to be pretty decent. I would recommend it if this is the type of paper you are looking for. I may possibly be looking for light gloss, but will still find a use for this."
2,QUESTION,I only gave it 3 stars because it wouldn't let me question this without giving a star. It does not state the weight of the paper. What is the weight of the paper. This is very important to me.
3,NOT DOUBLE-SIDED,"I haven't read the product description on this, but I wanted to call it to everyone's attention, just in case, that this paper is not considered double sided. One side is whiter and slicker than the other. The printing on the ""back"" is not as saturated and sharp, so be warned."
5,"A standard, I both care about images and understand how they work","A standard, I both care about images and understand how they work. This paper is faithful and reliable."
3,"Good racket, but really bad grip","I found this product for cheaper, if you go directly to the vendor's site. The racket itself is pretty decent - I like the sweet spot, and it hits pretty well, actually. It is pretty light-weight, and easy to play with. The one bad thing is that they cheaped-out big-time on the grip tape. It falls apart even after a single session. I would pay an extra 50 cents to have it be better. In the end, you have to go get some cheap grip tape and tape it yourself. Kind of a pain, but at this price, it is worth-while."
4,Just one minor thing...,"The store didn't send the invoice, so to pay takes they calculate them on an average of a list of squash racket, of course with the most expensive ones. In consecuence I payed 5 times more for what I payed for the product. Not good"
3,Incomplete,"I was very interested in Ms.Vanderbilt's story and experience with the death of her son. I, too, lost a 25-yr old son, Zachary, in July, 2003. His death was a tragedy, also, and I have sought answers since his death. In my son's case, there are significant events that influenced his life and hastened his death. He has a twin brother, Alan, who is not the same person since losing his brother. I can't accept that these tragedies do not have underlying causes. In Ms. Vanderbilt's story, all was well in his life and the event ""just happened."" I expected candor in her story to enlighten the reader."
2,Not what I expected.,"I saw this book advertised on tv when Ms Vanderbuilt was a guest. We recently lost our granddaughter and I thought this book was going to help us work through the grief by reading Gloria Vanderbuilt's story of her son's death. I bought two copies. One for myself and one for my daughter. Personally I feel I wasted my money. While I feel deep sorrow for Ms. Vanderbuilt and her loss, the book is more about her life than about facing the loss of her son. I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. THE BOOK IS POORLY WRITTEN......SCATTERED."
1,Hard to install,"Very difficult to install. Once we got one attached, we found we couldn't get our fingers in to depress the latch and open the cabinet door; the latches are too short. Very frustrating!"
2,"Consider other options, first","Got these because they were the only ones at the store. They looked good in the package, but looks were deceiving. They are really difficult to install correctly, and I have lots of experience working with wood and cabinets. They are made of a light weight plastic that distorts when tightening the screws, causing the latch to go out of alignment. Alignment is critical. If the latch is a little low, it doesn't catch. A little high and it jambs against the catch and breaks off. I've replaced about half of the latches in about a year's time. I'm replacing them now with sturdier latches from another manufacturer.I do not recommend. Moreover, I am more critical of any product from this company."
3,Great ideas !,I got this book looking for new ideas of finger plays to do with my two month old. Other than the pat-a-cake and this little piggy standbys all of the others were new to me and this is my third child! The directions were clear and he really loves the activities. The illustrations are cute but not captivating. Once you learn the finger plays you really don't need the book. I would recommend it as a shower gift for a new mother though who would find it full of good ideas for playing with a new baby.
4,Lovely book for new parents,"OK, so maybe some folks who have been around babies a lot would already know all these rhymes & games, but we didn't, and our first child, now 17 months old, loves this book. She loves it enough that after checking it out from the library several times and memorizing the songs for ourselves, we're now regularly buying it as a baby shower gift. It's a nice way to spend some interactive time with little ones- I'd say 8 weeks to maybe 30 months old. Nice pictures; the games are: This Little Piggy, Slowly-Slowly, Jeremiah Blow the Fire (our favorite), Pat-a-Cake, Eye Winker, Trot Trot Trot, and Mix a Pancake. I would give this book 5 stars if it had maybe two (or three) more games/pages. But it is the standard length and price for a board book."
1,Disappointing,This book was VERY disappointing. Only several cardboard reinforced pages long...certainly NOT worth the price. Had very basic and well know 'baby games' so there was really nothing new. This is one of the disadvantages of ordering a book on-line - although generally I am quite satisfied.
3,My first baby games,"My 5 month old likes to look at the illustrations. The rhymes are fun to act out with my son, but there are only a handful and most I already knew. Nice book, but not best purchase if you're looking for a good array of games to play with your infant."
5,Super Cool Woverine,"This Wolverine toy is way cool and fun. He looks just like he does in X-Men 2. I bought this toy because I like Wolverine in the movies and my friend got one like it and it persuaded me to buy one. You can do a lot of stuff from the movies with this action figure. If you like X-Men or know someone who does, this is a must for you or them."
4,MEOW!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU EXTINGTION IS NOW MUTANT!,I got this toy from my aunt and it is great. But beware the claws come off easily thats the same thing with mine now I have to pretend they are there. His right leg is a little loose so it is hard to get used to him. he dos not look entirely like hugh jackman but a cross between van helsing so a little clunky a nice figure but not better than sauron.
5,Nice looking toy,"At first I didn't think this toy looked as good as the Wolverine toy from the original X-Men movie, but when I juxtaposed the two, I realized this toy's remarkable semblance of Hugh Jackman. It is also very poseable- ""super poseable"" even- allowing for a good looking display toy. The accessory is a bit pointless because they removed the Danger Room scene from X2, and it doesn't do anything except rotate Wolverine. The toy is good for its purpose, though. Pick it up if you're after X-Men toys."
3,Disappointing on the whole,"I could hardly believe that this was by the same author as the brilliant ""An instance of the fingerpost"". Admittedly, it's not the same kind of thing and it's an earlier work, but even so, it is mediocre as whodunnits go. The outcome was largely predictable, and the characters lacked dimension. The best thing I can find to say about it is that it is vastly superior to the art history mysteries of Derek Wilson."
4,Evolving,"The other reviews are right about political intrigue taking too much space in contrast to art history. However, I think the characters are evolved more in this book then any other, and the personal aspect of the three main characters are brought out more then in the first three books. I agree this is not the best book to start with, but it is still a good read and essential if you are going to invest in reading the whole series. Most importantly for me, it is still written with a ton of wit."
3,Not the best of the series,"I've been reading this series in order and have been enjoying it a lot - the main characters are quirky and amusing, the world of antique art buying, selling, and stealing is fascinating, and the plots are fun. But this one just seemed a bit ""off"". Maybe Iain Pears was having a bad day (or month or however long it takes to write these). I'm a big fan of Pears but the bleakness of the historical background and the fact that torture was central to the plot seemed dissonant to the usual light-heartedness of the series. I also started to get irritated that Jonathan and Flavia never had enough money. Don't they have credit cards? Oh well, I'm going to continue through the series. I'm still a fan."
2,ho-hum,"I had higher expectations for this book - ""art history"" mystery, set in Europe (Paris, Rome), etc. It turned out to be a run-of-the-mill crime story, with unconvincing characters. Not much (should I say - nothing?) to do with art, or art history. Yeah, there is a picture, but it plays a minimal role in the book. That scene at the end, drawing parallels to the paiting, is so crude, I'd rather not have it there. In general, Pears is rather heavy handed as a writer (at least in this book, I have not read anything else by him). No finesse... The book is still a decent mystery. It is just not very exciting. If you are looking for a mystery with a european setting - look somewhere else. You can replace ""Rome"" or ""Paris"" in this book with... Berlin? Chicago? and you won't even notice that these names were not there from the very beginning.I see people commenting that there are better books in this series - I hope so, but I may know now why my local bookstores do not carry this series at all."
5,60 garage pop meets tasty 90's british girlpunk. A Gem!,"And they cover 'Pinhead'... Hard to find their stuff in the states, but they ARE worth it."
4,Gleason travels down a new road,"Every Road by Michael Gleason is a pleasing and addictive power pop departure.I heard a random song not long ago called ""Maybe I Dont Know"" and immediately declared it the best song Id heard this year. Soon after, I found out it was by Michael Gleason and was incredulous. Being only familiar with Gleason as a member of the 80s CCM group AD, I was shocked to discover that this music, this very voice, belonged to him. I acquired the CD and found it to be consistantly good, but not quite up to the level of the first song Id heard. I found it to be sneakily addictive however. The production is pristine and top notch musicianship abounds throughout. To compare, Id liken it to a less eclectic and more positive Kevin Gilbert with strong vocals and very naked processing. Truly a breath of fresh air in a very, VERY stale and decidedly underproduced current pop music world!"
5,See! your foes,"As a ninja, I often attack and kill my foes while blanketed in the dark stillness of night. I find this type of setting indubitably complements my cunning and stealthy moves rather well. However, as I would often administer a final death blow with my katana blades, and hear my adversaries lungs being vanquished of their final breaths, I felt as if something was missing. I realized I hungered to look into my oppugnant's eyes at the moment his soul was drained from his inferior body. This is where the 18"" Ninja Sword with LED Light Sharp comes into play. Now as I plunge this reliable instrument of death into an enemie's flesh I can click on the LED light on and get a glimpse of the whole scene. I was so impressed with the weapon that I recently bought several as Christmas gifts for some of the younger ninjas as well as my wife and our toddler ninja sons. Extra kudos for the long battery life as well. A must buy!"
2,BE WARNED!!!!,"If you order this sword, you may not get what you see. Yes you will get the same 'style' of sword, but as for the look, forget it, the steel is pure black. Now if that's what you want great, I personally wanted the 'silver' steel look, but got the 'jet black' steel. Don't worry, it was the same sword, just a different color."
4,Nice Ninja Weapon,"It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says ""we ship black if we are out of silver"". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him."
2,Blah,"You get what you pay for... This does not cost a lot of money at all. So if you want to just throw it behind glass and never let anyone get near it. Maybe it's for you, but it's pretty weak to me."
1,The heck...?,"If I may ask.. why.. why would anyone need an LED on a sword? Gonna go hunting with it at night? Fight off the 'forces of evil' in your mind? I'm sorry.. but the idea of that seems rather odd to me. Perhaps others can find a use for it? The blade might be good, I wouldn't know as I do not own this item."
1,very dissapointing,"This tape was very dissapointing in that it had very little information regarding his system. it was only a copy of three of the Golf Channel's half hour shows, which i had already seen."
1,What rubbish!,"If one WANTS to find connections and similarites between cultures of course they will be found, but this is taking things too far. To suggest that the Japanese people (who arrived on the Japanese continent from Korea) are somehow related to an European-biblical-fictional-tribe is, to me anyhow, quite ridiculous. According to the research carried out by the National Geographic DNA ancestry Project (Genographic Project) there is no connection with Hebrew peoples and Japanese peoples. This research is closing the gaps of what science knows today about humankind's ancient ""migration stories.""A poor attempt to connect the fictions of the Christian god-cult with other unrelated cultures and peoples. Now, I have to go and send an e-mail to Santa Claus for this years Wish List."
3,Solid theory,"Needing some more knowlege for a project I grabbed this,and left my mind reeling. University level stuff I suspect."
1,Not Worth It,I would not recommend purchasing this. It is a total waste of money. The necessary information is available elswhere without a price tag. I feel totally ripped off.
4,This band is one of my personal favorites!,"Sugar Ray is a very good band, and I think Every Day was their best song! The only reason I rated them a 4star was because I couldn't understand what they were saying. Otherwise it is a realy awesome song and they are a very good band!"
4,Cute design,I really liked the design on this set. Others were very boy oriented and didn't fit my daughters room. My daughter loves having spongebob and patrick to keep her company at night. I was surprised that the comforter was more like a quilt than a traditional comforter. Overall I was happy with the purchase.
5,"""Crescent wrench set"".......how's that for a title?","Just got these in. Took about 4 days from order button to on my door step. I've only looked them over but haven't used them yet, so 4 stars. I'll report back (good or bad) after I use them a little.-Ok, it's been a few weeks since they came in and I've used them a couple of times. Not much really exciting to say about about a set of crescent wrenches, BUT these are actually fairly well made. Not much slop in the fit of the jaw and they do have a nice touch as far as having both english and metric scales laser-engraved on the sides so that you can tell what size of bolt or whatever it is you're working on. The rubberized grips are nice too when working around oils. I'll give them 5 stars because they are what they are for the money."
4,COULD be better,"I own this game and REALLY like it. But some times the bosses can get really anoying and then you get a game over, and have to restart the level. But this makes it so when you finally beat the boss you fell like celebrating!"
4,You can play as Bass?!,"Bass?! Sweet! In the other Megaman games that I have, Bass is so hard to beat. Now I might get to kick bootie with him!"
5,Megaman's games are getting better every time,"I've tried to get this game ever since it came out and finally got it for 8$ and trust me,it was worth the wait.I'm a serious megaman fan and a game master,but i've had this game for 3 months and I still havn't beat it.I like the fact that you can play with bass.He's really good.My ratings:sound-8graphics-8.5action-8.8bosses-9.9overall8.9"
3,Megaman and Bass Difficulty and Polish Problems..,"Megaman and Bass is an excellent example of an old-school game.One thing you might notice about this title is that it is very difficult. This WILL pass partially, as you will get better(it took me 3 weeks to get to the final boss the first time i played it, about 2 days later on), but this is still a difficult game. It also lacks the polish of many modern-day games, even megaman games, which have always had this rough feel. But, if you want megaman action, such as megaman X, you may want to try this game out. But, I feel they had a strange balance between bass and megaman, and perhaps you're better off with Megaman Zero. Nonetheless, this game is fun even though it is limited and pretty challenging."
2,EGR brand is much better quality,"[ 4-piece set for 2005 Ford Freestyle]I've bought many sets of AVS visors over the years. Their quality has definitely gone down hill! The tint color is unattractive. The edges were not finished well. The surface had scuff-marks. And it took three sets to get one that didn't have a cracked visor, right out of the box!Fortunately, Lund International's customer Service is Superb! I guess they NEED to be.I ordered a set of EGR visors for my Nissan Titan at the same time. They were beautiful. At least twice the thickness as the AVS (where needed), no scuff-marks, smooth edges, installed in a couple minutes. Cost about $6 more! Nuff said!"
2,Not as described,"This is listed as photo quality paper. It is not. It is a heavier grade of inkjet paper with a decent brightness rating, but it does not produce photo quality prints. Whether glossy or matte, as this item is listed, photo paper implies a certain level of color and resolution; the print I made as a test run has the ""washed"" appearance and lacks vibrance in the colors, typical of general use printer paper. It is a nice quality paper for printing more durable documents for presentations (as it states) but I needed photo paper. If you want good, photo quality prints: try the Inkpress brand of photo luster paper; it is much more expensive, but produces the results you would be looking for."
2,This is NOT Photo Paper!,"This is not Photo Paper. As a matter of fact on the package I got it says:""Presentation Paper Matte Formerly Photo Quality Paper"" It's about as thick as regular paper and has no gloss. Only thing I can think of is that is a little bit better quality than regular paper."
1,Not cardstock,"I discovered the brilliance of Epson Presentation Paper a few years ago when printing wedding programs for my brother and his bride. Truly, the coated paper makes a difference in the final product versus regular cardstock. However, for this particular project I needed a legal sized sheet, and thought I was buying a heavier coated cardstock as I typically do. I was mistaken. This paper is super thin - it almost seems thinner than regular copy paper even. Perhaps they product description listed the paper's weight, but I'll be honest, I was so focused on the size of the paper I neglected to pay attention to the weight. So do not buy if you are looking for a cardstock thickness. Buy Epson's Premium or Ultra Premium paper..."
4,okay for photos,"This photo paper is okay for photos, but I'd rather get glossy paper then matte. If you can't find legal size for glossy then go for this, is still works although it may not have the great look of a glossy paper. The quality still looks real good but not that great."
1,Terrible inconvenience!,"This is the exact opposite of what I had intended to order. This paper comes with a matte finish, even though the web site claims to that it has a glossy, ""photo-quality"" finish. I am extremely disappointed. I am having to extend a few deadlines because of this error."
5,The Best,I am a born and raised Texan and have been eating ranch style beans my whole life. The are the best in home made baked beans and chili or on their own. I now live and in NY and can't find these yummy beans anywhere but Amazon. I highly recommend these!!
1,Changed the recipe,"I have been eating these for thirty years and for the last year or two the taste, color, and texture of these are not up to the old standard. Too bad. One more example of a fine product sold to a food conglomerate and being cheapened until they are not worth the bother..."
1,It took almost 20 minutes to open the can!,"Why should it be so difficult to open a can. I use a can opener which does not cut the lid, it ""derims"" the lid from the can, thus leaving no sharp cutting edges.I tried to open both ends of the can and couldn't pull the lid free. I had to use two different kinds of pliers to finally pull the lid off the can, which happened to be the bottom end of the can. There was almost an inch of goop in the bottom before getting to the beans. Needless to say, being that the beans are in liquid, it didn't leave much beans left for my recipe. (I used the beans to make a bean salad.) I expected the beans to be black but they are not.I doubt seriously that I will buy that brand of ""black"" beans again."
2,"Nice fantasy, BUT...","I read the first 4 books in William Horwood's Duncton series... He's a very captivating writer, his plots are extremely good, BUT I have a major problem with the way in which he shoots down the Bible and places his own mole religion in its place - a mere twisted derivation of the Gospel. If he had to drag religion into it, couldn't he at least have invented his own instead of degrading Christ? Because of this I didn't finish the rest of his books. Christians beware - it may be an excellent read, BUT his rather inexcusable blasphemy would likely put you off too."
1,Really Awful,"Chris is a great man, but this book is a real piece. I expected to be inspired to make games, but all I was inspired to do was stop reading. Don't read, or even look at this book."
3,Get the maxi-single...,"For a few dollars more, you can get the 'Soldier' maxi-single with 3 additional remixes. Here's the track listing for this cd-single:1. Soldier (Album version)2. Soldier (Grizz Blackmarket Remix)"
3,Its NO Great,"Depeche Mode is my all time favorite band, but their most recent recordings from this album on have been a allot weaker compared to the 5 albums before this. I think the band has suffred allot from Alan leaving the band. It may sound strange to some, but I look more forward to his next solo album under the ""Recoil"" name than the next Mode record. Maybe the guys are just losing their edge as they get older. Don't get me wrong the album has 3 awesome tracks Barrel of a gun, Home, and Freestate...."
3,Just Short of Being Great,"If there was ever a soundtrack released to accompany David Gahan's fall into the abyss and subsequent slow recovery, this is it. Tracks like 'Barrel of a Gun', 'Useless', 'Sister of Night' and 'The Bottom Line' effectively narrate Gahan's trials and tribulations in the last 2 years. Although the stadium-sized rock loops of SOngs of Faith and Devotion have been eschewed for simpler synth patterns, this is also Depeche Mode's most musically-varied album , with touches of blues, country, gospel, industrial and trip-hop worked carefully into the seam of their musical essence. Getting Tim Simenon in seems to have switched the band to a new direction, the result being a leaner and more austere sound. Could've been better without the inclusions of the space-wasting instrumentals though. 'Ultra' stops short of being a definitive Depeche Mode record, but it works well as a transitory album from the last few albums to future projects."
4,Not bad for such a long shot,"David Gahan kind of solved his problems, and DM had finnally put together Ultra. Pretty good. Not the best one (Violator is for me the apotheose of DM's music) but ""It's no Good"" and ""Barell of a Gun"" value the album just by themselves.."
4,A Strong Comeback,"DM certainly went through a dangerous hiatus... but they returned with form and style. This album shuffles amid powerful, affecting ballads, and 'punch-in-the-face' laments, always written over Martin's superb minor-chord styling and pop sensibility. A definite must-have for any Devotee."
4,A return home,"I have been a devoted DM fan for years now. Their dark, apocalyptic lyrics and rythms dig deeper into the souls of music listeners the world round than any other artist I've ever heard. This album is no different and actually I would if I could give it 4.5 stars (The only album I gave 5 stars is DM, Songs of faith and Devotion). Both the lyrics and the music itself is captivating and intense. If you enjoy this type of genre -who wouldn't... Then go out, and buy it!"
5,One of their best.,"Ultra was for Depeche mode a new begining, coming out of some personal troubles, Gahan attempting suicide, Wilder leaving.maybe the people related closer to this album than others because the lyrics seems more personal and darker. But their was definatley an undercurrent message of hope in this album. It's one of those albums I will defend because it is so personal, coming thru the dark spots in life and still having that anger but beating surviving it. I appreciated this album for the lyrics and music, but also because DM survived their demons.Cheers."
5,DM : with real instruments,"Gore and the boys have really stepped it up a notch with this release. A focused effort, beautifully engineered and infinitely listenable. You'll want to store this one in the car, it's a great soundtrack to any subversive road ""trips"" you'll want to take."
4,YES!,"For those that don't think this album is Depeche Mode, listen again. I mean listen! It's by far the most emotional and deep album they've released. Though Alan has departed, the production doesn't lack and the compositions tear at your heart. If you know anything about what they've been through over the years, you'll understand this album. The instumentals are the least appealing to me but with 'Home', 'Useless', 'It's No Good', 'Barrel Of A Gun', Sister Of Night' and 'Freestate'(my favorite) there's enough here to make it interesting for any listener."
4,Haunting & Elegant at the same time,"I love this CD. I listen to it a lot, even 10-12 years later. The sounds and melodies are very simple, but melodic. Most importantly, they groove. The whole groove of this cd makes you relax and almost melt into a euphoric & heavily relaxed state of conscious without losing its cool.Another interesting fact about this album is that they hire Living Colour/Tackhead bassist, Doug Wimbish to lay down the bass lines. He adds a groove and ambient element to this cd that has never been captured by any other Depeche Mode cd...before or after. I wish they would hire him again for their next cd."
2,Useless,"Except for Barrel Of A Gun, It's No Good, Useless and Sister Of The Night, the rest of the album is boring filler which shows that after four years since their last album that they didn't put much effort into this one. The songs are very complacent, unoriginal and lacks any energy. Have they become afraid of a dance beat? Through the 80s and ending with Violator, Depeche Mode had great dance/synthesizer songs which is why they got so popular. They were very unique sounding but all of that uniqueness is missing. I hope their new album ""Exciter"" brings back some creativity."
2,Their worst.,"This should have been an e.p. There are insturmental fillers that are boring and songs that do not remain in the ear after listening. Barrel Og A Gun, The Love Thieves and It's No Good are fanastic! Otherwise, just a trial to listen to it!"
2,GET ALAN WILDER BACK!!!!,This CD sounds like dark elavator music. The songs are boring and aren't as catchy or creative as ones on past albums. I can't believe that the band that made Personal Jesus made this. The group needs Alan. David Gahan is the singer and head pretty boy. Marti Gore writes the lyrics and Andrew Fletcher is just some looser that hangs around with them. Alan was the very fabric of the band; he was their most talented muscian. This cd is missing something that their past cds had.
3,a schizophrenic album,"Half of this album is very good, a mixture of dark, sublime sounds, good lyrics, and haunting tableaux. This half consists of The Love Thieves, Home, Sister of Night, Freestate, The Bottom Line, and Insight. Each of these songs is an arresting vignette- Sister of Night sounds like a post-apocalyptic search for warmth in the arms of another, while The Love Thieves embellishes the daily struggle to make something of one's self.However, the other half is either filler (two instrumental tracks, three if you count the hidden track at the end?), or leftover refuse from Songs of Faith and Devotion. What is Barrel of a Gun, if not a reprise of I Feel You? Useless is okay, but the single version reins in a bit that fuzzy, garage-band guitar riff that agitates. And It's No Good, which isn't Songs of Faith and Devotion leftover, is just a reprise of their late-eighties sound.Program the first set of songs I mentioned, and you have a spectacular album. Forget about the rest."
4,Excellent Album,"I'm a big fan of the Ultra album. I stopped listening to Depeche a year or so after Violator (which is actually probably my favorite album of them all), but I started listening again when Ultra came out. It's typical Depeche Mode. By that, I don't mean that it sounds exactly like anything from the previous albums. I mean that this cd contains tracks with varying tempo, sound, emotion, etc. Each track is great in it's own way. I'm particularly fond of Barrel of a Gun, Home, It's no good (great video, by the way), Uselesss, and Sister of night."
5,"For a first time ""Depeche Mode"" listener...","While some have rated this CD as having less energy than their previous music, I can only say that I have enjoyed this CD immensely.Yes, the music is very toned down, but this is also the first CD of Depeche Mode I'd ever bought.. I fell in love with this Depeche Mode. The excellent vocals mixed with the electronic effects produce a very ""emotional"" feel to the music.This isn't music you hop around to, this isn't music you would exercise to, this is music you would ""feel"".. similar to other soft techno, it's great background music as well.With no preconceptions of their type of music, I have found this to be an excellent CD."
5,Another masterpiece,This is one of the best. Nothing to add. A great great Depeche Mode album. I feel it close to Violator and Playing the angel.
2,Poor...,"It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!"
3,"When Alan left, it fell apart....","When Alan Wilder left DM, that huge gaping hole could never be closed. As DM continued on as a trio, the songs on this album show that Alan's influence in the design of the beats was severly missed. The only worthy song on this whole CD was Its no Good. Everything else was not DM worthy..."
2,It used to be better,"I don't like the way DM changed. This album has a few good songs, like ""It's no good"". However, there are some that I can't listen at all."
2,Obvious That The Guys In The Studio Really Write This Stuff,"It's sad when great studio production is relied upon to help songs that would sound crappy if they were recorded years ago. This recording relies too much on the high tech recording process and not enough on the quality of the songs. All of those people who are giving this CD five stars are probably Depeche Mode fans who have trouble being objective. I think that five stars is a bit much especially compared with some of their earlier stuff. Depeche Mode seems to suffer from the ""few good songs mixed in with a lot of boring filler"" syndrome. I'm so sick and tired of buying CDs with one or two good tunes and a whole host of crappy numbers. That sort of sums up much of Depeche Mode's discography including Ultra."
3,Could have been better,"Depeche Mode has always given me a feeling of exitement, especially when a new album was released. This time, however, i had no such thrills. Just a good album, but nothing special. Although almost every song is ok none of the songs really lift me up. For example: a song like 'Home' seems to be a killer at first hearing, but it soon wears out. I don't know about this one ..."
4,Exactly As Advertised (Part A),"I've been coveting this book for a while but was put off by the price. When I stumbled on it advertised for almost half the list price in the Amazon Marketplace I was ready to purchase. I then wondered if it was too good to be true. The description was in ""as new condition"" but who knew what that actually meant and since this is a reference book, I didn't want coffee stains on pages. But my excitement about owning them won out and I decided to purchase the book. They arrived well before the estimated arrival date which was a nice surprise but the really big surprise was that the book was immaculate. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. I also bought Part B which was also in excellent condition."
4,If only there were a better way to buy ants..............,"We purchased this ant farm a few months ago. It is really cute. It has a skate park, street luge and bicycle park. It also has two built in magnifying glasses. The ants have alot of room to roam. We did not have any problems with the ants escaping. You just have to be sure to follow the instructions for putting it together correctly. It did take a couple of months for the ants to arrive which took away from the initial excitement when we purchased this toy and some of the ants were dead when they arrived (we live in Ohio and they were shipped from California). Our ants lived for a few months but now they are all gone. We don't really want to order more from this company and wait two more months. This is an eternity to the kids. It would be nice if there were an easier way to get the ants. Also you have to order the kit which includes ants, food, dropper for water, instruction booklet and poster of the ants anatomy."
3,"Great for adults, good for older kids","First of all, I've ordered ants several times. The warning label does say they can bite but they are not fire ants - the fiece ones from the South. Not all red ants are fire ants. (Check your ant encyclopedia.) All ants can bite apparently, and it's just a warning so you don't handle them too much and Uncle Milty covers himself liability-wise. I've never been bitten by any ant, and I've handled hundreds as a child and an adult....Second, think about it...how could ants live in a box on a shelf in a toy store for months and months? Of course you have to order them. However, who wouldn't be disappointed to find they don't ship ants in cold months, and, it should be on the box somewhere that this is true...it would save kids disappointment. It makes sense, once you find this out, of course, but a little explanation goes a long way.Third, the ant farm, if you follow directions, works really well, but I find the little one too confining, so I string two together...."
3,Very Interesting,Got it for Christmas and ordered the ants ... just got them through the mail....just in time for Easter! Set them up and can't believe the tunnels they've built. I am now busy watching them build another tunnel. I highly recommend this toy.
3,omg,i was like 12 when my dad got me this.....it sucks!! if even if u follow tha instructions...u end up w/ dead ants. ther get stuck in the sand and die. . .get a real pet.Sea monkys are even better!!
2,BEWARE: This software is now available for free,"As of last year, DAZ 3D, the company which develops the Bryce software, has offered Bryce 5.5 online as a free download. There is no need to buy the software unless you are particularly interested in having the CD/retail box, or if you want the newer version (Bryce 6.1 as of this posting, which should be purchased directly from DAZ's website). This item is not even the newest version.If you would like to download Bryce 5.5, search for it on Cnet's download.comAt any rate, it's great software for the beginner 3D artist, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to make quick and simple 3D models."
3,Shines on,"3 1/2These introspective adventurers can become mired in their own atmospheric minutia occasionally, but by and large the disc remains a focused affair of synergistic sophistication."
4,recommendation for the cover,"I plan on getting one of these covers but since it is a tight fit, would it adviseable to lubricate the grummet before installing it?"
1,ANT5135D-R Performance,"After receiving these three 5GHz black antennas, I took them to a UL lab measuring their performance, it turned out very disappointed, mainly because they show very poor efficiency.At 5180 MHz, the radiation efficiency is only 50%, and it drops to 36% at 5500 MHz and a mere 28% at 5800 MHz.A comparable antenna from other vendor achieves 75% across the entire 5GHz band."
2,The picture is misleading.,"Don't pay attention to the picture, it's misleading. You ONLY get one antenna with this product. However, the antenna does work as listed."
5,"Vampires, and Priests, and Transvestites, OH MY!","Little Girl Blue is a GREAT novel! Maybe one of the best I've read in a long time. It's about a teenage girl who would rather be dead than face her problems, mostly the result of her mother's death and being seduced by a charming yet evil black transvestite in New Orleans who promises to make her a woman and a star. This novel takes all the cliches of horror stories and turns them inside out and on their head in an attempt to really find out why evil seems so alluring, and so benign to a generation of people who no longer quite believe in it. Evil is real, believe me. I work in a prison psyche ward and should know. In the acknowledgements, author van Heuklom writes that he has encountered demons. Normally, I might dismiss this as propaganda to sell books, but after reading this novel I am totally convinced that he knows what he's talking about. Anyone who has ever considered suicide NEEDS to read this book."
1,Worked for a week,"This must have been a fake, otherwise I can't explain how it stopped working a week after installed in my cell phone."
1,"Unless your a collector, don't buy it","So I bought this CD because I hadn't heard any of the songs on it, expecting the sound to be aleast decent, because it's digitally remastered. Well it isn't, and the sound is ... and I want my [money]back. You can't hear any of the lyrics. Unless you're a Beatles collector and enjoy hearing bad tapings of the Beatles, don't waste you're money on it."
2,"Good songs, but HORRIBLE sound quality","Yes, I know it is The Beatles live, and it's my opinion that The Beatles are the greatest band of all time and that no one else can even come close to how good The Beatles were, but seriously, how can you enjoy this? All you can hear is the drums and the lead guitar. The bass, rhythm guitar, and vocals are most of the time, inaudible. The lead guitar has that screeching, bad-quality sound that is common to most live recordings. This is definitely my least favorite of all Beatles releases. I know it's a part of history, it's The Beatles in Hamburg, blah, blah, blah....But the live recordings on the Anthology albums are SO much better."
1,Zero Stars in truth,"Save your money, this was recorded on a small portable tape recorder that was being carried around the room. The Beatles were unable to block this release in 1977, and issued Live At The Hollywoodbowl to counter it. This is not really essential listening. Please save your money."
2,Only for the Die Hard Beatles fan who has everything.,"This would be a great CD if the sound quality was any good. If you really want to hear the Beatles at this period in there career, I would suggest ""Anthology One"". I'm only giving this disc two stars because it's The Beatles."
2,Hasn't anyone else noticed what the real problem is here?,"First, the good news: In my opinion, digital remastering has made it far easier to hear the lyrics this time around. But now, the bad news: Although there would have been more than enough room on this CD to avoid doing so, at least two of the songs listed here (""A Taste of Honey"" and ""Besame Mucho,"" the second of which has never appeared on any other Star Club CD reissue) suffer from a butcher's hand in the editing process. Why??????? I suddenly feel very sorry that I parted with my copy of the original European vinyl album years ago...!"
3,"Good songs, not so great quality.","When you look at the Beatles, and you think of all the problems they went through in 1962 -- playing for 8 hours every night at Hamburg, Pete Best, the first but not-so-good drummer, taking drugs -- after looking at all that, you think to yourself, ""How could they do something this good?"" These are good songs, not so great quality. In fact, on some tracks you can't hear the words. Also, 10 of these songs appear on LPs in the following 3 years, which tells you that clear, clean, crisp studio versions can be found. However, Hamburg started the Beatles, so for historical purposes, it's a good CD to have."
5,THE BEATLES' LAST NIGHT IN HAMBURG,"FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT ""1962 LIVE AT THE STAR CLUB IN HAMBURG"" I WANTED IT SO BAD, BUT I COULD'NT FIND IT. THE BEST I COULD FIND WAS THIS ON(WICH IS CLOSE). I WOUNDERED WHAT IT WOULD SOUND LIKE, IT WAS COOL TO HEAR THE BEATLES(BEFORE THE DAYS OF BEATLEMANIA).IF YOU ARE A COLLECTOR OF THE BEATLES, OR OF HISTORICAL ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC: BUY THIS.IT COMES WITH A POSTER INSIDE TOO!!!!THIS IS A 5 STAR RATING FOR SURE"
3,I want more !,"The book only scrathes the surface of this splendid director. Several chapters on the directors movies are simply to ""thin"". There's no information that we haven't heard of before. Instead read the book on GEORGE LUCAS by same auther. It's much better."
4,O fata cu probleme,The heroine of the story is coming to terms with her own understanding of adulthood in a vile and destructive society. She had been brought up to distrust everyone and was trying to work out who she could have as a friend. Unfortunately she chooses the wrong person. The fear that everyone in Romania felt under the dictator Ceausescu is well shown in this book. It was a period when even a bar of chocolate was seen as a luxury. Children in the UK and in the US will find it hard to believe much of the story because it is so difficult to imagine not having videos and good music and burgers and milkshakes. Remember the orphans of Romania. Their lives were literally horrific. It was better for the children at home with their parents but not that much better. A good book with a slightly unexpected ending. I wonder did they live happily ever after?
5,This a great peice of Historical fiction....................,"This was great suspenseful novel. Romania's troubles were so clear and the character developement was outstanding, the way Flora begins the bookas a child and ends the book as an adult."
5,The John Woo zombie gun opera KEEPS ON ROCKING!!,"This series just keeps getting better and better....Grave gunslings even better than Chow-yun Fat in a John Woo movie,and the drama keeps getting better...we get two good fights in this volume,the first being our Bad boy Grave dispatching a hord of orgmen then onward to an exciting train battle against Balladbird Lee,who despite being cool,demonstrates he can also be quite the Jackass...trust me,you'll be glad he got killed...the next big fight is a climactic sword vs. gun as Grave battles his former master,Bear Walken,in an honorable duel to the death....bear reveals that he has been aching in his heart for betraying Big daddy,but we get to the reason why he didn't kill Harry...Bear proves that he is the most honorable and coolest of the Top 4,and this sets the stage for Grave's final battle against Millenion...Justice comes in hot smokin' lead..."
1,Not nearly as interesting as it sounds,"I had high hopes for using this program in my high school astronomy classes. All of the other PBS videos I have tried have been useful and high quality. This program seemed extremely disjointed. It had far more CGI imagery than useful content, and the content did not follow any sort of a clear or logical narrative sequence. I suggest passing this one up."
5,Mother and Child,"This book is one that everyone connected to adoption should read. It is a well written account of what happened back in the baby scope era. It tells the story of a mother who gave her first born child up for adoption and her search for her.Susan also lost a child to cancer, just when she was starting her search for her child. It is co written by Joanne, who is the daughter Susan searched for.You girls did a great job. It gives other mothers hope and encouragement.Glad this is available for Kindle."
5,A wonderful book that tugs at your heartstrings,"The Same Smile is one of my most cherished books. I have an autographed copy by Susan Mello Souza and the night I got the book I read it cover to cover. It is written straight from the heart and touches the heart that reads it. I cannot imagine the strength that Susan maintained after losing two daughters. As one reads, one is lifted to the limits of joy and dropped into the pit of Hell. I especially enjoyed the writing of JoAnne with Susan in the end. I highly recommend this outstanding book to any adoptees, birthmothers, or those who feel they could use some good education in both areas. This book is truly a 5 star book with heart."
4,The Same Smile,"This is a tale of a mother's search for the daughter she gave up when she was a teenager. It relates a poignant journey, filled with setbacks and heart breaking moments evolving into a wonderful story with a happy fulfilling ending. A highly recommeded read.Ina Coggeshall"
5,"Moving, excellent",I am an adopted person who is in a reunion with my mother I lost to adoption as an infant. So I can relate to so much in the book. I highly recommend the book. I have had the priveledge of meeting the author - she is a very strong & sweet lady - her book is true to her.
4,Love Is in the Earth: Kaleidoscopic Pictorial Supplement Z,"This book was very informative as well as interesting. Well written and the pictorials were excellent. If you'e interested in this subject,I highly recommend it."
5,Love is the earth,This book is amazing. The information is well organized and it is very informative. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in metaphysics.
2,A Great Dissappointment,"I purchased this book primarily not only for the metaphysical properties, but the pictures and identification. I consider the scanned pictures worthless for use in identification, they are for the most part, flat (no depth of field), dull (poor color rendition),and appear slightly blurry and lifeless. In looking up minerals I had a working knowledge off, either through lapidary, collecting myself, or dealing directly with miners, or mine owners, I found several inconsistencies which lead me to doubt the information of minerals I am looking up and have no knowledge of. The glossy paper the book is printed on, is another negative, through past experience skin oils and field use will decrease its readability greatly over time. Metaphysically, I can make no comments as it is still a subject beyond my ken, but I am learning."
4,Good coming of age and coming out story,"The main character is a bit overplayed, causing a little disbelief on my part in watching that his homophobic best friend wouldn't suspect his buddy might have a crush on him, despite mutual masturbatory scenes and homoerotic moments. But youngsters could be this way in Germany, I suppose, without causing a lot of suspicion. Lots of fun and some soul searching going on, and I enjoyed the movie. It is in German and subtitled in English (and others, I think) if that makes any difference. I prefer the original language over dubbed audio anyway."
4,Good coming to age gay film,"Despite the same gay cliches found in almost every gay movie, summer storm is a well balanced coming to age gay movie, that nourishes your mind with a cozy happy ending."
4,Charming.,"I can't understand German and English so much. Because I'm Japanese girl. However,I like gay movie. The scene in the lake side was the most beautiful sex scene that I had seen so far. I decided purchase because I had seen the scene with YouTube. Especially Marlon Kittel is so cute!!!!!Actually, the music and the image are very beautiful overall.Tobi loves Achim, but Achim is a straight and has a girlfriend.Tobi must behave as a straight, and suffers. I was painful when I consider his feelings. Openly gay boat team ""Queerstroker"" came to the same campground.By their appearance,various problems occur between Tobi and his friends.I have not understood details.But finally, I thought he had decided it to living as a gay. It's wonderful that he accepts it.And It seems like ""Queerstroker"" was very honest and lovely. It's not possible to write any further well. sorry..."
5,Summer Storm,"I first saw a trailer of this movie on You Tube. I wasn't disappointed when I received my own copy of the film. This is a touching story of two childhood friends that experience a wonderful and loving bond of best friendship. The twist is Tobi's love is deeper than friendship for Achim. The feelings are not mutual however. The frustrations they both experience almost breaks their friendship apart. In the end, their friendship survives."
2,Do German teenagers really talk like that?,"German is my mother language, which in this case is unfortunate because I couldn't help but understand the horribly wooden dialogues. No German I've ever known talks like that. But I moved to the States at the tender age of 38 seven years ago. Maybe I'm too old and/or have been away from Germany too long."
4,Beautiful,"I loved this movie, it was beautifully played with beautiful actors and beautiful set. It's a must see picture."
3,Meh,It was okay but the concept had so much more potential and it failed to live up up to what it could have been. I was satisfied with the movie but I'm never going to list it as one of my most recommended gay films.
4,Moving and Enchanting,"I found this film both moving in its humor and in the way the actors conveyed the emotions of the teenagers, and enchanting in the way the story was told. The acting was very good; I found all the characters believable and the touch of humor at the end with the ""homophobe"" was very funny; the coach was obviously smarter than his kids thought (which is typically the case). Not living in Germany, I can't say how accurate the cultural items were, but they were beievable, and the way the actors sensitively portrayed the individuals was very well done. The lead and his best friend, Achim, and the girlfriend were portrayed well. And, for those of us who've been there, the scene on the boat dock was lovely (the entire scene, not just two boys). I rate the film very highly; it was very enjoyable, touching, and hopeful. The ending, as I said was humorous but also filled with promise. I would have give it 4.5 stars but that wasn't a possibility."
3,Summer storm's decent,"I thought it was a decent movie. Had your cliche stereotypes of gays being flamboyant and about guys just wanting sex etc.. what I did like was the honest portrayal of the main character's confusion and struggle to come out to his peers. It had it's funny moments and it's sympathetic ones as well. It was a good teenage coming out movie, the best way to put it."
4,Ja gut,"I think it was a very interesting movie to watch, and to see the struggle one has in young life, especially one that is gay and trying to come out and scared of what might happen. Also the movie has some good humor along the way. I enjoyed this movie very much!"
3,Artistic and Cute,"The movie was professionally done, but all in all, it's not that different from most other gay movies out there. Still good though, and definitely worth watching."
5,a really really really fun game,"It is true. This game has a ton of programming flaws. I can't count the times that my saved data has been deleted. Infact, it's happened so many times that I don't even try to complete any of the street puzzles anymore. As well, there's a lot of game play issues, like gems jumping straight to the bottom, even though this is very rare, and the multi play is littered with problems. But, in spite of all these problems, I still love this game. the learning curve is HUGE, and I've played almost every day since the title came out and it's still challenging. Anyone looking for a challenge? You'll find it right here, and believe me, you won't be disapointed."
2,Not As I Remembered,This game is just a glorified Tetris. Not as much fun as I remember and quite boring. Thank goodness for SIMS.
4,totaly awesome game my fav!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"super puzzle fighter 2 turbo is one of the best games of all time!!!!!!!! but make sure you get it on playstation, much better gameplay and effects"
4,A fine game,"Granted, it's a tough call between ""Super Puzzle Fighter II"" and its predecessor's GBA incarnation, ""Puyo Pop."" But I'll take Chun Li kicking at Ryu while I hurry to connect color-coded gems any day of the week. The sound is terrific, the graphics are blocky but gorgeous, and the gameplay is out of this world. Two cartridge ""versus"" mode is outlandish fun. Seeing little gems crash and explode somehow gives me such a sense of satisfaction, even when I'm losing."
4,A wonderfully touching story of human emotion,"Shorter than your average novel, Any Time Now does not disappoint despite its slender size. The male author writes from a woman's point of view with rare insight and caps this off with warm and believable characters all the way through.With time travel a central feature of the story this book could easily have become bogged down with technical details but this does not happen and the human element remains very much at the centre of the tale all the time.There are some nice touches of humour, which counterpoint the moments that make you sad or just make you sigh in sympathy. Every now and then a sparkling piece of prose causes you to stop, re-read just for the joy of it, and bring to mind truly beautiful images.Although perhaps the 'bad guys' could be construed as a little stereotypical this does not detract from the story and the end of the tale leaves you feeling glad and happy that you made the journey."
1,A joke!,"I Bought this tittle, thinking in the great BBC's ""Classic Albums"" Series, but it's a total fake.All the footage is a crappy vcd sourced, with a bunch of nobodys talking. And, oh yes, Izzy Stradlin appear... at least his voice.Very sad."
1,Not what it says,"dont buy, the footage is very averege, izzy stradlin does not say one word, the three people talking about the album and band seeem to think they know the band personally....which they dont..and they speculate on who broke guns and roses up and one guy blames slash...best wait till a authorised version comes out...but in general.DONT BUY"
3,"great footage from ""live at the ritz '88""","While I'n not that wild about the concept of this dvd, it's got some great excerpts of ""the gunners"" from ""live at the Ritz '88"" which is an awsome show. Even though the footage isn't up to the video standards of the nineties, the energy of the show warrants a dvd release in itself. If Geffen owns the rights to that show, they should release it proper, maybe with a little tweaking here and there it could be brought up to decent levels. Also my copy of the dvd has a glitch in the St. Louise footage where Axl jumps into the crowd, could this be the work of Mr. Rose trying to keep an embarrassing moment from view?"
3,The first story was great,"I didn't find most of the stories inspiring, unfortunately, but this book is worth reading for Jo Goodman's Baby Dream. It starts with a mystery, the heroine was very likeable, and it ended with a twist. More attention could have been placed on the actual development of the romance but it's an anthology so I suppose there just wasn't space.Benedict's Where Dreams come True is OK, but the others.. were just unbelievable. Take Conn's story, set in 1763. The heroine and her parents-in-law meet during the wedding, where the hero assures her that everything will be ok - even if she's a travelling actress with an illegitimate child."
1,PROTECT YOUR FINANCIAL ASSETS!!!,"Someone in this organization is a thief. Soon (but not too soon) after making this purchase -- my only UK-based purchase in eons -- I had two unauthorized charges made in the UK show up on my credit card (Skype and Moneybookers). Amazingly enough, this vendor's internet site uses Skype! Do NOT get stuck dealing with what I had to deal with to stop the unauthorized use of my card.Oh, yeah, and the material started to fray after a month of wear.I hope Amazon or the vendor do not take this down unless and until there is a guarantee by d14posters that they will protect purchase information."
2,Hmm...,"I'm gentle with my cell phone and the snap that was attached to my phone kept snapping off until it finally broke. I love the strap, but the plastic is incredibly weak.I also didn't really care for the 'free product' that was sent to me to remind me to review. Pot leaves never were my thing, and it's in a seller's best interest to make come up with better ploys for reviews. I thought it was just flat out stupid and crude."
4,Excellent for absorbing voices,"After a great deal of research, I ordered this product. Much less expensive that other Auralex products, the wedgies are very VERY good at absorbing voices. I needed to block the transfer of low level conversation from one side of a room to another, and these are the best and cheapest option.I would not suggest using these if you need general soundproofing, or absorbtion."
5,Auralex Wedgie-24 an outstanding value,"I've ordered five of these packs now, and I'm impressed with this product...for my new recording booth, they're an outstanding fit and great finish (oh, and by the way, the really do knock down the echo to almost zero!)."
3,"lyrics can be offensive for some, but phat beats for every1","Loco (Dead At Birth) delivers phat beats and slick rhymes...probably the most offensive lyrics I have ever heard. As long as you can take the lyrics lightly, this album can provide a good laugh as well as hours of good listening. Overall, a great album..."
1,Why?????????????,Who's idea was it to make a cd with an album from Art Blakey and The Modern Jazz Quartet on it. They're also completely differen't style groups. I find people who like Blakey loathe MJQ and MJQ lovers don't like Blakey! So who in the world would buy this cd for both albums?It's beyond me..............
4,I have mixed feelings about this book,"I applaud the author for the information he supplies and for his encouraging attitude towards surviving cancer. On the other hand, as a scientist, I cannot agree that cancer is not a disease. I can agree, however, that cancer is a treatable disease and that many aspects of conventional treatment of it are flawed. I would also like to note that recent research has demonstrated that several essential nutrients, particularly vitamin D and the mineral selenium can significantly reduce the risk of getting cancer and that supplementation with these nutrients is probably a good idea."
2,"Very good,but misleading","It's good reading,with some data likeky picked from science books or newspaper. The writer should know that immunization saved many,many lives.He also criticizes medical system, drug companies (I agree to certain degree). His conclusion made me angry. His third life or something! Please,spare me with ......like that."
1,magical thinking,"If cancer isn't a disease, what is? Some cancers can be treated quite successfully. Others are nearly certain to kill you. My biggest concern with alternative medicine is the blaming of the victim philosophy. You will die unless you reduce your stress!I am sorry, but meditation and herbs are not going to cure you of pancreatic cancer. Odds are you are going to die. Just like meditation and herbs do not restore sight to the blind or regrow limbs that have been severed. It is sad, but it is the way of the world. In the end we all die and magical thinking will not change that fact."
5,Be Informed of Your Options,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2009. After a biopsy, an MRI and consulting with a surgeon, oncologist and radiologist, it appeared that I needed to do more research regarding my situation. None of the doctors mentioned or even suggested about getting to the root cause of why I had cancer. That to me was extremely disturb-ing. Treating only the symptom and not the cause was not what I wanted to do. A dear friend recommended Mr. Moritz's book ""Cancer Is Not A Disease"" which I have read and reread. I am following the regimen stated in the book and am doing terrific. Let's keep the options open for CHOICE. It is still our CHOICE and not that of some group, government entity or pharmaceutical company that should be making these decisions for us (individuals).Jan B"
5,Cancer Book - Andreas Moritz,"This book is a life saver for me. I already knew there was more to the CANCER story, but Moritz really puts the whys and whatfors in laymen's terms and the suggestions he made for a cure really worked for me. Yesterday, my tumor was literally purged from my body !"
1,Nonsense,Please read this book if you're interested in learning about cancer from a competely unqualified source. This book is absolute nonsense. Ask a doctor if he/she thinks cancer is survival mechanism and you'll probably be able to hear the laughter for hundreds of miles around you.
5,great pack if your needing a large daypack,"My wife and I have several different packs , but this is my favorite. Plenty of room very expandable yet doesn't feel large or bulky. I would highly recommend it."
1,"No, no power for you.","$3000 is about double what the price should be, and that's if we were talking about a better brand. This is such a ripoff that I would go as far as to say that the other review for this is fake and they are just trying to see how stupid people are. Maybe they figure that someone has to be stupid enough to buy this. These types of scams have no place here. Do not buy this."
1,Fake panel phisycal size limts it,Theres no way that his panel is 400 watts it will take 110 3.6 to 4 watt cells to make such a panel phisycal size even shows it is not what is addvertised.
1,If you're expecting a book . . .,"you'll be disappointed, as this item consists of a bundle of pamphlets. The pamphlets may be okay as pamphlets go (I wouldn't know; I left the bundle unopened) but you won't want this item unless you want a bunch of pamphlets to pass out."
3,Disappointing!,"Kristine W has talent, there's no doubt about it but this 2DVD set was disappointing. I'm surprised she put her name to it as being an offical release. I was aware the tracks were repeated and listed as either ""bootleg"" or ""remixed"" so I was expecting to sit through the same tracks more than once. The poor standard of quality in these ""bootleg"" and ""remixed"" track was pointless. The offical filmclips are camp & of high quality for the most part and could have been issued on 1 DVD. There are at times poor picture quality and poor audio. So keep this in mind. This is for fans only."
2,bad edited,Don't wait the videos you were looking for. There is some samples even from the Technotronic Pump up the jam!!Quality is poor. This one works only for the huge fans which wanna see everything.Kristine & Co - why??????
2,VERY disappointing,"Wow, the quality of 80% of the videos is downright abyssmal. I think one of Kristine's kids must have downloaded mom's videos from YouTube (yes, it's that bad) and then authored a DVD (oh yeah, the production is poor, too). You'll swear you're watching a VHS or bit torrent downloaded video at times. The Promo Only logo is even there!!! I'm a huge Kristine W fan, but this DVD collection really is the pits."
2,Why harpsichord?,"I am a vey big fan of Keith Jarrett. I have more than 40 Jarrett albums (solo + trio) and I think I've heard the Koeln Concert more than 50 times. I am not very familiar with Bach's WTC. I have only 3 other interpretetions: Richter (piano) - very poetic, Gould (piano) - new and sometimes totally different than the book and a cheap harpsichord interpretion.Jarrett does something really strange. He playes Part I on piano and Part II on harpsichord. I have no idea why he does that. The CD's look the same (just different colors) and there is no way you would expect to get Part II on a different instrument than Part I. The interpretetion (if you can listen to that instrument) is the worst I've heard so far."
4,Entertaining,"Playing for Peanuts is a fun look into the life of minor league baseball. It's not such a glamorous life before the bigs, and this gives an idea of the day to day grind. It's fun to see the personalities of the guys off the field as well."
2,CENSORED,"Did you see the WILDLY popular Wally Backman youtube videos? Then decide I want to BUY the DVD to see more of this amazing and unabashed character.If that is the case DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.Don't make the same mistake I did.There is an uncensored version that you want. Not this one.I find it EXTREMELY confusing that they'd sell an uncensored version. Lets be honest, WHO IS BUYING THIS FORTHE CINEMATOGRAPHY, and inspirational story???? People are buying Playing For Peanuts because they managed to capture some of the most real and captivating video of a manager and this DVD CENSORS IT!!!!!!!!I give it 2 bleeping stars."
4,Almost perfect product and great price!,"This product does what is advertised just fine: it crimps wires. I didn't want to sped a lot of money because this is just for my own house where I needed to crimp a few cables. For this, it worked well. The cables work, and I haven't noticed any performance issues with the resulting plugs. It also has little wire strippers and the like so you don't really need any other tools to get the job done. However, the outer insulator stripper that is built into the crimper seems to cut the wires too short, whenever I used the preset length the wires did not extend all of the way into the plug. Luckily, the product never really claimed to strip the outer insulator, so for the overall value of the product it isn't too much of an issue.I would recommend this crimper for anyone doing a simple residential job, but having no experience with professional installations, I have no idea how this would hold up."
2,Get a ratchet type instead,"Never got a clean crimp with this (even when using Belkin-brand plugs, what's worse). It doesn't strip small gauges or even a CAT5 jacket properly. Sometimes the catch accidentally slips in. Plus it's heavy."
1,Do not buy it!,"Worst tool ever. Possible that mine is defective but I was not able to make one good patch cord! It just didn't crimp the tab into the cable at all. Those eight little ""bars"" fit perfectly between tabs - meaning plastic.I tried it on a few differed heads with no success. Tried to adjust it with no luck. So for me it didn't work at all. Bought one in HD for 17$ it works seamless without any problems or issues. And Belkin is in dumpster right now."
2,Borderline bait and switch,"I just received this product in the mail and I was a little surprised when I opened it. Not only are the handles a different color (dark blue instead of orange) but they aren't even Belkin brand. I'm not a brand snob by any means but when the product says that it's a Belkin brand in several places, you kind of expect the product you receive to be Belkin. The tool itself looks like the one pictured (except for the handle color) but it is not a Belkin branded product and shouldn't be listed as such. I'll update the review later after I use it to create some cables but my initial impression is suspect to say the least."
3,CAT5 cable connector crimper,This item worked as expected - well made and more than adequate for home use. I bought it because of having a large quantity of CAT5 cable for free and it allows me to make my own cables. It was a much better deal than the ones I've found at a local store for $20+.
3,"Works OK, just not as pictured","The crimper I received was not the orange-handled model pictured, it had blue handles, and it said it was from the Belkin Pro line...That said, the crimp tool works just fine now, but I had to use a utility knife to carve some of the plastic bits out to get a Belkin RJ45 plug to fit in it to crimp it. I only wanted it to crimp a few cables from my computer room to the entertainment room without having to drill giant holes to feed the cable through, so for the price, it served its purpose and I have it to use again if one of them goes bad."
3,Capable Tool,"It is nothing special. It does the job. The only problem with it is that it has no way to stay closed. The spring keeps it open. A rubber band fixed that though, and if that is the only complaint it is not a bad deal for the price I got it for."
1,No Good,"The one I got (in 2011) looks just like the picture, so I think it's still the same blue one. It does not say Belkin anywhere on the tool. I bought it because I trusted the name brand. I believe it is not Belkin made.That would be ok if it worked, but it does not align right with the connectors. I have other brand crimpers and they work like a charm. I thought ""how hard can it be for one to work?"" Well,this one doesn't. I used it some and now it's older, but I'm sick of finishing out the crimps by hand with a screwdriver and tossing it.Time to buy a decent brand name crimper. This is junk. Your milage may vary. Perhaps some of these have better alighnement. For me it just adds to the cost of buying a working one to have bought this one first.Just sayin'."
4,Belkin RJ45 review,Tool worked just fine and was delivered very quickly. I would recommend for anyone who wants to make their own ethernet lines!
2,"Too hard ,, but intresting.","Were to begine. You start off with 300$ {not that much} and a couple of healkits{it heals u}. You start with rough battels and i know it doesn't get easier. I was prety far, around the middle and it got erased, DAMN!!!. I got mad, started new and too hard that i quit. To topp it off u needed save tokens to save the game,suck doesn't. And they are hard to get, and if u dont save, when u die u start from the begging. Now here is something u can't argue. AWSOME story. It's slow but the things with the dragon power,skills,and your big rival it makes u take the game. ALso its cheap for a game."
1,Breath of fire that went into a blender,This game was Horrible! You use to much of your dragon powers and puff your dead!I picked up this game because I love Breath of fire! But this game is the worst one yet! I DO NOT reconmend that you buy this game at all.
1,This game was some ...,I never thought a breath of fire game could be this horrible.... all breath of fire games have been good except for this piece of ... I mean seriously... this game does not carry on ANY traditional qualities besides you being able to play ryu and turning into a dragon... Why the hell are there guns in this game.... what the hell does this have to do with Breath Of Fire.... the best thing about this game is the box... go to the store take your game back (if you already bought it) and buy something like Dynasty Warriors 4.
2,DO NOT use the force......,"Capcom had a good thing going with the BOF franchise. I never played the first 2, but III and IV were great games. This last installment all but killed it. First and foremost, the BEST thing about breath of fire {any of them} was the main characters ability to transform into a dragon. Its what set the BOF games apart from the rest. Is it present in Dragon Quarter ? Well, yes and no. Its there, but you definately won't be using it. Theres a gauge, everytime you use the form it drains the gauge. Theres one BIG problem. The gauge CANNOT be refilled. Nothing ..... and yes I do mean NOTHING will refill it. When it drains completely, you die. When you think about that, along with the fact that the last boss can only be defeated in dragon form .... Well, what we have here is a BOF game without dragon transformations. Theres a ton of other things I hated, such as the gameplay, game flow, story etc. But the dragon thing ticked me off the most."
1,OMG I can't believe this...,I'm sorry but this game just put a big tarnish on the BoF series it is the most horrible game I've ever played! I mean it steers completely away from what the old BoF was like and the whole system of having to restart your game countless times is nuts...more frustrating then fun...-4 stars out of 4
3,This game needs alot of attention i just do have the time!!!,"I am sure breath of fire is a great game but!!!! as for me i just don't have the time, u have to start-over at least 5 times to actually end this, to collect all the, items (sword ect.... )i only made it to 3 times then i said to myself hey!!! try something that take 8 to 12 hours i hnave that kind of time anyhow the story is very interesting i am sure it will have the fans, i for one like the game but this the first game i started and did not end, i really don't to play a game too long thats just wrong!!!!! Dragon quarters is a good RPG it's no Zelda but it has appeal, maybe one day i'll pick it up and say what the heck but as for now i prefer to play Matal Gear ha ha ha laterz gamers.........."
1,"Could have been fun, but...","I was excited for this game.I love RPGs with the FF fighting style, but the lack of saving points in the beginning frustrated me to the point of taking it out of my PS2 and throwing it across the room after I had to start from scratch twice. Am I lame? Maybe. But it wasnt an exciting game to begin with. Dont waste your time with this one !"
2,this game is VERY NOT GOOD,"the bof series has always been good...UNTIL IT HIT THE PS2!this game is flat out horrible. the battle system is not only difficult to get used to, but when you finally do get used to it, it's NOT FUN!!! the storyline is complex to the point where it's confusing and just too much work to try to keep up with. the dialog being boring doesn't help much.so avoid this like the black death."
4,lamb_of_god,U KNOW...!!! ALL OF U THAT CRITICIZE THIS GAME...U R JUST MAD ATTHAT U CANT BEAT BEAT THE GAME!!! U SHOULDNT B WASTING UR TIME TELLING US UR BS WHEN ALL U HAVE TO DO IS SELL THE FREAKIN'GAME!!! To me the game was AWESOME!!!! it is an easy game!! All u have to have is PATIENCE!! so every1 that likes this game and appreciates it then thank you very much:) for the rest of u...!!!!! STOP CRITIZING THE GAME PLZ!!!
3,Rent before buy,"I was a bit upset with the way this game turned out when I unfortunately bought the game before trying it out first. The battle system is turn based like a tactics game, and the game in my opinion is quite difficult if you are not used to it at all. If you are a saving fanatic, I would suggest you be aware, cause you are required to use tokens to save. This game takes special care, and needs to be sorta mastered before actually getting the hang of it. But the game still is kinda boring."
1,Quantity Not Clear,"Because of the image, I thought I was getting a pack with different masks. It was only one mask and I did not like the design. I paid more than $10 for just one piece (Incl. Shipping). Not a high quality product."
4,Good toy for crawler!,"My 8 month old neice recently came for a visit and I pulled out this toy which my daughter had recieved for her 2nd birthday. My neice had a ""BALL"" ( no pun intended) with the turtle and crawled in and out of the pit over and over and over! Great exercise and kept her from climbing the furniture! :) I agree it does need more balls with it but I have never gotten around to buying more. I am planning to pull it out this summer to use as a swimming pool since my now 4 year old daughter has outgrown it as a ball pit."
3,Not enough balls!,"This ball pit is very cute, but hardly comes with any balls. What we thought was going to be a cheap $10.00 toy, turned into $30.00 because we had to spend $20.00 on extra balls. My 14 month old absolutely loves it; I just wish it came with enough balls to fill it up."
2,A little messy...,"This glue came with the kit. It has great hold, but it is a little messy. Even after you spray it tends to drip, and you have to be careful spraying, as it has a tendency to run. The one can was not enough to finish my project, so I has to got o Home Depot and but another can. (different brand) The second can is much better. It has a lighter spray nozzle, and does not drip as much. I probably would not buy this again."
5,I like this new age of appliance repair,"Remember when you had to drive to the specific dealer and describe the symptoms or the part while the person behind the counter looked it up? Or else you called a repairman and paid a fortune? Now you can research the part online (free), order from Amazon (easy), watch a video about how to install the part (free)--all by yourself! It's great! The switch I ordered arrived in a timely manner; I installed it in the kitchen range hood in minutes; I'm a hero."
4,A Great Aircraft Carrier Reference Book!,"This is a very comprehensive book about every aircraft carrier or aviation ship that has ever been conceived of and possibly a few that very few even know about. The book is divided into two sections. There is the general history of aircraft carriers and then a comprehensive listing of aircraft carriers by country and class. The book does tend to lean towards the British side of history, but it is still a great book for those fascinated with aircraft carriers!"
2,Not Recommended,"In terms of material and design, these are at best light duty adapters. I purchased this to use a BNC antenna on a receiver with an SMA antenna jack. Unfortunately, the depth and threads are so thin that the adapter barely fits on the receiver. I returned the adapters to seller for a quick refund, though I had to pay return shipping. Diamond Antenna makes a more robust BNC/SMA adapter but at about $9.00. They are not available on Amazon.com, but from ham radio outlets."

1,ACDSee 1.6 horrible app!,"Actually, I don't know what problem(s) the above user (A software user from Manhattan Beach, CA USA) is talking about on the OS X installation issue. ACDSee 1.6 does install and operate under OS X and does not revert in any way.That having been said, it is without a doubt the worst application of its kind available today. The UI is horrendous and will make you need glasses if you don't already. Also it lacks many features of its Windows counterpart, which is actually quite good. The bottomline is that I think ACD Systems wanted to claim cross-platform compatability, but this product makes them look like fools.Do not buy it under any circumstances!"
4,Is He Faking It?,"These days you can't be too skeptical about the lengths a person might go to for attention. One doctor implies that certain amnesia patients (without physical damage) may just not want to remember. Nobody even asks the question what could have happened that night. Was he kidnapped? Did he witness or even commit a murder? He always shows a trace of grief, guilt, or regret somehow."
3,"watchable, probably fake (imho)","This is an interesting doc. I think the controversy over whether or not it's ""real"" (=whether or not Doug really has amnesia) makes it a lot more interesting.On the one side, the filmmaker reports that Doug's family & friends are all convinced he's lost his memory. On the other side ... how is it that his language is unimpaired, and he knows enough to leave the subway and turn himself in to the police--and yet he doesn't recognize the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, doesn't recognize the term West Indian Cricket (""Is that a drink or an insect?""), even though he was a huge fan and played cricket himself in school, and doesn't recognize the music of the Rolling Stones.And that's just addressing things that show up in the movie--see the article in the Washington Post for more problematic info.Put me down as an American skeptic, but watch the doc and decide for yourself."
3,Oppurtunistic?,"While overall, the movie was fairly engaging, I kept thinking, ""this has gotta be one of the most uninteresting persons I've ever watched on film.""Tis about a Scotsman who wakes up in NYC with no recollection of who or where he is. The beginning is great as we get to see the drama and footage of his first days in the police station and hospital. After that, we watch as he visits his sister and father and we realize that this person seems so artificial. It delves into conversations regarding extistentialism and really should have talked about other people's cases instead of making the whole film about this seemingly selfish silver-spooned whiner's unappreciative recuperation.Worth seeing as it sparked some good conversation amongst my wife and I, but overall, it seemed that this feller was helping launch his friend's movie career by creating an uneccesary by-product of a tragedy."
5,"With this album, Larue proves she is one of the best around.",Fan of the Baltimore Consort have long appreciated Custer Larue's talent. This collection of ballads will delight these followers and win her new listeners. The selection of material is well-considered and the delivery is flawless.
4,Christmas gift,"I thought my husband would love it, but he never uses it. The product is great but it just sits."
3,"This one was ok, not as good as the first two.","I was very sad to see that Mikael from Opeth was not in this one, but was excited to see what Peter from Hypocrisy would sound like in Bloodbath. The vocals were good but I liked Mikaels better, this album was definitly not as catchy as Resurection Through Carnage. I always Thought Dan Swano was an excellent drummer and should have drummed on this album like the first two. Martin Axe is a good drummer but his work with Witchery was better and they should put out another album.Overall this is their heaviest album yet, but I liked the catchier riffs and beats of the first two much better."
5,Bloodbath sounds WAAAAAAYYYYYYY better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Man I am so impressed with Nightmares Made Flesh. This cd has got to be the best album of 2005. Having Peter Tagtgren on lead vocals instead of Mike Akerfeldt isnt a bad thing either. I think Peter does a better job anyway. His vocal range is way higher then Mike on anyday. The guitar work is a lot better also along with the drums. Martin Axenrot takes over the drums where as Dan Swano(drummer in resurrection through carnage) takes to the guitar.This album is so brutal you'll wanna kill whoever you are in the room with. I think ther are no weak songs on this album. They all kick major ass. ""Eaten"" is actually my personal favorite."
3,This book is ok,"I bought this book for my psychology Research method class, we hardly opened the book but the few things I did have to look into it were helpful."
5,Excellent and easy to follow,"I'm up to page 218 and have to say it is so easy to follow. A paragraph outling a new concept, followed by step by step instructions with graphic pictures showing you each step in case your lost or confused. I have used other books and their step by step approach misses critical steps because they assume you know, thus leaving you stranded and frustrated. I look forward to the Intermediate / Advanced level; particularly the Data, ActionScript, XML and so on. Keep up the great work"
4,Information not found elsewhere about 99 bird species,"A nice companion volume to _Wildflower Folklore_ by the same author, and it follows the same format. A physical description of each bird is accompanied by a realistic line drawing of it, and then the folklore comes along. These comments might include name origins or unusual habits or wives' tales or stories of the species told by native people. It's these details that make this volume (and others by Laura C. Martin) unique. It's not a guidebook per se: rather, it's a supplement to standard bird books; one that will tell you what the others won't. Trail guides and naturalists who like to personalize their tours will find this work a valuable addition to their collections."
3,Jesus Mission to Jerusalem,"This book is one of the crucial monographs regarding the Lukan journey narrative.Although it is an outstanding work, two pitfalls should be noted.Firstly, this book is recorded by typewriter.Secondly, it is written in English, but in fact most part in German and so on.For these reasons, I rate this item 3 stars, not 4 or more."
2,1025 mg sodium per 35 calorie stick = insane,"I wondered why I was feeling sluggish. I checked the sodium from Buffalo Bills website and each stick has 35 calories, 2 grams of protein and 1025 mg sodium. They also have un-chewable sections, like a slim j."
3,Tastes just like a slim-Jim,"I don't eat slim Jim's, due to the chicken in them & greasy feeling.I was hoping for a beef stick that was dry and ""meaty"" but instead these were just a little bit longer than a mini slim jim, greasy, and tasted almost identical to slim jims. They also are loaded with sodium! I've never seen such a small amount of food with over 1000 mg of sodium. Would not buy again."
4,Really good beef sticks!,"Way better then slim Jim's not grease at all, nice snap too itOver all really good beef stick, would order again maybe next week lol."
2,OK BEEFSTICKS,These beef sticks were ok. Kind of like Slim Jims but not as much grease. Probably would not buy again.
1,Didn't like it,"Had a strong sour, preservative taste instead of hot or spicy. We were expecting it to be spicy like Wild Bills beef jerky."
3,"Definitely not but, but not that bad either","If you're looking for the bite form the Habanero Slim Jims you're not going to find it here. I would say, as someone who grew up on hot wings in Western New York, these really don't rise to the level of mild. There's no level of hotness that I can discern.Now as for taste....That's a different story. I've grown pretty accustomed to the taste and kick of the Habanero Slim Jims and these do taste very different from those. Is it a better taste? From the stock Slim Jims, yes. But I like the heat bite so from that perspective it doesn't compete. They don't sweat like Slim Jims though which does tell me there's better product in this stick though.I'm probably going to order the other flavors to see how they taste, but I'm going to stick with the Slim Jims unless Buffalo Bill puts out a beef stick with the same kick."
1,LED Tire Light,"This is the single worse product that I have bought. DO NOT BUY IT. The on-line store has discontinued selling them. The store by the way was great, but the product is awful."
1,LED Tire Lights,"I've seen one one the road. My son (11yrs) thought it was cool. I thought it was a little immature. It was on a tricked out, late model Eclipse and it looked more like a shuttle from Star Trek (TNG) that it did a car.How much attention do you need to bring to yourself? How bad to you want to be the center of attention? What extremes do you need to go to be cool? If you need these, you need a life. My son having an appeal for them and me having my eyebrow raised makes me wonder if the person driving knows who is really going to be giving them the attention they so desperately need."
5,"Stylistic departure, but still great!","Let me say this up front -- ""To Die For"" is not a typical Linda Howard book. This is a wonderful romantic comedy with a slight suspense element that works more as a plot device than anything else. Stylistically, it most resembles ""Mr. Perfect,"" since Howard has tended towards straight suspense in recent years, but it's even lighter than ""Mr. Perfect.""That said, I loved this book! I read a lot of first-person romantic comedies, and this ranked up there with the best of them. I was prepared to not like the narrator upon her introduction, but warmed to her quickly, and the hero is a good foil for her.Snappy dialogue, good romantic chemistry -- this has all of the ingredients of a good romantic comedy! Congratulations to Howard for a successful transition to a different style."
4,Buy This Book!,"I love this book and the characters. It is a mystery but more so a romance novel, imo. Blair is high maintenance trouble to Wyatt, her cop fiancee. Example- they dated 3 times 2 years ago and he never called her again. They had great chemistry together and never forgot each other. During a murder investigation he comes back into her life and wants her back. Her thoughts? They walk out, they gotta crawl back. Get the picture? Don't you love her already? Wyatt gives as good as he gets but she knows how to push his buttons, especially with her many lists of his faults she leaves lying around. I couldn't put this book down and laughed all the way through it and the follow up book Drop Dead Gorgeous. I hope the author continues the series. A nice light read with mystery, romance, and laughs galore. Not my usual kind of read so I was surprised how much I enjoyed these books."
3,Liked other Linda Howard books better,"This book was fun, but the main character was a bit juvenile.I enjoyed other Linda Howard books more, such as Mr. Perfect,Up Close and Dangerous and Now You See Her."
1,dissapointing,"So I tried to read the book and that was bad enough. The audiobook made it that much worse I believe. The lead character, Blair, is just plain annoying. She is the type of character that usually is a supporting character, not the lead and it definitely fell short. I think that the narrator just added to my annoyance with the whole book. I really miss LH's beginning good reads. Hopefully we will see more of those in the future, and hopefully give them a chance."
1,One of the most all-time stupid books ever written,"Stupid, characters not believable -- there is nothing good about it. It's an insult to readers everywhere. Linda Howard has written some decent books, but she must have been smoking crack when she wrote this."
2,True Romance?,"I am a long time fan of Linda Howard. I was excited (as most fans are)when I saw her new book on the shelf. Let's face it. She is tried and true and you know what you are getting when you pick up one of her books. While I did enjoy aspects of the plot and the characters, the sizzle that is her trade mark is absent. Great plot, memorable charecters and smokin' love scenes are the reason we love Linda;implied love scenes can be left to another author.Her love scenes remind me of the Harlequins I read as a teen."
1,Another Disappointment!,"I'm not sure what's going on with Linda Howard, but this has got to be one of the worst books she's written in a long time. It was even worse than, Kiss Me While I Sleep, and I didn't think anything got worse than that.The 1st person account was ""totally tacky,"" especially as we didn't know what the hero (Wyatt) was thinking. The plot was boring and predictable, and the sex scenes (always Linda's best parts,) were just plain boring. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that it read like a harlequin romance.The story did not read like a typical Howard story. It almost seemed like she wrote this story YEARS ago, but just decided to publish it. Take my word: Don't pay full price for it like I did. You may just want to borrow this one from your local library."
1,What a disappointment,"Normally I snatch up a new Linda Howard book and relish reading each and every word. But this is not what I've come to expect from the author of such jewels as Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride and the MacKenzie series. Her ""inner beach bunny""? Give this one a miss."
1,Is there two Linda Howards?,"Maybe it's wrong to review something that you couldn't finish, but you should know that this is nothing like any Linda Howard book you've ever read. The first few paragraphs I thought maybe I was reading one of the characters personel journal. When I got to the second chapter and the first person POV didn't change any, I went to the back cover to see if this was really the same Linda Howard that I thought it was. I pushed through chapter three and just couldn't go on. It's a silly book."
3,Nothing Is Worthy ..To Die For.,"Blair has a copycat client at the Great Bods, her fitness center in North Carolina, a member who starts to imitate her style and dress. Blair witness the murder behind the gym in the parking lot, and thinks that she was the intended victim.This is a witty Southern version of womanhood, fit as a giddle and ready for love -- with her former lover, Wyatt Bloodworth, the lieutenant in charge of solving the homicide. Blair decides to investigate the other woman's life on her own and runs into trouble.This romance plus mystery is shades of Linda Fairstein. Linda Howard has written many other such romances, including WHITE LIES, ALMOST FOREVER, MR. PERFECT and mysteries, KILLING TIME and DYING TO PLEASE. The climax at the apprehension of the killer proves to Blair that she needs a man to take care of her after all, and who better than Lt. Wyatt with whom she had a relationship a few years before her successful business venture."
4,"entertaining, fast paced and a little silly","Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors, and although this novel was definitely different than her usual fare - it was engaging and pretty funny. It was actually refreshing that it was in first person, I found it made it much easier to identify with a heroine I might otherwise have labeled a dumb bimbo and basically ignored. Even though I am sure I have met this hero before in some other incarnation in another Howard book, I have not met anyone quite like the heroine. She is silly, funny, a little outrageous and certainly unique.I found myself happy with the outcome at the end of the book and was reminded of the humor that was such a great part of Mr. Perfect. Basically I always love Ms.Howard's work (except for the travesty that was Dying to Please -- skip that one) and hope she writes more dra-medys."
1,Very Unsettling,"The plot and storyline was excellent. However my only problem with this book is that it is in first person. You dont even get a clue as to who the killer is, and you get no feel for the other characters, especially Wyatt. I also found Blair to be exactly who she hated being treated like: a dumb blond. She is not that bright and is just damn annoying. Im sorry its the first person thing. If you like first person go for it. It was a great storyline behind it but the whole 1st person thing traumatized me."
2,Not up to her usual standards,"This book was pretty bad. I have read other books by Linda Howard and they were great. The cover looked like it was a serious book with suspense. Instead, this was a silly, and unrealistic book. Also, the constant bickering between the main characters was very tiresome."
4,"Not much suspense, but a lot of witty romance",The title is a misnomer because this is not a murder mystery. The who-dun-it part is so minimal when the majority of the book is about the romance between Blair and Wyatt. I didn't like the first-person smart alecky narration at first but that grew on me as I got to know the character. Parts of the romantic banter are downright funny. The book could have been about half in length. Good beach reading!
3,Channeling Janet Evanovich,"When I read the first few pages the style immediately reminded me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels. Which I love. However in this it appears to me that Linda Howard is trying too hard to let us know her character thinks really cool thoughts, acts the dumb blonde but is really, really smart.That said, the story still hooked me enough to find out how it ends. Linda Howard certainly knows how to write a romance/mystery with very hot guys. I can overlook the frequent 'personal asides' from Blair on how to handle life and men because she has me wondering who the attempted killer is."
4,To die laughing,"I loved this book, mainly because of the heroine's smart ass wit. I am very happy to see this female character step out from the cookie cutter virtuous heroines you become used to. She does not feel overly obligated to help those who wrong her. She seems to be a real strong person, caring and I love that. However, I wasnt happy about the hero in this book. Particularly his remarks about their sexual relationship and the no means no thing. hey if a woman is resisting your ass, take a hint and move on. That was the main chink in the chain for me, kinda pissed me off. But I love Linda Howard, she is one of the best alongside Anne Stuart, Judith McNaught(see Perfect)."
1,He cranked my tractor?,"When I read that line I knew it was going to be downhill all the way. Is this really Linda Howard? If it is, it reads like an early manuscript that got rejected three dozen times and now that she's famous, oh, what the heck, let's publish it too. I couldn't even LIKE the heroine and the supposed hero never added up to much either. I kept reading because of my faith in Ms. Howard's ability to tell a story but sadly, this time my faith was not rewarded.He cranked my tractor? Yes, that line is really in the book. Enough said."
4,It's not so bad...,"If you're a die-hard LH fan, you have to read this book, it's worth it. But if this is your first book of her's read something else. It had it's funny moments, but I wish LH had made Blair a little bit less ditzy. I caught myself rolling my eyes at one point or another.Maria"
1,Another Disappointment!!!!,"I'm not sure what's going on with Linda Howard, but this has got to be one of the worst books she's written in a long time. It was even worse than, Kiss Me While I Sleep, and I didn't think anything got worse than that.The 1st person account was ""totally tacky,"" especially as we didn't know what the hero (Wyatt) was thinking. The plot was boring and predictable, and the sex scenes (always Linda's best parts,) were just plain boring. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that it read like a harlequin romance.The story did not read like a typical Howard story. It almost seemed like she wrote this story YEARS ago, but just decided to publish it. Take my word: Don't pay full price for it like I did. You may just want to borrow this one from your local library."
1,disappointed,"First and last time I read Linda Howard if this is her typical style. A little reality please. A police officer takes the victim home with him. Yeah sure. Happens all the time. A woman who pretends to be dumb when it suits her gives all woman a bad name. Makes me want to scream grow up Blair! Nobody cares that you were homecoming queen 10 years ago. Ex-husbands new wife is jealous of you, sure thing! I usually read murder mysteries and this is not even close."
3,Good,"Linda Howard has a way of keeping the reader totally drawn into her writing until the very last page. Although most of the time with romance novels, a reader can gage how the ending is going to be and this book was really no different. This book was good, but not one of her best. The book focused to much on two characters and not enough ""outsiders"" to keep the reader from ""guessing"" what was going to happen next."
4,Almost perfect,"I really enjoyed the book, but had to get past my reluctance to read a book written in first person. I'm not a big fan of first person. Too much I, I, I. It was a surprise to find this book written that way, but all in all it was a funny, entertaining read."
4,funny and sexy,"I liked the romance, I liked the suspense. Sometimes the main character Blair was a little clueless, but okay. The hero was very hot and they had some funny banter. Not sure we need a sequel, but I may check it out."
3,3 1/2 stars ... much better than I expected. (SPOILERS.),"Although at first I was thrown off by the 1st person narrative and the heroine's general kind of ditzy, silly narrative - as soon as Wyatt Bloodsworth entered the picture, I got totally sucked in. The chemistry between the two was great and soon it didn't matter that we weren't hearing his side of the story... although that might have been nice to know why he had just not called her in two years. That was quite frustrating for me, I almost wanted to strangle Blair and be like ASK HIM ALREADY.The two year gap between the last time they dated and the novel was quite unbelievable - that is a LONG time, I would have preferred a shorter gap.. And A MUCH better explanation. His explanation was so anticlimactic.Anyways, with that being said, despite some very cheesy scenes and lines, and despite the fact that you won't feel like you are reading a Linda Howard novel - It was cute and romantic, and I utterly enjoyed it."
2,"Great guy, annoying heroine","I love all of Linda Howard's books, but this one is way down on my list. I found myself wondering what an intelligent guy like Wyatt was doing with this chick! She is a very annoying heroine."
1,Beyond Disapointing,I was disappointed by Kiss Me While I Sleep; but this book just went too much in the opposite direction. It is fine for someone who is not used to the execellent quality that Linda Howard usually porvides in her novels. Until I regain confidence in Ms. Howard I will not purchase any more hard cover books by her; instead I will wait until the second hand paperbacks are available.
1,To die from boredom,"Probably the worst Howard book that I've read. To Die For is pretty much a carbon copy of all those latest bestsellers about shopping addicts. The main heroine is annoying to the point when you really want her dead. She keeps repeating how she is so smart and great, but misunderstood as a dumb blond former cheerleader stereotype. However she acts and thinks exactly like one of those proverbal ""dumb blondes"". And that's besides her inability to say ""no"" to sex with the main male character, even though he behaves like a chauvinistic pig and she knows it.The plot is weak and totally cliche. Very disappointing. Not something I expected from Linda Howard at all."
1,Disliked this book,"I couldn't even finish this book. It was just something about the main character and the way this book was written. I'm not a big fan of Linda Howard, though her book Dream Man was pretty decent."
2,seriously lacking,"I was very dissapointed in this book. The main character is very hard to like at all. Annoying really. Half way through I wanted to stop reading, but I continued. I like most of her books, but this was definitely a dud."
1,This story died a slow death!,"It took me 4 days to finish a Linda Howard book!!! I put it down time and time again. Unheard of! This story was so sophomoric I cannot believe Linda wrote it. But the Dedication gives a hint. A high maintenance friend who gave her the inspiration for the story.It was almost as bad as Janet Evanovich's co-written books. Awful! No way did it come close to her MacKenzie series. I did like ""Cry No More"". Wyatt just didnt do it for me this time.Very disappointed."
1,Warning the MP3 version is downright painful,"I just could not get through the audio version of this book. The narrators voice was irritating and painful. Her voice gave the impression that the Heroine? was a vapid, celf-centered narrow minded bimbo. And geez why does an author feel the need to take up 8 minutes in dialog on how the Heroine chooses what color of panty to wear that day? I kept listening hoping that something awful and paiful would happen to her.."
3,"Good, but not Great!!","Linda Howard is one of my all time favorite authors. It is hard to say anything bad about her work. Other than the first person POV it was really good. If you can get past how annoying the girl is you'll be OK. Usually I stay up late and try to get her books read in two nights, this one got on my nerves so bad it took almost a week to read it. If I wasn't familiar with her work, I would not have finished it."
5,Great author not afraid of risk (new genre),"`To Die For' describes how I feel about all of Linda Howard's books. She is my favorite author, one that I use as a bar for all other romance authors to rise to and in this book she doesn't disappoint. Blair Mallory at first comes across as an air headed cheerleader type similar to other leading characters in Chick Lit genre; however Ms. Howard instills in her the usual logical and practical characteristics that save Blair from fading into the cliché characters ones sees with this particular form. While this story is written in first person, I am amazed at how well we get to know Wyatt since he is only told from Blair's perspective. I believe this is owed to Ms. Howard's strength in writing dialogue. This book is definitely a keeper for me."
2,Not what I Expected.,"If constant bickering is what you like reading about, this book is for you.I was thouroughly disappointed after the first 100 pages. The book felt cheaper to me, and I couldn't find the suspense after that.The book just does't hold a mature feel, and it read like the two main characters where still in highschool.The only way I'd recommend this is if you'd read avery other romance/suspense novel there is."
2,dissappointing,"I agree that the last few Linda Howard books haven't been that great - no plot, or just plain boring, but the sex at least was hot and steamy and it made up for the horrible story, but her new book, To Die For had a really boring first person story and what the heck happened to her hot and steamy sex scenes?? She glossed over the sex like it was a Harlequin novel. I feel cheated!"
2,"Should be called ""To Shoot At""","This book has what must be one of the most annoying heros ever, and the heroine isn't much better. She sounds like an airhead, and somehow the hero's obliviously cheerful boorishness never makes a dent in her lust for him. Feh."
1,To Die For,"I BUY LINDA HOWARD BOOKS JUST ON THE NAME, DONT EVEN READ THE BACK. BOY DID I MAKE A MISTAKE THIS TIME. SHE WROTE IT IN THE FIRST PERSON, WHICH IS SOMETHING SHE'S NEVER DONE BEFORE. CAN'T READ 1ST PERSON. I REALLY ,REALLY TRIED BECAUSE I LOVE HOWARD BUT COULDN'T DO IT AND I'M REALLY UNHAPPY THAT I SPENT $ 8.50 FOR A BOOK I CAN'T READ. I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME AND WONT JUST TAKE IT ON NAME ALONE."
1,Silliest book I've ever read,"Normally I enjoy Linda Howard's books, but this was so silly it can't even qualify as horrible. When the heroine rambles on about how to make coffee, you know the author is trying desperately to fill up the pages any way she can. This was one of the few books I couldn't force myself to finish, because I just didn't care how it ended."
3,Excellent reference but lacking sufficient illustrations,"For those trying to figure out the difference between an SCT (or what SCT means) and other telescopes this is a very useful book. It contains much useful background material and history, but falls short in providing a full understanding of the interworkings of this type of telescope. The inclusion of some ""cutaway"" or ""exploded view"" drawing would go a long way in helping the reader visualize the mechanisms behind the covers. This would be very useful to someone trying to fully understand the optical system of the SCT."
4,Works well... but finding replacements blades..,"... that are reasonably priced is a problem. The replacement blades themselves aren't terrible expensive but the shipping costs from all the suppliers I've seen cost 2x what the blade costs.Microplane doesn't have these blades in any major hardware stores (ACE, HomeDepot, Lowes, Menards, Crafty Beaver etc..). I haven't found anywhere within a 100 miles that sells these and I live in Chicago. I wish I had looked into this before I purchased these. If I had realized that, I never would've purchased.Other than that.. the blades work well and are easy to use. I give 4 stars for the product itself but really 3 stars should be the rating -- even a very good product has to have readily available replacement parts at a reasonable price point."
5,Christmas Gift,I got this yesterday from my boyfriend and I love it. It's very pretty and I was extremely happy to unwrap it. =)
5,Very entertaining and music that even the parents will sing,"Both my 7 and 3 year old children loved Arlie the Alligator book and cassette. I also gave it to a friend of mine with children the same age. The 3 year old memorized all the words and music and goes around the house singing. The 7 year old loves to read and sing along. The book is a wonderful, feel-good story. Excellent for both very young and older children."
2,success depends on your windows,If you have old sash windows that are loose in their sashes and close differently at different times this product will be a BIG ZERO...the post and metal ring have to line up the same way every time..or they will not work...
2,"Pretty bracelet, but...","I just got this bracelet for Christmas. I have small wrists so it fits great, most bracelets are just too big for me. There are no sharp edges at all on the bracelet so it's great for wearing all the time, it won't catch on clothes or scratch my babies. The reason I only gave it 2 stars is that the pearls are not pink, they are peach. I got the matching earrings & necklace which both have PINK pearls so hopefully Amazon will exchange this bracelet so my new jewelry will match."
4,Not quite as pretty in person.,"It almost looks fake in person, I bought it as a gift, but I don't know that I would buy one again."
2,Sounds just OK to me,"A couple good songs, but the remainder left me feeling like something was missing. She has some talent (that comes through on the two songs I enjoyed), but still seems to be trying to 'come into her own'. Not that great, but not the worst CD I have ever bought either."
5,Hauntingly Poetic--BUY IT!,"I first saw Rose open for the Indigo Girls in Saratoga, NY over the summer and bought this CD after the show. It is a beautiful recording. Quiet and soft, yet strikingly memorable. Rose is a welcome addition to the folk scene in the US. I cannot say ""BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!"" loudly or forcefully enough."
5,The Good Knight comes through again!,"If you and your children loved Good Night, Good Knight, you'll love this book. Once again, the Good Knight helps those cute little dragons - this time with their colds. You'll love the remedy that finally works (Mom's chicken soup) and the cute ending. My kids are 5 and 8, and they both enjoyed it."
1,Stay away,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
5,THE VERY BEST,Hi! Are you confused whether or not you want to buy this? Well I am in 7th grade! This is the best thing next to SHOPPING!...! I'm just begging my mom to but this game! It can help you type really fast! i can type 120 WPM! After 3 days in Mavis Beacons Class I could type 60 WPM! Now thats what I call improvement!

You can play whenever you want to! I cant wait to get my copy! It's not boring and I just want to get it out of enjoyment! Mavis is just a great program!
3,Spacing after punctuation marks,"The Mavis Typing program should space two (2) spaces after the following punctuation marks: Period, Colon, Question Mark, and exclamation point. I have been teaching Office Occupations for over twelve (12) years and have been typing for over 40 years. The inventor of the typewriter has always placed two spaces after the above punctuation marks because it usually means a pause. When a student types on this program, an error mark shows if two spaces are used. Why can't Mavis use spaces the way typists have been taught over the years. I type over 100 words per minute and do not understand why Mavis has changed the way people type. Please respond."

3,Are you glowing at me?,"This book was written over 40 years ago and that is the context I tried to put it in. You see, I was not born in that era. I can see from the story that the peace and love revolution had not hit too strong yet. The Beatles had yet to revel in their full power.This was the first time I read some of Mr. Aldiss work and I found his writting style peculiar. I did not understand all the British jokes but the sense of humor in this story is undeniable.What would happen if everyone in a prudish society was fitted with metal disc, on their forehead, that revealed their sexual feelings toward another by glowing red? I am still wondering. Anyway, Brian Aldiss has discussed the implications profoundly from different point of views in this book and that is all I wanted. Also, the story, which is not all that dramatic, was sufficient to keep me reading."
3,Middle of the road concert dvd,"This dvd does have it's moments...and I am a big fan of Porcupine Tree, but I cannot leave 5 stars just for that. The highlight of this show is the very professional drumming of Gavin Harrison. He's the only musician of the band that really blew me away in an individual sense. In a collective sense, there were a few strong tracks, but not enough to give this 5 stars. Still...if you are a fan at all, this is worth buying. I don't regret that at all!"
5,few words on 'officium',"it's a classic. of a rare kind. it grows on you. spontaneity at its most subtle and explosive all together. the choir serves as the baseline stream of consciousness over which jan plays bursts of literally glowing melodies, never static and never redundant. would like to see similar works of art."
2,Great vocals but saxophone has to go!,"This cd has extremely beautiful vocals and chants that conjure up sublime images of baronial castles, knights in armore and ornately decorated fireplaces of old. This is until Jan's 20-21st century saxophone weaves its way into this otherwise heavenly image. The sound quietly fades in out of nowhere and eventually drowns out the vocals. It then seems to meander in and out thoughout the rest of the song. If you like John Dowland meets Kenny G., this is for you. Otherwise, if you're looking for ""pure"" early music, you might want to stick with other Hilliard Ensemble music sans Mr. Garbarek."
4,Superbe,"The first time I heard that music, I was driving on one of the access bridges to Montréal, on my way to work; the ""speakerine"" fortunately gave the info about this disk. I search for a paper and pen while driving, doing so I change lane and nearly got an accident. But that night, I had the CD home. Take the test, the first note you hear ""command"" your attention and elevate you above the daily miseries of this world ; if not ,you are probably close to - 273 C."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"This recording is a joke. The saxophone completely destroys the intention of the music. While the player may be very talented in his own repertoire, he imposes his ego on this music, changing what should have been a transcendent spiritual experience into a showcase for his personal musical opinions. The out-of-balance loudness of his playing shows further disregard for the values of this music. If you have any serious interest at all in early sacred music, do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
5,Uniquely beautiful,This album is one of the most uniquely beautiful works I have ever heard. Buy it.
5,music for these (and the other) side on paradies,My dear friend Rike has choosen this music for her burial. One of the most touching musics I could ever have listened to.
3,Mixed feelings about mixed genres,"Although I enjoy listening to these recordings for their serenity and sense of magical wonder, I tend to sympathise with some of the less glowing reviewers. My favourite passages are, without a shadow of a doubt, those in which the eminent Mr Garbarek's sax is 'tacit' or, at least, 'pianissimo'. Indeed, from time to time I struggle with an impulse to shout out: ""Oh shut up, Jan, and let me listen to those wonderful singers!"" That said, the voices and the sax do sometimes synergise, though I get the distinct impression that Mr Garbarek was simply overdubbing an existing recording by the Hilliard Ensemble: he seems to be reacting to them, but not vice versa. And with more rehearsal, his notes might have been more appropriate. FINAL VERDICT: an interesting oddity, not an unmitigated success."
2,I Wish I Could be More Positive...,"...but I really hate the soprano sax played over these beautiful pieces. The singing is superb and the repertoire is rare (only one other recording of the Morales, for instance, and that is done quite differently, anent the sax).I think I would have liked it better if Garbarak had played a lower horn, like an alto or tenor sax. These pieces are about something, and I don't feel that Gabarak really knew what the texts were about and what the composers were responding to in the texts.I keep it for the exquisite ""Parce mihi Domine"" sung withoug the screeching sax."
5,"Original, Brilliant, but Flawed","I'm a big fan both of Garbarek and of ""early music"", so I bought this album with enthusiasm when it first came out a decade ago. I wasn't disappointed, but I do find it uneven. Garbarek was experimenting throughout the process of recording this work, and some of his ideas are better than others. I understand completely those who complain about the soprano sax not blending well with the vocals - there are tracks where it's just too up-front and edgy to fit into the mix. But the tracks where the sax is recorded from further away, particularly those where a tenor sax is used, are absolutely sublime. For those moments, it deserves more than 4 stars. For the moments where the soprano sax is too shrill, I'd take off a fraction of a point if I could, but if I've got to call it a ""4"" or a ""5"", I'd give it a 5."
2,"I Wish I Could be More Positive, but...","...but I really hate the soprano sax played over these beautiful pieces.

5,Works great,Worked great for the valve adjustment on my 09 Husqvarna 510 SMR. Complete kit with plenty of shims to tackle any valve jobs you will encounter.DO make sure the diameter and thickness range suits your motorcycle.
1,Disappointing,"I am currently writing a thesis about japanese tattooing traditional and modern and I bought Madame Chinchillas book as source material. I was disappointed not only with the level of inaccuracy (eg. many people in Japan have tattoos not just yakuza, they are certainly not all performed by hand, they are more often than not quietly accepted by society, she would have stayed in a ""ryokan"" not a ""ryokin"" with a ""tatami"" not a ""tata-mi"" floor, the significance of the designs extends much further than mere representations of emotions etc) but also with the level of grammatical error and superfluous use of language. Although the section on European tattoos may well have been accurate (I am no expert) I found the self-congratulatory tone and the poor english undermined my faith in the content."
5,Excellent reference to the USA's hottest food and wine scene,"Unlike any other food and wine book, NORTHWEST Food and Wine, is the most current book on the foods and wines of Washington State and Oregon. It is an easy-to-read interesting compilation of the latest in food and wine trends from the great Pacific Northwest."
5,very healing,"I find the mudra practice very healing, it does have an effect, I have found something that works for me."
4,healing mudras,The book arrived earlier than expected. It was in very good condition for a used item. The contents were what I was hoping for.
5,Quick and Effective Meditation,"I Love this book! The pictures are great and the descriptioins are very clear. This book is a wonderful tool for dealing with emotions. It gives lots of quick and easy techniques for helping the body, mind, and more. There are mudras for overcoming addictions, having patience, happiness, healing a broken heart, right speech, and many more. These are easy Kundalini yoga based meditations and mudras that are effective in just a few minutes! Check it out!"
4,Required Reading,This is a great resource. It was a necessary purchase for training in Yoga Therapy. An easy book to understand.
5,Peace to my health,"I have found new and wonderful healing techniques through Sabrina Mesko's book Healing Mudras. In my day to day life filled with stress and deadlines, her breathing and hand exercises have helped me to release these tensions and balance my life. Only a few minutes a day and I feel such relief and freedom, as if I stopped and smelled the flowers. I recommend this book to anyone feeling the overwhelming pressures of a busy life - it's visual, accessable and the results are instant. Ah, to learn how to breathe and focus again...truly a gift."
4,Thorough and attractive,"This handsome volume contains the complete text of all published ""poor Richard""s so is a particular treat for history and literature buffs. Several fine color illustrations by Rockwell enhance it and there are also witty Rockwell pen-and-ink marginalia. Worth the extra effort it took to track down this edition."
1,"Cheap sound, way overpriced","I was very surprised at how tinny and cheap these speakers are for the price they demand. I had a set of $25 speakers that were virtual head and shoulders above these things. These aren't much better than the factory standard speakers that would come with a typical desktop. They might be on par with the $15 range of speakers, in sound quality. There's virtually no bass despite their claims on the box. Everything sounds tinny and hollow, even after severe tweaking of my sound card's settings. Bottom line: If you're willing to spend this much for speakers, go with a different set. These are NOT worth the price."
3,"Ok, but it sounded a little too familiar","While I felt that the score was done quite well, and was appropriate for the pace of the film, there were lements that sounded just a little too familiar to me. The piece playing during the end credits sounded like it could have been lifted directly from Jerry Goldsmith's score for Basic Instinct. That was probably the biggest letdown for me. If you like this one, go out and get the Goldsmith score. Or just go and get the Goldsmith score. It's twice as long, and defintely as good or better than this one, in my honest opinion."
5,Golf GPS,I product is the same as the original equipment. It works great and the price was reasonable. Now I can use my GPS and enjoy my SkyCaddie.
1,DO NOT BOTHER,"The screw is way too short! Did not attach. Dealer said it wasbecause my screw hole is stripped. It is not stripped, as I stilluse the original to wall charge the Sky Caddie. So, if I want to getmy money back I have to spend another $5 to send the cable back (sofar $10 in shipping) to get $10 refund."
2,Bad Design,The design of the attachment for the charger cable which requires a small screw be put in and taken out each time you recharge is bad! It should be a plug not a screw. I had to buy this replacement and pretty confident it too will be worn out soon.
3,This screww is not longer,"I ordered this cable and the screw is not longer than the original. I'm going to a hardware store to see if they have a longer screw. The price on the cable is good, as i carved out my other one trying to get screw to go down farther, and hit some metal wires embedded. So now the unit would charge but not sync for renewal etc..."
1,Save your money and use version 6.0,"The program is buggy even after a year and is generally a waste of money if you already own an earlier version. For example, if columns of data are transferred from a spreadsheet into the program, longer columns tend to shift to the left to fill up shorter columns that occurred earlier in the spreadsheet. The programmers are aware of this but apparently do not consider it worth correcting. Also, technical support for more complex technical issues is not actually provided by Mathsoft; they simply email the company that wrote the program and when they get a response forward it on. Our lab has reverted back to version 6 to avoid the problems that we had with version 7."
1,Axum is being phased out,"Axum is being phased out and replaced by SPlus for Windows. The makers of SPlus tell me it will read Axum files, but I have not tried it myself."
2,Attractive but did not last,I had got this coffee grinder as a Christmas present. It is a very attractive grinder and I loved all of the features. I used it for a year and loved it but then it stopped working after a year and just doesn't work anymore.
1,Are you serious?!?,"I bought the unit as a gift. I gave the unit to my lover and we wanted to try it right away. We filled the grinder to the 12 cup level, selected the drip setting and pressed the power button. The unit proceeded to grind and the self timer stopped the unit. We opened the locking cover and removed the ""ground"" coffee and it was not ground very well. A 3 year-old with could have crushed the beans more thoroughly with his/her face. We figured we would run the beans through one more time to see if it just needed a little more gusto. Sorry! The unit was burned out and didn't work again. It was quite warm to the touch as well. Honestly, I won't even try to exchange it for another. I will return it and go with another brand."
5,ARTIST & TRACK LIST,"Also including Paul McCartney, Phillip Glass, and Lenny Kaye.[1] The Ballad Of The Skeletons (7:46) [2] The Ballad Of The Skeletons [edit] (4:07) [3] Amazing Grace (2:47 [4] The Ballad Of The Skeletons [clean] (7:46)"
4,fast shipping-good condition,"Book arrived in good condition. It was a little too in depth in the beginning, too many details but gave an interesting view into the bond between Elvis and Gladys. Helps to understand him a little better."
3,Delivery?,"Great!Book itself, too talky about other things instead of Elvis and Gladys. Still reading and maybe it gets better.So far, sort of boring."
3,Mother and son,The book is very interesting. Some chapters go off the topic of the book and can be difficult to follow. It is a shame the Presley family had such a short longevity but stress does that to people sometimes. God bless them.
1,You get what you pay for! Very Disappointing,"When I put the telephoto lens on my camera I cannot take a decent picture, they are all blurry and they have strange lighting effects. My camera worked much better without the lens, it didn't help distance shots at all. Frankly the telephoto lens for my Panasonic Lumix was what I was interested in and I have not had time to try the other wide angle lens. I suspect it works as well as the other one."
5,Spiritual insights explored,"""Israel: Life in the Shadow of Terror paints a personal and devastating portrait of the losses we face -- and the love we feel -- in Israel today. It is an important and enlightening collection. Compassionate, wise, and profoundly moving. Israel: Life in the Shadow of Terror will make you tearful, angry, informed, proud, inspired, and above all motivated to stand up and support Israel and the Jewish people. Absolute must reading."
4,As Advertised,"Not much to review with this one. It's exactly as described and pictured, and does a fine job of holding the fire irons :)"
2,Incomplete,"There are some things worth learning in this book. However, the characters reviewed are all postmodernists. Schrift is utterly tolerant of the lunacy most of them write. In fact, Schrift is one of the postmodernizers of Nietzsche. He wants Nietzsche to worship at the feet of Derrida along with himself. Schrift does not review, for example, Alain Finkielkraut, who is more popular in France than any of the PoMo big shots, and who does not share their opinion of Nietzsche. He ignores Julien Benda as well. And he never mentions Clement Rossett -- who had the temerity to point out that the entire movement claims to be Nietzschean, when nothing could be further from the truth. The book is selective, and suspect becasue of that."
1,NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG GIRLS,"I AM A 23 YEAR OLD MOTHER OF A 5 YEAR OLD.FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY SHE ASKED ME FOR A DIVA DOLL. WHEN I WENT TO THE STORE TO BUY ONE I LISTENED TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING, ONE DOLL SAYS ""WHICH DUDE IS PAGING ME NOW""..SO I WENT TO THE NEXT DOLL WHICH SAID ""LETS GO BOY HUNTING""...SO THEN AGAIN I WENT TO THE NEXT ONE WHICH SAID ""LETS GO FLIRT IN MY SHORT SKIRT""...I DO NOT THINK THIS APPROPRIAT AT ALL, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG GIRLS..I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND NOT BUYING THIS FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS."
5,lots of room ideas,"Although I love my other design books, with lots of descriptions and history, this book has ideas for real world adaptations of french country design (that is, for those of us in the u.s.!)"
3,It's in the fine details,"Yes, the pictures are lovely...but as one reviewer noted, one will want to go through the book several times just to see everything one missed. On my second time through, I noticed almost every photo had many books (sometimes shelves full of books)in the background. 99% of those books were titles in English. Yes, yes, I know the French speak English very well..but what are the odds that ALL the books would be in English? Wouldn't they at least own a few titles in their native language? Made me wonder where some of these homes are located and if I was truly looking at an American (or UK) home decorated in French Country style."
3,An admirable photo book,"The photos are poetic, well composed and beautifully printed. Those interested in images of Chernobyl, or in architectural photography, will find this worthwhile.However, the book contains almost no text, and this weakens it. There is no discussion of the places shown in the photographs, or what happened in each setting. There is no pairing of before and after photographs. There is no discussion of how, technically, Polidori took the photographs. I would have preferred to see all three of these things.There are other sources, of course. A recent issue of National Geographic used the 20th anniversary of the disaster as its cue to cover this ground (and with some very similar photos too). However, this was a missed chance by Polidori.Also, I found the array of photographs of little houses being reclaimed by the forest to be less interesting than Polidori probably expected. The urban photos were much more compelling."
3,"Beautiful pictures, but a bit repetitive",Would be a great book at half the asking price.Not the variety of settings I was expecting
1,mhew!,"It was a very disappointing the photos are beautiful but they lack either the artsy look or the documentary approach, the quality of the printing and the book in general is superb, but its way too repetitive, a bunch of houses being swallow by the woods, but not a single one from the inside, and the ""classic"" pictures that you can find all over the internet from inside the school and the hospital... 2 pictures of the same room from different angles followed by a third and a forth of very similar rooms, you get the idea, there is hardly any text... scratch that... there is no text if you want to see the caption of a picture you have to go to the end of the book and look for it, there are no pictures of animals or of the inhabitants... is a word... weak... google kiddofspeed instead, its better and cheaper :D"
1,Run away! Run away!,"Can a book be both overdone and underdone? Yup, this one. Digby Smith aka Otto von Pivka slapped this together to add to his pile of Nappy publications, some 50+ at this point. You wouldn't be able to guess from this book that France under Napoleon beat the crap out of everybody for 12 years and that the French cavalry had a lot to do with it. Even in France's decline the cavalry under Murat performs terrifically at Dresden, but this is not mentioned in this book. A huge amount of space goes into explaining the run up to Marengo, much of which is tangential to the subject of the title.Want to find out how the various participants' cavalries perform at Waterloo? Read Barbero's 'The Battle, a New History of Waterloo'."
2,The book is not for me,This book is an anthology of selected charges in the Napoleonic wars. I didn't really enjoy the book due to the writing style.
4,shimmering pearls,The product was of excellent quality. It's hard to tell size when ordering from the internet and the earrings were just a little smaller than I thought they would be. It didn't really matter as my granddaughter loved them and wears them proudly.
1,Earrings Not What I expected,"I purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year-old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece's wedding. When the purchase arrived, they were too small for my granddaughter. Therefore I had to return them."
2,Lost In Mongolia,"Someone gave me ""Lost in Mongolia"" as a gift, assuming that my love for the New Yorker would translate into an appreciation of Mr Friend's work. But Mr. Friend writes in that hipper-than-thou style so fashionable among young journalists these days that, frankly, I loathe. There is a self important smugness to Friend's writing that suggests a certain barrenness of Spirit, no matter how fertile the terrain he visits. As for the celebrity profile--it is a sub-genre characterized by a potent mix of fawning and gotcha sensationalism. If this is the new generation New Yorker writer, color me bereft. I'll stick with older writers for whom the life of the mind has a deeper reasonance."
3,Slick soundtrack for a private mind,"My first foray into D. Holmes' particular brand of music has been well-rewarded. I give it 3 stars cuz it seems to only be breaking the surface of something that could be much much more--but the second CD (included in all US releases, from what I can tell) offers nice variations that more than satisfy. Music that simultaneously puts you in a trance and allows you to think should always be applauded for expressing such a wonderful paradox"
4,dum di dum,Despise the horrible cover the music is surprisingly good. Not directly uplifting but not as dark and gloomy as the cover suggests. I'm surprised Holmes has only one review (now two) because this is quality music alongside darker songs of Massive Attack and Underworld. Almost everybody is gonna recognize the first song from somewhere and there is another track on the album that got slightly remixed by Kruder and Dorfmeister (sessions). I wish it would be a double album but unfortunately I have no idea what reviewer no 1 is referring to. My copy of this album came as a single cd?!
4,Nice start,"There are some brilliant tracks (No.1 with the bell and Gone) foremost, but this record is nothing to be compared with the later one ""Lets get killed"" - that is awesome record!!! But you may enjoy this one as well"
2,"Good Cover Art, Bad Album","The music on this album is boring, repetitive, and stale. Repetition wouldn't be so bad if these looped beats were better -- more danceable perhaps. A solid groove to move to is a good justification for repetition in electronic music, but this isn't really a dancefloor album. Some reviewers suggest listeners approach it as a soundtrack. Well, unfortunately, there is no movie, and there are no visual images to prop this music up. As such, the album falls flat. To be fair, there is one standout track on here, entitled ""Gone."" Holmes apparently knows its all he's got going for him, because over 1/4 of the album is ""Gone"" remixes. ""No Man's Land"" is also good, however, these two tracks can't justify the purchase in my opinion. My advice is to download mp3's of ""Slash It,"" ""Got F**ked Up Along the Way,"" or ""Minus 61 in Detroit."" If you like these tracks, you may like the album, so go for it."
2,So What Else is New?,"The book covered just about what every A-fib patient has or will go through once diagnosed. It reads like a journal with dates and personal experiences but if one is looking for insight or guidance, it just isn't here. I think one could get the same information and arrive a similar conclusions by reading the heart disease summaries on the internet."
1,Out-of-date but Very Good for It's Time,"As another reviewer (Squire ""Jim'58""), stated when this book was published in 2000 it was an engrossing story of the author searching for the best treatment for his atrial fibrillation. In the intervening years, many, many advancements in drug therapies, and surgical and ablation techniques make a cure for A-Fib a reality for many patients.According to an email from his family, E.A. Butler passed away a few years ago (his death unrelated to his atrial fibrillation). I would have liked to get his reflections about today's options for A-Fib patients, and to thank him for his early effort to help other A-Fib patients.Patti J. RyanPublisherAtrial Fibrillation: Resources for Patients (A-Fib.com) andBeat Your A-Fib: The Essential Guide to Finding Your Cure (www.beatyoura-fib.com)"
3,Review,Software difficult to use. only gives tables. you need another source to intepret the graphs/grids.
3,"Of historic interest, good; otherwise...","Graves' scholarship is somewhat lacking. Or, to be gracious, the discoveries made since this book's initial publication cast a dubious light on some of the finer details of his argument.That there are parallels between the Christ story and the stories of other religions' messiah figures is undeniable. And I'd tend to agree this proves that Jesus was one of many ""sons of God"" wandering the earth in his time period, and that the tale presented in the Bible mixed fact, fiction, and accounts from other places.But there are more accurate books detailing this process. This book's worth is largely in its historical significance."
5,Perhaps history will never be told better,"Perhaps history will never be told better than through the eye of this travelling writer (or is it a writing traveller?). Read and be awed by the staggering proportions of recent history in the vast empire that is no more, the Sovjet Union. And be chilled to the bones by the unimaginable amounts of suffering inflicted by the sovjet leaders on their own people. And be astonished that in the midst of the most utter despair, poverty, and enslavement, Kapuscinski can find optimism, humor, and love of life."
4,Flying through the night,"Remember Erasure? You know, the guys that made ""Chains of Love""? Well, they've been quiet for a while now, which may or may not have to do with the fact that lead singer Andy Bell has been living with HIV for the past six years. But the duo still persevered with their latest, Nightbird.A lot of the other reviewers seem to love ""Breathe"". That IS a good song, but my personal favorite would have to be the song that precedes it, ""Let's Take One More Rocket to the Moon"". The haunting ""I Broke It All In Two"" is also stellar; and ""Sweet Surrender"" and ""Don't Say You Love Me"" really dig back into their `80s heyday (check out the nice vibraphone in the latter).I do hope Andy's health gets better, but whatever the case, Nightbird is a very smooth album from the group. Pick it up.Anthony Rupert"
5,Beautifully written and executed,"I have been a fan of Erasure for a very long time. I admit I wasn't impressed with their last two releases. Nightbird is a refreshing addition to my Erasure collection. Andy Bell's voice is breathtaking and in top form. The single ""Breathe"" is like velvet, and gives me chills each time I hear it. There are songs to dance to such as ""All This Time Still Falling Out of Love"", or ""I'll be there"". I highly recommend listening to it first with headphones, Vince Clarke is really a master at what he does. Way to go boys! I love Nightbird!"
4,Another Strong Album from Erasure,"If you like their albums from the 80s and 90s, you will like this one as well. It's like newly discovered music from the 80s. Very good."
4,allmost perfect,"I did not epect this album to be as good considering last few releases form Erasure. But they came back vary strong, simply by recycling their 80""s souns. There is very little that band that has been around for so long can can do now. They are not young anymore and pop music is not really that in anymore. The only way was to reaqch back to their core audience. Their original fans. The idea has paid off quite well.Nothing new and nothing earth shathering. Simplya strong well arranged album. Erasure is back in great form. Sales of this album as well as sold out concert halls across Europe and USA speak for it's self. I also suspect that Erasure decided wiyth the recycled 80's souns also use some of the 80 machinery used then to produce their electronica sound.My favorite numbers on this album are 8, 2, 10 and my most favorite song on this album is I bet you are mad at me which also the final song on this cd. It is a definite must for every Erasure fan."
1,second-hand and too wet,"It actually is of little importance to a listener how long and why this outfit kept in the shade. This album will, for all we know, put them away for longer still. Reason is a-plenty. To begin with, neo-romantic synhty-pop is not quite making hey these days. The material smacks of Wet Wet Wet's heydays. And anyway, this sort of nagging suicidal gloom is too much to bear in A-ha, Weeping Willows, Doves and the entire Glitterhouse label's output. On the plus side we have here 11 cute and crafty tune arrangements - but then again, vaguely reminiscent of 80's new wave era which Erasure never failed to subscibe to. Wake up, little Suzie, wake up!"
4,A Pleasure As Always,"Erasure have been Andy Bell and Vince Clark for a long time now. It amazes me to see a band indure nearly as long as U2 in these Rap/RnB times. Erasure returns to new material after their last album ""Other People's Songs"" covers. Never straying from the synth-pop path, Andy still sounds like an angel. Why not five stars? Well even the best can go a bit wrong sometimes. Admittedly there are times when a song or two won't sit too well, but hey thats ok! Erasure has been around so long that mistakes are easy to forget. I have nearly their entire discography and I can say good and bad about every album. Erasure is easy to listen to. They aren't around to make a huge polictal change, or to insult a certain group of people. They are simply here to make music for everyone to listen to. Take a moment to enjoy Erasure. It's a great choice."
5,Dreamy and Poetic love songs!,"This band has been one of my favorites since the 1980s. I feel this is their most steamlined and grown up albums to date. Andy Bell's voice is very honest and his lyrics match. I am sorry that other reviewers dont feel this way. Perhaps a second listen to this 2nd best work behind Cowboy.Cowboy was more playful and danceable. Nightbird is more serious and urgent in it intent. The tracks are powerful and subtle. This a grown up Erasure. ""Here I Go Impossible Again"" and ""Breath"" are my personal favorites. The record gets a little slow in parts. Then so does true love and devotion.I am a real fan after all these years. One should give it a try if there is a need for a return to your roots of real Euro style techno."
4,Classic Erasure with a more grown up sound.,"This time around Erasure has once again stepped away from campy pop and created a solid recording. If you like OMD, you'll love ""Don't Say you love me"". It has vibe of OMD's ""Locomotion"". Breathe is a very solid track with some great back rhythms (listen with headphones). They also brought back some of thier earlier sounds w/ ""All this time..."" has the energy of ""Victim of Love"" but much more cleaner & ""I'll be there"" is very reminiscent. Though a lot of fans don't like Erasures earlier album ""Loveboat"". I believe it's a classic and with Nightbird and Chorus, they are thier best ventures. Don't expect a super poppy album that you will get bored with fast, Nightbird is an aquired taste but a tasted the will keep you coming back."
4,I am soooo happy!!,"Well another Erasure album, Finally!! After Loveboat, I was beginning to have my doubts - although I do put it on at parties (I play Erasure all the time: parties, the car, other friend's homes, drives them crazy). I am not going to say which track on Nightbird is my favorite, yet. It always takes a while for the full ""effect"" to set in. Sort of like Chorus - where ""When love turns to Anger"" and ""Home"" are still some of the songs that pop into my head occasionally. What can I say? Thank you boys!!!!!!"
