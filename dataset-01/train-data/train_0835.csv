5,just as funny as I thought,"When The Royal Tenenbaums came out I knew I had to buy it. It had an amazing cast including my two favourite actors (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson) and it had a few others I also thought were really funny (Gene Hackman, Gwenyth Paltrow). From the opening scene I knew this was going to be one of my favourite movies and it was. It's packed with laughs and witty jokes. A must buy for anyone who likes comedy movies."
5,on constant repeat,"wes anderson's attention to detail is dizzying. from the set props and details to the costumes to the soundtrack - everything fit together so perfectly it seemed completely believable. the shot compositions are beautiful, especially the family shots with gwynneth paltrow always cowering in the corner. one of my favorite movies ever - it's hilarious."
3,Doesn't Quite Work Either as Comedy or Drama,"Despite its generally favorable reviews, neither my wife nor I really liked this movie. It isn't funny enough to work as a comedy, and you don't care enough about any of the characters for it to work effectively as a drama. The central character, Royal Tenenbaum, is mean and manipulative, and his three grown children are all neurotic messes. Hackman and Huston give decent performances, but the script is disjointed and the ""chapter introductions"" are annoying. Not the worst movie ever, but somewhere in the bottom half."
1,Terribly Unfunny,Perhaps the most formulaic and unfunny comedy I've ever seen. I did not laugh during the last hour. Paltrow is terrible.
1,A great time to take a snooze!,"This is called a comedy? This movie would be outstanding if it were used only for the purpose of putting people to sleep. I can not believe with this many big name actors and actresses that a movie could be this boring, awful, and most of all not funny. Trust me, do not buy this movie. It is not worth one kernel of popcorn."
1,Dreadful picture,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was a terrible waste of the talents of a great cast that included Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow.The movie got worse and worse as it went along. I am someone who finds it easy to laugh and enjoy a film, however I didn't laugh once during the entire movie. I would have stopped watching it early on, but I had to watch the entire movie to see if it would contain anything of value, but it never did.If you want to waste your money, lighting it with a match would make more sense than buying this video."
1,Indescribably Bad,"This movie bumped ""Spring Break"" from my top 3 worst films of all time (""Boxing Helena"" being #1 and ""Showgirls"" being #2).It's not even worth 1 star..but that's as low as the ratings here go."
1,This film is a comedy ?,"What a waste of talent, a great cast, a terrible film.I thought this film was a comedy, i didn't laugh once!I checked the cover to make sure this was supposed to be a comedyIf you want to waste 2hours of your life , go ahead and watch this film.You want to see comedy? grab a copy of the Simpsons Halloween specials."
1,Disappointing,One of the most disappointing films I've seen. I kept watching for some humor and it never developed. A waste of precious time.
1,Hollywood's attempt at being artsy,"Hollywood rarely makes a good artsy film, and this one is not one of the rare ones. The movie is packed with mediocre to good actors who give a good effort , yet are inable to bring it all together. I think the problem is that they are all forced to take on roles which are not within their usual strong areas and they all failed miserably despite their good efforts. Take a pass on this one, it's not worth the almost two hours of your life you will spend on it."
1,THE ROYAL BOREDOM,"GOOD FORTUNE DID NOT SHINE ON ME THE NIGHT I SAW THIS MOVIE.I CHOSE THIS FILM BECAUSE THE FILM I WANTED TO SEE WAS SOLD OUT.AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO ADD ANOTHER NOTCH IN MY BELT OF WORSTMOVIES EVER MADE. THE DIRECTOR AND THE CAST ASIDE, EXTRAORDINARYFILMS ARE SUCH BECAUSE OF EXTRAORDINARY SCRIPTS, TO WIT:THE SWEET SMELLOF SUCCESS. NO SUCH LUCK HERE. THE STORY WAS NEITHER COMEDIC,TRAGIC,ENLIGHTENING, NOR INCISIVE. WITH THIS ALBATROSS OF A SCRIPT,THE FILM'S FAILURE WAS PREDESTINED. I SELDOM WALK OUT OF A THEATERDURING A FILM BUT THIS MONSTROSITY PROVIDED THE IMPETUS NEEDED TOGO SCREAMING INTO THE NIGHT. IT TAKES A BRAVE PERSONTO RETURN TO THE MOVIES AFTER THIS FAILED EFFORT."
2,"Occasionally Amusing, But Too Damned Cute For Its Own Good","Like Anderson's earlier Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums is a film filled to overflowing with cute little ideas and grace notes and witty little moments. Unfortunately, it is working so hard being cute and graceful and witty that it never really takes off. The film never really comes together into a consistent, engaging whole for me. It just kind of wanders from cute little thing to cute little thing to cute little thing to cute little thing. I was ready to move on long before the final credits started, ever so cutely, to roll."
1,Just not up to it,"It must be my taste in films, but this movie was drudgery to watch. I like the work of Hackman, especially lately with Under Suspicion, The Heist, and Heartbreakers. I like the work Paltrow and Huston have done. Bill Murray and Danny Glover _can_ be great, but the material here is so tediously presented, I thought I was watching a Kevein Smith film.Eccentric characters are fine, but these people are not just unlikeable and disfunctional, they're vapid, which is inexcusable in a big screen film. Not to mention, this subject has been much better handled in I'm Losing You, which has wonderful humor and emotional power.In the vernacular, I give it a thumbs down."
2,Where disc 2 is better than disc 1,"THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a movie you want to like because of the talent it contains - Angelica Huston, Gene Hackman, Gweneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson. Nice to see a widely accepted movie that is off the beaten track. But the story is ultimately boring and what can be gleaned from the script is placed in capable hands, unsuccessfully. The accompanying disc about the movie is actually more enjoyable to watch. This is just another ho-hum drab bit of Hollywood trying not to be Hollywood. And who made the decisions about the classical music worked into the sound track???"
2,Wow this was bad,"This is one of those comedies where it's so bad, but you really want to enjoy it, so you force yourself to chuckle even though you don't find anything funny. Gene Hackman was the only light in this slow, dark, dull, depressing movie. Two attempted suicides in a comedy? I found all of the characters disturbing and in need of serious therapy and medication. What's with Ben Stiller and that ugly red sweat suit he's got on 24/7? And if that's not bad enough he's got his kids in them too. This movie really was a waste of time."
1,worst movie ever,"This movie [stinks]!!!!! now I'm normaly a guy that is a not a very harsh grader but I hated this movie. Now I am saying nothing bad about the actors. They just weren't right for this film, no actor is. I thought that such a great team of big named actors would make a great movie, it seems that they spent so much money on the actors that there was none left for a deceint plot.This movie was almost two hours, it felt more like two years. I Layed on the couch wondering how much longer till this awful was over. If there was a lower grade then one star I would give it negative. I pity the sole of those who watch it."
5,So funny!,"My husband hates it, but I'm getting him drunk to see if he likes it....again. I love it. The humor is dry, but brilliant. Great actors."
1,Innovative Comedy Forgoes Humor,"Let's have Ben Stiller's character and his kids run around in 80s style jogging suits. That'll be funny.It's not. It's merely odd, which is about the best thing I can say for the film as a whole."
1,The Royal Suckenbaums,"I'm going to spare the wrath on this one cause it's not worth my time, or yours. This thing just landed in my top 10 worst of all time list and is closer to the top than Billy the Kid Meets Dracula. I'm still looking for the humor in this pig, subtle as it may be. My girlfriend was relieved to find a family as dysfunctional as her's so she thought it was funny. My son was humored by the painted face mescalined-out Austin Healey crashing thing. I was mostly irritated by it all.If the popularity of this movie is not proof positive that Armageddon is near then Jackass surely is! And Gene, why the hell would you care that you might lose Anjelica Houston? Seems cause for celebration to me. 1 Prozac"
1,We've been royally screwed.,"I can't believe I got suckered into watching this movie, looking forward to it as if it was going to be some intelligent and witty movie. This is just one more example of a movie that is loved by critics because of its quirkyness, but in fact is really just a boring and unfunny movie. If a movie is viewed in a forest, and nobody laughs, can you still call it a comedy? Don't waste your time on this movie. Go ahead and watch Father of the Bride again or When Harry Met Sally."
1,The Royal Tenenbaums - Criterion Collection,"Unfortunately, there are no negative star ratings, if there where, I would give this movie -5. This is the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. It's awful, un-entertaining and a complete waste of money."
2,"So many great actors, so little for them to do","'Tenenbaums' starts out slowly, and for the most part maintains its plodding pace throughout the whole -- well, I guess it was really less than an hour and a half, but it felt like more.This film is trying to do too much and be too many things, and it succeeds at none of them. It is nearly impossible to care about most of the characters, because they don't really become characters: they're sketches, caricatures, without any depth or substance. Even though only Eli is really on drugs, everyone in the cast seems to be -- particularly Richie and Margot, who seem to have had all of their affect surgically removed.Don't waste your money or your time: there are lots of better films out there."
4,The Royal Tenenbaums Is Fit For A King,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a hilarious and oringinal comedy , about a man who pretends to be ill of stomach cancer to spendmore time with his family . The Royal Tenenbaums stars Gene Hackman , Anjelica Houston , Ben Stiller , Gwenyth Paltrow ,Luke Wilson , Owen Wilson , Danny Glover , Bill Murray , andis narrated by Alec Baldwin."
2,Interesting but ultimately disappointing.,"Hmm.I was psyched to see this,as I'd loved director Wes Anderson's 2 previous films-RUSHMORE and BOTTLE ROCKET.To me,this film didn't come close to matching the sweetness and wonderful craft of the others.Instead it appears to be a well-intentioned,yet a little typical,quirky family drama.The sort that wins oscars for acting and that's about it.RT has a great starting off point but bungles it."
2,A movie with nowhere to go,"This film has two excellent performances by Gene Hackman and Anjelica Houston. Danny Glover is also good in a not-very-demanding role. But mostly this picture is a waste of good talent. The director/writer could not make up his mind whether he was making a soap opera, a true drama, or a spoof. Nor could he decide what to do with the plot. I went with my grown son, and we decided half way through that this movie was going nowhere. Our main pleasure thereafter was spotting the locations in New York, the beloved city where we live."
5,Acting it Out,"To be honest with all of you who read this, I am not that knowledgeable about what makes a film good or not (aside from whether or not I liked it). I am, however, kind of an actor (meaning I love to do it, but am not that great), but I have been around good actors a lot. To get to my point I find the acting in Royal Tenenbaums to be amazing. I thought their reactions fit their characters to a T. They reacted not as they might in real life, but as their characters (with their unique background) would. I do not know about camera angle or dark humor (although I did find it humorous); I give it Five stars because I think that the acting (and the writing) were really were amazing."
5,Not SUPPOSED to be a LOL comedy,"After perusing the other reviews of this great, great film, I've discovered that many folks went into this expecting ""Shanghai Noon"" or something of that ilk. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" is a quirky, subtle film that isn't going to play as comedy for most people. Is it strange? You bet! This is a great film for those of us who are sick of seeing the ""same old, same old"" in movies. Wes and Owen's script is smart and touching, and as always with Wes's films the production design is fabulous. Here's a barometer for you: If you like fairy tales, if you like the great subtle films of the 1970's (many of which featured Gene Hackman, as well), you will probably enjoy ""The Royal Tennenbaums."""
1,"If you must see it ""RENT DON'T BUY'","If they had a Zero rating I would have chosen that. This movie is up with the Killer Tomato's list , wait! Killer Tomato's was much better. I fell asleep after ten minutes waiting for the funny ""stuff"" to begin, my husband stopped the movie and took it back and we don't always agree on things,this we did, Movie STINKS"
1,Strike one,"I worship BOTTLE ROCKET, Wes Anderson's first movie. I love RUSHMORE, his sophomore effort. Both are witty, innocent, sincere movies which snub their nose at slackerdom and everyhing blaise. The moral in both of those movies was it's not whether you succeed. It's to do everything with gusto, verve and panache.But this movie, number three? More like ""number two."" What on Earth were Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson thinking when they made this one? To quote from Magnus, the hilarious Scottish bully in RUSHMORE, this one's ""all show and no results.""Anderson spends nearly the first half of the movie showing off with mannered, show-offy flash back sequences very much like the priceless yearbook montage in RUSHMORE. That's a great one minute scence. But in this movie, Anderson beats the joke into the ground. This movie never picks up steam. And the characters are so two dimensional.So for now, I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hoping Anderson's next outing proves more worthwhile."
1,THIS MOVE [DISAPPOINTS],THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE ! DEFINATLY NOT FUNNY OR ENETERTAINING IN ANY WAY ! DONT RENT OR BUY THIS. BEN STILLER IS USUALLY HILARIOUS BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.
1,A waste of talent,"No sense of irony, no humor either...eccentricities, maybe. This movie is pointless, plain boring, a waste of talent. If seduced by the vast cast of well-known actors, believing their performance can save this ill-scripted movie, don't."
1,saves on nytol,This looked like a comdey. What a waste of all those big names. I hope these kind of esoteric artsy movies wont become a trend. I couldnt bear to finish this watching this disaster.
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * *,"The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)Who would like this? : quirky comedy fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : no-rent it : yesCast:Gene HackmanBen StillerGwyneth PaltrowAnjelica HustonLuke WilsonDanny GloverOwen WilsonBill Murray________________Wes AndersonDirector* you decicide whether this is quirky in a good way or in a bad way. Excellent quality dvd from Criterion, by the way."
5,"If you liked Magnolia, run-don't walk-to the theater","There is so much subtlety, finesse and detail in this film, there's no way to cover all its delights. Yes, Tennenbaums has obviously been compared to Rushmore, but I found it more ""Magnolia-esque"" in humor and almost as artistically filmed as Vertical Ray of the Sun. It's fun in the most pure and rude form. Don't miss it!!"
5,Great Movie!!!!,"The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time. It is a character sudy about a family that over the years has grown apart. Every aspect of this movie is absolutely perfect especially the casting and the way music is made to fit perfectly with the scenes in the movie. There are some funny moments, but none of the plot has been sacrificed for cheap laughs. If you liked Rushmore you will love this movie. Just don't expect a comedy like the trailers suggest."
5,Did you pack your bags before you got locked out?,Great film. I love watching movies with dysfunctional family dynamics. I wish I had their house. It's so cool!! Hilarious!
5,Best movie I've seen this year - don't miss it!,"Very worth owning, very worth watching again and again and again. The soundtrack is wonderful, too!"
1,Worst Movie,This was absolutely the worst movie I had ever seen. Save yourself the time and aggravation. The only thing that was funny on this movie was that I actually rented it.
1,Weird................................,Didn't like at all...... very weird movie...... one of the worse... sorry that I wasted my money on such a movie....
1,oy!,"this movie was so lame! just about everyone that was watching it with me fell asleep! they spent all the money on the actors and no money on the script! there's no plot, and its full of stupid characters doing stupid boring things. the only way you could ever get me to watch this again is if you paid me! i wish i'd never seen it in the first place, dont get this movie! save you money, like they did with the script!"
3,i was disappointed,"maybe it was just that i was watching this on a cross-Atlantic flight, but i didnt really like this film as much as i did Rushmore, Wes Anderson's last one, which was very very good. Gene Hackman and all the other actors were good, but i think the script needed a little help."
1,Dry and dumb humor.,I went to go see this movie thinking it would be great. It had gotten so many great reviews. I found that the humor was dry and it just wasn't funny. An hour into this movie many people started to leave. I left a little after that realizing how boring the movie was. I know that a lot of people like this film but I couldn't see why they did.
1,Too much talent for a very boring movie.,"With such a great line up of wonderful, talented stars it was the most boring and laughless comedy I had the misfortune of paying to see."
1,Most depressing,"The Royal Tennenbaums is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was advertised like a comedy and has an incredible amount of great actors in it. Well, I took my 26 year old daughter to see it, hoping to cheer her up ( she was suffering from depression ), well, guess what - that movie was a disaster. I don't recommend it. It doesn't deserve a star. Could you come up with a negative rating system, please ?"
2,"Why, O Why, Did I see a Movie Like This?",There's only one reason why I give this movie two stars: the acting was good. My friends and I were laughing at this flick the whole time. The moral message is extremely offensive - there is even incest between two of the characters - and the screenplay suffers from one major flaw: it bores the viewer to death.
1,terrible,"the only movie I've seen at a theater that I couldn't finish. If you hated any of the other ""if you like this check out this"" movies then you should also hate this movie, as they are similarly not funny. I can't believe so many people enjoyed this movie, but most probably hate every movie I find funny. I'm just glad I have great friends that also hated this movie enough to leave before it ended."
1,Who? What? Where? When? Why?,"This movie is a totally bizarre pile of boring crap. I saw the Rushmore movie years ago and thought it was a great story with great acting, but this is such a far fetched story line with lame weirdo characters. The movie takes place in New York during the 60's 70's or 80's, im not even sure and the characters are so boring and dysfunctionally weird. The actors act as if they are being held against their will to act in this movie. Also the stupid character gag that the actors look exactly the same when they are young as they do when they get older (same clothes, hair styles, etc.) is so far fetched. The story itself is cluttered and impossible to follow. Furthermore, the characters are always miserable about nothing, just because their father left them when they were younger, GET OVER IT ALREADY!! which in turn makes the audience feel miserable as well."
1,Please deliver me from pretentiousness,"...In their zeal to create truly ""quirky"" characters, the writers seemed to throw everything at the audience from wooden fingers to exercise suits. The film was packed with gimmicks to try to endear this family to us. They were contrived and not clever or funny for the most part. The cigarette lobby must have dropped a few bucks on the production of this clunker..."
4,oh criterion,"i dont understand the criterion collection aside from being overpriced, but i must say, i love wes andersonhe is not a director that all can watch though - slow and lengthy films = if you love him you love him, but there is no grayif you have never seen one of his films, i would suggest rushmore as a first dip into the movies of anderson"
5,"Hillarious, Intelligent, Quirky","The Royal Tenenbaums is a very rare film, the perfect blend of Wes Anderson's unique style with some of the best talent in Hollywood. While the movie is definitely open to criticism, I find the family dynamics to be scarily reminiscent to my own--minus the adopted Margot thread. A film about my family is sure to have a limited audience, since most people don't care about the same things we care about. However, if you're willing to look about some of Anderson's randomness, the heart of his film is very powerful and had me laughing more than any other film of recent memory."
3,Good Dark Humor,"This movie started off as a dark, obscure but funny comedy that kept me interested. Owen and Luke Wilson are just too much, they make me laugh, and if you add in Ben Stiller, you have enough comedy to make many movies work.Some issues with the movie: Although the comedy remained throughout, the suicide attempt and some other dark parts pushed this movie towards just plain out there.Positives: Trying new things, the dialogue between Owen and Luke Wilson was absolutely brilliant. The scene where they are on opposite ends of the room and pretend to say nothing, was absolutely hillarious.Overall, grade of ""B"""
4,Great Cast!,"This movie had everything to offer. I am so impressed by the ensemble cast. Gene Hackman was so credible as ""Royal"", Angelica Huston as ""Ethaline"" was just that sort of Mother that reminded me of ""Carol Brady"". I found myself rooting for Royal in his desire to become closer to his family. The Kids were Hilarious ((smile)) you have got to watch every scene though. This isn't one of those you can get up and come back and pick it right up where it left off, if you leave the room you probably missed something. I know there are many reviews on here about this so I won't go into a long winded display of accolades but I will say the DVD is worth it there are interviews and lots of other ""quirky"" extras that most will enjoy. I found this movie to be bizarringly funny, poignent moments and tearful situations. I was laughing throughout the movie and sniffling at various parts, which to me says it was good at many levels."
5,One of my favorites!,I won't even care if there was a story (and there is) I just think these are some of the best characters I have watched. Great great movie and so funny too.
5,A brilliantly quirky comic dramedy,"The Royal Tenenbaums is not a film which most people will find funny or entertaining.It's meant for those few really wierd filmgoers who just happen to be on the look out for that ellusive,magical, but offbeat and quirky little film.Well, The Royal Tenebaums is THAT films.With brilliant performances all around,a sharp,engaging script, and deliciously quirky sets,costumes and characters, The Royal Tenenbaums is a truly wonderful piece that takes a few viewings to truly appreciate, and take in all the little subtleties that make a film truly magical.It's a film that needs to be seen to be appreciated for its dry wit and whimsical qualities.Its a film that is a sheer joy to watch if you're a fan of movies that are slightly different."
1,"Could have been Funny, but somehow missed.","This is one of those rare movies that is so full of talent I honestly don't think the producers knew how to handle it. Just look at it... It's a cast of ""who's hot in Hollywood."" But for me, as much as I tried to watch this movie and find the humor in it, it just missed.Look at the cover. That's about as funny as it gets. I hate to sound so negative, but if you're a Hackman fan, this isn't his best... if you want to see Ben Stiller being funny, rent ""Meet the Parents."" If you want to see Owen Wilson being funny, rent ""Shanghai Noon."" If you want to see Bill Murray being funny, rent ""Kingpin."" In this movie, this wonderful cast just never clicks.My advice would be to watch it when it comes out on regular cable... Trust me... you can wait!Sorry! Only one star!"
2,A bit pretentious prehaps?,"Although it's packed with talented actors and actresses, this film just misses the mark and is extremely boring, boring, boring. While I like good witticisms as much as the next person, this film is tied up with trying to be witty it forgets to be funny. Because there is so much talent in the cast, I can only assume the directer and screenplay writer are morons. I recommend NOT seeing this movie, it's like watching paint dry as it trys painfully to be funny. I gave my copy away after watching it."
1,Bearer of bad tidings...,"Well, everyone wants to talk about the characters... The only character worth his paycheck in the farce of a film is Mr. Pagoda. Literally, the only thing that struck me as humorous about this film was the story about Pagoda stabbing Gene Hackman and then taking him to the hospital to save his life. Then, Pagoda proceeds to stab him again during the film. That, and the fact that Pagoda was the only character with an ounce of wits about him makes him the only character worth caring about in this film.Instead of ranking this movie as a comedy, it should be labeled ""Delusional Genius Movie"". The only people I know that liked this film are people that ""think"" they are sooooooo smart and above the run of the mill ""dysfunctional family"" comedies. If you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at, take a pass on this one."
2,A Pale Imitation of Masterworks,"I went into this film with high hopes . . . good writers, great cast. I came away feeling utterly cheated by what apepared to be nothing more than a poor effort to capture the essence of what is present in John Irving's novels and the subsequent film adaptations. Get iGarp, Hotel New Hampshire, and Cider House Rules to and see how this type of humor works when done right.I will, however, give them credit for the gypsy cab gag."
1,So Bad We walked out,"Royal Tenenbaums is one of the two movies I have walked out of in 10 years. I am a frequent movie goer as is a friend of mind and we both agreed this was a horrible, grossly over rated film.Gene Hackman was very good and may be the only reason to consider going to this movie. The theater we were at had a good croud and you almost never heard a laugh at any time. It was more like a morgue.For normal movie fans this is a bomb!"
2,A Royal One,"""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a movie best appreciated by anyone fascinated, as Wes Anderson obviously is, by just how many different THINGS there are in the world. The film is crammed to the rafters with Stuff, everything from board games to boar's heads. Anderson's packrat mentality helped make ""Rushmore"" fun to look at, but in ""Tenenbaums"" it gets the better of him, spilling over and defining his relationship with his characters. There are no human beings in the movie. Yes, actors occupy sets, wear costumes, say lines. Sometimes they smoke cigarettes. But they have no more inner flame than the knick-knacks poised to engulf them. Symmetrical framing, used effectively in ""Rushmore"", takes on a creepy, compulsive air: in practically every shot, these Glass wanna-bes look like objects carefully arranged on a shelf. Angelica Huston, at least, manages to invest her role with a fluttery vulnerability, but she's operating in a vacuum.Dig out that copy of ""Franny and Zooey"" instead."
1,Is Boring an adequate description ?,So slow that I wanted to turn it off all the time.I gave it a whole hour and it never picked up
5,beauty to behold,"Right from the beginning,Wes Anderson sets the tone for a slice of life not far from your next door neighbor.From the brilliant screenwriting,set designs and superb casting to the last details of the dvd packaging.In Eli Cash`s words ""I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum"" in which Royal replies ""so did I""Here Here!!!!"
2,THOROUGHLY UNIMPRESSED IN DALLAS,"Other than seeing the faces of some of my favorite actors and appreciating their ability to act within the limited scope of this script, I was struggling to keep awake in this film. What did keep me awake was the optimistic hope that good actors would only be involved in this movie if it were entertaining in some way at some point. Perhaps it was just not at all my cup of tea. Little plot, action, development. It reminded me of the television show: ""Married with Children"" in its level of humor. Frankly, I thought that the concept was good, but not developed well. I felt like asking for a refund. As a regular fan of Hollywood's best movies, I admit that I, like others, have been sorely disappointed in most of the 2001 releases."
2,WIERD!!!,"Went into this movie thinking it would keep me laughing. Well, it didn't! There are a lot of well known actors in this, but it fails to produce the laughs. The storyline is disjointed, and quirky. The film is shot in documentary style format. I sat through the film, and just kept saying ""how wierd"". It was a big let down. Save your $8.00 and go to another movie!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Ditto ""Major Disappointment""","Too many players and little development led to less than empathetic roles, a wasted celebrity cast, and uneven pacing. (Think Anniversary Party.) Introduction of new and unsubstantiated character dysfunction (e.g., celeb writer's substance abuse 3/4 through the movie) does not equal a plot twist. For a how-to on multiple character development, try Short Cuts or Magnolia.Most of the humor was found in the movie's opening montage (similar to Max Fisher's extracurricular activities in Rushmore). And the most beautiful cinematography, the moments before Wilson's suicide attempt, seemed out of place, despite the movie's billings as a dark comedy. Also disappointing was Hackman's racism towards Glover (a la Nicholson's character in As Good As It Gets). Gratuitous racism died with Quentin Tarantino's 15 minutes of fame.For a look at why critics rave about Wes Anderson, watch Rushmore."
3,This movie is worth watching but don't buy it.,"When I saw ads for this film it was portrayed as a comedy. From the beginning I realized this wasn't the comedy I was expecting. I must admit I did laugh at certain points, but overall, I guess I'm just a sucker for slapstick. Although, I was disappointed with the lack of laughs, the movie was redeemed by its dramatic climax.I do recommend this film, but don't buy it. Rent it, Borrow it but don't buy it. It's worth viewing, but it will not be needed in your home video collection."
4,great great movie,"this is the kind of movie you'll watch over and over again, finding things you missed each time. I highly recommend this to anyone who hates having their humor spoon-fed to them."
1,Total Waste of Time,"I truly love almost all of the stars that are in this movei ... but the movie ...! I kept thinking ""I have to watch it to the end, because with this high quality cast, it HAS to get better"" ... IT DIDN'T! Don't wast your time...ick!"
5,Rock Me Tonight,This is the best Gene Hackman movie i have ever seen. Usually Ben Stiller and the Wilson brothers usaully do stupid and childish movies. Danny Glover is a bit dissapointing though. Alec Baldwin does everyone a favor and just narrates the the film. So all and all this film flows like wine.
2,the mice were even better in Babe,"Someone here said that the mice were the comic highlight of the movie. I could agree with him on that. However, there were much better mice actors in Babe. And if I wanted a movie with humor so dry and inane to make me laugh, I'd go watch Babe a hundred times over the Royal Tennenbores. Dry wit, they say? It seemed more like Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson were like high school nerds snickering all to themselves because they shared a joke that no one else could get."
2,Too complicated,"I don't know if im too stupid or this movie is too complicatedbut it definitely is not a movie that the whole familycan sit down and watch,,...many parts are funny but some parts are even little dipressing"
1,...Doesnt Even Deserve That 1 Star,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever saw in my lifetime, maybe I dont get it but I wasnt the only one who thought it [was bad]. I couldnt wait for the movie to end. I cant believe how they got all those good actors and just made that movie terrible. there was a stupid plot and the movie was complete nonsense. WASTE OF FILM"
2,"man, you're blowing it.","why, why, why???with all the rumors that criterion is coming out with the TRT and BR dvds, and then this? poor form.i'm sick of the dvd comps putting out these barebones versions of movies, selling them for 20+, and then coming out with special editions months (or years) later.well, anyay, you won't find me buying this version unless it's uber cheap somewhere. i've gotta hold out for the good stuff."
1,"Blah, ugh and fooey","It's certainly true, as some of the reviews say, that this movie is not for everyone. I thought it was UNBELIEVABLY pretensious, boring, weird (and I like New Yorker cartoons, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, etc.). The performances were good, but in a vacuum. The jokes fell flat and the pseudo-intellectual tone just didn't work. Yuk."
1,What is it with these movies?,"These should be a new genre for all the wierd movies popping up like this...I bought this movie a few years ago, and could not even sell it in a garage sale, so I am still stuck with it. I HATE this movie. It has such an all-star cast- but it's awful.What is with these movies? I mean, do people honestly find these dry, awkward, pointless, trite comdies (with no funny parts) any good?It's a waste of film.....and nothing special."
1,Hated it.,"I get it. It's trying to be a deadpan, quirky movie about a dysfunctional family. It just isn't NEARLY as good as the pretentious people out there would have you believe. Arrested Development does the same thing but with WAY more interesting characters and humour that never misses the mark."
3,it's not rushmore but it's still got hackman,so..the title is basically the jist...it doesn't have the cute absurdity of rushmore...this one is more absurd for absurdity's sake...but it's still mouthfuls better than the typical cloying hollywood films out there. So rent her...she's a nice sunday flick....just don't want it to be the movie before it.
5,Different that the rest,"Love it or hate it, this movie is different. Personally I was not in love with Bottle Rockets or Rushmore, I liked both, nit did not love them. This movie really presses you to expand your views on film. You have to see this movie a few times to truly understand all of the things going on in it.This movie, as described below, is an experience. You should not try to analyze the characters, and try to figure it out as you are watching it the first time."
4,You will probably hate this movie.,"Totally self-indulgent, and totally engrossing -- for those of a certain temperament. Probably easiest to describe as ""quirky"", though that doesn't do it justice. For me, it was like the back story you might envision for a painting, not specifically leading to a definitive ending; more like a sensation of a life and it's events. You may identify with a sense of the absurd, densely layered with character portraits that seem like caricatures, yet intensely familiar. It didn't coalesce as completely as Rushmore, but then I don't know that it was meant to. Individuals with absurdly dysfunctional family histories are probably guaranteed a connection with this film. The soundtrack is superb to boot."
4,Gene Hackman + Anjelica Houston + Danny Glover + Bill Murray,"You cannot lose with this combination! And that is just the veterans... Gwyneth, Luke & Owen Wilson, and Ben Stiller make this a MUST watch for a ""feel good"" really funny movie.Normally, once I watch a movie, I am done with it. This one is always funny and always entertaining."
5,Hotel New Hampshire meets any Peter Greenaway movie...,"I loved it. The movie definitely has a heart.The performances were measured and precise and wonderful. Each actor was consistent, this was no Disney/Spielberg 'lets all make up by the end of the movie' movie, this was truly heartful.Gwyneth Paltrow was excellent, so was Bill Murray. I don't want to just gush. See this movie."
5,one for the ages,"i have seen both previous wes anderson/owen wilson movies and loved them. rushmore was my all time favorite movie ever. i went to see the royal tenenbaums two days ago with my mother and my brother. i loved it it has been one of the best movies ive seen all year. i went again the next day to see it again with my friend richie. i had to share the feeling i got after seeing it. it had the same whit and charm as the two previous movies but it also had a sad, sort of depressing feel to it that really lets you sink into the movie. the soundtrack is a masterpiece and recommended for anyone who liked the movie. i hope this influences you to go se it. im 16 years old."
4,Good watch overall,"I've had this watch a few months now. It looks good. It's durable. I've bumped into a bunch of things with it, and the face has no scratches. It's very light. It's also versatile. I can wear it when dressed formally or to the gym.My only complaint is that the chronometer hands need to be zeroed often."
2,OK Watch,I purchased this watch with a black face. Visibility is a problem. The dials and hands tend to blend in with each other making telling time difficult. The watch is on the small side for a man's watch so the date and subdials are tiny. Setting the alarm requires unscrewing the stem.The alarm may be useful as a reminder but is too soft to wake up an average sleeper.
4,Pioneros: Puerto Ricans in New York City,It was incredibly interesting to relive my parents voyage from Puerto Rico to New York City!

5,C'mon Disney!!,"I just want to add my voice to the calls for The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh to be released! As a young girl I was absolutely mesmorized by it (and I seem to recall a slight crush on Sean Scully...) The atmosphere was like every adventure novel come to life!Please release this on dvd; I want to share it with my young nieces and nephews. Other dvds I would love to see from Disney are The Fighting Prince of Donegal, Mosby's Marauders and Almost Angels."
5,A Must-Have Walt Disney classic,"This was my favorite Disney movie when I was a child. The emphasis in the movie was that the people of Romney Marsh were good people, who smuggled products into England so that they would have enough income to survive. Misty moors at night, spooky costumes, fast horses, intrigue and daring escapes made it an annual Halloween favorite at our house. It was one of the longer length motion pictures that Disney had produced at the time, and would be well worth buying. Please re-release it in Blue Ray!"
4,Scarecrow,"I would design ""Scarecrow"" outfits and ride around the neighborhood in it yelling, ""Thief, liar, traitor, convicted of your own words!"" Oh, impressionable youth. Please Disney, release this fantastic series.""On the southern coast of England, there's a story we will tell, of days long ago when the great Scarecrow would ride through the jaws of Hell, and laugh...with a fiendish yell!"""
2,Gift for wife. Good story line.,"Great acting, good guys win, bad guys lose.Wife had looked for it for years and had pretty well forgotten about it.She was extremely pleased that I found it - anywhere.For the money, would have expected much better quality.Recommend to those who want to spend this much for less than averagequality -if - she just had to have it."
4,The Scarecrow rides,"A largely forgotten but excellent Disney adaptation of Russel Thorndike's historical stories of Dr Syn, by day a quiet and God-fearing local vicar; but by night the leader of a gang of smugglers known as Night Riders of Romney Marsh. Great family entertainment with Patrick McGoohan (Danger Man, The Prisoner)as Dr Syn: Alias the Scarecrow."
5,The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh Rocks!,"If I could own only one movie from my childhood, this would be it. I was in kindergarten when ""Scarecrow"" was released, and it changed my life. I developed a love for history and justice on the spot. Many years later, living in England, I made a pilgrimage to Romney Marsh; visiting Dimchurch and the Dr. Syn room in the Mermaid Inn in Rye. Patrick McGoohan is to the ""the Scarecrow"" what Johnny Depp is to ""Pirates of the Carribean."" In the days before amazing special effects, this movie satisfied youth of all ages with hidden rooms,secret identities, daring midnight raids, and loyal fair ladies. If Disney ever puts this movie on DVD, buy it!"
5,Dr. Syn & more are on the way!!!,"Yippee! Disney announced today the new line of Walt Disney Treasures. Destino, Chronological Donald volume 4 & last & certainly not least Dr. Syn. Two discs will contain it in the 3 episode Wonderful World of Disney & movie formats. A great announcement from Disney.Edit: Destino has been cancelled & will be replaced by a Treasure featuring Annette."
5,"Easy to understand, and fun. Excellent book!","Super fun! Easy to understand, and educational! My daughter loves it! She has learned so much from this book on her own, and has liked the review of those things she already knew. Very complete coverage of basics, not a lot of repetition though. Love it!"
3,Curriculum Evaluation,"I can't evaluate the success of the book because it I mailed it to a young student in need of further help. As an educator, I felt the book included a little of everything he needed to know. Hopefully, it will help him along."
2,"Very challenging, not something the kids can do themselves","I bought this for my step-daughter because she didn't do as well in school last year as she should have. Partially because of the school, but I thought that this would give her a head start. She was frustrated most of the time because she didn't know anything. There are parts where you have to use prior knowledge about things and write about it and she didn't have any prior knowledge. Another thing was that she had to write essays about things, I don't remember writing essays on things until I was in Junior High, so that was also frustrating. You pretty much had to have a dictionary and encyclopedia in front of you the entire time. The math section was good, it was pretty much self explanatory. Most of the time I had to play teacher because she just didn't understand and it confused me! I just wanted them to sit down with their books and do them, not to play school!"
3,Why Isn't This On DVD?,I Like Doris day movies and I think Tea for Two is a cute movie and I like the plot and the singing and dancing. I can't belive this movie hasn't been put on DVD. Last year several of Doris Day's movies were put out on region 1 DVd's but sadly Tea ForvTwo wan't one of them so please put this charming movie out on DVD!
4,A Must for Eve Arden Admirers,"Sure, Doris is great, Gordon is hunky and Cuddles is lovable, but view this film through the eyes of Eve Arden's character. She thinks it's all rather silly and it is -- but great fun.At the piano, Eve Arden practically looks into the camera and deadpans, ""Does this strike anyone else as completely imbecillic?""Yes, it is and the world will not forget!"
3,Why Isn't This On DVD?,I Like Doris day movies and I think Tea for Two is a cute movie and I like the plot and the singing and dancing. I can't belive this movie hasn't been put on DVD. Last year several of Doris Day's movies were put out on region 1 DVd's but sadly Tea For Two wan't one of them so please put this charming movie out on DVD!
3,DORIS DAY A HIT,"THIS MUSICAL IS BASED ON NO NO NANETTE AND IS ENTERTAINING, DORIS IS ALWAYS GOOD GORDON MACRAE SINGS A LITTLE AND LOOKS SO HANDSOME! THE STAR OF THE SHOW WAS GENE NELSON (ICE SKATER, SINGER, DANCER AND DIRECTOR) VERY TALENTED AND IT SHOWS IN THIS MOVIE.)"
3,Good action movie.,"I'm not sure if this is the American version or not, but I thought that the movie was pretty good. It had some pretty good stunts and some good fight scenes, including one with Bill ""the Superfoot"" Wallace. The story isn't that bad either. Basically Jackie is an immigrant NY cop who is sent to Hong Kong to rescue an American business women from a Hong Kong crime kingpin. Danny Aiello plays his partner in it. Overall I would recommend it to any Jackie Chan fan. I would have given it four stars, but I took one away because the Taiseng copy is awful. There is a high pitch squeal throughout the movie and the picture looks like a bootleg copy. Oh yeah, and you cant read the subtitles since it was originally formatted for the big screen."
2,THIS MOVIE'S NOT TRUE TO JACKIE CHAN'S LEGACY!,"TWO COPS [JACKIE CHAN AND DANNY AIELLO] TRY TO BUST UP A MAJOR DRUG OPERATION. THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT JACKIE CHAN TRYED TO BREAK INTO THE AMERICAN MARKET. AND LIKE THE FIRST TIME [HIS FIRST AMERICAN MOVIE WAS ''THE BIG BRAWL''], THIS FAILED AT BEING A HIT. BUT UNLIKE ''THE BIG BRAWL'', THIS MOVIE WAS PRETTY BORING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES. BUT, JACKIE DOES BEHAVE REALLY REALLY DIFFERENT IN THIS MOVIE, AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF HIS OTHER MOVIES. IN THIS MOVIE, JACKIE DROPS THE F BOMB [SEVERAL TIMES AT THAT], JACKIE TREATS WOMEN WITH LITTLE RESPECT, AND HE'S REALLY QUICK TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE. WHAT RUINS THIS MOVIE IS THE FACT THAT JACKIE TRYS TO BE TOO SERIOUS AND THE FACT THAT JACKIE NEVER REALLY GETS A FAIR CHANCE TO FULLY SHOW OFF HIS AMAZING MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS. FANS OF JACKIE CHAN MIGHT WATCH THIS OUTTA CURIOSITY. BUT, IF YOU DO WATCH THIS, WAIT FOR IT TO COME ON TV OR RENT IT. BUT DON'T BUY THIS."
4,Protector 4 stars,Exciting film from start to finish. Early Chan U.S. movie ( his first or second ).Remember when Statue of Liberty was being renavated ?
2,The Protector (1985),"This film is an ADULT FILM!! IT'S FILLED WITH BLOOD, GUTS FLYING, NUDITY AND JACKIE EVN SWEARS! A wealthy man's daughter is kidnapped and Jackie Chan and Danny Aiello are on the case!"
3,A rather okay movie...,"When I first saw the HK version about five years ago and I liked the storyline. This is not the usual Chan flick and so do not expect any Project A kind of stunts or humor.The storyline is quite good and the ending fight scene between Superfoot(Bill Wallace) and Jackie Chan is worth watching in my opinion. The drawbacks are that Karate expert Bill Wallace are made to look like a damb loser when he kept swinging the chainsaw at Chan and that dialogs can be quite cheesy at times.Fave scenes: Ending fight(cut off the chainsaw parts and cut off the David Ho(Kingkong bodyguard) and Chan fight scene), icefactory scene where Bill Wallace kicks Lee Hoi Shan about like a rugged doll and the massage parlour scene."
3,May be worth a look.,"I have to admit I haven't actually seen this movie, but I've read something about it, and I just wanted to say that I believe this subtitled version must be the Hong Kong version that Jackie Chan made after James Glickenhouse was off the project. He reshot the actions scenes at the end, and I've heard that Jackie's version is far superior to the original American version that Leonard Maltin reviewed."
3,Don't listen to Leonard Maltin,"This is the HK version of the Protector, and much better than the American one. It has lots of the Jackie Chan mayhem you love, and some amazing stunts. (I'm not so sure about the plot, but Jackie Chan and plot seem to be mutually exclusive). It's also a hoot to hear Danny Aiello speaking perfect Chinese, and to see Jackie's lips speaking English, while his voice speaks Cantonese. However, I don't think I would pay $35 for it."
4,Misunderstood,"I haven't read all the reviews for this film so I don't know if anyone else has mentioned this stuff, but...The producers, etc. didn't get what made Jackie successful in Hong Kong and rather than make a ""Jackie Chan"" film and inviting his input, they tried to make him 'fit' Hollywood and made a typical cop flick starring Chan. The film works for what it was, but falls short of what a true Jackie Chan film can be.The reviewer for Amazon apparently missed the point of the naked women processing the drugs stating their nakedness was ""inexplicable"". Although not stated in the movie (perhaps the reason why he didn't get it?) the women are nude to prevent them from stealing from the drug dealers by hiding some in their clothing (obviously they do have one or two places they could hide it, but we won't get into that).Obviously this isn't Jackie's finest hour, but taken for what it is, overall not a bad film. Danny Aiello is a riot."
2,A Chan movie controlled by others is not a jackie chan movie,"This 2 star, fair, movie is missing much of what makes a Jackie chan movie so much fun. The producers substitute Jackies wit and humor with Sex, Gore and Cursing the universal method of spicing up a poorly written script and mediocre direction. This is not a family friendly movie. Near the beginning of the movie Jackie uses the F@#% word and my wife and looked at each other.. we couldn't recall a Chan movie using that kind of language.I have read that Jackie himself was so disappointed with what Hollywood produced here, he went on the make the police Story trilogy, which culminates in SUPERCOP. The music is more like the 1970's era sounding like TJ Hooker and other cops TV shows. There are a lot of good Chan movie and I think you can skip this one."
1,BIG BIG PANTS!!!!!!!,"I honestley thought that this movie was appauling. Jackie had no control over the fight coreography and therefore the fights and stunts are slow, stiff and predictable. There is one fight that particularly stands out in this exuse for a film, but other than that this film is not worth half a cent."
2,"Jackie's second American movie, Strike Two!","This is not a Jackie Chan movie although he stars in it. It has nudity and a lot of cussing. It is also fake and you can see that the punches are fake. The plot is dumb, although the end sequence was pretty cool. Check out the Jackie Chan version of The Protector but not The USA version."
2,Its just not jackie!,"I found the protector to be probably the worst jackie chan movie ive ever seen!Its definatly not a movie for kids to watch due the non-stop blood and guts and nudity.Jackie chan actually swears in this flim numerus times.Overall its just not jackie chan action,sure theres about 5 minutes of one fourth the kind of stunts and martial arts you expect from a jackie chan flim.So,to sum it up,theres no martial arts action,1 stunt(not even a good one),and all around its a pretty stupid flim,definatly not a normal jackie chan flim,DONT BUY IT,ITS TOTALY NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME!"
2,As the X-Files turn ...,"This was the year the X-Files went soap opera. The melodrama only got worse in season 9, mind you, but it started here. With Mulder gone, all the now-pregnant Scully did was cry and mope. Plus, as talented as Robert Patrick was in his portrayal of Agent John Doggett, he and Scully did not have the rapport that she and Mulder had. The witty banter was gone. The dialogue that bounced between them only happened briefly, in the few episodes David Duchovny appeared in. And as wonderful as the final episode of the season was (that liplock between Mulder and Scully!) it was only the segue into the even more dismal season 9.Maybe Chris Carter should have taken a clue from Duchovny and bowed out after Season 7. Of course, even with a lot lacking in this season, it ended beautifully. Then Carter had to go screw it up with Season 9."
2,PUT IN THE CHECK BOXES SO IT CAN BE BOUGHT!,"I REALLY WANT TO BUY THE 8th SEASON OF THE X-FILES BUT EVER SINCE IT WAS UPLOADED, THERE ARE NO CHECK BOXES TO BUY EACH EPISODE. NO ONE HAS BOUGHT IT YET BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BUY IT, IT IS NOT WORKING. PLEASE AMAZON, FIX THIS! ADD THE CHECK BOXES SO EPISODES CAN BE PURCHASED (USING BOTH ie AND FIREFOX THERE ARE NO CHECK BOXES)."
1,"If you though this was the best, you were never a true fan","Ok, Can I give this negative stars? The problems of this season are far too many to name all of them, but let's hit on the big one, shall we? Casting. Could it get any worse then Patrck and Gish? Maybe it was the writers fault, did they really expect me to love the new Mulder/Scully wannabes? Dogget is a poor excuse for a skeptic, Scully may not have agreed with Mulder, but she was never as close minded as Dogget, and Reyes, the female Mulder, just comes off as naive. The relationship between the two is laughable, I could have cared less if they ended up together, or who killed Dogget's son, or really anything pertaining to uninspiring duo. They have none of the Mulder/Scully spark. The only reason to watch this season is for Gillian Anderson, who gets props for sticking with the show, and for the rare Mulder episode, which every once in awhile gives a glimps of why this show was so wonderful in season 1-7."
4,One of the best seasons,"I'd give it 5 stars if Mulder were in every episode. I know a lot of people hate this season for no other reason than that, but you have to look beyond it. The fact is, Mulder is in the majority of episodes in season 8. His absence allowed supporting characters to take on bigger roles, like Scully, Skinner, Krycek and The Lone Gunmen, to name a few. Also, in this season, the show becomes very action-oriented, something only touched upon in previous seasons. This is best seen in the two-part season finale, which are also some of the best episodes in the show's history, Essence and Existence. The writers take the mythology arcs in unbelievable new directions, and there is character development not seen in years. A must-have."
3,It's an okay season,I have to say I still have not seen all of the episodes in this season since the original air date. But from what I remember the mythology episodes are the only episodes that I had any interest in watching and they were okay but not nearly as great as the previous seasons.
1,What Happened?!?!?!?!,"I have been watching all seasons on DVD and enjoying them thoroughly. Season 8, however, is not very good in comparison to the prior seasons. Very disappointing.The only thing that was worse than Season 8, was season 9. Holy canollies! Rubish... seriously.If you are dying to see either Season 8 or 9, do youself a favor and just read a synopsis of what happened on-line. If you watch these two seasons, you will never get those hours of your life back...I would, however, recommend seasons 1-7. Those were very enjoyable and quite creative."
2,No Fox??,"This is a Terrible season of X-files because Molder is replaced by another actor... The new actor is decent, and the story line is pretty much the same, but it just isn't the same without the quick witted Fox Molder. I am now watching Califonication to get ""my fix"" of David Duchovny."
4,Underrated Season,"A lot of people seemed to be dissatisfied with the 8th season. As much as some people don't like to admit The X-Files is a character show and the loss of Mulder for half of the season was big. However I think that Doggett added a lot to the show in his absence. Doggett had a big disadvantage of being disliked before he even was introduced, so he had to earn a lot more, because he was seen as replacing Mulder. But the thing is that he didn't try to replace him he tried to fill in some gaps until Mulder would return. I don't think that the actual cases suffered at all and the episodes were still wonderful. I LOVE the X-files and I really like seasons 8 and 9 as well. The eventual edition of Reyes worked well with the dynamic of the show. There needed to be another strong female character and she fit the bill, plus she had a history with Doggett.The cases in season 8 are exciting, well writen, and fun to watch. I can't wait til it comes out, i'll have it pre-ordered ASAP."
1,The numbers speak volumes,"I hated season 8 and I liked 9 even less. Having said that I think the numbers tell the tale. The ratings were never lower than in season 9, even season 1 had higher ratings. People baled out, whether due to the story lines or to bringing on (gulp) Doggett it failed, and failed miserably. I can only speak for myself but I tuned in to see M&S solve cases and look for Mulder's sister, I didn't tune in to see what accent Doggett was going to have this week. How the mighty have fallen,(sigh)"
1,"Great Series, Good Season, But ""dvdmagnetinc"" is a Horrible Seller.","dvdmagnetinc is an independent seller you'll find under the ""used and new from these sellers"" button/link. stay away from them. they give you NO tracking information, they give you no delivery date, they don't even give you the shipper (USPS, UPS, FEDEX, DHL, etc). I ordered Season Eight and Season Nine, and have only received Season Eight (eleven days after I ordered), and have yet to receieve Season Nine. Apparently, even though it was a single order, they took it upon themselves to send them in seperate little boxes.I'd recommend newburycomics for a good deal and good fast service. I ordered the first seven seasons from those guys, including the movie. But I couldn't find them to complete my collection. Doh!"
1,Dead Dead Dead,Come on now... this is where the show was destined to be cancelled. Mulder was the reason this show had drive and purpose. He's gone. So is the show. Scully by herself is too annoying. Mulder is needed badly to make her character fly. Save your money.
4,Season 8 - A season to remember,"While not my favorite season I must admit that the introduction of John Doggett was a good one. I loved how the Scully/Doggett relationship developed.The eps rated with some interesting lines and concepts. From the Scully bounty hunter to the betrayal Scully felt when she thought Mulder had deceived her.On retrospect season 8 wasn't bad considering the Mulderless situation. Within, Without, Patience, Roadrunners, This is not happening, Dead Alive, Essence & Existence are among my favorites.My only complaint was the poor use of Mulder in the episodes he was in.All in all - not bad. Good or bad it's one of the essentials for any X-file fan."
4,New life in a favorite series,"I was wary of Robert Patrick joining the show, but from the first episode of the season, I was hooked. He brings in a new perspective that was sorely needed, and I was surprised at how well he fit into the show. This season also has some satisfying endings to long running story lines. This is a season definitely worth seeing, as are all the other seasons of this wonderful tv show! I do wish there would have been more extras though, also, considering how much it costs."
2,A cancer for a dying show.,"When i first viewed Season 8 back when i was in my teens i thought it held up well compared to the stunning first five seasons and parts of the sixth. However after viewing it again i have determined that it and its partner in crime Season 9 killed what was my favourite show of all time in a truly horrific and undignifed way. And i have pinpointed the exact point in this season where where the crime was done, and the show became but a shadow of its former self.And that moment is this.Agent Reyes standing over a murdered body and saying "" i feel evil here"".....huh...I guess all I can do now is cut off the X-Files series at a certain point. Season 1-5 plus the movie and parts of Seasons 6. Bring on the sequel movie!Heres hoping that i will not be sensing any evil from that."
5,Excellent season!,"I agree 100% with outerheaven23. Season 8 is a very misunderstood season, and resultantly the John Doggett and Monica Reyes characters have been misunderstood. I have to say I am a big X-files fan! Man I got T-shirts, and have tape recorded many episodes, including many from seasons 8 and 9. I love the 9th season, just as much as I love the 1st season and the entire show in general! The Lone Gunman, Alex Krychek, The Alien Bounty Hunter, Gibson Praise and many more characters return for the last two seasons. I do not understand why people are so dissatisfied with the last two seasons. Perhaps they too misunderstand them! Unfortunately since I have tape recorded many of the X-files episodes, I do not have a fancy episode guide list, so I cannot name my favorite episodes, of seasons 8 & 9. But believe me; most of them are quite good!John"
2,Downhill........,"Can anyone smell some shark jumpage? Robert Patrick isn't bad, in any other show he would be a likeable character, but I barely watched this season. Some episodes are decent enough from a writing point of view (and ""Via Negativa"" is the scariest ep I've ever seen). But nothing can get past the fact that it's all contrived and stretched waaaay beyond its limit. If they'd ended it on ""Requiem"" from season 7, with Mulder's and Scully's secret dreams come true, it would have gone down with dignity. Instead they had to drag it on when it had run out of juice. Once he left it became even more apparent that Mulder (together w/ Scully) is the heart of the show.And about the movie....I have my doubts...if it was just a standalone set somewhere between seasons 1-6 it might work.."
5,Season 8 was unfairly hated...,"I personally loved the later seasons of the X-Files, even more so than the early ones. I felt that in the early seasons, too much time was spent on Mulder's search for his sister. How many times did he think he found her or the answer to the truth only to have it not happen. I thought that some of the stand alone episodes in the later seasons (6,7,8,9) were better as well. I loved Patrick and Gish joining the cast and would have watched a season 10 of the X-Files with them and no Mulder and Scully."
2,Beginning of the end...,"It was inevitable that a show of this quality would begin to show its age after 7 seasons. However, the decision to proceed with Season 8 (with David Duchovny as a part-time player) was indeed a mistake. When you remove the central character from a series (while still referring to him: ie. ""What would Mulder do?"") you're in trouble. The show revolved around Mulder's quest. Without Mulder...you're left with people *talking* about Mulder.It wasn't Robert Patrick's fault (though his ""Mulduhh"" New York accent started to grate after a few episodes)...or the wonderful Gillian Anderson's. It's just a fact that when you remove 50% of a show's chemistry (chemistry that made this show a wordwide phenomenon) you simply have half of what made this show the best of the 90's. This season wasn't so good...but don't get me started on season 9. Oye.The 2 stars of this review are for the Mulder eps."
5,Just What I've Been Looking For,"I love these bras and I can't find them anywhere, at least not in my size! I ordered them in 3 colors and was extremely pleased with all of them. I love the bit of rubber backing they have on the band which keeps the bra from riding up. They also have a smooth fit and can be worn under sheer clothing."
1,Poorly edited version of a historic document,"Please beware before making your purchase that this version is poorly edited - numerous misspellings, badly formatted paragraphs and, most annoyingly, no diagrams or even the titular table of contents!Find another version if you wish to view this report."
1,total rubbish,"nice to read though: how to involve in things you dont understand and believe you're the one who will reveal the world... Enough , really. Westerners involved in tibetan buddhism, once they are caught by over self-esteem,cannot bear to witness how far behind they're left from real comprehension of eastern game-playing and get oover frustrated, so they go on in the same old fashion of depicting eastern ways as misterious, over-inflated with improbable subtle strategies etc.... the subject matter is obviously the same as ever: human misunderstanding and mistrust,backed by high intentions. It did not deserve so much gossip, it will not reward so much waste of time in reading."
1,Creating Schisms to What End?,"This book attempts to make the case that there is only room for one Karmapa, whereas there are many examples throughout Tibetan Buddhism of their being, simultaneously, more than one incarnation of a spiritual teacher. This book is a disgrace to the goodwill of the majority of Tibetan practitioners. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has said that both Karmapas are to be honored. Such righteous indignation and certainty! How smug!"
1,Strong bias weakens credibility of this book,"I was looking forward to hearing more about the current controversy regarding the two Karmapas in the Kagyu lineage. Unfortunately, the author of this book, rather than being objective, has a very strong bias towards one side, and his invectives again the other show he has no interest in any sort of 'even handedness'.After reading the shrill denouncements of anyone not in 100% agreement with the authors viewpoint, I felt all information in the book was suspect."
2,misleading picture,"We ordered the sofa slipcover and discovered that the picture online is not the correct image of what you actually get. The actual one looks like a striped army uniform. It is not light beige and green, but khaki, dark green, with brown and black stripes."
4,As Good As Classic Blues Vol 1 DVD,I disagree with some poor reviews for this product. I can not comment on the VHS version. However I own the Classic Blues Vol 1 DVD and didactically Vol 3 DVD is as good as Vol 1 DVD.Similarly to Vol 1 DVD the instructor shows the basic chord patterns and riffs of the song but performs it with several embellishments not mentioned in the video. These advanced techniques require a more detailed explanation to make it clear for the beginner guitarist. But you need to learn how to walk before you can run.The key for good playing is practice. So to be able to do that consistently you need to select the song(s) you really like. The Classic Blues Vol 3 DVD does it for me...
1,Toy of the Year??? You've got to be kidding!!!!,"This toy was voted as toy of the year, in ""Parents"" magazine. I can't believe it. The penquins don't even stand up on their own. And if you do happen to get them to stand up just looking at them the wrong way will make them fall down. I am so disappointed. This toy wasn't cheap either. I can't believe what a rip off it was."
4,Versatile set,"What a silly concept LOL. I got these on sale and I paid about half the recommended retail price so can't complain too much. At 16 months my daughter still doesn't get the whole idea of bowling but she likes the penguins, and the cute jingly ball has been very useful for learning basic catch and fetch games. I did try setting the game up to play for her to entertain her but she just picks the penguins up and runs off with them. She seems to especially like the purple one with the mirror in its tummy. Each penguin has different textures, colors and noises so they are quite appealing to younger children but I wouldn't expect much in the bowling department until the child is at least 2 or so.They can a bit hard to stand up but if you feel around the base of the penguin you can feel a rigid disc inside the toy which is supposed to lay flat in the bottom of the toy. They do get out of place but they are easy to manipulate back into position. That should help the not standing up problem."
4,not bad for the price i paid,"these were bought for my daughter when she was about 6 months old but my two year old son enjoyed them more for the purpose of bowling. he absolutely LOVES to bowl with them but i only gave them 4 stars b/c he has a hard time standing them up on his own. i even have a hard time standing them up sometimes. this toy would be a definite 5 if he could just get them to stand up on his own.my daughter has never cared about them as bowling pins but for general carry them around and chew on them purposes, they are great for her. and i have thrown them in my washer and dryer with no problems or deformities so they are very durable.for what i paid, which didn't seem like too much, they were a great value."
4,Great Game,"I hate to admit this, but I love the game. I started it (on a 3 day free trial) with my nephew, who also loves it, and I play it even when he is not around. It has helped him learn to read better, as all the ""tasks"" are written. It encourages team work as the cog buildings and factories are won easier when the toons work together. He is getting a computer for Xmas and he wants me to be his ""secret friend"". They cannot communicate directly with strangers as a changing code has to be given to someone. Most communication is through a speed chat that has specific phrases that they can use and the only one that I think is a little nasty is ""you stink""."
2,Was fine til annual fee,"The kidsloved the game on demo and bought their own for the home computer. We were a bit upset they each had to buy their own to have an account, but oh well. Then we find out that they could only play for two months. after that they are required to pay 10 bucks a month to be online. They don't even have the option of playing off line. Another example of Disney greed sucking the money out of hard working parents."
3,"Great fun, monthly fee too high!","My daughter took advantage of the free trial and loved the game, but I nixed a membership because of the $10 per month fee - this is way too high! I am not against paying $5 per month, as I do for my older son on another gamesite, but $10, no way. As I have seen in other reviews, it just seems typical of Disney to charge double what everyone else charges. I am sure they miss out on a lot of business because of this."
1,FREE to download- please do not waste your money by buying what can be downloaded: GREAT video game for 6 & 8 year old,"A wonderful wonderful game has got my 6 and 8 year old hooked. Great stategy, clean without the dark violence (more slapstick) then other video games. It is FREE to download this game, and thre is the free version- functional with certain things limited and then the subscription plan for the full access. My kids love this game and we use it as a reward. Try it free online, and maybe your kids will love the free version. But by no means spend one hundred dollars for this CD. The same version is free to download."
1,this game SUCKS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i used to play the free trials but after your third trial they dont let you have another one but they leave fetures out on the free trial so i bought this and i said ONLY 2 MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the this game sucks (unless your rich)
1,sucks,actually i think its really bogus that they make you pay for something and you think your gonna get the game without having to pay the monthly fees and you stilld do anyway.
2,You can find better FREE online games,"This game is crap. The main reason is because when you join, they FORCE you to rejoin! They will keep billing you! And there is no way to tell them to stop, unless you find their number when you get billed, and hope that they'll refund it. The game also isn't very good. I recomend 1 month of it, the game is pretty fun, but the fun wears off in about a month"
3,This game is OK,"This is OK. I think the adventure is fun, but not the fighting cogs and racing. When fighting cogs, you have to share turns, and in racing there is hardly any weapons or short-cuts. I don't hate it. It's just not as fun as I expected."
1,ridiculous,"Are you kidding me? I was just about to purchase this for my 6 year old son who LOVES playing it online with the free trials, (...). If I spend money on a computer game I am not going to continue spending money each month for it. It figures it would be Disney.....everything they do is a ripoff. I don't understand why they can't make a version that does not require an internet connection."
4,good tactical games,this is a goldmine of best short games which show how to take tactical advantage of opponent mistakes .annotation to games is not as detailed as i would like to be .nevertheless it is recommended
5,delightful reading,Nothing to dislike here. The games look so amazing that I have to go back and look at them a second time to see what went wrong. very little analysis is included or needed so it's very easy and pleasant reading. If you need a smile a few minutes with this book will do the trick.
2,JUST A BLACK SHIRT SOON.,"I like the shirt and it's design, but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes. I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print."
4,Great resource,This is a great book for begining legal researchers. It can even be used for people who are a little rusty at research. It helped a lot.
3,Pretty deep,This is a very well written informative book. However it reads like a college level psychology text book. Pretty bland and pretty intellectual. A bit over my highschool head.
2,Theory and a bit boring,A book on magickal alphabets should include a guide on how to use alphabets in a magickal working. Not this time.Essentially this is an amateur history book filled with commentary. In fact much of this book is simply materialsourced from other books. Don't expect to become a runemaster reading this one. It might fill in a few blanks fora researcher however. I was hoping something more practical and useful in magickal work.
2,Subpar For a Biography on the Queen of Talk,"This book by Helen S. Garson is quite subpar. Most of the ""facts"" that she gives are things that can be found (...)from watching cable shows that talk about Oprah. Oprah has set the new standard of what talk shows should be, but Ms. Garson did a poor job in showing this. She even describes Oprah as ""clowning"" for her viewers and audience when she gets excited about something on her show. Yes, I consider myself an ""Oprah supporter,"" and was very disappointed in this biography. The next time Ms. Garson wants to write a biography about a celebrity, she should get her research from more places than the local library."
4,Not Just the Usual Film Noir Suspects,"This isn't the perfect book on film noir, but it is very interesting because Christopher touches on films that don't get discussed in a lot of books on film noir.Chief among these are two Val Lewton horror films, Cat People and The Seventh Victim. It is nice to see someone discussing Lewton from a film noir perspective. Also, Christopher left me burning to see Breakdown, a 1965 film dealing with a scientist's mental crisis that he makes sound fascinating.He also does a good job talking about more famous noirs, particularly Criss Cross, which he examines from the Dan Dureyea character's perspective. That brings a fresh approach to his discussion of this classic film noir.This should not be anyone's first book on film noir, but it takes interesting positions and makes the reader look at things differently. Recommended for the person deeply into noir."
5,Seriously Funny!,On Moonlight bay had my roomates and myself laughing hysterically and quoting lines for days. Even guys like this show!
4,Another Doris Day & Gordon McRae muscial hit.,"Another Doris Day & Gordon McRae musical hit. Some of the most popular nostalgic music made into a movie. A sequel, By the Light of the Silvery Moon, is another trip down memory lane."
4,"Predictable Story, Yet Fine Music","ON MOONLIGHT BAY is one of those musicals that has a great score but runs out of plot in some parts. Story is creative, but the predictibility of the supposedly funny sequences are not up to par quite and nothing ""comedic"" that you haven't seen before. This only makes the viewer half-smile, not laugh. The lifestyle (even in 1916-1917!) of the families involved is not too believable. But with songs like ""On Moonlight Bay"" and ""Love Ya, Love Ya Honey"" and a great looking Doris Day, for the most part one doesn't really care. Grandly entertaining, only if a slightly concieted story doesn't bother you."
4,Doris plays a tomboy who turns into a lady.,"Doris Day plays a teenage girl to parents Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp. Doris is pretty much a tomboy. She can lift furniture and play baseball. The father decided to move into this new big house to live in a more refined neighborhood so his daughter could meet someone to marry. Well, while playing baseball and then trying to keep her brother (Billy Gray, ""Father Knows Best"" tv series 1954-60) out of trouble with the new neighbor kid, she meets Gordon MacRae in the worst way, and even gets a spanking from him. This leads to her first time in an evening dress and afirst date. A nice , cordial romance begins.Mary Wickes plays the house maid. Ellen Corby plays a school teacher.Funniest line in the film: Billy gray says, ""Everyone in town knows marjorie's old petticoat!""Sequel: BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON (1953)."
3,"Bright and fun, Doris","I gave it three stars because while I did enjoy it and I like the time period, I could have done with a bit less of the little brother, Billy Grey, even though he played it well. I liked the extras and I will buy the sequel By the Light of the Silvery Moon. I must admit, being from Indiana, that was a draw to the film since it's set in the Hoosier state."
1,On moonlight bay.,This video stopped right in the middle of the movie...had to fast nforward after yhat part to see the rest of the movie...not cool...
4,More romantic comedy than a Musical,"Its more a more a romantic comedy with great actors than a musical. Doris Day had made some better movies and had better songs in other movies. Whatever, the movie was a big hit and got a sequelBy the Light of the Silvery Moonwith the same cast (inlc. Mary Wickes where had her last big appearances inSister ActandSister Act / Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habitas Sister Mary Lazarus.Child actor Billy Gray (born 1937) made another memorable movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".And also Gordon MacRae (Oklahoma! (50th Anniversary Edition)can do singing much better than he do here in this movie.The DVD: the picture quality is really very good and the Technicolor looks fantastic.Bonus-Features contains a musical short and a carton which was presented together in 1951 with the movie.Fazit: nice made romantic comedy musical"
2,Low-budget fiasco of necessity,"This episode was the result of a very low budget and an uncertainty at the time about the future of the series. Almost half of the episode is scavenged from former episodes. The limited budget that the studio had imposed on the writers and the rather extravagent special effects used during the second series meant that the episode had to be made on a shoestring. This is a ploy used in many different TV series; Star Trek: TNG is certainly not unusual in this. However, for dedicated fans, such episodes end up in their ""most disappointing"" category. As far as the limitations of flashback episodes go, and considering the questionable quality of the first two seasons, this is not a bad result. However, being what it is, it is certainly one of the lower points of the series. I would, however, rank it somewhat better than such episodes as ""The Last Outpost"" and ""Justice."""
1,The Worst,"This is the only time that TNG had a clip show. After viewing this episode, you will know why it was the only one. It is obvious that the producers were trying to save money. And did they ever. This was the finale of TNG's second season. It was about Riker getting a disease from a Predatory vine. The only way to save Riker, is to inject him with androphins to try to give Riker, good bad, lustful and primitive memories. And, you guessed it, the memories shown are memories from the first two seasons episodes like Heart of Glory, The Last Outpost, and A Matter of Honor. The clips are put together pretty nicly, but I still give the episode one star, because it was rushed, it had a really, really, really bad script, and it was obvious that this show was poorly thought out."
5,The Alphabet Tree,"The Alphabet Tree is a wonderful spring board book to help emergent readers understand the importance of putting letters together to create words. I have used this book as an addition to other ABC books at the beginning of the school year for 1st grade children. They were excited and immediatly suggested ways that they could make words. Our classroom now has our own ""Alphabet Tree"" that the children put together. This is an excellent teaching tool."
3,A claustrophobic Easter-egg hunt.,"In Haunted House, you wander a mansion using matches to see around you and find pieces of an urn to escape. There are other objects to find as well, however you can only hold one at a time. Don't forget where you dropped important objects.Your character is represented by a pair of eyes. Using a match lights up a small area around you. This gives the game a very claustrophobic feeling, as you stumble around rooms with a narrow field of vision. Matches are also related to scoring, where using less matches to complete the game is better.Sound plays an important role in the game, and the key to using less matches. You can hear when monsters are close, when you run into walls, and whether you are going up or down stairs.Haunted House is moderately fun, however there isn't much variety between floors or mansions. Try the harder difficulties, which introduce locked doors, for a more interesting game.And I just have to say, that cover art is freaky!"
2,a little disappointed,The product works just fine but it did not come in a case. Just a disk in an envelope. Not what i was expecting - I'm glad it was cheap.
4,Great Movie,I really liked this movie. I think the actors did a good job. It wasn't as freaky as the first one though.
2,No point,I didn't think the first one was overly impressive but there was a reason behind the story. This one just seems to exist with no real point. Watching it I couldn't even disern what the point was. They just wanted to be creepy using a lot of imagery and scenery from the first but having no obvious connection. Acting stinks. Soon after finishing it I couldn't even remember the majority of what I watched because it's so banal and forgetable. Just skip it. I give it two stars because it's not even so horrendous you hate it. Just inane.
1,Can't watch due to digital formatting issues,"I bought this with high expectations since I caught the first part on TV and became intrigued. I checked the TV show listings for the future and it was not available again by my service provider, so to finish on TV was no longer an option. I bought the DVD hoping to finish the flick, but the DVD that I received does not play on any of my DVD players (3 of them) - the screen shows a""formatting error"" message, as if it is not compatible with DVD players here in the United States. Who knows, maybe it will play in another country with other formats, but it is useless to me. Beware of this issue if you are in U.S.A. and you choose to buy - hopefully you get one you can actually watch, since it seemed like pretty fun movie from the part that I watched on TV..."
3,NOT SO BAD A FILM!,"I SAW THE FIRST FILM WITH KRISTEN STEWART. IT WAS GOOD, BUT, I LIKED THIS PREQUEL BECAUSE IT TOOK THE STORY IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN THE FIRST ONE. NORMAN REEDUS'S SOMEWHAT SMOULDERING RANDINESS LOOKS & HIS FAMILIES ODDITIES OF NOT APPEARING TO BE YOU'RE TYPICAL AMERICAN TYPE FAMILY WAS TO ME MORE THE ACTUAL NORM OF TODAYS DISPLACED CLANS & MADE THE FILM MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE. THE STORY WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR INTEREST THRU THE FILM & THE LOCALS WERE QUITE DISTURBING. THE DIRECTOR USES A LOW LIGHTING EFFECT INSIDE THE HOUSE THAT GIVES THE FILM AN EERIE PRESENCE. I THOUGHT THE BRIEF SEX SCENE BETWEEN THE POSSESSED(NORMAN)HUSBAND & HIS WIFE AROUSING! THE FAMILY FINALLY JOINING TOGETHER & TAKING A STAND TO FIGHT THE SCARECROW WAS GOOD! THE ENDING WAS INCONCLUSIVE HOWEVER & DOES LEAVE THE AUDIENCE GUESSING."
3,Fun start but slow finish,"I was drawn to this book due to the type of sailboat - a Baba 30.I found the beginning of the book very interesting. The story flowed for about the first 3/4's, but the finish seemed a struggle for the writer. I got the sense that he was finished writing, but just didn't know how to end the book.I almost tossed the book in the trash when the bumper sticker line of ""...Air Force had a bake sale to buy bombs..."".As a sailor, I bought the book for the sailing stories. Wish there had been more.Not a bad book by any means, just realize it is a book written by a dentist of an amazing sailing adventure. It's full of hokey descriptions and weird phrasing, but it is interesting."
3,"Yes, but...","Okay, I've read the reviews and the book. I liked the story, but not the author. He spends too much time spewing cockpit philosophy, but what really irked me is his and Davey's easy ability to slide away from their responsibilities and in particular, their kids. They sail off into the sunset without a seeming care about how their kids might be affected. How many people dream the dream, but don't make the jump because they honor their commitments. aside from my personal disrespect for the author, I thought it was a good read."
2,Could not get over the arrogance,"In my opinion I felt the author was an opinionated, arrogant guy. It really distracted from the overall story for me. His writing formula is to explain a situation and then go into detail how he, being a dentist and all, was superior in his solution to the issue at hand. Major buzzkill for me."
5,Sailing the Dream (and the reality),"I agree with the other reviews. However, there is another important aspect to this book. It describes the work, risk and sacrifice involved in such a life-changing adventure. From the preparations in the San Juan Islands to the Pacific storms and the vast open ocean, the many experiences in French Polynesia, and finally to Hawaii, this is an inspiring and informative book."
4,1980's run from the rat race story,"A divorced dentist and his girlfriend leave life behind to sail off to paradise. The book chronicles in detail their journey, the people they meet, and their decidedly liberal/60's outlook.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story very much because, philosophy aside, John really takes you inside of what such a journey entails. I am curious what they have done with their lives post-book, which ends in the late 80's I believe.I actually was hoping for a deeper examination of life on a small boat, but found more of, we had such and such for dinner.A lot of platitudes. But I strongly recommend you read it yourself and come to your own conclusions."
5,Sailing the Dream,"Loved the book, very easy read. The way the book was written takes you on the boat with them, and you really feel the sensation of being there with them. Their descriptions of all the exotic locations made me feel I was right there with them. Made me begin to look at my current life in a different light."
5,Wondeful Novel,"I love this book so much. If you ever want to read about people you know, here it is."
2,A Reader's Dilemma,"My comments and review are here based solely on the translation work of Constance Garnett, not the actual text behind it.I found this translation so stilted as to be almost unreadable. This problem was greatest in the short utterances of some of the charcters. They would respond to what the main character of that portion was saying, but I generally had no sense of what those responses meant.My guess is that Ms. Garnett, in her attempt to stay faithful to the Russian, stayed away from using English idiom, but this sadly resulted in severe loss of clarity. I would recommend that potential readers look for a more modern translation."
1,Watch Out! Factory Mistake!,"Same thing happened to me when I purchased this CD set as the other reviewer! Got 2 cd's but they had the same songs on both! Both labeled 1 and 2. Big mistake at the factory. The people that got both cd's as advertised.....you are lucky!!!! Plus the song ""When I fall in Love"" is NOT Marilyn Monroe!!!"
3,Marilyn shines-as usual,"'Dyed Blondes' is a 37 track assortment of songs compiled by some of the most talented blondes from early 20th century hollywood. Best tracks include 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' and the infamous 'Happy Birthday Mr. President' by Marilyn Monroe, and 'Too Hot to Handle' by Jayne Mansfield. This is not an absolutely essential CD, but not a total waste of time for fans neither."
2,It's probably always been the same disk for both CDs,"I bought this CD ten years ago, a music freak friend of mine and I were patrolling the various shops in LA when I took a look at this one. He recommended it but warned, even then, that although the second disk was marked CD 2, it was identical to CD 1. Given the price I figured it was a fair enough deal for the first half of the set. And sure enough, my purchase verified his warning - both CDs are exactly the same content even though they're marked differently. Apart from that the sound is fine. It comes with an eight page booklet that repeats the track listing from the back but adds songwriting credits.Update: The currently available mp3 download ofBusts Up Las Vegasincludes all Jayne Mansfield songs listed here, including the five songs on this set's second nonexistent disk, plus an interview and a couple other tracks."
4,Gift,I purchased this as a gift. I was happy with my purchase as well as the delivery time. The receiver of the gift was happy with it also.
1,Broken,"Poorly shipped, expensive, I will never do that mistake again. I could have picked up 5 in the store for the same price. Ouch. Not worth it!"
3,"Roomy, but the neck and wrists are a little tight","I like it a lot, but I'm going to have to adjust the elastic at the wrists. For as big as it is, the nexk and shoulders could be slightly bigger. I can easily fix that myself."
2,"There is nothing ""streetwise""; just basic information","For a book on design and illustration, this book does not set a good example. The book design is bland and the information within is general. It seems that the author did not have enough information to write about and the book mainly consists of her personal history as a designer. This book is adequate for the novice who just wants the basics. But for those interested in a in-depth look at freelance illustration, well-designed with many highly-regarded illustrators portrayed inside, I suggest ""The Business of Illustration"" by Heller/Fernandes."
3,General help,"I found this book a little too general, not specific enough, to cover the different approaches possible for a freelance designer in NYC. Didn't cover the world of placement agencies, for example.Much of the info was for illustrators, it seemed."
3,"Stays on by friction, NO CLIP",No securing clip - I nearly pulled it out by accident a few times. Otherwise does what any SATA cable should.
3,LOCH MESS MONSTER,"Director Chuck Comisky might have been good with the visual effects mentioned in the Amazon review, but his talents as a director are minimal to say the least. BENEATH LOCH NESS is one of the slowest moving ""thrillers"" to come along in quite some time and there's just not enough dealings with the monster. Who cares that Brian Wimmer and Lysette Anthony were once married; they're both still pretty obnoxious and self-centered. And why the cliche of the crusty old seaman (this time the ubiquitous but not necessarily talented Patrick Bergin)? The subplots with the fishermen and the web site Nessies is also underdeveloped and nothing really happens on screen with them. Vernon Wells as the constable is so wooden, it's a wonder he didn't have wood lice. The Scottish scenery, however, is gorgeous and that's why a three and not any lower."
1,Fear the disturbingly holey plot....,"A crevisse has opened, releasing the Loch Ness Monster...But wait! She was up 17 years ago killing someone's child! Only one of the holes in this awful movie. Perhaps 2 suspenseful moments, spoiled by no good view of the monster. Add to this the cheese of the old 'divorced and still in love' trick, as well as some bad dialog, and we have...Beneath Loch Ness!!!"
2,Bad very oh so very killed Nessie bad,Okay first of all you only see glimpses of the monster and the graphics are so totally bad! I will say this the story line was good and interesting twist with Nessie turning up dead but lack of corpses and lack of monster rent it maybe but DON'T buy it!
2,Horrible Movie,"This movie is bad. It has bad acting and speacial effects that look like they're from a Nintendo game. The only person with a good scottish accent dies in the beginning of the movie. It also doesn't make sense. A security guard in the movie doesn't belive in Nessie even when he knows they have one in captivity! If you want a good Nessie flick, see Loch Ness (Ted Danson?)"
1,Stupid Overgrown Sardine!,"110% YUCK!!! The monster looks fake, the movie is pointless, and whoever wants to prove their inner-blondeness should buy it!I regret ever laying eyes on this movie... I love Sci-fi and fantasy but this was all-out dissapointing! A wASTE OF TIME!EW!"
2,JUST READ - I beg you.,"Please just take the time to read this.I love crappy movies. I really do. Bad graphics don't bother me. Hell, I'll give Bruce Campbell a good rating for his bad movies. I have many movies that are absolute trash but I love this. But this movie...wow. I bought a pack of 20 horror movies and this was on it. Sometimes I don't understand why some movies have bad ratings, but this one....WOW. 100% true.The beginning is interesting, hence the 2 stars. You really are like, ""Okay, I don't see why this is going to be a bad movie. The people are believable, there's a monster, the environment is believable. What can be so wrong?"" But by the end of the movie, especially the absolutely horrible ending, Just...For goodness sakes don't buy this movie. PLEASE. I love monster movies so this was the reason I bought the 20 horror dvds because I saw a movie about Loch Ness on it...booooooy was I wrong. Just...aweful."
5,Information and entertainment in this book,"This book offers its readers plenty of facts - and plenty of laughs! It's the witty story of an English couple's attempts to make a new life in Crete, the Greek island described by the author as Europe's last outpost of individualism. The author writes with a robust good humor about his experiences - and with an almost journalistic directness. ""Still Life in Crete"" will appeal mainly to travel book readers, particularly those who enjoy getting off the well-beaten track, but anyone thinking of moving to live in another country will also like it. Although it is a first-person account of actual events, the book's characters and the sustained and active narrative make it as readable as a novel."
5,Lost Chicano Oldies,"I recommend this to all Chicanos who like the Latin oldies. I heard just about every latin oldies music but these. Lost Chicano Oldies are lost Chicano oldies that have been diged up and surfacing once again. High Recommend, buy it now"
4,"lovely, longing","This spare book glitters -- with moisture, with crystallized salt from the body and the sea."
1,Not the best Henry Miller,"I found a copy of this book for about $2 at the Strand stand at Central Park. I ended up leaving it in a hotel room halfway across the world. I loved Tropic of Cancer and Quiet Days in Clichy. This book does not compare. It is a collection of essays mostly about literature and psychology. It is a terrible book. It was painful to read the sloppy, pontificating psychoanalysis and criticism. If you like this kind of thing, fine, but if you are simply a fan of Miller's novels, beware!!!"
2,Not as funny as I remembered,"Watching this was like nails on a chalkboard, creepy and annoying. I wonder what I was thinking when I faithfully watched this as a kid. Some of the other episodes may get a chuckle out of me but this volume just had me rolling my eyes."
3,i love animamiacs and enjoy this vol,Animaniacs rock but for some reason disks 3 and 4 dont run right.. and i cant watch the entire vol
4,Such potential to really shine,"This is one of the most outrageously funny cartoons of all time. The season 1 DVD finally is out after waiting much too long, and while I find myself laughing out loud, I must admit to being disappointed. WB did such a fantastic job releasing Looney Tunes with TONS of commentaries and special features. Animaniacs is devoid of any specials, commentaties, or background information. I'm glad to have the cartoons, but it could have been so much more. The sad thing is that WB clearly knows how to do this well as evidenced in Looney Tunes volumes 1 - 3."
5,Classic,Cartoons for both child and adult. It is definitely an art that either you like or you don't. For me...I like.
5,Spent 3 Hours watching the first 2 discs.,"Jeezo, what can I say? Animaniacs was a wacky cartoon, with all the classics in it: anvils, mallots, ""Bugs Bunny-ing"" enemies, and even the occasional fallen piano. It's kid friendly, but not completely kid based. Alot of the joke were of celebs, stupid commerials, and fraises a nine-year-old wouldn't normaly get. In my opinion the little shorts like Slappy Squirrel and Good Feathers (Good Fellas) aren't that great, in fact boring. I recommend this to any parent, grandparent, older sib, or old fan. Animaniacs could cancel every other cartoon in this day and age if it was aired again."
3,Animaniacs revisited,Many a Saturday morning used to be livened by Animaniacs. We have missed them as a family. It is great to be able to relive those olden days and laugh again; some jokes improved by the passing of time.
4,Good Episode,"I would rather download this to my computer then have to watch it on Amazon, but it's a good episode nonetheless."
5,Pure Classic,"I used to watch Animaniacs when I was younger. I'm now 22 and enjoy it all the more. In fact, I think I get a lot more out of it now than I did then.Also, I find it fascinating how much can be learned from this show. While I wouldn't recommend it as a solely educational tool, it is helpful for sneaking in some information to younger viewers (much in the same way National Treasure teaches history while being primarily entartaining). I especially enjoy Yakko's Countries of the World song.I bought this as a gift for a friend, and we watched it together, and I'm now inclined to add this set to my own collection as well."
5,An excellent product - must have for kids and adults.,"Animaniacs, Vol. 1 is a great collection of cartoons, great for nostalgic adults or kids of any age. Great use of parodies and site gags, and their irreverant humor and clever jokes makes this series fun for several reruns. These shows are just as great now as they were when I was a kid; you can't say that of many old cartoons."
4,"Animaniacs, Vol. 1","I love the animaniacs so of course I was very pleased that they are out on DVD. This set delivers what is promised, the first season. And while it is very nicely packaged I wish it had a few more extras included. The interview was great, but that's it for extra's."
5,100% Excellent,"Un reel plaisir de retrouver les animaniacs en dvd.Un des rares et seul dessin animé qui se fout de la morale et qui est complement loufoque......Guests stars, et autres bandes complement loufoques font parties integrantes de ce dessin animée hors norme.Rires garantisVivement la suite!"
4,"Interesting, but not for an introduction","Considering the writer's background, I was hoping that Allende's Chile would be sort of the end-all be-all for books on Pinochet, Chile and the coup. After finishing, I'd say that it's not even close. But the story is still worth looking at.What this book truly is, is just what it says: an inside view. There are significant passages on America's involvement, Pinochet and Chilean society at the time, but Boorstein really concentrates on political and economic conditions five to ten years prior to the coup as a subordinate of the Allende government.Some of the economic details get excruciatingly boring, but some of the historical background and personal experiences are what make Allende's Chile worthwhile.For a more detailed look at American involvement, I'd look to someone like Christopher Hitchens and his book on Henry Kissnger."
1,See text,"Before reading this book, understand author Boorstein's background by reading or listening to his adulatory (and somewhat confused) 1967 speech in ""A Tribute to Ernesto Che Guevara"" -- and understand Boorstein's own contributions to the Cuban economic system."
2,"Intersting parts, boring as a whole.","The author worked for the Allende government and the best part of the book is the 'inside' perspective he adds. The highlight is his narration of the efforts made by him and other advisers in the US to protect Chilean interests from American Multinationals lawsuits, embargos, etc..that could come as a result of Allende's aggresive programs against them .However, most of the book goes back to the same old boring common-place of how Imperialists Americans and Pinochet's ""Bad Boys"" are responsible for Allende's failure. Even the horrible economic situation is blamed on them. (Because Communism worked everywhere else!!!).Anyway, the book was written in 1975 and at that time that speech was believed. Today, we know almost half of the chileans support Pinochet until today, and that although Americans played a role, the economic chaos was Allende's fault... for his irresponsible and un-professional programs."
1,gazebo ho wood236 was not wood it was metal,was decieved on size i was told it was ho scale it was not it was more like n scale
2,OK,"Just not a great model. One I ordered an HO scale and got a N scale. Still will works but the pieces just didn't quite fit right and its not painted. All this being said not the sellers fault, but more on the manufacture. Of course shipping the right size would have been nice. Over all not bad but could be improved"
5,The basics I was never taught,"Simple things like how to use and clean a file are in this book. At some point, everyone probably just knew this, but with our specialized modern society, we are forgetting things like the best way to use an adjustable wrench (turn into the movable jaw). This is a very handy reference of tools and basic technique."
2,Not a compilation of originals. Merely a covers album.,"After reading the song authors' biographical information in the CD insert, I was disappointed to find that this CD is not a collection of old ragtime recordings but simply a collection of modernly recorded and produced ragtime covers. The production is too slick for me. Instead, I wish it had been a collection of crackly originals from some wax cylinders."
4,"Sci-Fi Fan, like RPG's with Psychic's? this is your game.",Trinity is set in the future after the the aberrants(super heroes gone haywire) came back. This RPG combines the white wolf system with a future setting with some of the most unique in rpg player accessable technology and psychic abilitys that make for a very intersting gaming session. I would reccomend this to any white-wolf fan looking for something other than grim dark supernatural of the world of darkness.
2,Not 100% Cotton,"The socks I received are not 100% cotton. I don't know yet if they sent me the wrong item or if they have incorrect info on their website. So, if you really want 100% cotton, I recommend checking with somebody before purchasing."
3,Not much bang for your buck,"Great vintage music if you're into these years. Classic recordings and clean sound quality.The only drawback - a big one - is that this CD is less than 29 minutes long. Ouch!A much better place to start is the Time-Life ""Your Hit Parade"" series from 1940-1949. Great 40's era music and the CDs are packed out with about 75+ minutes of music each."
2,Don't watch this before a test!,"As usual, Disney has just twisted the plot and characters to fit its own view of the world. The plot is lost in the cuteness that only Disney can create, and the characters become shallow and simple. I suggest the PBS version, or an older one. Even Oliver! is more true to Dickens than this. Shame on Disney!"
1,Elijah Wood's British Accent is Horrible.,I love Charles Dickens Oliver Twist story and I have seen some movies based on his book that were exceptionally good but this movie was horrific. Have you noticed that most of the positive 5 and 4 star reviews seem to be by girls who have major crushes on Elijah Wood. Sorry but I don't think they can be objective as they are extremely biased! I like Elijah Wood and I generally think he is a superb actor but I'm sorry but he was badly miscast as the Artful Dodger. His British accent was horrible and he looked too old for the part and in his costumes he looked like some kind of sissified dandy instead of a streetwise pickpocet. Sorry but this movie is a clunker!
1,The Little Blue Boy Plays The Artful Dodger,First off I want to say that I'm a Elijah Wood fan so I have nothing against this gifted actor but I was very disappointed in this version of Oliver Twist and I hate to have to say this but I think he was not right for the part of Artful Dodger. Not only was his British accent poor but the way he looked in the movie in his costumes made me think he was posing for a painting like The Little Blue Boy Painting.
2,"An unbelievable story, more like a fairy tale.","First of all, I don't understand this widow Corney having a locket belonging to Oliver (a locket than can lead him to his family), telling him about it and not doing anything to find them. In the book, there is also a locket which is an evidence of Oliver's identity, but Oliver doesn't know anything about it till the end of the story.So we have this Oliver travelling to London, but he looks a happy boy. The true Oliver is sad.But I find this Oliver able to move around almost free, while he is suposed to be a menace to Fagin's gang. and at the end he can make Fagin give him his locket, telling him he would peach. I think that even the most evil characters are comical.A film to spend your time, but as the topic says: ""The book is better""."
3,Mr. Wood Saved the Movie,"Let me start of by saying that my title line is not prompted by any fan girlieness!I borrowed this movie from a friend and found it much better then I had expected. Visually it was easy to look at, but not so much as to be unbeleivable. Dreyfuss was wonderful and very fun to watch. Elijah Wood lived up to what I've come to expect from his films. His portrayal of the Artful Dodger was both funny and heart breaking at same time. And his accent managed to stay in place rather well. My biggest qualm is the kid they got to play Oliver, he comes across as pretty shallow and unemotive or whiny at best. The character of Oliver was surprisingly badly written as he came across as a rather selfish little boy who cared for no one except himself and his mother's necklace. While Nancy and the Dodger both go unhappy fates ultimatly, for him.I'd reccomend it as a fun watch, so long as you can ignore the title character!"
4,A lot better than I thought.,"Knowing the story, and having seen it done many times and ways I was curious to see how this version went. It was quite OK. I liked it. I thought that as the Dodger Mr.Wood needed to work on it quite a bit more, but he wasn't convincing but not awful, either."
4,a romance for readers who don't like romances,"Kip is a teacher by day and folksinger by night who is asked to join the tour of diva Lacey Leigh Jackson. She falls in love with Jamie, the tour electrician, but Jamie is hung up on Lacey Leigh.This is an intriguing romance because Jamie and Kip are genuinely likeable people and the reader will root for them as they make their cross-country musical journey. But there's so much more to the story than that. There's Wes, the exasperated tour manager, Eric, the cool-headed boss, Buck and Drew, the band mates that inspire Kip's career, Emma, Jamie's lifelong friend, and Mary, Kip's giddy friend back home in Minneapolis. Each of these characters round out the story and give it dimension."
5,Thanks!!! Great item..,"Very useful book! Helps a lot in outlining the Criminal Law, which theory based can be confusing."
5,Black letter no filler,"This book was invaluable for my crim law test. Dressler's casebook is poorly organized; his understanding criminal law is good for learning justifications and reasons for the black letter but is not organized to be a test-reference book.This book is particularly well focused and well organized. It is perfectly designed for use on the test because you can find the black letter answer you are looking for very quickly. It also has an invaluable section on how best to organize a crim law essay answer, seperately identifying each of the necessary elements for each of the actors and making it so clear that the professor cannot miss any of the points you touch on.Note that you will need other resources for utilitarian / retributivist justifications, etc.If not for this book I would not have gotten an A in criminal law. That's about as good of an endorsement as I can give it.I"
3,"Helpful, but the other Dressler Hornbook is better and more concise","This book has been helpful to me as a One-L preparing for my Crim Law exam, but I found the small hornbook written by Joshua Dressler, ""Understanding Criminal Law"" ISBN:0-8205-7001-X to be more concise and direct. They both have hypotheticals explaining concepts, but I would buy the small one first. If you're still having trouble with a concept, then get this one. It may explain the concept in a slightly different way that will make it ""click"" for you."
4,nice product,No complaints with this product. This bottle has held up well and has not leaked. I would definitely recommend it.
5,Nice Hot Water Bottle,"This is the first hot water bottle I've owned. It seems to be well made, and it doesn't smell funny or like toxic chemicals (it actually has a light lemony scent to it). It stays warm for a long time, and it's great for treating cramps or just warming up on a cold day."
5,Keeps feet warm & doesn't leak,"Not fancy: just provides the temperature of the enclosed water and doesn't leak. I probably should have gotten the sleeve/cover that is available (right now, I'm wrapping the bottle with a towel.)"
2,Hard and Uncomfortable,Not what you might like to cuddle up to on a cold night! The plastic is hard and unforgiving and it seems that this tough coating doesn't allow enough heat to come through. Would not order again.
4,Depends on how you use it,"I wanted something to warm my bed before I sleep at nights and I purchased this. Straight off, I can compliment the awesome build quality and the robust cap. There are absolutely no leaks whatsoever. The outer is pretty sturdy and it doesn't scald you when you pour the water. However, that said, it takes quite a while for the radiant heat to warm its environment. I find the region immediately around the bottle to be pretty warm, but the not all the area under the mattress. I place the bottle about an hour before sleeping. But, once I am under the sheets, it feels nice to rest my foot on it and soak up the heat. Pouring hot water from the faucet does not work AT ALL! It feels lukewarm at best. I have to use almost-boiling water for good results. So, yeah, there is some running cost in using it - the cost of gas/electricity to heat your water."
2,Seam Leaked after 3 months,"I got this for my wife and after 3 months it developed a leak along the seam.I paid the high price thinking that it would last years, not just 3 months."
4,a bit thinner,"I purchased one prior, also made in Germany, however the walls on thisare thinner + it didn't have the new smell (which was rather funky on the previous one)At the price I would recommend....I bought 2, thinking it was like my previouspurchase. I have filled them with boiling water fr the kettle and so far, no problems."
2,keep warm only for an hour,"It works, but too short. Not for a long night, not few hours, but just about an hour. I'm very disappointed. I checked instruction multiple times to make sure I didn't do anything wrong to make it misfunction, but unfortunately, it just not work well as I expected."
2,Hard to use,"Unfortunately, although a good size and would have been ideal I had a problem with the stopper. Could not get it to screw into the bottle no matter what I tried. Certainly would not have worked when handling hot water and would have been afraid of leaks. The refund process though was extremely easy and professional. Would highly recommend the company just not this particular item."
5,Awesome water bottle.,"This is a very high quality bottle, easy to fill and does not leak.Nothing about this is low quality."
4,fashy hot water bottle,"I agree with everyone's positive comments about this hot water bottle, but the one negative thing about it is that it doesn't seem to be as hot as I'd like it compared to traditional bottles. Perhaps it's better insulated. I especially like that it doesn't smell and that the fill hole is a decent size. I would definitely buy another one."
1,Disapointed,"We have a flashy hot water bottle that is 30 years old and is still working fine.This new one is not only flimsey,the srew in top leaked. The one saving grace was the prompt refund from the seller Perfect Beauty."
1,Too rigid and does not feel hot,"We usually fill it with hottest tap water 125 degrees F, but it feels luke warm and it is rigid. It would be safe for children to use. But I like my old Chinese hot water bag made of rubber - soft and feels like a real hot water bag. The Chinese hot water bag is also available for sale online. The Chinese have used this bag for many many years."
2,Fine Print,"My fault, but I didn't realize how TINY these cookie cutters really are... the listing does say that they are 1""-2"".They will be nice for making tiny cookies!"
2,Super tiny cookie cutters,I had been trying to find some nice well built cookie cutters that I can use repeatedly through out multiple holiday seasons and ordered these because they fit what I was looking for. I was very unhappy to find when I got them in that they were super tiny. The only thing they were good for was making ornaments out of because they would not make a cookie worth decorating. I am now back to my search for cookie cutters.
3,"I, too, cannot read","Wow, these guys weren't kidding! SMALLLLLLLLLL. I had NO idea they even made em this small.My own fault, but who knows? We were going to make ornaments anyway, maybe it'll work out!"
3,True to size,"I also did not read that these are only 1 inch, they are the tiniest little cookie cutters! I ordered them to be my husband and I's first cookie cutters since he never had made Christmas sugar cookies and decorated them, but these had to be returned. Lesson learned: Read the fine print!"
2,Misleading,These cookie cutters were way smaller than I originally thought. They didn't indicate that they were mini cookie cutters in the description. I was very disappointed.
4,Good reading,"Feast of Roses is a good sequal to Sunderasan's first book The 20th Wife. While I did not think much of the former, in this second book Sundarasan writing displays maturity and meticulous historical research. She weaves the intricate historical events with harem intrigue in a very able manner and manages to portray the granduer of the Mughal court. One gets a feel for the characters especially Nur Jahan who was both admired and despised..Except for some parts that read too much like a history lesson, this is an interesing read."
2,Uncompelling writing that lacks insight,"I found the Feast of Roses very disappointing. I never got into any of the characters, and the writing was very stilted. Also, lavish descriptions of the palace etc, but one never really gets a full sense of the machinations of the court. I also never fully understood why Jahaniger and Mehrusinna loved each other so. It was just stated as a given. Overall, I learned a little bit more about India at that time, but that is about it."
4,"good but not as good as the ""Twentieth Wife""","The Sequel to the ""Twentieht Wife"" although very well writen is a bit dissapointing for it lacks the passion of the author's writing. It is a bit repetitive, for the author tends to dwell too long re-telling parts of the story that have already been covered in the first book. Having said that I still recomend it, Indu Sundaresaan is a gifted writer that manages to transport the reader back in time to the Mugal empire, providing interesting descriptions of the politics and life behind the curtains in the Zenana."
3,I'll give it 3 for the sake of the first one,"I'll keep this short and sweet.The first book, the twentieth wife, was fabulous. However, despite the same beautiful descriptive writing as the first, Feast of Roses disappoints largely because of character development. Mehrunnisa changes greatly, but there weren't too many new, dynamic characters introduced. Also, I thought it was REALLY boring when Sundaresan told parts of the book from the viewpoints of Europeans trying to get trade deals with India.Final Verdict:Not as good as the first, but if you leave some time between reading the two books, and maybe skip the parts with the European diplomats, you'll get through just fine."
3,Pleasent end,Pleasent and expected end of the story. But not as good or as interesting as the firt half of the story.
4,A wonderful piece of history,Excellent sequel to The Twentieth Wife. The lead character will inspire any woman in the 21st century.
5,Couldn't put it down!,The Feast of Roses is a very necessary continuation after Twentieth Wife. Completes the story. Well written. My book group will read it for our next discussion get together.
3,Good follow-up to The Twentieth Wife,"Good read, but not as enjoyable as her preceding novel, The Twentieth Wife. It was more of a story ""told"" than a story ""felt""."
1,Terrible,"Don't buy this book -- it's slapped-together junk.The math questions in the sample tests are riddled with errors. If you want to be tested on your knowledge of the fact that 2 times 1000 equals 2500, this is your book.After I got frustrated with the typos in the pencil and paper tests, I decided to move on to the electronic test. Unfortunately, the questions in the electronic test turn out to be the very same questions!I can't believe I paid good money for this book. If you have a parakeet I guess you could line its cage with the pages, but other than that I don't see a use for it."
1,"Don't waste time with this guide, there are many better.","To echo the sentiment of the reviews below, do not buy this guide. The typos are rampant and they don't stop with the printed book. The software is okay but has some weak spots and bugs. The reading comprehension practice, for example, is impossible to smoothly scroll through, allowing you to only read chunks at a time. Kaplan and Princeton offer much superior guides for a similar price."
1,Typos Galore!,"Think twice before you buy. I have never seen a reference book with so many typos! I do not score very well on standardized tests & therefore need all the help I can get, especially w/ strategies. Ex. if there're 10 math problems of any type, I'll only get 4 correct. I need some type of strategy to increase my score even if I don't know the answer. I'm a little older than most grad. students & haven't done this type of stuff in a long time. Unfortunately this book has so many wrong answers & typos that it hasn't helped me much. This book also needs to be organized better & cut out all the useless talk. It needs to focus on what's on the test & the specific strategy you can use if you can't figure the answer out. I believe I lost good money on this one! I'll read all reviews before I buy any reference book in the future from any company."
4,Great songs if you like the guy...,if you are a fan of La Boum and its songs you will love this CD of soft music/soft songs and the LaBoum classics
2,Larger than anticipated,"It is pretty, but rather large. I was going to wear it directly on a choker around my neck, however, I now have to wear it on a very long chain"
2,Shallow,I had a hard time reading this book. Not very well written. The first half is all about Wyatt Webb and has nothing to do with horses. The second half is about his program which sounds like a good one but fails to teach you much about horses. Not much depth.
1,Dind't do what it said on the tin,This book is more of an autobiography than anything else. Didn't do what it said on the tin for me.
1,Dissappointed,Thinly disguised self help book which seems to help the author more with his issues. Returning this book.
1,Thirty Years That Changed the World,"Michael Green is masterful at describing the lives, trials, triumphs and even the thought patterns of the early Christians. One would be tempted to believe the author was an eye-witness, so clearly and succinctly is the story told. Easy to read with wonderful insights into the era of the Acts of the Apostles."
2,Same Shoes Different Results,"I had bought these shoes before and I really liked them. These are super comfortable and look very professional. However, 2 months after I bought these shoes they started to make squeeking noise; which was very embarrasing at work."
2,Love the shoes - hate the squeak,I have been buying Deer Stags for several years for the following reasons:1. Comfortable2. Durable3. Classic styling appropriate for the office environment4. Reasonably priced - especially considering the engineered comfort features compared with 'traditional' brandsThese shoes tick every box...BUT - they have a very annoying high-pitched squeak coming from inside the shoe. It doesn't matter what surface you are on. I had just started wearing a hinged knee brace when I got these. I blamed the noise on the hinge until the day I wasn't wearing the brace.You definitely won't be sneaking up on anyone wearing these!
3,shoes...,"good looking shoe, over-sized construction. Perhaps the foreign manufacturer does not understand the American shoe fit equasion. Feels good on the foot but shoe is too big! Again, you do indeed get what you pay for. A cheap pair of shoes is just a cheap pair of shoes."
5,Nice looking and comfortable,Great shoes that look good and are comfortable which helps if you need to wear them all day. They last well.
5,Best mens work dress shoe,"MY husband has been wearing this shoe for years. we use to order from JCpenney but they stop carrying them so now we order from Amazon. Great delivery,and very timely. The shoe has a great soft sole for men that walk on cement all day and still looks very dressy like the Wing Tip should. I would recommend this shoe for any man that is on his feet all day."
1,Deer Stag Shoes,"I bought a pair of these shoes and after four months, I had to throw them away because the soles broke in half.This was a third pair, so I give up.No more Deer Stags. They make faulty shoes."
2,"Nice look, but soles fell off after 6 months","I've owned brown, raisin, and black versions of this shoe. They are incredibly comfortable, especially the wide sizes. My only complaint is that the last pair I bought had their soles (both shoes) come unglued with just a few months of wear. The rest of the shoe looks great, but I can't wear them because the front part of the sole is coming off."
4,"Sojourner Truth, A Black Hero","""Sojourner Truth"" provided many facts and interesting things that Sojourner Truth did, howver, it did not keep me interested for long, I felt that too many details were put in one place and I did not feel that I was in the book. Overall, it is good for class projects, but not that good for a free read.As I read, I learned many new things I did not know. Another good thing about this book is that it is short. There are about 90 pages in it and is clear and understandable. Even if you are in 2nd grade you could probably understand it."
2,An old favourite,"I am buying this CD as part of my campaign to finally update my old vinyl collection. I have had the record for eons and it has always been one of my favourites.If you like Zamfir's style of music, (and in my biased opinion you have to be odd not to), this is a must-have. The organ and pipe complement each other superbly and the collection has everything from foot tapping Banat tunes to plaintive shepherd's songs.When I listen to music I do it seriously and with concentration so it's interesting that this collection is virtually the only music I can stand as a background mood setter.PS: I just noticed that I have inadvertently given this two stars instead of five and I can't edit the rating. A bit tragic really. It's worth every star I can give it."
4,nifty mobile computer,"Are smart phones the harbinger of what future cellphones might be? Ishaq seems to think so. He devotes his book to the Treo family of smart phones, which is now just over 2 years old. Impressive functionality, that greatly exceeds most cellphones. He points out that the very first Treo 270 in May 2002 was one of the first to be able to surf any site on the web, not just those with pages specialised for phones. All later versions were able to also do this, of course. Whereas the typical cellphone of later 2004, as I write this, still lacks the ability. And from what I can gather, external to the book, don't expect it anytime soon in such phones.The basic tenet of the book is that the Treo is a mobile computer, that can be wirelessly plugged into the phone net. Some users will revel in all the nifty little options. But if you're the sort who thinks a conventional cellphone is just fine, you may want to check out the different viewpoint espoused by the book."
1,TREO Fan Book - Your Brain on Silicon,"The description of this book is both vague and misleading in that it only addresses the Treo 600 and products which have since been relaced on the market with the Treo 650 and Treo 700w.Moreover as an owner of a Treo 650, 99.9% of the content is both irrellevent and obsolete. Consequently, I am extremely dissspointed that Amazon was not clear in its description and offers/recommends this book and would like to return the book for a complete refund."
4,Hair-raising tale,"Canis is a story so believable, it raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Unlike many authors, when Dr. Armstrong says, ""Trust me. I have a good story to tell,"" he delivers. This story about a savage creature loose in Houston is realistic as well as thrilling with credible facts and a plausible plot. From the fierce opening scene of a mistreated boy, this author spins a tale so realistic that you will believe the characters could be your neighbors and the killer animal just outside your door. The facts came from Dr. Armstrong's service with Houston's Health Department. The plot was creativity at its best -- easy to follow, with a hard-to-track antagonist. Canis delivered a surprise ending that made me say, ""I should have guessed!"""
4,worhtwhile,"it's easy to see that dr gawande has matured since his book ""complications""- ""better"" is a smooth, engaging read, with a great conclusion, but it lacks the worderfully self- efacing nature of ""complications"". read ""complications"" (5 stars) first!"
4,All the secret things you never knew about doctors,"I was fascinated from the beginning with this book of essays about health and medicine.The first essay talked about the importance of doctors washing their hands. Gosh, we all know that, right? We know how absolutely essential it is. Well, get this: doctors don't do it. And when they do do it, they don't do it enough.Mind staggering.And the rest of the chapters were just as good."
4,Thought-provoking,"Once again, Gawande comes with an intense thought-provoking collection of essays. After reading ""Complications"", I wanted to read more, and was not disappointed, even though I thought the other book a little superior. His writing is no way dull for such serious and intricate topics, and he has the ability to draw in even the non-medico. I look forward to discovering his other books."
5,Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance by Atul Gawande,"I find the book highly informative and well written. Atul Gawande discusses a lot of interesting and conflicting issues in a doctor's life. I would highly recommend it, especially for college students intersted in studing biology, or psychiology."
4,I recommend all of Atul Gatwande's books,Reveals the surprising guesswork and humanity of the medical profession in an easy reading style that keeps your appetite whetted without the burden of incomprehensible jargon.
5,Better!!,Everyone should read and absorb this world-bettering book! Thank you to the author for his insight and work motivating others to see the better that can be and act on it to better anything.
4,Better ... than most doctor books,"Surgeon Atul Gawande offers a reflective se of essays on today's practice of medicine. Anyone who is or who will become a patient - that basically includes everyone - should consider this thoughtful book. Gawande wields reverently the sanctioned power to open up peoples' bodies. One undercurrent in his book is the role that insurance reimbursement has on patient care (negative).Another undercurrent is the discipline of improvement as applied to medical practice. Practicing medicine is part science, part art. As in any endeavor, some practitioners are better than others and that which gets measured gets improved. Thus, Gawande suggests that measuring systems for quality, however imperfect, be nonetheless devised and applied.For an engaging peek behind the white lab coat, read BETTER by Atul Gawande!"
2,Interesting,I think you really have to know you want to read this. I gave it to someone who might like it and never heard that it was read.
5,Gawande Strikes Again,"If you've never read Atul Gawande's novels before, don't start here. First read his Complications, then come back to this book. If you watch Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice, Boston Medical, ER, or any of those hospital drama shows, Gawande's insight on hospitals, medical care, and health bureaucracy is for you. Don't take my word for it; go read."
4,Different medicine perspective,"Admittedly, I had just finished ""Hot Lights, Cold Steel"" which has turned out to be one of my all time favorites, when I picked up this book. I had heard good things and I was not disappointed. That being said, I felt a few chapters fell a little short of their mark and a still others were hard to keep going. I found myself skipping to the end of a couple chapters. The good thing about this book however is that it's almost a series of completely unrelated short stories so if you don't like the one you are reading...move on to the next one.I very much enjoyed learning of the OB/Gyn profession. That chapter was fairly fascinating."
4,Great nonfiction essayist,"I first read this author and doctor's essays in The New Yorker and since have read a couple of his books.Quite simply he is a better writer than most people who list that as their first job.And his take on all aspects of medicine, medical ethics and science in general are brilliant.In short--a wonderful writer who also happens to be a doctor."
5,A timely book for improved performance in healthcare,"At a time when comments on U.S. health care are loaded with inflammatory speech and defensive posturing, Gawande offers us a refreshing, moderate, and reflective look at modern health care delivery. Using his journalistic/investigative approach to answering questions, Gawande puzzles through current issues in medicine. His candid presentation helps to strip away the reader's preconceptions.Gawande uses engaging clinical scenarios to describe medical improvement as a sometimes untidy plunge into the unknown. He discusses how progress can be made in improving physician performance and offers advice to those who want to make a positive difference in the world. With his introspective, poignant observations and engaging style, Gawande breathes new life into the conventional medical establishment and demonstrates a clear understanding of the human condition."
3,A good read,"I enjoyed reading this as an anecdotal account of a surgeon's experiences. I did not feel it contributed much for those of us who already work in the medical field other than confirming that the system is broken. It does hint at suggestion for fixing it, and the author takes some personal responsibility as a physician for contributing to the current ineffectiveness of the system that in itself was refreshing."
4,The cover does not do justice,"This book arrived to me in excellent condition. A book's a book, therefore I did not need anything special. I just needed it to get here on time and in tact, which it did.The content is supported by great amounts of tedious detail which adds to description of the topic for each chapter. Narrowing in on the issue, the author puts himself in a variety of circumstances that the public does not recognize when considering medicine/ Health Care. Not to mention, there is no better person to write about the experiences than this man who has seen so much. The book does not stop at the simple, obvious, up front ideas on medicine in the United States. Rather, it dives into world wide issues and minute detail that come to a solution.I thought I knew most of it, until I read this book."
1,Bail Out,The picture and audio quality are the worst I have ever seen on DVD except for another movie by this same company.Save your receipt; you'll want your money back.
3,Bail Out: A Mantastic Film,"If you love good film, you will not like this movie. If you love bad movies, then you have met your match. It took two viewings for me to figure out the plot, but it was worth it to see David Hasselhoff as a gun toting tough/tennis pro called White Bread. Based on the scale of how much I'd pay to see this flick, I'd say spend no more than $2.99. For more about this movie visit www.popcrazy.com"
3,Pretty Good,I liked this book. The heroine wasn't simpering and the hero was strong and dashing. But after awhile I got bored with the subplot (the mystery) and wished she'd just get on with the romance. I love historical romances set in England and this one certainly delivered that much for me.
3,Not up to her usual quality,"I was sorely disappointed with this work. It appears as if the author is recycling older works and just plugging in new locations and characters. Not enough time spent on the romance either!!! I also feel that the quality of her work has diminished since Ms. Quick began issuing her books in hardcover before the paperback is released. I normally grab her books off the shelf as soon as I find them, but after her last two releases, I may have to reconsider."
2,A sad fall from the glory of her previous novels,"Being an avid Amanda Quick fan, I pick up each book as soon as they are released, find a quiet moment when I can read the book, then proceed to devour it. This book, once completed, was a sore disappointment. Though I like a mystery mixed in with the romance, this book focused so much on mystery it left very little to romance and practically nothing to character development. You wonder who these two characters are, and how could they possibly fall in love when there are so few sparks flying. I feel this book also echoed too many of her previous books, almost completely lacking an original story. However, since I do love her books so much, I eagerly await her next novel, hoping it will return her to her earlier glory."
4,toothsome but enjoyable...,"I agree with another reviewer. Miss Quick's newer romances are a bit longer wordwise. But the longer length is not needed and I hope she goes back to her older writing style. That said-With This Ring's was still filled with Quick's signature humor, quirkiness, intelligent characters and sensuality. It was also refreshing to have a 40 yr old hero and 30 yr old heroine. This book seems written more of a adventure than and ""I adore you"" romance but is still quite enjoyable. The love scenes are well written, especially the first love scene-against the wall, woohoo-is smoking!All in all-even a mediocre Quick book is better than most other romances out there:)4 stars-recommended:)"
4,Amusing and Intresting,"This is the first regency novel I've encounted with the hero being --gasp!!-- nearly 40. I was glad that the heroine wasn't some little baby of 16 as I hate those kind of books. But this book, my second Amanda Quick, was good. The 'murder' plot wasn't really that intresting but the situations that Beatrice got herself into were funny. I borrowed the book from my library and I'm not so in love with it that I'll buy it but it does make a good read for a rainy afternoon."
3,Like book but soooo much like all her other books. Can become boring!,"I liked the first Amanda Quick books because, although the characters were almost identical (heroine-bossy,demanding, etc) and hero (hard, but understanding, some what aloof) all there characters have the same trait. This book was very good and I liked it,but I have to admit that at times it became boring because I knew what was going to happen before it did.The only thing she does (or whomever writes for her) is change the scenario or plot of the story line. I am on my 16th book and I can say that Amanda Quick, although a very good writer lacks imagination and I wonder writing under some many different names how it is even possible for her to have written all of these books herself.Still I will forge on to the last of the books because someone gave me the first 10 and I am determined to see if she changes her characters just a little to make it more interesting."
4,"Good, but was disappointed!","I am a huge fan of Ms Quick's, but was disappointed in this book. I felt it lack her normal flare. I had trouble picturing the Mad Monk in my mind as I read this book. The characters did not come alive for me. However, the book did have a good mystery plot, but was lacking in the romance department."
3,"More Regency mystery, typical Amanda Quick style","Not as ""silly"" as some of her more recent books, With This Ring does give the reader an interesting tale of mystery and intrigue, with her usual Regency-style humor. With I Thee Wed around the corner, I don't think Amanda is quite through with this particular story line. However, I think it's time Amanda quick get away from this treasure hunting/Zamarian/alchemy rut she's got into and try a different tack. But we still love you, Amanda!"
4,Better than average romance,"Amanada Quick has improved since her last book. With This Ring has a main character that for a romance is unusual. Good heavens, she is 30 and a widow. The mystery keeps you guessing and the side occupations of the heroine will make you smile. A Good Read for a spring or summer afternoon."
2,Not her best work...but okay.,"I've read many of Amanda Quick books and this one definitely wasn't her best. It was interesting at times even exciting. But it became too predictable towards, what should have been, the climax of the story. I read that someone felt the author was rushed for time...I tend to agree."
4,Irish wit runs Wild(e)!,"Yes, this is a tiny book, but it is worth owning. Wilde has issued forth enough wonderful quotes to fill a much larger tome, but, that said, this is a nice novelty item. The diminutive book is packed with great photos of Wilde, the quotes that made him famous, as well as many quirky illustrations of the author.Enjoy these quips from the man who uttered ""either this wallpaper goes or I do"" as his final words. I highly encourage you to also read Wilde's only novel, The Picture Of Dorian Gray."
1,Wilde certainly fulfilled his end of the deal.,"Mr. Oscar Wilde certainly fulfilled his end of the deal in uttering the wonderful words of wit contained in this small book.Upon finding this book on display in a major bookstore, time flew by while I read through the whole miniature thing.While walking up to the cashier to purchase it, however, I stopped dead in my tracks. Damn! The words on the back flap of the dust jacket read: ""Printed in China.""I'm sure that Mr. Wilde would have some sharp words to say about a book of his work - words celebrating love of life and liberty - being produced in a country ran by a dictator - one that routinely uses either slave labor (in the form of ""political"" prisoners) or indentured servants (as in people who are not allowed to either quit or leave a job once taken) in their state-run industries.I recommend Wilde's work wholeheartedly - but to purchase this tainted volume would certainly be unjust."
5,Great purchase,Got the movie in good time. The movie was in it's original plastic wraping and it was in great condition.
3,Read the book (in French if you can),"This movie is entertaining enough. Parents should use judgement, of course, because the themes may not be acceptable to all.On a different note, this film is an adaptation of a French film adaptation of an early 20th century novel by Louis Pergaud. Both film's turn Pergaud's serious (though oft times funny) social/political commentary into a childish romp. The book addresses some heavy themes that were major issues during the French Third Republic. It is well written and multi-layered. I highly recommend reading it. But be warned if you do, the films will seem silly and rather unrelated. ;)"
5,War of the buttons,"Great story telling. All coming of age situations handled in a way that was with humility, strength, honesty and supported with friendship. It defined values and resourcefulness all the while having fun and reaping the rewards of true friendship."
5,One of my all time favs.,I use to watch this movie when I was a little kid... & yrs later I still finding myself loving this movie as much as I didback then!! It's a fun movie!!
5,The Best!,"The first time that I saw War of the Buttons was in English class. My very good friend had just moved from Ireland to here, (pennsylvania) and my english teacher thought it would be a good idea to show the class the culture/area of Ireland.War of the Buttons is a story of two groups of boys who fight with each other for each others buttons and ties and clothes. This movie is rated P.g. for some language and violence( not bad violence, ""war"" violence, no blood) Any way, you have to either rent or buy this movie it is really funny, sad, and heart warming. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!"
4,"It is a wonderful story of childrens dreams and memories,","Well we watched this movie as an assignment in Ms. Kurz' english class at Everett High School in Everett Washington. We all watched the movie, laughed, thought it was funny, and had a good time watching it. If you are reading this Ms. Kurz I think I deserve an A. The movie was great and I thought it had a good moral and a nice thesis."
4,Great characters and story,"I loved this movie, my friends and I were horrified when boys our age were running around with...er...no clothes on. That didn't make the movie any less great, I reccomend it to all ages- there isn't any nudity I would consider vulger, it's quite safe, harmless far away shots I remember. the accents were good and I thought the characters were great!"
4,"Exciting,humorous,full of moral and pride!","This is a wonderful classic movie of little kids rivaling for the ""hell of it"". It's well done and the scenery is beautiful! The War of the Buttons is about kids fighting in rural Ireland. The captured boys get their buttons cut off and that symbolizing their pride for their village(and it makes their parents mad). When the leaders of the ""war"" get into serious trouble, they begin a lasting friendship not realizing it. Juliet4808@aol.com, my cousin,(who also reviewed this movie) recommened this movie to me. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!"
2,"love th picture, hated the format","The thing I didn't liked has to do with the format: it doesn't have a Menu to move the audio and language settings as you normally do in any DVD, and since the movie is in an irish english accent, it is very hard to follow the dialogues and understand what's going on."
3,A poor remake of what was a great movie in the French.,"The original was one of those movies you remember for years. It was with great anticipation that I saw it was on video, but this remake is watered down and lacks the character of the French version."
5,charming film...,Just wanted to say that this film is a very entertaining picture that anyone can enjoy. I too would like to know if anyone has any idea on when this film may be out on DVD?
4,good family movie,We watched this with 10 and 12 year old kids and we all enjoyed it. Very cute story and good acting.
5,A fun fairy tale full of furry tails to facinate!,"Wow, this second book in the Godmother trilogy by Ms.Scarborough is even better than the first! It lets us peer deeper into the domain of Godmotherdom and even introduces us to the Queen of them All. If you enjoy felines, the lovely lilt of Irish brogue and fairy tales, this book will surely satisfy you! The dialog flows wonderfully even interspecies."
2,Disappointing but the Author is Talented,"I was disappointed in this novel for several reasons. One is that it's more like science fiction or fantasy than a mystery. I found the transformations described somewhat awkward and the plot mundane. While this is certainly a talented writer, I was less fascinated by the cats in the story than I was simply creeped out by them. It reminded me somewhat of the Val Lewton film, ""Cat People,"" which still holds up as a ""cat horror"" story. At times I found it disturbing despite failed attempts at humor, desired to set the thing aside, and interact in a healthy way with my own feline friends. I will definitely not continue to follow the series. I have a house full of cats who I love and cherish. The cats in this book are something else altogether. I'm not sure what."
3,"Mystery, Fun, and Fascination","This is one of the more unusual mysteries I've read, but it's amusing and interesting as well as a good mystery. And it seems to haunt you afterwards. I read it on a lark, figured that was that when I finished it, but then I found myself eagerly seeking out the second book in the series. Joe, his girlfriend, and his humans are great."
3,Another cat book with a twist,"A fun read, but not exceptional. A good way to spend some fun time with a few unusual characters, but very predictable."
2,I quit reading,"I love cats, so the premise that a cat became human-like grabbed me. However, this cat story was not what I was expecting. Obviously, Joe's owner hasn't heard about neutering and neither, apparently, have the other pet owners in that town. Joe's antics as far as I read weren't cute or even very noble. If you want stories with animals that can understand humans, read Susan Wittig Albert's stories beginning with The Tale of Hilltop Farm based on Beatrix Potter's life. The animals in her story are funny, brave, and lovable."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It's definitely not what i was expecting. It has a cat who can speak English to humans, and a human who turns into a cat and back again. The mystery was ok though."
4,Good story,"I didn't know what to expect, but I'm a cat lover so I tried it. Good read and I will get others in the series."
3,Entertaining and amusing,"Following the antics of Joe Grey and Dulcie around the village after Joe witnessed the MURDER of Sam Beckwite, provides the reader with the opportunity of understanding the magic associated with the human traits some cats possess. A FUN READ!"
4,One far out cat.,This was a little unbelievable. Sometimes was not sure were I was in this book especially when changing from cat to person. Was not expecting this to happen so would like to read one more book since I understand what is going on now.
4,Cat on the Edge (Joe Grey),Cat on the Edge (Joe Grey)Recommended for cat lovers who believe cats have some extra sensory powers. It went a bit overboard though when the cat/lady became interchangeable.
2,Last Rose of Summer-Deanna Durbin,"You have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on thisitem.I am sorry I cannot go over 2 stars as unfortunately thereis a defect on last track of the record, precisely on the song""The last Rose of Summer"".Anyhow I intend to buy other DeannaDurbin's records as I enjoy very much her voice, but unfortunately the wallet is empty now.Thanks for all your help on trying to find ""Shane: a Tribute to Victor Young""but no euccess. I will try to buy another item later."
1,Vita: Confusion in writing,"If one enjoys disconnected dialogue, space and time jumping with widely dispersed segments of Vita's history, and lack of coherent threads to tie the ""story lines"" together: then this is for you. Otherwise, the writing is highly disjunctive and hard to follow, with characters and history sliding in and out in confusion (one needs a dance card to keep track of who's on stage and what era they represent). Perhaps if one read the book in the original Italian it would make better sense but I double it. At the end can any one answer the who, where, and what becomes of Vita? Give it a pass unless you like illustrations of less than meritorious writing ploys."
4,Beautiful story of life and love,"In Italian, Vita means Life. This is a wonderful story about the trials and triumphs of life. You will fall in love with Vita and Diamante and find yourself truly caring about what happens to this pair."
3,Vita,"Vita, the author's grandmother, arrives in New York alone, except for a young boy. The stories of surviving in the slums,with relatives, but no money, are well told. However, various flashbacks and forward make the continuity confusing as the author moves to future generations."
1,"Witty movie, Meant to put 5 stars, whoops!",This movie was great. It's nice to be able to have some comedy without anything crude in the content.
4,In for a different comedy?,"Ok so the writter/director/actor David Boyle was a friend of mine in high school and I got wind of this, one of his first feature movies. Having known him and his sense of humor I loved this movie. Not all might appreciate it but it is brilliant if you take the time to finish it through. I mean when did you ever hear a suburban white mormon speak great japanese through an entire movie? I laughed my a$$ off. You rock Dave."
2,Whew - Were They For Real,"This is perhaps one of the worst excuses for a scholarly text that I have ever encountered. The text fell significantly short of presenting disciplined research based conclusions regarding Domestic Violence. Rather, it presented a highly opinionated and politically correct rhetorical approach to the topic.The distinction between Pits Bulls and Cobras was intriguing but only after one was able to overcome these extremely insulting and derogatory classifications.Perhaps the worst part of this text was the meritless and unsubstantiated indictment of the Criminal Justice System. This system has literally bent over backwards to appropriately respond to situations of Domestic Violence. Often to the level where they are being accused as over reactionary.Lastly, this text further separates and alienates those who stand on either side of this issue. It paints a bleak and almost hopeless possibility of fashioning a socially responsible response to a grave sociological reality."
5,Great Book About Marriage,This book is a must if you want to build a mariage on God's principles. My wife and I have read the book together many times. It always encourages and inspires us to take our marriage to new and exciting levels.
4,Nice balls but did not work for what I needed,"I have several coin operated pool tables. One has a mechanism that ""weighs"" the balls to determine which is the cue ball. I have a special cue ball for the table, and just wanted this set for the object balls. These balls weigh as much as the special cue, so they were rejected into the cue ball return. This is not a defect or a problem, but I just wanted anyone who might be purchasing them to be aware."
3,great book,"My daughter is not an avid reader, but she started this book and could not put it down. Obviously the book teaches godly principles and keeps the reader totally engaged in the story. We are ordering all of Moore's books for our daughter to read---And they all get passed around to all teh junior high the girls at the international school here.I have read the book, but my wife has looked it over and confirms that there is a strong moral message as well as being well written."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"A few of my friends read this book and thought it was wonderful, so I had to read it. Once I started, I couldn't put it down! This book is exciting to read, and also has extremely important life lessons behind it. And because it is told from a teenage girl's point of view, I can relate to it even more. I would recommend this Laurel Shadrach series to any girl. A+! :)"
5,good quality,"The tape is exactly as it appears and seems to be doing a good job binding the books that I used it on. If I had to do it over, I would buy this specific tape again."
1,"Educational history, but not for the serious wood worker.",Maybe it's the engineer in me but I felt that the plans in this book were lacking. The furniture dimensions were difficult to find. The exploded diagram if dimensioned would have been of great help. The historical accounts were interesting reading but if your looking to build some Adirondack Chairs/Furniture this is not the book for you.
4,wood chairs,"This was given as a gift, to someone who makes Adirondack furniture. They told me it was helpful"
4,Pump Water for Free No Electricity Required.,"How many times have I heard people say ""my Grand Dad had a Ram Pump on his farm"". Yet the ram pump today has been almost totally lost in the modern fast paced world we live in. Which makes this book so important to have the ability to pump water uphill with no electricity required. Now thats saying something about the ram pump and the great book which covers from A-Z the plans for building your own pump. Get this book."
1,are they supposed to be zombies,"where to start describing this mess of a movie.first off the ""zombies"" are painted yellow,so they look like live action simpson characters.they move around like apes,they are scared of water????,and THEY RUN AWAY WHEN THEY ARE HIT.the ending had to be the most retarded scene of any movie ever,abunch of old bikers vs the whole city of simpson ape creatures."
2,Man.....terrible movie,"Dude, this movie was so bad. The only reason I got it was because it was pretty funny in a few areas. The acting and whole movie production was horrible. Do not rent if you are looking for a good movie! Never buy this movie!! Just rent it if you want to have a laugh at a crappy movie."
1,Dead Disc Failing,"The movie (what I saw of it) had okay acting and production value, but I never got to see the end. Two tries and two defective dvds. I have better things to do with my time."
1,Don't wast your time or money,"This will be the 3rd time I have tried to review this movie, the previous attempts I guess were sensored by amazon. That being said, if this review goes through I will simply say don't bother with this movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is a Cool Name, and Cool Coverart. Otherwise it is an empty shell, don't bother, there are so many other b quality zombie movies that are so much better."
2,There is something wrong with people who give this 5 stars.,"It's not good 4hero, let alone not good.4hero is, at its best, semi-interesting chill music. Unfortunately, like most artists, they display less and less creativity with each release. I actually pulled the CD out of the player to double-check when ""Superwoman"" came on. It's the Stevie Wonder song -- played straight -- and there's absolutely no reason for its existence.If you have every other 4hero record and you play them repeatedly, buy this. If you are so desperate for new music that the idea of a Stevie Wonder remake excites you, buy this. Otherwise, this is absolutely not worth your time."
5,Incest Isn't Sexy,"I think this is an amazing film, one of Malle's best, but I just wanted to respond quickly to all the ignorant comments that suggest this film is ""charming"" or that the incestuous sex was ""special to both"". If this is a comedy, it is a dark one, violations suffered by a young boy do not typically make me laugh. Even if he does not fully understand the ramifications of what is happening... how could he?!"
2,Another French coming of age story,"I love a lot of Malle's films but this isn't one of them. I guess if you find a really awkward, ugly, rude, kid who does everything he can to be obnoxious, charming, then you'll love this movie. We first meet Laurent begging money for the wounded soldiers in Indochina, but keeping the money for himself, then ripping off a record store, then trying to imitate his older brothers who are way ahead of him in crass behavior. Let's see what mischief they can conjure up--eating communion wafers is too below him, save that for his fellow altar boy, drinking, smoking, having sex, stealing from their parents, being rude to the servant, the father and everyone else....If all of this strikes you as terribly charming...then this is your film. Oh yeah, a pedophile priest is in it, too.Top it off with incest and there you have it. In the last scene everyone has a good laugh. Tres charmant, non? Non!"
5,Terrific Resource,My wife has led several bible studies using this resource. It does a terrific job of reinforcing our identity in Christ.
4,A must read for anyone trying to understand Hegelian Thoery,This is a widely underrated text due to Hegel's later recanting most of his points. But this is essential to anyone understanding the development of the Hegelian Model of thought
4,Informative and colourful,"First and foremost I must declare that I'm not an American but yet had the passion to learn about the Civil War. I acquired this book without thorough browsing and made a quick buy. It proved to be a good choice. All major battles and detailed mapping of events were recorded and with scholars like James McPherson doing the editing, you can bet that its historically accurate too. The main setback of this otherwise wonderfully put together book is the lack of coverage of less-known generals and senior officers."
3,Could have been better,"I stand to inherit the original, two-volume, slipcase edition of this historical overview, so I can console myself that there won't be a daunting search on Ebay or elsewhere for this must-have in years to come. As it is, the summary by Bruce Catton is concise and engaging - a perfect entré to his full-length books on the Civil War.My gripe with this revised edition is the overall quality of the press: the pages aren't as glossy and weighty as the original, and worse, the photos look poor by comparison. Trust me, the choice of paper matters! Otherwise, it's still a good recommendation for anyone looking for an absorbing yet accessible history of the traumatic period when America tested its democracy in blood and fire."
3,"Works, if...","Works, if you guess right on installing the hard drive in the case. Must set HD jumper to CS (cable select) or Win XP will not recognize there is a drive. Zero documentation about installing HD in case...the tiny two-page ""manual"" on the mini-CD assumes you already have HD installed! Make sure you stick the plastic side spacers in the HD mounting screw holes. Gave it three stars for working OK, but it was a puzzle to make it work."
4,Koi Pond,"The product was shipped as promised and the price for the light was a great deal. I actually wanted to purchase two lights, but the shipping charges were a bit ridiculous."
5,Close to Amazing,"Started taking after cold was becoming flu like. Took the Zong Gan Ling pills and within 12 hours the cold, achy, prickly feelings had vanished to be replaced with a youthful, warm, summertime sense of well being. Never had that one before. Really opened my eyes to the power of Chinese herbal medicine treatments. A slight congestion lingers, but this is the best remedy I've ever used."
5,anything can happen in anything goes,"Wow! This is by far the most crisp season when it comes to the animation. There are no imperfections or color disorders. I personally enjoied the second season box set much more then the first because it had a faster pace. Also, it had more stories with female ranma making it a good cross over. This is by far a must have for all avid ranma 1/2 fans. It is definatlly worth the [money]. I can't wait for season 3 to be realised!"
5,My 3 (almost 4) year old LOVES this book,"The younger girls love this book, but my Kindergarten age daughter loves it too! Very cute for Fathers to read to daughters, too! A must read for bedtime!"
4,Great replacement for original,"I bought this to replace a broken wand on my NorthStar sprayer from Northern Tool. It attached easily, and worked great. The spary head is a little different, but after figuring out the nuances of the settings, it performed admirably!"
2,Broke Before I Could Use It,"When I was putting this together, the nipple that fits into the hose from the sprayer broke off. It takes considerable force to push the hose onto the nipple and the nipple is not sturdy enough. I will have to buy off the shelf parts from the hardware store to repair it. I generally like SOLO products but this needs some work!"
3,JLab Audio,"The sound is good from the Miniblaster, but getting my Ipod in and out of it is a real chore!! It is very difficult to do. It not only is very hard to place in the miniblaster, but getting it out is even worse. I like the size of it as it doesn't take up a lot of room when I place it on the counter. Just difficult to use. It is also hard to adjust the volume with the ""skin"" on it."
5,"awesome prduct, good price, very convenient","for those who still have gen 1 nanos, this is the best accessory i have"
1,Horrendous,"Take a old transister radio, cover it with a plastic bag and hold it underwater while playing. That is about the sound you will get."
4,didn't come with DVD,"Our neighbor has this book and it came with a DVD by Santos, attached to the inside front cover . The copy I purchased was the same book, but did not include the DVD. It was not advertised as having one, but I ""assumed it would have it."
2,It was a descent translation but the details where skewed.,Carol Larrington's translation of the Elder Edda was good if you just want to read the storys but chances are if thats all you wanted from it you would buy something a little more modern. This copy translated all the names so that it was very hard to read and it also destroyed all the formatting I was sorly disapointed. for example instead of calling one of the charcters Gandalf like I would have liked it named him wind-elf.
4,english translations,"It is good to find an edition with Norse names translated into English. I have the Viking Society's bi-lingual edition of 1903 with the entire text in Old Norse, but with many obscure names left untranslated. For the information of the reviewer who thinks Gandalfr means Wind Elf, it doesn't; it means Wand Elf. Vindalfr means Wind Elf. What is more critical than whether names are translated or not is that they be kept in the order in which they are found in the original Norse text. All of the lists of names in the Eddas were deliberately arranged. For this reason modern translations that rearrange the names for stylistic reasons impoverish the original texts; I am referring mainly to Auden's translation which is nothing more than an elegant butchery!"
5,A glimpse at the world my parents grew up in...,"This is a great cultural history of a period I was pretty ignorant about. I mean I'd read a lot about the roaring '20s and the war years of the '40s, plus lived the rest of the succeeding decades, pretty much. It is written with a sense of humor and a real attention to detail. It's author was married to the author of the Auntie Mame books, and they obviously shared a wry wit and a sharp eye for detail, as well as a polished, fluid writing style. The afterword, which was written about the '60s and Bob Dylan shows an appreciation for the much-maligned youth culture of the time, and points up the similarities between the rebellious '60s and very political '30s, both coming after decades of political complacency."
4,Quality Net System,"Overall a good net system -- easy to set up, adjustable height levels, comes with carrying bag, gives decent play off of the net, sturdy when set up. Gave it 4/5 because the stakes on the border lines do not work real well in sand, but simply buying some longer stakes would easily fix it."
1,Not what I ordered...,I ordered the Park & Sun TS-CL Classic Volleyball Set and actually got something similar to the spetrum 2000. The net that is advertized is one of the best net sets on the market which is why I chose it. I wanted the advertized net because the guides to hold up the poles have handles instead of metal rings and are easier to manipulate. I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right. It was in fact the set with guides with metal rings. Deceptive. I could have bought this net at a lower price if it was indeed what I had wanted. Please be careful when choosing this one.
5,"Awesome net system, great price!","I actually bought 5 of these net systems to use for tournaments that I run. They are high quality and I see them used at many tournaments. I was worried that they wouldn't be the systems I was used to seeing, because the price was so low, but they actually were the top model for Park & Sun. I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Not OEM,"Nice quick delivery. Not as nice as the original facory visors. Very dark, almost opaque color."
5,The Brothers have worked it out.,"Here's the thing: Everything the ChemBros do is so chock full of confidence that they can't help but lead the pack. Their music cuts. It burns. There is nothing lukewarm about it. If ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" and the two B-sides were any more caustic, I would be a skeleton by now, considering how many times I have listened to this single. If any of you want to find me on June 22, I'll be at Borders (sorry Amazon, but you just can't ship it fast enough) at 9 a.m. buying ""Surrender""."
3,Chat Noir (Black Cat) Switch Plate,"The plate is smaller than the standard house switch plate. If you did not paint behind your original plate, then it looks awful on the wall due to a 1/2 inch border of no paint that surrounds the new switch plate."
4,good learning tool,"I find this to be a pretty good learning tool and of course it can also be used for review. Simple flash cards...they do a good job of testing your memory.Since they are flash cards they don't explain everything but there is a lot of good, if brief, information on some of the cards where necessary.One nice feature is that the cards are divided into three sections, beginning, intermediate and advanced and then color coded. That makes it easy to progress at a reasonable rate."
3,FAILED SEARCHES,"I accepted the offer to look inside the book. I did two searches of known American officers of the Revolution. One was Lt. Col. Josiah Harmar (who eventually became a general.) I got the result back as ""0 results for Harmar."" Sometimes names can be misspelled or have alternate spellings, so I also tried it as ""Harmer,"" but got the same zero result. I then tried a name which I was certain had to turn up: Hamilton. Despite his eminence, Alexander Hamilton did not turn up either. Possibly the online search is faulty, but these poor results give me little faith in the book. Both of these names do appear in a possibly superior book: Encyclopedia of Continental Army Units, by Fred Anderson Berg. ISBN: 0-8117-0544-7."
4,4Star cute movie,"I'm a big fan of 18 and 19th century movies and history.This movie is cute, and funny and all the actors played there characters well.I would recommend this to anyone who is found of a sappy, love drama.I would have to add that it needed a little more ending for me for the couple and what happened to her brother and ex boyfriend/neighbor."
3,Someone is getting too old for this genre.,"I love Meg Ryan I do. But this performance feel like a paint by numbers sort of thing on her part. Plus, it pains me to look at the plumped up lips and botox forehead. Why, Meg, why? Hugh Jackman, on the other hand, armed with youth and great looks is giving all he has in this performance. And it is he in the end that has you sighing and melting for gentlemen of yesteryear. The script does gloss over this ""portal in time"" and either you go a long for the ride or wonder how one even begins to experiment with leaping off a bridge. Overall, Cute but not a Ryan classic."
5,Clever and fun,"This is actually a second purchase... Our first DVD was getting stuck in the opening credits (after a zillion viewings...) Had to replace it... It's challenging when you don't have one of your favorite movies working at top speed... I know that Hugh steals the show, but Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber have choice parts, too... Oh, heck, it's all good :) I do have trouble watching ""the new"" Meg at times but... that's Hollywood :|"
5,Science and Romance,"Okay, I am not into romances, but my wife is. I put off seeing this because of the dopeyness that I expected. It was better than that, though. Enough science, intrigue and romance to be a good mix. Definitely a good date mix, but even good for a wider audience."
2,You won't have to work hard to understand it,"Okay, so it isn't James Joyce. It IS an easy to watch, fun fantasy, chick-flick, if you will... Hugh Jackman makes it worth your time just because he is delicious. Meg Ryan is just as we remember her from You've Got Mail, same facial expressions and general demeanor, which is not bad, just predictable. Basic plot can be reduced to everyone's fantasy of jumping in the old time machine to go back (or forward) to someone else's era for awhile to check it out. You won't be disgusted, repulsed, or frightened by this film, because it is clean, clean, clean. Anybody, down to your innocent seven-year-old sister, will go away with something to smile about. And in these times of terrorists and serial killers, don't we ALL need a bit of that?"
2,A So-So Movie with a Cute Guy,"I was really anxious to see this movie because it looked funny and romantic. Unfortunately, I was dismayed. Meg Ryan is playing the SAME ROLE AGAIN. She is incredibly great in ""When Harry Met Sally"", but in this role she is too old, too whiny, and too stupid for words. At times, I wanted to tell her to get a grip and grow up. Hugh Jackman was great and I loved the actor who played Kate's brother. He was actually funny. The character who was Kate's ex-boyfriend was just mean and not very humorous. Beyond that, there is not too much to say ..."
2,NOT EVEN A GOOD DATE FLICK- BORING,"Went with a few other late 20's early 30's couples and we all found it boring. Yes it is a cute romantic typical date flick. But it just goes on and on and despite a couple of good lines is generally a weak flick. I usually rate movies 4 ways. Worth $8.50, worth a matinee, good rental, and a waste of $4. This one is a good rental. Don't waste the big bucks at the theater."
2,Cute Romantic Comedy,"2 1/2 stars to this light-weight comedy/romance. It is harmless enough, and is cute, but there is little new material here. Meg Ryan ignores the man from the past and is too busy to see him for who he really is until her eyes are magically opened to his true nature as her dream guy. Cut plot, and a decent date movie, but it won't make anyone's top 10 list in any category."
4,A movie worth watching,"A very good romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold, brings to the screen the story of a 19th century down-on-his-luck English nobleman who travels to NY in search of an American bride who can help him pay his debts. Things get a bit complicated when on the night of his engagement he enters a portal and ends up in up modern NY...Hugh Jackman, Meg Ryan, Liev Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!Though not a masterpiece like Sleepless in Seattle or Notting Hill, or even French Kiss, Kate & Leopold is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"
4,Enjoyable,"Although this movie is sadly predictable, and the stars fail to shine, this movie still manages to be enjoyable. I really don't understand how or why, but it does. The time traveling part of the storyline is about the same caliber as that which is found in the Martin Lawrence film ""Black Knight.""I wasn't overly impressed with Meg Ryan's role. I feel her performance was more developed and appeared less scripted in films such as ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""You've got Mail."" Hugh Jackman did give a fairly decent performance, and definitely carried the film. However, I believe both stars fell victims to being confined to an underdeveloped script.Overall, this is a decent romantic comedy. I would recommend renting this movie, but definitely not buying it. You will want to watch this movie once or twice, but that will probably be about it."
3,Don't look for historical fact!,"As someone who knows a bit of history, the movie was spoiled a bit for me when the used a real character from history - HRH The Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, who had a real wife and real family. I would have prefered them to use a fictitious British prince instead of a real one. It would have saved me nitpicking this film."
3,Thank goodness for Hugh Jackman,"I hate chick flicks, normally. They are extremely predictable, sappy, boring and overly sweet. However, what makes this one different is, it uses time travel, and it has Hugh Jackman. I am going to completely ignore Meg Ryan because she is unimportant in this. Hugh Jackman is what makes this movie, and really, is the only reason to see it. He is so flawlessly elegant and suave in this. Its almost like he's not even acting. It's extremely charming. Like I said, the film deals with time travel, but it is in no way a sci-fi film. It is still a chick flick and yes, still predictable, BUT not as sappy or boring. It has its ups and downs."
4,Delightful...,"First off, I am a history and sci-fi freak, so this movie really hooked me when I first saw it on TV and I had to get a copy. The idea of using time travel to tell a story of romance is not new. But the idea to also show that men, no matter what age, could still be honest, charming and truthful to themselves and others was perfectly displayed by the character of Leopold played by Hugh Jackman. The only reason I took away a star was Meg Ryan. I am sorry but all her characters seem alike to me. I enjoyed the performances of both Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber who played important, if not major, characters in the movie and really added to the intelligence of the story.The extras, such as the commentary of Director James Mangold, the On The Set featurette, and the deleted scenes, are great and really allow you to see how the movie was thought out and crafted."
2,"Jackman is delightful, Ryan is not","This movie pairs Hugh Jackman at his most charming with Meg Ryan at (unfortunately) her most annoying -- he plays a delightful and charismatic nineteenth-century English nobleman while she plays a modern-day working woman who's meant to be spunky and independent but who comes across mainly as bad-tempered and frenetic. Plus, she has a truly awful haircut. They don't have very good on-screen chemistry, and the plot of the movie doesn't have much originality -- if you're a fan of time-travel romance, you've likely found this kind of story done much better elsewhere."
4,Star-crossed lovers with a glitch,"Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman play the starring roles in this time travel flick filled with romance, drama, and comedy. Breckin Meyer (Charles) plays Ryan's fun loving brother with a soft heart and quick wit. Meyer adds a jester like quality to the movie that will have the whole family laughing.Kate a modern day woman with a high-ranking job in advertising is about to meet a man from the 19th century. Leopold arrives via a time portal to nowadays New York City, and the fun that ensues as he learns the ways of the future are just the beginning.This is a fun movie for the whole family, one you can bring home to the kids and enjoy as a family. Kelsana 6/28/02"
5,a great movie,"I was a bit hesitant to watch 'Kate and Leopold' but once I started it was really enjoyable and I couldn't stop! My reluctance stemmed of course, from the plot ie time travel, which is certainly not new to movies.The movie is extremely refeshing (no bad language, nudity, sex) and Hugh Jackman is a very talented actor. It was clever of Mangold not to focus on the time travel aspect but on Kate's developing relationship with Leopold. My favourite part is definately when Leopold stands up as Kate is leaving the table, and she says almost angrily, 'what's with the standing??""This really shows us how much things have changed!!"
5,The best feel-good movie I've seen in a while.,Sure it's hokey and trite but who cares with a cast that includes Hugh Jackman and a delightful scumbag in Bradley Whitfield? The plot is implausible and Meg Ryan is getting to be typecast in these movies but she does it so well that it really doesn't matter. Anyone who has ever read a romance novel will love this. It's one of those romantic comedies that you will want to watch over and over. Definitely one to own.
4,Lighthearted romanticism,"Meg Ryan is as always brilliant in this movie. It is one of those lighthearted, romantic feel good type movies that you could enjoy on a lazy day. Don't expect much depth but enjoy it for it's entertainment value."
4,If Only All Men Were This Romantic,"Forget the Wolverine image of Hugh Jackman if you seen X-Men and lets start at the facts-this guy is drop-dead gorgeous when given a clean shave. I was really mushed after watching this movie and there is so few romantic-themed movies that I have seen that actually impressed me. At the moment this is the only romance movie in my collection. Meg Ryan pulls of the role of Leopold's romantic interest flawlessly (although she is really stubburn in the beginning) and eventually comes to believe the fact that Mr. Perfect is from the 19th century, although it takes her long enough and she nearly looses the eligible bachelor. If you like a funny, romantic and simple movie with all the mushy bonuses then this movie is drool-worthy."
4,not bad...,"I went into the movie knowing nothing about it. I didn't see any previews, I didn't hear or read any reviews. A friend that I went to the movies with wanted to see it, so I said 'what the heck'.It's a unique story line, not one of Ryan's best but very cute, charming, romantic and funny. Towards the end it was drawn out a bit but all & all not bad. And Hugh Jackman ain't bad either!! ;-) I just thought I would throw that in!!Do I say run out and see this movie right away? nah. Take your time, if you don't see it in the theater...catch it on rental when it comes out!!"
5,One of my favorite movies. Love it.,Leopold is just awesome. He is quite the gentleman. Too many good things in this movie to mention. You just need to watch it for yourself. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman were terrific selections for the stars of this film.
3,Tales...,"In a place everything is possible New York City is, a higher-caste engineer from the past found himself in modern NY thanks to technical endeavours of his future descendant, an ex-boyfriend and neighbour of a modern Manhattan advertising chief-executive.Sexy funny sci-fi film is rather of what modern males lost upon the time than of what modern females suppose parting with."
5,Lovely lovely fairytale!,"I'm into romantic comedies BIG TIME, and so far my favorite is Just like Heaven. This movie though, is a VERY close second!! It's dreamy! It's magical! And it's romantic! I'd say this movie is the closest to Cinderella any movie can get. There seemed not much wrong with the acting of Meg Ryan (I read reviews where people complained about it). She definitely looked good. She looked beautiful. And the romance portrayed between her and Jackman was better than I remember seeing in any romantic comedy recently. Veryyy highly recommended. One of the best love stories you'll ever come across.As I expect of any 'love story' with a happy ending, this one made me laugh, cry, dream...and completely convinced me all over again that true love really is true. :)"
4,"Charming, But Don't Analyze It","There are many errors with this film. The time travel concept is not very well explained. One reviewer pointed out the La Boheme error, there are several others (including the whole elevator bit). But why nit-pick this movie, which is touching and cute? It is a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy that touches the heart without going for the tears. I do agree with those about Meg Ryan being past the cute ingenue stage, but I am glad they didn't cast some young, sexy bombshell for what was supposed to be a woman who has already established herself in an executive role. Maybe Kate Hudson was busy."
3,"cute, but not a good Meg Ryan film...","I am a Meg Ryan fan, but this really isn't her best work. For about half the movie, she comes off as a really unlikeable character. Her character seems to be a bitter ex-girlfriend who can't leave her ex-boyfriend alone when she first meets Leopold. Throughout the movie, you do warm up to her, but you're not exactly cheering her on.What really saves this film is Hugh Jackman and the fabulous supporting cast. Jackman is magnetic as Leopold; you can't take your eyes off the guy. His character is everything a woman could want - charming, polite, smart, and sincere. Did I aslo mention gorgeous? He seizes conversations with a mere word, and finds the time to chase down purse snatchers.I'd recommend this as a good film for a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nowhere else to go, and you need a love story. It has its flaws, but it does keep your interest til the end."
1,YAWN!!,"What an amazingly boring, predictable movie. Having watched this movie, I no longer suffer from insomnia. The premise is great. A time travel story with a romantic twist but it is unbelievable in its love story and I figured out the end after ten minutes of sitting through the horrible pain of watching Meg Ryan play the SAME CHARACTER I have seen her play for the past 15 years and not be nearly as appealing as she can be. The performances are one demensional. The writing is bland. I found myself not caring what happened, I just wanted it to be over. Don't waste your time and especially your money. This movie is really one for your ""miss it"" list. Unless of course, your sleeping pills have not been working well."
4,Lighten up with Kate and Leo,"As long as you're not an uptight person as some other reviewers seem to be, you'll like this movie. We're not all professional film critics - although this movie did receive two thumbs up - so the rest of us who just watch a movie for entertainment purposes will enjoy Kate and Leopold. Not an oscar winner by any means, but still a cute romantic comedy worth seeing. It is entertaining and I believe that is the purpose of watching a movie - to be entertained by it, not pick it to pieces and over analyze it. Lighten up with Kate and Leopold and just enjoy the film! I would buy this movie."
2,Disappointing,"Have always been a Meg Ryan fan, but gave up on this one.The film has a great beginning, but after a while, the feeling is that it is too light and cute -- I lost interest in the characters, and didn't even bother to see the film to the end. (And this, from a Meg Ryan fan!)"
2,Do Youself a Favor ......,"If you get the opportunity to view this film, do yourself a favor and jump off a cliff instead .... you'll get more out of it. How an up and coming actor like Hugh Jackman could associate himself with this garbage is beyond me, but I'm betting his manager got fired.Meg Ryan in yet another attempt to rekindle the magic from her previous film You've Got Mail in Seattle while You were Sleepless. Yes I know those were two films, but I prefer to call them one becuase they were the same bunch of ...Garbage, garbage, garbage."
4,Kate & Leopold,"What a charming pair Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman make! This romantic comedy is about the Duke of Albany, and while hosting a party in 1876 he notices someone that doesn't belong at his party. When he follows him, he literally like ""Alice"" falls into the rabbit hole and travels through time to the year 2001. Stuart Besser found this hole thru time making time travel possible, and he takes it upon himself to introduce the Duke to the future while trying to find a way to get him back where he belongs. When Leopold meets former Besser girlfriend Kate, they can't help but fall in love.Yes, this is a completely predictable movie, but so what! It is the ultimate in romance, and we all need to dream a little bit."
1,They didn't match,"Hollywood ending doesn't seem to fit this story.Kate divoted for winning in a competition of ads for something like substitute for butter which tastes like soap.Leopold helped her succeed this project, alghough this is against the way he's believing.He shoulnd have aginst this with his belief and shouldn't have reconciled Kate.She doesn't change, she's been still selfish.She eventually picked Leo and gave up getting promotion and her current worldIf she would have done this, She haven't needed to pull off and the assignment of the soap butter's ads should be failed.In Leo's world, Kate must keep being selfish, I guess.It could encourage Leo's man who is an aged inventor invent equipments she knows and used to use.Leo was so gourgeous, Kate's brother was nice and cute.JJ seems pitty but soon he finds an another one."
4,A very enjoyable film,"All in all, a very enjoyable film. Hugh Jackman gets high marks as the leading man. The best scene is the one where he is doing a commercial for some type of butter...""Tastes like saddle soap!"""
4,A Major New Star -- Hugh Jackman,"until I saw Jackman as LEOPOLD and the wheels started to turn. I haven't been this excited about a new star since Sean Connery. (Yes, I'm that old.)...Regarding KATE & LEOPOLD (and I speak as one who has loved Meg Ryan movies in the past, especially FRENCH KISS, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, and CITY OF ANGELS, which has a similar fantasy element about love overcoming obstacles and about making leaps of faith)I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But she seems so sad (which fits her character)...KATE & LEOPOLD often reminds me of EVER AFTER --only it's a Duke instead of a Prince being forced into a loveless marriage, looking for a woman of intelligence and independence. The Prince finds her among the common people. The Duke finds Kate in the future.Like the characters Kate and Leopold, we are asked by this movie to suspend disbelief and to make a leap of faith. I find that I can. The haunting STING song UNTIL is a great bonus."
5,my favorite,"This is my favorite romantic movie of all times. Actually it is from this movie I found out who Hugh Jackman is. Never heard of him before. (I know, shame on me). I know it is a modern movie in a modern setting but there is something about it that makes me miss the olden times and the way how men used to be, so respectful, gentle and considerate. After watching this move, modern guys just don't appeal in the same way. Eeeh, I fell in love with Leopold. It's very light hearted movie that I can watch over and over and over."
5,One of the best romantic movies ever.,"This movie is on a par with You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and While You Were Sleeping. Hugh Jackman is totally excellent as the time-traveler - also he's the perfect man in this movie which should appeal to most women! It's great."
3,Three cheers for Meg Ryan...,"Thank god for Meg Ryan. She's possibly the only star able to take a thankless script like this one and make it somewhat palatable. Well, Hugh Jackman's burly charms work too, but really, isn't Meg Ryan the queen of nonsensical romantic comedies? Flirting (but not so deeply) with the idea of time travel, much about `Kate and Leopold' makes very little sense (and it all just falls to pieces in the end) but getting there is half the fun, and Ryan and Jackman make sure that a good time is had watching these two stars shine for one another. Basically it's your typical boy meets girl story, except this boy comes straight out of the 1800's and this girl is your modern day independent woman, searching for love and dating the great-great grandson of her new love interest (yeah, like I said...that ending). Shuck aside common sense and delve into Meg Ryan's undeniable charm and you'll see why `Kate and Leopold' is a crowd pleaser despite being so, well, stupid."
5,Love it- why can't all guys be like this?,"I loved this movie. Leopold is so charming- and you wonder: why can't all guys be like this? During the movie, Leopold makes you feel accepted as a woman. He goes beyond and totally comforts you. WIth a wonderful ending, Kate & Leopold, warms the heart, and makes women feel taken care of. It makes women feel just wonderful."
4,Kate & Leopold....just a nice movie,"My husband and I saw Kate & Leopold on New Year's Day. We both liked the movie very much...it was like taking a step back into a time when people were more genteel...more caring, etc.Hugh Jackman's role fit him like a ""glove""..he was perfect for it! And, Meg Ryan's role as the ""non-believer"" suited her, in my opinion, as she generally looks like she doesn't quite ""get it""..or ""believe it."" (I only wish..and once again, this is in my very humble opinion...that Ms. Ryan, along with many other ""stars""... would realize how AWFUL they look with haircuts that resemble a child playing with scissors!!!!!!)However, all in all, if one is looking for a movie that you don't have to ""think"" too much, you can just enjoy it for what it is...a nice movie...then I would recommend this movie...and have...to anyone."
4,Cute Movie,"This movie was very cute. Meg Ryan wonderfully plays the role of Kate, a woman who only has her job to keep her satisfied with life, and Hugh Jackman plays Leopold, a handsome duke from the 19th century who is transported to 2001 by Kate's ex, who lives in the apartment right above Kate's. This movie is heartwarming and funny, but if you focus on the scientific structure of a so-called ""fabric in time,"" not everything computes with everything else. Undoubtedly a chick flick."
2,Leopold's La Boheme,How did Leopold come to know so much about Puccini's La Boheme which was finished in 1896 and premiered in 1900 when he time-traveled straight from 1876 to the present? This nagging question ruined my enjoyment of the chick flick.
3,You see it ?,"First of all, I enjoyed this movie, although it's not the genreI favor, but the teaser just blew me away, Ryan doing what she'sgood at against Hugh Jackman's aristocratic gentleman, now he is good in any genre is'n't he ?Funniest part is, Liev went back in time, backto the future again, now with his great great grandfather who falls in love with Liev's ex-girlfriend and she for him, greatgreat grandfather goes back, in time, Liev's ex-girlfriend goesafter him and becomes Liev's great great grandmother."
2,Ok and Slow,I thought this movie had no plot whatsoever and it just dragged on and on. Slow and boring... you keep waiting for something to happen!! Too much bad language and NOT sutible for the whole family. I was so bored with this one!
3,Rent dont buy,"Meg Ryan is one of the problems with this movie. The other actors are much better. Meg is rude, her hair is an absolute mess, and as others have stated why would anyone want to fall in love with someone so prickly. I found the other characters such to be more interesting. Kate is not a likeable character. Leo is sweet, funny, has great manners and is so likeable that it makes the film itself seem out of balance."
1,ERRRRRRRR,This movie has no point whatsoever! This is THE worst movie ever. Once again Meg Ryan is in a horrible movie (Proof Of Life was also horrid) or maybe it's her.....1 star
4,Entertaining,"This is fun little time-travel romance. Meg is great as always and the guy who plays the guy is good, but Hugh Grant would have been better. But it's worth the time. Oh my god, I can't believe I wrote that. Hugh Jackman is fantastic.Having since [this is like a year later I am editing this] seen him play Curley in Oklahoma, I am a die hard fan of Hugh Jackman. I guess this little story didn't do him justice. He is the greatest talent on the silver screen or on Broadway. Hugh Grant should be permitted to shine his shoes."
2,Kate Ruined This For Me,"Leopold is a man from the past who follows someone into a time warp and pops out in current day New York. He meets Kate, a modern day career woman, and the two fall in love. Will she follow him back to his own time? Hmm, bet you can't guess.The storyline was simple and really could have worked if Kate had been more likeable. Hugh Jackman played Leopold well, really making his character come alive, but I just didn't understand why he would fall for such a plain-looking, gruff woman. There wasn't any chemistry between the two and I couldn't pinpoint the moment when the two fell in love (especially on Leopold's side). There were some good secondary characters, but the primary relationship (or lack thereof) made this movie a dud."
3,Something's missing.,"Kate & Leopold starring Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman is a cute romantic comedy which features time travel but I felt disappointed and I don't know why. Ryan and Jackman are very talented actors and they have great chemistry in this film but the story feels strange and forced. It's too bad that I didn't like this movie more because this film was directed by James Mangold, he is my favorite director but I just couldn't get into it. Defintely one to rent but not to purchase."
2,I would have to say 2.50,"This was an OK movie. It was not bad by any means, but the film seemed to drag quite a bit and I thought that it could have ended sooner than it did. The storyline was cute, and the actors did a nice job with the film, but overall I guess that I just was not that impressed with the film...sorry!"
3,"I don't believe in guilty pleasures, but if I did......","This would be at the top of the list. I have a feeling that the ""hook"" of the movie was that it's another Meg Ryan rom-com, but aside from that, it is actually a pleasant movie. Sure, the plot has some holes--if you looked up ""suspension of disbelief,"" this movie would be listed--but has some truly romantic and humorous parts. Ryan repeats her usual act; Jackman is great (and the REAL reason that women watch this movie), and so is the rest of the supporting cast.What's interesting, though, is how thoughtfully the movie was directed. You can see signs throughout the movie that show that although the plot may be off, the movie itself is very well made. I won't list all the little touches here and there, but the observant viewer will get a kick from them. All in all, as a movie, this is far better than it should be."
2,What's with the lips ?,Was I watching the same movie as the rest of you?Meg Ryan looks like a hag. Her hair is horrible herlips look like she's been sucking a vacuum cleaner hoseand she screeches through half of the movie.Jackman onthe other hand is smooth and every inch the duke. I noticedthe total lack of chemistry between them almost as muchI noticed that Ryan would have had an incestous relationshipwith her own great-great-grandson...This was no cosmic love story ...too bad could have been much better.
2,Im so sorry,Im sorry to say But i saw this movie on my 13th birthday with a girlyfriend of mine and my Big sis and My mom. I was literally looking @ my clock every 5 minutes! It is so boring! Im sorry I didn't like it at all.
3,A little silly,"A contemporary case of time travel lands the Duke Leopold of Albany (1870-era chivalrous dude) in Manhattan, 2001. He falls in love with Kate, and then the whole time issue becomes the question of, if this affair is to endure, which of them will make the switch, because it's clear that, well, to tell more would be to tell too much.A little hokey, a little silly, but it's fun enough for an evening at home."
3,Watch this for Hugh...,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie and while it was worth the cost to see a stunningly handsome and realistic Hugh Jackman as a 19th century lord transported to modern-day New York, I have to say the rest of the movie is a let-down. I just did not buy Meg Ryan in her role (this type supposedly being her forte). I found her annoying and unbelievable. And forgive me, but when did the great love happen? Did I miss something? Overall, it was a cute story idea and Hugh Jackman as well as the other castmembers (excluding Ryan) were quite good. I just didn't buy this particular fairy tale."
5,good movie,"saw this along time ago but couldn't find it anywhere. glad i found it here, i bought it immediately and have watched it multiple times"
3,Good story,"Not to much romance - could have used a few more kisses ;-) Hugh, of course is always awesome. Meg's hair looked like crap throughout the whole movie. What's up with that?"
3,Worth Seeing,"I like Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, so I figured seeing the two in a movie would be pretty interesting. Well, as far as romantic comedies go, this one was okay. Meg Ryan's charachter was pretty flat and typical, but Hugh Jackman really stole the show, playing the duke from 1876 who travels forward in time by accident. The plot is sort of cheesy, and i didn't really think their falling in love was convincing.Kate & Leopold is a fun movie to watch if you have some freetime or something, but don't be expecting the whole ""you'll laugh, you'll cry"" thing."
3,When sci-fi met romantic comedy . . . Hmmmmm,"When Leopold met Kate? Sleepless in 20th century New York? I wish I could give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars.It's a romantic comedy with a sci-fi twist, which I found interesting. However, the interest slowly died there. I thought Hugh Jackman played the ultimate leading man . . . handsome, suave, easy on the eye (almost forget he was Wolverine in that other movie) . . . The supporting cast, especially the guys who play Kate's brother Charles/Charlie and poor Stuart, were great (in fact they made the movie for me). Meg Ryan was sweet, as usual; but I didn't cheer for her in this movie as I did in when ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Sleepless in Seatle"" . . . Perhaps she played too many quirky romantic heroines . . . who knows?Kate & Leopold is nice and seems familiar . . . but fun and sweet in a strange, sci-fi kind of way. Rent it first . . . then you decide."
3,Conformable as other household Kates,"Again Meg Ryan returns to the silver screen in another implausible and sappy romantic comedy as another Kate (remember French Kiss?) to again act cute and have her character's ideas about love and relationships proven very wrong by the irresistible leading man. This woman has actually built a career on being cute! It's almost irritating how cute she is - almost. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman's Leopold is the dashing and completely refreshing saving grace of the picture. And the plot, though highly implausible, works on the romantic fantasy level and serves as the film version of the everyday woman's mental escape. Frankly, were it not for Hugh Jackman I would not have gone to see this film - or rented the DVD for the behind the scenes look at the film. Though it is a seeming trite and recycled sort of story - with the same characters, it is a good movie because it does have a certain amount of honesty and plenty of heart. It's good - very good, but not great."
3,WHEN KATE MET LEOPOLD...,"THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE FILM ON THIS DVD. THEATRICAL AND DIRECTOR'S CUT. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. KATE AND LEOPOLD IS ENJOYABLE ENOUGH THAT... YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END. HOWEVER, NOT MUCH HAPPENS. LIEV SCHREIBER IS A SCENE STEALER, AND THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS ARE GREAT AS WELL. THE FILM BELONGS TO HUGH JACKMAN (LEOPOLD) WHO IS BECOMING A MAJOR MOVIESTAR WITH EACH PICTURE HE DOES. ON THE FLIP SIDE THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABSENCE OF LEOPOLD'S COUNTERPART (KATE) PLAYED BY MEG RYAN. SHE IS WONDERFUL WHILE SHE'S ON SCREEN. BUT SHE'S NOT ON SCREEN AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK. LITE ON BOTH COMEDY AND ROMANCE THE FILM WILL DO ON A SLOW NIGHT AT THE VIDEO STORE, IF YOU'VE ALREADY RENTED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S KINDA LIKE ""WHEN HARRY MET SALLY"" MEETS ""BACK TO THE FUTURE"", BUT NOT AS REWARDING AS EITHER. ALL AND ALL WORTH SEEING FOR A TERRIFIC CAST."
2,For Rent 12 Rooms w/view,"The title of this review is one of the biggest flaws in a picture that really requires you to suspend disbelief. Forget the fact that his ex- lives one floor up and still waltzs in his fire escape window to claim her stuff anytime she wants (ever hear of locks on the window in NY?) This guy has no apparent job, and yet he can afford to furnish a 12 room aparment with a river view in NYC? What does he have rent control from the 20's? Why is it in every New York movie, any person central to the film has a beautifully decorated apartment with a view of a river. The only poor people ever seen are either there to provide that bit of squalor to make the film seem dark or to show the nobility of poverty. K & L is a typical meet cute film set in the fantasy land of the beautiful people...pity life is not like this."
2,OK romantic comedy only has Jackman holding it together,"Duke Leopold, played by Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing, X-Men Movies) gets sucked from his century to the present century 2001 because Stuart, Liev Schreiber (The Scream Triology, Manchurian Candidate 2004) found this time portal and Jackman was sent back with him. So, Leopold gets an eye full as he sees the future and all the surroundings (tvs, video cameras, walking the dog and so forth). Enter Stuart's Ex-Girlfriend Kate, played by Meg Ryan (In The Cut, Against The Ropes) who lives below him, she falls in love with Leopold and so forth. OK romantic comedy only has Jackman holding it up together and Breckin Meyer (Garfield, Road Trip) who is amusing as Kate's Actor Brother Charlie. Also starring Natasha Lyonne (Blade Trinity, Americn Pie 1 and 2) and Bradley Whitford (Tv's The West Wing, Billy Madison). It's passible but it doesnt have the goods I was expecting and someof it is down right corny"
5,Excellent Chick Flick Movie,I saw this movie with my family and i expected a good movie and it was really good. This is one of my favorite movies in the category of romantic comedies. I think that girls and guys will like this one for a date movie. It will make you think a lot about the life that you live. It is also very well made. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman do really good acting jobs as well. The story is very interesting with a kind of science fiction twist to it as well.
2,2 stars is generous,"I think 2 stars is generous here. As dumb romantic comedies go, this one was really really dumb. While I love romantic comedies in general, and often quite like these 'time traveling' films, I don't think they could have come up with a more stupid idea than jumping off a certain spot on a bridge to go back in time. Come on! If that wasn't bad enough, they have Meg Ryan's character falling in love with the 19th century guy (Hey, I'm not giving anything away, this was all in the commercials for the film) just because he opens doors for her. Give me a break. For a good romantic comedy, see:WHEN HARRY MET SALLYANNIE HALLHOLIDAY (Katherine Hepburn/Cary Grant)SABRINA (the original w/ Audrey Hepburn)TO CATCH A THIEFTHE APARTMENT...or... for a time-traveling comedy:BACK TO THE FUTUREPEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED"
2,A solid C-,"I can only give this a solid C-. Not only was the movie extremely jagged and discontinuous but in one key scene Leopold attempts to one up the villian by displaying how much he knows about opera. Unfortunately, Leopold was from 1876 and the opera he chose was La Boheme which was written in 1895. (Perhaps the world's easiest job is to be a Hollywood fact checker). Only to be watched if in the throes of severe movie withdrawl."
4,A fun sci-fi romance,"""Kate and Leopold,"" directed by James Mangold, combines a time-travel plot device with a sweet comic romance. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman play the title characters, a contemporary research and marketing executive and a 19th century nobleman.Although Ryan is effective, it's Jackman's performance that really carries the film. He is marvelously funny and charming in his ""fish-out-of-water"" role. Those who are fans of Jackman's moody, intense performance as Wolverine in ""X-Men"" will be in for a stunning surprise if they see him as this witty, cultured character. In addition to nice interplay with Ryan, Jackman also has a great ""buddy"" chemistry with Breckin Meyer in a supporting role.Liev Schreiber brings unexpected depth to his largely comic supporting role. His character's speech explaining a scientific epiphany is particularly good. ""Kate and Leopold"" is a pretty light film, but it's quite satisfying."
5,Old fashioned romance,I'm always a sucker for romances where the woman does whatever it takes to be with her man. I guess that's how I think it should be ... Smile.
2,"One good movie, one bad movie","When I bought this two-pack, I hadn't seen Pearl Harbor, but my friends said it was good so I figured it was worth the price. I was wrong. Pearl Harbor is an awful movie; bad acting, bad directing, bad writing, bad action sequences, everything about it was just bad. With The Rock, it's the exact opposite; good acting, good directing, good writing, good action sequences, everything about it was good. I have no complaints about The Rock. It's a fabulous movie. Pearl Harbor: *1/2 The Rock: ***1/2"
5,Shadows of Forgotten Cinema,"One of the few films that I've seen that has a firm grasp for purist cinematic symbolism. The imagery is advanced for its time, influentially important, and yet remains stunning in comparison with films of today; its simply amazing. It's no doubt that this filmmaker was one of the few that Tarkovsky would acknowledge as a competent contemporary. I recommend this film to anyone who wishes to be challenged by a pure cinematic dialog."
1,Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,Am Ukraininan myself but found this to be a totally boring uninspiring movie. Will have to look at it again
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An incredibly slow and rather simplistic movie that tries to coast on the novelty of its visuals, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors can't hide the fact that it's really pretty boring: see a bunch of other Soviet movies before you dull yourself with this one."
3,Erroneous description of this classic film,"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (Special Edition) (1964) (Sub)The information about this classic film posted by Amazon contains important errors of fact.First of all, the film is NOT in Russian, but in UKRAINIAN.Note to Amazon: PLEASE CORRECT THE LANGUAGE CLASSIFICATION!Second: The story is not about ""Russian regional history"" as the writeup states. The Carpathian Mountains are nowhere near Russia. Its Hutsul people speak Ukrainian and are among the least russified in all of the former Soviet Union.Third: What brought director Parajanov into conflict with communist authorities was not his prtrayal of harsh relities of Soviet life, but his stubborn insistence on filming his adaptation of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky's 1911 Ukrainian-language novel in the authentic Ukrainian language of the region, and refusing to dub it into Russian.These errors of fact mislead Amazon customers and tend to perpetuate the myth that all of the Soviet Union was Russia."
4,Just beautiful!,"These are gorgeous shoes and the wedge is a very comfortable height. They do run just a tad small--sort of narrow over the area below the toes. So much so that I will likely have them stretched before I try to wear them for longer than 3-4 hrs.Otherwise, they are lovely and of lovely quality, too."
4,My Review,I picked this book up for a book report thinking it was gonna be pretty boring but it was actually pretty good. it was nicely written and had a great story. Its a good book and I recommend it for most people.
5,Roller Coaster of Adventure and Surprises,This is the best thriller book I have read about Afghanistan better then Sleeping with the Leon. It's a very accurate portrayal of the freedom fighters (Mujahidin) in Afghanistan and all the foreign governments and entities involved during the ten-year war.The writer has managed to combine both the political story of the war and the personal journey of Mr. Abdullah Akbar. Mr. Akbar's story takes you thru three continents and it's a thrilling ride of adventure suspense and greed. This book will defiantly cost you the night...
5,The Best!,"I have read numerous mystery/adventure books by authors such as Tom Clancy & John Grisham. After reading this book I found it to be as exciting, interesting, adventurous, & suspenseful. I always looked forward to picking up where I stopped each time. The way the story is put together also gives the reader a very educational insight on the culture & history of Afghans and there rebellion strength & courage. I would highly recommend this book to others."
5,Another classic Green Lantern,"First of all I dont know how long that other writer has been reading Comics but I've been a fan going on 40 yrs. This edition of the Green Lantern(and I've seen them all) is a thrilling masterpiece filled with terrific artwork&coloring capped off with a great storyline. As far as that other writers comments on Superman..Always Remember..He(Superman) was the first..and he'll always be the King dude!,any TRUE Comicon ( a personally penned term for a true ""Connoisseur"" of comics not simply a ""Johnny come lately"") would know this fact! As a collector of Comics for decades(and like fine wine I'm getting tastier&better as time strolls on..ironic,same as my comic collection.) I can highly reccommend this edition."
5,The Client,"Susan Sarrandon, and Tommy Lee Jones at their best! An excellent film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and biting your nails. Suspenseful and gripping story of a young man that hires Susan as his attorney to help his family situation. Excellent film!"
3,Entertaining but unsatisfying,"Slick coutroom drama from John Grisham's novel.The story: Two kids witness a suicide and one of them hears a confession by the man. The Feds want him as witness, the mob wants him dead before he can tell anyone what the mafia lawyer told him before his death. A tough female lawyer defends him thus putting her own life at risk.The movie is always entertaining thanks to Joel Schumacher's direction but is not always satisfying, especially in the climax which would be more appropriate in a MacGyver episode. Tommy Lee Jones is good as the federal prosecutor nicknamed 'Reverend' for his habit of quoting parts of the Bible. Susan Sarandon's Oscar-nomination for her performance was well deserved, her scenes with the kid (played by Brad Renfro) are particularly good."
2,"Academic, dry, boring","Well, Grisham's book are being filmed more often than he changes his socks, so it's quite clear that the quality of films is changeful. This film is actually pretty high quality film to be honest. Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones offer their bassic quality performances, and the surroundings are high quality. But, the movie is lacking something that would make it truely likeable: SOUL. Without soul it turns out to be an academic boredom such as here. Now, it is just a straight filmation of the book, and there aren't much space to variate to make it watchable. You see, entertaining to read doesn't necessarily mean it's entertainig - or at least rewarding - to watch."
2,A packed interpretation,"I didn't really enjoy the screen version of John Grisham's ""The Client""...If you're planning to see this movie, I suggest you read the book first so that you'll understand more of the characters because the movie missed a lot of important details from the book...Moreover, Susan Sarandon's character was not really the Reggie Love I had on my mind...Brad Renfro's character was tougher than the Mark Sway in the book,, I didn't even feel concern for him in the movie...My sister, who was watching it with me was always asking me questions like ""What's she doing?"", ""What did he say?"" ""Why's she crying?""...The movie was indeed, very, very fast-paced."
4,An old classic still holding up to time.,First saw it on TV years ago. But picked it up as a DVD recently and enjoyed watching it again. Holds up well over time but is showing some bear threads as technology seems to be interfering not just time with older movies in the 70-80's era. But it's a keeper for now and might re-watch at a later time.
4,The Client,"I rented this movie as a helpful addative to a school project. I found that the movie was awesome, yet the producers totally messed up the end. I love how the book ended, and i was looking forward the the ending, but it came and went. If you liked the book, you will love the movie."
4,The Client,"The Client is one of the best films of the decade. It's a good film because the acturs are very well-known. The film is very suspense-packed. It's very good, when in a film, a little boy clears a case. The viewer sees the film in an other position. They intentify with the actors. That's the recipe of every film and you have made it."
4,The Client,"I think the Client is one of the best stories by John Grisham. The film is very thrilling and interesting, but I find it a pity, that many good scenes are missing on DVD. The actors play their roll very well. So the viewer can sympathize with the persons concerned."
3,Read the Book it tells a better story,"John Grisham is one of my favorite writers and he tells great stories. Unfortunately the book and movie don't exactly follow the same script. The movie could have captured more important moments of the book. There was no suspense like the book had. A big section of the story was left out towards the end. All in all, good acting but the script was lacking. If you have read the book, lower your expectations before watching the movie."
2,Read the book-it is much better.,"After reading the book first, the movie was very disappointing. This tends to happen since most screen adaptations leave out certain particulars and add or change details to make it more ""movie friendly"". Lesson learned-don't bother to see the movie if you have already read the book. You will be disappointed. Books are subjective and the characters and plot are played out in each individuals mind, left to our own creativity."
4,"Silly, but fun","Though this is not great drama or anything, ""The Client"" is a very entertaining popcorn movie. Great for a Friday night at home."
3,Like most Grisham adaptations on film... Mediocre,"The storyline is interesting but the execution is mundane. I've seen worse but i've seen much better.I do highly recommend The Rainmaker (a Grisham adaptation) directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Jon Voight, and Danny Devito. Best Grisham on film yet."
2,It was okay. Not great.,"I really liked the movie. The thing is, now that I've read the book, I see how much different the two are. Events are at totally different times, the movie has wrong names. If you want the true story of ""The Client"", read the book."
2,Not wonderful,The Client was a disappointment.I thought the book was very good and some of the characters in the book were outstanding. The movie was not coherent and certainly not at the level of the book.
5,The Client,Oldie but goodie. I loved this movie and had to order it when I noticed it on Amazon. One of those I can watch time and time again.
1,No Justice,"Read the book, the movie cannot come close, what they call filming/director license should be revoked. the most/bad rendition ever."
5,Fabulous movie.,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Great Grisham plot, great directing and acting. Am glad we have it in our library."
3,Good book for those who want to learn to re-trim hats.,This book concentrates on basic hat trimming techniques. It is not for the advanced milliner except as a source of ideas.
5,Great Product despite reported problems,"Purchased this drive about two months ago and have found it to be the best (and cheapest) option for massive amounts of storage. Despite some reported problems in various reviews, I have not had even one problem with this drive and routinely use it to back up my hd and to store multimedia like MP3's. At $ for each 2.2gig cartridge, the ORB can't be beat!"
3,a bit self indulgent,"Although I am very familiar with the time and culture he sets this story in, I found the first third of the novel poorly written, far too wandering. When he embraces Starr and the social set, and the real movie making, he gets his teeth into it and his writing improves tremendously. The first third reads like a writer filling space, but it got so much better that I wished he'd gone back and sharpened the opening he'd tossed off. That said, the rest is hilarious, and a very true picture of the time and industry."
4,A little short of jazz,"This is a good album worth getting. However, it leans toward pop rather than jazz. The arrangements are nice (on some songs the orchestra is led by Johnny Richards), but do not allow for much soloing from orchestra members. If you are looking for Teddi King in more of a jazz setting I would check out her work on Now In Vogue, where she is backed by a septet including Billy Taylor, Bob Brookmeyer, Nick Travis, Milt Hinton, Sol Schlinger, Gene Quill and Osie Johnson."
5,Wonderful book,"The Pythons were like the British Marx Brothers, Anti-authority,subversive, surreal, and very very funny. Particularly interesting are the Python's accounts of their childhood and pre-fame days.It seems ""A Careful Reader"" wasn't so careful after all. The picture of Dudley Moore (and it is most assuredly him) is on page 68 NOT 88. Here's a clue for ACR...he's about 30 years younger than he was when he appeared in the movie ""10."" Thank you and good night!"
1,Hmm...,"I hesitate to give the doc 3 stars, because it is very slow paced and spends way too much time looking at the narrator sitting in front of monitors in a studio. The guy's a little annoying. You could play a drinking game in which you must drink every single time he says, ""Question!"" prior to posing a question. It's too long, sometime overly belaboring and reviewing it's points. Unless you're a child, you may want to yell, ""I get it already!"" The main reason for the stars is that if you've got the time, it DOES raise some darn intriguing questions that I'd like to hear answers to. I'm like the reviewer who went into this thing thinking, ""Oh, c'mon!"" But there's some real evidence here that we do not know a good deal about exactly what happened that day. If you have the time & patience, you should hear what the doc has to say.UPDATE: just search for ""911 conspiracy debunked"" on google and I think you'll find reasonable answers for most questions this program raises. I downgrade it to 1 star."
2,Need to get some facts straight.,"The people who made this need to really get some simple facts straight. They try to convince you that something was attached to the second plane that hit the WTC. Are these people retarded??? If you look at pictures of the older United Airlines (blue and grey) planes they all have 2 silver strips on the bottom of the aircraft. Then they try and say it was not an airliner but possibly a military jet and go on to try and brain wash you more with a useless clip of a woman yelling ""That was not American Airlines"" Well yeah... because it was a United Airlines jet. Who knows why the lady was yelling that though it was a crazy time annd she probably didn't realize what she was saying anyway.Some of this is very interesting though so I gave it two stars."
5,Adult learns with children,This picture dictionary has been a huge help for an Iraqi mom and her children who have been in the USA for only one year.
2,not for none speaking arabic people,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IF YOU NEEDED TO KNOW THE ARABIC WRITTEN WORD FOR ITEMS OR SITUATIONS, THERE IS NO PHONIC KEY FOR PEOPLE LEARNING ARABIC TO PRONOUNCE THE WORDS."
3,ESL Dictionary,"This book is organized by subject (""the home"", ""shopping"") with labeled and coloured pictures. It is part of a series for different language speakers and is best used in schools for beginning English speakers. We were using it for a newly arrived arabic-speaking family. It helped to provide some basic vocabulary, but if you are translating a particular word you have to know in what vocabulary grouping the word has been placed. It will give the family a way of practising, though, by using the things around them and making sentences. This is a pleasant, bright, and comfortable learning resource and reasonably priced."
4,Better Resource to learn English than Arabic,"I bought this dictionary when I was trying to learn a little Arabic to get ready to travel to the Middle East for a semester abroad. It was helpful in many ways(because of the pictures), but it lacked the phoenetic spellings of the Arabic words that I needed to use it for conversation. I took the book with me to Jordan, and ended up leaving it there with a friend who is trying to learn English, because he found it more helpful than I did."
5,A great tool,"For an Arabic speaking person learning English or an English speaking person learning Arabic, it is essential. Don't leave home without it."
3,my comment,"it is a good books with a nice price, but the problem is that i had payed around 50 usd here in Denmark to get it! it is the tax here..because USA is not in EU.What is a shame!!"
2,"Sketchy, full of assumption",This started off for the newbie but quickly assumes you have run Linux before. Not a lot of detail in the area of text commands which is like old DOS and the core of the system. It did help in setup of the included CDs which I did not have a problem installing. All of the Linux distributions are quickly being snatched up by corporations making them more controlling just like the Microsoft empire. What every happened to Free or the idea of open source?
2,WARNING - BOOK SHIPS WITH DEFECTIVE CDs,"I spent alot of time trying to get the included disks to install on various computers, but none of them would boot off the included CD. I finally went to the Dummies website, and found that the CDs are MISLABELED - Disk one is actually disk 2, and disk 2 is actually disk 1. To install, you therefore need to place the second CD in the drive first and boot off that DVD. It would be nice if Amazon would place that info near the top of the listing so customers would know when ordering."
3,prodreview-20080223-4,It is a good book but too soon out of date. I had Red Hat Linux 9 and managed to get it installed and setup using the book but shortly there after an upgrade came out which made the book somewhat out-of-date. I would not recommend purchasing this book; nor would I recommend most computer books. They are too expensive for the little use you will get from them. Also; the Linux developers seem to have shot themselves in the foot. They had a good product which to compete with Microsoft Windows but they did not pursue it. Now you cannt even find Linux operating system.
4,oh that Mario !,"OK OK i confess, i bought the movie just to look at mario....but i really found that i liked the movie too !"
4,Don't mess with MARIO LOPEZ,"MARIO LOPEZ has very little patience when it comes to his mom. Don't even think about kidnapping his mom. MARIO LOPEZ will not be easily tamed, let alone, easily swayed. UNSTOPPABLE is MARIO LOPEZ. MARIO LOPEZ will never be OUTTA TIME. MARIO LOPEZ will make ICE CREAM SANDWICHES out of his nemesis, LOGAN. MARIO LOPEZ, AKA--MR. LOTHARIO, has had it up to here. Eight inches. MARIO LOPEZ is through playing games. No more games for MARIO LOPEZ. ENOUGH GAMES FOR MARIO LOPEZ!"
1,Low-quality,The price point on this product seems like a good deal At first it's probably because it's can it take you hours to assemble. It comes in many pieces and requires a fair amount of cutting of bolts and plastics to accommodate your door. Worst of all once assembled the product quickly fades and falls apart.
5,"Excellent resource, especially for women at midlife","Exemplary book written by a practicing cardiologist and Yaleprofessor. I found Dr. Kra's book to be an excellent resource,especially for women at midlife and in menopause. Dr. Kra supports his argument for HRT (hormone replacement therapy) in a clear and concise manner. The book is equally valuable to those who either choose not to or can't take HRT (hormone replacement therapy) for its informative segments on diet, exercise and ways in which to reduce one's chances of developing heart disease. I've recommended this book to the women of Power Surge. Dr. Kra was well-received when he guested in Power Surge, as we are all concerned about heart disease while we travel through this rite of passage - menopause."
1,they ruined a treasured 1980s classic,"The lowest rating you can give it is one star - it deserves none.When I found out that my childhood favorite, Strawberry Shortcake was back, I was so excited . . . until I went to the store and saw the new SSC toys and and this episode playing in the electronics center of my local wal-mart. I have the original dolls and a few of the original cartoons - this is NOTHING at all like the original SSC. I can't believe other people wrote reviews stating that the new SSC is the same as what they grew up with. It is NOT the SSC of the eighties - the voices are done by different people; the cartoons look nothing like the videos, coloring books, or stickers from the 80s; and the dolls, as most of today's dolls do, look anorexic in comparison to the originals. This is a very poor imitation for those looking for the SSC of the 80s. At least when they brought back the Care Bears, the cartoons were the same, and the plush dolls were the same or very similar."
5,IT SMELLS GREAT TOO!,"My 5 year old got this for Christmas from Santa. She was very excitted to get this movie, she had been wanting it for so long. When I opened it Christmas morning I was a bit surprised. I wasn't expecting the movie to smell like Straberry Shorcake. It was an added bonus.Thankfully my 5 year old and her 3 year old sister both love the movie. It is just the first to start our collection."
4,Daughter loves this movie,"My daughter was introduced to this movie by someone staying with her at the ronald mcdonald house in Chicago. She wanted to watch it when we got home. We couldn't find it. We went to the ronald mcdonald house again and the same thing, she couldn't watch it enough. Now we have it at home.The only bad thing about this is now the strawberry shortcake song is stuck in my head."
1,DO NOT buy this junk,I totally agree with the last reviewer. The dolls and the videos are nothing but garbage. They are a disgrace and an embarressment to the dolls and cartoons of the 80's. Whoever came up with the new straberry shortcake garbage should be ashamed of themselves. Whoever brought back the care bears thoug- did it right. They didnt try changing ANYTHING. The stuffed animals look exactly how l remember them. Its such a shame how they disgraced the fond memories I have of the classic Strawberry Shortcake. RIP Strawberry!
1,A Disgrace,"I think I should say first that a bold warning label should be on each of these new videos: ""CONTAINS POINTLESS PLOTS ALONG WITH WHINING AND SARCASTIC CHARACTERS THAT TEACH UNPLEASANT HABITS TO YOUNG CHILDREN.""These pointless plots contain contradictory statements such as ""better wait 'til after lunch"" when a cookie was requested even though they just emerged from a ""cookie factory"" (having eaten the whole time they were there), as well as encouraging children to eat chocolate when they are upset, and excusing rude and sarcastic comments with ""Oh, she has a good heart"". This is not even the HALF of it!! I NEED MORE ROOM!"
3,Interesting tales... bad writing.,"As someone interested in criminal law, this book was captivating and at times didactic. She is obviously a skilled defender, but sometimes her actions make her seem like she is willing to let murderers run free on a legal technicality. That's hardly admirable, but her hard work certainly is. The text is badly composed, with simple words and some unique grammar. That's why I say interesting book, bad writing. Don't read this book if you can't look past wierd sentence composure to nuggets of interesting criminal law stories."
2,For Biddle's Sake,"This was a very short book, and I thought it was kind of boring. But for young people, this is the book for you."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,It is a GREAT PRODUCT. It fit perfectly and matched my rifle. The function of it is great also. Thanks!
4,Nice Straps,"I thought these were gonna be pretty cruddy straps when I saw the price. But the straps are pretty comfortable, leather , and designed. I would've given it a five stars if the adjusting system wasn't confusing and aggravating. When I put it on, it was too big. So I took it off and tried to adjust but I couldn't figure out how to do it. I then saw the slits in the back of the strap and pulled out like a shoelace. Then I had to put it back in the slit and criss-cross it until I got to the edge. There's 2 attachments the thick strap with the design on it, and the really then part that goes into the slits on the thick part. But it feels great, looks cool, it's leeeaather, and it's a great price. I would recommend these straps"
4,"good, but not for my taste","bought it for my mom, she likes it, but i think it's too strong for a woman, that's my opinion."
5,Donnna Dewberry's Complete Book of One-Stroke Painting,This used book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. The information in the book itself was beautifully presented and very helpful. I was very happy with the seller's performance and product and would do business with this seller again. Great transaction.
2,great on stroke book,I am in love with this one stroke style of painting and I received the book on time and it was in great shape
2,The Voice of Inexperience,"I have no natural artistic talent and no art experience, so I thought this book which promises ""quick and easy techniques"" would be perfect for me. However, I've been practicing Donna Dewberry's techniques for two months and still can't perfect the brush strokes. My opinion is that the words ""quick and easy"" are false advertising and should be removed by the publisher."
5,Donna Dewberrys book,I watched some of Donna Dewberrys videos online. They were real interesting so I thought I'd order her book. Its terrific & was a great price.
3,An Okay book,"Not overly impressed. Thought there would be more help with a variety of flowers, design and technique for painting them."
3,Selected Guide to Noritake,"This, along with many other books on Noritake, seem to be weighted towards the USA. This Book is good, and a great guide to some aspects of Noritake, but I am still waiting on the ultimate thorough Noritake Worldwide Guide."
3,Why shouldn't I buy that book?,c'era una volta una gatta che aveva una macchia nera sul muso ed una barca vecchia come il cucco. Allora che revisione e' mai questa?Compratelo.Non ve ne pentirete
4,Good Vaccuum gauge,It's a pretty good accurate vacuuum gauge. The only downside is that the little white nozzles will sometimes stick into the vacuum lines and you have to use some pliers to get it out.
3,Good Value For the Money,"I've owned this oboe for about 4 years. I play flute and switched to oboe for community band. Yes, it has it's faults. The metal keys are soft and you have to be very careful handling it so you don't bend them. I have problems with the C# key, don't know if it is poorly placed or I just have bad fingers! (Probably both!). But for the price I think these are minor issues considering what you get. The tone quality is for the most part good and you get all the additional keys for the advancing player. If you are an adult and watch how you handle the instrument, I think this is a good buy for the intermediate player who doesn't want or can't afford to spend $3000 for an oboe. However, I would NOT recommend this oboe for a grade school musician! In the future, I hope to buy a Fox or Buffet, or similar quality oboe, but for the time being, I'm happy with my Barrington!"
3,Quasi technical docudrama without many details,"This quasi technical docudrama shows without many details a theory of building the Great Cheops (Khufu) Pyramid and life in ancient Pharaonic Egypt at that time based on the newest archeological discoveries and derived conclusions. The process of building is both dramatized and illustrated by elaborate animation, but the detailed structure of the pyramid is not shown. A model and a few schematics are presented.This elaborate, well made, and rich in the film set, costumes and props show is rather a story of a builder than of the detailed building process. It is on a quite low technical and scientific level, and watching it does not require much of knowledge or imagination. Maybe it was intended for children. ""The Pyramids - Jewels of the Nile (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)"" show also on DVD seems to be superior."
1,"This is a JOKE, right?","People, do your Self a favor and spend your money on something else. The decision to buy a ""product"" like this one strangely enables the producers and the companies who finance such things TO MAKE MORE OF THEM. Who needs that?Why support the claims and ""findings"" of a bunch of people who are simply out to make a buck by selling you their version of ""the truth behind the mystery""?Make no mistake, this production is pure fantasy. It doesn't even have value as ENTERTAINMENT FILLER. The best thing that we can all hope for is that once the intitial batch has been run, that the option to produce more of them will not be excercised at the pressing plant."
3,pretty good info,"The film was somewhat entertaining, I just didn't like not being able to download my rental to watch else where."
1,The Pyramids are Great but this DVD is not.,"I was really disappointed in this fictional presentation about the construction of the pyramids. There was very little factual information at all, rather a sociological posturing that those who built them actually anticipated providing their contribution to the project. When they stated that ""no slaves were used to construct the pyramids"" I think that the meaning of the word slave has been substantially redefined from what it really means. Some workers were skilled and probably paid. Others were prisoners of war who were forced to do labor work here. The volume of people required is so great we cannot really imagine how many were required. There was very little content about the mechanics of construction, which is what I was expecting from the title of the DVD. I would save my money and buy something else."
4,Top vid. geddit!,"""20 minutes into the future"". Strange how things turn out isn't it? In a post apocalyptic society where everything is owned by the corporations (sound familiar) you find a dedicated team of investigative journalists out to expose the underhand tricks by said corps to brainwash viewers of their adverts (to get even more sales) by showing outlawed ""blipverts"". Adverts with subliminal suggestions that overload our brains with info and cause the viewer to, erm... pop!.What a treat for retro fans and old crumblies like me that just won't let go :o) Oh yes, great 80s style soundtrack too - and, the good guys win - sort of. Well, at least the hyper geek, Bryce, gets his :o)Not your regular sci-fi but a good romp none-the-less and it's short enough (barely an hour) that makes the story gallop along at a fast enough pace that even if you hate it, you won't get bored."
5,MY Favorite BOOK of tricks.,"Being a teacher of fitness this book has become one of my favorite reference books. I use it often and my students often lovingly refer to ""THE BOOK"" whenever I try a new exercise. Note: this book was written in the 70's and reprinted up until the early 90's it is more based on a stronger Senior fitness class. You will find the exercises challenging even if you are not a senior and some you will ask yourself ""Is this really a senior exercise? WOW"" Honestly, one of the best books for physical fitness for seniors I have ever worked with and I have been teaching for over 11 years. I highly recommend. You will need to use your own creative nature to build your own classes. Although they give a format in back of book I have noticed that the format given was not favorable for my population of seniors."
2,No Software Updates (without Paying),"I bought this just a week ago and found out that a Software Update is coming at the end of this month. They are planning to charge $50 for this upgrade and it isn't free to recent buyers.Given the continuous need to improve this software, I think it is a little early for them to start charging for their upgrades. I would recommend holding on this purchase until they figure out the support strategy. Their CEO posted a comment on a COMMENT BOARD about a year ago promising that all updates are free to existing customers. This seems to be a change of policy.Bottom line, don't purchase this product with all the issues that are stating here and hope that the company will give you an update to improve. You won't want to spend $50 every year or every few months!"
5,FABULOUS,"Product received in a timely manner, condition of product in excellent condition - ""NEW"" as expected. I am very please with the total experience and outcome!"
3,hard to insall,"After over a week of emailing tech support, I gave up and paid a local computer store to install soft ware. Tech tried to be helpful but didn't have any idea how to do it. When I wrote them and told them it cost me $70 to finally get my product to work, Tech support wrote back ""we are so glad to help"" they are taking all the credit! ! ! Nothing but trouble."
1,Not Worth the Money,Good for quickly storing documents that you scan but takes a long time to scan a receipt then doesn't do that much automated processing but makes you wait a long time for that what little it processes. Can not put receipt items into different categories - whole receipt total goes in one category which isn't practical for me.
2,Net Scanner,"The NEAT scanner itself is cool. Its compact and scans great images. Also the company has great support. The software; however, is horrible unless you are just scanning receipts. Unfortunally, the scanner will not work with other software such as Paperport. If your intent is to scan receipts, then great. If you are going to do general scanning, then there are many many better choices. The Brothers DSmobile 700D is less expensive, will duplex and when combined with Paperport 14, is an awesome product."
2,very inacurate software,"The scanner works well and gives an acurate image.It is very small and would make a good take along scanner in particular with its use of USB power.However the software is woefully lacking in interpreting what is sees.It will often show whatever date is on the receipt wether it is the bought date, billed date, or a previous bill date.The same as with amount which may be any number it pics past or present. Likewise with tax.All this necessitates your going back in and correcting it on the form which to me defeats the purpose.This could be a great machine but the software needs work.Look at where the overall reviews fall and you'll get a feel for what the other users have experienced.Hopefully they'l work the bugs out as it does have potential."
3,Good - But be warned!,"The NeatReceipts product is useful, labor saving and fun to use. I bought it to clear a large backlog of unfiled trip expenses - it was neat to join forces with my 6 year old kid who found it amusing to scan receipts into the scanalizer, while I quickly validated, corrected and/or refiled missing numbers. The job felt like it took shorter than it would have, otherwise.But be warned of software glitches:1. Always check the Vendor, date and amount. Don't trust the software implicitly; it has a hit-or-miss rate of about 50%.2. There was some kind of software memory leak bug that just wiped out 150 receipts that I'd entered!! A good 4+ hours of work just disappeared. That I'm still using the product (exiting and restarting after every 10 receipts) is a testament to the value of the product.So use it -- but don't trust it."
3,Disappointing Quickbooks Interface,"I bought the device primarily to scan credit card receipts into QuickBooks. Frankly I am very disappointed with the interface to QuickBooks. While it scans and reads the receipts correctly in about 90%+ of the time, once it collects the information, getting that information into the correct Quickbooks accounts is just plainly too difficult to be practical. Instead of giving one a menu of accounts to send the data, it wants to send all the receipts into a single account. That would be fine for a home user putting all charges into a credit card, but it is not sufficient for a business user to have all receipts clumped into a single category."
3,Good idea - mediocre implementation,"The scanner here is worth about $120; so you're paying about $35 for the NeatReceipts software. That's probably the upper limit of what it's worth right now. It claims to be version 2.5, but feels more like an early beta - slow to load, frequent crashes, poor search function. This is potentially a useful package for compulsive record keepers. Scanner works fine, but software needs more development."
2,Neat Receipts,This caused more work than necessary. It did not take the receipt in full and had to keep adding in file amounts that did not print out.
2,"A good idea, but needs more work","I found the Neatreceipts scanner easy to use, but soon broke the first one I had by feeding in a regular (but slightly thicker) business card that got stuck in the unit. The software is clunky and it is difficult to save files into JPGs to print or send. Also the scanner feeds smaller papers in crooked most of the time, requiring you to hold the papers while scanning again and again. Also, I am using Windows Vista and had a very difficult time running the Windows Vista compatible software from their website -- so much so that I now am using it on a Windows XP machine to avoid the difficulties. I noticed too that they've come out with a 'new and improved' software version at their website -- but you have to pay for it! Overall, I'd say avoid this until they improve it -- unless you already do a ton of scanning with a flatbed scanner."
4,"great scanner, highly portable","Great device for cutting down on paper clutter. Main uses for me are receipts (I create a PDF of all receipts from a single trip and zip it with the expense report), for business cards which I sync with Outlook and for general notes -- I never have to worry about having the right paper folder along on a trip.Outlook sync for business cards is great but could map more fields or allow user to adjust the maping. For example, would like to map attachments and back of card (particularly Chinese cards) into Outlook."
1,DO NOT BUY. ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER SALE,"I used this handy scanner and software for three years. THEN....I had a problem. I could not access my database. I could not access one single receipt that I had gathered for a period of three years. I am still going through a very painful and drawn out series of emails with ""tech support"" in an effort to get the problem solved.Do not buy this software because there is absolutely NO technical support. There is no one to call. You can ONLY email. There is some outfit that responds to the emails from a ""Peduzzi Associates"" that seems to have nothing to do with Neat Receipts. They keep marking the ticket as ""solved"" even when I am waiting for a response FROM THEM.STAY AWAY. STAY FAR AWAY."
4,The Best Investment I made,"I read all the reviews before purchasing and knew that there might be a few glitches. However, I got it and my husband and I loved it so much we bought another one. He takes it with him when he travels and I have mine here in our home office. I have told so many of our business associates and they to have purchased one and love it. They only reason I rate it a 4 star is because I feel that there is always room for improvement and I cant what to see what they add."
5,Neat Receipts,I love the product it is great. I just wish it had a higer success rate populating fields. But this is a minor nusance.
2,NeatReceipts,"The product did not live up to my expectations after a strong plug by a QuickBooks Proadvisor. I found the folder storage awkward and inadequate. The scanner did not read the amounts accurately. It didn't ""learn"" by reading the same type of receipt multiple times. There was too much data entry to do after the receipt was scanned which completely defeated the entire purpose for me purchasing the machine: cut down data entry time of receipts into QuickBooks.The product was very easy to link to QuickBooks and export but it exported the entries as general journals which is not an acceptable quality of bookkeeping for me.There are precious few user instructions, as well.My conclusion is that it is completely inadequate from a professional standpoint. It might have some value to an individual who wants to replace their paper receipts with electronic copies. But that's about it."
2,Scanner for what purpose ?,"Before buying a receipt scanner like this, ask yourself how you plan using it.We've used the Visioneer Paperport Scanner for over 10 years for my wife's tax practice. We scan all documents we get from the clients as backup. The Visioneer performed well for us. It was fast. We never used any character recognition as speed was the key feature we wanted. We had a preXP model so we had to upgrade.This is where we made the mistake of buying the neatreceipts. We thought it was going to be fast as visioneer. Even with the character recognition off, it was damn slow.Completely unacceptable. But in all fairness to neatreceipts, it might be a good scanner for somebody looking for OCR scanner to link to expense reports etc. If you need speed and you have a lot of documents, sad to say this is not the one. FOr a few receipts each time, maybe OK.So it goes back for a return."
2,"not user friendly, won't load on my new pc","I bought a while ago and now am upgrading my home pc, the install disc won't load on new pc, my options are to purchase a $30 upgrade, supposedly the free upgrade is not available. Plus the scanner software is not very intuitive. I'm trying to ""find"" my receipt database to put on the new pc and it's difficult to find.For the money, this scanner should have better software."
2,Not all it is claimed to be,"This scanner does a decent job of scanning materials and is portable. However the software provided with the scanner is bloated, cumbersome and in the case of business cards not very effective.Compared to the business card software provided with, for example, the CardScan brand of products the Scanalizer software is of limited functionality, does not provide for easy reconcilliation of card data nor does it allow for easy segregation of cards into different ""buckets"", e.g. by trade show or by activity grouping. In addition the display and search capabilities for the card data is neither attractive or efficient.If the scanning and management of business cards is a significant part or your reason for considering this product - then don't buy it. Instead look at one of the business card specific products and make sure the card database meets your needs."
1,Neat Scanner not all that,"I was very excited about this scanner. I purchased from Amazon because it was cheaper. The disk that came with the scanner did not work with my Mac, even though I purchased the Mac version. I tried to download software directly from Neat.com, but the product key on the disk I purchased from Amazon did not work with the Neat website. Neat won't provide service since I did not buy it from them. I don't have the box as I am traveling and had to discard, so now I can't return it. Waste of time and money."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE!,"I purchased this product about a year ago thinking that it would be great to organize my many business receipts. I painfully scanned in a couple of boxes of receipts and shredded the paper copies. Later I got a ""software update"" notification from NeatReceipts. When I tried to ""update"" the database software, the program froze with a messsage to contact tech support. I had a very difficult time getting through to tech support. When I did, they could not assist me in getting the product to work NOR recover the ""database"" with my receipts!!! I've lost all the receipts that I scanned!! Now I just hope I don't get audited! Don't waste your time nor money with this product."
5,My new best friend!,"This is a pretty good product that is saving me between 1 and 2 hours a week in creating my expense reports. The OCR software is a little slow and sometimes does not recognize dates and amounts, but even though it presents the receipts in an easy way to correct if anything is wrong. The best feature in my opinion is the exporting, for instance you can generate xls files if you need to do some math and pdfs. It is also very portable, so if you are on the go it also helps. I haven't tried the business card feature."
1,Still can't get it to work with MS Vista.,I finally got the Vista Beta version installed but still can't get my neat receipts to work. I see that a fully operational Vista version is coming in July. I hope I will be able to download that version and get it to work. I was really excited about this product and hope I can get it to work in the future.
4,Good Product,Works pretty easy but needs to be Mac compatible there is a hole other market out there that can use this product with tons of receipts that need to be scanned!
2,Bad software. Do not buy. Poor excuse for a DMS,I purchased this scanner and then the upgrade to 3.0. It will not allow importing of .PDF's even though it touts great .PDF support. Customer support is non existant and they do not stand behind there product. I am sure there is much better hardware out there as well. I would suggest staying away from this product. After asking for a refund they disabled my forum account and will not give a refund. How do you like that. The fox gurding the hen house. Poor busness ethic.
1,DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY WINDOWS 64 BIT VISTA OR XP MEMORY HOG,"Website does not specify until I complained that 64 bit windows of any kind is not supported although the box and amazon and everywhere else says it will work with ""Windows Xp"" it does not include what builds it will work on and the ones it wouldnt. Please Make sure you have correct version so you dont have this problem. They will refund your money but is that really an answer to the problem? NOUpdate: I loaded it on a Machine Dedicated to this software and it only. The database takes approx. 1mb per receipt. So if your like me, i have thousands of receipts and will continue to gather them. I would recomened a large amount of free space on your hard drive, and also a away to back them images up(software provides an option or you can export from inside it)"
2,Slow scanner and unreliable software,The scanner that comes with this software is not well suited for scanning pages quickly. It crawls through the process. I spent an hour scanning cards and receipts only to find that they all dissappeared the next time I ran the software.
2,Great Idea - bad execution,"I bought the product with anticipation of organizing my receipts and simplifying my life - I installed the product but could not get it to work. I called the help desk for help but they could not help me and escalated me to level 2 support, Level One Help Desk support can only help minimally and are very light with product and computer knowledge - level 2 support can only help you during business hours so I would need to take a day off to get someone to help me get it up and running - so if you want good product support - they need to do alot better!"
3,not worth the money,"I can't recommend Neat Receipts for my clients. For the money it just doesn't do enough; it scans slow, it only scans one side at a time, business cards don't fill correct fields as often as it sould. For the money I have recommended my clients buy Scan Snap from Fujitsu; it scans super fast, scans both sides at once, creates a contact in your Outlook when you scan the business card, converts all docs to ""searchable"" (very important when looking for a specific receipt!), also scans all docs for those of you wanting to convert to a ""paper-less"" office. So basically, I ask, ""Why buy something that ONLY scans receipts and one page docs?"" If you are going to scan, buy something that can scan ANYTHING and then convert it to a searchable-saved file.Just my thoughts :)"
3,"Pretty good, but no flatbed","Can't complain about the product because the limitations I've found seem to be general to the product variety and suffered by all. The feed mechanism doesn't always feed the sheet in straight and there are several scans that have black at the top right and bottom left, but the software attempts to correct for this as much as possible in the rendering phase. I would very much recommend upgrading to the new version 4 of the software as the database engine is much more stable and manages several scans in the queue.I find the portability to be much more of an advantage than a picture perfect image as you would get on a flatbed-type."
4,NeatReceipts Scanalizer,"Great product for reducing the sheer mountain of paper a person collects each day/week/month while being able to maintain needed records for personal/tax purposes. The scanner is a nice compact size and handles most receipts easily on the first try, even the ones that have been folded, scrunched, twisted and then straightened out. The only thing I would like it to do, and I haven't figured out how to do it if it can, is maintain the addresses with the vendor names so I don't have to retype in that info each time. The software help menu is okay, but could be a little better."
1,Scanner and Software don't work.,The software and scanner were 2005 versions that do not work with Windows 64 bit software. I have had to spend much time with tech support. Very cumbersome to uninstall old version before installing the updated version. I had to actually delete files from my system registry AFTER uninstalling through windows. After this was successfully done the scanner still did not work. Contacted tech support again. Had to delete more files in the system registry. Scanner still does not comunicate with the software.
3,Has some limitations,Covienent size. Scans ok. Software ok. Had problem scanning an orange receipt. Poor support. Answer was will not scan orange and could not manually enter data.
3,Resource HOG,It is such a resource HOG that it is three as fast to just put your receipts back in a file box!!!
5,Great product for many different uses (not just receipts).,"I am a consultant and I bought this product for scanning receipts. It does a great job for that, but I have found that it is great for scanning just about anything that you want into a PDF file. I am satisfied with the product, but be certain that you have the recommended memory to run the software. The MS database that it uses is a memory hog. Be cautious of this on upgrades, since each update/upgrade usually requires more memory than the previous one."
2,Complicated and not worth the money.,I sent it back. It's just something else to clutter my desk. I have a 3/1 printer that scans just fine!
5,Great products for taxes,"This item works great for what I needed. I did not need the reports etc. but to have a scanner this small is a must for me. I am a daycare provider and we own a home which we rent one apartment so we need to keep A LOT of reciepts. Every year most of them have faded by the time I do the taxes or we realize some are missing. With this item.. I scan them then throw them out!! Never lose a receipt, less clutter with our paper work, no bulky scanner, and they never fade! Highly recommed"
5,Neat Reciepts,"It's what I have been waiting for I'm using the daylights out of it. I just wish it was faster.Also have those OCR guys see if they can begin to read hand writing on the reciepts too. If not, it's OK because I can't even begig to tell you home much time I'm saving.Thanks So much for a wonderful productDrew FoleyDrew Foley Consturction Co."
1,Poor product,"Tried to get it hooked up and even called neat receipt support 3 times. It was hard getting software to work with turning off firewalls etc. After getting it hooked up and ready to scan, it wouldn't scan. Tried for 3 days and still no scan. Now I want to return to Amazon and will only get back 50% of my $180 purchase. What a rip off. It was a gift and doesn't work."
3,"Good Scaner, But Does Not Work Well with Quicken","It works as a great scanner and it makes great travel reports from recipts, but it does not work well with quicken."
4,great timesaver,this product is long overdue - a great saver of both time and space - and a great asset to anyone looking to organize and actually run their finances. software could do better at recognizing dates that are written with the month abbreviated instead of numerical and it gets bogged down with receipts that are created with dots - especially useful with thermal receipts that aren't left in the sun - once those fade they become almost impossible to read. all in all and excellent product and value - well done
3,NeatReceipts,"Does not always ""read"" correctly so check your dollar amounts, names on business cards, etc.I am very happy with the product."
1,Very Disappointed! Don't Waste Your Money,"I'm a Quicken and Quickbooks user. I purchased this product with the hopes that I could save time entering receipts. What a disappointment. Yes you can download into Quickbooks but ONLY as a journal entry. I guess if that's where you put your purchases and don't use the checking or register features in QB, it might work for you. Also the dates on receipts did not capture correctly and I had to hand change them. I was also expecting a little more line item detail capture and Neat Receipts doesn't do that either. A category for sales tax is shown but you have to hand enter the sales tax. It will not capture it.If you are looking for a time saver, keep looking. This product is NOT the answer."
1,Don't buy this,"I was so impressed by the demo I saw at the airport kiosk that I could not wait to get back home to buy one of these gadgets. I ordered it from Amazon, and it arrived in record time. I set it up, loaded the software, then tried unsuccessfully to scan receipts and business cards. The paper got stuck, jammed, the computer froze up and the entire process stalled. I tried many times to get it to work. Reinstalled the software, set everything up just the way the instructions said - no luck. I even did a clean reinstall of my operating system, just in case I had a computer error. I am no computer novice, but this gadget just did not work. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return and to refund my money. I am very grateful to them, and deeply disappointed in the Neatreceipt. What a time saver ot would be - if it only worked. Perhaps my machine was just a dud - and I hope that is true. But I just did not want to take another chance."
4,still time consuming,"It still takes time to scan, correct, categorize (and possibly adjust the image and/or rescan) each receipt. It does organize, and prints up a nice report for you. Wish it had ""drag and drop"" instead of cut and pasting all the time. Maybe in future versions of the software."
4,order out of chaos,"I read most of the reviews before I purchased this scanner, I agree that the software is a bit slow, and that it isn't perfect on some of the lettering styles and reciept formats. However that being said, I love it. It has done most of the reciepts I have put through with much more accuracy than I was expecting, the variables for modifing lists in the programmng are more than adequate for the needs of our small business and I don't have to handle the reciepts more than once."
3,Neat Receipts,Neat Receipts is a great concept but I find that the program is rather slow and the screen isn't laid out well.
1,Horrible Setup,"I have been trying for two days to install the ver 3.1.3 software for the scanner. NeatReceipts only provides Tech support via the internet (unless you pay). The response has been slow and the instructions provided have not worked. As a professional database programmer, I hope that I never release a product that is this buggy."
2,"Less than expected, too many scan errors","Software is uninspired with an overwhelmingly convoluted user interface. Scanner hardware is small, light, but mediocre, incapable of scanning all the way to the margins, which causes a lot of trouble since you're scanning small receipts most of the time. Scanalizer software makes too many OCR mistakes, even with well-printed receipts in good condition. If you like the Scanalizer database, you're good, but interfacing with other applications is possible but cumbersome as a recurring practice. I could keep using it if it wasn't for the high error rate. I returned the product."
5,Great item - Easy to use,"A friend got one and recommended it to me. It scans my receipts, creates a folder, and exports them to a PDF file. It's small and scans a good image."
3,Great idea but......,"Excellent concept & scanner is easy to use and very portable. However, software recognition leaves something to be desired. Recognition of the vendor name is almost nonexistent especially if the name is in any way part of a logo. Something as simple as a Sam's Club receipt is not recognized. Large, page size receipts scan very poorly, and recognition of anything but clear, darkly imprinted receipts is weak or nonexistent. Additionally, creating nonstandard reports or modifying memorized lists is cumbersome. Sometimes ""you just can't get there from here"" A ""training"" or ""learning"" feature for logo's, graphics, or receipt formats would be very helpful. Overall however a useful, time saving, but not perfect, product which is probably worth the price paid."
2,Maybe I could have made it work...,"Unfortunatley I had to send it back.The problem is probably my computer but it took me over an hour to ""scanalize"" 3 receipts. After loading maybe 50 receipts the #'s weren't even all correct. The concept is cool and maybe if I gave it enough time I could work out the kinks but after days and days of scanalizing I just gave up."
3,scanner,"like the portability of the product (I have a laptop). Like the receipts scanner and report function, although I'm not sure I've figured it all out yet. Would like the card scanner function better if it integrated with my palm software."
5,Beautifully layered words,"This book is my introduction to Mr. Burroughs, but it definatly will not be the end. I have never read a book so detached yet so intriging, each paragraph takes you further from the ""real"" concrete world and closer to a world that is so complex and confusing. Rather than trying to make this a thesis or make this book into a lesson, Burroughs treats the subject as a observer and as an experience. It is a short book, you have nothing to lose. I highly recommend"
3,mindcandy for Beat freaks,"While I found many of the allusions interesting and anecdotes amusing, the book turns something like 5 years of dreams into short sequences and ended up seeming to me to be a sort of mindcandy for Beat freaks. I enjoyed the book, but then again, I've recently read a couple of his books and a book about his work and influence as a visual artist so more of the life references made sense. If you are a Beat poet fanatic, find yourself a cat and cuddle up for some nice distraction that's just enough to make you think but only if you feel like thinking"
5,An amazing book,"""My Education"" is one of the most interesting booksI've read in a while. Every page is stimulating, food forthought. It's definately a worthwhile read, and any Burroughs fan will love it.A great insight into the mind of Burroughs, go out and buy this book immediately, I can't reccommend it highly enough."
4,Good sunglasses,"They are more pinkish than purple but they are still a very prety shade. I was worried about them being too oversized for my face, but they are perfect. They come with a great case, bulky, but it will def ensure that I don't accidently smash them in my purse."
5,Excellent debut by Aussie author,"Heart's Passage is an excellent read by a promising new author. Swannell is Australian and it shows, with a skilfully drawn picture of the Great Barrier Reef and the women who fall in love there. I loved the realistic dialogue between the two main characters. There's also a lovely vein of humor through the piece and it's sexy. The author treads a fine line between erotica and romance, and manages to keep it on the tingly side of sensual ... A terrific read and I can't wait for the sequel."
5,Another great uber out of Australia,"Excellent first novel (and the sequel is even more accomplished with some lovely writing) set mostly at sea on a tour ship captained by a tall, dark woman with a deadly past which comes back to haunt her and threaten her growing relationship with an out lesbian US Republican (!) senator's partner, no less. Great humor, suspense, and pride of place, makes you want to visit downunder."
4,A biology major's dream . . .,"Eve, by Aurelio O'Brien, is a good book for people interested in biology.The story is a look into the future, when mankind has mastered biology, and uses his mastery to improve life on the planet earth. This interesting spin is a far cry from other futuristic stories that have mankind dominated by machines. However, there is a robot named Pentser that causes trouble throughout the book.I found Eve to be a nice escape from the world, and an entertaining novel. I'm interested to see what the movie will be like."
1,Terrible product,The orb drive is terrible. After owning it for 4 months the discsturned corrupt and ruined the drive. I sent it back (paying 20 bucks for shipping) and got a new one. 4 months later same thing. I sent it back again and 4 months later it is screwed up again. If you wanna buy a POS drive buy this. I will sell you mine and my 2 ruined discs...
4,The Lottery Bride,"Jeanette looks smashing in beautiful fur parkas when she heads north of the Arctic Circle in this 1930 musical/action/romance. Rudolf Friml is credited with the music and after loving ""The Firefly"", I looked forward to this musical set in Norway. However, the music lacks the Spanish flavor of ""The Firefly"". But we are treated to special effects when a large dirigible (think Hindenberg) crashes in the ice and the hero is on board. Both Jeanette in an ice breaker and the hero's brother with a dog team head out to rescue him, both simultaneously arrive just in time and we see Jeanette and her one and only embrace with a backdrop of Northern Lights in black & white. Well, it's different. And for fans of Jeanette, it's an early example of the sort of charm that kept her in the forefront of film musicals for many years to come. Collectors and fans of Jeanette will love it. It will seem dated to newcomers to her style of romantic musical film."
3,Good timing belt,My 2003 Focus was due for a tune up. So I did some extra changes including the timing belt change. When it was changed I noticed a thickness difference between this belt and the OEM part. The new Dayco belt seemed a bit thinner. I am not sure if it makes a difference and I hope it doesn't. Other than that I works well. My mechanic did recommend to get the Gates timing belt. I will try that one next.Now on the Amazon transaction was flawless as usual. No complaints here.
5,A wonderful book that stuck with me.,"I loved this book when I read it many years ago. The story was very engaging, and I loved the character interactions, especially Shawn's. This book was given to me when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, maybe earlier, and I thought being shipwrecked the way they were was such an adventure. It was also a very informative book in it's discussions of native fruits, pronounciations, and general life information. A great book for girls of all ages."
4,A movie well worth seeing again,"The first and only time I had seen this film was in the theater when I was 13. That is until I purchased it from Amazon. I remembered it as a GREAT movie when I was a kid and thought I'de give it another viewing. I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than I remembered. If anyone reading this has seen the film adaptation of the Stephen King novel ""Needfull Things"", you might want to check out this precurser. The film is beautifully shot and acted. Probably one of the best scenes in the film is the exchange between Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce in the library. It is wonderfully written and very compelling. This film would be a bit scary for younger children, but the older ones will get a kick out of it. The special effects for it's time are fantastic. I highly recommend this film to all fans of Science Fiction."
5,"Wicked and creepy ,it came my way","I saw this film when it was first released, and at that time i was managing a cinema in our town, and remember so vividly wondering if the censors had fallen asleep during their watching of this film, especially as they had given it a P.G cert which in effect made it an open market for the kids.Now i thought the film was supurb, but so sinister and creepy, in fact i recall being more un-nerved by it, than some of the then ' Horror ' films around. certainly i felt it was unsuitable for many under 12 year olds. However, for me the film has a strange enchantment even though i still feel it is so sinister, i am pleased to have added it to my film collection."
4,Evil Nightmares,"i had nightmares about this movie for years and years. i never realised what it was from, or even that i had ever seen this movie. i had a recurring dream about a certain evil carrousel... it wasn't until i was in high school and read the book by ray bradbury that i realised my evil merry-go-round dream was a part of literary history. i found out that the book had been made into a movie, and found the movie, only to see my age-old dream played out exactly as i'd remembered, with the lightning strikes and all. so perhaps i am biased, but this film is one of my favourites now."
4,Very good,One of my daughter's fave from when she was younger. Great movie to add to your DVD collection.
3,not as good as the book!,"I'd like to ask Ray Bradbury why he felt it necessary to change so much of the story for this film adaptation of his own book. As an average movie it stands alone, but if you have already read the book, don't expect the same level of suspense, mystery or atmosphere. The film has virtually none of these. I could understand the difference if the screenplay had been written by someone else, but the way Bradbury has cut up his own work is beyond understanding. The main let down is the ending. When I read the book I pictured it as a movie. It would have worked wonderfully without any major changes. This movie just lacks the magic of the original story."
3,Something Wicked This Way Comes,This is a good book that teaches ou that no matter what something looks like or how old you are no ones perfect. it teaches you to do the best with what you have and never try to change who you are. The book is a little hard to understand in the begining but after a while you get used to reading it and really get into the book! I think Almost everyone would enjoy this book. :)
3,"Nice music,poetic writing,but the kids were miscast.","This film has a beautiful style with great photography,great music and a poetic writing style(typical of Ray Bradbury)and the movie really lights up when Jason Robard's character confonts Johnathon Pryce's villian.But,unfortunately the children are hopelessly miscast and have no presence at all,therefore there is no reason to care about their characters.This spoils an otherwise good film.The ending was refilmed(ordered by interfering Disney executives)despite the director's objections and seems to clash with the rest of the films poetic style."
3,surprising,I was so impressed as a child that this is a favorite still. Disney took a chance and provided a surprising thriller.
4,"de javu, something creepy from my childhood .......","I've read several reviews on this film and I agree with the customers more than the critics. This has to be one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen by disney, until years later, I didn't even know it was by them. I was eight or nine the first time I saw it, my mom saw the title and was turned off by it, so I couldn't own it. The DVD is superbly recolorized, even the night time scenes make more sense, I'm not sure Anchor Bay could've cleaned it up this well, I'm glad I waited on this version, the only real downfall is the lack of special features-just a trailer, oh well. Jonathan Pryce is alot like Max VonSydow in Needful Things but obviously a lighter scale.Despite being by disney, I can't suggest this to anyone under the the age of at least twelve, parents really should watch this with/or before their kids do, that's just my opinion."
4,This movie is WICKED!,"I saw this movie when I was about eight years old, and I just remembering it being the coolest movie ever. Eight years later, and it still doesn't fail to thrill me. It's such a good story and the effects, though not that great, are still cool and mystical in their own way. The story's amazing, and I really don't know what to say about it, just that if anyone is hesitant about buying this movie, just buy it! Really, you won't be sorry at all."
4,something wicked this way comes,a rather scary movie from disney which is a good adaption of ray bradbury's novel i like this dvd version of the book allan g beck from wellington nz.
4,"FYI, if you are looking for the widescreen version...","This is not really a review, but if you are looking for the widescreen version of this film, it is also included on this DVD. That has NOT been noted in the description provided by Amazon. It really irks me when DVDs are issued in only full screen versions. I won't go into the particulars as to why. Those of us who are into this know why. This DVD has both 1.33:1 and 1.85:1 versions on a one-sided dual layered menu selectable format."
5,One of my childhood favorites,Every fall I have to watch this movie! It's one of my all time favorites. Ray Badbury's novel comes to life in this movie and maybe it's just nostalgia for me but I love this movie.
5,Fantastic!,This is a fantastic movie can't believe more people don't like it!Just love everything about it the acting and the atmosphere!
4,Something wicked this way comes,This disc arrived on a timely basis and in good condition as advertized - It meets regular standards for dvd recordings. Both audio and video resolution are of expected quality.
4,"I, on the other hand, loved this movie.","Not having read the Bradbury story on which this is based, I didn't compare the movie to the story. And, not being so technical a movie critic (such as the photography and casting), I didn't have any problem with the casting or cinematography. I just liked the movie as it is. OK, so maybe the bad guy is a hubba-hubba in my view, but it is the kids and Jason Robarts who make the movie.If you like this movie, you might try to find a copy of Lady in White, too. That is another little known terrific movie, also set in the past in a small town."
4,Spooky,"An erie movie from the 80's. Look close at Mr. Dark. Does he look familiar? I'll leave that one up to you to find out who he is, and what other movie he has been in. A great halloween spooker of a movie!"
5,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Start with the fact that it's a Ray Bradbury story done by Disney. Mingle a battle of good and evil with all the hopes and fears of humanity. Wrap this in fine settings and costumes. Top it off with the presence of Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce leading a very professional cast! The language is something that can tickle the ears: ""By the pricking of my thumbs; Something wicked this way comes!"" while the humor can be sly and comfortable. Yes, it's a family worthy film with something different for everyone. This is a find! A real gem! I highly recommend it."
4,Something Wicked this Way Comes,"Something Wicked This Way Comes is a must have VHS becase it is one of Ray Bradbury's best stories.This movie will have you wondering how it all happened. It's filled with action and it will frighten you. It also contains a few humurus scenes.This story is about two young boys that discover that there is something wicked about a carnival that come to town. The two boys are named Will and Jim. There is one ride in particular that the boys find interesting, which is the Carousel. The Carousel is really a time machine that Mr. Dark is trying to hide. Mr. Dark is the villain in this story. Once the boys find out that his body is made out of souls, he tries to kill them. Mr. Dark can also grant peoples temptations, but if you don't know how to use it it backfires. In the end both the witch and Mr. dark get killed by Will and his father."
4,Very Cool Book,"""Handmade Bags"" has some really great project ideas. It starts out with the basics - supplies, sewing for beginners, etc. and then moves on to the projects (which have whimsical names like ""Red, red rose"" and ""Gilded cage""). There are 30 professional looking project ideas - all with great illustrations and detailed instructions. Some of the projects use some interesting materials, however I was disappointed that there were a couple of ""knitting with wire"" bags - that's just not my thing.Although most of the patterns seem pretty straight forward, they are small grid illustrations - meaning you can't take the book to the copy machine and enlarge - you have to use traditional tailoring methods/measuring/etc. to scale up the pattern. For people who have never sewn, I would advise getting ""Making Handbags"" by the folks from FIT first and then use this book for additional creative ideas and techniques."
3,Poor purses,"This book is really well presented with amazing pictures and is easy to read. If you have any knowledge of sewing and any interest in making handbags that appear professional this is not the book for you, I think it should be reclassified as a craft book for kids. If you're an adult save your money."
5,Cool ideas!,"There are a lot of cool ideas in this book, along with 30 bag patterns for you to follow. In addition to traditional fabric handbags, here are several ""wire bag"" designs in this book.Written by professional accessory designers, this book is full of clever and innovative ideas. However, in spite of the creativity, I did not find many bags I would actually make.However, it is well written with many good sewing tips. It even includes a fully illustrated section on hand-sewing which I found very useful.If nothing else, this is a good ""idea book""."
2,Rediculous looking things,"Most of the purses in this book were so foolish looking I wouldn't use them if someone gave them to me, much less waste my time to make them. I was looking for bags to make and sell but I have found better ideas for free on the internet. To this books credit, it does give good instruction on construction basics such as pockets and linings."
2,It's Not My Bag....,"You can tell a woman by her handbag: if you are all about building a professional persona, these handbags will break your look. To me, these handbags look haute-crafty rather than haute couture, and some of these handbags resemble Easter baskets."
3,Not bad...,"Not something I want to watch over and over, and the acting and plot could've been better. But you know, the idea of it wasn't too bad. A little more time working onn it and it could've been a hit. Came in good shape."
1,sorry it had no suspense. it just meandered.,"this book accomplished things, but there was no tension. it seemed as if the author couldnt be serious the whole time the book was written. i really hope the next books are better, this is the first book ive read from irene. ive read a lot of books and i have no idea how this got more than one star"
1,Not worth the time it takes to read,"Simply another rehashed, run-of-the-mill ""story"" that feels thrown together. Every ""bad guy"" is a delusional psychopath with almost identical traits. The entire story lacks drama -- key plot developments fail to develop, with changes foreshadowed, established, and reviewed all on the same page, and then forgotten."
2,"It's 8x10""","I ordered this item (11x17"" portrait) and was shipped an 8x10"" color print on thin, non-photographic, poster paper. The image is okay, except it's cropped oddly: Pippi and monkey appear at the bottom, below a weirdly large area of blurry snow, etc. I ended up cutting the print to frame it horizontally as a 5x7"". Definitely not what I had in mind, but for the price I wasn't too surprised. I'm sure this isn't an item in high demand. My wife, the Pippi fan, was delighted to get it."
3,"hard to read-dretmar,nampa,idaho","This watch is very hard to read because of the lines on its face,I ended up giving it away. It is a Fossil though, so it is a pretty good quality for the money."
4,Shrek the 3rd,"Shrek the Third isn't my pick for the best of the 3 Shrek movies, but it is still well worth buying. The characters are rich and colorful and there are plenty of laughs to be had. A great stocking stuffer for young and old alike."
2,Shrek needs a redo,"Hi All,I've been a fan of Shrek from the beginning and own all three. I hope they stop with this one. It is clearly an attempt to produce money not quality. Worth a Netflix rental but not a purchase.Amazon did their job...wish others had."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this movie would be about the babies, instead it wasn;t till the end of the movie that the babies were shown.. My three-year-old granddaughter got bored with it pretty quick. I think that Shrek four will be better, if they include the babies more and remember the movie is suppose to be for kids."
3,A bit boring but.......,"watched this movie. For this movie, it isn't what I excepted to be. It is funny, but only in a couple of scenes. Other scenes are boring. Unfortunately, not all scenes are funny. Therefore, the story is not a very good one. For the acting and the direction, they are fine. For the visuals, they are okay. Overall, I am kind of disappointed to see this movie is not as good as other series of Shrek. However, it is still fine but a lot of scenes make me bored."
4,Good Watch,Another film in the Shrek movie line. This one just doesnt live up to the first but is still alot better than other movies out there today. It returns all of the actors who supply the main voices which again is great. It just seemed to be a lot of the same jokes redone again for a third time.
1,"This is a joke, right?","This is by far the worst animated movie I have ever seen. The plot is terrible, and it isn't even remotely funny. I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD."
2,Disappointing,Very rarely the spin-offs can hold on to the quality of the first one. Shrek 2 did exactly that. Shrek 3 does not. I think they have already made a movie too many in the series. I wonder if they are bereft of new ideas at Dreamworks and so want to keep spinning money out of spin-offs. May be they can make a tv series instead as Disney does with almost every successful movie.
2,The third and I hope the last,Shrek the turd should be flushed. Eddie Murphy is brilliant but even his Donkey is getting old. What happened to the frog King. He croaked. Punsters all across America were waiting for that line.
5,Third times the charm...in HD-DVD,"As someone who was only mildly amused by the first film and alarmed that something so annoying was morphing into a perpetual series, i can say this is easily the best of all the Shrek movies. Clever, funny and with a familiar but balanced character lineup that is prevented from going too far over the top as happened last go around. The HD-DVD version i watched is particularly worth noting as the detail and clarity evident adds an entirely new dimension to watching an animated film."
4,Had to Have,"I wanted all of the series. Thought the first one was the best, but this one had some really funny parts."
3,Hubby Loves Shrek,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband because he loves Shrek and Donkey. He really enjoyed the movie.
3,Come on its not That bad,I give this one three stars But Shrek and Shrek 2 Are Better But this is Second to none I dont care what these reviws say I like this movie .
3,Shreck 3,"Anti-climatic - but maybe a must own because it's part of the series. The suprise to me was that as good as the original release was [Shreck 1] - that Shreck 2 is the best one in the series. Shreck 2 is truly ingenious, funny, bold and dynamic in its entirety.You may want to own this as part of the series - but definately don't miss Shreck 2."
1,retarded,this is so boring it's sick...I downloaded it for free and I still don't think it's worth a watch. This is an insult to young kids...and everybody else in it's target audience. Hopefully dream works doesn't think the general public is this stupid....please spare us all!!!
1,Worst of the Shrek Movies,This was the worst of the Shrek movies. It wasn't funny or entertaining. I wish I didn't waste my time and money on it in the theater. If you still really want to see this movie rent it before you buy so you wont be disappointed. I'm sure the PQ is real good on the HD-DVD version but that doesn't make up for a poor quality movie.
5,Love Blu-Ray,"Just watching the background, how clear it is; truly amazing. The movie is good - the clarity makes it even better. With blu-ray, I was noticing things I never did before - like the weave of Shek's shirt. The 4-o'clock shadow. And much more. I doubted the hype about blu-ray, but WOW - it's true."
1,NOT in Arabic!,"This is probably not applicable for most, but I specifically bought this movie because Arabic was one of the listed languages in which it was dubbed. However, I think they meant to say Spanish (they're very similar words, Arabic and Spanish...) because in reality the only options are English, French, and Spanish. Otherwise the movie is just fine. The one-star rating is simply because it is not the product that is advertised, and for me that made all the difference."
1,Unable to give title as we cannot view DVD?,"We live in Spain (Region 2) as this DVD is region 1 we are unable to view the product. Purchasing DVD's over the internet becomes risky and difficult if the particulars on screen do not indicate clearly its region which sometimes happens. Therefore I have a product I cannot enjoy unless I go to the expense of purchasing an all region DVD player, which is not that easy in Spain. I should have been wary when the item in question was being advertised in dollars. There is no indication on the DVD that I can see which indicates the Region. Any suggestions?"
1,I walked out on it....,The original Shrek was great and Shrek 2 was good as sequels go. Shrek the Third was a wreck from the beginning. I got the feeling that most of the people involved in the movie just did not care and were on there to do their jobs because there was a multi movie deal in place. If you are not between the ages of about 5 to 8 this movie will cause some pain and suffering. I walked out on this movie after about 40 minutes. The sad part about that is that I was watching it in my living room. The DVD played on with no one in the room.
1,Worst one of the trilogy,"As someone very special pointed out, the Shrek movies are all about pop culture references, and spotting the celebrity voices, rather than watching it properly for a movie.I'm sure if I re-watched the first two movies, I would be ultimately as fed up of them as I am this one. They were good when they first come out, but the third was one too far I think.There's just nothing stand out about the movie. It's the same tired jokes, the same nonsense once again, and it's just got really old.Is it worthwhile seeing? No, it's not, only if you seriously LOVED the first two, but otherwise, put it down and walk away."
1,Shrek The Agenda Driven,"I'm a huge fan of Shrek and was really looking forward to the 3rd in the series. After watching it I only have one tiny little question:What were they thinking?The characters, new and old, could have mailed in their performance from planet Zarquan, and the plot line, when there WAS one, was little more than a platform for political finger wagging! This Shrek might as well have been written by Michael Moore!And I'm thinkin Walt Disney wouldn't have been too thrilled to see Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White hanging out with a drag queen, regardless of how PC the concept. Not quite the Disney image he spent his life creating.For you who do enjoy adult political and social commentary disguised as childrens' entertainment, my copy of Shrek the Third is for sale for 2 cents, and IMO, it's still overpriced."
3,"Ok, hopefully the last one, starting to get old","I enjoyed Shrek 2, Shrek was good, but now the third is just an extension on the franchise. I think this one should be it. Mostly adult like humor, toned down a notch from the second movie. Just not suprising. Credit on the story line though, nice to draw on the king arthur story. Worth it to buy for the collection, but not a must have."
3,So-so Shrek,"Sometimes sequels are good (Spiderman III), othertimes not-so-good (X-Men III). Regretfully, Shrek the Third is one of those not-so-good sequels.The movies tries to live up to the quality of the first two and does score some points. Unfortuantely, it suffers from a bad case of ""been there done that"". You can the feeling a lot of what you see has been borrowed from the previous movies, the end result being a picture best viewed on the DVD, Comcast, or cable.Can't win 'em all, Shrek."
1,it sucks so bad,It was one of the worst movies of the year it sucked so bad that I really didn't want to finish it but I did.
3,Not as good as,the first and second one but still worth the hour and a half. Good for the whole family.
5,hahahaha,"Like the other 2 in the series, this Shrek is laugh-out-loud hilarious. Unlike most sequels, Shrek the Third loses none of the hilarity of the original, or even the second."
3,Nothing special,"Though there are a few funny jokes, Shrek 3 just feels long and flat. One can't escape the feeling that we've been here before. It literally is a paint by numbers production designed just to bring in the bucks. I certainly hope that the series end here. It's not a bad movie per se, but it certainly not a good one either."
4,just plain fun,the jolly green giant and his crew were fun to watch. no deep or dire thoughts for a change. fairy tales are good.
1,Christmas Gift for Family,This item was on a family members gift wish list. So I cannot give you a correct review as you ask without viewing the gift first.
1,Shocking disappointment,"I saw this movie for the first time on DVD. I've seen the first two. The movie was boring and totally lacking the sly wit that was part of the first two. It won't hold your attention. Don't buy this. If you have to see it out of curiosity, rent it. It's not even worth buying to complete the set."
2,Shrek 3 - Lost in translation,Not even close to the first two. Was looking for the humor. Fell short of my expectations. RENT IT FIRST BEFORE BUYING!
4,Should of released the first two in a box set..,"Although I will definately get this, I wish Dreamworks would of released it as a box set of HD DVDs with the first two Shrek movies included--or even separately. I think the box set would attract more moviegoers and fans of the show."
3,Could Have Been Better!!!,"When Shrek the 3rd came out, I was excited. Of the three May sequels, I was most excited for Shrek the 3rd. It could never ever beat the first two sequels! It was funny, but no whole scene was funny like the first two. There is no full scene with Donkey or Puss. I did not like it that much that the other fairy-tale princesses were pretty main. And the ogre babies are hideious (well, for Shrek and Fiona, they were cute). In all, it was pretty good."
5,Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition),"Shrek The Third is a very cute movie,I love this movie and I really enjoy all the Shrek Movies. They're very awesome and splendid to have in your DVD collection,Shrek The Third is about Shrek becoming King after his father-in law passes away and Shrek is next in line to be king but there is another heir Arthur Pendragon who he goes on a journey to find with donkey and puss in boots.Fiona his wife is expecting a baby and she doesn't tell Shrek until the start of his journey leave but Shrek can't hear her however Prince Charming and the other Fairytale villians try to take over Far Far Away but at the end Shrek stops Charming and defeats him.Arthur is King and Shrek and Fiona have children,this is a great movie for anyone and it's really fun."
4,Baby Liked It,"She prefers Shrek and Shrek 2, but she likes the Third and Forever After okay, just not as much as the first 2. No idea why, since she's 17 months old and can't really follow the story, but she is always enthralled when watching the first 2."
3,"Cute, but not as good as the original","Puss and donkey are fun, but this story runs out of gas long before the end. The death of the frog king is fun. I you do not want to spoil the good feeling you had from the first Shrek movie, don't watch this one."
3,Not great,Its not as good as one or two but not as horrible as the last. thats all i can say about that
3,Shrek the Third not so funny,"First Shrek was great, second was even better, third was a disappointment. It was enjoyable, but I belly laughed ONLY once and not for too long. I hope they'll end it here."
2,not as good as the others,"the product was good the movie sucked compared to the first to. The jokes were not as funny, the plot line was weak."
2,Typical sequel,"This had its funny moments, but overall, it was disappointing. Of course we had to have the video to round out our collection and we'll probably watch it many times. Sequels are very rarely as good as the original."
1,Shrek the Worst,"Shrek 3 is a sad, empty chapter in the Shrek saga. The jokes are flat, the pop culture references are forced, and the big play finale made me squirm in agony. The first movie was brilliant but this one shows that writers are running on empty. Graphically it's a beautiful movie but the movie seems forced to make as much money as possible. The writers clearly needed another year or two to develop the story. Ratatoui and Surf's Up were vastly superior to this movie. Even my daughter hated this movie."
1,If you say so,"I didn't think this was nearly as entertaining as the first two films. Plus, I didn't think it was appropriate to attempt to insert a gay theme into a children's film. Cinderella's ugly step-sisters were clearly just dudes in dresses. Nice."
1,So disappointing,"I loved the first two. Excellent and fun films. Part three was such a sad let down. I compare it to my friends have kids. In the film, Shrek has kids and the film was boring. My friends who have kids, are also boring. Now, for those of you who have kids and think I just don't know the true joy of life having one, I don't care. And stop letting your children run, screaming and playing around restaurants, stores and and other places where restraint is polite."
2,Lesser quality production,I was very disappointed in number III. I and II were very good but III was crude and reminded me of slash/bang TV that so many TV shows have become today. It left me feeling sad after the film. Why are our standards dropping so fast in America?
4,great movie,"it was a funny movie that the whole family will injoy! it has funny things in it, but little kids might not get them!!! go see it!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Shrek 3,Definately adult oriented more than the other 2. OK as far as 3rd movies in a series goes. NEED to STOP at this one.
5,Was a gift... my niece loved it!,"My niece couldn't have been more excited about receiving this movie for Christmas. Of course she had seen it multiple times before, but now she owns it and will see it multiple times again!"
1,unhappy,I am very unhappy with the movie as I purchased it for a small child and I do not like the content at all. I would not recommend it even for older children.
3,No longer laugh-out-loud funny.,"The ""ogre"" jokes aren't funny anymore -- Eddie Murphy is phoning his performance in and isn't even trying to be on-the-edge."
1,"Character looks like Shrek, doesn't act like Shrek",You know the writers are running out of ideas when the main characters become parents. Shrek 3-D and Shrek the Halls are much better and truer to the spirit of the series.
1,"VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTING","I loved the original Shrek. The first sequel was very poorly done. But, this last one was absolutely horrible. I couldn't even finish watching it. Absolutely NO imagination in the plot. BORING. Not funny. Sequels have a reputation for being poor, but this one sets new standards for bad sequels."
1,He's Lost it,"I saw this movie this past summer on an airplane on the way home to Chicago, I was comming back from Canada. there were a few funny moments in the film such as the high school refrences, but now the sherk series has worn out it's welcome."
1,Color me disappointed,"Just got the DVD in the mail. Opened the case, put in the movie, and it won't even play. For almost $6 plus S&H, I would have expected it to at least work. Ordering through amazon, I've never been disappointed until now."
1,Better Check your eyes- Steve Stew!,"I dont know what kind of critic Steve is, but this movie was bad. I saw this when it came out because the second Shrek was hilarious. Me and my friend saw it during the day and we both fell asleep 3 times! It was like they put this together just to have a third movie. This movie was no where near as funny as the 2nd Shrek, In other words-""Don't believe the hype"", trust me."
2,Blek,"This one just seems uninspired - the storyline and especially most of the jokes. It's easy to see where they ""expect"" you to laugh and seeing most of the funny parts in the previews many times, how can we laugh again? The storyline could have been a bit deeper. This one, again, had great visuals as the other Shreks. It just seems to be lacking the ""magic"" of the first one."
3,More like 2.5 stars,"Shrek 3 was pretty decent, but at times it was also pretty stupid. I LOVED the second one and had high hopes for this one. There were a few mildly funny bits but overall, I would say it was just OK. I would probably watch it again if it was ever on TV, I dont know about purchacing it though..."
2,Just a flop,"Where are my best hopes? In the dust. Where are my not the best hopes? Same hole, alas. All I'd seen on the screen were dull and unimaginative resrikes of the old discoveries. And two or three attempts of the new ones - weak attempts really... But where is the good old fun? Gone whith a puke.Just for my curiosity: why the Shrek's ship sailed with only one crazy skipper aboard and withowt any additional crew? And why that skipper disappeared completely from the screenplay and from the ship then? Seems it did not puzzle Shrek or his bysiders, anyway...I was disappointed, DreamWorks pals and gals. You did not do your homework well enough. In fact, two stars are better reward than you deserved. Just remember you previous masterpieces. What a shame."
4,3 1/2 Stars,"I know a lot of people were disappointed with this film, but it really isn't a bad picture, I just think that it pales when compared to the first two. The idea is interesting enough one--the frog king dies leaving Shrek next in line to be king unless he can find a distant cousin to the king named Arthur. The Arthurian myths are only barely touched despite the presence of Arthur and Merlin. I think they dropped the ball with that one. I laughed at a few scenes with the Gingerbread Man, but overall this one lacked the charm of the other films. Maybe the characters are getting stale, or maybe the writing wasn't up to snuff. I will probably buy this one to go with the first two, but on its' own it is a toss up."
2,"""Ogregious"" errors!","Short and sweet here:the adventure was good, the comedy was dreadful.What Made SHREK 1 and 2 better was clever dialogue. That IS NOT here in SHREK THE THIRD. The comedy and script now seem cheap and lame.As an adult with no kids,IMO, this was the worst SHREK yet. I waited until I could see this at a ""second run"" cinema for $3. I am glad that was all I spent.Kids may like this one, but as an adult....ZILCH! If there is a SHREK 4, the writers better get on the stick!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A middling sequel that offers little of the adventure and humor of the previous two installments, Shrek 3 feels perfunctory and unsatisfying; there's no real reason to see this movie, so spend your time and money elsewhere."
2,Just keeps gets worse.,"Just like most movies series they can not keep the plot or story going. If each release to this series it just keeps getting worse. Shrek one is excellent and a classic, Sherk two is so so and Sherk three leave it at the store or rent it."
4,Good family fun,This was a fun video for the family. Also purchased for a gift. Very good price. Pleased with purchase.
5,Shrek Fans,"If you enjoyed the first and second Shrek, then you will like this one as well. It is just as funny as the first two, if not funnier."
2,Shrek the Third,"Shrek One was the best of the three. Shrek the Third did not measure up to the first or the second one. Still, it was enjoyable in parts."
4,"Typically refreshing, good Shrek movie","A little darker than the first 2 movies, but still a great toon. My toddler loves it, and I do, too."
4,pretty good had to wait till the end to see the children,was ok but the hype was the kids and they didn't show till the very end
2,Shrek the Third,Much of the humor is recycled from the first two movies. A disapointment after the success of its predicessors. The kids even got bored with the repatition.
2,Disappointed,"My husband and I loved the first two Shrek movies, and, while it seemed that Shrek the Third had a lot of potential with the whole Arthur theme, it was ultimately disappointing and unfunny."
4,"Good, stuggle on the story line though","Continuing on the Shrek franchise, this one looks at Shrek not wanting to be king of Far Far Away after Feona's father dies, so he seeks to find another heir to the throne. In the midst of that Prince Charming decides to take over Far Far Away. A bunch of sub stories with Merlin and Author, and some fun scene, just not up to Shrek 1 or Shrek 2 standards. Good to watch and because it is a series, good to own."
5,Brilliant Shrek,"Shrek the Third (Widescreen Edition)Absolutely brilliant of course... Nothing will beat the first one, but they are all great..."
4,Still has the magic,"While not as stellar as Shrek 1 and 2, 3 is still certainly funny and cute (and beats Pirates 3)! I loved seeing all the little ogrelings."
1,Disappointed,"Shrek 3 is a dark, twisted movie not suitable for small children. It is violent at times and dwells in the subject of death and evil way too much to be a good movie. I was very disappointed, considering what great movies the 1st and 2nd ones were. I am so glad we screened this one before allowing the kids to see it."
3,Shrek 3,Still funny at #3 but not as developed as previous installments. Hoping #4 will be as good as #1 & 2.
2,not as fun this time,"As the saying goes, 3 times a charm, doesn't pertain to this film at all. The timing and feel of Shrek 3 is at the very best dim and tired. The spark that Shrek 1 posessed has long since faded. Rent this one, don't bother buying unless you are like me and just have to have all sets in my collection."
1,Boring!,"This Shrek is NOTHING like the first two. The first two were very original and funny. This Shrek has absolutely no plot, and is a complete bore!!"
1,unwatchably poor,"Hidious. Has none of the redeeming qualities of the 1st 2 Shreks. Very poor writing, very poor story line. A total ripoff, as I yanked it out of the player after 20 minutes of torture. It's very lowbrow. Avoid!"
1,Don't bother,"I rented this (thankfully) and I really want my 88 minutes back. I don't know why they bothered. It was not funny at all, boring and the plot was plain horrible. I think there's a new trend in movies. The 1st is great, the 2nd is fantastic and the 3rd is complete garbage. Please do not waste your money purchasing this. If you havent seen it yet, rent it before you decide."
1,Shrek the Third is horrible,"Shrek 1 was good and Shrek 2 was so-so, but Shrek the Third . . . It's absolutely awful. I wish Dreamworks understood that while they make money from crud like this, we parents have to suffer the criticism of their target audience: our children. And after watching this thing and listening to my 6-year-old say ""Daddy, I don't like it"" a hundred times, I can't say that I'm horribly interested in seeing another Dreamworks movie."
2,Very disappointed!,"I couldn't wait to see it when it came out on DVD. But I was soo disappointed, it wasn't funny or as good as the first one! It was actually boring (they should of just stopped on the first one, because the second one wasn't worth it either)."
3,this one is only for the kids,"Lacking the originality and the freshness of its two predecessors, Shrek The Third manages a few laughs. Mostly, the jokes are flat and childish. Shrek movies have become known for making fun and delighting their audience with an incredible movie soundtrack, yet, the third installment attempts to be mediocre and gather the attention of little kids (presumably in hopes of staying afloat long enough to earn the big bucks). The Ogre himself has less face movements (with his jaw moving but the rest of the face remaining expressionless) and Fiona is barely in the movie to make much of an impact.The credits, however, are done incredibly well and are enjoyable to watch. If only the rest of the movie was as entertaining."
1,How Unabashedly Awful,"Okay. I went into this knowing and loving the first wo, but knowing close to nothing about Shrek the Third. So, I only had expectations to laugh.Never happened.It just isn't funny.Not only that, but Shrek develops responsibility issues. What?He doesn't want to be a father? He's nervous about it? He's a ogre for goodness sakes, the last thing i want in an ogre is ""Daddy issues"".Not only that, but Shrek is due to inherit the throne of Far, Far Away.He doesn't want to do that either. Instead, he goes on a voyage to find King Arthur (WHAT?) who is Fiona's cousin and thus, inherit the throne for him.Lame.Words cannot describe how lame this actually was.Don't buy it if you haven't seen it.If you must, rent."
2,Maximum audience age is 10,"Shrek 1 and 2 was funny, entertaining, and enjoyable. Really looked forward to the third installment. After reading many negative reviews, thought they must of been biased, still went ahead and watched it.Sorry to say, all the negative reviews were right on target. The movie is completely retarded. It's suppose to be a family oriented / grown up cartoon. After watching Shrek 3, it made my IQ down quite a bit. With how mature the kids are today, even 10 yr olds would see this movie as being dumb.I would still recommend this movie to kids 0 - 10 because the sound track is decent. But to let older kids watch this would simply degrade their intelligence level. For grown ups to watch this is simply insulting to our mind."
2,only donkey and puss in boots make movie worthwhile,"if at all.Shrek 3 is bad. for little kids, it's okay, but for adult watching the film, it's bad. Shrek the original was awesome all around.it appealed to young and old.2 was just as good. it appealed all round and Puss in Boots was awesome.but part 3 is bad. like what Jaws 3 was to the Jaws Franchise. horrible.there is a story line, bad, but there is one. i don't understand the point in having Justin Timberlake in this film, as he does nothing special like Banderas did in Shrek 2.overall, Shrek 3 felt rushed, like if they made the movie because they knew they would profit only. there is no heart in this movie, none whatsoever, which is sad because of Shrek 1 and 2."
1,How could you betray us Shrek?!?!,"Hi well to start when we herd this was in the theaters we went and saw it the opening day. However we left disappointed. This is a sad follow up to the first two movies. The comedy is boring and not an ounce of it is funny and the plot oh! Don't even get me started on that!! It's so lame simple and boring ""find arthur so Shrek doesn't have to be king."" I mean it's so boring! The movie would probably be a whole lot better if it didn't have such a lame plot. We can think of a trillion things better than what they went with. Well overall this is a boring wannabe follow up to the first movies. Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."
5,"Great Film, Even more amazing HD DVD!","Since Amazon has not listed the features, I am offering them here:Disc Features:* Featurettes: ""Meet the Cast,"" ""The Fauxly Grail,"" ""Hot Lunch,"" ""Cyrano De Artie,"" ""Doppelgangers,"" ""Tech of Shrek,"" ""Donkey Dance,"" ""Big Green Goofs,"" ""Shrek's Guide to Parenthood,"" ""Merlin's Magic Crystal Ball,"" ""Learn the Donkey Dance,"" ""How to Be Green""* Lost Scenes* Theatrical Trailers: 'Bee Movie,' 'Kung Fu Panda'HD Exclusive Content:* Picture-in-Picture: ""The Animators' Corner"" experience featuring storyboards, deleted scene pitches and technical goofs* Dreamworks Animation Video Jukebox* ""My Menu"" customizable character menu skins* Web Enabled Features: Shrek's Trivia Track (available on street date), The World of Shrek, Donkey's Digital Coloring Book"
3,Shrek the Third,"King Harold (Cleese) is dying, and names Shrek (Myers) as his heir. Shrek wants none of that, and sets out to find Arthur (Timberlake). Aided by Donkey (Murphy) and Puss `n Boots (Banderas), he finds Arthur only to discover he is a bit of a loser. Meanwhile, back in Far Far Away, Prince Charming (Evert) stages a coup, imprisioning Fiona (Diaz), Queen Lillian (Andrews), Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and others. Shrek has his work cut out for him.""Shrek the Third"" is move of the same. There is nothing remotely new about this installment of the franchise. It exists only to make money, and will make a lot of it. But, the story feels tired this time around. Sure, it is good to see the familiar characters once again, but they give us nothing new. Adults may be bored, but children will probably love it (my nephew did). I really cannot recommend this film though."
3,still ok...,"Despite the low reviews/ratings of Shrek 3, it is still worthy of watching. Just don't expect it to be just as good as parts 1 and 2. The thing about Shrek 3 is that it is funny but the storyline sucked.Shrek's father-in-law, King Harold, dies. But before he dies, he tells Shrek that he is next in line to be king. Not wanting to be king, Shrek asks who is next after him, he learns that Arthur is next. So, Shrek takes off on a sea voyage to locate this Arthur.Meanwhile, Charming schemes his revenge on Far Far Away kingdom. With the help of storybook villians, he captures the queen and princesses. He has plans to destroy Shrek, so he can be king.On the other hand, Fiona announces that she's pregnant. Shrek doesn't think that an ogre can be a good father. He contemplates whether he'll be good enough or not.All I can say is that I did enjoy this movie...with their hilarious lines. Of course, most of their jokes were geared towards adults. Now, the storyline...that's another story."
2,surprised,"I was surprised. I knew it wasn't going to as good as the first two, but this was horrible. This was no where near as funny as the first, and does not even as near as good as the second. The first 15 minutes were good but the rest, crap. I was glad that this movie was short."
1,Waste!,"Im sorry, this movie sucked. Shrek 2 was way better, this movie(Shrek 3) they just threw together. Me and my friend fell asleep watching it. Trust me, rent it first."
4,Third Time Is The Charm,"This movie incorporates each of the main characters from Shrek and Shrek II with humor and integrity to the characters. The HD effects are amazing and add to the viewing pleasure. Rarely do sequels do justice to the original movie, but this one is a must see for both adults and children alike who enjoyed the cast of characters in the previous Shrek movies. The movie arrived promptly, in new and perfect condition, and is a great value. We will definitely order movies from Amazon again."
4,good movie,"I love animated movies, I like this one, but not as much as I liked the first and the second movies from Shrek."
1,Stick with the first,"Nothing like the first Shrek. Boring and lame made fall sleep while I was watching. I'm someone who laughs in all movies, but Shrek third was incapable of steal a laugh from me. If you don't want to get disappointed, stick with the first, because neither the second or the third is worth your time."
1,The worst Dreamworks animated movie,"Dreamworks is not a company known by its great plots in 3D animation, but this time they forgot something that Pixar has as the first important thing in a movie: a great plot.The story is unsustainable, the main character becomes lost in his own characteristics, the situations has no justification and becomes a bunch of scenes without continuity and nonsense.The princess are capable to destroy stone walls with his head, but are not capable to defeat the castle guards (just as an example).Avoid purchasing this movie in any format available, this not worth the money you can spend on it, is not good even for rent. Only watch it if someone lend it to you and also you want to throw away your precious time."
3,"If you can't get enough of Shrek...., Rent (don't buy) this DVD","You may love the jolly green ogre, and his band of merry donkeys, cats, puppets, gingerbread men, etc.However what was once fresh, new and innovative, now is bit like day old bread, still edible, but more than a bit stale.My family and I really wanted to like this movie. We rented it and Ratatouille the same weekend, and guess which was the more memorable of the non-human characters?The problem is, you get a sense this film was written by a committee of corporate types who rather than deciding to tell a good story, decided to show the world how clever they are. You never connect with this film, as it is gag, after gag, like a bad vaudeville sketch.In Shrek I and Shrek II you cared about what happened to the characters, this time...., I couldn't care less.Cheers!"
1,"Waste of money, Cheap and tacky",This book is a joke. It is poorly written and it looks like it was made at someone's kitchen table. It is only four sheets of paper with a card stock cover and the page layout is very juvenile. The information is generic and one third of each page is blank. If you buy this book then you get what you deserve. This product shouldn't even be considered a real book.
3,Not Enough Depth,"I was disappointed in ""Astrology and Aptitude"". I felt the author didn't go into enough depth with topics such as fixed stars, asteroids, arabic points, etc. It would have been nice to see how these components fit into the chart regarding one's career. Instead she just did a basic overview of each and moved on. Even her chart examples were lacking in detail.If you are just starting out in astrology, this will be a good book for you, for it covers the signs and planets in regard to one's career very well.However, if like me you have gone beyond basic understanding of astrology and want something more, you will be disappointed."
2,Boring ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,It was very dissapointing for a margeret Weis book Its not a book u wanna read. Some people might though
3,"Some useful stuff, but also ommissions","This book is what it claims to be. No more, no less.It has a lot of new equipment for PC's and some handy rules for the use of it. The most useful part of the book and the only part that really differs from the Players handbook and the DMG is the vehicle rules and stats which I had felt was lacking greatly in the original core books.Unfortunately in the charts for weapons, items, magic items etc, this book does not include any of the stuff from the Players Handbook or the DMG which means you either have to make your own lists or refer to both books if you want the basic stats for any items. This is a small niggle but, it is always nice to know which chart to refer to when you need to know something.It is a good sourcebook, but if you are wanting anything that is particularly new or exciting then it is not worth the cover price. This book is more an expansion on the old stuff than anything new."
3,"So-So, more helpful for DMs","Like others, I was expecting a lot more out of this book. It described only a small handful of new types of equipment, hardly glossed over new potions/poisons, and was mostly descriptors of specific magic items. Aesthetics-wise, the illustrations were kind of sub-par and the guide was in black and white. It's not a big deal, but the color in the other books added a lot of character this book lacks. It's sort of an insult to injury.What it did give was a nice handful of new exotic weapons and a handy pricing guide for a DM. If your campaign involves a lot of movement by ship or caravan, there's info on that, and if you have a small group that often hires minions, there's a huge pricing table on NPCs you can hire (everything from healers to jewelers to bodyguards).If you're in a group, it might be worth it for one person to have the book, especially if you're in a campaign where exotic weapons would be a good spice."
2,Fuzzy Use,"I bought the 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because of the new armor, adventuring gear, clothing table, food and drink prices table, poison table, vehicles, and creatures (mounts, pets, etc). I did not buy 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because I was expecting a miracle.Good thing, too, because the book didn't provide much more than I wanted. Yes, there are hundreds of new weapons and other random things, but everything blurs together in one run-on list. I'm not that fond of the magic weapons list, but the things I did want were there, thus I bought the book.If you're looking for random information to throw at your DM or include in the game, this can be a helpful book. Don't buy it if you're looking for an awesome addition to your equipment and arms collection, because it probably won't help you much."
2,Not so much Arms and Equipment as ...,"The Short of it boils down to the one line, ""you don't need a book that lists every single weapon avaliable. "" And I'll agree with that. No book should list every single piece of equipment as only a sourcebook about arms and equipment should carry that sort of information, rather I would prefer to see a bunch of poorly thought out rules and reprints from dragon magazine bound and hardcovered.Why anyone would want a book full of arms and equipment is beyond me, I for one LOVE reading through 12 different books trying to find a specific piece of equipment. I personally think this book is SO MUCH BETTER than the 2nd edition AoE guidebook, which was burdened down with pages and pages of descriptions of weapons, armor, equivilencies and rules for their use. They had a hirelings section, it was great because that is certainly what I bought an arms and equipment book for, hiring people.Perhaps I could hire a few writers to actually write what the title says."
4,"Nice bag, but still really only a bag.","This bag works perfectly for a couple of my bigger lights I use when I DJ. There is not one thing I can say bad about this bag. Nice wide zipped top to make it easy to put the bigger lights in and out. I zipped pocket to put an extra cable or something else. And a nice handle. But like I said it is still just a bag, yes it's a padded bag and very very nice, but I am just not sure why it has to cost so much money. But like they say if you want the best you have to be willing to pay for the best. It is worth the money considering there really isn't anything out there like it."
3,its a cd sleeve...,its a cd sleeve. it's made of white paper. it's kind of clear in the middle.... it holds cds. so if you have cd's you want to put in cd sleeves ...
3,Ok card reader,"Card reader works, if you can get the Xd card in the slot. You can not just luck up and slide it in. You have to work and work and eventually it will go into the slot. Sometimes you feel like giving up and then it will go into the slot and it fits just fine. When it goes in everything works well."
2,Wrong Model,"I live in Trinidad which uses the Latain Americian Feed, so the receiver should be a L12 not D12... No reply yet from the supplier. i purchased from"
4,Direct TV Receiver,Im using this receiver in a spare room on an old TV. Easy to install. I have a great picture too.
5,Enjoyed the CD & loved the DVD,"... just listened to the new Strunz & Farah CD (Rio De Colores)and loved it! Two thumbs up! A friend turned me on to Strunz & Farah when their previous album was released and I've been a fan eversince. The only thing I haven't been able to do yet is to see them perform live. But, surprise: They have a DVD of some of their concerts that is the ""next best thing"" than being there. I recommend ""Strunz and Farah in Performance,"" their new DVD, to all the fans who have never had a chance to see them live. While I'm waiting for them to perform in Boston next month, I'll keep ""Rio De Colores"" in my CD player in the car!!!!"
2,"IT'S OK, BUT NOT GREAT.","FOR ME IS ALWAYS A NEW ADVENTURE WHEN A NEW STRUNZ AND FARAH RECORD IS RELEASED BUT THEIR LAST ONES ARE ONLY A SERIES OF REPETITIONS AND I ALWAYS GO BACK TO MY 2 FAVORITE ALBUMS, GUITARRAS AND FRONTERA. THE IDEAS OF JORGE STRUNZ COMPOSITIONS ARE MOSTLY GREAT BUT THE 2 GUITAR SOLOS HAVE LOST THE SPARK.FARAH SOUNDED GREAT ON ACOUSTIC STEEL STRING ON THE FIRST ALBUMS, KIND OF LIKE AL DIMEOLA, THERE SHOULD BE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TONE OF THEIR GUITARS FOR THEM TO SHINE MORE, BUT THE FORMULA IS THE SAME AND LIKE MANY PEOPLE I HAVE TALK TO, THE MAGIC IS GONE.JUST LISTEN TO QUETZAL FROM THE ALBUM FRONTERA AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN.RIO DE COLORES IS NOT THEIR BEST AND IT HAS 2 TUNES RECORDED BY STRUNZ BY HIMSELF, THOSE ARE MY FAVORITES BECAUSE THEY SOUND FRESH. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A NEW JORGE STRUNZ ALBUM. SOLO."
3,Never go to Belize without a tour guide handy...,"from the mad mind of MARK ATKINS.Kind of a cool `Predator homage' in the found footage genre of Faux-Docs.There is real suspense in capture scenes and female lead comes off as a honest person wanting knowledge for her documentary.Some of the camera work is new,Atkins is known more as a Director-Of-Photography for most of ASYLUM films and he always films out of country .GREAT poster too."
4,Nice gloves for the price,"Nice product for a few bucks, warm and comfortable. Okay for dry, cold weather but nothing wet or subzero. Makes them perfect for out in California for our severe (45 deg.) winter days."
3,gloves,"The gloves are nice, but you ruined the Christmas surprise by your incessent emails asking how I liked them."
1,Fantasy!,"I probably shouldn't give this book a number rating because I was not aware when I tried to start this series that it was a fantasy mystery series. Anyway, not my cup of tea at all. People turning into cats, and cats talking and making telephone calls! Sorry, I can't say anything more about this book, but I will not continue the series."
2,Playin for the Kitty,"When I first saw""Playin for the kitty"" I thought it was a joke. The whole movie was a discrace to the black film industry. The lighting, script, and actors were horrible. The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack. The plot was hard to follow and made no sense. I think I could have done a better job with this movie. The people on the cover aren't even in the movie. What's that all about?"
2,One of the few films in Dallas,"One of the few films in Dallas, Texas and it's horrible. I didn't like seeing a token white guy in the movie in one scene. Why was he there? I do filming and could have done a better job. I would have at least changed the bedroom to be different instead of having love scenes in the same bed."
5,"Great, funny, moving book","the bookwas funny, but got its point across about unwanted dogs. There is a big issue inthe country and others with unwanted dogs and what is worse, it is our fault, not the dogs'. My only issue was I wish there was more content."
5,LOVE FLAWED DOGS,the imagination and humor is amazingly funny. i can look through the book over and over and see something different and fun. i share this with my grandsons. i like to use it to expand their imaginations. to let them know there is no limit to the mind.gena lee
4,Great Illustration,I bought this book because of my familiarity with Berke Breathed and was not disappointed. The subject matter is very sad but Breathed manages to make it amusing as well. Very heartwarming.
4,Great book!,Breathed is such a great writer and he relates so well to children but also to adults. I own quite a few of his books.
3,For mature kids? Maybe,"Flawed Dogs is truly a work of art. Great illustrations. This is the 2004 catalogue of the PIDDLETON DOG POUND's very available leftovers who just *may* have some minor blemishes. We have everything from the dog who's all tongue to the hairball that calls itself a dog. There's a tatooed dog and a teeny dog, an old fart of a dog and a three footed dog. Almost guarenteed to give you at least one (if not more) good laugh!But do take caution, Parents and other adults may find this book somewhat disturbing. Some crude humor + somewhat mangled dogs.However, I don't really see that much harm in it. True, this is not for preschoolers but most kids find this book hilariously amusing. It's a great book and I think it's okay for kids to see. Enjoy your trip to Piddleton!"
4,Strange,"Title says it, strange little book. Probably my least-favorite Berkeley Breathed book, but well-done and well-illustrated."
4,Turned out well.,My son put it on 5 sec. after he opened the package. Scared his little sister. Four more words req.
5,Vox et Abbey! Fantastic little book!,"After Ed's passing, there were many holes, despite the prolific nature of the self proclaimed bastard. This small book offers a wonderful insight into the man behind the Monkey Wrench. Through his journals, poems and other unpublished work, another ray of desert sunlight falls upon Ed's hulking form. We miss you Abbey, but this eases the emptiness a little"
2,Skip it!,"Edward Abbey is quite possibly the most overrated author of the 20th Century. For proof, look no further then this little book of pseudo-wisdom. You'll have the pleasure of watching as Ed spouts tiresome untruths (all government is bad, all science is bad, all rebels are good, etc.) with the petulant attitude that he is the very first person in history to say them all, and that it makes him great. Environmentalists who think that Abbey was some kind of hero might be shocked by the elitist arrogance of this ""man of the people"" (he thanks nuclear physicists for inventing the atomic bomb) or by right-wing moronics worthy of the most brainless militiaman (""the rifle and handgun are 'equalizers'--the weapons of a democracy""). Abbey even puts the s-word in print and brags about it as if he were the first person on the planet to do it. If you are an environmentalist (like me) and you want inspiration, read Emerson, read John Muir, even read Wendell Berry--but skip Edward Abbey."
1,Does not work on Mac,"Not mac compatible, don't buy it if you have a mac. Not mac compatible, don't buy it if you have a mac."
1,"""File not found"" Ugh!!!","When we load this game into our computer the wizard starts like it should....then halfway through install it says ""file not found"" then ""uninstall"". Not even my brother, ""The Computer Geek"" could get it to work.... Just bad luck??? Complete disappointment...Love the DS version I got to replace it for my daughter!!!"
5,Thought-provoking,"This is a very personal and inspiring peek at the other side of death, and it is filled with interesting notions about our relationship to/with the cosmos. It includes discussions with God, a difficult thing to contemplate, and approaches the great question of existence with both humor and ennui. Few books contain ideas that keep me up at night, thinking, wondering, but this is one of those rare tomes that kept my mind spinning long after I had closed the cover. In fact, it was so interesting that I know I'll read it more than once."
5,"A Pleasant, Thought-Provoking Read","After reading about three-quarters of a borrowed copy of Never Too Busy for You, I chose to purchase my own. The book was a quick read for me. In fact, I had difficulty putting it down.Many questions and conversations in the book reminded me of converstaions I have had with friends and loved ones over time regarding God, the after-life, and our place in eternity. I eagerly anticipate Mr. Lucado's next novel."
4,99' updated,"Well from playing the 99' version to the 2000 version. I was hoping for some more updates, a lot more. I was disapointed. Nothing special from 99' I think their about the same, nothing really different. Sure there is a few things but nothings drastic. Maybe the next addition will have more. Still a good game though, the beginning video is cool. So i'll give it 4 stars."
4,The start of a great Madden series begins here.,"This game would have of had a five if the graphics were better and the commentary was improved. The graphics aren't that great and you will get used to the dull colors used in the game. The commentary should be more like ""Madden"" or my favorite Chris Bergman to keep you on your toes. He says the same thing over and over again. But you can't get to perfection in that area. What I liked about the game is the franchise mode. You can sign Free Agents, Release players, Negotiate Contracts, and have a Draft. One thing that bugged me was if a lineman caught an onside kicked it will only track his kickoff stats for the rest of the season. Also what keeps the game alive is the 2000 Madden Points you need to get. Everything from catching a 30 yard pass to beating Green Bay at Lambeau Field. If you want a great buy and don't got much money go here. But if you do have money buy Madden 2001 for PS2 if you got one but for playstation it is still good."
5,I love this game,"I got this game for my birthday a couple of years ago. Ever since ive been hooked i won the super bowl, had an undefeated season and completed all of the madde challenges. It is very creative and has good graphics, it is also very realistic. Ive never had any problems with it and if you buy it youll love it too."
1,i want my money back,"yea the game is great, but the disk scratches up too easily. I want my money back. My Madden stopped working on the second day i had it."
4,Yeah Baby Yeah!,"I thought this game was most likely the best madden game yet. The graphics were great, the gameplay was real, the teams were up to date and all in all it was fun! Unlike all football games this one had REAL commentary. It's as if you turn on the tv and find that you're watching a football game. The only bad part is that there is a salry cap to your trading limit, so you can't build your dream team."
5,Madden Football at its best! tip: don't buy gameday!,Okay where do I start... Well if you like anything about football you will like this! I have five games that I love including this and this is the only sports game. No game comes close to this one not gameday not Blitz not Extreme no way. This is a must buy for everybody! And I don't work for EA sports and I'm certnialy not John madden!
5,Madden 2000,"Madden 2000 is the best Madden game released so far, you can play different leagues like Franchise play were you can sign players and negotiate their contracts, The game also has regular season and normal exhibition play. This is the best NFL game so far released for PSX"
1,"Good chocolate, but bait and switch","I did not receive the item advertized here. It was not the ""Bar"" pictured in the Amazon ad, but the bar-shaped package of small individual pieces. Its not the same thing at all, and I did not get what I paid for. I could have bought these at Walmart for a lot less. I had my wife give them out at Christmas and didn't realize until several had been opened that I'd not received what I purchased."
2,New Ash Album,"I've had Meltdown for a few months now as I had purchased it as an import when it was originally released. I'm not sure why Ash decided to go metal after an impressive ""Free All Angels"". There might be a memorial song or two on ""Meltdown"" but that is about it. In addition, I got a chance to view the new material live last week in Philly and was not impressed. The Bravery single handledly stole the show. I was hoping that Ash would continue where the ""Envy"" single left off but they opted for a u-turn."
2,Disappointing - try Muse instead,"This CD sounded good, and I should have liked it. Strong themes, lead vocals, guitar work, female background vocalist... but the lyrics are just sophomoric. Every song is either ""we're such rebels, you're all clones"" or ""she's so sexy."" These guys should be able to pen some meatier prose, they're over 16.So go get Muse's ""Origin of Symmetry"" or ""Absolution"" instead for great guitars, vocals AND lyrics."
4,Solid Hard Rock,"Though they've made their reputation on fast punky singles, the Ash songs that have spoken the most to me in the past have been mid-tempo songs about love's longing (""Shining Light"", ""Folk Song"") or downright dirges (1977's ""Gone the Dream""). So my approach to Meltdown, their fifth proper release after a collection of singles and b-sides (Intergalactic Sonic 7s), was not so much skepticism as dread when I'd read they were forsaking lyricism for rocking out. Yet Tim Wheeler and his able bandmates find their own lyricism in the 4/4 - they not only muscle up (some of these tunes are damn near metallic) but provide a few twists to hard rock's standard themes. So, for instance, ""Orpheus"" is both paean to ""the open road"" and the mythological character, and ""Won't Be Saved's"" iconic rebel remains despondent even as he pledges the eternal love that damns him. The songs that merely appropriate the hard rock verities get by on how hard that rock actually is."
5,An Instant Classic!,"I've been playing golf sims since back-in-the-day (any body remember PGA Tour Golf for the MAC?) and I gotta say Mario Golf is one of the most addictive golf games out there. It has meets all the requirement for a good golf sim: several courses, different charactors with different strengths and weaknesses, adequate graphics (considering the limitations of the GameBoy platform)..etc. But what truly makes this game great is what I can only describe as the ""Japanese Approach"" to sports sims. Unlike most golf sims you cannot rip the ball 300 + yards the first time you play the game. Much like real golf, you must gain experience on both the course and practice facilites. It may seem a little frustrating as first but stick with it you'll have a great time."
2,Boring!,"I love to golf but I disliked this game. It was very boring and the players drives were very short,and the computer was almost impossible to beat. I can't understand how this game got such good ratings."
5,Mario Golf for GBC is the bomb diggity!,"Mario Golf, unlike many Gameboy games, has that distinct pick-up-and-play capability along with the challenge of the best RPG. The graphics are astounding for GBC, and any Gameboy game with the ability to pack 5 courses into one game must be a winner. So we have winning graphics, along with killer play control. There is the typical power meter bar, and menu selections are simple. Finally, we reach the game design. It plays like a golf RPG, where by beating mini-games and placing in tournaments one increases drive, direction of shot, meet area, and control. It is a fun and challenging scenario that has endless possibilities. And unlike most RPGs, the replay value is great! Finally, the sounzd includes recurring Mairo themes as well as new, interesting music. Overall, this game is a definite winner!"
5,"Best Game Boy Game, Period!","Mario Golf for the Game Boy Color isn't just the best golf sim for the Game Boy, it's the best game I've ever played on any handheld system, ever! The replay value, even after you've found all the games secrets and met it's goals, is endless. Whether or not you're a fan of golf or golf games, no Game Boy collection is complete without Mario Golf."
4,Smells great,Surf Detergent gets the job done and the Spring Burst scent smells fresh. I don't know how ecstatic you can get about laundry detergent but this is a pretty good detergent for the money.
3,Good for light duty not heavy duty,"Product appeared to be well made, however the adjustable spray tip left a lot to be desired. It leaked and dripped all over the place and did not spray evenly. I called the company and asked if I needed a different spray tip for my application and was told that the one I had was best for my application. I was not satisfied with how it operated or worked. It has been returned. The tank was nice and heavy. I believe this would work well for exterior applications where you are not worried about excess drip or having a consistent spray pattern. Interior applications look elsewhere."
1,never again,doesnt work like you think it would. nothing but problems with this item... not sturdy always tipps over and floats.... do not buy this. waste of your time and money because you also have to buy tubing and an air pump
1,Not a good buy,"I think this book does not fulfil its promises. In fact, it is way beneath the level of graduates, to whom this book is also targeted at. The advice given is too shallow and general, and does not point out the specifics of good writing. Examples are too few in number and insubstantial in content, and though they may occassionally succeed at being a little funny, are not desirable examples that would enlighten readers on what a ""smart"" piece of writing would be like. Overall, this is a disappointment, and way below expectations. Princeton Review should be embarassed to have published such a piece."
1,Writing Smart What?,I saw this in a bookstore and almost cried. The Princeton Review needs to review the definition of an adverb.
4,I'm confused,"Seems as though this starts in the middle but I am trying to figure out why that is. Seriously, it's like there was no beginning...very weird"
3,"Does magnify a little, reduces brightness a little.","I'm not so sure about ""doubling"". Yes, it does increase magnification a little, and dims the display a little. It's not very spectacular, it depends on your needs at the moment. If you really need to zoom in a little more, and it isn't so dark that you can afford the slightly dimmer output, that may be what you need. Also, it is heavy, and adds both weight and size to the front of the Night Owl unit. With the lens doubler attached, the Night Owl will not fit in its storage pouch. It screws on with fine threads, be careful! Attaching/removing the doubler is not fast, not something you will want to do constantly. There is not storage pouch included with the doubler."
1,Lens Doubler order form is misleading,"The product did not fit the Night Owl Night Vision I purchased as advertised. The special offer lens form that come with the packaging(Doubler)is misleading. The lens doubler will not fit all Night Owl Optics Night Vision. When I detached the original lens, I could no screw the doubler on. The lens was to big for the model I purchased. The lens fits other models -attachs to the front of the original lens. The special offer form should only be put in the model packaging that will fit the lens.I was able to give the lens to a co-worker."
2,can't trust what you read or see in 4 this one...,the cross is really 1 1/2 tall...the ring that holds the cross to the chain is a cheap wire.i am not happy.
1,Cross is ok. Chain is totally useless!,"I ordered this item recently and it arrived promptly. However, the chain was as thin as I've ever seen and immediately broke. Be prepared to order a chain upon receiving this item as the one it comes up with is completely useless!"
5,Great Semi Professional Unit,This unit is very comfortable for my patients. It is simple enough to teach them home traction as well. You'll love it.
3,First Impressions,"Just finished this tape for the first time.Not what I would recommend for beginners,try GAIAM Pilates for weightloss.I have tried 6 or 7 pilates tapes this year looking for the perfect intermediate step after 4 months of using Gaiam/PFW.Pilates for Everybody will likely stay in my weekly rotation but its not somthing I would use most of the time.I felt really energized after the warmup. The challenge in this program is exactly what I need, but the reason I most love pilates is the simplicity of the moves, not needing equipment, or shoes, just a real good mat is a must have! Half of the workout is with the resistance band and a lot of work is done with a chair...call me lazy.. I just want to get on the floor, take the weight off my back (former surgery) and still feel like I'm working hard."
2,Not for anyone familiar with Pilates,"If you are not a Pilates beginner, don't waste your time with this video. The only moves that really gave me a Pilates workout was the ""ballet"" legwork at the end. The warm-up is simply a regular aerobic warm-up, not using Pilates at all. I will definitely continue using this video for the fabulous leg work I remember from my days as a ballet dancer, but other than that, it was a waste."
4,Good item,"I bought this item as a gift for my daughter-in-law, who was teaching Pilates at the time. I don't know if she liked it or not."
5,Good DVD,"This was shipped quickly and in good shape. I've always loved Denise Austin's instruction and encouragement. I wish I would have known the workout uses a band, but even doing it without the band seemed to work. She mixed in yoga for stretching and did a total body workout."
2,Beginners look elsewhere,"I bought this thinking ""everybody"" meant it was beginner level pilates. I am admittedly not in good shape and found this to be way too difficult to attempt right now. Even when I work my way up to the level demonstrated, I don't know if I could stand doing the workout--Denise talks nonstop all the way through it and has the most annoying nasal voice!! She must be in incredible shape to be able to talke all the way through a work out like this!! Even if you turn her down, her expressions are so fake she looks like a mime doing pilates. I think I'll sell this at a used DVD store...."
2,a pity,"It's a pity that Denise Austin's high whispery voice is way too annoying. So, therefore, i find it impossible to workout with this video."
1,Awful!!!!!!,This is the worst work-out video I have ever seen. Denise Austin seems to rushing through each exercise as if she has a plane to catch. She does not take the necessary time to demonstrate correct form for any of her exercises. I did not benefit from this video.I would not recommend this video.
3,"Great exercise - annoying, over-talkative person","I agree with everyone on this post. The workout is great and challenging, but she is SO annoying. I have to do the workout with her on mute. Unless you like some shrill, harsh little voice telling you ""That's it"" and ""Let's see that beautiful smile"" over and over, you will too. A resistance band is highly recommended, and is some nice soothing music to listen to over her. I would not recommend this to anyone who is just started with pilates. Unless you are a dancer or have been doing yoga or pilates for while, most of the moves will be too difficult to do and understand for someone who hasn't had any exposure to this kind of movement. Although they're on TV all the time and a little more expensive than most other DVDS, I think Winsor Pilates are the best. Everything is clearly explained and different levels of ability are addressed."
1,The Worst Pilates Workout Out There!!!!,"I read some of the reviews on Amazon before I purchased this, and I thought some were kind of harsh.....turns out they were dead on! I wonder if Denise Austin really knows what she's doing at all! She's annoying as ever, and she has a creepy, psuedo ""awake"" and cheery stare.....ugh! You will have nightmares for days with images of her prancing around crooning 'nice, tall body!!!' Please someone make it stop!!! You're better off trying Crunch Fat Blasting Pilates, because Denise really screws up pilates for EVERYBODY in this one!!!"
2,Dear God...,"Where to start?? Well,if you are a beginner to pilates this is not the video to test the waters. I was very excited about this video but was quite disappointed.There is very little instruction for beginners to modify moves, and I understand that Pilates should be fluid with little rigid movement. I am an experienced workout and video buff (a FIRM BELEIVER) but I found this video to be frustrating and I had to force myself to finish. I have yet to try it again, because it is so irritating.I felt unco-oridinated and clumsy, and more than a little irritated with Denise. Her voice, lack of cueing and general presentation sent me back to Amazon to try Pilates for Dummies.Maybe after learning the basics I will try again soon"
1,"Might be a nice workout-but it sure isn't ""real"" pilates","I thought this dvd was terrible! She talks about precise movements and doing things with the correct form, then she is all over the place with her form. Very sloppy. It almost seems like she doesn't know how to do the movements right and just put out a dvd to jump into the pilates marketing craze. If you are really looking for a good basic beginner pilates dvd, get the Crunch Pick Your Spot. That's a great DVD that really does things right and isn't at all boring. This one is just plain annoying."
2,NOT a pilates workout for everybody,"I wouldn't go so far as to give this 1 star. Despite the fact that her voice is annoying, she never shuts up, and her instructions and postures postitions are vague, I did get a small workout. However, this is truely for Beginners Only and isn't a true pilates workout. Also it is decieving because it says you work the whole body but she focuses on the abs the most and doesn't do nearly as much with the thighs. I am not a fan of physical activity and don't do it often, so I expected to be a little challenged, but not with this video."
1,tai chi without form,"I bought the DVD as a gift for my wife at christmas, she had been wanting this particular title instead of a more generic offering. After she watched it she claimed that it was VERY annoying and hard to get past the loud delivery by Denise Austin.She did however find the Tai Chi video to be almost the exact same exercises with actual form and function, and is now using that instead"
3,It's a love/hate thing,"I bought this dvd to expand my pilates library. I had never done a Denise Austin workout before, but knew that she was somewhat popular. At first, I truly hated this dvd. She talks the ENTIRE time, but she doesn't even really explain what she's doing. It's hard to follow her, and if this had been my first experience with pilates, I am sure I would not be interested in it at all.So here's my dilemma - she's annoying as can be, but this dvd really did give me a good workout!!! And for that, I hate it...because now I think I have to forget the original plan of returning it, and keep it since it really did work me out well. I am figuring that after I've done it a few times, I will be able to go along with it, put replace her annoying talking with some nice music.Bottom line: This is NOT my favorite workout dvd. I really enjoy The Crunch's Pick Your Spot Pilates and MTV's Yoga...I think my next purchase will be the MTV Pilates."
1,do not purchase this DVD,"This DVD seems to have been recorded, then put on a higher speed and sold to customers. The exercises are not necesarily too dificult to do, but the speed Denise is speaking/exercising at is first, annoying, and second not likely to be followed by any body.I have one of her DVDs which is much better: it's called Mat Workout based on the work of J.H. Pilates.Save your money, and do not buy Pilates for Every Body. Not worth it."
4,"This video reshapes your hips, thighs, and butt!","After high school, I really didn't pay much attention to keeping in shape. I got a bit soggy in the mid-section and thighs. When a friend told me to try Pilates, I went straight for Denise Austin, knowing that her enthusiastic ""You can do it!"" attitude would help me. After one month of alternating this video with the mat workout video (seven days a week), I've had great results. Many of my coworkers and family ask me if I've lost weight. I lost maybe 8 lbs., but this video totally reshapes your body! My fiance and some friends have noticed a definite change in the size and shape of my thighs, my clothes fit better, and I feel great after this workout. Keep in mind, if you really want great results, you also need to do a bit of aerobics, like the Sizzler."
3,"Not good enough for 4 or 5 stars, but better than 1 or 2","This tape is only okay. I think it's kind of boring and moves rather slow. Denise is a good instructor, but I think this video is better for beginners. If you are the type of person who likes a lot of movement and aerobic type workouts this isnt for you. I usually use this tape on my rest days from my aerobic more intense workouts. Although I must say she does great movements that work the abs."
2,not pilates!,"I was very disappointed in this video. According to the box the exercises use ""...correct form, proper breathing, and mental focus..."". I did not feel properly instructed in any of these aspects. Other pilates tapes have been signifcantly more instructive. In particular, I found her form bad if not harmful to the back. I would not recommend this."
1,"Denise Austin, pilates for every body","This is the worst pilates video ever made. Miss Austin is very good in her other videos but it is obvious to someone who is experience in pilates that she does not know nearly enough about this wonderful form of controlled movement excercise to teach it correctly. Classical pilates , Stotts , Winsor and Ana Caban's just to name a few, are very good . You can tell these people have studied Pilates for many, many years. Thank you , Mary Lyon, Certified Pilates Instructor."
2,Could be better,"This workout could be better. I expected it to get me more toned, but I haven't seen the results yet.I have tried other videos such as the IM=X Pilates series and they are much more effective. Hopefully those videos will be available on Amazon.com soon."
3,Ok workout but looking for more,"The dvd states that it's for every body, which isn't true because the sole purpose of this dvd is to tone the body. As another poster stated, this isn't for the beginner. If you're looking to lose a lot of weight, this isn't for you. However, if you're in shape and looking to tone your body, then this would be ideal.I must admit that this workout did help me a little. It helped to trim the waistline. I'm able to wear a pair of jeans that were a little too tight for me at the waist, which is great.My sole problem with this workout is that I don't think it's demanding enough. I'd like something that lets me exert more sweat. So I'm giving this a ok rating, it's better than not doing anything."
3,for pilates-experienced only,"Overall this a good workout, with a caveat: a beginner should start with a different instructor, such as Moira Stott, who gives a much more thorough explanation of what you're doing, why you're doing it, how to avoid strain and injury, and modifications for your particular situation. How can Denise talk so much and say so little? That said, it is a good head-to-toe exercise program. Just turn the volume down and listen to music instead."
3,Not for beginners!,"I am unfortunately out of shape and have heard a lot about Pilates and thought I'd give this DVD a try. Well, it is rather fast paced and I do not recommend this DVD to someone who is a beginner. Denise Austin is way too cheerful and the camera switching angles gets rather annoying. However, I definitely felt the burn but did not feel ""energized."" I will continue to work out to this DVD in hopes that some day I can actually achieve her V position!"
2,not for beginners,"I bought this DVD as a part of my new weight loss and fitness plan. I was somewhat familiar with the principles of Pilate, but I found that Denise Austin moved too quickly from one exercise to the next. She spent no time explaining the various positions and moved from a basic form to an advanced form in the blink of an eye. Even after watching the tape all the way through, I couldn't figure out what she was doing. This DVD may be suitable to people who are already very familiar with Pilates and correct form, but it's definitely not for beginners."
2,"Good material, bad format","This book comprises the earliest issues of MAD, which were fantastic, and featured the work of comics legend, Wallace Wood among others. But be warned: The book is trade paperback sized, and THE ORIGINAL PAGES ARE ROTATED AND PRINTED ACROSS THE SPINE. The book should just be reprinted with a page per page layout, then I wouldn't have gotten the headache reading it that I did."
5,This is a very fun book.,"When I first opened it and read it i read alomost the whole thing. It is a very fun read, but dont read it all al once, it makes you get very sick of the book and you wont want to read it again."
2,THIS IS IN NO WAY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ''FIRST BLOOD'',"RAMBO RETURNS TO GO TO VIETNAM TO RESCUE SOME AMERICAN PRISONERS. SURE, RAMBO HAS A MUCH BIGGER CHALLENGE IN THIS MOVIE, BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. THE STORY LINE HERE LACKS DEPTH AND THE ACTION AIN'T NO DIFFERENT FROM A ''MISSING IN ACTION'' MOVIE. UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL ''FIRST BLOOD'', THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE MINDED ACTION MOVIE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF REALISM. STALLONE IS STILL GOOD AS RAMBO."
2,Stallone,Stallone stars in this sequel to First Blood. Nominated for an Oscar. John Rambo goes to Vietnam in search of American POWs. This is a very fakey movie. Stick with Rocky...
2,"A merciful 2 star rating, Crenna is as good as ever but Stallone's attempt @ Bo Gritz is getting worn!","Once again poor Jonny Be Good 'Rambo',with his steroid encased muscles isbeing picked on and once again nearlyeverything gets blow up! Even Ahnuld'sCommando is better, and that's not say-ing much! Instead of a blow-by-blow de-tail oriented review, I will enliten thereader with a rating of the entire 8 filmsbased on the above mentioned premise:1) Missing in Action, (2) Uncommon Valour,(3) P.O.W. - The Escape, (4) Missing inAction II, (5) Rambo: First Blood, (6)Missing in Action III, (7) Rambo: FirstBlood II, (8) Rambo: First Blood III"
1,Didn't the US loose the Vietnam war?,"Didn't the United States loose the war in Vietnam? Or I am just out on a limb here?Next week: Rambo goes to Afghanistan, to aid al-Qaeda and the Taliban against the evil Russians..."
2,Action flick for twelve-year-olds,"First Blood was a pretty good movie, and had a point. Rambo is an action movie for twelve-year-olds, and the script seems like it was written by one. It has all the subtlety of a speech by Ronald Reagan (Rambo's biggest fan), and all the relevance of a speech by Dubya Bush (Rambo's biggest legacy).""They have our men, let's go kill 'em all!!""Sure, intelligent people don't take their world views from popular entertainment, but last time I looked, the world was not populated chiefly by intelligent people, notice that?"
2,PAINFULLY BAD ! 2 STARS IS GENEROUS!,"From The opening cheesey TV movie style music you know your in for something bad! The original First Blood is a very good movie, but this film is silly(even for a picture of this nature)with wooden performances by all. How did they ever talk Crenna into this picture? He is the only saving grace. I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch this picture, but I though I would be entertained......I was not!....I found myself nodding off! This is hard to believe considering the monsterous sub woofer I have in my theater. I am not looking forward to part 3, but we do what we have to do! For those interested the DVD transfer and extras are too good for this picture."
4,maybe go america,"rambo is back and better than ever in this highly dramatic sequel. with happiness dangled in front of his nose and the chance for freedom slipping away, he is forced to deal a death blow to the ever antagonizing russian communists. worth a watch for sure. do do do do"
1,Stallone the Yo-Yo,"Next to Rocky, this character of Stallone's will go down in history as the worst thing since Lee Majors. I was disappointed with the lack of logic to this movie, unlike the first which was good. After this, is the most horrific movie sequel to have ever been released since the killer tomatoes films."
1,Cheese-Ballin',"I've never laughed so hard in my life! I am a big Stallone fan, but you have to admit - all the lines everyone's says are SO CHEESY!!!! Here's an example: ""To win a war, you must become war"" (ooohh I'm scared), (with the lightning in the background) ""Murdock, I'm coming to get you."", and the famous line - ""Find 'em, or I'll find you!"". Wow, what 80's independence cheese-ball lines I've ever heard. Can you believe James Cameron helped Sly to do the screenplay for this? If you want a good Rambo movie, Rambo I and III are the best. Don't touch this one unless you want a good laugh."
2,Too dumb,"The first movie was fantastic, but this lame second one was a real dissapointment. I too saw this movie originally in the theaters when I was in the Army. No one fires a LAW while inside of anything (even a building unless you have it well ventilated). And you also make sure that the people you are trying to rescue aren't right behind it. He would have killed everybody (other helicopter, his rescuees, and himself) had he really fired the missile.On top of that it also introduced a bunch of Russians into an era and situation that they had no reason to be in. A much much better movie is ""Uncommon Valor"".It is too bad because this could have been a great sequel."
4,You have to escape reality to watch this one,Just temporarily discard your sense of reality for a couple of hours and cheer this fictitious American hero on! There are plenty of exciting action scenes and vivid cinematography in this film where Stallone plays an enlarged GI Joe doll that's come to life.
3,"Classic Movie, Unimpressive Blu-Ray","This, of course, is a great classic movie, and many of the reviews for this product are rating the movie (and in standard DVD format, no less), rather than the quality of its Blu-Ray presentation.As far as the Blu-Ray presentation goes, I was underwhelmed. I didn't do a direct compare, but casually watching it, the visuals and sound did not seem any different to me than the standard DVD presentation. The Blu-Ray does contain a documentary and ""Out of the Blu"" Trivia Track that are not on the DVD, but has the same commentary from the director and no additional features.I'm slowly converting my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, but I'm doing it primarily for the enhanced visuals and sound. This Blu-Ray just didn't deliver that for me, so I'm glad I rented it first."
5,"Great movie, forget what the critics say","Rambo First Blood Part 2 continues where the first film left off. It's a very entertaining movie, even if some parts are predictable or a little ridiculous. Rambo single handedly saves an entire camp of Vietnam POWs, killing everyone with a knife or arrow and even flying a helicopter.If you can get past that (or if you like cheesy stuff like that) I think you'll really like the movie. Is there significant ""character development"" or do people talk about their feelings? No way. If that's the kind of movie you want to see, go see a chick flick. This more than makes up for Rambo not even killing anyone in the first movie, Rambo First Blood.Rambo II will always be one of my favorite action movies"
4,"Politics, not cinema","I saw ""Rambo"" when it first came out, and it stands out more now for its political dimensions than for its cinematic qualities.It may seem odd, but America tried to tell itself...for quite a while... that it had won the war in Vietnam. ""Rambo"" said something vividly that may seem uncontroversial today, namely that we had lost in Vietnam. We lost, not because of the failure of the military, but because of a failure of political will. Our Soldiers weren't allowed to win.If you weren't old enough to see this movie when it came out, you need to see it just because it is referenced and parodied by so many other films."
3,What were they thinking,"the previous DVD of Rambo III is better than this version because, it had more special features minus the Afganistan feature and the subtitle translations of the russian when they are speaking russian are gone so you have no clue what they are saying but since the previous version of Rambo III is out of stock, you have no choice but to get this crapy ""Special Edition""."
5,Excellent!!!,"In my opinion, this is a smidgen below the first one. But it is only a smidgen. It is excellent nonetheless. Suspence, action, drama, Sly... what more do you want in a movie?"
2,A LIVE ACTION COMIC THAT RONALD REAGAN MUST LOVE,"The only good thing about this piece of schlock is that it wasn't boring.It doesn't do much justice to real life vietnam vets nor does it hide any pretense of portraying realism in war.My favorite scene has to be when RAMBO was in the helicopter and he fired a LAW without taking a shred of damage to himself or his copter.If you want an action movie without much intelligence,check it out."
1,False Advertising and Horrible Customer Service,"Hat purchased said ""one size fits all"". This may be true as long as you are a child or a small woman. The hat was too small for me and I am 5-11 and 170 pounds. Too small and the flap part did not cover my neck. Ad says the flap is 8 inches long and it was only 6 inches at most. I contacted the company and their customer service guy needs some training. He called me a lier and said ""that's too bad, the hat fits and the flap is long enough. Why are you bothering me?"" They would not refund the shipping cost, so now I am out the $6 they charged to ship a little girls hat."
4,Wow,"I live in Germany, and even though I have no clue what the words mean, I still love that one song, Und Wenn Ein Lied, and everytime I hear it, the radio goes on fullblast. I am not sure about the rest of the album, but I am impressed with the single. I suggest it to anyone, b/c I am about to purchase it myself right now."
2,boring and over rated,"I am a Lorin Maazel fan. I had no idea, however, that his R. Strauss tempi and balances were so boring. I was completely let down by these recordings. the only bonus was the recording technology they chose to employ, but overall, it was a total waist of time and money."
1,A waste,"I used it on a MAC. It might identify a virus but it won't fix it so you have to delete the file. Gee, brilliant. And not at all helpful. Don't waste your money."
4,Easy Choice,"I buy this pattern for my daughter-in-law Candice as she begins her collection. I have shopped all over town, on line, and even consignment stores and I go back to Amazon each time and for good reason. I get what I want, when I want it, and at a price that is generally below everyone else (including the manufacturer's site). At the least it is the same price in some places but I trust Amazon. In all the years I have made purchases - many, many, purchases I have never been disappointed. If I were, I know I can return it without fanfare, arguement or stress. The pattern is lovely, the process is pleasant and I am a satisfied customer."
2,Good if you read tab,"I bought this and returned it. I can't read mandolin tab. If you're like me and need standard notation for your mandolin music, buy the fiddler's fakebook. Same songs, similar introductory material, and it's in standard notation. That's where I'm going now, to order the fiddle book. But if you read tab, this book will suit you fine."
1,book dident ship yet,"This guy sucks i ordered my book a few days ago and he still hasn't shipped it ,I'm pissed."
2,Madden2000,I thought Madden 2000 was really confusing.The controls are hard. This game is horrible for people who don't like football video games or who have never played them.
2,Confusing and Frustrating,"While Madden NFL 2000 was a fun game, I found it very difficult to learn to use. It wasn't playing the exhibition games that was difficult-that was very easy-it was the other features. The instruction booklet that comes with the game offers little advice on how to do anything. You were supposed to be able to create your own plays, make your own players, and enter codes. I couldn't figure out how to do any of that. The graphics were nice, but nothing special. In fact, they seemed about the same as those from other games and earlier years."
1,Terrible!!!!,When i first bought this game i thought that this was going to be fun. But when i got home i couldnt get the controls at all!Belive me that when I was playing this game it took me at least 10 minutes just to figure out how to pass!!! I urge you if you are looking for a football game please consier any of the NFL Blitz titles. The only good part about this game was the price (...). I hope that my review was helpful to you
4,Madden 2k,"I purchased this game so that I could compete with my friends on their PS2 version. It is different in a lot of ways. But, I have found the game to be alot of fun. Normally when I play my wife because she is horrible at games. But anyway, really the game is great and alot of fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that you can not save anything on the game without an expense pack. Good thing it is priced good here.... Anyway get the game its pretty cool!!!"
4,"Great game, but not perfect","Madden NFL 2000 is a great NFL game. There are deep playbooks for every team, gameplay, while difficult to get the hang of at first, becomes easy after your first few games. One of the biggest hang-ups for me is that it's very easy to burn defenses with the same plays, even in the higher difficulty modes. I have sometimes used the same 10 plays over and over and won games 56-10. The AI also run predictable offense, such as, when on the goalline, they will almost always run the ball, and goalline D will flatten them every time. The franchise mode, however, is excellent, and is the most enjoyable part for me, building a dynasty from the ground up. Graphics are wonderful. Despite the sometimes weak AI, I still give this game 4 stars. It's the best NFL game I have played."
4,Madden Y2K,"This Madden improves yet again on the previous version. Game play is better and more realistic. Finally you can run effectively between the tackles on a video football game. Passing is still tough as players are always double-teamed. The Franchise mode allows you to pilot a team for many years, with drafts, re-signing of players in the off-season, and many more features. The only feature they left off this year is the Fantasy Draft. It was included in Madden '99, but misteriously disappeared from this year. Overall, a very good and realistic football game."
4,After one day and 5 games...,"...I already enjoy this game. It's not quite as smooth as I would like, and each player, even the skinny wide receivers, looks like a professional body-builder, but overall, the graphics are excellent.I've played many versions of video game football, starting with the old Atari 2600, and have been impressed each year with the newest and latest game systems.The only problem I have with the game is that it is difficult to learn easily. I have found also that running is so ridiculously easy when you have a speedy back, even when you run the same play over and over. The passing game, meanwhile, is difficult to manage for a novice, and even when I was using the NFC All-Pro team, I found it hard to make completions."
2,Plate separated from base,"Was pleased with this cake plate initially. However, after about four uses, the glue holding the plate to the base came loose. I plan on gluing it back on, hoping for some further use, but the quality could have been better."
5,Unrivaled,"First music review I've ever written--Can't tell you how much I love this CD! Biggest frustration is, now that I love it so much, can't find anything else by the same artist nor anything else that comes close to comparing. All the other piano music out there sounds so blahh after this. Also, the songs are long, and so the short samples offered here on Amazon don't quite do it justice. Don't miss out--highly recommended!"
5,Archaeology of the Sumer Delta,"This book deals with archaeological evidence of the Sumer region in a comprehensive and highly illustrated volume. Crawford's book has little to do with the historical view of Sumer like so many other books on the subject. However, she does not wonder far from most traditional views of the Sumerians and always backs those views up with a hard archaeological background. The book covers the physical environment of Sumer, social organisation, Settlement and agriculture patterns, (temple, town, housing architecture), some religious background of Sumer, Manufacturing, trade and lastly the beginnning of literature in Sumer. I suggest this book for any archaeology student interested in the use of technic in the field and evidence gathered from those technics. Crawford's book is a very educational read of the root of Mesopotamian civilsation ""Sumer""."
4,"Better than expected, a good DVD for the Price!","I just saw this movie last night. I was flipping through the channels and decided to give this one a try. I thought it was going to be lame, but it wasn't! The comedic performances of Angie Harmon's secretary, full of inuendo and some pretty hysterical remarks really made it all worthwhile. John Lovitz and his gold-digger wife also contribute much with their love-hate dialouge. Denise Richards doesn't have a huge part, but does a good job in this comedy. Charlie Sheen, although not usually a favorite of mine, was pretty good in this one, thanks to Angie and her Sec. Enjoy!"
4,Cheesy and Romantic -- worth it,"This movie was actually very entertaining and ironic. A worthwhile buy, especially good for dates."
3,The romantic Sheen,"Though this isn't one of Charlie's best, he actually does a decent job of portraying a high-power investor turned love struck, sensitive columnist. The movie is entertaining and a good choice for the hopeless romantics or those who need a good ""date"" movie."
1,Disappointing,I sent a return notice with know response. This item was sent with defect. I would like to return it!
1,Disaster!,"The product that I ordered was not the product that I have gotten in the past from beauty supply stores. This product was supposed to be gel, but this was a strong chemical scented liquid. Weather could not have been a factor since the product was never in extreme heat while in transit. This was my first bad experience I have ever encountered with online purchases. If you are thinking about ordering this particular product...DON'T!"
4,But why publish something like this in black-and-white?!,"The 15th century armorial reproduced here (not in color, unfortunately), comprises a series of fifty-three striking equestrian figures in full tournament heraldic dress. The boldly drawn figures, most of them of sovereigns and great nobles, are highly stylized, to emphasize the herald's art. Heraldry was still evolving at this time, and works of this kind were creating the precedents still followed today."
3,Best as a team game,"This game is clever and gets you thinking, but it can be very unenjoyable for single players. This game is best with a boisterous crowd."
2,Not so fun if your general knowledge is limited,"We have game night every Sunday night and, based on the reviews, I decided to try out Tribond on the family. There are 6 of us, ages 16 t0 60. We are a smart bunch, but the game hugely favored players with the greatest general knowledge. Two players knew the answers to probably 95% of the questions. The other 4 knew almost no answers. There didn't appear to be a strategy to figuring out the answer either - you either knew it or didn't. So..... we're going back to playing BS, Loaded Questions, Apples to Apples, Charades. We'll save Tribond for a night when the two brainy folks want to play against each other."
3,one of the lamest game boards ever,"the game board is ugly and uninteresting. the clues themselves are ok, but the threesome repition ges boring. find on ebay cheap if you'r di-hrd."
4,I think its good for the price,"I feel that this guitar has all the things most beginers or advanced players need; guitar picks, strings, case, tuner, and I think more. I think I would get it because everybody needs to play a decent guiter once in a while. Why didn't I rate it 5 stars? I rated it 4 stars because im worried about the strings. I dont know if it will make a decent sound or a fakey sound. in other words, i would buy it. It seems nice. But, thats my opinion. TRY IT!"
2,Really?!,So i was so excited to get my guitar... Its nice and all but i never got my careying bag or accessories.. Like really?! But u get wat u pay for obviously
3,Pretty Good Guitar for the Price,"WOWWW! this guitar is pretty good for its price! the paintjob is welldone, but its a yellow brownish, rather than red, like in the picture. There were a few black smudges but none that seem too hard to get rid of. But there was also a part of the guitar where it looked like something had scraped it a little. The sound of the guitar sounds really good and it isnt easily scratched :) It came with everything included, but instead of a guitar tuner, I got a pitch pipe. The shipping time was EXCELLENT. It got shipped as soon as possible. But HOWEVER, the major downside to this guitar, is that the 3rd isnt able to be tuned properly because of either the tuning peg or the string. This really disappointed me because I wasn't able to play anything without it sounding weird.But still, I guess for the price, the looks and sound are really good and the peg could probably be fixed by a proffesional."
1,Concern!!,Mine came without the case or strap! I gave it as a gift and didn't want to point out what was missing when they opened it otherwise I would have returned it. Not cool.
5,Great for the price,"For around thirty-five bucks, you really couldnt ask for more! You get a lot for what you pay here. The quality of everything is obviously not the best, but it seems pretty durable and would be a great toy or first guitar to learn on."
2,Dated,"Believe it or not, I had never actually this before (or any of the Rambo movies). Didn't do much for me - the directing and editing seem pretty dated, and I never felt much sympathy for the lead character. Not as awful as I thought it might be, not as good as I had hoped."
1,WHY DIDN'T HE JUST PAY HIS PARKING TICKET?,"Why didn't Johnny just pay his parking ticket? Does he think he has some kind of special privileges, just because he's from Idaho?Well, I suppose the traffic police (who were just doing their job) picked on the wrong guy..."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Quality Images","I love the movie, by far the best of the Rambo movies. However, the DVD quality was not too good. The movie was very dark, very difficult to watch and really see what was going on."
5,LIFESTYLE!!!,Inspiration for all out cast's!!!Some of the best scenerey ever as well!!!''NOTHINGS OVER''!!!!!
4,It is like stepping into a nightmare,"When your only skill is to kill and you have had enough of that, you tend to wander. This is the circumstance in which we find John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) Vietnam vet. Wandering around in his old field jacket he had the misfortune to bump into, of all people the local macho Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy.) It is the sheriff's duty to protect the community from people wondering around in his/her field jacket.Well push comes to shove when the sheriff verdantly or invariantly draws ""First Blood"". Now nether one can back down and the whole town and surrounding hills becomes a shooting gallery.There is only one man who may be able to save the situation if anyone is willing to listen, but will they? Yep its is Rambo's old commander Col. Samuel Trautman well played by Richard Crenna."
5,"no Ranbo, on I no IV no III , just First Blood","This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels. It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it. There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well. Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to. War. Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue. To potentially misquote Rambo :""I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Let it go..."""
4,"They Drew First Blood , Not Me!!!","With the amount of different versions of the Rambo movies on DVD, you really get the best of both worlds with this one. For years, the very good David Morrel commentary was the highlight until a Sly Stallone version came out... both commentaries are excellent. The transfer is good for a movie that was shot back in 1982, the sound is pretty good. With the amount of ""bubble gum' movies out there, this one is reasonibly priced, great replay value and one of the best Sly movies to boot!!!!"
4,First rate,"Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) runs afoul of the local constabulary while passing through a small town in Washington state. Abused by a sadistic police officer (Jack Starrett), he becomes a fugitive, ultimately going on the offensive when Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) simply refuses to ""let it go.""The film starts out great but becomes a bit too routine toward the end, which features explosions galore. Stallone's physical presence lends great authority to his role, and an impassioned monologue in the film's final moments ends the movie on a powerful note. The gorgeous landscape of the Pacific Northwest provided an excellent setting for the action and was a major reason for my appreciation of this film."
4,Dramatic action classic and one of Stallone's best movies,First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good. The action sequences in the film are intense but below all that is a film with heart that makes you think.
4,"Great story, shame they made the sequels.","A renegade soldier wreaks revenge on the authorities because of the way in which he is treated by cops in this minor classic from the director of COBRA and THE CASSANDRA CROSSING. This first entry in the RAMBO series is no doubt the best, as this one actually portrays John Rambo, played moderately well by Sly Stallone, as a victim of society. Any wonder he loses it? I think it's a shame that the sequels were made, if not for that this movie would get a five star rating, because of the moronic 'we lost Vietnam cos we're pussies' propaganda within them. FIRST BLOOD has none of that. It reflects reality as well - why are war veterans treated badly and the illegal immigrants treated like royalty? Discuss."
3,hmmmmmmmmmmmm,Disgruntled war vet gets angry at small town cops who hassel him. Puts on headband and deerhide and starts kicking ***. Goes overboard when colonel/ex army commander shows up and tells cops that they just ****** off superman. Worth a look though and certainly better than the sequels where superman has an endless supply of exploding arrows. Check out a youthful ex-NYPD blue cop who wants nothing to do with John Rambo.
2,Not what I expected,"It wasn't what I expected when I got this movie on Blu Ray. Because of the fact that there's lots of greenery in this movie, it doesn't mesh very well. Case in point would be the ravine where they were chasing Rambo with the helicopter. The brush was literally blurred as the camera panned thru the valley. Most of the action as the sheriff posse ran thru the forest was blurred also. Yes, my motion settings were set just fine. In fact, I tried adjusting it on the fly and it didn't help. My other Blu Ray's look really good. This one did not... which is disappointing because this was a great movie."
5,good spagetti western but in the modern day.,The plot is simple and Sylvester plays the part brillantly. The whole USA can't stand up to there own creation. Yeah its dumb but its good because he puts so much into the acting. Its Rocky joins the army lol.
1,Good DVD But Incomplete,"This DVD is a good transfer. If you watch the ..,.""edited"" version on tv you get to see the whole movie, minus a couple of graphic scenes and language. The speical edition has missing parts (ie: An entire beginning conversation with the sherif and state Police Chief which makes things clear about what the sherif really thinks and what really happened in his jailhouse), and is no different than the regular version at a cheaper price. This DVD doesn't deserve to be called a ""SPECIAL EDITION"" it has nothing different. Don't waste your money. (Unless you don't have it at all, it's still a good movie)"
3,"Sylvester Stallone drew(plenty of)'1st Blood' over Gene Hackman,Chuck Norris,David Carradine in 1st of 8 movies about Bo Gritz..","[Really 2.5 stars out of four ona normal 1-4 star rating scale.]Yes, Brian Dennehy and Co. had it coming,but the real life 'Rambo', (Rt.) Lt. Col.James Gordon (Bo) Gritz never nearly blewup and entire Oregon town just because afew redneck type sheriff/deputies pissedhim off! Good Special Effects, but theonly decent acting here is turned it byvet character actor Richard Crenna. Don'tget me wrong here; I DO like Stallone inthis formula actioner. But Hackman, Norrisand Carradine are better in; Missing InAction, P.O.W - The Escape and UncommonValour. The best of the three Stalloneentries, as each steer very far away fromoriginal 'Perot sends Gritz and Co. backinto Southeast asia to look for ""P.O.W's-M.I.A's""."
4,4 STARS,I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS THE FUNNYST MOVIE I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE LIKE THE SHAVEING PART STALLONES SCREAMING IN THAT SCENE AND IN THE MOVIE IS FUNNY
5,Rental of First Blood,Great quality for an older movie we couldn't find anywhere else. My son had been asking to see this movie after he saw the Rocky movies. I am glad we found it here.
1,first blood poor quality,there is nothing HD quality about this in any way. Your better off just gettin the DVD. I looks like they've edited some swearing /gore etc. Very dissapointing!!!!!!!
5,This is not really a 'Rambo' or Stallone film...,"This is still one of my all-time favorites because of the plausible storyline. It is not Stallone blowing away 200 guys with ease and looking cool while doing it. While he wounds several men only one is killed. My only problem with this film was the cheesy flashback scene which, fortunately, only lasted for a minute and sets the movie into high gear. Brian Dennehy is incredible as Sherrif Teasle. I always get into this film from start to finish and still find the end pretty sad. If you think today's action films all have the same plot (none) then you might find this to your liking."
4,Good on Blu-ray,For such and old film this looks good. Good original story for the time. If you haven't seen it Do so.
5,Rambo is great,First Blood is one of the best films ever made. It's got lot's of intense action and Stallone displays some excellent acting talents especially his monologue at the end. It's worth the price of admission just to see that.I highly recommend this film.
4,LG battery,"I bought this battery and liked it very much. It came on time and, disregarding the suspicion that it may not hold the juice for long due to its very reasonable price, it has performed very well so far. The company has done a good job in delivery too."
4,U T makes total sense. We daily overlook nature's gifts.,"The universe keeps gifting us with blessings and we often miss them. Our education or culturization gets in the way. I really think the best things in life are free. The Water of Life by John Armstrong is a beginning, an opening door, that will hopefully change opinions. The cases presented are not only interesting they are convincing. My biggest complaint, is that there are not enough specifics for implementing. e.g. For application to the head/hair. How long should it remain on the hair. Should the hair then be shampooed, or just rinsed?"
3,Hmmmm Interesting concept,"In reality I'm not doin it. If you've got backbone it might work for you, i'm afraid i don't, i'm not up for it."
2,Am I missing something?,"I regularly drink green tea and usually drink Kirkland's bagged green tea made by Ito En. This Yamamotoyama tea is very weak and I am confused why there are such positive reviews. I just made tea with three tea bags in about 12 oz of water and I can barely taste the tea. I've done this a number of times and the result seems to always be the same. I checked the expiration date, and it says my tea is good until 2014. I'm not sure what I'm missing compared to the other reviewers but in my view this is not a good investment and the taste is underwhelming."
5,My Favorite Green Tea,This has become my favorite Green Tea of all. I love it. It's very clean and fresh tasting.
3,Just OK,I enjoy green tea and like trying different varieties. There isn't anything special about this product. The one I like best is actually the Kirkland brand.
4,Just like the sushi bar,"We are happy with the Yamamotoyama tea, and would recommend to others. we like that it comes in bulk package"
5,Excellent Tea,"I drink this almost every day. It smells and tastes like real japanese green tea. It's not matcha exactly, but more like what you would get at a standard restaurant in japan as you would get water in the US. Really enjoy it."
4,A worthy caution,"I think that many of us involved in the technical aspects of ministry are prone to leap headlong into concepts just because 1) it's cool, and 2) we can. This book explores many of the dangers of this process and draws light to the idea that sometimes simpler is better, and it gives valid reasons why. I recommend it as a reality check for any tech minister to consider seriously. Its observations on the pre-worship announcement boards and its effect on the mood of the following worship service are especially insightful."
3,"Interesting title, boring content","I believe this book has some good information regarding technology and worship. However, the way it's written is somehow hard to follow and provides a lot of facts and statistics of technology in worship but no actual tools or examples on how to improve on the use of such technology for worship."
1,boo!,"This game was not fun for me! i personally think that this game was not educational or fun at all, other people may think differently, but do please consider buying a different game, like Zelda, or Harvest Moon (2)"
4,"It's cool, you can play games in color.","I like it because you can play any regular Game Boy game in Color. Also, it's clearer than regular Game Boy. I LLLOOOOVVVEEEE IT!"
4,Pokemon Stadium,"Pokemon stadium is great i dont know why all these people are saying it stinks even my cousin likes it and she doesnt like pokemon so come on people and also if u dont have a gameboy pokemon stadium and that transfer pak comes in handy and also the extra speeds when u beat the prime cup and poke cup, one thing good is that u dont have to take so long to get every where cause they make u go real slow with out faster speeds on gameboy and the gameboy tower(<on pokemon stadium)so i hope u buy pokemon stadium cause it is fun!"
4,Pikachu Rules!,This is any POKeMANIACS dream come true! Great choice for the Poke crazy kid on your list
4,DA BOMB!,"I LOVE IT SO MUCH, THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT ONE SIDE IS YELLOW AND THE OTHER SIDE IS BLUE. EVERYTHING ELSE I LIKE. I THINK YOU SHOULD BY IT BUT NOT IF YOU HAVE BLUE OR RED VERSION. BUT I LLLLOOOOVVVVEEEE IT! BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LOTS OF FUN GOOD LUCK TO TRY TO FIND IT THOUGH.!"
1,Barber King AS17587,"This is a poor product it did not work at all. Don't buy for any reason. I bought it to trim ear hair and when I tried it the cutter just stopped, so the product is a rip off don't waste your money.Mike"
2,Tenderly NOT Particularly Tender,"I was disappointed with the product, primarily because it was ""most ungentle"" when removing hair from the delicate bikini area. I purchased this product because my electric shaver was ""prickly"" and left razor burn. This was no better, though I did appreciate the size and shape; it was quite easy and comfortable to hold--just NOT to USE."
4,Home traction,This cervical traction unit was recommended by my chiropractor for home treatment of bulging discs in my neck. I find it rather uncomfortable to use (I probably could have used it larger but wasn't aware that it came in sizes) but it certainly does the trick. Since I've been using it my neck pain has diminished and I haven't had to have treatments by the doctor.
1,Whaaaaa?,"This book has nothing to do with SATAN! So, why is it in on the HOT NEW SATANISM list?Wake up Amazon!Someone should at least skim these books before listing them."
2,No Peanuts in Shell,"Though the photo shows it and the ingredients list it, the bag of Critter Snack I received has ZERO peanuts in shell in it. And since this is the absolute favorite of my neighborhood squirrels I now feel like I have to buy some other product that includes peanuts in addition to this one. I would really like to depend on getting what is advertised when ordering so not sure I would buy this again. I basically bought a rather expensive bag of corn with a few sunflower seeds in it."
1,disappointed,"I bought this for the squirrels in my yard, but they evidently don't like it. The birds will eat it but it takes several days until it's gone. They all love peanuts, maybe they're just spoiled."
5,Excellent Advice for Any Business,"Let's face it...sooner or later we all have something to sell in business and life, whether it's to help launch a new business, re-energize an existing one or to sell an idea. Elisa's book helps you do it all with great examples, easy-to-digest advice, and lots of passion! You'll want to keep this handy reference around whenever you feel stuck and in need of a fresh perspective on your next sales endeavor."
3,Best Videogame Movie,"We all know that Final Fantasy: TSW, along with Tomb Raider where hyped because they could actually be the first 2 good videogame movies. The truth is, Tomb Raider was Average and no big deal. Now FF, it was pretty good. The story was interesting but at times it got a little bit boring. On the good side, the 3D Graphics are 2nd to none and the animation is incredible. The ending was kind of lame. This IS the best videogame movie to date, it isn't a masterpiece but its good and worth you money. The DVD edition will rock because all of its Special Features. Which will be a must have if you liked the movie."
3,Beautiful on the outside but not on the inside,I had high hopes but ultimately I was disapointed. I am a big fan of the Final Fantasy video games and thought this movie would be awesome. True this is the most asthectically beautiful movie ever made but the dialogue and story is the worst piece of writing ever to have the words Final Fantasy in its title. If anything I think this movie damages the name Final Fantasy. How you can base a movie on a superlative game series and have it come out like it did is beyond me.
2,Its not very good,"I never was able to get into it and so I didn't finish it. Its okay, but not great. Its not like ""Advent Children."""
2,Don't insult it by calling it Final Fantasy! This movie is bad!,"As soon as I started watching, and after realizing it takes place in New York city, which is in OUR world, I knew it would be bad. I was right. It isn't an Anime, let alone Final Fantasy. It's like a computer designed FX movie, which are all pointless and stupid alike. Final Fantasy is one of the greatest Anime series I've ever seen and this is nothing even remotely close. The graphics are probably the most realistic I have ever seen in anything on the planet and look real, but they don't look like the awesome Japanimation I love and that Final Fantasy has. I doubt Squaresoft even oversaw the production of this movie, let alone MADE it, because this is NOT Final Fantasy in any way.Mike Morrison"
1,Snooze Alarm...,"Well, with such a good cast of voice characters, I decided to give this ""cartoon"" a go. Big mistake. Considering I like sci-fi, the story is the worst boring hokey pokey ever. It also reeks of religious overtones. Yuck! It's like a slow death. I found myself begging for it to end. Extremely painful. But if you want a quality cartoon, go see Toy Story and you'll have more fun."
3,You call it a movie?,"O.K. pally, it's definately stunning CGs.....really awesome, worth of all the bucks you paid for it.But what else?Is there any buyable storyline?Characters look like dolls, but are they really acting?Oh, come on, it is supposed to be a movie, and a movie is something more than a bunch of wonderful CGs and special effects.It is really excellent work of tecnology and computer art, but that's all. It is far behind to be a real moive.You may still enjoy the magnificient CG arts and not regret what you paid for it, but yet it can hardly be a movie. It's one good lot of mind-boggling CGs, but nothing more than that."
3,"Awesome, but boresome too!","Beautiful to look at and listen to and very much a landmarkin its own right. Unfortunately, Final Fantasy lacks interestingcharacters or an involving story or a convincing sense of dread,drama, excitement.... In other words, all the classic elements that would have elevated this story to the magnificent heightsof its technical achievment are MISSING.Better luck next time -- and I am sure there will be a next time.Note to creators: skip the video-game expansion and take advantage of some REAL science fiction. It's out there justwaiting for someone smart enough to find it and use it.I understand Ringworld is in the works. Imagine how that wouldhave looked in place of this knock-off of so many other SciFiknock-offs?Want real CGI storytelling? Check out the Roughnecks Chronicles."
1,Final Fantasy just a fantasy for R2 players?,"WARNING: Regional Coding Enhancement (RCE) has been added by Warner and Columbia to certain Region 1 DVD's. FINAL FANTASY IS AFFECTED. RCE will prevent the DVD from playing on some ""Multi-Region"" DVD players. If you are in any doubt that your player may not be able to play RCE DVD's, I recommend that you do not order this title.The film itself is fantastic and the second of the two DVDS is not RCE - but non R1 players will want the film disc to work as well as the docu. disc."
1,The ending bit the dust,"I enjoyed this animation tremendously. The story line was quite captivating. However, the ending left me confused and wondering, "" what were they thinking?"" The story line could have really taken off. I felt cheated and disappointed as I left the theater. I waited with deep anticipation for this movie after seeing the previews. Final Fantasy was the Final Disappointment!"
1,Doesn't feel like Final Fantasy at all...,"Meh... I really didn't like this movie. I didn't care for the story at all, it just felt rushed and stupid. And the characters... They got good actors behind each character, but just the characters themselves were just dumb, there was only maybe one character I actually liked. And, it just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy product at all. It's like a sci-fi movie with ""Final Fantasy"" slapped on the cover, but isn't really FF. Even if it *wasn't* an FF movie, I still wouldn't like it. It was just stupid, seemed rushed, the animation seemed good but that was really the only good part. This movie just... Sucks. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Final Fantasy ... A Let Down,Just like the somewhat popular video game series this movie is terrible. It has an incomprehensible storyline and a non-interesting storyline. The animation is about as good as it comes though. If your looking for a good animated movie check out Princess Mononoke or Akira.
1,"So bad, it ruptured the fabric of both space and time.","This movie had absolutely no plot, none, nada, zip, zilch, zero. I saw it in the theater and seriously contemplated walking out. Yes the graphics were phenomenal, but everything else was just bad. The story was easy to figure out, the dialouge was all cliches, it could have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would not buy this, I would not reccomend it, and last, but not least I would never see it again."
2,final fantasy.x-2 and final fantasy x11,"Hello,I have played all final fantasy games and I think the last two were a big disappointed because the main character Tidus was not in these games.His character was what made final fantasy great.This last game should not be called final fantasy because there are no orignal characters.I hope they will come out with a new final fantasy with Tidus and Yuna.My favorite final fantasy game is ten. Missy"
4,"An excellent movie without the ""Final Fantasy""","I am a huge final fantasy fan, have been since I could get my hands on the games. When I heard a final fantasy movie was being made I was really excited. However this movie is not what you would expect from a final fantasy movie. That being said on to my review:""The spirits within"" is an incredible movie that is amongst my top favirite movies of all times. It has one of the coolest stories about finding hope and survival in a world where all hope has been lost.The best part of the movie is the animation instead of putting real people into a world the would be nearly all CGI they made it all CGI thus making the movie feel like the movie is more realistic.If you can look beyond the fact the the name has final fantasy in it you will find a really great and well made movie. If you can't, well I feel bad that you need a title to make the movie what it is."
3,"Great Movie, Bad Title","Ok, I got the DVD cause all of my friends had said they really anjoyed the movie, and of of course, im also an avid Final Fantasy fan. The movie itself: i would give it 4 stars; a good sci fi thriller and creative storyline. but just one thing. REALLY BAD TITLE! I hate to say. but it has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the final fantasy series. I thought it was more of a cross between Starcraft and Starship Troopers. If they had given it a different name, maybe I would have given a better rating, but next time, lets make the Final Fantasy movie with a little more fantasy to it."
2,FF movie needs little thing called A STORY!!!!!!,"I really like sci-fi, I really like special effects and animation, I really like japanese story telling.But I would much rather watch a good movie with a good story, (like Shawshank Redemption) that had zero special effects than watch a joyless demo reel of CG...If they had put even 10% of the energy they put into realistic skin, towards developing an interesting story they might have had a winner.Instead, what we get is set pieces they want to show off so they try to write some numb-knuckled story that will somehow thread it all together.In the end it fails to register any emotion at all. And with the same money they could have made two or three REAL movies that might have actually told a story.Want to see a good sci-fi story that is lean and well-crafted?... Go watch Gattaca."
3,"Great visuals, lacking a good story","The animation was a ""technical breakthrough"" but the story had NOTHING to do with Final Fantasy. For those that like the games, play the games or are interested in the story in the games, this movie is nothing like it. The film and animation was outstanding, but the story was lacking. There weren't even any chocobos! This is not a story similar to the Final Fantasy games."
3,Tedious,"Let's face it, if your a fan you will give any review of your favourite show/film 4 or 5 stars, no matter how bad, thats the main problem with most Amazon reviews. I really wanted to like Final Fantasy but the fact of the matter is that its great, no make that beautiful, to look at, but sheer torture to sit through. This film is the English Patient (*) of Anime movies. By its end of you wont care a bit if these moody, brooding, sighing characters live or die and (maybe) even cheer when they do. Its the script that killed it not the animation.Anyway, 3 stars for the animation, no stars for the script. And yes I did understand it, that still didnt make it interesting...(*) I loved the English Patient first time round but found it like FF later when showing it to friends, it **is** like they portrayed on Seinfeld, guess you gotta be in the right mood."
4,Is it real or is it Memorex?,"I wasn't sure initially if I was looking at an animation, or real actors. The movie had a very strong fantasy base, and was sometimes hard to follow, but it is worth owning if not for any other reason than it being the first, best example of surrealistic animation. The detail is phenominal, and as I heard someone else say, if I were a member of SAG, I'd think twice before I considered another walkout."
4,90%,"Forget about the story, it wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't great. The story was however a good medium to showcase the incredible animation that went into this film. The animators deserve a high five with the job they did. I'd say that most of the things tackled were at least 90% successful. The texturing of skin, the cloth, the hair, the kinematics, the dynamic forces, ... very believable for the most part. Watch it just for a glimpse of the future. Next time around, expect more emotional content from the characters and a better story."
2,"Great movie, terrible DVD set","Some may argue that the movie was less than average. The fact you are reading this, however, indicates that you liked the movie and are thinking about buying the DVD. Here's what I think about it:Pros:* Rather good quality of audio and video.* Two in-movie commentaries, sadly not by the director.* Certificate of authenticity (I know, it's a piece of paper, but I like it.)Cons:* Disc 2. The scenes here utilize Quicktime 5, is a degradation of the whole DVD idea. These scenes run in a tiny; 3x2 inches window.* Finding mose of the special features is a pain. They are hidden under several layers of menus and sub-menus.* Many of these special features require Internet access, a detail that is not mentioned on the package.* Bonus trailers include trailers of 2-years old movies, such as Starship Troopres.Overall, ignore this DVD and wait for the Extra-special edition or whatever it will be called."
2,"Good animation, dull story.","Although I liked the animation for the most part (some of the skin tones looked inconsistant throughout the film, yet still managed to be terrible every time, some of the non-organic motions were awkward, and other colors were just out of place), the rest of the movie was just plain dull.The story looked like something a B-movie director turned down. Not only was it flat and boring, but it was also quite ridiculous.And this is all ignoring the fact that the movie has nothing to do with the Final Fantasy series. The only thing FFish about the movie were some of the sets, and a few of the character's and their costumes were reminicent of bad guys and footsoldiers from FFVII and VIII.I'm glad I rented this instead of paying money to see it in the theaters, or wasted way too much buying the DVD.The only thing that saved the DVD was one hidden feature. If you have found it, you know what I mean, if you don't know what I mean, find it yourself."
3,WARNING: RCE,"This motion picture will only play on a dedicated Region 1 machine. If you don't know what ""RCE"" or ""Region 1"" mean, then you probably have nothing to worry about."
2,Animation crude and not well thought out,"I was looking forward to renting the DVD of this movie, but what a letdown. The animation is crude and poorly executed. I mean, seriously, what good animator does not know that human beings have tongues, and that without them they cannot speak properly? The eyes, lips and limbs move, the hair looks great, but the faces look like what happened to Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck and Tom and Jerry when the animation work was moved to the Phillipines to save money. FACES HAVE MUSCLES and if they had devoted half the work they put into hair into facial muscles, the animation would have looked halfway convincing. Sorry, but this one doesn't rate more than 2 stars. Toy Story was a much more convincing technical achievement than this.,"
2,should have stick with the original games' stories...,"Because of this unsuccessful movie, Squaresoft went bankrupt and was bought/merged to become Square Enix.I find that Squaresoft should have stick with the original stories of the games. If the games are huge success since the 1st one, they should have stick with the same idea. The 1st Final Fantasy movie should have been on the 1st game.The whole CG animation was well done, but the story didn't attracted the people. It should have been set in a medieval fantasy instead of in an Earth's future.Now, the new management at Square Enix understand the public and will release a movie sequel to Final Fantasy VII's game on DVD: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. It has been a huge success released in ultra tight selected theatres."
2,Idiots,"Idiots made this film. The FF games were all very exciting and if they ever came 2 the big screen it'd be like mixing the Matrix with Lord of the Rings. .....The Idiots who made this film however decided 2 base the story on something other than the games. Theres no fighting in the movie. They shoot, but its useless shooting. I guess u'd have 2 watch it to see what I mean. It looks great, and after a while into it u'll almost forget that you're watching computer animations. But that doesn't save the movie... not at all. Quite frankly, if you've never played or seen someone play the games, then u MIGHT be able to bear through it. Any fans of the games will HATE it. The creators lost alot of money on this film. But they brought it on themselves."
2,way to ambitious,"they should have kept it a ""space special forces fights aliens theme"" not a ""space soldiers fight alien ghosts"". And how did those guns with the regular bullets with shell casings and all effect ghosts? Plus you'd think that far in the future we would have more advanced weaponry. They were carrying knives for god sake, lets cut the ghosts throat i guess!! I was let down a little."
1,When will Hollywood learn?,"Enough of these terrible film addaptions, already! First Tomb Raider now this...""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is my pick for the worst video game addapted for the big screen ever. Where's the Fantasy, exactly (and I quote ""It is not Fantasy, it is true"")? It takes place in New York, there's no use of magic at all, no guardians (or aeons, as they're now called), and none of the FF series's trademark cinematography (eg. the contrast between sunny and dark atmospheres). The characters are boring and flat, it's far too long, and it's plot is needlessly complicated. And (this is the last of my complaining, I promise) there is absolutely no comedy in it, exept for how terrible it is, and even then, it's really more of a sad thing..."
1,Could've Been So Much Better!,"I never played any of the FF games, but the movie looked really cool because of the animation. That's about all that I liked. The plot idea was great and could've taken off, but nothing was developed. They didn't explain anything to you. Also, the characters were not developed. They killed them all off anyways. This could be redone to make a really exciting movie."
1,Beautiful to look at,"This movie is beautiful to look at and that's where it ends. Plot is sooooooo boring it puts you to sleep, movie is just way, way, way to slow. If you have trouble sleeping this movie will cure your sleeping problems for sure."
2,"Great potential, poor execution","I was tempted to buy this movie because I want to support computer animation as it develops out of its infancy. But I decided to rent Final Fantasy first after losing $25 bucks on Titan A.E.From a technical perspective, the film film is hit and miss. Group shots and anything shown from a distance work very well. Backrounds and ships also worked. Close ups of characters rarely worked, though some were better than others. It was obvious some characters (the old scientist) were paid more attention to.From a story standpoint, it was pure goofy anime. I consider myself a typical American viewer, and I will tell anyone interested that I think ships that look like big animals or any other animal related themes like the spirits in this film are just plain old silly.Computer animated movies would have a much better chance of mass popularity if their makers could license a known actor to ""star"" - my choice would be Bruce Lee."
4,Sci-fi special effects at their finest,"If you're looking at this movie thinking it will tie in to any of the Final Fantasy video games than you are going to be dissapointed. This is a completely different story with new people and places. That doesn't mean it's not a great story though, because it is!The world Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within takes us to the future where the planet is mostly devoid of life, and the few surviving humans are holed up at a shielded city. The planet has been overrun with semi-transparent demon beasts. The only hope for the future of humanity is with a few scientists trying to find a way to fight the creatures.With state-of-the-art special effects, this film is completely computer generated. Overall, this is fantastic film, and desereves a look. I highly reccomend this movie!"
3,lifeless,"i know this is a computer animated movie, but that doesnt mean the characters have to be as lifeless as its Creator, the computer. i give it three stars for the effort involved in creating such graphics. that must have taken some time!"
3,"You know, for just a minute . . .",". . . I thought something was wrong with the signal, because I just happened on this thing without reading about it and thought the people were real! The movie? Oh well, I can take or leave this sort of thing, it was OK I guess.What struck me about this is how close we're getting to reality in animations. Ten more years and we won't need actors and actresses anymore, they'll just sell their images and voices! Or their heirs will, I suppose. Would you bother to pay to acquire the real 60 year-old Robert Redford when you can rent his age 30 images? The further adventures of Indiana Jones with Harrison Ford at 35? Co-starring Mary Pickford? Why not? Anyway, definitely worth a look-see just to check on the current state of the art in human animation."
5,groundbreaking,This film looks and sounds simply astonishing.After a while you almost forget you're watching a totally CGI film because the characters are so lifelike.Great stuff.
5,Exciting!,"Terrific visual effect and fantastic atmosphere,with powerful music accompanied, this DVD is worth to buy! Great enjoyment of hearing and vision."
3,For the hardcore only,"Final Fantasy has always been about story and graphics. It is sad to see such a brilliant (and long in the making) effort fall short on the story. Unless you are a hardcore enthusiast, I'd recommend renting this title. The scenery is beautiful and matches toe to toe with Final Fantasy X's cut-scenes, but you're apt to be bored 20 minutes into the movie. The 2 disc DVD contains some great bonus material, such as, alternate opening sequence, making, and a way to edit scenes and paste them together. All things being equal, which is never the case, give this a spin from your video store...unless you are a die-hard..."
4,Very Good performances by all,"On an earth over taken by mysterious alien beings the remainers of humanity. The scientists and the military are divided into opposite camps over what to do in this situation.Overal-It is a great film, if it had followed the game in the slightest it would get five stars, still it is a very good movie especally by Alec Baldwin."
5,Lager than life!,"Just superb,many others have said it befor me, so yes the product ended superbly, when you see the countless hours of computation that was necesary to produce this film, ("
3,Amazing,The digital animation is this science fiction adventure film is simply amazing. The characters seems eeriely real and the enviroments are stunningly realized. The story is surprisingly spiritual for an action picture. I saw in the theater and if the DVD contains plenty of extras it should be worth buying
3,Visual candy hindered acting and animation.,"This movie was a technical feat, make no doubt about it. But it is clear that the acting and facial animation needs a lot of work before this technology really comes of age.The movement of the characters were motion captured (using real people to digitally ""capture"" their motions), yet the facial movements and --worst of all-- their speech were stiff and unconvincing. You can look at stills of the film and say ""wow, that's real!"" but as soon as they start talking you know they are still traditionally animated digital creattions.Of course, it is only time before Pixar/Disney or PDI take the technology another step to really knock our socks off!!"
3,"A breakthrough in visual arts, an ok movie","No, the world is not ready to replace actors. Final Fantasy shows that we've come a long way in visual effects. It is visually stunning with completely digital sets, creatures, props, etc. And while the ""cast"" looks amazing, it shows that we still have a way to go. The secret to enjoying this film is to not directly watch the characters lips, which becomes distracting due to lip synch problems. The story itself seems simplistic and is overshadowed by the effects. But that didn't keep me from enjoying it."
3,Fantastic looking dross.,"It's so unfortunate that the highly accomplished computer graphics have been complimented with a story totally bereft of any attempt at originality or interest.I've never seen the Final Fantasy games so there's no issue with any failings with respect to them, but considering how much this film must have cost and the obvious care and attention lavished on the visuals, better writing should have been factored in.Overall, a Saturday morning animation would rate as highly."
3,Good movie though not Final Fantasy,"The animation is great, and the story line is okay, but this isn't Final Fantasy. Die hard Final Fantasy fans will be highly dissapointed with the lack of any actual reference to anything in the popular RPG's. The only consistant thing is CID, but other than that it's completely different. There isn't one spell cast, no potions, and no Pheonix Downs. The monsters were basically all the same thing, some form of evil spirit. Where's the Flan? or the Bohemoth? At least give me one Ochu. Not a bad fantasy but certainly no Final Fantasy."
3,Very realistic,The plot is very thin. It is about these phantoms that have invaded the earth and the attenpt to get rid of them. It is based on the video game of the same name. The real star of the movie is the animation. The characters are almost real. It is very hard to distinquish between these characters and real humans. Final fantasy is the most realistic computer animation movie to date.
2,Okie Dokie,"The movie was entertaining for the moment, but in my opinion the entire Final Fantasy feel was lost, i expected better. Where did all the cool hair and outfits go? I recomend the games Final Fantasy 7 through 10 over the movie. In short, it could have been better."
2,Bad Plot,"This movie is sorely disappointing. The show is talking about some aliens spirit creating havoc and destroying people life and how the heros in the movie going to save this world. This is one of the worst plot I have ever come across. Maybe they are not interested in telling a story but more interested in showing off their CGI. No doubt the CGI is great, but the movie should be at least have some substances. Why not follow story in the PS games? At least it is more fantasy than this. But luckily, the dvd is a gem. It contains many goodies that might worth seeing."
3,Great DVD... Unless you have a reigon free player.,Its a great movie with amazing CGI but if you have a reigon free player it wont play. I was very disapointed to find this out.
4,"Donald Sutherland, James Woods RUINS this film...","Whose voice is Dr. Aki Ross? I don't know but that's fine. But using Hollywood actors' voices with different bodies is perverse. Someone has to call an end to this common practice that ruins animation films. Aki is Ming-Na? That means what to me? PEOPLE! If you want to animate Southerland and Woods then do that. But putting their voices in the wrong bodies is a Hollywood sickness that shouts a mentality that ""Nobody would go see a cartoon unless we used Sylvester Stalone's voice.""So why didn't they use Cher for Aki Ross? Or Courtney Love? (gag me).I advise setting up the DVD to French and the subtitles to English. Then you can enjoy the film without the ""name actor's"" bagage. Really. Just say NO! to this nonsense.Of course the film is marvelous. But that is a different issue. Happy New Year!"
2,Why?,"This has nothing to do with Final Fantasy. Better off getting the Japanimation DVDs.. I mean, there are no Chocobos or familiar background music in the movie or anything.. I wasted some HARDCORE cash on this one at the movie theater. I give it 2 stars because yeah, the graphics rock. What can I say? But as far as being worthy enough to bear the title of Final Fantasy, hah. Try again buddy..."
2,Definitely a gamers' movie,"Beautiful colors and brilliant animation with excellent voicings.That's it. That's about all you can say about this rewarmed pot-boiler. Hackneyed plot, nonexistent character development, unsatisfying conclusion.This is a film that will appeal to gamers and fans of anime. Everyone else can find better use for their ticket money."
1,"Fantastic animation for the time, terrible story","All the tricks in the world can't save a poorly conceived and told story. Dialogue is stilted, and the story truly stumbles all over itself. And of course, with time, even the animation is looking weak these days. It rightfully drove the division that created it out of business."
2,terrible,"this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinion"
3,Nothing too spectacular,"At first, I thought this movie was going to be a flop no better than Tomb Raider, Doom, or any other video game to movie project. Although this movie met my expecations, it did not beat them by much.Even today, some of the graphics in the movie are quite amazing and certain characters look very life-like. Although, you are easily taken out of the world of the movie when you look at the other, not even close to realistic characters. The most disappointing is the main character herself who seems to have pasty hair and plastic skin. In addition, there's only so much the graphics can do since the story of the movie is based on phantoms and such and takes place in the distant future.The story itself is very average. Though better than your basic plot, it is still quite pratictable and does feel very much like a video game at times.In all, this movie may be worth renting from the video store, but I'd think twice before adding it to your collection."
3,Aki Ross Needs Braces,"All of the characters have a strange over bite and walk around with their mouths open. This movie is a step forward for computer special effects. However, the ""over bite"" situation becomes annoying after awhile. Plus the story could have been better."
1,Awful,I just watched this movie and I have to say I am sorry I wasted an hour and 45 min. I started watching it because it looked so real. Once I started I wanted to see what was going to happen. When it was over I was soooo mad I watched it. I give this movie 1 star just for the animation.
1,Worst transfer in the history of movies...,"There's no excuse for a transfer this bad on a movie where all the imagery is computer generated. Where the hell is all the grain coming from? It's so bad it looks like there's a neverending sandstorm layered over the top of the entire movie. Did they copy the Blu-ray version of the movie from a film print or what? If you want to see how clean a CG movie on Blu-ray should look, check out Happily N'Ever After... and then compare it to this."
2,Pretty bad...,"...all I'm saying, though, is that it would have been much improved if, at some point when they were on the planet, the following exchange had taken place:Black guy: Smells like chocobos!Female lead: Let's try using this carrot.Male lead: Oh! The big chocobo!Background music: bom bombom bombom, bombom bom bom."
2,Why great technology does not equal great film.,"Being an avid film viewer, I have seen many a movie. I own 150+ plus DVD's and go to the theaters as much as possible. When I went to this highly anticipated film (at least by me and my brother), I was suprised to find it not so great (to say the least). Sure the CG is fantastic and the production values are spectacular, but does that make up for a confused cliched script and emotionally hollow voice acting? I think not. If you wish to see great CG and a great movie, watch Toy Story or The Abyss. When watching those movies in a theater or on a 8 inch black and white TV, they will still make great film.When reading other reviews on this site, keep in mind that the people giving 5 stars to movies like these are essentially claiming that this film is as good as other _truly deserving_ 5 star films. Is ""The Spirits Within"" as good of a film as Star Wars or The Matrix? Ponder this when you watch this movie."
2,Good animation but bad acting and awful plot.,"This video game turn movie needs a lot of retooling and better storylines. I see Shrek and that was a 100 times better. This movie no doubt spoiled the other video game turned movies. I just don't like it. The action wasn't that bad, however it could make it more interesting."
3,Mediocre,"I first saw the movie in theaters on the day of its release. But it quite didn't live up to expectations. The movie started out good, but the last twenty minutes totally ruined it for me. The ending was a total letdown... even though the earth was saved, Aki's lover dies and for really no reason (although it had to do with the ""gaia needed another life"" or something like that). It's worth a viewing (especially for its awesome, lifelike CGI graphics), but I don't know if it's a keeper."
4,Great animation and an intriguing storyline,"Ok, I just watched Final Fantasy for the second time, and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. From the trailers that were originally promoting the film I sort of expected a slam-bam action film and so was a bit disappointed the first time I saw it, I thought too much dialogue and a plot that had been spliced from various anime. But on second viewing, knowing what to expect I found it to be a much more enjoyable movie. The animation as has been said countless times, is nothing short of amazing, the characters are fairly well fleshed-out (no pun intended) and it has an interesting storyline. The little extra with the characters dancing to Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" is hilarious too. All in all, an enjoyable movie that's definitely worth the time to see, there's times you'll be watching and even forget that these aren't real actors, as a matter of fact they act better than some of the so-called superstar actors out there today!"
3,Amazing computer graphics but the storyline could be better,If you're into good sci-fi computer graphics this would be it although the story could have been done a little better. It tends to get a little bit confusing on how the ghosts can really take human souls even though this is not a horror movie and these things were military aliens not devils.
2,Horrible screenplay brought to life with beauty,"Hopefully this will be SquareSofts last movie, they should provide special effects for other movie houses, but should not produce any more stand alone movies, they are no Pixar.What's wrong? Well, the movie is boring and rather dark, it's CGI is amazing and the only saving grace here. It would have also been really nice if Square would have tied into the popular video game series instead of just using it's brand name with no plot tie-ins or relation to the game, it just plan disapoints FF fansTwo whole stars because the DVD is featured."
4,It Rocks!,I really liked this movie. Of course it could be better if there was some familiar characters in it but nothing's perfect. the graphics are really good and it is an interesting storyline. I advise you to watch this movie.By Holly Hudson:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
2,Impressive Animation....but thats it.,"The most impressive thing about this film is the quality in animation. Unfortunately, films that just have good look will fail. What I mean is... The story was too linear and predictable. When you watch the movie, you know whos evil, you know whos gonna die, and you know whos gonna fall in love.Bottom line: Its worth seeing once, but prepare for a bland experience from the so called ""Masters of all things RPG"""
3,"Well, the animation was great...","The selling point of this film was it's amazingly real animated people, and there are times you forget your watching a computer generated scene. Sadly, the story behind the movie is poor at best. It seems to have been unabashidly written by members of the green party, mixing ""mother earth"" enviro-speak into a pseudo-religion background, than cranked to ""beat you over the head"" volume. It's unfortuanate, as the characters seem to have at least reasonable deapth, and the rest of the story has some potential. I can only wish it had been givin a chance to use it. Everyone should at least see this film for the graphics, but know what your getting into."
4,Future phantom fiction film,"When I watched Final Fantasy , I knew why my brother liked it. The only thing I was disapointed with was that the comic relief, Neil was killed off. The thing that upsets me is that the directors are upsessed with Aki's hair movement.The CG is good and the phantom design is great. It needs more shooting and less talking. The plot takes some time to figure out but once you do it all comes together. The way that the phantoms kill people makes you think why the soldiers need those big space suits. Overall the tital probably has nothing to do with the games For PS and PS2 but the movie itself would make a good game. For those of you who don't read the credits of movies you would have noticed the number of Japanese people who worked on this film. Unfourtunelty not the best thing to come out of japen since Godzilla (Im a G fan myself) But still worth your time watching it."
2,A LOST FANTASY,"This movie is an outstanding example of what digital technology can achieve visually. For this, it deserves 2 stars.What a pity, however, that so much tecnical effort distracted the makers and made them forget the importance of a good plot.This is truly a lost opportunity, an anti-statement in sci-fi.Maybe next time the combination of this tecnicians with the ideas provided in the stories of people like Bradbury, Henlein, Asimov, will achieve the final fantasy: a digital masterpiece that will score as Blade Runner did in its time........"
4,"Good graphics, simple story","The work on graphics is worth to watch the movie. Some times you'll do mistake a CG character for a flesh-and-bones person.The story is simple, but it gives you room for a couple of exciting scenes. I would call it a ""light"" movie, not to laugh, cry, or think too much (or at all). While watching the movie you might remember Ghostbusters, Terminator, X-men or even some news about military decisions, but much, much lighter.If you liked that movies or like harder things, better look for another option for the weekend."
3,Doesnt really do the games justice,"Ive played Final Fantasy 7,8 and 10 and thought they were cool. Thinkin the movie was going to be like the games, i rented it. The earth being alive and having a spirit and all that stuff was totaly from final fantasy 7. The story was ok, but could have been WAY better. The alien ghost thing was good as well were the dream parts.it would have been better if there was like a maine bad guy who was doing all of the stuff to the earth and they had to fight him. And the Aki character had not emotion in her voice at times. YEt besides all that, the movie was good. It needs a 2nd one thats more like the FF games though."
2,Ugh,"3 stars for graphics1 star for ""plot""Basically, the graphics are wonderful. The fact that they can mimic human skin with imperfections is awe-inspiring. This movie is eye-candy.However, if you're looking for a logical, realistic story, you'll scratch your head by the time the credits roll."
2,Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within (Special Edition),"I liked it. If you're not a fan of sci-fi, then this will be too big of a leap. Weak storyline, scattered about the film as you learn bits and pieces, it tries to offer up clues and information in a stylized manner, but fails in it's attempt. Still a good choice for a sci-fi junky."
3,What have you done to final fantsy?!?!,"Okay this movies a must see but if you want to buy it get the DvD it has some very cool stuff on it's 2 disc set,but one thing I did not like about the movie is...its just not Final Fantasy..no Chocobo's,Moogles etc.. theres not even magic in this movie. Just think of this movie as FF8 with no magic chocobos or moogles. But dont worry more than likely (if you are a die hard fan) you will love this film the dvd's well done and if you like the final fantasy games you will not wanna miss this dvd."
2,The VHS version should be enough.,"If we talk about the movie, it's the kind of movie you have to see a couple of times.But talking about the DVD the story is completly different. I rented this DVD mainly because of the extras, but I think it was a steal. All you get to see is a bunch of animatics, animatics and more animatics. Even the ""outtakes"" are animatics. You won't learn anything from the extras even if you know too much about animation and compositing since there are no ""documentaries"" at all, just a lot of images with some background music.If you want the DVD because of the movie, then get it. DVD quality is far better than VHS quality, you can do whatever you want with the Disc Two, since it's basically useless."
2,Great effects Yawning Story Line,"The wonderous awe of computer animated humans and effects were beyond fantastic, but failed to keep me from fighting sleep. The story line was predictable and I still wonder what it had to do with the computer game series of the same name. The voices of Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland had about as much feeling and depth as footprint on a tile floor. I found the interactive documentary and DVD ROM features much more entertaining. Save your money and rent; it or better yet wait for it to hit HBO."
3,"Generic, somewhat bland, but still entertaining","I never really wanted to watch this movie so I guess I was pretty impressed with that fact that it wasn't extremely boring. It was somewhat interesting. It kept me entertained. It was an ok movie. Just OK. I think the plot of it is so generic that it offends people. The people I saw this movie with (they wanted to see it, not me) did not like it at all. So what does this all mean? Well, if you are looking for a mediocre sci-fi adventure to kill time, this could be what you're looking for. But please, let me say once more, this is not a bad movie, or a good movie. It is just an OK movie."
1,great movie.. for people with NO STANDARDS!,"great movie.. absoloutly SUPERB MOVIE!oh wait.. i meant to say ""graphics"" not ""movie"".he movie was absolute TRASH.. no plot whatsoever, poor ""acting"", and i think some of the lip synching was off...but, anyways, back to the point: this movie was great, if you are deaf and can't read subtitles. if the rating was only based on the visuals and complexity of the graphics, this movie would get 5+ out of 5, but since it also has to take ""acting,"" and plot into account, this movie [is terrible]. [why do you think the company who created the film filed for bankrupcy recently?]the most amazing part of the movie was to be able to create very realistic human hair and human figures, and beautiful other visuals.. everything else falls apart and ruins the film. i you are a fan of the games, do NOT watch this movie, unless you want a reason to disown the games as an act of disgust for the name ""Final Fantasy.""..."
2,"Incredible Graphics, No Plot","The 2 stars that I rated this movie come only from the phenominal computer graphics. They are absolutely amazing. The rest of the movie, however is lacking. With very little plot, this movie is tough to get through, and is almost unwatchable the second time around. Unless all you want is to be dazzled by fantastic computer imagery, stay away."
3,Well..,"I liked it more than most, but the plot is a bit weak. The graphics are absolutely incredible though, still some of the best CGI around."
4,Fangirls honest review,"Some of the characters aren't developed as well as I'd liked them to have been. They focus on some superfluous things, and could have really ramped up the interest by removing the focus from those things (to which I wont mention and spoil), and focused more on some character development and character interaction development.Voice acting was pretty decent, animation was good for the time it was created. Story is pretty cliché, ending is typical for anime. The first time I watched it, when I was fourteen or so, and I thought it was pretty bawler. I feel it's appropriate for children 8+, simply because if they're any younger they wont understand what's going on. Given how brain-dead/scatter brained the youth of America is these days, I'd have to say 11+ instead.Overall, it was entertaining and I'm a fangirl of FF, so 4 stars... even though it deserves more like 3."
2,What were they thinking,"The only reason I give this movie 2 stars is because it was pretty. Once the eye-candy, ""wow that looks great, I'm shocked,"" wears off you have to look at the movie for what it is: A super trite and boring plot that makes you want to use the DVD as a frisbe. See it for the eye-candy, buy it because you always wanted to see how far a DVD could travel."
3,Story within?,"This movie had great CGI, but the story falls a little short. The vocal talents were excellently cast. I enjoyed watching all the artwork, but the story could have been less abstract. Basically space ghosts come crashing to Earth and kill most of the population.There is a conflict between the scientists and the military as to how to rid the planet of the space ghosts. The scientists wanted to track down different sprits and combine their sprit waves. What ever!! Why couldn't they just synthesize the stupid wave?Over all a so so movie. The DVD had a lot of extras. Sorry to say it did not have a lot in the way of cast interviews."
2,All grain is all pain.,"Back when The Spirits Within was released in 2001, the makers added fine artificial grain to give this CGI title a filmlike look. In my humble opinion that was a terrible choice at trying to make an otherwise beautiful CGI movie into something it is not.When the title was released to DVD, the significant reduction in picture resolution virtually eliminated this artificial grain.Blu-Ray does however offer a much better resolution than DVD and this also means it reproduces the grain, much to my annoyance.I would have given this title two stars for story and two stars for visuals, but the grain makes it seems like a high resolution analog release, so I am going to leave out the visual stars.Once again, I realise this is not a flaw in the transfer, but a flaw in the original cinematic production. But none the less, it shows."
3,This movie Lacks,"This movie lacks the storyline of the game. When I first saw the movie I had never played the game, when I did play the game and watched the movie again I found out that the movie had nothing to do with the game. The movie released in 2001 bombed at the box office because it cost 137 million to make, which I don't know why. This movie is worth a watch but if you're a fan of the game you will not like this movie."
1,The worst movie i've ever seen,"I don't think this movie should have been called Final Fantasy because it was nothing like it. i was very excited when it came out, but after i saw it i was very disapointed. I heard there is another Final Fantasy movie coming out but it's actually the sequel to Final Fantasy seven. Hopefully that one will be much better than this one is and actually have something to do with Final Fantasy."
2,This shouldn't have been called Final Fantasy.,"I like Final Fantasy, but this wasn't it. It should have been called ""Sci-Fi Spirits"" or something. :) No characters or villians from the games. No magic or fights. At the start of this movie you think you might be watching a CGI version of Aliens (which would have been better than this). The CGI is nice, but rest was convolted garbage."
3,Super Graphics,"I was so excited to see this movie in the theatres, even though the story line was weak. The computer generated scenes in this movie are out of this world. The characters are so life like that it is scary. The best thing to come out of this movie is the hope that one day we will not need 20 million dollar actors, we will have computer generated actors."
3,pretty to look at.........,"Computer rendering has truly come a long way and Final Fantasy is a milestone. I have watched the movie with the sound off several times just too watch the colors and textures. The acting, well left me cold. Let's face it a guy in front of a computer screen is not the same as a actor in front of a movie screen. Subtle nuances is what was lacking. I remember a Saturday cartoon called Tarzan. When he climbed up a tree it looked totally believable. I found out later that they had shot on video of a stunt man climbing scaffolding and they copied that. I wish they had studied the actors faces like that.I would say something about the script but there really isn't much to say. Anyway, this is still a decent movie not a great movie. Rent it before you buy it."
2,"D. Hauck, Michigan",What I did not like: The directions said that I needed to water proof the seams else they would leak because of the stitching: why did not the manufactor do this? On initial setup: One of sections of poles had a small dent that did not allow me to in sert the other pole in it; one of the sections of poles had been scraped and had rust on it and 1 1/2 inches of screening had come loose from the center strip. I can live with and or fix these items but I'm not so pleased.What I did like: I received it in a timely fashison it was easy to put up by myself. I liked the storage case that came with it. It meets my basic needs.
1,Junk...cheap..stay away!!!,This is a piece of garbage...the screens were torn in multiple places right out of the box...we needed it for the weekend so we stitched it up...you get what you pay for...and this is junk..too much p.i.a to send it back....beware!!
4,Camping Haven,"I purchased this screen room to take camping. Set up was really quick, but takes two people. I was just a little disappointed that the lower edge didn't quite come to the ground, and no way to adjust the height so that it could be lowered. Overall, it is a good purchase and we use it each time we camp. Have decided that if we want the lower edge to touch ground, we need to set it up in taller grass."
1,tent,"i didn't order tent in oct. i bought one earlyer in the year , the order was doubled so i sent it back"
1,Texsport Westview Screen Arbor,This item is without a doubt the worst waste of money in my life. I threw it into the trash. I rate it no stars.
2,just cheap screen house,"pro : cheap, easy assembly, looks like waterproofcons : cheap material, some pole doesn't fit, big meshBefore this screen house, I got 14 by 12 screen house at Sams club by swissgear which was very good, well made and good price. I felt it was to big for us and returned it. The second one was by greatland at nearby target store. The quality was much poor than the swissgear's. Finally,I looked at the reviewes here and bought this one. I was happy about the cheap price. The pole looks likes steel which is easily get rust and some of them I cannot plug it in. I tried to bent them and manage to fit in. The screen mesh is lage compared to ordinary mesh of any tent. The roof material is same thing as a tarp and look like water proof which is good thing. The carring bag is big and nice. In my point of view, this is just a cheap screen house not better worthy than the money. You cannot expect quality of coleman or Eureka for sure."
1,It didn't even last for two months!,"I ordered this screen arbor June 18, 2009 to go around a kiddie pool for my child to protect against bugs and to provide shade.It was easy to assemble and looked nice.Not even two months later three of the ropes that tied down the tent to stakes needed replaced as they had snapped, one of the top panels has fallen apart (I am assuming the ""sun rot"" I have been reading about in other reviews), and the corners where the metal pieces you tie the tie downs to are attached are coming apart from the tent.A poor quality waste of money!"
3,Nice Arbor for the Price,"It took four of us to assemble this arbor. It wasn't difficult, however, the poles easily came out of their support brackets. You need a person at all four points of assembly for the cover. Be careful not to rip the cover, it's thin. The instructions are useless. The directions indicate the cover may leak through the seams and should be sprayed with a waterproofer sold at camping stores. They supply plenty of ground stakes and rope. The carry bag is nice and it is packaged well. If you're taking it camping, practice assembly at home."
4,Very Nice Screen Arbor,Easy to assemble. Could be set up by one person although easier with two.Relatively sturdy. Certainly helped us to enjoy bug free dinning on our last camping trip.
4,Good for the price!,The tent went up extremely easy; put it up alone and had no problems. Took around 45 mins. to assemble. Plenty of anchor points keep it tightly in place during windy days. Has a zippered opening on front and back so you can enter either way. The materials are a little cheap and I expect it to only last for 1 or 2 years. Makes a nice shelter for my patio table to keep the mosquitos and black flys out. Works well for an easy quick fix for the summmer!A quick update! It's now 8/27 and my tent is basically useless. The whole front roof of the tent sun rotted at the seams and fallen in. If you're going get this tent don't leave it in the sun for the season it will not last. And this has been an extremely rainy year here in NH. It's cheap in price and cheap in quality. If I could I would change my rating to 2 stars instead of the initial 4!
5,Listen to this song!,"If there's anything I can say....buy this album.....it's just the coolest Bon Jovi song yet. If you're looking for a bit of inspiration to keep you going, this is it!!!!"
1,Bad quality,The cartridge only lasted after 2 sheets of paper. They are cheap quality: Very sketchy product.
5,delicious hazelnut chocolate,"This is one of my favorite chocolate from Kinder Bueno. It use to be my top favorite, but there is also the Happy Hippo from Kinder which is so very good. Also a must try.Kinder Bueno: each stick has four chambers, the outside is a wafer type material, while the inside is filled with hazelnut chocolate. There are 2 sticks per package. It is addictive. Some people say that one stick is enough. But there are days when I can eat 3 or 4 of them.I absolutely love hazelnut chocolate. When I'm dieting, this is one of the few chocolates that I would eat.. since I believe in saving calories for the best."
5,Addictive and Creamy,"A friend of ours brought these home from Europe for my husband and I. I don't know why they aren't sold more in the US, but it's worth the hassle to order them online. We have found that it's better to try to order them in the fall or winter, becasue the batch we ordered this summer got a little melty."
3,Too sweet,Lots of reviews have stated that it's not too sweet but it's still a little too sweet for my tastes. I prefer dark chocolate over chocolate but i can still handle the sweetness of milk chocolate and this was just too much for me. I prefer kit kats over this.
5,Delicious!,This was delicious! I'd order it again. I love the way it is packaged; so easy to open. It arrived quickly and damage-free.
4,Good Stuff,"Everyone should try these chocolates and share them! I only gave it 4 stars because I normally don't eat candy, but I'll never turn these down. My entire family goes crazy when they see I have these in the house. They make great gifts because you can't just run to the store and pick them up.(YET) They're a real treat! Try them!"
3,Are these ruins really inhabited?,"Having first seen this book poking out of someone's shopping bag whilst in hospital, I was intrigued by its title.It's essentially a work based on the common realisation that nothing is exactly as it would first seem. If you can't judge a book by its cover, then you certainly shouldn't judge Muriel Beadle by her work.She is a writer from the traditional school of modern ethical query, which creates a dichotomy between the existential relationship of the 'id' and the more problematic 'ego'.All in all, a rollicking good read."
4,Love it,"Pretty cool ornament. Depending on the air-flow, it cycles every 10 to 20 seconds so the motion isn't too distracting. I would have given it 5 stars but the connector at the end of the tube came off. I repaired it with a little silicone."
4,I like it,"I've owned this ornament for over 2 years now and it still looks great in my aquarium. Its really lightweight so you need to put a lot of pebbles on its lower base to keep it from floating up to the top of the tank. If you buy this, you should also buy a value. Before I bought a value to use with this, the jug would stay up all of the time since there was nonstop bubbles coming out. My fish like this ornament too. One of my smaller fish actually stay inside of the skeletons ribcage most of the time."
1,Terrible item,"I bought this expecting much more. The bubles are not as described, they are massive and it sounds like minor explosions in my tank. And it barely moves at all, it jiggles back and forth. Do not waste your time and money on this"
4,GREAT MYSTERY!!!!!,"This is a very good murder mystery with a great cast. The Alpha DVD leaves something to be desired, though. While the picture quality is actually quite good, the splices get very annoying after a while. The breaks in dialogue are especially frustrating. The print, however, has the tinted sequences. This film deserves to at least be patched together from various prints to make a good whole."
2,Interesting mystery nearly ruined by David Manners,"This has the potential to be a fun Hollywood murder mystery. Unfortuntately, David Manners as the lead is terribly annoying and ruins every scene he's in. But there are a few twists, and I WAS surprised by the killers' identity.This movie's only real appeal to movie fans lies in the presence of Bela Lugosi, but his role is very, very small and doesn't give him anything interesting to do. His Dracula costar Edward Van Sloan fairs a little better in a more featured role.The DVD of this film didn't do anything to try to clean it up, though it actually looks a little better than some of Lugosi's Poverty Row flicks. But I don't recommend this as a purchase, even at the cheap price; Lugosi fans will be disappointed."
1,A rehash of SMIT,"Unfortunately, this book adds no insight into using or configuring AIX. A large portion of the pages are covered with screen shots of various SMIT screens (the AIX administration tool) and the text surrounding these screen shots does not provide any meaningfull insight.I've spent a considerable amount of time with this book and have put it away permanently in favor of The AIX Survival Guide."
1,An awful book. Read the SMIT panels instead.,This book is *not* for the seasoned admin. The topics covered are quite base and new AIX folks can merely hit the <F1> button in the SMIT panel to get the very same explanation that the book regurgitates.I implore you to not waste your money on this book. It tells the reader nothing new and gives no insight to the wonders of AIX. I think this is the worst AIX book out there. There has to be one and this is it.I would give it zero stars if I could.
3,"Good Price and package, needs improvement","The skin fits nicely but is not well thought out. The bottom slot is too small and doesn't allow the sync adapter to fully insert, but its easily remedied with an Xacto knife. The center slot for the touch pad is also too narrow - it allows for all touch pad operation, but is too tight on the next\previous buttons, They are almost impossible to press - another Xacto knife solution. The screen prtoector does not fit very tightly. Otherwise the skin is pretty durable and fits just right.The adapaters still require the use of the sync cradle."
4,vision m skin,"the was a pretty decent skin, it very nice to know that i can find something that doesnt have anything to do with the ipod and still high quality."
3,Be Certain B4 You Buy,I knew when I read the reviews that the skin might not be good and they were right. The one I received did not even have an opening for the touch pad on the Zen. It looked like it was not even meant for a Zen so I threw it away since I did not want to pay to ship it back. So far the chargers are fine.
4,A Very good collection,"I thought the 4 selections from the group's first line-up were OK, especially ""Island,"" but, given that this band is remembered for its SECOND line-up, I didn't understand why they were included. Nevertheless, this is a solid compilation CD. Generally, there are 2 songs from each of the albums. I'm glad I got this double-CD."
1,"So bad, it's a wonder it's not a cult movie!","I couldn't agree with the previous reviewer more--it's hard to believe that this movie could possibly have been made as a serious ""action"" flick. Right from the start, with the lead terrorist consulting his map of the building time after time after time, I assumed that the entire movie was a spoof! I'm still not quite convinced it 's not a tongue-in-cheek affair... I've watched it twice now with my husband, and we've thoroughly enjoyed creating our own running dialogue to accompany the movie and which points out all the things the characters overlook/do wrong/do poorly/don't do and should."
4,Half-Read but All Great.,"I had to purchase this book for an English class where we discuss how we can use videogames to produce fiction, and also how to produce a videogame that is fiction, as well as how the two relate. From what we have covered so far it has really sparked my interest to pursue other literature in this category. Jesper Juul does a great job putting his thoughts out there, and it's been a great read so far."
4,Good read about games,"This is an interesting read for anyone who wants a perspective about games and gaming from someone who isn't a typical ""fanboy"" or ""industry geek."" Some of the insights were a bit typical for what you might expect, but there were a few nuggets that showed that Juul actually took some time to think about the genre and how rules both affect and are effected in games. I found it a bit light on scholarly sources, but since he is a professor, perhaps this book is more what he is teaching in his class than his own research. Not a bad read, if you can stomach some of prose."
3,"Bemuddled, but full of References","Hopefully this book will fall out of date fast, because in my opinion, the definitions and arguments that Juul presents are not going to withstand any test of time. Salen and Zimmerman's more open definition approach leaves much more space for the classification of games to come. If anything Juul has successfully shown me that games is a broad domain that is hard to classify under one definition. I find myself wasting time reading massive amounts of example games, but am left longing for Juul to ""get to the point"". Makes me wonder if the theory of this book won't fit in a pamphlet or small reference booklet.What I did get out of this book was a reference list of other works that I could read to use those in my work instead. That, and a reference to Juul as ""what not to do""."
2,Couldn't get into it,I skimmed though a portion of this and got the item on a whim but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I wanted. Simply a matter of personal taste. What I did read was well written but the subject matter wasn't for me.
