2,Avoid this disaster!!!!,"I have every Concrete Blonde and Johnette Napolitano CD, but this one is the worst of the lot. The only song I really like is Las Vegas...and it is no must have. IF you have the rest of the Concrete Blonde stuff and are looking for something different, get the Pretty and Twisted CD. It is a ton better than this one, or try to find Sketchbook by Johnette Napolitano.Keith S. :{)>"
3,a good find,"This cd I got because I knew Johnnette Napolitano was from Concrete Blonde and was curious about it. I don't know too much about Holly Vincent except that she sang with The Italians and The Oblivious. So, if your familiar with Concrete Blonde I can say this is similiar, just not as produced and a bit more raw, punk, indie. Anyway, I really like this. Alot of the songs are simple and catchy, so I got to know them pretty quick. You may also want to check out her other cd release from 1995, ""Pretty and Twisted"". It's a bit more like CB than this. I think both discs are out of print, so good luck."
3,"I gave this a B rating, read my Yahoo Review","One thing I may add, you might not want to buy the dvd. But renting it will not be a complete waste. Just as long as you go in knowing what the film is about."
5,all poeple who think this movie is lame can lick my wang,"grind is not only an extremely funny movie, but the skating in it and cameos are great, non skaters hate this movie cuz they know nothing about skate culture. with poeple like ryan sheckler, brian sumner, bam margera, terry kennedy, mike vallely in it, you will be very happy, haters can stick this dvd up their butt cuz this movie is amazing"
3,Ha ha! Great? Yeah right!,"This movie was straight jacked. I won't even lie, I only went to go see it because Bam Margera was in it, and I thought Ehren from Jackass was going to have something to do with the production of the movie. If you're not a pre-teen or head over heels in love w/ Bam Margera, then this movie is not for you. The stunts and 'funniness' was PREDICTABLE. The 'funny lines' I didn't even find them funny, but the 10 year old sitting next to me seem to crack up and die laughing. The only thing I can say good about this movie, is the appearences, they have a lot of nice special appearences. One would be skater, Mike V., Preston from Jackass, and the Swedish band Blindside. But, if you're looking for a GOOD laugh, buy Haggard or some of the cKy stuff."
1,Absoulutly Horrible!!!!!,"This movie is the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. Its subjects range from between sex, degrading women, vulgarity and obsenity. Not that I object to these subjects being in movies. Its actually fine with me.(With the exception of degrading women) But most movies that contain these things also have other more redeeming values. Also the plot of the movie could have been written by a 3 year old (with a very foul mouth) The acting is terrible and the jokes arn't funny. Do not see this movie unless you wish to be scarred for life. Im serious, its that bad. It is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,IS THIS A COMEDY?,"Cameos by Randy Quaid and Bobcat Goldthwaite and a song by The Donnas, don't really help GRIND (Warner Home Video). Four Chicago dudes travel across the country to be part of world professional skateboarding. The alleged humor is crude and forced. And there's not much of the pure joy of ordinary skateboarding. One good thing: there's no widescreen edition, so there's less bad movie in the frame. I gave it two stars because (1) it's in focus and (2) it's in color."
1,"This movie is so bad, go watch Out Cold!","Honestly, I cannot even dignify this movie with more than a few sentences of review. I was hoping for another Out Cold type experience with this flick, but the closest it came was Jason London's random cameo at the end. This movie is unfunny, unenjoyable, and has amazingly some pretty bad skating. Don't watch it."
1,Complete waste of time watching this movie,"About a half year ago, i saw this movie. All that i remember is one character who is just a complete retard. It had a few good skate scenes, but other than that, it sucked.If that one guy wasn't in the movie, it might have been worth watching. I can't remember anything about this guy. But that's all that I remember from this movie is that guy that i just can't stand. It was a complete waste of time watching this movie, just because of the one person that is in there. That's all i really remember from that movie, so it really wasn't good at all."
2,Cameos,"This is a skating/teen movie that has a lot of camoes. You can see Randy Quaid in clown makeup (havent we seen that before) The movie is your typical teen comedy, with fart, feces jokes, hot women,sports, and music."
1,cheap laughs,"the film was kinda corny&very cliched,but it had a couple of decent Laugh track moments.the skate board scenes were cool.some Pretty Ladies up in the film as well. but the film was a dime a dozen of cliched writing&Direction overall."
3,Close!,"I liked this movie, I truly did, but 3 stars is what I'm giving it. The whole movie was slightly choppy, but the acting was pretty good! Vince Vieluf deserves much better roles than THIS. I loved the apperances by all the pros, and I think that Ehren should have gotten a better role...I'm biased, haha! All in all, it's a cute movie that's good for a few giggles."
1,"The worst ""cash-in on the cool new scene"" flick ever...","To give this movie more than 1 star is to give corporate America your soul. This movie was made because skateboarding is all of the sudden THE thing. The cameos are somewhat cool, but under no circumstances should cameos carry a movie. (...)"
5,Grind Is A Good Movie For Skateboarding But Including Bam Was Awful,As I Was Saying Gring Would Be Better If Bam Wasnt In It
1,An appropriate name...,"This film really is a grind. It is not a good movie. It is simply a cash-in on the skateboarding sport, trying desperately to be cool by chucking in random outbursts of skating and celebs.There are so many negative things to say about this movie. The acting is ok, i like Adam Brody, but is far from stellar. The transitions between the actors skating and their professional skater stunt-doubles could not be clearer. I could have sworn one stunt double was 2 foot taller than his matched actor, with different coloured hair, trying his best not to look directly at the camera.If you want to see a proper skateboarding film with real fire, watch Dogtown and Z-Boys. Forget this."
4,Great skater movie,"Bought the movie for my son. He's almost 14. Says it's good, funny & great skater concepts."
5,Sky High!!!,"I agree with the other reviewer. This is intense material. To this day, Sky High remains a rock/pop anthem. Jigsaw stands the true test of time."
2,a brief history of the periodic table,"It is a very good idea to explain to teens how the periodic table was made and the book reads well. Some mistakes are irritating. For instance, the scientific community has not replaced azote (proposed by Lavoisier)by nitrogen: Nitrogen is the English term, effectively proposed by another Frenchman, Chaptal, but the French still use azote to name the substance.The historical part is fair, the part showing that the periodic table explains some rules of chemistry in nature is weak and comes too late and the part showing that the table can be used to guess the properties of elements is sorely understated.It seems to me that to be excited by the history of the periodic table, one should know first that it is useful. The author made a mistake by diving into history without making the aim attractive.I hope there will be a second better edition, because it would be nice to have a great book for teens on the subject."
5,LD son loved this book!,"The ""Mystery of the Periodic Table"" is that it makes learning fun! My son really likes this book! It keeps you entertained and is much easier to read than a typical old boring chemistry textbook! Highly recommend as a first step in introducing the periodic table to any child!"
4,My thoughts on reading the book,"I learned alot about the subject.The book cannot be read like a novel.Itrequires a page by page examination, but the results are worth the effort.I think that rereading this book a second time is well worthwile."
3,Needs illustrations,"This is a good, not great, attempt to help the layperson get a very basic foothold on the meaning of Quantum Theory. Unfortunately, the total lack of illustrations raises more questions that words can answer. For example: if a photon is a particle with mass, and he says that no body can reach the speed of light because it's mass will become infinite, how does a photon do it? The window reflection description also doesn't adequately describe the difference between a wave and a photon. Why can't a wave excite the electrons in the atoms of the glass as well as a photon can bounce off of them? Compare with the gold foil experiment. I need to talk to the author!"
2,good writing but...,"nice writing style and generally clear examples.HOWEVER, there are no tables and no figures. For example, if you want a list of all the sub-atomic particles and their properties, you wont find it here."
2,Quantum is a Word He Likes To Use - But Only in the Title,"I was disappointed with this book. As a student of quantum mechanics and quantum theory I am anxious to read anything new or original about this expanding and fascinating topic. This book is primarily a rehash of Einstein's old theories of special and general relatively, and only vaguely and briefly mentions quantum theory. Chown (or more likely his publisher) probably named this book ""The Quantum Zoo"" in order to attract more buyers, but the name is deceptive. It should hve been named; ""Einstein Revisited."" It like buying a book supposedly about modern aircraft that deals only with biplanes. Give it a pass."
2,Pick a speed and stick to it!,"Ax cannot seem to maintain a tempo for very long before applying rubato with a heavy and unsubtle stick. No competition for Hofmann or Cortot, to name my favourites."
1,DO NOT BUY,"HORRIBLE shoes for little girls! Bought a whole case for my 3-year old grand-daughter - she was SO excited. Put them on & walked from the living room to kitchen & they broke. Could have been serious, as it broke into sharp pieces. No support in the back of shoe for small feet that hit the shoe midway. Stay safe & buy the better built Disney shoes."
4,the classic,"I've read this about three times now, maybe more. What keeps taking me back is something like rain to the earth. These are indeed stories that are 'close to the earth' -- the human spirit, in all its simplicity, yet all its complexity. I read to a group of senior citizens and they often ask for more of this book. The stories read great aloud and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys an author who writes about the everyday, with a very deep insight into the human condition. Don't pass this one up."
4,A good book on the second read,"I had to read this book for my english class, and I must admit, the first time around it was very boring, which is the only reason i gave it a 4/5. My english teacher, however, showed me some interesting concepts to look for, and to read a little deeper. I tried to look into every word and find its own hidden meaning, and when you do that, the book becomes very enjoyable."
1,boring boring boring,"This is one of the most boring books i have ever read. There is no story. Nothing happens. Each sentence in this book is a long, drawn out, boring attempt to be profoundly creative. Do yourself a favour and just poke youself in the eye with a stick instead of reading this...."
4,A must read!,"This book was required for all students in my high school, and rightfully so. Not only did it make me laugh, it also led me to do a little introspection of my own, and to put lif in perpspective. WO Mitchell's writing will appeal to you, not only for the witty humour, but also for the hearfelt emotion his words can invoke in the reader.So if you just want to read something good for a change, this is my pick!"
1,Bad CF reader,"Bought this item from another online vendor. Use it mainly for the CF reader to upload pictures from camera. Pins in the CF reader bend easily and started to break. Does not read any of my CF cards now. Useless product. Even though it is cheap, do not buy this for CF reader."
5,Nice Reader,I have only used the xd and the micro sdhc parts of the reader but both worked flawlessly. Good product so far.
1,No good,"This product in fact I return to sender, up to now I have receive any response from the sender yet. This product doesn't work at all.Can anybody from AMAZON help me to recovered the fund that I paid for this product."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"Absolutely disgusted with this product. The processor is so slow that if takes hours to download the photos and then it will freeze so you have to start over again. There is a reason is is cheap, do not buy it--a waste of money."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"I received this product and I couldn't be more dissatisfied. First, it says on the package that the ports are marked with icons to make slots easy to distinguish. This is an outright lie. There isn't any marks at all. I tried copying files from a MS Pro Duo card and after 10 minutes of trying I was finally able to view the contents of the card but each time I tried copying from it my system would crash. The item itself feels like it will fall apart at the slightest touch as well."
1,Fails to install on mac OS X 10.3,"As other reviews have stated, this product simply fails to install. It assumes you are attempting to purchase a second state product. This is absolutely absurd. I purchased software that won't even install. Don't buy this. Just buy the Turbo Tax Deluxe and download the state software through it. The rebate is the same and maybe that method will work. If you did buy this, make sure your voice is heard by Intuit. [...]"
1,not multistate,"It should not be adverstized on this site as a multistate product. It does not say this term on the box, or by turbotax although the product as ""described by manufacturer"" on this site as such is misleading also. You get nothing more than what you would get for a download for one state and have to pay for any additional state's forms."
1,Bait and Delay,"Unlike the Mac Version, the Windows version will install . . . but the installation is nothing more than a promise to download the real program once its available. Moreover, the availibility date keeps slipping for California. First, it was supposed to be available Dec. 20, then Dec. 24, now it says ""on or after Dec. 28."" Since one of the major purposes of buying the software is to plan my taxes before year end, having it slip to December 28 is naturally a problem. What's more, I am not exactly full of confidence that it will even be available then.Ironically, the Intuit website says ""don't worry, the date on your CD will be the date that the software is available."" Um, guys? Then why do you keep changing the date on the CD?Yeesh."
1,Turbotax Failed,"Don't believe the rating of one. A minus 5 would have been more appropriate. After six years of being a faithful Turbotax user, the changes they have made in 2004 are convincing me never to use their product again - even if I could. After purchasing the downloadable version it failed to unzip. Three hours on the phone with representatives in India did not solve the problem. Finally I got them to send me a CD, which seemed to install but hung up on the question ""Select a tax return type"" that offered zero choices and no pull-down. I can't believe they would release a product that seems designed to frustrate their customers!!!"
4,Best textbook I have found,"I teach a report writing course at a local community college. I receive dozens of textbooks every year to review on criminal justice, many of them purported to be ""report writing made easy"" manuals. Mostly they are complex re-hashes of English grammar and writing composition, but do not really delve into the nuts and bolts of police report writing. I have used this text, and its various editions, for 9 years. It is easy to use. The book is layed out in a logical sequence to assist the new report writer in grasping the complexities of police reports and the exercises used in the book emphasize simplicity and proper English grammar. A must book for anyone who is a cop or is contemplating a career as a law enforcement officer."
5,Good Reference,This is a very good reference to have at hand. I am a petrophysicist and reading this book has allowed me to do a number of my computation much more accurately.
4,Good Deal,Great deal on the book! I was able to save a lot of money with this purchase. It was exactly the book I needed.
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,i bought this knob for $50 total...well i thought it was gonna atleast be good quality...buttttttttttt it came with cheap plastic adapters and the knob was never tight it would spin on my shifter easily and would sometimes fall off...went to walmart got a $15 knob and it works better than this thing..dont waste your time on it..you will not like it.
5,Definitely not already heard,"This cd was amazing.It's a lot better than most cd's out now.I love how they start slow and then just all out rock,many try,but few suceed.I like all the songs on it,except Tatou(sp?)which hardly counts due to it's length of under 2mins,so that's dismissed.Otherwise this cd is definitely worth your money and great for any mood,relaxing to getting ready for a night out.Oh and to that person who said people who like pop-punk wouldn't appreciate this,you're very wrong,I like pop-punk,punk,hard rock,classic rock,soft rock,pretty much every sub-genre of rock and I definitely appreciate this cd for what it's worth."
5,The first cd I've ever bought...,"Okay, it might sound wierd, an eighteen-year-old having just bought his first cd; but still true. The first time I heard the single ""The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"" the emotion exuding from the lyrics hit me hard-- music rarely exibits such raw power. Anyway, that being said, I now find that song as one of the weaker tracks; ""Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades"" ""The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot"" and, especially, ""Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't"" all far superior in lyrical depth and musical rifts. Jesse Lackey is definitely a poet...too bad most bands nowadays abandon the concept of writing worthwhile lyrics, especailly those with such double-meanings (buy the record, you'll see. It seems their talking about something else...). Perhaps now I'll buy their first...who knows."
5,Simply Amazing,"after i heard this cd for the first time i thought to myself ""what the hell was jessie thinking?"" then after a wile a few songs cought on to me and before i knew it i was in love with the cd just like i was with their first.... i saw these guys live recently and i wasnt to excited to see them play the new stuff but when they did i was suprised because it's all amazing..... this cd is by far the best cd of the summer.... lets just keep this band off mtv and not get play next to good charolette"
1,People Named Idiot Boy Liked This Album,"Folks, this is the epitome of ""emo"" music, a genre whos practitioners should be ""emoting"" while lying down on a Ph.D.'s couch instead of into a microphone. Absolute nonsense. Real musicians everywhere take heart: you could fall out of your bunk on the tour bus, fall into your musical equipment, and release a better disc than this. Screw Middle Eastern Terrorists, bands like Deja Entendu are the real threat to my America.Allah, Satan, and George Bush all agree - this album is terrible.A Real Music Fan"
2,what on eath happened?!,"this album isnt half as good as their first one, i dun wanna bitch coz brand new does rule, theres only one really really good song in this album and thats Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades, then theres The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows... and thats ok, nothing special, most of their other songs are all dull, boring and really slow, with like no instruments playing in the background, i hav read some of the reviews and there are heaps of ppl saying OMG BEST ALBUM EVA!!!! but i dont see it.. i want to but i just cant see it...."
1,What the hell,GOd I hate punk. These guys are just a couple of Good Charlotte wannabes (and who in their right minds would WANT to sound like the fags in Good Charlotte??) Teen angst? Please... Anger? If you want to hear angry listen to Slipknot's debut!
2,Sounds like all the rest of the junk on the market.,"The first Brand New album was great. They had a unique sound and played with passion. Although they have always been ""pop""-like emo I can accept that fact. While I would rate their first CD 4 out of 5 stars for being above average. I would have to rate this CD as painfully mediocre. I am sorry I purchased it. I tried listening to the droning lyrics and guitar that goes nowhere about 3 times over. I just can't get into this CD. Call it a matter of perspective, but there is no way you can ever rate this CD a 5 star score ESPECIALLY when compared to their first debut. This cd is slow, boring, and monotone. Sad. Download the MP3's first so you arent dissapointed as I was."
2,*Yawn* This CD makes me sleepy,"I was excited to hear this cd after all the hype with the song: ""Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades."" Well, I bought the disk only to discover that the only good song is the one mentioned above. The rest of the disc makes me...well...bored and sleepy."
5,EMO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Alright all you poeple out there. Brand New is NOT emo. This band is punk rock with a singer that you can understand what he is saying. EMO (if you must call it that) is bands like MXPX which i would truely refer to as POP ROCK. Although, if you asked any hardcore punk fan out there what this CD is and they will say that it is EMO or it just sucks. This is because it is on MTV and punk ""isn't"" supposed to be according to them. I LOVE HARDCORE PUNK and this is plenty un-emoish for me to like and purchase.EMO is bad, this CD is good."
3,"Deja Entendu, hmmm...?",These guys are on the cusp of a revolution. Deja Entendu? More like Deja Nintendo. Yes!
5,"it isn't supposed to be like thrice, thursday, etc.","It seems like every negative review I have read about this album claims that this cd isn't as hardcore as thrice and blah blah blah... Brand New has it's own sound. If you are looking for a hardcore album, you won't find it here, but you will instead find a masterpiece of an album with beautiful vocals and lyrics. This is one of my favorite albums of all time, with not one of these songs being any thing less than extraordinary."
5,Brand New-Deja Entendu,"Brand New's latest release deserves all of the critical acclaim that it is receiving. This truly is one of the top rock albums released in the year 2003. If you can appreciate good music and all the hard work that goes into creating an outstanding album, fork over the $12 for Deja Entendu. If Jessie Lacy keeps this up these fellas honestly could go down as one of the all time greats in the industry. Look for more good things to come.94/100"
4,Probably the Best of The Emo Genre,"Most emo-rock albums are straight-forward, with the standard 4/4 time signature, mainly power chords, and over-exaggerated emotions. Brand-New fell into this trap with their lackluster 2001 debut, but this time around they created something more ambitious, a mix of shifting tempos, intelligent and subtle lyricism, nuance, and gasp!- more than three chords! ""Sic Transit Gloria"" shocked the country upon its release due to an audible bass line, which hasn't been heard on rock radio since ""Ava Adore."" Brand-New also tend to experiment with new styles, but staying within their punk-pop template with undeniably catchy choruses: ""Jaws Theme Swimming,"" ""Guernica,"" and ""Good To Know..."" try out blues, trip-hop, and prog respectively, but also have the thrashing beauty hinted at on YFW. This is one of the better emo albums I've heard, and this is truly a band deserving of your attention."
5,Deja Entendu is AWESOME!! buy it now!!,"Deja entendu is a great album with excellent rock songs that any music listener would appreciate. The lyrics are original and thoughtful shown through Jesse Lacey's song writing talent. The songs have great melodies and the choruses are contagious. Each song is personal and one of a kind. It is soooo good, I've been listening to this CD for a really long time, and I'll never get sick of it. Go buy it if you want to listen to some really good music!! You won't be disappointed!!!!"
5,Wow,"This album is the album of year 2003. it has everything a good album needs + an improvement from the old album. the old album they werent exploring the differant kinds of emo, it was all about heartbreak and girls, which is good if your a little mainstream fashion punk, but for us who are looking for more, this is the album. the lead singer said in an interveiw that was regrets Your Favourite Weapon because all the songs were preety much about the same thing. good on him for admitting his faults, moving on and improving like no other band i've seen before. the two things i love about this album are the stadiness in the vocals and the creative guitar chords like in Me Vs Maradona Vs Elvis. Well done Brand New!"
4,Not As Good As I wanted,"I own Brand New's Old AlbumVery Good. - And this one is better lyrically and quality of the music and instrument playing.However, the best song they have ever written is Seventy Times Seven - An immense song - And This Album failed to reproduce a song of such quality. Some could have - Me Vs Madonna.. is such a dragged on experience, clustered and simple - THen the last chorus is suddenly turned up a couple of gears and sounds fantastic!If only that had been kept up for the entire song...The lack of high tempo for most of the songs is holding them back and I hope this is corrected for the next album"
4,Switching Up,"After being somewhat impressed by the first Brand New album I purchased Deja Entendu on the day it came out. This album, although different then the first, impressed me. It's very different from the first album, but this only shows how versitile the band is. That they can succeed at more then just one sound. While some of the songs I skip over, there a definite few that I keep on my playlists. My favorite song on this CD is 'Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis."" This song, by the first second, gives me an overwhelming sense of calm. The sound is deep and dark.And not only does the band deliver on their CDs, but also on stage. I was not disappointed at all by the change in sound. I actually found it to be refreshing, because pop-punk is far too much now days."
5,worth it,tatou- good introduction to the cd... 5/5sic transit- very catchy beat... bass sounds awesome 5/5i will play- good only for the first time... 3/5okay i believe- a very powerful song... one of the best on the album 20/5the quiet things- chorus is strong... guitar parts are catchy.. bass sounds too bland.... 5/5the boy- dont like it much... 2/5jaws theme swimming- very very good song... nice bass lines.... 7/5me vs.- its ok... too slow and boring... but lyrics are pretty good 4/5guernica- love the chorus... lyrics are good 5/5good to know- though this song is long... its lyrics and guitar parts make this song shine.... 6/5play crack the sky- guitar part is simple and sounds very relaxing 5/5this cd is worth your money
5,its all about the lyrics people.,"Ive heard alot of people describe this album as boring, but its so far from that. Jesse Lacey, the bands song writer, is so amazing with words. I cant get over how good the lyrics on this cd are. Whoever says these lyrics suck has no idea what theyre talking about. This is one of my favourite cds, at first I was a little skeptical but once you listen to what hes saying its amazing. This stuffs not for everyone though, if you like crap then dont buy this because its so far from it."
5,Growth,"""Pop punk."" That seems to be the most common description of Brand New's debut album ""Your Favorite Weapon."" ""Deja Entendu"" is definately NOT pop punk. Each song is different than the one before it. This is an album of growth. Brand New has progressed beyond the riffs and melodies they constructed on ""Weapon"" and have given us an album to prove it. There are so many layers of guitar here, as well as vocals. Sometimes they scream(Guernica), other times they barely whisper(Tatou). After listening through it a few times, you realize how well-written and well-played this album is. One track boasts: ""We are entirely smooth / We admit to the truth / We are the best at what we do."" With an album like ""Deja Entendu,"" who can disagree?"
3,An OK cd,"Brand New is one of my favorite bands but this cd is just ok. It doesnt have as much energy as Your Favorite Weapon did. Most of the songs are slow and they dont really catch your attention the first time you listen to them. But the lyrics are good.The songs all have a darker sound. They dont sing about losing their girlfriends to English guys anymore or anything like that. But in songs like ""The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"" it starts to sound like the old stuff.I really liked the song ""sic transit gloria...glory fades"" because it is darker but is still fast. But if you listen to this cd a few times the songs grow on you. I would recomend this cd to anyone who really liked Brand New, espescially their slower songs."
5,brand new rocks!,bran new's new album is a great blend of music they are the best at what they do and i love the titles of all the tracks
2,Unusual,"Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. This cd has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially ""Play Crack The Sky,"" which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either."
2,Remember the older stuff,"I've been reading the reviews and I have to say that I disagree. This cd was a big let down for me, being a big fan of the Your Favorite Weapon album. The songs are not very catchy and it seems they have changed themselves. The vocals aren't up to par with what they used to have. The album before this had all good songs, give or take a few. I'd love to see Brand New come out with something closer to Your Favorite Weapon, it would be a big help to everybody."
2,Sincerely Dissappointed,"I eagerly awaited this cd and bought it very very soon after it came out, hoping to get a hold of a cd that held all the same catchy and rockin music that was on their previous cd, but i was very dissappointed when i popped this cd into the player... they changed, and not in a good way. Every song is a slow song, its like chill music... by brand new! I love their old cd, its so rad, but this one just isnt them and just doesnt seem like it was something that they would have wanted to put out. I mean if you can give it anything, it is kinda new, and it has a fresh soft sound... but if you want another cd like their old one, dont get this one. If you can somehow, just listen to the first song, youll get a good grip of what the whole cd is like and how dissappointing it is."
1,went completely over my head,"every year someone releases a CD that is dubbed a masterpiece by a masses and i just can't comrehend it. Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head was the last one i can think of. I just listened to it over and over again and I couldn't see what everyone was talking about. It's the same thing with Deja Entendu, all these rave reviews from fans and critics alike and I just don't get it. so i guess in closing what i'm saying is that you really need to buy this cd and hear it for yourself, but keep the receipt because it is definitley not for everyone."
1,Huge Letdown!,"After listening to ""Your Favorite Weapon"" hundreds and hundreds of times, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the new ""Deja Entendu."" What a bust!!! Most of the songs were slow and depressing sounding, with little energy. I'd strongly reccomend getting a listen of the CD from a friend before you wasted your money on it. Hopefully Brand New can return to form on its next cd."
2,It's alright,"I wasn't terribly into Brand New before Deja Entendu came out, although I did like Taking Back Sunday, and I always saw them grouped in the same category. However, listening to their first album, all I heard was a mediocre band who played your typical emo-punk music. It's nice that they've tried something new with Deja Entendu, but yet again, all I hear is a mediocre band, this time ""maturing."" Even though the album has some decent tracks and an experimental edge, the way in which they've ""matured"" is far too predictible (a young punk band going artsy), and they appear to be trying all too hard to change their style. I do however enjoy their unique vocal approach and I like the fact that they put some thought into the album, although trying a bit too hard. Overall, it's a mediocre album, but not entirely worthless or unlistenable."
4,"The Brand new, Brand new","I have been a avid fan of Brand New since their Debut ""Your favorite weapon"" came out a couple of years back. And I have to say that it seems like I have been listening to a completly different band when listening to the new ""Deja Entendu"". The band has completly strayed away from the past use of poppy chorus' and ""boy meets girl and gets hurt"" lyrics. Instead we get more of an melodic mature taste of Brand New. The songs are filled with much more complex lyrics that one would seem to have to decode to understand at times. The songs are far more ""Emo"" than their previous effort and it seems it is a step in either the right or wrong direction depending on your tastes. For myself I think it is a great addition to their collection. The songs are equally catchy just in a different way. Stand out tracks are: ""The quiet things no one ever knows"" ""Guernica"" and ""Sic transit Gloria, Glory Fades"". Pick it up if you want to hear a Brand new , Brand New"
4,Good Album,"I like emo punk rock and hadn't heard of Brand New until recently. I bought this based on a recommendation from a friend. I like listening to it. It is unique but easy to get in to. This group is more lyrical than I expected from a young band which adds to the CD. Many groups like this can play and scream but the lyrics are weak. Brand New has that element of being clever writers as well. I would recommend this if you like Jack's Mannequin, New Found Glory, Angels & Airwaves, etc."
5,Thanks for helping Beth,"Second album from Brand New. Mature lrics, and a lot of break downs. Sad music, catchy guitars exspecially in #5. It's the best song. The lead singer has a good voice. Good Drums--tight. The guitars are modern but great. good electric and then an acoustic-#11. very little punk here. Just good old emo. There's nothing left to say except that they have talent and now are starting to hit it big. You can't really compare to their first album. Just buy both fr yourself from good old Amazon.com and see for yourself. It's acually cheaper online than at Sam Goody's and F.Y.E. Pick them up."
5,DAMN!!!,"This album is bad a$$. I usually listen to hip hop. A lot of stuff from the westcoast and of coarse some of the new stuff. I never really listened to emo and hell I never even heard of that word. But hanging out with some of my friends here at the base I'm stationed at cuz I happen to be in the AF. Ive been getting into it a lot. And the thing is that I accepted it quickly. But I havent accepted every song as quickly as ""Sic Transit Gloria ... Glory Fades "" When I heard of this song I just got off of work at 11 at night and walk over to my friends room and this video happen to come on. I just sat down and listened. I asked my friend who the group was and I just got the cd's. So now I'm a play the crap out of them."
4,Great music,"i really enjoy this band. they have diverse sounds that never seem to get boring, and are always enjoyable to listen to."
4,Grows on ya,"At first I bought this album and was rather disapointed but then I went back and listened to the whole cd over and got all these different songs stuck in my head. Truly turned around my opinion, a very well composed cd with great lyrics."
4,brand new brand new,"True to other reviews, brand new's new album is indeed much different than your favorite weapon. For those who enjoyed the upbeat, poppy nature of the first album, deja entendu has taken a turn for deeper, introspective music and lyrics. still, there are excellent hooks and even a song that's hitting the radio waves and a video's that's getting some play on mtv2. They sound a bit like taking back sunday with that emo tinge. If you live the san francisco bay area, i'd recommend going to the show at sf concourse exhibition ctr on sept 26 (dashboard confessional is headlining)"
5,Great new style,"I expected this CD to be a lot like their last CD, but I was wrong. ""Deja Entendu"" has a new sound but they still sound like themselves. You can tell from their lyrics that they have grown a lot as people and their lyrics are very honest. Two of my favorite songs on this CD are ""Sic Transit Gloria"" and ""The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"". They both have great melodies and lyrics. Unlike their last CD this one is more emo than punk. It still has that really good edge to it though that you don't find in most punk/emo music. I think anyone who liked their last CD will like this one. It does sound different but once you listen to it you won't be able to get these songs out of your head."
4,deja entendu... same band.. new sound,"Although at first listen this cd hardly sounds like traditional brand new quality... if you give it a chance... it could end up being the kind of cd ""that makes people glad to be where they are... with whoever they're there with"" (ok i believe you, but my tommy gun dont). the songs on this cd dont have the uptone beat of YFW... but the gradual build and eventual heavy sound of the songs on deja is uncomparable to any other artist. The lyrics too developed from the primere album... showing signifigantly more maturity.. and taking on many new themes. This cd is one of the best buys of the year... and cant be missed."
3,Interesting.....,"I like how brand new has a little heavier stuff in their new album. I also find it very interesting that a song is called Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades. It being a quote from the movie Rushmore, I knew it would be my favorite song on the album. If you are a fan of Taking Back Sunday and Further Seems Forever, this album should be a good buy for you."
1,This CD is really boring. Buy SOTY or THE USED instead!,If you like rock you won't like this album. The songs are almost all acoustic. Really Bad!!!
1,This is very bad!,"A person from my school recomended this to me so he let me borrow his copy for a little awhile. He was dead wrong. These songs can be boring and pointless.These guys are a terrible excuse of a band. This goes in my collection of a ""poison to the ears"" band."
2,New Brand,i think it would have been cooler if their band name was new brand. i only heard one song and i didn't like it. i just wanted to put my comment on the new brand thing. say it was helpful to you if you agree that it should be new brand.( I just put down a random rating because I didn't know what else to put.)
1,How could brand new forsake us?,"now just so u know if u never listened to brand new don't read this, if you cry when a flower gets stepped on ull love this emo junk. the first cd was intellegent punk, with the lead singer having loads of energy and all the songs (almost) being loud and catchy. so i immediatley bought this cd when it came out. let me tell you, the songs are from some empty shell of brand new. the main vochalist sounds like he's on ritalin or valuim or something, and the songs are all depressing, not revitalizing or infectious. stay away if ur a fan, leave them with good memories."
1,Emo sucks!,"To that person who called this 'the best CD of 2003', go buy 'Dance of Death' by Iron Maiden and tell me what's the best album of 2003!!! As for this album, it sucks. Listen to Iron Maiden, they kick ass!"
5,Aucun,"Cet album est tout simplement excellent. Il est très différent de tout ces Punk-Rock band. Brand New fait du Emo, du vrai! J'adore la voix de Jesse et la voix de Vin. Un excellent groupe avec un excellent album. Mes préférés: Me.vs.Maradona.vsElvis. Cette chanson est ""unkind"" Les paroles de cette chanson son tellement étrange! Okay I believe you my tommy gun don't est aussi une de mes préférés juste à cause de l'interprétation de Jesse. Guarnica est aussi une de mes préférés. Cette chanson est EXCELLENTE. Toute les chansons ont leurs particularités. Elles sont toutes très différentes et trate de sujets parfois ""normaux"" mais parfois vraiment étrange. Bref un excellent album, un de mes préférés. Le band est super et regarder pour le 3e album qui devrait tre enregistrer en septembre. J'adore Brand New!!!"
4,"The album is great! needs more violent lashing out, hehe","Im sorry, but this isn't a review. I'm just posting this in hopes that the massive tool who wrote all the nonsense about somehow having to hate this album if they liked the first one will come across it. Pal, your pretentious attitude depletes what little, if any sense you could have made through your narrow-minded review."
5,Incredibly Awesome,I am a from Pennsylvania and I LOVE PUNK MUSIC AND THIS CD IS BY FAR THE BEST THING EVER BUY BUY BUY
5,This song is about who I don't want to write about anymore,"The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with whomever they're there with. Unreal. Buy this. Now. Song 4 may be one of the best songs I have heard in a while. I can replay it 1000 times and not get sick of it. Anyone who has or is going through tough times in there life need to get this. His ability to scream is amazing. And buy the Used, and Chevelle, and Finch. All great bands. And Interpol too."
3,Sadness...,"OK...So I love Brand New but I'm not really into this CD. It's good but Your Favorite Weapon was killer (no pun intended)...I'm just really dissapointed in the CD. But go see Brand New live! I saw them when they toured with Dashboard, MXPX and Piebald. (piebold? one or the other) but yea they're awesome in concert so GO BUY A TICKET. NOW."
2,....um....very bad at first but....,"When my friend first lended me his CD to listen to, i was like, ugh, how can people listen to this. And it still left a bad flavor in my mouth to this day. I got used to it later after the 10th listen! Seriously this is not for everyone. extremely overrated. the only good song was Sic Transit Gloria, and the opening song Tautou, if you can really call that a (full) song. The rest has a large amount of almost country music style to it. bleh! Sure I like punk to general rock, but this is so....bad! This is punk and country. maybe that's what emo is, i don't know. Don't buy this CD, buy it only if you are a huge emo and punk fan."
1,What did you do guys....,"Hey, look this CD is a bunch of crud. Your Favorite Weapon is one of the best CD's there is out there, and you know how every song on there is about some girl they know? Well something big happened between Deja Entendu and the last album. Something real bad. The album is so terrible, they never rock out. Number 9 is really the only good song, 4 5 and 10 are ok however. But this CD really [is bad]. Brand New changed EVERYTHING about themselves, and its for the worse. Big let down you guys..."
1,Jesse Lacey and his Multiple Personalities,I think this album sucks. How many songs can you write that sound like another band or another lead singer.this album contains songs like:1. the one that sounds like coldplay2. the one that sounds like bright eyes3. the one that sounds like Taking Back Sunday4. the one that sounds like Lucero..........and so on.....get a clue make yourself a mix cd of all of the following bands and basically youll have this album...and youll save yourself some money... or go ahead and buy the album...maybe jesse will eventually make enough money to buy himself a new ego...or a better attitude...
1,Deja Entendu? exactly,"Deja Entendu translates to 'already heard'. Which is pretty much a two word summary of the entire album. This band, made all the worse by using ridiculous foreign language translations in their titles, is pretty much a gigantic peice of lame. They weren't good on their last album, and because they have infiltrated the commercial world (actually, the entire world is one big commercial) they are all the more worse. That one song is on MTV2, which means when you watch it, you are a loser. I don't know how that logic works, it just does. If you like this music you might also consider suicide."
2,overrated,"i don't really understand all of the five-star reviews for this album. at most, there are three, MAYBE four good songs on the entire cd. ""sic transit gloria..."" and ""okay i believe you.."" are both really, really good songs, but other than that, the cd is lacking severely, especially to be receiving so much praise."
2,Read this before buying!,"If you really liked Brand New's ingenius combo of heavy, relatable lyrics with clever riffs and hooks, you might be surprised by this album. I picked it up as soon as it came out because I really loved their ""Weapon"" album. If you liked the slow songs on ""Weapon,"" you'll probably love this album. It is very slow. There are some good hard parts on the album, but you have to sit through an awful lot of depressed drumbeats and poeticizing to get to it. Did the guitarist get fired? I don't know if it's necessarily a bad album, but I was sorely dissappointed. Check the sample tracks before you buy this one."
2,Who died?,"The quick witty lyrics, the almost original Lifetime-inspired vocals, and pretty much everything that makes this band good is missing in this album. Most of these songs are so depressing it makes you wonder who died. Way too much emphasis on Jesse's monotonous vocals which get old around the middle tracks and the other guy has obviously been taking singing lessons from Linkin Park.All in all, pretty disappointed considering ""your favorite weapon"" rocked so much and people built this one up way too much. If you don't have their older album listed above..by all means get it before you even allow yourself to listen to this one. Deja Entendu is really depressing...not good for rocking out in the summer...maybe for crying in the winter."
2,YFW Fans Beware!,"Every once in awhile, you WANT the bratty, brash, pop-punk band to whine about heartache and lousy childhoods, and when they do it well, you can't help but embrace them for it. So you can imagine my surprise when I anxiously popped Deja Entendu into my car stereo, only to find a pretentious, over-baked mess, living under the guise of maturity. If this is what maturity breeds, I don't ever want to grow up. And I don't want my favorite bands to grow up, either. If I wanted to hear mopey emo done well, with a beat I can't dance to, I would have popped the new Dashboard Confessional in instead. So to make a long story short, if you're looking for another YFW, look someplace else, because Deja Entendu won't be be giving you YFW deja vu anytime soon."
4,good listen,"Much better and more grown up then the previous record. I love the way they just wrote good rock songs and didn't worry about breaking new ground, its like they werent even trying they just played and what came out was great all buy itself. Keep it up."
3,",,,,,","this cds preety suprising, but its not a bad suprise. Though nothing like their previous album which I thought was amazing, this ones not all bad. Its not exactly what I was expecting or hopeing from brand new, but they are great artists, and continue to persevere on this album. Not the best, but not bad at all."
4,great cd,"this cd is an awesome cd. I was dissapointed however only once, when i listened to there old cd (your favorite weapon) after hearing this. The lyrics were much deeper on your favorite weapon. I like that cd better but this cd is still very good. If you are a punk/emo lover, this cd is for you."
3,Good to pass the time,"Probably my least favorite of the series. This is one I would have rather borrowed from a friend than buy myself. While Forester is true tithe legal theme, the depth and intricacy of plot isn't there in this story."
2,SPIP IT,This was a pedestrian legal thriller. Everything is pretty predictable. I think I guessed what would happen by page six. Not the worst but very skippable.
3,Easy Read,I can't say any of these books are all that well written but they are easy to read and entertaining.
4,Enjoyed it.,I really enjoyed this series of thrillers. I like the way she writes. It helld my interest all through the book.
3,Character Witness,I had a hard time to keep interest in this book. I really enjoyed her other booksso I will try again to finish reading this book.
2,READABLE BUT NOT EXCITEABLE,"Acceptable storyline but not impressive. I have read prvious of the series, this item did not equal the earlier volumes"
2,Disappointing,"Of the four ""witness"" series I found this the weakest link. The perpetrator was too obvious too soon and the characters too predictable. Wished I stopped reading the series when I was on the up."
4,LIke all the books in this series,"This is a new author for me, but have read all the books in this series and like them very much."
1,"A book on business strategies, not traveling for work","I only got about halfway through the book, so maybe in the end he started giving strategies for traveling most of the time for work. All of the book that I was able to get through were general business strategies, such as ""be ethical"". This was a book geared towards people who own their own consulting firm as there is a lot of information about client relationships in there. As I don't own my own consulting business, and was looking for information on how to travel 90-100% of the time for work and maintain your relationships and sanity I didn't finish the book and only gave it one star."
5,Do-able recipes for everyday!,"This cookbook features meals from salads to desserts as well as snacks and special treats for better health for everyone. With recipes from Better Homes & Gardens Diabetic Cookbook, meals can be made considering the needs of a diabetic without 'singling-out' that person with an unusual plate of food. These are delicious meals with the food exchange system used (a list is at the back of the book for making following meal plans easier). Even attractive garnishes are suggested so these recipes can be used to appeal to more than just the palate. Normal ingredients in the pantry or easily purchased at the local grocery store make these meals do-able.This is a practical purchase for any home and a must-have for those with diabetes."
5,Simple easy to use explanations/recipes for new diabetics.,I was in a panic having just learned the importance of following a diabetic diet plan. It is crucial to maintaining good health and preventing further problems for diabetics. The diet plan (which you need to get from a dietician in order to use this book effectively) was prescribed but we couldn't envision following it on a day to day basis. This book really helped us get started right away. The use of pictures and lists simplifies what at first seemed like a maze. I highly recommend it if you (have already received your diabetic diet plan and) feel you'd like a little hand holding during your learning process... and then some
3,Always over-eager,"3 1/2Though fairly overwrought when seemingly channeling his own inner Joplin, the energetic arrangements more often than not let Brown's roar soar."
4,"Great tool bag, watch out it can get heavy fast.","I'm a Field Service Engineer and I've been using this bag for almost a year now. I occasionally fly with my tools and this bag has been checked probably a dozen or more times now. It frequently comes off the baggage claim upside down but this thing has held up great and it only has one small scuff on the top lid. I find that I've had to load it down with so many parts and tools that it has become too heavy for me to carry around so I purchased a magnacart folding hand truck to dolly it around. The four slimmer pockets on the outside work great for quick access to your go to tools. I use 4 caribeeners on the outside to keep the zippers up when I check it, so far knock on wood I haven't lost any tools yet. The only knock I can give it is I wish it had a handle and wheels. Great BAG! and Stanley has really stepped it up a knotch with this one!"
4,"Helpful, Informative, But Not Definitive","The book gives unique insights into workers compensation claims in general but obviously can't help the fact that all 50 states have vastly different workers comp systems that apply facts of injuries differently. The author is knowledgeable about workers comp claims generally, though, and gives some very good strategies that I will pass on to my clients.Chad T. Snow[...].[...]."
3,Cute but not functional,"I checked this item out today at the store while buying the In Flight bedding set. I really wanted it, but it is impractical. It is made of cloth with a batting or something in the middle. There doesn't seem to be a good way to mark heights on it. The only thing I can think is to use a permanent marker, but I'd be afraid it would bleed. If someone comes up with a way to actually USE it, I'd be happy to hear! Otherwise, I'd save your money and buy some of the other cute accessories and find a different growth chart."
1,"Overpriced, cheap ingredients","Eukanuba is junk with crap ingredients. They have good marketing and packaging to make you think it is high quality when it is actually the exact opposite. The same can be said for IAMs. Eukanuba gave my perfectly healthy boston terrier skin problems which although weren't his cause of death, it was the first domino that led to his death. If I had not fed him this junk, he would still be alive today. Im not a random case. The problem is byproducts, fillers and the use of corn. You mind as well feed your dog alpo and save yourself the money. No dog food should contain byproducts,soybean or corn."
3,"Perry Como - Songs are Great, Quality is Not.","I am a big Perry Como fan. I grew up on ""Catch A Falling Star."" When I saw this CD, I had to have a copy of it. It is indeed an impressive line-up of songs. Lots of his hits are here and several other good songs. The CD is a good one. However, I stop short of saying it is terrific. I was disappointed. Not very much of it was in Stereo or really great quality. Yes, I realize the recordings were from LONG ago but we live in the technological age. Aren't albums redone, re-recorded, tweeked etc. all the time to improve them? Also, these songs must have been recorded somewhere more recently in Stereo. I would have enjoyed it much better if that would have been the case. Songs are still good, though. If you are not a Stereo buff as I am, do not care about the headphones and Stereo separation and quality, this CD will do very well."
5,GRAPHIC NOVEL AS LEGITIMATE LITERATURE,"I got my ""Good-bye, Chunky Rice"" 6th printing copy last week and read it twice. The first reading, I savored the letters; and the second, I focused on the visual art. Both elements are excellent. The story is not new but with the honest and juvenile yet pure approach of the author made it fresh.In simple words, this is poetry. The visuals are simply delightful. Be prepared to be mesmerized by the author's rendition of the sea. I loved the bittersweet fable with quirky characters. And oh, the ending was pure genius just like the ending of the movie ""Before Sunset"". I'm glad graphic novelist like Craig Thompson is discovered and accepted by the readers. I congratulate him for delivering a first-rate literature. Write on, Craig. ""There are no words"" to express how much I loved your work. Bravo!"
3,cute & sweet,"good-bye, chunky rice is a short little cutie of a comic & it carries some sweet poignancy about friendship & finding a place in the world, but i didn't find it quite as profound as some of the other reviewers.i think some of the flashbacks were a bit off-putting as in 'wait, where are we now?"" & although chunky rice was certainly a darling little character- what was he searching for? i longed for a bit more depth.warning! this little book took me under 20 minutes to read- so i recommend getting it from the library or borrowing it from a friend first. if you love it (and most of the reviewers really did), then buy it. it's pretty pricey for such a quickie read."
3,"hate to crash the 5-star party, but...","I agree with the positive things everyone else said. Certainly about the artwork; it's teriffic. One little snag is that the layouts are a little too mechanical and boxes-within-boxes intricate for the material.Anyway, Thompson should have done some research about what it's like to be on a ship -- clearly he was completely guessing. Also, the guy whose name I forget, the turtle's friend -- NO ONE talks like that. Also, just plain, why did Chunky Rice leave? He could have had SOME kind of reason. I don't know, maybe I'm just too logical.great book -- read all the positive things everyone else said -- i agree with them.note that (as of the writng of this review) the cover pictured on the top of the page is the current printing's cover; the ""look inside the book"" pictures are from the old edition. The book was re-designed (cover, endpapers, etc.) by the author last year.-yakov."
3,Not so much...,"This is the third graphic novel that I gave a shot and I'm not impressed. It was cute and okay, but the storyline was lacking and unfinished.I enjoyed the expressions and pictures, but could not get past the lack of storyline. It is possible that I am just not a graphic novel person."
5,Makes comics high literary and visual art!,"This stunning comic was so good I read it in one sitting (no breaks) and even cried at the end. It would make an excellent gift for a friend or a traveller (graduates!). I highly, highly recommend Chunky. It was breathtaking. I couldn't share it fast enough."
3,Great exercises,"Books like this are always problematic for me because although many (like this one) have great writing exercises, they also have a lot of boring, self-indulgent narrative (like this one). As a text to get writing exercises, this is very helpful and I have used it for myself, my creative writing students, and my adult writers' group. Sorting through the samples is less interesting. I recommend it as a reference book, but not as a good read."
5,This is a milestone book,Tarot Mysteries is truly an eye opener. I never thought that the tarot cards could range over so many fascinating topics. An excellent and informative read.
1,No excuse for this distortion of Tarot history,"This is a book that should not have been written. Frankly, more accurate and honest information about Tarot symbolism and history is available for free on the Web. By careful omission of many facts, Dee ""proves"" the occult origins of both the Trumps and the playing cards (Minors). That there is no bibliography, footnotes, endnotes, or citations of any sort should warn you, this is fantasy going after your money."
4,my son learning spanish on dingo lingo,My son really liked the Dingo Lingo video in the spanish version. He loved the silly characters and sounds. I think this is a good way to teach young kids how to learn spanish. I recommend this product to parents whom have young children. :)
5,Dino lingo,"My kids love Dino Lingo..With kids at home due to summer break it's sometimes hard to find educational shows/dvd that can keep you little one's interested. What I love about Dino Lingo it grabs little one's imagination with the bright colors and characters. The dvd also feature different languages including: English, Spanish and Dutch just to name a few. My kids are in love. I find the little one jumping around singing some of many songs. He also learned how to say ""Dog"" but he says Dag ""Cat"" is Khat. It's so cute. I think considering he's 1 yrs. old that's awesome.. My older child is learning Spanish.. Always screaming Hola and Uno.. lol.."
4,Great product,This is a wonderful tool to help your child learn another language. Wish my parents had done this with my as a child.
4,Very good Program,My 3 1/2 year old really enjoyed this program. She loved watching all the animals and learning the new words. Only thing I would improve on is perhaps make it a bit more interactive or add in a bit of explanation in English for the younger ones to catch on as to what the Spanish phrases are getting at/doing.
4,Perfect for toddlers,I received a trial version of this product and my 2 and 3 year holds were entranced. Even my 5 year old was repeating everything she heard. I will definitely be purchasing the full kit.
5,Trial Vimeo in Spanish,"My kids and I watched a trial Vimeo for the Spanish program.My two older kids are already taking Spanish in school,but they watched anyway.My 7 yr old daughter was intrigued!She has picked up a couple of words from Watching Dora the Explorer which she loves.She was glued to this vimeo,she loved the cartoon slides and she followed along by repeating the words in Spanish!I think this looks like a wonderful program for kids of any age to learn the basics of a language,the equivalent of the first year in school I believe."
4,Dino Lingo,Both my kids loved the Dino Lingo and want to keep watching it. Its a cute fun little video that gives them the spanish word and they recognize the picture and say it in spanish and english.
5,Great and easy to follow,I recently was given a demo version of this product and I must say it is a great learning tool for children! I was playing it for my step-kids that are in their teens and after watching it we all were walking around reciting phrases from each chapter. The characters are very interactive and the phrases are easy to pick up. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to teach their children a second language since this is something you can pop into the DVD player and let them listen to it all day. They will pick it up and learn quickly! I sure started to!
5,LOVES IT,"My 5 year old really enjoys this! He had fun watching it while learning new words. So great for teaching kids. My Son knew some of these words because they teach him spainish at school, so this was a great review also!"
5,dino lingo rocks,my daughter has been trying out all the differrent languages and dino lingo makes it especially easy to learn. thanks mom voxbox
5,Great for kids!!,This dvd set is easy for kids to learn another language!! My kids enjoy these as they teach them in a fun way!!
4,makes learning fun,"dino lingofor kids helps to make learning more fun! i find that if my kids are having a good time, they don't think of learning as a chore."
4,Easy & effective program!,Dino lingo makes learning another language fun! I never thought my daughter was capable at her age of learning any words from another language but this program makes it easy. What a quality/fun way to learn! =)
5,my kids loved this,"Influenster and Dino Lingo offered free language lessons as part of a Mom VoxBox I received recently. I wanted to fairly review this item and not having younger children of my own I enlisted my friends 7 year old. We sat down at the computer and I asked her which language she would like to learn. She seemed VERY excited to try out Spanish (I blame Dora! Hehe) From the moment the video started, she was HOOKED. Half way through she was chanting ""Rawrrrrr estes es un leon!"" LOL This video was great! So easy to understand and lots of fun, vibrate pictures and cartoons. After it was all said and done, (and a few minutes of begging for a replay) her mother was so impressed by her interest we decided to go to the website and check it out. That's where we found out not only do they have videos, but CD's. books, poster, games, songs, flash cards and more! They take learning in stages. It doesn't seem like anything more than a good time to the kiddies"
3,Dino Lingo Brand Challenge,If my daughter was older it would be great.... she still learning to speak English... but a very good product kept her watching
3,Easy to use,"My daughter absolutely loved it, very easy to use and a great learning tool! We will def use over and over again."
4,Wonderful,My daughter loves these dvds. It has really helped her learn spanish. She gets into the dvds and I would recommend them to anyone wanting to teach their child a foreign language. They are fun and kids pick up on them fast.
4,So cute!,This is a perfect solution to getting kids to learn and have fun with learning a new language! my child loved it!!
4,He loves it!,My 3 year old son loves the DVD we recieved through Influenster! Especially the Spanish section! He's catching on quick and even repeating the words! He's requesting to watch it everyday now without my coaxing him!
3,"Great concept, Easy to Learn, not so great graphics & animation","My Opinion: The animation and graphics leave ALOT to be desired. My daughters are used to iPads and HDTV so this was not comparable and they let me know. However, I LOVE the concept and the program's curriculum. My 2-year-old was repeating Spanish words immediately and used them later. I was impressed! She really did get excited watching it and I was ecstatic to see her learning so quickly. This would be perfect for early learners trying to learn a second language as they learn their first. If the animation and graphics were improved this product would very much be work the $99.55 for me."
5,Great To know,"I didn't received the Dino Lino DVD from Influencer to try, but I was able for free to do a 22 min trial of a lesson and my grandson did Spanish. Foreign Language doesn't come easy to for anyone to learn so I would definitely consider buying this program in any language that you may wish to learn or to teach your child or well even yourself I will be looking into get this for my grandson and for some of my own children to help them learn from this."
4,DinoLingo for Kids Spanish,"DinoLingo for kids is a super easy, fun way for children to learn a new language. It incorporates cute characters and scenes that get the child interested and involved. This is a great way to start early and learn at home, while having fun at the same time.My child has only watched a few bits of this product so far and already can recognize spanish words. This is definitely a great option for someone that wants their child to learn a language, but they do not know one themselves. Your child will not want to stop watching the DVD."
3,Rises Above the Novelty Premise,"That this album's covers are mostly of Sixties and Seventies classics is its saving grace. Consistantly great song choices coupled with a few inspired vocal and instrumental performances make this collection rise above its somewhat ""novelty"" nature. Purely entertaining, and certainly not pretending to be anything it's not."
2,screen broke after falling on the CARPET,"I thought I liked the phone a lot after I got it brand new from T-mobile. Then it dropped on the CARPET of my apartment, from the dining room table (a very short distance) and the screen went black. I had only used it for 3 days. T-mobile did not refund or replace the phone..."
2,The phone is crap,"I have had this phone for ten months and within in the first few hours of having it the screen was already scratch from putting it in my pocket. The phone also has a very crappy battery and my friends who have the same phone say that their batteries don't hold power well either. The buttons on the front and sides of the phone are not to great either. All of the buttons on the front of my have at some point either got stuck or just haven't worked. On my friends' phones, they have had many of the buttons fall off. The music player on the phone is okay. The phone also has a problem with the password and security section because even when i first got it it would not let me set a password or make it password protected. A good thing about the phone is that it can fall down a flight of stairs and still work the same as it did before. Oh, yeah the back is very difficult to take off and as time goes by it gets even more difficult."
2,Very low quality item from Nokia,Bought this one for my wife during our contract renewal. We have been loyal customers to our carrier since 1999. Very first month phone starting to act up. T-mobile renewed it. The second phone was not better either.The phone's music features were much better than what this one was designed for: talking on the phone. What a disappointment!!!
3,"Nice phone, decent music player","No IPOD, but works fine as a phone, durable. Music player is good enough, software from Nokia doesn't always cooperate."
2,Drops calls - unreliable - can't listen to music anymore,"I've had this phone for 4 months now. At first I loved it, but after about the first week, I started to find glitches. I only use it for calls and listening to music. Here's what's wrong with it now:1. After first week, noticed that it would restart itself in the middle of phone calls, effectively dropping the phone call.2. During the first month, it started interrupting songs because it was waiting for voice commands - I never pushed any buttons so I don't know why it did this.3. Last month it stopped recognizing the headphones when they were plugged in. Now it will only play music through the speakers.4. Today it started working only through the speakerphone. I couldn't turn speakerphone off to have a private conversation. Restarted the phone, and now it seems to be back to normal.I thought that maybe I just happened to be the unlucky one with the bad phone, but saw these reviews and realized that maybe this isn't a good phone: [...]"
2,not very good,"The phone felt fragile. Not very good. It looks better in the picture but feels too platic like in real.Returned it, Amazon handled the return fairly well."
3,Review,Good Points->looks good->Good Voice Quality-> Good Music qualityNegative Points->Less Talk time for the battery
1,Not a good phone,"This may be a good music player but it is NOT a good phone. After 8 months of regular use the buttons aren't working to go through the menu options and it gets ""stuck"" on certain pages or options. This phone is Nokia, supposedly one of the better phones for reception, and the reception is terrible and it is not because service is strong or weak."
5,Great video for the little ones!,"This is a great DVD for the little ones - it has a lot of good features on the DVD so you're not stuck watching the same video over and over again. My son is almost 2 and absolutely loves ""Narny"" videos. This is the second one we've purchased that he adores. It's almost exclusively music, which is what holds his attention the best. I highly recommend this video if your little one is into Barney!"
3,Q: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? A: My Two-Year-Old,"Tthis video is filled with many of my daughter's favorite songs and nursery rhymes. Unfortunately, it also includes a puppet show of the Three Little Pigs and a very scary Big Bad Wolf. Luckily the scene comes early on in the video so you can fastforward it. However, I didn't expect a Barney video to upset my two-year-old. This is not our favorite Barney."
4,Lots of Barney Songs for toddlers,"My twenty month old daughter really enjoys watching this. There are actually two videos on this dvd and all the songs are good ones. It has a lot of features compared to more recent dvds. I especially like the jukebox feature that allows me to select one or a few songs to play at a time. There are songs about washing hands, brushing teeth, and eating healthy snack as well as toddler favorites about animals and dancing and clapping hands. Yes, it's Barney, but my daughter really connects with the singing and dancing. Just be careful, you'll end up with these songs in your head!"
3,Ghastly Glory,"""The Ghastly Ones"" is a book of short rhymes accompanied with excellent illustrations of murder and monsters by the brilliant Richard Sala. Fans of Sala's gothic horror comics will enjoy this as well though it is much shorter than his previous books.It's a small paperback book with a rhyme, usually a sentence or so on one page, and an illustration on the opposite page. You can get through it in no time but Sala's unique drawing style is what makes the book.If you've read and enjoyed Tim Burton's ""Oyster Boy"" or Tom Baker's ""Boy Who Kicked Pigs"" or are looking for a kind of more grown up version of Dr Seuss, this is your book. Fans of Sala's work need no further encouragement."
5,More Princess to enjoy!,"I have recently purchased Tinker Bell. I bought the doll because I have gotten almost all the dolls in this line for my neices. I was thrilled to see Tinker Bell. Her hair is a really pretty golden color, and her wings really do flutter. The dolls' coustume is really pretty and Tinker Bell comes with a wand, comb and fairy friend. I love the fact that Playmates Toys has introduced so many characters. This doll is like the others in durability, fun, and education. All are worth 5 stars to me!"
5,Fantastic,"This is one of Elis Regina's earliest albums, released when Elis was about 20 years old. The depth and maturity of her voice is obvious on this CD and while the songs don't remotely resemble samba, they're great jazzy little ditties from the 60s. If you're a fan of Brazilian music or of jazz in general, you would probably like this. My personal favorites are Menino Das Laranjas, a peppy little jazzy number, and Joao Valentao, which really shows off Elis's terrific voice."
3,my 4 year old likes the game,"game works great, fun for my 4 year old to play,some parts are a little difficult for his age though, but he loves spongebob!"
2,Employee of the Month,I bought this for my four year grandson and wanted to play and learn it before I give it to him. I don't think it will hold his interest. It is too difficult to find the tresures and complete the game He likes Sponge Bob so maybe he will just enjoy playing on the computer with this game
2,Very unhappy with purchase,Movado watches are nice watches but i recommend you buy elsewhere.I ordered the watch for my wifes christmas present on Dec 5th but did not receive it until a week after christmas. When it came the crown to set it was frozen so we could not set the time. We send it back and received another one this one worked but it looked like someone ran sandpaper on one side of the band it was all scuffed up.I wish I did'nt try and save money and spend the extra 200 dollars and bought it somewhere else at least I would have got a quality product that Movados should be.This is my worst experience with Amazon but it only takes one like this to be a very disatified customer.
5,Boulder head,Refreshing to read something by an author who is not affraid to find fault in the bonehead mentality of political correctness.
1,for the first reviewer of this book.,"so tell me, what are the chapter titles?im surprised you were able to post such a quick review with the book just being shipped--as well of a nice demonstration of anonymous cutting remarks towards a couple of people who are no doubt prominent figures in this book. anonymity is a great shield. a great way to help sell books."
3,Good Info but poor writing,"I loved the facts addressed in this book. I believe the author uncovered a true bias that needed to be published. However, this is an extremely poorly written book. It's too bad that the information couldn't have been presented in a more organized manner. Each chapter repeats itself with only a few additional tidbits inserted."
5,Great Product!!,"I really love this DVD. The condition it came in was great, and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
3,A Step Down from prior DVDs,"Watched this on PBS and was distressed by several issues. First, there were only three ""Celtic Women"" singers and the preparation for the tour seemed at a significantly lower level than all prior tours. I missed the crystal clarity of the missing voices of Maev, Hayley, Alex, and Lynn from prior tours. Second, most of the pieces were either solos or unison arrangements and the overall impression comes across as musically anemic and unpolished compared with the rich harmonies and tight timing synch of the prior tours. I was looking forward to seeing this next tour in person, but will most likely pass on this year's version as it is not up to the standard I have come to expect in Celtic Woman performances. It is not BAD, it just is clearly a ""rebuilding year"" and it shows too much."
3,Not their best!,"I just think they use their arms too much. Like in 'A Spaceman Came Travelling' - how to the arms add to the song at all?And I always thought a tribute was more than two songs, but there you go.A New Journey is still, and will seemingly always be, my favourite Celtic Woman concert."
4,Celtic Woman Believe,Very Diappointed. I did not like having only three singers. It left a lot missing I have some other DVD's which are excellant and have watched Celtic Woman a lot but I was really disappointed in tonights program on pbs. The whole show left a lot to be desired.Of xcourse I cannot blame the girls as they are always excellant. I just wish we had the other two back.I checked onAmazon for a price. I am not sure if I will order or not. Oh well I probably will.
2,Celtic Woman-Didn't quite work out for me,"Like most of the reviewers here, I caught this one on PBS and recorded it on my DVR. Watched it with my parents of course, but unfortuantely, I just couldn't quite connect on the song choice as with the others. I mean, it was ok even though I don't have this particular DVD to go along with the other ones I already got, but the songs themselves just didn't have the spark like before. Overall, I just wasn't really happy with this one, and decided not to buy it. Ah well, better luck next year."
5,Great Girls,"This is great for anyone who is sick of all the trash music, the girls are true artists,there is no fast forwordsongs. This video is great from start to finish, when ever we get tired of the junk, we go get the girls and enjoy the evening."
5,I enjoyed every minute of it,"Celtic Woman is entertaining as always. The women vocalists are beautiful and talented. I think the new singer, Lisa Lambe, sounds great and fits right in. The orchestra, with bagpipes and all, sounds amazing. And the songs are filled with emotions. My favorite ones would be: Follow On, Nocturne, A Woman's Heart, A Spaceman Came Travelling, My Heart Was Home Again, and The Parting Glass. I'm also happy that the quality of the video is DVD standard, much better than the previously titled ""Songs From The Heart"" which I enjoyed as well."
3,DISAPPOINTING -- AND IT NEEDN'T HAVE BEEN,"Well, to begin: Only three Celtic Women sang on this recording, backed by an unnumbered but overwhelming chorus. If I wanted Choir Music, I would have ordered any number of other groups and would expect a choir performance.I loved Celtic Women when there were four, or even five Celtic Women singing without HUGE NUMBERS of backup singers. I think they have ""jumped the shark"" with these production values.Bring back the simple Irish lasses whose singing was good enough to stand by itself."
2,"Boring music, disengaged performances","I've watched all the previous Celtic Woman concerts on PBS (some several times) and have enjoyed them a lot. This one was disappointing enough that I stopped watching before the end. To me the musical numbers sounded practically indistinguishable from one another, and were musically boring. The performances also seemed more theatrical and less genuine than in other concerts, as if the singers were overly choreographed and weren't really engaging with what they were singing. (I do partly blame that on the boring stuff they were having to sing.)This is just one person's opinion, of course. But don't automatically assume that you'll love this if you've loved Celtic Woman's previous shows."
2,Dissapointing Song Selection,"This DVD was completely dissapointing. This from a Celtic Woman fanatic. The songs lacked any rhyme nor reason. I listen to all of their other DVDs on a constant basis during any relaxing moments. Enough that I'm probably an expert. Was looking forward to seeing them for the first time at an upcoming local concert, but will not be attending due to poor music selection on this DVD. Beleive me, this hurts..."
5,A great show!,I watched this one on PBS and can't wait for the DVD and the CD to be released. I have every concert on DVD that Celtic Woman has done and I have loved each and every one of them. I wish the reviewer that stated that the last DVD was an insult to the fans...well I just have to say that the reviewer doesn't speak for everyone! I didn't consider it to be an insult at all! Nothing Celtic Woman had done to date has disappointed me in either their performances or the quality of the DVD's.
4,Classy and entertaining,"Wonderful concert and the dvd has vivid color, however, the sound track has some noise. I enjoy the dvd anyway."
4,Makes a great gift!,I bought this last year as a birthday present for my mom. She loved it! She has watched them on TV before and now she can pop in the DVD anytime she wants.
3,not my favorite,"The music is good and the scenery and sets are good, but for some reason, this is just not my favorite of the Celtic Woman DVD's. I love the music and their voices, but if I want to watch Celtic Woman, this is not my first choice."
2,W.I.P in N.Y,"A WIP (Women in Prison) film set in New York in the mid-1980s, this film features all the 'big hair' of that era. This film is no different from as a dozen other WIP movies, such as ""Red Heat "" (with Linda Blair), only the location is different. The plots are all the same; a few backstories to show the brutal lives various women suffered before turning up in an even more brutal institution. Lots of sex with sadistic prison guards, and an eventual rescue.This film features some of the same cast, and even the same locations as another film made by the same director Tim Kincaid, in the same year; Breeders... this gives you an idea of the budget - and it looks like a budget movie"
2,Bad Films Dormitory,"This is available on a """"Women's Prison Drive In Features"" from Artists Entertainment Complex Films, and since I just had finished up ""Caged Heat (1974)"", I watched this too. This is a film that proves to be incredibly apathetic and inept at the same time. Bad Girls Dormitory is cinema at its most INTOLERABLE."
4,Amazing,This is an amazing book. I recommend this book to every woman who's ever struggled in life and to any woman who has a heart and compassion. The author explores so many deep/secret areas of her life and shares with the reader her experiences. The book is very touching and life changing. This is a must read for all.
5,Their Not Secret Anymore!,"Rachael dares to say things that most won't even think loud about for fear of being rejected, judged or even worse... She didn't just reveal the skeletons in her closet, she shoved them out and made them dance around for all to see so that they will never be able to haunt her again. This is an encouraging tell all book that helps the reader realize forgiving others is possible and forgiving yourself is a matter of life and death."
5,Heartwrenching Honesty!,"Couldn't put this down until I was done! Rachael's story is incredibly heartwrenching, and yet full of hope. I not only found myself admiring her honesty, but asking myself if I have the courage to do the same. It is certainly a bold move to face one's past; and as Rachael reveals, it is also a very liberating one."
4,Shining Light in the Dark Places of Womens Hearts,Rachael Weldon-Caron shows life altering courage by uncovering the painful situations that have occurred in her life. We have all gone through things in life that we would rather not discuss. We are content to let our past shame hide in the deep dark corners of our mind...slowly poisoning our lives. Rachel shines a floodlight in the places most would rather hide and by doing so helps readers to see that we are all the same underneath. Her candid memoir encourages acceptance of oneself despite life circumstances.
5,Mandy's Thoughts,The company responded to my call promptly and verified the needs for the order. The engraving was nicely done and the cuff links were received in a speedy manner.
4,Hats of to Doyle Bramhall ii,"Music is a great & wonderful thing! Recently, seems everywhere I turn, Doyle Bramhall ii is making it more wonderful. While listening to the track LISTEN I was forced to read the credits because I just HAD to know who wrote it, and sure enough, there was Bramhall's name! Boyd & Doyle - outstanding combination!"
2,"Too little violin, Too much horrible vocals","I love DMB, particularly Tinsley's contributions on violin, but he can't sing. Who told him he could sing? Boring, dull music. Please Boyd, stick to the fiddle."
1,Stick to playing the fiddle Boyd.,"Boyd you are one heck of a fiddler and are a great component to DMB. However, your voice is worse than William Hung's.Instead of covering Cinnamon Girl you should have tried your hand at ""She Bangs"" or Rocket Man."
1,Stick with Dave Boyd,"This album is atrocious. Boyd should stick to playing the violin for Dave, that's it. Not only did he have to suck it up for a whole album but he had to take down a great Neil Young song with him."
2,lost some inspiration,"If you are a fan of the passionate violinist in DMB & are looking to hear pulsing, powerful or even soothing melodys, save your money for the next live album! the album truly lacks true reflection and I definitly lost some inspiration when I threw it into my CD player. There is almost no violin & boyd sings an octave or two higher than he was born to. I am a big fan of Boyd tinsley but truly wasted time & money buying that album"
3,Boyd branches off to own creative music,not a bad album... however its not as good as the dave matthews badn of which he is a member... i do like his unique and creative style... and enjoy listening to the album... not a must have... but a quality album
2,"A nice start, but Boyd needs to showcase his playing","I picked up this album on a whim, since I'm a big DMB fan. I was disappointed by Boyd's lack of violin showmanship in ""True Reflections"", the less-than-stellar lyrics, and the rough-ish singing. With all the guest talent here, this album could have been fantastic. C'mon Boyd, you can do better than this."
4,So So - Fifty Fifty,"I have been a long time follower of Dave Matthews and the gang. I have enjoyed their music immensely over the years. Upon purchasing Boyd's True Reflections album I honestly did not know what to expect. I assumed it would be an instrumental album. Although this is a much different album than I expected it is pretty good. I am usually more the rocker type... but... hey, music is music and I enjoy all genres. My only suggestion to Boyd is to take a few singing lessons. ;) Heis voice is all right, but he's no Dave."
1,A cd that should have never been made.,"Now, don't think I'm just some angry dave matthews band fan or anything. That's not the case. The point is this CD is not very good in terms of musicianship, lyrics, replayment value, engineering and production value, pretty much everything.The song are all a sort of country/pop mixture. The real problem is the production of the cd. It sounds like it was recorded in the early 80's in a junky nashville studio.No disrepct to Boyd, he's a good fiddle player, but I'm afraid that's where the talent ends. The lyrics are all cliche'd, kitzchy type of stuff, with a lot of women ""oohing"" and ""ahhing"" in the background.All in all, I give it a 1 out of 10. Maybe Boyd was feeling stifled from just playing the fiddle in DMB, but this songs would be best sung in his living room by himself."
1,Disappointment,"I am a HUGE Dave Matthews Band Fan and believe Boyd Tinsley is an outstanding violin player. Therefore, I was very excited to learn about his new cd 'True Reflections.'The CD has only a few violin solos. In addition Boyd had the same voice and rhythm in 90% of the songs. It was a waste of time and money. I could not even listen to the whole CD; it made me sick."
2,Its a DMB member - Gotta have it....,"The music isn't all that great, but you still gotta get the CD because Boyd is a DMB member."
2,Putting aside the DMB connection...An Honest review,"OK...we all Know Boyd is a member of the Dave Matthews Band...thats great....now, PUT THAT ASIDE....hows he sound???..Truth be told..not that great! The songs don't really grab you..the musicianship is (for lack of a better term) stale...and the vocals????...well..a American Idol reject sounds better (I'm talkin try outs kids not the semi-final type). All and all adisapointing effort from a very musician...With that said...bringing in the DMB connection...the version of True Reflections that appears on Listener Supported is superior to the version on True Reflections. Also, if Tinsleywere not a member of DMB he would probably not been afforded the oppertunity to release this type of album..ie with him singing. Anyone who has seen them live knows the man cannot sing...maybe backup and even thats not always good."
3,A Little to be desired,"I would to say I was fairly excited about this album coming out. I love Boyd's violin playing and thought a solo album would be a great way to demonstrate his ablilty....not the case. I found that this album lacks the violin that many of the Dave Matthews Band fans have come to expect. Another aspect is the song writing, I think it was seriously overlooked. I think he was so amped about working with all the guests on the album that many aspects of the album got overlooked.The only notable tune on this cd is True Reflections. It's probably the most familiar tune to most fans.Overall I think this album was a disapointment. It could have been so much better. My suggestion is you buy a Sample's album with Boyd being a guest. On those albums he is definately at his best. Just my opinion"
4,An Apt Adaptation,"Melville's sometimes disturbing and creepy text gets a fine rendition, overall, in this 2000 Jonathan Parker adaptation. Crispin Glover is remarkable as Bartelby, and Glenne Headly is a fine boss.Some of the other characterizations, however, don't work quite as well. Neither does the dialog that isn't from Melville. But don't let the unevenness of the movie put you off. It is the kind thing that folks who like this kind of thing would prefer. Or not."
4,I would prefer not to!,"Great film, better than the 1970 version. C.Glover is perfectly cast as Bartleby. This version , unlike the 1970 film, is basically straight out of Melville's story! Almost word for word in some scenes. That's a good thing. The only weakness is the over involvement of Glenne Headley as the sexy secratary. Too much screen time in my opinion. David Paymer is perfect as the sympathetic boss and he and Glover work great together. The DVD extras are amusing, with cast inetrviews in character,(except Glover) ,his interview is for ""real"", but he's so quirky , you would think it was Bartleby himself talking. The Theremin soundtrack added a bit of strangeness which was good also. Buy this DVD, it's well worth it."
3,Crispin Is King,"Write a review about this film? I would prefer not to.P.S. The ""video"" to the song BEN with Crispin's commentary is worth the price of the disc alone. I s**t you not."
1,Possibly the worst adaptation ever,"The fact that such a movie dare be named after the wonderfully quirky Melville classic is sickening. Not only does this movie stray so far from the story that they seem barely related, but when it does decide to reference the story it is in spurts of random quotes as though the characters remove themselves from the role and are quoting poetry. Maybe, if the original story did not exist, then this film would be somewhat bearable. However, since it does, go out and read the story. It will take less time and actually, I dunno, make you think."
1,emil41,"I can't believe that I devoted ninety something minutes of my life to watch this garbage. I kept watching it, to see if something, anything, would happen. When it ended, I was relieved. I know of no special features on this disc as I couldn't get it out of my DVD player fast enough. I see absolutely no reason for this movie to be made. I thought that Tomb Raider II was a bad choice for a movie this weekend, it actually turned out to be the better (?) of the two. I can't believe that I actually had to give it a star. Why would anyone want to see something like this in the theater?"
5,...an amazing voice!!,"This cd is great!!! truly a country artist with emotion and compassion... HELP POUR OUT THE RAIN is truly a 5 stars hit.. this song was written about his daughter, and it is so precious.. THEN YOU COULD TELL ME GOODBYE has never been presented this well.... Buddy definitely gave new life to this old song.. I recommend very highly, getting this single, and I am looking forward to the forthcoming cd... GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Poor Intructional,"This is monkey do, monkey see intructional with very few key points and theory. This book is more like a collection of photographs you see in martial arts magazine, do this, then that and so on-nothing more. Very lazily put together book."
1,Machado? Who?,"First of all, who's Rigan and why haven't I heard of him in UFC or Pride? This book has nice photographs but who said anything about learning from photographs?For those of you who are fortunate enough to live nearby Gracie Academy in Torrance CA or up North by Shamrock's Lion's Den... don't even bother with this book."
1,Warning: Not for beginners!,"This book assumes that you already know the basic mechanics of BJJ and therefore, it jumps right into the techniques. This books could be used more as a reference to someone who has BEEN learning BJJ for sometime. This book is definitely not for the beginner. The explainations are very vague. A beginner would most likely execute the techniques improperly if not supplementing this book with an actual BJJ course. I would not recommend this for a beginner nor an advanced student."
3,"Not the best place to go, but good tid bits here and there.","Okay, really not the best book for learning Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. If you are starting from scratch avoid this book. It is only one sided and focuses mostly on the submissions, but there is much more to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu than submissions. That being said, it's cheap in comparison to other books, and if you already train, or own one of the better books the submissions here can add to your game. ..."
4,leg locks,"It has not nice pictures like Gracies' books but some useful techniques which are absent in their books, so it can complement them. In addition, the face of Machado may give you an inspiration for practicing harder, it is like seen Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Colombus developping their muscles in some basement without proper lighting, old jeans etc."
1,Save Your Money,"Like other reviews have stated, this book was a HUGE disappointment. The pictures are of poor quality and the descriptions are worthless. The way this book is setup it's impossible to capture any of the details of the moves. As anyone who has studied BJJ knows, the details are key.I wish I could get my money back for this garbage."
3,Good for a supplement,"This book is good for a supplement to what you already know. It is a great reference for lots of submissions. It also has a great section on no gi training. The one thing I think this book suprisingly lacks is a section on sweeps. I think the book would have been much more complete with such a section. I think this book is very good to own and can increase your skill with study. However, you still need to have a base knowledge of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to make up for the lack of explanation to the pictures. If you are looking for another good book on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu I would have to recommend Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Theory and technique. It was put together on a much higher budget and the amount of things shown in the book is definately influenced by this. Once again though Rigan's book is a good selection to add to your library."
1,not happy,"This product came to me with the package opened. I thought it was new. It worked about 5 minutes in my electric fence charger, then quit working. I am not happy with my purchase."
2,Destroyed by poor packing,"It is hard to rate what this lamp would have looked like if it had arrived whole. I opened the package to find uncountable shards of glass and no packing material (bubble wrap, peanuts, or crushed paper) in the box at all. The components had just been tossed in a large box and sealed up. This is my first instance of poor packing at Amazon and I am awaiting a refund, but I won't reorder."
5,great made cookware at a reasonable price,"The cookware purchased was to be used everyday in our home, and we really use it. With a family of seven the cookware is used several times a day with everyone cooking at different times. The cookware we were used to using was from pampered chef, and let me say that I thought it was good until the coating started to come off in our food. While shopping for cookware, we went to the county fair and watched a presentation on health craft cookware. This cookware seem to be the best for waterless cookware until they revealed the price at the end of the demonstration. Who in the hell has 3500.00 to spend on a set of cookware, I sure don't. The cookware set we found on amazon has been wonderful. I would recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a great set of cookware. The only problem I have with it is, it's not made in the U.S.A."
1,cannot rip to put on zen,"My husband purchased this cd for me for Christmas. It's been in my cart for an age, but is so expensive from Amazon that I'd held off on purchasing. So imagine my surprise when I popped it in the computer this afternoon to put the songs on my zen and discovered this particular disk is copy controlled. I can listen on my computer (quite imperfectly) or in my car cd player, but I can't listen to these songs while I exercise despite the fact that we paid upwards of $25 for what is billed as a CD, but really isn't. It's tempting to return it to amazon with a nasty note, but the music is quite good. I'll search out a friend with a Mac instead :-)"
1,Darn...,"What a waste of money, The only speed that works is ""MAX"" every other speed is so slow the fan doesn't move any air! The Speed Control is rated for 1.5A and the fan I have is brand new and only draws 1A. It works just fine on ""MAX"" but when you put it on ""HI"" the fan moves as fast as a carousel, I went to the hardware store and found a new speed control from a different brand, It costs more and had the same amp rating with one big difference, IT WORKED. I guess you get what you pay for, even though $20 is already a lot for a fan switch..."
1,unreliable,knob is too hard and stiff and difficult to turnalso if you go straight to medium setting it doesnt work- you have to first go to max and then dial downalso it interferes with other radiofrequency electronics such as dimmer cabinet lights in the room next door
4,I lke it. Fits in with my remodeled kitchen. Works well also. Great product.,Fits in with my newly remodeled kitchen. Works well also. Went right in my present junction box and fitsflush against the wall.
5,Great Childrens Books,The Author Bill Peet has the gift to spark the imagination of all children. His stories are amazing. There are over 30 kids books by him and I recommend them all!Smokey (Sandpiper Books)
5,Mom's Favorite,I never grew tired of reading this book to my children. Am sending copies to my nephews but I can't part with the original because it is my favorite.
2,Fairly One Sided,"I was quite annoyed after reading a few pages into the book. If one were to write about the ethical issues and problems that genetic engineering would induce, that person should be an expert at the matter, or better yet, have hands-on experience on it. I'm a neuroscience researcher at the Second ranking school in the nation. I understand how the mechanism behind this procedure and what we do as scientists; moreover, the guidelines we follow to prove ourselves as ethical as we can be. When it comes to genetic engineering, what is good for the individual is more important than what is good for the society. With that being said, genetic enhancement for personal advantage or desire is a questionable practice because it is the people's choice. This is America, isn't it? Are we all here because we believe in choices?"
3,Pretzel,Pretzel is so cute.He is so big and cute. He had four other siblings. Pretzel started getting wider and wider. He was the tallest dachund ever. Pretzel one his first award at a dog show. All the dogs and the people admired him. Only one dog didn't Greta. Greta didn't like long dogs. Pretzel was a hero after he rescued Greta. See Greta got stuck in a hole. Thanks to his long body he was a hero. Greta and Pretzel got married!
2,damaged product,"I love this story, but made the mistake of being a used product. The product that came did not match the description. The book had a half torn page. From now on, I will buy new."
2,"May be the creepiest story by ""Curious George"" authors.","Pretzel is born and nursed by his mother.Then he grows up. Or, long.He falls for a female daschund who would not accept his romantic advances.But she ends up happily awarding her behind in marriage after he rescues her from some deep hole.Finally, the female daschund gives birth and nurses the next generation of puppies.Must be a lesson most so-called ""Nice Guys"" learned in their childhood to doggedly go after girls who don't want them, pun intended of course."
5,Arrived on time,"Small book, but the recipient loved it. I have nothing left to say but this lamo review requires a certain number of words."
5,it's ok to be a little odd...,"This was my very favorite children's book, and as an adult, i still read it at least once every 6 months. it was out of print for a looong time, so kudos to holt for bringing it back. teaches kids that it's ok to look/be a little weird...that weirdness can be a real asset!!! just the best book."
4,Don't judge just by looks,"A very sweet story. We have 2 dachschunds so we could relate as I read the story to my granddaughter. The story teaches that it's important to be kind, and don't judge someone just by their looks. A nice ending. Good for children."
4,"Think of Holden Caulfield,","older and wryer and not the least bit jaded by all the sad strange beautiful horrendous stuff that happened to happen. That's the voice in a David Kirby poem. The Ha-Ha is Kirby's latest collection of really good stories, and when was the last time you smiled out loud while reading a goddam poem?"
2,"Ironic title, huh?","From the co-compiler of the Seriously Funny anthology, this is seriously not a LOL collection. Kirby styles himself a narrative poet but is more like a tedious after-dinner speaker; his limp anecdotes and self-satisfied ramblings are not helped by a lackadaisical approach to technique verging on the indifferent - result: monotony."
1,Annoying heroine,The heroine was really annoying. Her reason for not wanting to be with the hero seemed hallow and contrived. I barely finished the book.
5,A humanistic look,"Over the years, I have read much on the Sphinx. But this book was the first that actually believed he was human and not a god and took great pains to put a human face to the man. Given that he guarded his legacy and shaped it during his lifetime, we will never know the real man. But at least someone is trying to show us that he was human and had all the strengths and weakness of a man. For that, and only that, this book is invaluable. For those who only take interest in him because of the Hemmings controversy, you are missing out on so much. The political intrigue alone is worth reading this book."
1,Pure garbage; historical fiction,"How Ms. Brodie could be regarded as a serious historian is beyond me. Her version of Thomas Jefferson's life is nothing more than a poor work of fiction and should be categorized as such. Too many other real historians have actually done their research before setting pen to paper; scholars such as Henry Stephens Randall's The Life of Thomas Jefferson (fantastic biography), Dumas Malone's Thomas Jefferson (the six vol. set, not the one vol. abridged), and Merrill D. Peterson's Thomas Jefferson and The New Nation.Ms. Brodie's feeble account smacks of deep-rooted hatred. Don't waste your time with this trash. I am loathe to throw any book away, but I could not live with myself if I gave this copy to anyone.Brodie is not worthy of the one star rating I am forced to select if I wish to publish this review."
1,Absolutely Awful Revisionist Misrepresentation,"My title for this review says it in a nutshell. One star for being reasonably well written/edited. But, why are some of these authors so intent on trying to defame Jefferson by twisting history the way Jefferson's original slanderer, Callender, did? It is certainly not good objective history. I would not want to lead any young reader down the wrong path with this revisionist history based on weak, weak opinion and speculation."
1,"Fantasy, lurid psychobabble, twisted imagination but no history","The book's title: Thomas Jefferson, An Intimate History has no relation to the book's text. The author weaves a lurid and unflattering view of our third president by simply exerting unrestrained imagination. The tale told simply cannot be called history just tabloid stuff. History is based on ascertainable facts. The book is lacking on this regard. Skip this book and you will miss very little, that is, if history is what you are after."
2,Typical Brodie,"This book has all of the usual Brodie strengths and weaknesses. She wrote very well, and the biography is extremely readable. She almost always made unsustainable claims to know the inner mind of her subject. She seems to have been somewhat fixated on sex -- or on Freudianism, which may be worse -- and downplays other aspects of her subjects' lives that are very arguably more important (or, at least, are the aspects that make the subjects interesting in the first place).I can't recommend this book as a dependable biography of Jefferson. But it's a good read, and a great deal can be learned about Jefferson from it...."
1,A genuine waste of time,"I read this book only because a friend gave it to me as a present. It is little more than a soap opera account of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings. The author does not qualify as a serious Jefferson scholar. Thankfully, she is dead and can no longer encumber history with her swill."
2,Grasping at Straws,"My intense fascination with the Founding Fathers, and the birth of the United States finally lent me weight to pick up this book after having it 10 years unread.Brodie did a fantastic job with her research, and her thoroughness was self evident in the way she constantly cross-referenced where she could. She integrated with her writings Freudian speculations about Jefferson's writings, whoever they were written to. In my opinion, Brodie did a poor job to mix these with her factual biography, and it did much to detract from it. I don't believe this book gives an accurate account of Jefferson and his relationships.It gave a fantastic account of how Jefferson was politically, as Revolutionary, American Politicion, and later, Republican, but her personal portrayal of Jefferson, and her speculations of his psyche ultimately left me feeling she was grasping for straws."
2,A Relational History of Thomas Jefferson,"I am currently reading biographies for the Presidents of the United States in order. I selected this book due to its length, being a moderate read for only my third biography into this adventure. I did not wish to become overwhelmed too quickly by too long or tedious a book. I was truly disappointed in this biographjy as it did not cover any any serious depth his political decisions. This was an insightful biography strictly of his relationship throughout his life - with lovers, friends, enemies, etc. It detailed these relationships and gave insight into the reason these relationships were as they were. However, for someone interested in politics in general, and especially American revolutionary politics, this book was a real disappointment. I will have to find some time to read another Jefferson biography, perhaps a multi-volume one, to get that added depth."
4,Hard to find...,Good deal on a hard to find cologne... nice clean scent that is not overpowering for day or at work...
5,IT WORKS LIKE NO OTHER,"I had a very very bad roach problem that was not mine but my landlords due to water leakage from pipe problem (so he said) and read all the reviews up here for advice. I have tried everything baits, boric acid, gels , my own made paste, bombs, exterminator. These things was taking over that I was like if this don't work I have to move. Well it works I used a whole can I was on mission but I have not seen roaches it took about a week or two to see not any but that first night I saw a difference that I bought my landlord some for the basement and his apartment. I have never written a review for anything up here but had to for this to save others time and money..... It works it works it works !!!!!!!!!!!"
3,may be need time,i bought it n tried it 1 week before its not working untill now may be need time so cant say
5,GUD STUFF,I've used it b4 and I thik its the best stuff on the market. I see less and less problem daily
3,I am going to give it a try,"I have a very very bad phobia of insects. In the past three years I have seen seven cockroaches in my home. Yesterday, a cockroach was flying through my house. I used Raid Max spray, Hot spot and Home Defense Pest Control and a broom to kill it. Well, none of it worked. Except the broom stopped it from flying for a few seconds. It wasn't until I poured bleach on it that it died. Needless to say I now have bleach stains on my beige carpet. I called my mom and she told me about Roach Prufe. After spending a couple of hours researching its effectiveness and reading comments that were posted, I placed my order today. I am praying this product works because spending 150 bucks for Orkin to come out to the house in this economy is too much for me right now. I will keep you posted."
5,a real killer,living in the deep south one is never without roaches. Roach Prufe is one that really gets rid of the nasty things.
1,At least Roaches don't fear it,"This item didn't work for our home. On the other hand, we have to clean full house for this messy powder. :("
1,WASTE OF MONEY. Roaches don't react to it,I never do reviews but I jus had to...IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL .I LOST A FEW DOLLARS .save urs .
2,What a wasted opportunity,"With the arrival of the new 4 strokes and their magnificent sounding engines Duke video could have hit a home run with this DVD, but to my great dismay and frustration they struck out. Duke have yet another northern English sound alike in Jack Burnickle commentating. Not only does Mr Burnickle's droll delivery dampen any sense of excitement his voice is dubbed over the original audio with the resulting muting of the actual race sounds. Why can't Duke use a combination of Nick Harris, Randy Mamola and Dennis Noyes (at least for the American market)?. In addition the seismic shift from two to four strokes is given a scant 90 seconds in the introduction.Thankfully the visuals are good, otherwise I would have sent the DVD back to Duke."
1,Sound editing please,"You'll rally behind Rossi until you realize GP vet Alex Barros (2 stroke Honda) gave him fits by the end of the year. Barros is the man! The narration is boring yet classic old school English and for some crazy reason, they turned the motor noise down. Some sound editors just don't get it. This was the last year they ran two strokes.Rossi is one cool cat, Always check for his finish line antics. On one he sits up on the tank sideways and waves to the crowd.Also, check the consistency of these beautiful GP tracks around the world. Nothing like that here in the states. Why do we build these multi-million dollar NASCAR facilities just to watch young studs turn left?"
4,"If You Like Sun Ra & Arkestra, You Need This Too","I like Ra's music, in general, for his playing on Keyboards, and for the work of Gilmore and Allen.On the cut Silhouettes of the Shadow World, there is a break for Gilmore that literally sets my heart racing everytime I hear it. Some of Ra's thinking is lost on me, and I don't always make a spiritual connection to the music, even the stuff I love. That moment however, the long pinched arcs from the sax, endlessly cascading and then peaking again higher and higher; I feel it. It is a one soul trying to communicate with other souls. Wonderful. My first time hearing it was the first time I ""got it"".If you are looking to bond with Ra's music, this might be the one."
5,CLASSY TOUCH FOR MY COFFEE TABLE,"This statuette is a kind of seventies, kitschy piece - but ritzy-er."
5,i love it!,"i ran across this translation of the torah a few months ago. i've got a master's in religion, and i've had my nose in just about every torah and bible translation into english known to man. this is the very first one that i've ever had, ever, that was really a great translation. unlike earlier translations that have tried to capture every small nuance of the original text (impossible to do) or to translate 'word for word' as much as possible, rendering the final text impossible to understand, this translation renders the original intent of each verse into clear, modern english. i love it! the original texts have a story to tell, this translation allows them to do it in english. i think so highly of it, i've been tracking down mr. scharfstein's other works to see if they're this good too."
5,hilarious,"Maz is the Elvis of comedy and the Lady GaGa of standup! If you like to laugh - and face it, you do - this is the show for you. & You definitely don't have to be Persian or even middle-eastern to appreciate Maz - he'll crack your cracker a$$ up no matter what."
2,"Like Jobrani, but skip this...","I like Maz Jobrani a lot and find him to be an intelligent and funny comedian/actor. But I have to say this DVD was a major disappointment. Not only does it contain material that is redundant, but some of his jokes are just plain crude and stupid. Take a look at his stand-up acts on You Tube, skip this DVD."
1,Wrong Item,"The one star rating is not to reflect product quality but rather to express dissapointment. The solid color of the duvet set pictured is not what I received. Instead what arrived was a yellow duvet set with a large print of green vines and purple flowers, which I posted a picture of on the ""share your own images"" link. I called amazon.com and requested the item be replaced. Again I received the printed set and not the solid yellow which is shown on the page. I called amazon.com one more time and explained the situation. The response by the amazon.com representative was that there was a problem and I could return the item for a refund. I explained I didn't want a refund, I wanted the item I ordered which was on sale. She stated that there were no guarantees that I would get the item I ordered. Although I'm very happy with all of my numerous purchases from amazon.com this purchase and experience left a sour taste."
5,Very Compelling,"I don't think The Silent Angel is as fine a book as The Train was on Time. However, it is one of Boll's most sensitive books, exposing the pain and emptiness felt at the war's end, and demonstrating that there was indeed a future for those who survived."
5,Incredible,"This is a terrific translation. There is a wonderful economy of words here conveying the emptiness of being on the losing side of World War II and human ethos in the face of tragedy. A super-easy, super-powerful read."
5,There's a Hair in My Dirt! A Worm's Story,"Excellent book. I bought it for a science teacher friend and she loves it. It covers ecology, earth science, biology and is hillarious!"
4,Laugh-out-loud fun!,"I had originally intended to give this book to my best friend's 10 year old son, but I enjoyed it so much I'm thinking of keeping it for myself! While the text is informative and darkly humorous in its own right, the drawings are the most fun -- I especially loved the lightning bug! Maybe I enjoyed this book so much because I found it at a yard sale for 25 cents! Lucky me!"
4,Fun Story and Educational,"I did not know Gary Larson had a serious educational background in zoology but one might guess as his cartoons mostly involve animals. In this book designed for the younger reader (but informative for adults as well) his cartoon story gives a glimpse into the real dynamics of the animals and nature and the naive, often negative, impact humans have on their environment. There is a bit of macabre at the end. All very real!"
4,"Enjoyable, but probably not intended for younger kids","I enjoyed reading the book, in particular the small humorous details scattered throughout (ie: the eagle carrying the poodle to the nest, Harriet stepping on the ants she just praised) that gave me flashes back to both Larson's Far Side cartoons and the small Sergio Aragones cartoons sprinled in the margins of old MAD magazines.I had intended to read it to my kids (aged 7 & under), but I think the ending is a bit too creepy for those ages. (But I do think it's a perfectly fitting ending)."
5,Hilarious look at the world around us.,I was surprised at how I enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure what to expect from a book by Larson with an actual storyline but found myself laughing with the turn of each page.
4,"great art, but the story...","larson has written a book after a bit of an absence. the art is terrific. but the story...well, it isn't so good. i haven't yet decided on what age this book is intended (certainly not for adults). it is to simple for any half-decently educated adult. but i think it is a little too much for young children. maybe he meant this for 10-13 year olds. the tone of the book is a bit preachy. hopefully larson's next book will be a bit better."
3,I feel like I have been ripped off,"Although the message and drawings are delightfully classic Larson, the book should sell for under $5.00. The up side is that maybe it will encourage Larson to do more. END"
2,Eerie. Not at all what I expected.,"I'm a big Gary Larson fan, but I thought this book was a bit much, even for him. I understand the point he was trying to make (that is, 'tug at one thing in nature and you'll find it is connected to everything else'), but he was waaay too severe with driving it home, particularly that ending. This is not a bedtime story!On the other hand, if his goal was to set readers thinking about what we are doing to the environment, even with the best intentions, and how it may come back to haunt us, then touche'!Nevertheless, it gave me the willies, and I'm no hothouse flower."
3,"I'm disappointed, but he is still Gary Larson.","Larson's greatest strength is in ascerbic visual sarcasm. The sharpest jabs in this story are found in the action on the periphery of the illustrations, which is classic Larson. Nothing is ever straight-forward, and the punch-line is in what you don't see, not in what is obvious. His writing, however, needs work: the illustrations are perfect, but the story is preachy and overbearing."
3,Sour. Preachy. Boring. Yech!,"This is funny? It's mean! Foolish girl goes out, admires nature, and Gary Larson preaches at her. ""Flowers are beautiful? Feh! They're just sex maniacs!"" It's a one-unfunny-joke diatribe. Not for children, but unfortunately not for adults either. At least I bought it at the remainder table -- I'm sending it to the recycling bin."
1,Don't eat the hair,"1. This book tells about a string of hair in a young worms dirt, a very fat lady who loves nature and a bunch of ""facts"" on little critters. 2. I really didn't like this book, but I had to reed it for my bingo sheet. 3. The setting of my book is in the dirt and on a path in the woods. 4. I recommendatend this book to any one who likes Fantesy Fiction."
5,Excellent book!! Two thumbs up!!,"Gary Larson has wrote a masterpiece!! This is his best work yet. Not only is it delightfully entertaining, it's educational. The book ""There's a Hair In My Dirt!,"" has all the beautiful illustrations we are used to of his. I recommend this book to everyone who loves nature, or is a fan of Gary Larson's brilliant work. This is the best book Iv'e ever read, you'll never be able to stop laughing!!"
4,More of the same from Larson (thank goodness!),"This parody of a children's story features a worm family, a young maiden and Gary Larson's twisted sense of humor and love of science. The illustrations are great, filled with little ""Far Side"" scenes as well as a larger storyline. If you are a fan of ""Far Side"" you know that Larson is a master of one panel, one-liner jokes. He can also use his twisted sense of humor and love of science in a larger, ongoing plot as well.Be prepared - this is a quick read. It took me about 15 minutes. Also, it looks like a little kid's book (K-3), but it is not. There are language and thematic issues that you should be aware of before handing it to your first-grader. On the other hand, your middle schooler will love it!"
5,Nature From A Different Perspective,"I absolutely love this book! While this book is written in the manner of a children's book, the story and illustrations are true Gary Larson/Far Side fare meant for a sophisticated reader. (It would probably be appropriate for late middle schoolers and up who can appreciate the irony.) If you're looking for a book that is part science and part fairy tale told in a dry humorous manner, you won't be disappointed. This story definitely presents nature as it really is and will poke a hole in the bubble of any tree-hugging Pollyanna out there."
4,How to date the right way?,"This is a useful counter-cultural apporach to intimacy where sexuality confuses the whole bonding process. Popular culture suggests that great sex is all that is required to have a successful loving permanent relationship. Hopefully, thoughtful people and professionals are beginning to fathom that we have been lying to ourselves. This book is a nuts and bolts approach to what construes a healthy relationship and approach to building. Essentially, too much time alone too soon will lead to tears.Recommended as a hands on approach to those wrestling with the pain of premarital sex."
3,A good book sure,"Purchased this book for my then teenaged daughter. She hasn't given me much feedback on it. That's the reason for the 3 stars. I'm waiting for her to give the book back to me so I can read it myself and do proper, more thorough review. Although I haven't read it, I don't think I will be disappointed because any book on the subject become too close, and too intimate in a teenage relationship has to be good. Stay timed for my personal review as mother."
5,Excellent - a great resource for students and history lovers,"This book has something for everyone. From before America was America to the present day, history comes alive in the words of those who were there. This book preserves history so that when no one is around to say, ""I was there,"" someone will be able to hold up Eyewitness to America and say, ""These people were, and this is what happened.&quot"
5,short story book,"This is a wonderful book. I actually had to purchase one of these for my History after 1877 college class and paid a substantial amount more at the college bookstore. The stories are short, most not over 3 pages and some as short as a half a page. They are told by the people that were there at the happening of certain things in hisory. I have always cringed at the history word but this book even got me interested. I bought this one for my brother who loves history but doesn't love to read. He seemed excited to get this."
4,History book,The book arrived in perfect condition. It was bought as a gift for my daughter who is a history buff.
4,Subjective Evaluation,"The arguments are, as stated in 1st review, slanted. They are supposed to be! The book uses a pro vs. con argument format and tries not to judge. Summary is limited to a mild discussion of the importance of the issue. I was required to use it in an education course and actually kept the book. I was looking for an updated version when I stumbled here, although in education as in all things it seems that the more things change the more they stay the same. I think that anyone, and I mean anyone, who intends to use public media to deliver opinions of any sort on education should be required to read the book."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"If you don't like Celine Dion, you probably won't like this. I really liked Helene Segara in Notre Dame de Paris, but this album is just so-so in my opinion."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,"This is just the album that I always wanted. I love this CD more than all my other CD's I have, if you are an Alizee fan, or Mylene Farmer fan, then you will definitely be Helen Segara's BIGGEST FAN!!!!!All the tracks in this album are just GREAT!!!"
4,elle est une chanteuse avec une voix belle,"I heard of Hélène Ségara when a classmate in my french IV class brought this cd in. I haven't heard the entire album yet, but I'm sure it's really good. I'd buy it the moment I get the chance to."
5,The Power of Romance.,"Helene Segara's latest album is probably one of the most successful French albums. After her success in Notre Dame De Paris, ""Au nom d'une femme"" is a good attempt to continue her popularity. The 1st single ""il y a trop de gens qui t'aiment"" which is a melancolic song, was a big hit in France. Nearly all tracks in the album are ballads. My favorites are : ""Elle, tu l'aimes"", ""Tu vas me quitter"" (probably will be the most succesfful song from this album), ""Mrs.Jones"", ""Dites-moi que je suis"", ""Parlez moi de nous"".....each listener will find a meaning from the 12 tracks.Worth to buy!"
5,Jazz For Kids CD Rock!,My 10 month old starts bobbing her head whenever I just point to cd player. She can't wait for the Old MacDonald song to begin. I love this CD. You will too!
5,Awesome JAZZ for Kids,This is a great CD to introduce your kids to jazz. I have given this as a gift to many children (I've even had one Mom tell me that if I didn't 'tag' this as my gift of choice - she would!) We listen over and over again.
4,Not as dirty as the title would make it seem,"Sure it does have nudity and the obvious sex scenes, but its not as bad as you would think. It's actually a really funny movie that is more about friendships and relationships than a good old fashioned orgy."
4,Hilarious,"Just rented and watched this and I gotta say, I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes to laugh. I love movies that are quotable and this is definitely one of those. It's got boobs, tons of alcohol, sex fetishes, and alot of partying... ooh and even a little girl-on-girl action! Everyone plays their part very well. You won't be disappointed."
4,good movie,"this movie is pretty good if you enjoy comedies. great actors and actresses. good friends, fun times, and a orgy... what else could a movie ask for. :)"
2,By no means a good movie,"""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" aims for Judd Apatow territory, sweetness leavened with breezy vulgarity, but it mostly just falls flat. For a while it is saved by the low expectations the title engenders: the dialog isn't stupid, the cast all turn in reasonable performances (though only old pro Lin Shaye and Jack Black impersonator Tyler Labine really register), and nothing is as juvenile as it could have been. ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"" is aimable, but it doesn't make you laugh, so what's the point? Still, there is something heartening about what is nominally a romantic comedy not punishing its characters for wanting sex. The orgy of the title leads to complications and hurt feelings (otherwise there'd be no movie) but not to a stock conclusion in which everyone learns that sex with anyone other than a True Love who is The One is a character flaw that must result in comeuppance and heartbreak. In this way, this mediocre trifle becomes accidentally subversive."
3,Kinda Blu,"Blu Cantrell is one of the best R&B singers in the buisness, and just when I thought she left the scene she comes out with Bittersweet. However, I saddly would have never known about this album if she wouldn't have gone on Carson Daily Most Requested, a top 10 countdown on our local radio station. So as I skimmed through the store I found this cd and bought it.I popped it in my cd player, and right from the get-go I knew this was going to be a mediocre album. I Love you is great, along with Sleep In The Middle, Impatient, Don't Want To Say Goodbye and a few others, but most of the songs are just weak. Such as Happily Ever After, ""Happily Ever After/ Let's start a story chapter"" is kind of a pathetic chorus.Another flaw is that the ONLY single got close to no radio play at all. The album had no weight behind it. I really hope this isn't the end because Blu is worth so much more."
4,BLU CANTRELL IS ONE OF A KIND,"I love this CD. I wish that people would sit down and listen to it. I think a lot people didn't like this CD because these days, people are into all this ""hip hop"". This CD is the bomb and it should've been promoted. I saw no promotion for this CD at all. Blu has a powerful voice and the look to match. So what if she took pics for playboy? This girl is one of the many entertainers that are so talented and don't get any recognition."
2,Not as good as So Blu,"I bought this album because I loved the first one ""So Blu"". But to be honest despite Blu's amazing voice this album just isn't where it's at. The only hot track on the album is ""Breathe"", ""Risk It All"" & ""Sleep In The Middle"" are the only other two reasonable tracks on the album. You'd be better off getting ""So Blu"" as it is a far more superior album."
3,Blu is now my favorite color,"Blu Cantrell has the strongest soul voice i have ever heard. I personally think her voice is a God-sent gift. I can't brag on her songs as much as her voice though. I think she just needs to hook up with the right producers(Missy, Timbaland, Neptunes) and everyone favorite color will change to blu. Everyone this cd isn't a disappointment I think her voice can make anything sound good. The cd has it's good points and it's bad points(mostly good) like every other cd. So I would recommend this cd to people so they can be mesmerize by blu's voice as I have"
2,A buy.... but only if you must.,"Not the worst R&B I've ever heard, but she's no Billy H., or even Erykah B. Something is missing here but it's difficult to say exactly what. This album is technically proficient, yet lacks the sexual subtlety or painful authenticity of a really great musical work. If your looking for either of these qualities, then go try Billy's stuff. Buy this to bop your head, but buy Billy to blow your mind."
3,Blu Cantrell,"One of the only Female singers in Randb today who can really sing I think she is better than Beyonce or Ashanti two other singers who sell more records and have higher profiles.on the album I agree her debut was a stronger album but I love a few songs here Breathe is the single and very catchy,but I think the record company made a mistake by not releasing I Love You as a single very catchy song and great singing by Blu.the other songs are not that good so I say make a tape with the first album and these two songs or If you can get it cheap make a mix tape of the good songs.oh stop putting Blu down for being a little fat in the booty I for one love women with some junk in the trunk."
1,it's...okay,"blu cantrell has a spectacular voice...true. but, the idea that this is a solid album in any way is false. the ballads are boring and cheesy (except for sleep in the middle) and the upbeat songs provide little emotion or energy. her collaboration with li'l kim and fat joe is unnecessarily rough, and is a meandering excuse for a song. Ultimately, the only saving grace of this cd is blu's voice, which is only fully displayed on ""sleep in the middle"" and muffled throughout the rest of the album. this cd is mostly bitter, and rarely sweet."
3,Blu Cantrell Is Sweet From The Heart,"Blue Cantrell sings from a typical woman's standpoint when it comes to love and relationships. When she sings, her emotion is from around the way like Mrs. Evelyn Jenkins who lives in Apt. B-12 and Jackell Thompson who is going to college to pursue Sociology. It's just real, not manufactured to be real.""Sleep In The Middle"" speaks from emotion on behalf of being alone and wanting someone next to you. ""Unhappy"" speaks from emotion on behalf of being in a relationship where you aren't seen to be worth the time or existence to be in. ""Impatient"" speaks from emotion on behalf of being horny and emotionally sprung where as though you need love and something to satisfy your existing need. ""Make Me Wanna Scream"" speaks from emotion on behalf of being tired of dealing with drama and stress. You just feel damn tired.Soulful, sultry, and down to earth Blu Cantrell is."
5,Don't Be Fooled,"I am giving the VOICE 5 stars. The CD gets about 4 1/2. Don't let that light skin and centerfold sex kitten image of Blu fool you. She not only can sing, she has a powerful voice. More R & B (a little less hip hop) and a few more tightly written songs and you would have to put her next to Kelly Price in your collection. Some would still say she belongs there now. And really, the CD is good too! The listening samples here do not do it justice. Trust, there is no one on the r&b/hip scene today who can touch this voice! She even has legit jazz skills!"
3,Good Good Good,"Blu Cantrell is one of many decent r&b artists about there, she got a good voice and her we can hear that she's clearly jazz influented too. After hearing the hit single ""Breathe"" with Sean Paul i thought most songs would be those uptempo tracks but no, most are actually slow r&b songs with a few exceptions. She teams up with Fat Joe and Lil Kim on ""impatient"" and with Inner Circle's Ian Lewis on ""Make me wanna scream"" a song like many other these days with indian samples. It's not that she needs and guest artists but it somehow spice here career up a little. ""Happily ever after"" is one of my favorites, a good soul song where she proves her talent, it's brave to not make so many commercial songs on the album though, you get the feeling they came from the heart. Blu is simply one of the best r&b artists of her generationa and i hope for a even better album in the future, but this is a good start."
3,"More Like ""SwEeT & sOuR""","""Bitter Sweet"" by Blu Cantrell is not what i excpected. I was reading reviews on her and everyone was saying the album was woth buying, But then I heard it and it was wack!!! I didn't like it it was terrible. The only reason i gave it 3 stars is 'cuase i only like the songs ""Breathe"", ""Sleep In The Middle"", ""Unhappy"", ""Impatient"", ""Risk It All"" and ""Let Her Go""! The DVD says it's ""TELL ALL INTERVIEW with Wendy Williams"" but she doesn't say $#!^ about anything. Wendy tells her something, she says ""Lets not go there"" or ""I Don't Wanna Say Anything"" your better off buying Mya's ""Moodring"". Don't spend your money...I'd rather download..."
4,Impressed,"With the right PR peeps in her corner, she can hang around longer that she did with her first single from her previous album ""So Blu"". This album definitely shows off her ever ranging voice and production on the album is stellar... Definitely one of those cds you can listen to from beginning to end..."
5,BLU YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN,Oh......my........Gosh. This has to be the R&B album of the year. Blu you brought the falvor gurl. I love every single track.All I have to says is. Buy the CD.
5,This is nice!!!,"I enjoy listening to this CD. It is more R&B-oriented, despite the collaborations with Sean Paul, Lil' Kim, etc. I look forward to hearing Ms. Cantrell sing at a show (hint, hint)."
5,A wonderful book,"I borrowed this book from our local library and then I just HAD to buy it. It has great ideas for borders, and how to work them out, plus tips galore!"
5,MADANAT,"very, very good book. Gives a lot of ideas and inspiration! I am very pleased that bought it!"
1,Be Wary,"Before you buy this book for your loved-one, you should be aware that it is full of Satanic images. The children gather together in the haunted house with the ghost of the boy who commited suicide there. They cast a mystical circle complete with candles, tarot cards, assigning each child a suit and an element. They work together to conjure spirits and ""energy"" from the house. Oh, okay, they use the energy to help the girl and her battered mother; but....she doesn't get out of the abusive situation at the end of the book. She is left to rely on the ""energy"" they were able to channel to mom and her ghost boyfriend. My daughter and I had a long talk after this book. I have never censored her avid reading before, but I'm really glad I took a look at this book and was able to open a discussion regarding the dangers of playing around in The Beautiful Side of Evil. ( Now, that's a book to check out.)"
5,enjoyable science fiction short stories,"This anthology consists of ten science fiction stories previously published in Asimov or Analog written by women starring a female protagonist. The tales display how female authors have more than just contributed to the genre, but pioneered it while liberating writers to go beyond the limits of the past. Each story is well written as expected from a group of authors like this collection contains. Regardless of your gender, if you enjoy science fiction short stories you will gain much pleasure from much of A WOMAN'S LIBERATION.Harriet Klausner"
5,A writer Like No Other,"If I were to meet Mr. Helprin and could ask him one question, it would be, ""What writers have influenced your work?"" For his writing, his style, his tone, are like no other writer's. His style is aesthetically exquisite. The author's voice pours through his work and delivers to the reader something fresh, a sense of morality, of honor, of respect and light. I love his work because it is unusual, different from any other fiction I have ever experienced."
3,I expected much more from Mr. Helprin,"Ever having since discovered Mark Helprin through Winter's Tale two decades ago, I have not missed a word. I so looked forward to this collection, but when I was finished, I felt empty. I cannot recall a single story or character. Nothing captured me like Helprin's earlier works. We long to feast on the words of certain authors. Helprin is on my list, but this wasn't even a snack."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I can't believe this book is rated highly. The writing is pretentious, overwrought and, at times, so off-base that I wonder if the writer ever knew anyone like the characters he attempts to portray. Helprin is out of his depth here."
5,Short Story Masterpieces,"Mark Helprin holds your attention, draws you in, and puts you right in the middle of the story. On pages 321-328, as Charolotte's father is brought to his knees by gunfire on the battlefield, you will be inside his mind as tender memories of her sweep through."
1,Not So Good,I've been waiting years for the DVD and finally it came. I had to send it back. The sound was terrible with what sounds like time-code breaking through. The picture was OK. It's interesting that the cover shows photos which have nothing to do with the video. Wrong guitars and electric guitars. It was broadcast in the UK and I recorded it but my VHS is rather hissy. There is no excuse for the terrible quality on the DVD. The UK DVD by the way has a totally differant cover which also has nothing to do with the video. It shows what the company really thinks of it. But then why go to the expense of realeasing it when you don't really care. Illogical.
1,Returned- Source code incomplete,"The source code on the site is incomplete. When they're ready to provide the full source promised in the book, then it may be worth a look. Wrote the author to find out about the missing source. Not surprisingly he didn't respond. Pass."
4,Great book to learn,I've been online looking for information on 3D math. There are many sites available. The problem I had was that I had to go to many different sites to learn bits and pieces.This book lays out the foundation for 3D math in a clear and concise manner. The book is highly readable and the content is great.
4,Jaruwan Mesit,"This book does a great job at providing you into the underlying concepts of some pretty difficult concepts. What I like about this book is that it explains everything first in basic mathematical terms, derive equations, and show the examples as the contents of the book go. Illustration shows you visually what is happening. The main contents of the book are conceptual. Examples of the code are in C++ and are provided in a few special chapters. These are included to show a programmatic interpretation of those concepts."
5,"Excellent Book, Rush to Buy","This is a great book. It explains very complex 3d math problems in very simple terms with great illustrations. This is one of the few math books , that I could understand entirely including all the equations in one read. It is very rare.I highly recommend this book, to any graphic programmer, cs major, ee major, hobby game programmer, iPhone developer. This should be the first book you should read. Anyone can call the functions in OpenGL or DirectX but to know what is actaully happening underneath or why it is happenening is very essential , otherwise you will be ""Lost in Space"", 3d space!!!!"
3,Not for Novices or Intermediate,"Not an easy read. I thought of myself as being an intermediate level mathematician - leaning slightly towards the novice, but this was beyond my expectations. After the first few chapters on Vectors, getting into Matrices he lost me. Even some of the vector math lost me. Sure, if I want to find the cross product of two 3d vectors I can do it, I'd just go look up his source code, but *why* it works exactly? Don't know.I don't think the examples were quite clear enough. I would have preferred a much more thorough explanation of what the author was doing throughout most of his work (proofs, examples, just about everything).If you have a pretty good background / understanding of linear algebra, go ahead and get this book, you'll probably learn a lot - the author definitely knows what he's talking about - he's just not the greatest at explaining it."
2,Below average,"Although helpful in visualizing many of the concepts and making much of the linear algebra accessible I would have to say it is in no way worth the $50.00 cover price. It is rife with errors, many of which are not acknowledged in errata on the book web site. I found myself grasping some topics much more clearly by visiting web sites dedicating to tutoring the subject. In one howling error the book states the minor of a matrix is a matrix value. I find multiple sources on the web that contradict this. They say the minor of a matrix is the _determinant_ of a matrix value. It may seem esoteric but it is important and I think it is a function of a rush to press that another reviewer conjectured. If anything pick this up at a deep discount and don't rely on it solely."
2,Great Coverage in Some Areas Fail Miserably in Others,"The book is meant for Introductory to Intermediate audiences, but some of the chapters makes too many assumptions that you have background in the topic. Take the chapter on Vector, for example, it dives right into vectors without telling you how vectors are derived. Moreover, I believe the author takes a very lazy approach to his examples. He offers very little illustrations and explanations to demonstrate the problem. When he does offer it, he tends to skip a number steps before arriving at the answer. I do not recommend this book for Beginners; perhaps Intermediate users may find it more informative. Too bad Amazon does not reimburse for shipping returns; otherwise, it will be awaiting at their front door."
4,Great for Sensitive Scalp,"I found this shampoo initially at Walgreens. I love it! I have psoriaisis and sensitive skin so I rotate this and my medicated shampoo and it keeps things under good control. Its a bit expensive, but so far, this is the best (and non-smelly) product I've used for this condition."
2,No Results Yet,"I hope this will send psoriasis into remission. I have used it very little, however. So far no results."
5,Free & Clear Shampoo,A life saver product to say the least. I am very very pleased and will be using indefinitely due to new allergies. Thanks Free & Clear....
5,Great!!,I love this shampoo for my son. He has eczema and can not use most products. This one does not bother his skin at all and it cleans his hair great. It only takes a small amount so it last for awhile.
2,Free and Clear shampoo,I was disappointed. Refreshing tingle and smell but left a residue on my scalp --- the opposite of what I expected.
2,Tough and reliable,Other sites offer better coupler leashes! I got triple coupler and it's great. I think I got it for 12 bux or something. It's awesome. No heavy metal like this one. Used to be 5 stars. Went down to 2 sorry
2,BIG DOGS ONLY!!!!!,"I should start by saying the product arrived as promised, intact and as shown.However, amazon needs to regulate sellers ad's better. The description reads as a universal dual lead.This product is for large 15- 20 llb plus dogs only. I have 2 Yorkshire mini terriers and they can hardly pull the connection along let alone walk properly.Not a faulty product, but should be a much clearer advertisement."
3,Well made but heavy,Coupler seemed very well made and sturdy but so much metal made it too heavy for my two ten pound dogs.
3,Okay for some dogs - maybe,"Purchased to allow my wife to walk two dogs on one lease without tangling. Did not work for 4 year old male Shiba Inu and 7 month old mixed breed rescue pup. The pup was constantly getting tangled with larger Shiba. Purchased Xtreme Super Coupler Short Bungee for two dogs, much better solution."
2,Didn't work for us,"This is a good quality product it just didn't work for us. Our dogs just both like to sniff different areas of the grass and when they would do this the bigger dog would pull the other one even when he was going potty. The only real complaint would be that it doesn't adjust real good for different sized dogs. When you do adjust it the bigger dog can't really go side to side cause the tether is to short, or he drags the smaller one even more.But we gave it 2 stars cause the quality is good :)"
2,Adjustable Latch Broke After Two Weeks,"After two weeks of daily walks with two 15lb dogs, the adjustable latch broke; the pins that hold this in place are flimsy, and the top latch simply popped out and fell off in somewhere on the trail. When the latch worked, it was great; it comes in handy when you need to walk through a tight or populated area. But once the latch is broken, there is nothing from stopping the coupler leash from sliding back and forth through the attachment to the extendable leash, making walking two dogs very difficult. You'll wind up with one dog with a much longer leash than the other."
3,Was useful.,"I used the 1st Canadian edition all through university. It was very helpful. I favour online sources now so I don't use the book anymore. Having said that, this handbook still has much to teach and the content is top notch."
2,Good book - not in a good form,"I ordered the book and received at the anticipated time. The book by itself is really good, and definitely compact; however, some papers were not properly bounded and they wouldn't last on the book for a long time. So, I returned the book and got the noncompact version and I am happy with that."
4,great product,"good product. has different page numbers because of the exercises. other than that, its a good investment."
2,Had to buy it for a class i was taking,"I guess the book has a lot of information, but you are required to look in several different places to find a subject you need information on. In other words, this is not a very good reference book. If you need a book on grammar then I would suggest ""English Grammar For Dummies"".Sigh... maybe I'm just a dummy."
3,Never actually used it in class,It was a required book for class but I never even took it out of the wrapper... Buy it if you are actually going to use it.
4,The access code,"I have bought the new one. But I do not know why I cannot find the access card with the code. The website of the CompLab says ""If you purchased a new textbook, look for the access code inside the first few pages of the book or in the printed access kit that is shrinkwrapped with the book."". So just please tell me how to get the code. Maybe I didn't look for the right way. Thanks."
3,The book was in good condition when I got it a month later,"Shipping took a month, not good when you need it for class. The book was in good condition though, no markings or bent pages. It was cheap as well, so good enough."
2,"Refined singing, but the voice is an acquired taste","Ian Bostridge is a phenomenon, the darling of British critics and one of the few lieder recitalists today who can fill arnegie Hall. I've heard him there and on CD, and I don't get his enormous appeal. Usually when you dislike an artist revered by almost everyone else, it's best to keep quiet, but I must say this hooty, small voice with its limited range, along with Bostridge's precious underlining of every word, is so off the mark that I have to register a complaint. There is much refinement in his singing, and an admirable dramatic commitment, but none of that seems like adequate compensation. Now everyone can go on enjoying themselves, apparently."
3,Way to much info...,I wanted to give this book 4 stars but it's just information overkill in my opinion for the new christian. There were some GREAT gold moments in this guide don't get me wrong but other parts really draged on. Maybe I read it to fast. I'd say this is a good book but would b hesitant recomending it to the very new christian. I'm truly sorry if I offend with my negativity but I need to be honest.
2,Not really essential,"Now I love the Clash as much as anyone else, but this DVD isn't really needed. THey made some of the greatest records of all time, but they never really made great videos. More interviews and live performances would have been nice, and the inclusion of the late, great Joe Strummer's short film is a welcome addition, but I would recommend that you just buy the studio albums over this DVD>"
3,Not A Good Intro To Arthur's Work. Get the Whole CD Instead,"Joseph Arthur is by far one of the most challenging and innovative songwriters today. He creates music that cannot be easily categorized and certainly not easily dismissed. His lyrics touch upon the heart of everyday existence and hit the mark every time. ""Chemical"" is a single from his ""Come To Where I'm From"" (2000) album, which is one of the best albums of the year. ""Chemical"" is more poppy than anything else on the record. It's a great song, but not one of the album's best. The only reason to buy the single is the get the two b-sides: ""Heavy Bullets"" and ""Ask the Dust"" which aren't available elsewhere. I suspect that only die-hard fans will buy this CD, and I suggest that this is probably for the best. Pick up ""Big City Secrets."" Then, if you fall in love with Arthur's genius, go for the rare b-sides that only a tried and true fan could love."
3,4 movie pack.,just a batch of good movies. Enjoyed it. For the most part the screen plays did a pretty job of letting us see the book
5,From one Maestro to another,"Another gem by the great Joao Donato. This time he picked 14 songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim, wrote some of the coolest horn section arrangements, went to the studio with his trio and once again it was pure magic. 14 songs for $6,99? Is this a bargain or what?"
4,"Wonderful screen, one dead pixel","My husband bought this for me because it's supposed to be one of the best screens on the market, as far as quality and color goes (he did a lot of research). This is true. It's great on the eyes, and if you spend a lot of time writing papers or working on documents, the squarish (i.e. not wide screen) size of the screen is great, because you see a lot of your page. You can also adjust the height really well, and the screen is quite compact, so it does not take up much space on a desk. I can't comment on technicalities, but as an amateur user, this works very well. One star off for a dead pixel which appeared three weeks after delivery. This is not really a problem for me, as I can't see it most of the time, but should be mentioned."
4,"Memorable, affecting and real","I'm in complete disagreement with the other review here, in that Until Your Heart Stops is one of the strongest adolescent-centered novels I've read in years. The language is well-crafted and genuine and the characters, especially the teens, are vivid in the dramatics of their feelings. This should be on the reading list of anyone interested in adolescent development, though it seems like novels as unsterotypical as this one are becoming harder to find. Try A.M. Homes' ""Jack,"" and Brian Hall's ""The Saskiad,"" too."
2,A Pompous author fails,"TM Mcnally's first novel reflects a certain pompousity and foolishness. It is definetely not worth reading. His characters are shallow incoherent blurbs, vignettes, and when the narrative as a whole is viewed after stepping back, it becomes clear what waste the book truly is. While serious works have been successful when following the line of young suicide (largely what this book is superficially about) this particular re-telling plays like a child's writings."
5,ashutosh is greatness,Varshney's research is compelling and interesting. He offers refreshing insight and hope. His model will influence public policy and his writing will be cited by world leaders. I look forward to seeing his work implemented globally.a must have...
1,Half baked truths and desultory handling,"I started reading the book with a great hope that this gives a insight of what makes the south asian polity a voilent and irresponsible. The book fails to ooze the interest in the strict sense too.Reader is left aghast with where the conclusion leads to. You can be caught unawares with insipid portrayal of events that led to the bloodbath. A comparative analysis was remarkably absent making it a hackneyed attempt to divide a wedge among the intellectual community.It could be rather gratifying if the author could treat this subject in academiocal point of view after miserably failing in portraying the narration.Albeit all this lacunae, remarkable tendency to sensationalize the events to throw the reader into shocks, which only end up the reader jittery and wary of the intent of neo-communist diaspora.My half a cent to this -regards"
2,"Not especially good, but not horrendous either","I was actually looking for a book about Sawney Beane, and thought that this was one. It turned out to be a play with little to do with anything that actually occurred in reality. I read through it anyway, and it was not really worth reading. With all the possible philosophical points that could have been dealt with when dealing with the Sawney Beane family, Nye manages to ramble on incoherently about blood and bones instead.Overall grade: D+"
3,Home terrain,"Well, Menuhin rather disappoints. On the other hand, I don't know how Grapelli played Beethoven's A major violin concerto? Gotcha?"
4,Music,"Hi I am always looking for ""new"" music. My music tastes have a wide range from Vangelis to Congo tribal songs. Hope you will look for this for your collection. happy hunting..TR"
3,This was an experiment,"I knew I liked a bit of ragtime, but I think it turns out I just like Scott Joplin. Still a fun CD to have around to perk up a gloomy day."
2,Don't expect much from this one,"This book tries to cover Spanish for Health Professionals from the receptionist to the Doctor/Dentist. It does not adequately cover any of these areas. It tries to teach by showing the reader a conversation, but it goes no further. It has no discussion of common phrases or grammar, and the conversations are too situation specific. It does have a list of colors, months, numbers, etc. in the back of the book. The software portion is more of the same. I have limited knowledge of Spanish, and bought this book for a medical trip to Peru and found it to be practically useless. I would recommend spending your money on a good dictionary or phrasebook, or looking into some of the Spanish language software that is available."
5,Useful and practical,"A great buy. This book and CD does not make any reference to grammar, these are strictly many hours of listen and repeat drills that help you with your pronunciation. I learned a lot with the CD, now I speak more Spanish at work and they understand me! I give it five."
3,Spanish for Health Professionals,"It's an OK book. However, more coverage needs to be involved with mental health issues, because of my interest in it professionally."
4,"Very nice, early eighties, electronic music from Netherlands.","Nova was a Dutch electronic music band, the ""commercial"" branch of Peru group. By 1982 they reached the number 1 position in the Dutch Hitparades with a song called Aurora. Later then, they scored another hit called Sol. The group consisted of keyboard players and programmers Ruud Van Es, Rob Papen and Peter Kommers. All songs are composed by them, some together with producer Chris Pilgram, and performed using almost all kinds of Roland and Korg devices: synthesizers, sequencers, rhythmcomposers, vocoders etc.Their music, although not very complex, have, indeed, a high level of sophistication, demonstrating their skills on performing all these instruments and devices.A carefull listening will reveal some good influence coming from Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis.The first five songs are from their 1983 album called ""Quo Vadis"". The remaining ten are the full 1982 album called ""Terranova"" which included the above mentioned hits."
4,Interessante!,"Questa versione dell'Op.3 è molto interessante,ma non è quella di riferimento.Per coloro che vogliono una sola versione di quest'opera,dovrebbero comprare quella eseguita dall'Accademia Bizantina su Arts,in SACD se possibile!"
4,Exciting renditions if sometimes wayward,"This set is not without the usual eccentricities of Biondi but it's not too crazy and overall provides enthralling listening. If you love I Musici and I Solisti Veneti you probably won't like this. The rubato is pretty free and the dynamics full on, compared to the four square steady-as-she-goes performances of old by IM and ISV, but EG's playing has warmth and verve, with plenty of exciting moments to savour, while the recording quality is excellent. Sometimes Biondi's free playing and romantic touches are unacceptable but here he hasn't gone overboard, so I am always quite mesmerised when I play these discs, and that's a good sign. It's well worth the budget price."
4,An Unusual Approach to Vivaldi,"Let's go over the edge and see what's down there! This is an absolutely schizophrenic performance. Nothing period about it. This is Vivaldi rooted firmly in the 21st century. Violins and theorbos are used at times like percussion instruments. The baroque sewing machine rhythms sometimes come to abrupt stops as if someone tossed a rock into the machinery. This performance has an attitude. If you cut your teeth on performances by Hogwood or I Musici you may have trouble getting used to this performance. But if you have a musically open mind, or if you enjoy listening to the old painted with a new pallet you may enjoy it. The musicians are able, and at times virtuosic. It's not for everybody, but then again, what is?"
2,Hogwood rules,"First time I listened to this recording I got really excited. I have known the work for years through several recordings. Biondi made it sound fresh, exciting, new. But after 20 minutes I got tired of it. It just becomes too much. Trying too hard to be original and end up just sounding mannered and forced. I still listen to it every now and then for short periods of time. Sound quality is great and technically they all play really well.However, Hogwood still rules. Even after 10 years the performance sounds fresh and spontaneous and at the same time technically perfect.If you have one Lestro, make it Hogwood's."
3,Swedish Potato Chips.,"I purchased them as I consider myself sort of a conisuer of potato chips and am constantly looking for new flavors. They are good but not great. Not too greasey but the chip size itself is rather small, more pieces than anything else. I have a brother in law who is gluten sensitive and they happen to be glutten free so he loves them."
3,$10.73 for just okay,"I needed at least $7 to finish out my order and it seemed tidier to have this than 30 bags of crunchy cheez doodles on hand.The manufacturer's address is in Sweden but I have no idea if that is where these chips were made. I don't really like them. The scent permeates from the sealed bag, they are supposed to be healthier but I don't find them delicious. They are just okay. They seem to have a soggy underlayer. The chips are in small pieces. The bags are flattened. I was expecting more. The expiration date is 3 months away but these are less tempting than cheese rounds, keebler cheddar and peanut butter sandwiches and taro chips. They are about as tempting as honey graham sticks which means they are not tempting at all.This item is worth at most a sampling from someone else's bag. My advice is to pass on it."
3,Enjoyable,"Preston Falls was a good read. Very well-written. Willis got a little tiresome after a while, but for the most part his antics were amusing. The ending was disappointing and very flat."
1,Seemed Pointless,"I must have missed something, because I thought this book was incredibly boring and completely pointless. I kept hoping that something would happen to these unhappy characters, but it never does. By the end, I wanted the author would kill Willis off to guarantee there wouldn't be sequel."
3,"Wonderful writing style, but unsympathetic main character","The book kept my attention because it is very well-written. The observations are great. There is enough humor to keep it from being depressing. However, I thought Willis was a totally irresponsible, self-absorbed person. I did enjoy the parts of the book about his wife and kids. In the end, I wondered what happened to them and did not care what happened to Willis."
2,Who is this guy?,"Preston Falls was an easy read that probably deserves at least one more star. However, the main character and his motives are so underdeveloped that I didn't only not know who he really was, but I didn't care. The author paints a picture of a unconvincing mid-life crisis, a marriage that I couldn't figure out from the start, and a caricature of a dysfunctional family. The writing is fine, the story is not."
4,Well-written character study of a deteriorating marriage,"I thought this book was extremely well-written and Gates does have an ear for language. The characters were a bit sketchy and don't read this if you're looking for lots of plot. It is a character study and a look at the effects that a disintegrating marriage has on everybody. It's a little depressing, but well worth the investment of time."
2,"Dark; a ""War of the Roses"" sans the plot, dialog & actors","A dark and tragic story does not necessarily make a bad novel. However, a dark and tragic story that doesn't go anywhere (and not even fast), has no plot and flimsy dialog is a tough sell. This 'War of the Roses' type novel centers (or tries to) around Doug Willis; a confused, middle-age man experiencing that unwelcome crisis. With one exception, most middle age crisis' go somewhere......unlike this book."
1,NOT ENOUGH MINUS STARS!!!,"First--I do not consider myself a prude.That said--the language in this book is horrendous.30 pages---that's it--I couldn't do any more--terrible.AAANNNDDD all of the people in those 30 pages wereso dis-interesting, I had no reason to continue.This was not literature!!! I will read my EMMETTLOVE books instead!! And a few PARKER's. And a coupleof PERETTI's."
3,In a bubble?,"Perhaps I'm living in a bubble, but I absolutely don't know anybody who shows such consisitently bad judgment and selfishness, and imposes misery upon himself and others, as Willis in this book. Is this supposed to be a ""realistic"" account of a disintegrating marriage? Indeed, what a dreary existence where every single thought out of this man's head is a profanity. I refuse to believe that people like this really exist."
2,This book is about a white guy.,"I ain't read the book, but I'm sure there's words in it. There was words in the last book I read--too many to count. And that's what books need more of: numbers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . and so on. I guess plot and character de-velopment are OK if you do 'em right, but most times they just don't make no sense. Numbers never lie. So start counting."
3,Toby Keith Shock'n Y'all,"A little disappointed in some of the songs, some I'd never hear of, I was expecting alot more songs that I knew. I guess I'll have to read more of what I'm buying."
5,Wonderful,"I think that Manson is a great work that truely is captivating from the very first page. You want to hate the main character and by all means he gives you no reason not to. But, at least in my opinion, you wind up feeling empathy for him and hope that he can survive himself a little better. The book has the intelligence and wit of Kurt Vonegut but is fresh and new and can only be the beginning of a very successful career for Christopher."
5,Angel Glow,"This product works. I have used it for tear stains on 2 dogs. After a few weeks, all stains are gone & do not come back. The eyes do not water, therefore stains are gone. Easy to combine with food & dog eats without a fuss."
5,good product,After a month of using this product my little dog is 95% tear stain free. It did just what it said it would. I would buy it again.
1,angel glow tear stain,"they sent me the product,very fast but it still has not worked on my maltese thanks again"
4,Angels' Glow,"I bought this for Harley, my six-month-old shih-poo. Mixing up a paste using yogurt is a better option than sprinkling it on Harley's food. He did not care for the powder on his food. I mix it up in a small plastic container. Then I put it on one finger and simply open his mouth with one hand and put the paste in his mouth. He licks what's left on my finger and were all done. Takes little time. I've been using it for about two weeks and it appears to be helping, but there is still staining."
1,Review on Andel's Glow,My dog Charlie is only 4 lbs. Gave him 1/8 tsp. mixed in cottage cheese. The next day he vomitted. Tried it one more time and the same thing happened. Product did not agree with my dog - consequently I cannot give it a good review - sorry. I did call Angel's Glow and explained what happened. Fellow on the phone was very nice - said that I probably should have sprinkled a little bit on my dog's food a few times before I gave the full dose. Told him that it would have been good if that was written somewhere but it was not. Only instructions on back of bottle told how much to give according to the weight of the dog. He said I should probably try it again starting with the sprinkle of Angel's Glow. Told him I think my dog has been sick enough and didn't want to try it again.
4,Redbone...,"""Come and get your Love"" was the signature song for this group of Native American Entertainers. It put them on top of the charts! Four stars!!"
5,The Quintessential Collection for Fans of The Tokens!,"This recording on Taragon Records (a division of BMG Records) is a compilation of all the greatest original hit recordings of The Tokens. From their early recordings of Tonight I Fell In Love and The Lion Sleeps Tonight (Wimoweh), to later hits such as I Hear Trumpets Blow, Portrait of My Love, and It's a Happening World, this CD will delight true Tokens fans as well as anyone who appreciates 60's harmony groups. If you have been waiting for a CD with all the greatest hits of The Tokens, don't miss this one!"
4,back to basics,"This cd is a departure from Robert's previous works going back to the basics. The stories are from the heart and gives you just a glimpse of the traditional upbringing on the Pueblo along with the the influence of musicians that took him through his formative years. This cd will make you laugh, make you cry and keeps bringing you back for more."
1,boring boring this is the real review .................,"First off what everyone else is saying is wrong this game is boring it has no cut scenes or animation.No voice at all and they say this is a old school game? BS! lunar the silver star is nothing like this lunar was fun and creative and unpredictable. This game has no speacial moves at all the only thing is you let your power meter reach %100 then just press the O button and thats it. The enemys are lame monsters not even detailed monsters and the field where you fight is the same thing and what makes it horrible is the music is the same all around the same places it will drive you nuts , not even skill levels increase this is a strait up boring game with boring story line i warn people this is boring"
4,Finally found this product!,I love this cocoa butter creme! I use it everyday and it's the only moisturizer I use on my face. People tell me that my skin look so smooth and it glows. Glad I was able to locate it at Amazon.com Thanks!
4,Insightful Reading,"Reading Mr. Gordon's account of childhood memories is interesting food for thought that perhaps there is more truth in all the ""fictional"" accounts about encounters/collaborations with extra terrestrial life forms that are ever-present in today's popular culture. Supported by remarkable pieces of evidence, this makes an interesting reading for anyone interested in UFOs, extra terrestrial encounters and conspiracy theories. I just have one minor point of criticism, though... the account breaks off in mid-climax. Come on, Mr. Gordon... give us more!..."
4,Hot/waterproof,"These shoes are a little hot, but they are truly waterproof. The sole has a very aggressive non slip configuration."
2,Supplement book,"I don't think you can pass this exam by reading this book only. Book contains mistakes and confusing questions and answers. Some topics are covered very well. Which is good for knowledge but nothing to do with the exam. If you need supplement book, I would recommend this book."
2,Not the book to start your studying with,"If you are just starting to study for your Oracle8 to Oracle8i upgrade certification, don't start with this book. There arejust too many technical mistakes. For example, the book alwaysseems to mix up DBMS_OLAP and DBMS_SUMMARY. These are technical mistakes, not just typos. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of typos also. This would not be so bad if errata were available. None was found at the designated web page specified in the book. It is nice to know that Oracle Press has not changed its way. Similar comments are being made about the book that is used to upgrade from Oracle8i to Oracle9i. My recommendation is to use the exams provided by the ""Self Test Software"" company. Not only are the test questions good but they will also respond to issuesthat you may have with the question or answer. Oh, I don't have any financial interest in the ""Self Test Software"" company."
2,SONY NP-FF50,I used the battery for only two months before the charging rate deteriorated so badly and it could hardly hold a 30 minutes charge. The original battery which came with my camera took almost 4 years before deteriorating to this level.
3,The Leper's Return,Michael Jecks series of stories about Knights Templar is very entertaining. This book follows his theme. It is not the best of them but is a good read.
3,More lepers? Please...,"This is, like all of Michael Jecks' Templar mysteries, well-plotted and characterised, but it is the weakest that I have read so far for predictabllity, at least for those of us who have suffered through Stephen Donaldson's writing."
5,Great Book For Tea Lovers,"Apparently I ordered an older version of this book. That's fine, the jokes about the USSR were still funny. Outside of that, not much was anachronistic. The whole book was entertaining, informative, and often times humorous. I would think that any tea lover would also love this book."
5,I didn't want this book to end! Where's the sequel?,"My God, a real book! I couldn't get over this writing! Thoughtful, smart, funny as heck and so wise and brave. It made me realize how every night I go to sleep grateful my parents are still alive even though I pay very little attention to their well being because they're so far away. Komaiko has reminded me my own aging is happening now, it's not so bad, and there is a solution to getting old besides a lot of denial and a face-lift. Read this book! You'll love it!"
2,Fire the recording engineer,Gielgud's narration is often drowned out by the music and his much-vaunted Shakespearian delivery is often unintelligible in its own right. The composer has a lot of nerve comparing one of these pieces to one of Rimsky-Korsakov's works. You might as well compare cubism to real art.
1,Biased Book,"This book is heavily biased in India's favor. The reader does not get the point of view of the opposing side ie the Kashmiri freedom fighters. The author uses emotions, rather than facts to support his claims."
4,doens't work with leopard mac osx,"seems like a great instrument, but doesn't have a driver for mac osx leopard so the usb hookup doesn't work, which is unfortunate, apparently edirol are working on it, but Leopard came out 6 months ago so i'm not holding my breath. it is still possible to use an midi to usb adaptor they told me but i haven't tried that yet."
1,A rather mundane and average voice with substandard lyrics.a,this track leaves a lot to be desired by the ex- model turned wannabe pop diva.caprice's voice just does not have what it takes to make the listener want to jump on the dance floor and get moving. if there is a silver lining however it is the average hook in the track.
5,Great Pop Hook with a Killer Track!,If you like dance music that could easily find it's way to top 40 radio this is the song for you. The best dance/pop song I have heard in a long time!
4,A good dance-pop sound!,"If you like dance music with a strong pop sound and strong vocals, this is your target!"
4,Good Nutshell,"This Nutshell covers the law of professional responsibility. Going beyond black letter law, the authors discuss trends, topics and issues in professional responsibility facing the lawyer today.I am a big fan of the Nutshell series. They are generally well written, and go nice job of bridging the case law with meaningful analysis to the black letter law.The three key books in the study of law - a casebook, a Nutshell, and a black letter review book (like Gilbert of Emanuel). This Nutshell will certainly help you understand the Law or Professional Responsibility better."
5,A good read,I always like to read about the lives of other people. Especially one as famous as Jean Young. Her daughter has written a lovely biography as well as life lessons that were taught to her by her mother. A wonderful gem of a book to be read by young and old alike.
3,Tune to the radio show instead.,"Enigmatic stories, some memorable, but most would be better in the oral tradition on Joe's trance-inducing radio show. The stories read like background studies, and much action is presented in summary. There's an emotional reserve, a sense that the outsides of the characters are exposed, but not the insides. Are they just going through the motions of life, or is there a feeling side that the author simply doesn't present? Since they are stories of rootlessness and alienation, it makes a certain amount of sense; still, the characters are presented like bugs in a jar, and though you don't really understand the experience of living as a bug, it is fascinating to observe human beings in the vast variety of individual lives."
5,A very compelling group of short stories,"I can little relate to stories of heroic millionaires living in castles, or titled members of European Society. Joe Frank gives us a group of short stories about real people with real problems, worries, and conditions. From stories of compulsive, loser nebbishes like ""Fat Man"" to the tragedy of the Human condition found in ""Night"", Frank gives us characters we many times find disgusting, yet fascinating. And Frank's excellent narrative storytelling style only makes it better. I would highly recommend this book."
4,"A delightfully detached, and detailled account of crossing.","Donald was a simple hetrosexual crossdresser for years, until without really realising it he started to cross the line, and become a woman. This book hits many chords, that I have known. It proves that a transsexual can survive a long time before really recognising their fate and fortune. It clearly demonstrates the dogged relentless way in which transsexuals will pursue their goal, against all odds, often not really conscious of the building decisions, and changes they will bring until the process is well underway.Donald suffered at the hands of his sister, and society's limited vision. Donald stuttered, Deidre continues to stutter. Crossing is not a panacea for all ills, but Deidre seems to have risen like a phoenix out of the ashes, as a better, happier person. Read this book and understand what being a transsexual is all about."
1,A disjointed and unconvincing read,"I plodded through this book. It is very disjointed. I sense that Ms. McCloskey is very narcissistic and pretentious. I feel unconvinced by his assertion that he was a woman trapped inside a man's body. It was very self-centered for him to undergo a gender ""crossing"", not giving any consideration for the feelings of his wife and children."
4,This book was a good view of a Native Americans in N.England,This book was a very vivid desription of a young Native American girl who was forced to leave all that she knew behind to find her mother's family. She may never see her past again. I enjoyed this book because I felt as though I knew Walking Breeze as a dear friend. Her problems were very realistic for the time period.
2,Get from the the library,"I would not recommend spending money on this book. If you wish to continue the series, get the book from the library. The main characters are not likable or believable."
3,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I did not like this book at all.The main character, Ebie, is spoiled ,insecure, and jealous. Even though she is believable,she is hardly likable. Ebie goes out of her way to be mean to her half-Shawnee cousin,Walking Breeze.This book is certainly worth reading,especially i f you've already read the first bookof this trilogy. However, it isn't worth buying. If this is your first time reading a book by Ann Rinaldi, I suggest you read ""A Break with Charity..."""
3,It's Time For Greatest Hits Vol. 2,"I enjoy the music of Dan fogelberg. But I am tired of record labels rereleasing the same stuff with one or two different tracks and giving it a new title. This CD isn't that much different from the 1982 Greatest Hits release. I would love to see a greatest hits volume 2 CD from Dan fogelberg. It would include songs like, She Don't Look Back, Seeing You Again, Language Of Love, Go Down Easy, Lonely In Love, and There's A Place In The World For A Gambler. I wish that record labels would stop filling greatest hits CD's with Extra throw away tracks that no one knows. A greatest hits CD should be just that. All of the hits, and the versions that we know and love."
2,the dark side,"I have read ""The wishing season"" by the same author and loved it.Sadly, this book, though is has a great premis, is not as good at all.The main Characters were either not likeable. Some were like people you would cross to the other side of the street to avoid, others were plain annoying. Often the language was offensive. What is interesting about characters that are constantly mean and rude to each other? The crude sexual references were supposed to be funny but seemed out of place in a book like this. It was entirely unnecessary for there to be the topic of pedophillia in a book aimed by it's very premis at young adults. As an adult, I was really turned off by the thought of what adults might want with anatomically correct android children who are self aware. This could have been a light hearted fantasy, but it turned out to be depressing"
2,For Shame - For Shame,"This work is a BIG disappointment for Friesner afficionados. Her wild and wacky sense of plot is nowhere in evidence in this hackneyed tale of a Virtual Reality AI gaining full sentience and escaping the confines of the game. Whoop-de-doo, the whole schtick has been done before, and better."
2,Child Anxiety book,"Older book, OK but not great. Just didn't find the format of the book very user-friendly. Book did arrive on time. So the Amazon seller was good. The product just wasn't great."
1,Also Contains Sulfiting Agents,"When reading the label in the store, I discovered that this contains sulfite, a preservative that can cause serious allergic reactions in some people. I only get migraines from it. It is listed as an ingredient on the McCormik website.Why isn't it listed on the Amazon site? Are there other products with an incomplete ingredient list? It would be wise to check the manufacturers website before you buy."
4,Kim Anderson's Photography,"After viewing this book, I was touched greatly at the preciousness of children. They are an amazing gift and expressed wonderfully in this book. I highly recommend it and think the photography is phenominal."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Ok, people are buying this DVD specifically for nude beefcake? All you get is one scene that accidentally shows nudity and the editor blurred it out! WTF? TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. The days of Dieux du Stade are over."
3,C'est la vie,"The French use too say.I owns 2005,06,07,skip08,09,10,11.These D.V.D's used to be candit like behind the scenes showing some genitals.But NOT anying more!."
2,Not for a novice,"Okay, so maybe I'm just not that schooled in cooking but I found this book extremely time consuming. From pulling out my dictionary to find out what some of the incredients were to calling my mom to have her walk me through the steps--I did not feel like Better Homes was holding my hand. And another thing, the dishes never tasted how I thought they would. They tasted fine, just not what I expected. One huge positive, the finished product pictures are beautiful."
1,Great Pictures,This cookbook has beautiful pictures to bad the food does not live up to them. I tried 2 recipes both were bland and tasteless. I was so disappointed that I throw the book in the trash. Don't waste your money and time.
1,It was absolutely perfect for the first week,"It worked when I put it in and a week later a friend who was following me told me it was not working. I checked the ""Jeep wiring harness"" and it checks out just fine. I already threw away the shipping box, so I guess I'll just eat the cost and order another one."
3,Not as blinding as I'd hoped,"Without a reflector, the standard 1157 bulb isn't that bright. I put in a ""super bright LED,"" but that wasn't much brighter. For the price, it's better than nothing. The wire length was perfect to route through my safety hook and into my 4-pin connector on my F150."
1,Poor quality and a lot of money,I thought I was paying for quality and style instead I was just paying for the name. The band broke right off
4,A good book on a major Tibetan tradition,"A Buddhist practitioner's view of the great goddess of Tibet. Bokar Rinpoche draws a clear distinction between the western scholar's view of the practice of Tara, and his own - the Tantric meditator's outlook - which he defends with his customary compassion and insight. A valuable book for anyone interested in Tibetan deity practices, it suffers from an occasionally rocky translation from French and naive but by no means illegible book production."
4,Green Tara,Tara the feminine devine by Bokar Rimpoche has greatly enhanced my devotional practice. He provides a clear translation of the 21 praises of Tara. He also explains many aspects of guru yoga and specifics of Tara practice in question and answer form.
5,storyteller,"If you like Harry Chapin, Willy Nelson, Or Kristofferson, you are going to love this CD."
4,"Todd Snider ""LIVE"" cd","Good music - love Todd! Check out his latest ""East Nashville Skyline"". Really good!!!!!!!!"
5,awesome,"This is the best album ever. Some of his songs are short, some are long, some are sad some are funny, and sometimes he goes for as many as 18 mins in between the songs, unless you yell at him then hell just shut up and play"
4,interesting live cd,this is a very interesting live cd. there is plenty of dialogue between songs that is both funny and entertaining.
5,Near Truths and hotel rooms live,This is classic Todd Snider. The stories alone are worth buying the CD. The songs are very good and tell some moving stories.
4,Greatest singer-songwriter-entertainer,"Todd Snider is one of the few (if any) musicians who can engage an audience for two hours with nothing but his guitar, harmonica, stories and songs.It is a treat to finally have a souvenir of those great live shows that he travels around the country giving under the radar of the mass appeal which he so richly deserves. I have seen Todd play in front of 20 people the same way he plays to 500.He could throw out the guitar and be entertaining just telling the stories. He is an original, and a great songwriter to boot.The great banter between songs also recalls Jimmy Buffett's earlier shows.Go see Todd Snider in concert at the small venues he plays before the rest of the world catches on. And buy the cd and listen to it closely - you will experience a full range of emotions, from the narrative of an AA meeting (Long Year) to the humor of Beer Run..."
5,Unusual hit man thriller. Zounds!,"Action packed, thoughtful, humorous, well written, engaging Detroit crime novel. Suspected mob hitman Peter Macklin is recruited to sneak on board a Great Lakes cruise ship and stop a hippie type terrorist group from committing mayhem. What's not to like?"
3,You get what you pay for..,"After only a few months, the nozzle broke, small plastic pieces broke off on trigger so it could no longer be used. The hose is better, although quite thin as hoses go, and now it is beginning to crimp right at the end where it attaches to the nozzle. If you buy this set, go out and get a metal (not plastic) nozzle and throw the cheap plastic one away. Also, you can buy a coil thing that goes on the end of the hose to keep it from bending/crimping. Plus side is that the rubber hose is opaque, you can't see through it, so you don't have the algae problem that some of those clear hoses create."
1,Nozzle & Hose Don't Last Long,"I've had this hose for under 6 months. The nozzle that came with it did not last very long at all, which wasn't a huge deal. I bought a better nozzle and replaced the one that came with it. Then recently the metal hose end detached from the rubber hose. Due to the location it's impossible to fix with tape and I now have to replace the hose. You should purchase a hose that doesn't connect directly to the metal end, one that has a plastic connection between the two would last longer and that's the type I will be buying next."
5,great hose for the price,"We recently ordered several new coiled hoses as we had new outside water lines installed. Since they are now running lines with blue plastic tubing, our old green hoses no longer looked good. These are a perfect match for the new lines. The package arrived quickly. We were also pleased that the hoses came with spray nozzles so we did not have to worry about finding ones that fit without leaking. We are quite pleased and our plants are thrilled."
4,"Street of Riches, a rich read!","I found this collection of stories culturally intriguing and found it quite relevant as well to todays world. The sotries intertwine and a complex plot leaves the reader satisfied. If you need action, this may not suit you, but for drama and intrigue, be sure to pick this book up. An excellent example of the excellent Canadian authors from Manitoba!"
2,can't dial out,phone looks and works fine however cannot dial out. tried both pulse and touch tone and neither works. May be a defective unit.
2,Ringer Way to loud!,"bought this the other day and trying to figure out how to send it back. The ringer is way too loud, no dual alarm and no caller id. the only things that are right are the white color and the price."
3,Worth the price,"As others have mentioned, the clock is difficult to see when in bed. This was solved by cutting a cork in 3/4 in. pieces and gluing 2 of them to the bottom back of the unit, elevating the back of the clock. The phone has a loud, shrill ring, but it is rarely used, so not a problem. It does not receive AM radio stations well. Manufacturers have basically abandoned making an attractive combination phone, clock and radio unit for the bedside. This is the best I could find."
2,Not pleased!,I should have heeded previous reviews because reading the time dial is impossible when you are turning your head on the pillow--you can't see the clock. My wife is very unhappy with this purchase. Don't buy it.
2,clock alarm,The clock lays very very low on this hard to see unless you sit up in the bed. Don't think you can use it to see the time unless you only want to see it when sitting by the phone. I wanted it for the bedside can't see the clock at all
1,Can't see the clock from bed and too loud!,"One naturally assumes that a telephone/clock/radio/alarm with snooze is essentially designed for being next to the bed. However, in bed, you can't see the clock. While the product is well made, has good radio reception and the phone works well the product is down-rated because the angle of the clock's numerals is such that they may only be seen when sitting upright or standing next to the clock. You can also not see the time from across the room. Additionally, the ringer is either on or off, nothing in between. The volume of the ringer is jarring. All things considered I cannot use this as a bedside clock and must return it."
2,Misleading,The information is misleading. The phone does not have a dual alarm. It has an alarm dual mode. The phone handset does not light up nor does the phone have called ID. Not happy and returning the phone.
4,Good bedside companion,"OK product, but digital image weak (low light).All features work well---radio, alarm,etc. Low cost."
2,Phone/clock radio--poor design,"I purchased this to replace an old phone/clock radio. The old one had a far superior design to this one. Specifically, the on/off/alarm switch is on the side and awkward to use, setting the alarm and clock is time consuming because you can only change it forward, not back and forth, shutting off the alarm is also problematic because it is a single button that must be held down for a second or so. My old one went off when you moved the phone off the cradle, a better design.All in all, I should have looked more carefully at the features prior to purchase but hard to do on line."
4,"Inexpensive, versatile & lovely","I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I bought it because it is very inexpensive & looked good. When they arrived, I was very pleased. The stand on each frame snaps on & off easily for use on a shelf or table or on a wall. You'll be glad you bought this, I certainly am. :)"
4,Wishes,"Good product. But I wish it were not susceptible to alcohol damage, and once the can is opened and the used lid is replaced, it is very hard to remove again."
3,too much!,"got thisfor my rabbit because she was chewing the metal of our old water bottle (to the chagrin of my lady). diameter of hole is pretty huge tho, and she tended to spill half the water on her head. notreally a problem, but she'd go through a full container once a day, which made me worried she wouldnt have any water while i was away at school."
4,Good characters and a good tale too,"Kathy Tyers as per usual likes to set her characters in ""interesting"" times. In this story the larger political setting gives our main character Llyn a boost in her quest to find independence from her guardian/therapist when she is both a minor, and a committed mental patient. Despite continuing problems from a prolonged stint in a virtual reality tank at a young age, Llyn is determined to be herself, while her guardian is determined to keep her safe, protected, and controlled. In the end Llyn's problems turn out to be a great and necessary talent. Not as riveting perhaps as some of Tyers' other books, but a cracking good read nonetheless. It will make you think about the difference between protecting and smothering."
4,Great place to start searching for early Chrsitian truths,"This book was the first book I read on the early Christian writings that were not in the bible. I found it very enlightening. Pagels discusses the early history of Christianity what influences played a part in the building of our modern bibles. The translation of the gospel of Thomas in the back of the book really changed me deeply, The gospel of Thomas translation alone is worth the price of the book.Highly recommended read for an understanding of 2nd century Christian origens/"
2,Not enough information about Thomas,"Disappointing....The book is only 1/5th about the Gospel of Thomas, 3/5ths about the history of the early church; and, 1/5 was about the life events which led her to look at Church history differently.If you want a short introduction of the history of the early church and its evolution then this may be a book for that.The cover was beautiful, the book was not."
3,Not About Thomas,"This is a disappointing book--largely because of its misleading subtitle. It is not about the Gospel of Thomas. Barely a handfull of pages are devoted to that wonderful and mysterious work. The bulk of Pagel's book (at least 3/4's) is about the Gospel of John and the politics of the early church that led to its inclusion in the New Testament over other gospels like Thomas. If you are a church history buff you will love this book. If, like many of us, you are looking for something beyond Christianity, this book is not very helpful. It only hints at the alternative. It does, however, shed light on the reasons that particular religion has failed some in their spiritual quest."
4,Another highly accessible and inspirational outing.,"Elaine Pagels has done it again, turning out another highly readable and eloquent exposition of religious truth. Although she focuses on the Gospel of Thomas rather less than her title would suggest, she nevertheless gets to the heart of the matter: the rich diversity of Christian origins and modes of belief. I found the description of her attempt to find meaning in religious faith during and after her son's death revealing and compelling. Elaine Pagels remains an inspiration to those of us who reject the dogma and bigotry of ""comic-book Christianity"" (my phrase), but still seek to rely on our religious tradition for guidance, solace, and strength. She is for me a leading member of a group of writers including John Dominic Crossan, Marcus Borg, and Kathleen Norris who make it possible for thinking people to reclaim their religious heritage. Like Borg and Norris in particular, her books are highly accessible and aimed at the general reader."
3,The Gospel of St John is more accurate,"If you want a review of the gospel of Thomas look to the references cited in this book. The end notes are an excellent source of research in early Christian texts. This book is about the gospel of St John, how the politics of the time shaped what was written and how the work of Origen and the Emperor Constantine decided what gospels would constitute the New Testament. The writing is uneven or perhaps it needed tighter editing to have the work flow in a more even pace.This mis-naming and awkward, read as uneven, pace seems to be characteristic of Pagels, her origin of Satan had similar problems. What she clearly possesses is the desire to ferret out the details and offer a plausible explanation."
1,Pagel's Pays the Mortgage.,"This work By Dr Pagels contains no new information and should be called Pagel's repeats. I have read Adam,Eve and the Serpant, the Origin of Sin and the Gnostic Gospels and enjoyed them all but this latest book is just a tiresome rehashing of what she has written before. There is very little in the book about the gospel of Thomas and no new insights into gnosticism that she has not written before.This book reminds me of a greatest hits albumn released because the band needs to pay the mortgage. Nothing new or interesting."
2,"personal, not systematic exegesis","Pagels' book is an almost-too-good representation of syncretist gnostic thought. The fact is, though, to understand the Idea or Essence in any system of thought, we must go to the doctors or epitomes of that creed. The proper study of this dualism, and its relation (anti-relation) to Christianity is to be found in, e.g., Manichaeism, Buddhism, Catharism. Dried-up popular and superficial creeds don't have the life in them that these more excellent (and demanding faiths) do. The proof is plain; each of these aforementioned movements has its Saints. Where, I might (unfairly) ask, are the martyrs, the living perfections of the New Age movement? One actually has to stifle his laughter; it (Gnosticism) will fade again, and return again; no matter. Pagels is no saint."
2,What's the big deal?,"So, Thomas said what you are seeking, Christ, is in you, all of you. John said to look not into yourself. So what? Lots of Christian thought says that you need to look for Christ within you. Read Meister Eckhart. Is that now OK when it was previously Gnostic? John may not be Gnostic, but it is filled with gnosticisms, dualities, light, veils, etc. Sufism is filled with gnosticisms; Kaballah is filled with gnosticisms, esp. that of 16th C Sefat and Isaac Luria. Being gnostic in thought does not make one a Gnostic. The Gospel of John is just as gnostic as is the Gospel of Thomas."
3,Good yet not what I was expecting,I was looking for and in-depth look at the Thomas gospel. Instead received a basic yet knowledgeable explanation why it did not make it into the New Testament.
4,AN ENTRE INTO THE WORLD OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY,"If you have read Gary Wills' Why I Am A Catholic, you will see how from the early middle ages on, the communities of believers who already possessed the creed became the modern Catholic Church. This book on the other hand brings us to the first 2 centuries of christianity, and shows us the debate between those who were building a creed by editing, and those charismatic christians who were full of the spirit.She also gives some room for those who while no longer believers, long for Christ's message"
3,no revelation here...,"While Elaine Pagels book is interesting from the standpoint of some of the political possibilities for the formation of the new testament, I personally found less conflict amongst the gospels than I found consistancies. I love that Thomas teaches that the imprint of God is within us all, and that God's light shines within all. But, at the same time all the Gospels speak to me about following truly a great prophet, priest, king, and son of God that Jesus is. Although most organized religions follow certain doctrine, there is much room for the Holy Spirit to mold each individuals understanding. Far more than might have been possible during the period of time in question, and perhaps more than Elaine gives the church credit for today."
3,Perhaps a great find?,"Found this today at the annual library sale for 25 cents and now that I have read the reviews on Amazon I am anxious to read it.Update: of all the books I got that day at the library sale this was the first I started and it has been interesting so far. Not nearly as ""heavy"" as my James Dunn."
1,Bad scholarship,"Though this book was popular in certain circles in the early church, the author ignores the fact the Church Fathers (mentored by the original disciples)were unanimous in rejecting it. While it does have some authentic quotations from Jesus (found in the other authentic gospels), it is also mixed in with massive doses of bizarre teachings. An example: ""When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female; and when you fashion eyes in place of an eye, and a hand in the place of a hand and a foot in place of a foot and a likeness in place of a likeness; then you will enter [the kingdom]."" Yeah, Elaine, you strapped yourself to a real winner. You found a gospel that reflects your bias."
2,Pagels Drops the Ball,"Elaine Pagels is known within the Gnostic Christian community as an author whose scholarship is impecable. Her first book ""The Gnostic Gospels"" is used to introduce interested persons to the Nag Hammadi library of texts, and for one reason, because it does the job with an emphasis upon an analysis of the texts. Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas would appear to be an exegesis of the Gospel of Thomas(hereafter called ""Thomas""), however it appears to be more of an autobiography combined with personal insights.Thomas is rarely mentioned in any substantial fashion throughout the course of her writing. There are more thorough exegesis of this phenomonal gospel available in print. If you're looking for an auto-biography and personal experience, buy this book. If not, I would highly advise keeping away from it."
4,Pagels always a good read,"Elaine Pagels is an author who is both erudite and mystical, so she allows spirituality to mix with academia--in a good way. A helpful book for those who are curious about the non-canonical writings of the early Christian church."
3,short review,"To keep this short...this book shouldn't be named ""beyond belief, the gospel of Thomas"". In that it only briefly covers that gospel in certain spots throughout the book. But that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. In fact, I really liked it. It skims over the fathers of the early church and how the ""gnostic"" gospels came to be excluded from today's ""Bible"". Its a beginning for anyone interested in such study and made reading ""The Nag Hammadi Library"" a little easier to understand."
3,Tell no lie Dr. Pagels.,Be careful here !!! The cover of this book is totally misleading as to what is inside. There is no explication on the Gospel of Thomas and only a slight mention of two tenets that are contained within.Go to the text at the back of the book if you want to see how the Gospel of Thomas is treated.I wish I had.
2,"""Where is the Gospel of Thomas?""","I want to begin by observing that this book has been grossly mis-titled. I purchased this book in the hopes of finding the text of the Gospel of Thomas with scholarly commentary. I found neither. Instead, I found a meandering writing which began with the authors own personal experience of rediscovering church followed by random pieces of gnostic text, church history, commentary and personal reflection. I found this book to be neither scholarly nor spiritual. I would not recommend this to anyone seeking either. This book was a disappointment, and if it were possible to get a refund for ""false advertising"", I would pursue it."
3,Not as good as her The Gnostic Gospels,"Pagels is a widely recognized authority on the diverse non-canonical literature of early Christianity. Though this appreciation of the Gospel of Thomas is interesting, it is murky in places and marred by her moving account of her personal tragedies which unfortunately she fails to relate clearly to the subject at hand. I found her older book (much older, actually - 1979, I think) far more clearly written and much more logically organized. The present work does incorporate some more recent scholarly work, and this edition includes the complete text of the Gospel of Thomas in English translation, which is quite helpful. I recommend Pagels's The Gnostic Gospels over this one."
5,top of the pile,Reading for the third time and still underlining and making notes. Learn more of Gnosis and early Christian history each time. Easy read. Well written.
5,awesome,"I loved this book. It reads fast, it's to the point, absolutely exciting! I liked ""Gnostic Gospels"" when I read it last year, but found it a struggle to get through. ""Beyond Belief"" just has a flair to it. Couldn't put the book down. Also, and most importantly, Ms. Pagels is fair as she presents ""accepted Christianity"" alongside ""hidden Christianity."" The entire Gospel of Thomas isn't included in this book. A quick internet search will get you the 100 odd lines of that. ""Beyond Belief,"" rather, puts the G.O.P. (oops, I'm not taking about the Republicans) in its proper mosaic perspective among early and EVOLVING Christian thought. Great job, Ms. Pagels!!! I recommend this book to anyone interested in Christianity, on any level."
2,misleading title,"I enjoyed this book and found it to be informative, as all of Ms. Pagels' books are, but I am completely mystified by the subtitle ""... the Secret Gospel of Thomas."" In fact, the book contains almost nothing about that particular Gospel. Most of the analysis was about the cannonical Gospel of John, how and why it was written, how it played against the early Gnostic sects of Christianity (though she has chosen not to use that term in this book). The book should have been titled more forthrightly; I was very disappointed that it was, in fact, NOT about the Gospel of Thomas, other than a very few brief mentions. The book was really more an exposition of how the early orthodox church became established, why it did what it did to supplant the 'heretics.' Which was interesting, but not ""the Secret Gospel of Thomas."" Why the deception?"
4,Well written,"I found this book well written and compelling , but not over the top. A good work to introduce and explain the relevance and works discovered known as the Gospel of Thomas."
2,"Personal, not Systematic Exegesis","Pagels' book is an almost-too-good representation of syncretist gnostic thought. The fact is, though, to understand the Idea or Essence in any system of thought, we must go to the doctors or epitomes of that creed. The proper study of this dualism, and its relation (anti-relation) to Christianity is to be found in, e.g., Manichaeism, Buddhism, Catharism. Dried-up popular and superficial creeds don't have the life in them that these more excellent (and demanding faiths) do. The proof is plain; each of these aforementioned movements has its Saints. Where, I might (unfairly) ask, are the martyrs, the living perfections of the New Age movement? One actually has to stifle his laughter; it (Gnosticism) will fade again, and return again; no matter. Pagels is no saint."
1,Anti-Christian,If you are looking to buy this book for an in depth view of The Gospel of Thomas keep searching. This book is no more than someones personal views toward Christianity. I read the complete book and learned nothing but a woman who is angry with God for personal tragedies in her life. She filled the book with referrances to scholars that back her bitterness to Christianity. I can only say that I hope the Lord brings peace and true understanding to her but I will not waste my time and money on anymore books by Elaine pagels.
2,One of the worst books I've ever read,"To be blunt, this was far and away the worst book I've yet read (and I've read quite a few) on early Christianity. Pagels does everything in her power to portray St. Irenaeus of Lyons, St. Athanasius of Alexandria, and the other great Church Fathers in as bad a light as possible, even lying, twisting the truth, and covering up facts. At the same time she slanders the Fathers of the Church, she equally attempts to redeem the Gnostics, portraying them as ""spiritual seekers"" and innocent victims of the institutional Church. Along the way in the book, Pagels tells us a bit of her own story, her own rejection of the institutional Church for what she views as a more ""spiritual"" form of Christianity. The rest of the book seems little more than a pale attempt to justify her own choice. I recommend keeping as far away from this book as possible if one wants to study early Christian history."
5,Quality Product,I've been collecting this series from the start and lost this one. Was very happy to find it and for so cheap.
1,not happy,ordered the dvd got the cd instead is the reason for a poor rating.But the cd is great Byron Cage is a awesome songwriter and director
5,iconic business story -- useful to all,"this is one of the best business books i have read. it is super-relevant for anyone in high tech but is also recommended for any business person.schein combines narration with theory & analysis in telling the story of DEC's meteoric rise and eventual sale to Compaq. the book is a rare mix of story-telling and more ""academic"" theory about management, strategy and culture. what makes the book so exceptional, beyond schein's insights and storytelling, is the unprecedented access he had to DEC executives."
5,Fascinating. Touching the emotional pulse.,"THis is a great book to escape into. Losers and unsettled types lead the reader to self evaluation. Through their struggles with the tribulations and the moral implications of the decisions they make, we face our own issues."
3,Great unkown band,"I first heard of Kissing Tigers on a free download site with only small, unkown bands. I listened to ""I Died in a Mall"" and was hooked. I can barely go a day without hearing it now. ""Stay in Love"" is a great song, also. It builds up and gets me dancing and then brings it back down again with low synth-sounds and hushed vocals. The lyrics are angsty and sexy at the same time and highly catchy beats make it easy to sing them all day. The only drawback is the flood in the market of synth-rock/pop bands, so the beats seem a bit cliche. The quiet, whispery vocals and song content make up for it though. Overall, this is definetly a good album."
5,Exellent book to explain about the loss of a loved one.,This book was a great help to explain to my children the unexpected death of their grandfather. The book focuses on the Christian concepts of death and what to expect. My husband and I read the book first and then explained the loss to our 5 year old twin sons. It was amazing how well they handled it. I am donating a copy of this book to my children's kindergarten class in order to help other parents who may need to discuss this difficult topic with their children.
1,Not for situation involving cremation,"This probably a great book but in my daughter's case, Grandma was cremated so to see her lying in a casket in the book would be very confusing."
2,Overpriced,The content is not sufficient for the price.I have a copy of the third edition and either I retained significantly more of what I read twenty five years ago or the book is vastly over-priced. It would be fine for someone with no knowledge of electronics IF it cost about thirty dollars.
5,Still a great book,I first encountred the first edition of this book in 1971 when attending College in Southern California. I started using the 4th edition in 1981 when I began instructing a college class on radio Communications. I have used Shrader ever since. The reason I use Shrader's book is because the book is accurate. Other books I have attempted to use have had errors in formulas and some information was not quite clear for the students. Shrader covers many subjects with a good basic explaination of circuits and systems. Shrader not only has a good understanding of the subject material he is able to relate the information without confusion.
4,electronic communication textbook,I like this book because I owned a copy many years ago and arrived at a point in my life where I missed it.
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read!,This book was such a blessing to me! It broke down who God is and what He desires for all His children (love and goodness). Gloria writes in a way that it is easy to understand...I couldn't put this book down. I'm almost done reading it (last chapter) and I'm planning on re-reading it when I'm done to incorporate it into my Bible study time. And I've already ordered 2 more books from her! Wonderful and life-changing!
5,God Is Good,"Many churches focus on how to be saved, but teach little about prosperity, healing, living a victorious Christian life, and how to live joyfully. Many people base their ideas about their heavenly Father by their earthly father which provides only a distorted view of God. If their earthly father was harsh, they see Jesus as unloving and unforgiving. If their earthly father was kind and gentle, they see Jesus like their earthly father kind, but full of mistakes. Jesus is like neither of these. Gloria Copeland takes us through the Bible quoting many verses simply, so a child can easily understand who we are in Christ and who Jesus really is and what he stands for. I encourage everyone to read this book. It contains the truth about God's love and the good things he wants to give all of us if we will just receive them As a certified Biblical Counselor, I am using this book with the Bible to help others see who Jesus really is."
4,Excellent for beginners,"I had no previous experience of playing bass guitar when I read this book. After 2 weeks of practicing on an acoustic, using 4 strings :), I bought my bass. The day I got the bass, I went to band practice at church, and got past the audition! Hows that for a learning curve, now I'm in the band! Thankyou to the author, simple to follow, easy to learn. Julie"
2,better books than this,"While this might get you started if you've never used director before, it won't get you much further than learning where the buttons are. I was surprised that a manual so think in pages could have so little information. Beware: this company has released and Director 8 version of this sam book but it still contains the same information. If you really want to know anything valuable about Lingo or interactive elements I recommend Using Director 8 by Que publishing."
3,Not the best book out there (especially for Lingo & OOP),"I have both this book and the Director 7 and Lingo Bible. Thelatter is definitely a much better book. It is not as large in size asDemystified is but it has more real-world examples and the author's style of writing is clearer and easier to follow.I bought Demystified first and was frustrated with the ""academic"" nature of it's examples. It's as if it was written by a tenured professor. The Director 7 and Lingo Bible, on the other hand, feels and reads like it was written by an industry insider with many multimedia projects under his belt.I'm not going to go in to too much detail on this in here as I just got through writing a review for the Bible and you can read that if you're interested in finding out why I prefer that book to Demystified."
3,Any book on this topic is helpful ...,"when you've been through the misery inflicted by somebody with NPD (narcissistic personality disorder). I do object to the religious overtones in a book that purports to be factual and investigative, and the concept of original sin seems to me forced into the mix here and a little contrived. But I will say that the description of the traits of the NPD individual is dead on, and if you're in a state of bewildered agony about what's happening to you in a relationship with such a person, it's a breath of fresh air to know that there are others in the same predicament, ""it"" has a name, you're not necessary wrong about everything--despite what you've been told, and it's extremely comforting to know you're not alone. If you've been through the very warped looking-glass reality with someone who has NPD, this book will help you, even if you don't necessarily agree with its religious world-view."
2,Get the hell away from any narcissist,"Aside from the author's personal Xtian views, this is a good book on relationships. Most people want to love and be loved.Narcissist do not. Every thing they are, everything they have and every thing they can get will be EXTRACTED from their source(s).This book fails to acknowledge the totality of self destruction inflicted on victims by a narcissist.If you don't care enough about your self (and children) to GET THE HELL AWAY, you absolutely need more help than any book can offer...get professional help."
4,"Dr. Louis Giordano, LPC, NCC, BCPCC finds this book helpful","I am a Licensed Professional , Nationally Certified Counselor in private practice in Chapel Hill, NC [...]. I found Dr. Carter's book on recognizing and managing people with Narcissistic personality very informative and practically useful. Dr. Carter goes beyond merely describing this difficult to recognize personality to identifying useful ways of living with people with this disorder without succumbing to it."
5,"Enough about you, Let's talk about me","I was very pleased with the fast service, the product and the price. I would definately buy from this seller again. The product arrived in good shape, nicely packaged."
1,Strong religious bias,"The author has a readable style, and the content might be helpful for fundamental Christians. However, the material has a strong Judeo-Christian bias making it unsuitable for 70% of the general population (and at least 85% of therapists). I quit reading it and threw it away after the author suggested the basis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder was original sin."
2,I wish i'd known before i bought the book,"I got to the second chapter of this book and found a long discussion about how Original Sin had an inescapable effect on human nature (causing all selfishness), that some people have a sin nature that causes them to do wrong and try to elevate themselves over God. Hello?! I thought I was buying a book based on psychology and how to change, not a book about how some of us are fated to be bad (game over!). This book is mislabeled. ""Self-help/relationships"" is the category printed on the back cover--those books are supposed to be able to teach us how to change, not preach the author's religious beliefs. With sentences like ""Somewhere along the way, you allowed a narcissistic human to become your final authority, not God,"" this book belongs in the Christian lifestyle section, not self-help. Be informed before you buy."
2,I Survived the King of Overrated Books,"I know I'm pretty much alone down here in two star land, but I was really disappointed by this novel. The style was irritatingly coy, cute and cliched. The narrator is insufferable. He brags about making whores fall in love with him and making absurd amounts of money selling hot dogs. Money always seems to equal happiness in this book, and there's much wasting of money too, gaily throwing it in the street and so on, to show off. Many cliches about rich people and their lovers. Is it all a spoof, a satire? Still tiresome, whatever it is. Creepy scene where he's ""blessed"" by Haile Selassie. Precious vignettes. Bursting at the seams with cliched phrases: ""tears of joy"", ""a heavenly expression on his face"", etc, etc (you can't blame them all on the translator). The hero is too perfect: even his flaws are ""charming"". A two dimensional, banal narrative masquerading as a picaresque ""masterpiece""."
4,A wonderful book,"When saying anything about this book, I am hampered by the necessity of having to read it in translation. But since translation hardly ever does anything to improve a text, I can only assume that this book is even more splendid in the original Czech.This is a rare example of literature that espouses Marxist ideas and values artfully and artistically -- with craft, in every sense of the word. If this book is flawed and unsatisfying in its denouement, perhaps it no more than reflects the basic flaw of Marxism, which has always been better as political satire than political and economic prescription."
4,Deserves Great Recognition,"I Served the King of England is a delightful book that follows a man from the lower classes to wild success to enlightenment. Don't mistake the 'enlightenment' for a Siddharthaesque plot. This book is not written in the detached style that Siddhartha is. Hrabal's writing is warm, sensitive, and alluring - as is the book's main character. From the Paradise brothel to an old hut in the woods, the main character's search for contentment is sincere. And that may be what makes the book so believeable."
3,Which episodes,"I love this show, but why aren't there editoral reviews, or product information? All I know is the price and that there are six discs. I've been waiting months for this information before buying this.What episodes are on this? All I could find out by searching the internet is that there are 44 episodes total. I don't know how many episodes are on each disc- some episodes were a half an hour, some were an hour."
4,Story grabbed me in the first 5 pages and didn't let go! 1,"I read this book almost without putting it down! The love between the H/H was so deep and complex, and done so well. I felt so completely taken by Rachel and Houston and their efforts to overcome what could have been a total disaster. Her leaving and her accident--his complete devastation at her going and then stepping in to help her thru. What a guy! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a gripping love story!"
3,Excellent film--horrible dvd,"This is an excellent film, well woth seeing. The dvd is probably the worst technically I have ever seen. Colors shift, focus drifts, I cannot understand how anyone could make such a miserable copy and then have the nerve to sell it without labeling it ""SUBSTANDARD""."
3,"Film is 5 stars, DVD is bah! ""Gold"" is a great flick",This mid-70's film is genuinely enjoyable and dramatic. The music is great (with a high-energy title song and 70's disaster flick chick Maureen McGovern doing a great love theme in the middle of the film). Roger Moore gives perhaps one of his two or three great non-Bond performances. But don't buy it until it's done right in widescreen with a solid remastering job. It's a real shame that wasn't done first time out. This is a genuinely good film with a small cult following.
2,Where's The Beef?!,I agree with most of my fellow reviewers on this project! Was lucky enough to have seen it on the big screen at the time of its release in 1974 so was truly enthralled throughout the film at that time.If Amazon has any pull with the producers of this less than clean production for DVD I would encourage them to contact their supplier and suggest they attempt to find a better copy of the original print and re-release the DVD for I would even be willing to pay a premium price for a re-mastered copy of this film...
1,Don't buy this dvd...,"It looks like a pirated copy someone taped off a television airing. The ""bad"" words are bleeped out and the sound and picture quality hint that it was copied from an old vhs tape. The packaging is cheap, as well. Why Amazon allows this inferior garbage to be sold on their site in the guise of a legitimate product, is beyond me. They should try to protect their customers from this kind of swindle."
3,Please producers!!!!,The movie is good but the reproduction of the DVD that I received was of a very poor quality! Obviously nobody wanted to spend money on making a good copy... what a pity!!!!No wonder it only cost about two dollars to buy!!!!
4,Interview with a Guardian,"This book will also be of special interest for Rosicrucian initiates, especially the passeges about the Guardian of the Threshhold."
2,look closely next time,"I should have looked at the size of the book prior to purchase. Because of an assumption, I now own a book where the pictures & layouts, the primary attraction of the piece, are half the size they should be. Also, the breakdowns of the furniture are missing. Poor purchase."
1,Absurd,"I ordered this book as a means of sharpening flagging Spanish language skills. I sent it back immediately, it was that bad. First of all the book is tiny (which is an insult considering the price); secondly the biographies of the authors (written in English) are longer than many of the stories themselves, which isn't saying much. Thirdly, though there are a variety of pre and post reading grammatical exercises there is NO ANSWER KEY, which renders all of the exercises meaningless."
1,27 1/3 cents per page.,"The stories are mediocre at best, there is no answer key for the grammar exercises and the price is astronomical. The paperback book weighs in at 150 pages and is priced at $41.00! Absolutely ridiculous."
4,Fela rises up on the west coast,"This Boxed CD set contains many of the Great Fela songs, but more songs should have been included. Fela Kuti is rising up in California he is invoked by his Godson Najite Agindotan whose band is called Najite and The Olokun Prophecy, listen to this boxed CD set, then run to listen to Najite's band if you want to feel the spirit of Fela. His Godson's email is najite4afrobeat@aol.com. This boxed set is a must have"
3,"It's a duck. Bigger than expected, but a good gift for what it is.","I originally bought this for a happy 0-day birthday gift, but it turns out the box states it is for ages 4 and over. So, I brought it for use in a White Elephant gift exchange, and it was taken up within the first few rounds. Good quality, looks nice, 5-6 in long."
3,"too wordy, exciting characters","I think that this book was decent, except that the authors tended to drag out the plot too much. If it was really historical, then they should have focused on more historical scenes. The love plot and the historical plot seemed to interrupt each other. I enjoyed the detailed characters, though. I also liked the suspenseful action in the Bahamas with Cobb, Roger, and Vivian. The last one hundred pages of the book were the best."
2,Not Recommended,"Anti-climactic is the best single phrase to describe this book. I guess it depends on what you want in a novel. It starts out with the air of mystery surrounding the ""Crown of Columbus"" and what it actually is; sort of a historical mystery, although fictional. The book then becomes a story about the two main characters and their on-again/off-again romance of opposites. Most of the book is about this romance and the action and resolution of the mystery don't really get going until the very end. By the time you find out what the ""Crown"" is, it is sort of ""so what?"" In other words, not very satisfying. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Crown of Columbus,"""The Crown of Columbus"" is an adventure story, a love story, a story of scholarship, and a story of a family coming together and making room for each other.The alternating chapters that give voice to the characters' perceptions remind us that there are at least two sides to every story, whether it is the story of a relationship, or the tale of the 'discovery' of America.The scholarly rivalry between the main characters, and their sense of the excitement historic research brings, rings true to those of us in academia.I would have moved Roger's epic poem about Columbus to the end of the book. I can see why it was placed where it is, but I expect most readers glance at it and skip past. This poem is not bad and really could be used as a teaching tool.""Crown of Columbus"" is a good novel to read on a long snowy day. It is a light-weight but I thoroughly enjoyed it.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"
4,"quite an interesting and entertaining story, actually","I remember enjoying this novel quite well, and even mentioning this to Louise Erdrich when she visited on a promotional tour for another book in England, back when it was recent.I think it is pretty true to life for a novel set around a university, and the images of Columbus remain, giving a very interesting point of view into how he may have actually looked at things. The times and his life were nothing if not complicated.1492 is the same year that Isabella and Ferdinand completed the long Reconquista of Spain in Granada, which is itself quite a tale, clearly full of its own intrigues and the march up to the Alhambra. How she found time to understand, approve, and bankroll Columbus would be very interesting to know.Anyway, again an entertaining novel of some particular kinds of life, which is after all what novels do. It's not Nanapush and Fleur, but it's not entirely far away in its approach if you think about it."
1,Incredibly awful!,"I never bothered learning the names of the characters because everyone was a stereotype. . . we have ""Honorable Native American woman trying to make it in the white man's world""; fifth generation male WASP with obsessive compulsive tendancies; ever wise and quirky Grandmother; rebellious teen age male, miracluous infant daughter; and greedy immoral industrialist.I did enjoy the description of the early research in the Dartmouth library . . . .but none of what was hinted at materialized and the ""Indiana Jones"" ending made me throw my copy of the book against the wall."
3,dragging and hard to get into,"This book was one of the worst I have read. I was expecting more of a historical novel, then what it really was. There should have been more historical scenes than there were. I was under the impression that this book contained similar events to Micheal Dorris and Louise Erdrich's immigrant background. I feel that the authors tried to make the plot more interesting by turning it into a love story, but really all they did was make it drag on. The book was slow and there was not enough excitment to keep me interested, until the ending. The last 100 pages of the book were the best and very surprising. If the entire book was like the ending, then it would probably be worth the time to read it."
2,Ugh....tedious,"After just finishing Dorris' book Yellow Raft on Blue Water, which was the first of his books I have read, I couldn't wait to get my hands on ANYthing else he had written. Unfortunately, the Crown of Columbus was the only one of his books my library had, so I grabbed it. I have to admit I only got in to it one chapter, but I knew immediately it just wasn't working for me. It didn't grab me like Yellow Raft did right from the very first paragraph! Sorry! I do plan to try his other books though....fingers crossed there will be another gem in them like Yellow Raft - one of the best books I have ever read."
1,Please make it stop,"Okay so to start off. This book has a really annoying way of tell the story. It starts off with this woman being stuck in a library (which doesn't really add anything to the book)and then delves into the story of this man she used to love and guess what they love each other again (big surprise). Basically the book is really boring for the first 200 pages then it gets marginally better towards the end but ruins the ending because the thing that the characters spend all this time looking for is insignificant and also they throw in this stupid ""poem"" by one of the characters which is about 20 pages long. You could have just skipped those pages and the story would have been exactly the same. Very disappointed."
5,A valuable introduction to the Theatre of the Oppressed,"This text represents a valuable introduction to the theories and practice of Augusto Boal. GFA, unlike its predecessor the Theatre of the Oppressed, contains practical exercises as well as an introduction to the important theoretical work of Boal. Boal's major innovations (such as Forum Theatre and Image Theatre) are introduced, discussed, and illustrated with examples, thus effectively allowing the reader to enter into the dialogue of using and refining the techniques. I would recommend this to any performer, artist, educator, or theatre worker who is unfamiliar with the work of Boal, and seeks new methods of understanding and transforming practice, and empowering both audience and participants."
4,Essential Resourse,"This text is an essential publication for any drama practitioner, teacher, actor. It encloses many unique activities that vary in levels of ability that enable the participants to explore various facets within drama/ theatre.A DEFINATE MUST HAVE!!!"
4,"Alternate versions are still fine, but not ""Essential""","Yet another Columbia compilation, albeit with sterling remastered sound. The twist here is that nearly all of these tracks are alternate versions instead of the familiar versions, all of which were substantial hits. There isn't a hair's breadth of difference, though, between the officially-released versions and these alternates, and in most cases the better version, however subtly so, was indeed the one chosen for contemporary release. This makes for a less-than-essential collection, despite the title and however great the performances and the material. For Sinatraphiles : 4 stars. For everyone else : 5 stars."
1,I've seen better...,"After reading The DaVinci Code, I wanted to watch a biography about DaVinci, so I purchased this movie. It was made sometime in the 1970's and the screen quality (even on DVD) is horrible. What's worse is the awful overdub. At the beginning of the movie an announcer explains that there is not a lot of information on the childhood of Leonardo DaVinci, but this is what could have happened...and they create little childhood for DaVinci. I thought this would have had biographers and mini dramatizations on DaVinci's life...not a full movie recreating his life."
1,The Life of Leonardo Da Vinci,"I was disappointed in this DVD, I expected more of a factual DVD, but this was more drama and I'm not sure how accurate."
3,Mr. Italo Hollywood,"Although the reviewers seem to like this film a lot, the Italians did not do any justice with this overlong version of the famous artist. It presents him as a callous and distant man, somewhat obsessed by a hatred toward his natural father. In contrast, there is enough documentation that proves him as a very gregarious individual who did a lot for his friends! Then the film lacks his accomplishments as an inventor, and the one obscure but very fun part of his life: In Milan, he was in charge of food services; Leonardo invented the modern eating utensils we use today. Therefore, he had little time to paint. A silly outdated version, where is a good studio when you need one."
2,Still Damaged Goods,"If you check the Amazon reviews for the previous version of this DVD, you will see a number of disgruntled reviewers remarking how Questar released a grossly edited version of this excellent series, cutting out great chunks of on-screeen narration that were part of the great appeal and informative character of the original. With the chance to correct that failure with this new DVD release and restore the lost value, Questar has once again cheated viewers and disrespected the artists who created this series, adding supplementary shorts, but leaving the main documentary in its still badly mangled form.By all means, get the VHS version and view it first, which I thankfully already own, if you want to see what these filmmakers really did, rather than settling for the this hatchet job Questar has shamelessly, repeatedly marketed to DVD shoppers. A disgrace."
4,Worth Buying,"Charlie Daniels is a very good musician who surrounded himself with quality musicians. Had some songs that you just had to sing along with. Lyrics that everyone could relate to.Having said that if I ever hear ""The devil Went to Georgia "" one more time I will vomit. The wooley swamp is campy too.But put those songs aside this CD provides a lot of 'lay back and relax and enjoy the music"" type feel.And speaking of the ""The Devil went to Georgia"", I thought the Devil's solo was better!"
4,Very Good Compilation,"Although I purchased this CD for one song, Uneasy Rider, I found that there were several on here that I had forgotten about. Charlie Daniels really lets loose on his songs and gets into them. The energy of band comes flowing through with each and every song on the compilation. The CDB puts a bit of comedy in their songs such as The Devil Went Down To Georgia and Uneasy Rider. If you're in the partying mood having a barbque and a cooler full of Coors (which I don't like BTW) then party hardy and put this CD on and get down, get with it."
5,"SOLARAY - TART CHERRY, GREAT FOR ""GOUT"" SUFFERERS","I've been using The Tart Cherry 425mg capsules for several years now, I take two in the Morning and two in the Evening. That seems to workperfect for me. I was having ""Gout"" attacks quite regularly, every two or three month's, since I've been taking the Tart Cherry, Now I seldomhave an attack and when I do, they are much milder than before. I now order this stuff, six at a time from Amazon and I never run out. I highlyrecommend Tart Cherry capsules to all my friends and anyone else, I hear suffering with ""GOUT""."
5,Tart Cherry Supplement,"I have been taking this product for approximately 3 years. It was suggested to me at our local health food store for relief of my hip pain. After taking the Tart Cherry supplement for a few months, I noticed a gradual decrease in my hip pain. I no longer have the constant stabbing pain in my hip that I had 3 years ago."
4,The way it was meant to be.,"This the way the West Side Story was supposed to be. Gritty, grundgy, from the street, and from the crotch. A collaboration some of the most incredible punk talents of all time."
3,Look good but difficult to clasp,"I like how these look, but they are difficult to clasp when you put them on. They're also easy to bend because the metal is pretty thin."
3,Good Pre-Meal Time Story,"There are seven stories. The first two to three stories are much better than the last couple of stories.The book seems to target a wide age group so it may be used again and again. But in terms of story telling, the last couple of stories are really difficult for my daughter (2 1/2 years old).She still likes the book. I am just waiting until she can tell the stories back to me ^_^"
1,Book falls apart,"My daughter got this book as a gift, and while the content is great, it fell apart on the first day. Very cheap. Inexcusable."
1,Horrible quality,We bought this book new from Amazon and it fell apart the moment we opened it. The binding is poor quality and soon the pages were everywhere...complete waste of money.
2,It Stinks,"Our little girl loves these Dora stories and this book is a great collection as a great price. However, the pages smell-- toxic. There's a paint like odor that comes off 'em. We tried airing it out. No luck. Shame. Not worth it to return it.If you're cool with the smell, go for it. Would buy again if they made a version that didn't get you high off the fumes. (Did you read that part? FUMES. From a children's book. Sad.)"
3,It's all about Dora!,"A lot of the Dora stories teach good lessons, and what it comes down to is: do your kids just love Dora? If they do, you will save a lot of money by buying the story collection instead of individual books."
3,Ehhh...,"This is not the worst book ever...my 2 year-old loves to look at the pictures and ""read"" the book by herself, but I am not impressed. If your child likes Dora the way my daughter does, you have seen most of these stories on the boob tube already which makes it all the easier to compare the stories in the book to the actual episodes--unfortunately, this is a battle the book loses. Unlike Dora on Noggin, the interaction in the book is minimal and the (already plot thin) story lines are truncated. I don't necessarily regret buying it since she seems to enjoy it so much, but I have to admit I dread it when I see her running to me with this collection to read."
5,Dora Storytime Collection.,"excellent book, my daughter loves it. i didnt read the item properly an thort it was a dvd, but it turned out to be a book which was even better. very hard to find decent Dora books here. it was speedy delivery to australia an in perfect condition. gorgeously illustrated an big, bold easy to read wording. makes bedtime a fun an interactive time. my daughter can read along with me an learn spanish at the same time. extremely happy."
1,Terrible binding,"""Santa"" brought this book for our 3 year old for Xmas. Pages were falling out of it by the next day. The entire book had come out of its binding by the end of the week. Inexcusable. Content of the book is cute and interactive but totally unsatisfied with our purchase."
1,"Bindings Horrible, Books don't last!","The stories are great. My daughters love them. The quality of the books, however, are not good. The bindings are weak and poorly made. Their book fell apart quickly."
3,Too basic but it's Dora,"These stories are VERY short, basic and not very interesting. BUT, it's Dora, so my daughters still ask to read them."
2,You get what you pay for,Was expecting a used book with minor issues based off the description was not however expecting to have the first 70 pages missing and the book completely seperated from the binder. But i did pay a penny plus the 3.99 shipping so i wasted 4.00 that went into the trash. =(
4,Broke in a week,"Great book for its price. Contains alot of Dora stories. However, the book isn't durable. Mines broke within 1-2 weeks."
5,These are Great,"I have been having problems with carpel tunnnel for years.I found this product and got releif.However! This product does take some getting used to, you must teach your self to use it.You also do not hold it as in the picture. Correct way to hold it is with your middle finger thru the center, using your thumb for the track ball and your middle finger for the center button which you should set up as your right click. It works equally well right or left handed. I work lefty but did not have to re-set the button settings; righty settings work for either hand.Buy it an play with it, it is worth learning to use it."
2,"Screechy, generic soprano","I bought this because Madame Vaduva had escaped my attention. Before the first track was over, I realized how this (apparently unlikely) event had taken place. She seems a solid musician, and much of the voice is attractive, but the top is quite shrill and the interpretations are, well, nothing special. She may have great stage presence--she seems quite beautiful in the cover photo--but I wish I had my $3 back."
4,Scooby Doo fan,Who can pass up Scooby Doo? Have been a fan for years and enjoy watching Scooby Doo with our grandchildren!
5,Scooby-Doo:Abracadabra-Doo,"Like this Scooby-Doo show, had it in VHS needed it in DVD for portable DVD player, was able to find it in great shape and at a great price on Amazon and it shipped quickly."
2,"Weird shadows, voices and noises","I did not care for this movie. My 3 yr. old loves Scooby but I was afraid for him to watch this one. There are lots of scary screaming noises through-out the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, Shaggy's voice is different and it really distracted me. Also, what's up with the weird shadows on everyone's faces? I totally don't get that. There are so many other good Scooby movies out there, save your money and go for one of the older ones."
3,No Casey Kasum in this one - kids noticed that right away,"My 4 year-old was 5 minutes into this movie and said, ""That's not Shaggy."" We missed the old Shaggy's voice. Also, this was a little too scary for small viewers, especially the ""Screaming Banshee"" character."
1,It's better when the monsters are real,"I miss when the monsters were real like in Scooby do and the curse of Zombie island, Scooby Doo and The Witch's Ghost, Scooby Doo and the alien invaders and even Scooby Doo and The Goblin King. That's the only time Scooby Doo was ever interesting to me, when the monsters turn out to be real and they get creative with how the characters have to react to it. The 'guy in a mask' routine was old back in the seventies. It bored me. I wish they would do it with the monsters being real again. It was popular in the eighties with The Thirteen ghosts of Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo and the Boo Brothers, Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School, and Scooby Doo and the Reluctant werewolf. And it was popular again in the nineties with the slightly darker Witch's Ghost, Space Invaders, and Zombie Island. I wish they would start remembering the formula is more interesting when the monsters and ghosts are real."
1,Where is it?,"I ordered this book on 5 August and still have not received it, so I can't rate it at this time."
4,English book,The book was not as described and I did not like the fact the sender did not communicate the book was mailed. Little more communication was appreciated but I finally got it. Thanks
5,American Indian Prophecies,"I love these types of books. The the history of the First People is always so powerful to me. So many things have been lost it is wonderful to read about them, to keep these things alive for the next generation."
2,Not very interesting.,.Why do Ihave to give you a reason for finding the book not to my liking. I found it very booring.
3,TO SLOW,"Having always been interested in prophecies I thought this interesting, but it plods which means I kept putting the book down - simply didn't hold my interest well enough."
5,great,this book confrims the stories I hear from the local elders. I have shared it with the tribal elders and it bring tears to there eyes. Many were to emotional to complete the book
3,Flawed,"The author has some personal prejudices and opinions that I don't share, but, of course, that's what most books are, personal viewpoints. I choke a bit on the way he blames Whitman's strokes on a lack of spiritual expansion, for instance.My main beef, however, is with the viewpoint stated in the introduction, ""True nature-lovers read Walden from that standpoint (the interpretation of nature,) which doesn't much concern us. It seems incidental to the mysticism."" I would disagree. I doubt if either Thoreau's or Whitman's mysticism was apart from their love of nature.There is, in this book, an emphasis on the ideas these two men held, rather than on their mystical experience. Perhaps the ideas are more tangible and accessible than the experience, but that does leave a rather poor understanding of the mystical experience itself.Given these shortcomings, the book isn't a bad read, just flawed."
3,Bad Pricing,Amazon doesn't seem to discriminate between songs that last 13 seconds or three minutes when pricing their MP3s at 89 cents. This album is a good example of this phenomenon. The album sounds cool though. I think I'll buy some of the tracks that are worth the money.
4,Great Historical Commentary of a Inspirational Speaker,This is a great training tool to use in Job Training Courses for people who need confidence and inspiration to pursue any career.
4,NEW DARK DARLINGS!!!,THIS CD MAKES ME FEEL 16 AGAIN...GETTING READY TO GO TO THE PYRAMID IN NYC....PULLING ON MY POINTY SKULL BUCKLE BOOTS...MASTERFULLY SMEARING ON KOHL EYELINER....TEASING MY HAIR INTO A GRAVITY DEFYING FRIGHT-WIG...AND GOING OUT TO DANCE ALL NIGHT LONG!!!!THIS CD WILL REMIND YOU OF THINGS FROM THE PAST....BUT WILL ALSO REMIND YOU THAT THERE IS A FUTURE....AND THAT THERE CAN BE GOOD MUSIC THERE.....FOR THE DARK AT HEART WHO WANT TO DANCE.....BUY THIS CD....TURN OFF THE LIGHTS....AND GET READY......
2,The Vanishing,Well I have to say I am some what disappointed. I didn't care for this album has I thought I would. It's ok. The music is prettty good but I didn't care for the singing that much. I like Songs for Psychoic Children much more. I would recommend that album. Psychoic Children had really great songs where you would listen to them over and over again and hyp you up. This album is just ok.
1,Poor Production,"The singing was ok when it was understandable, but the production, engineering and over all work is poor quality. There is no over all hooks to grab you. The music is disorganised and incomplete and even has a old disco song that you know wasn't sang by the group and the video from this group is very amateur the worst. Only one song is ok but like I said it sounds like it was never finished."
2,Not a good choice for me.,I am so disappointed of this version. I know The Messiah very well and also other versions of The Young Messiah. This one lacks joy and harmony in every piece.
2,Good but not great,"This version is OK, but it doesn't have the energy and dynamics that my old version from the 80th has."
2,Drive died two years in...,"the drive worked well enough for long enough that i filled it with video files. Then the maxtor died, taking 2 years of accumulated files with it. Ouch."
1,Two Drives - Two Failures,"Purchased two of these drives and both failed within a year. All data on the drives was lost.At least they failed before the one year warranty was up. But, I now have two refurbished replacement drives I can't use for any important data:("
1,Unreliable,"This drive is unreliable, and worse gave false information that it was working properly. I bought this drive for backup only; I paid 500 bucks for piece of mind, not problems. This drive worked for about 1 month, then it started acting a little funny, then totally stopped working, but still stated it was doing a complete backup. I sent it back to manufacturer (now owned by seagate), but even if they repair it perfectly, I will always have doubts. I highly recomend that you consider another manufacturer."
2,"Sorry, Mr. Coovadia","I didn't see this work as a humorous romp, other than the passges describing the familys' sense of urgency to marry off their difficult daughter. I found the characters to be unsympathetic. Toward the end, it just didn't flow...the ending seemed to be rushed and not fleshed out. Perhaps I am overly harsh, but I didn't see this book as an enjoyable read."
3,I wish I could rate this higher.,Unfortunately this book lost me half way through and I was very disappointed in how the relationship ended up. The book was a bit disjointed. I really wish I could rate this higher I wanted to love the book. I will keep it and share it with children so they can see how different cultures portray marriages.
2,Left me Feeling Flat,"I am an avid reader of Indian novels and books about the culture of that great nation, but this one left me feeling flat.The author never quite made me feel any of his characters - just leaving off when you thought you would invade their psyches.The ending was terrible - a great disappointment. I was happy to be finished with this book but sad that I had wasted so much time reading it."
2,Arthur and the Goalie ghost,I read Arthur and the Goalie Ghost.Thought it was an ok book because it did not give enough detail and it was not a good story. I would recommend this book for ages 6-9 because it is a fairly easy book to read. And it is in easy language to read and under stand. I recommend this book because it is about sports and it was easy to read.
2,European Edition,"The recent European edition of THE DEATH OF CLARK KENT is a handsome hardcover published by Planeta De Agostini. What makes me wonder is: it boasts 664 pages, more than twice the American edition! Is anyone out there capable of guessing what they could have added? (And no, I'm no fan of THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN, I don't mind the MARRIAGE and am quite in line with the opinions expressed in some of the previous reviews...)"
2,Not too good!,"Now don't get me wrong. It was as enjoyable as any other mediocre comic book, but not worth the money. Read the 'Death of Superman' et al series if you really want to see Clark die! ...and die he does!"
3,What went wrong...,"Don't get me wrong; I love the TPB. The only thing is that it left too many questions unanswered. Q1: What happened to Jimmy? His kidnapping was never resolved. Q2: Who was that guy that looked a lot like Conduit that we see in the comic after Braverman's death?OK. Not that many questions. But I think I've cracked the shell. If there's one thing I don't like it's open endings. I know the Luthor bit at the end make it open, too, but that I can accept.Other than these things, the comic was great."
1,Desolation Row for Sure,"Excited as I was to order and receive this DVD, at first viewing I was astonished to find out that none of Dylan's actual playing, nor even any of his own music, because of copyright reasons no doubt, appears on the DVD. Instead the soundtrack has a kind of generic guitar chording, that could be an intro to a Dylan song, but never is... The DVD is comprised of stills, a bit of bio, talking heads, this and that, and I've been so disappointed that I haven't really watched the whole thing. It's a kind of opportunistic concoction, many removes from the heart of the voice and genius reality of Dylan. When I look at the whole thing, steeling myself, if I've changed my mind at all, I'll do another review to correct this one. But buyer beware, it's not what it's cracked up to be from the title and the cover..."
3,Meet the faces behind the scene,I had to force myself to sit and watch this dull DVD.Although I did get a kick out of seeing some of the faces of the people who helped Bob along the way.It does sort of go hand in hand with Bobs book...Which by the way is a real gem.Has any body got an original idea out there. No wonder Bob stays quiet.
1,Not worth it,"I bought this DVD with a level of excitement at seeing a Dylan documentary I hadn't yet heard of. I soon found out why I had never heard of it. This documentary was beyond disappointing. It is comprised of unimpressive stll pictures and interviews with people whom no one has ever heard of. To top it all off, there is not a single Dylan song in the whole movie as a caption prior to the film clearly states. I urge you not to waste your money for even if you are the biggest Dylan fan, you will find this film disappointing."
2,An OK Movie,A pleasant movie but nothing special . An Ok way to spend a couple of hours . Acting was fine but plot dragged.
3,Definitely adrift,"These people are definitely adrift in Manhattan, in an acceptable, pass-the-time, not-too-believable, hardly compelling, but worthwhile film. The anomie of the city."
2,Completely Forgettable Movie,"I must have seen this film about 2 or 3 times, the problem is it's not because I like the film. It's because it's there's nothing remarkable about this film that makes you remember it. It starts off interesting and promisingly enough which is why everytime I run across it I start watching it with interest... and then a little more in the movie I realize I've probably seen this movie before, but why don't I remember anything? How odd.. well let me plod through it and see if something comes to mind. Well after this viewing it should be indelibly stamped in my brain that I've seen this before and should never watch it again."
2,Disappointing,"This is one of those movies that sound like a very good idea but don't really work. The screenplay is a little weak, the relationship between Simon and his mother is downright creepy (for no apparent reason), and unfortunately Heather Graham is not good enough an actress to pull off the grieving-mother part."
4,Good but not great,"Looks great but its a bit small internally. With all of the components I have installed its a bit hard to keep it cool. But I added a fan to the exhaust duct at the top of the case and it is cooling a little better now. It's good for a barebone HTPC case (single hard drive and single optical drive with an average processor), but I am using it for a bit more than that and its running a little warm for my likes."
1,"Shoddy construction, hours of frustration","This case has at least three serious flaws: The slot behind the bottom right panel that looks like it is for easy CD access won't fit a standard CD drive, the power LED cable is non-standard and won't work on ATX cases, and the power switch died after a week and is not easily replaced. This is the worst, most frustrating case I have ever worked with."
4,Order these for my moms old digital camera.,Excellent price and worked as expected with the Sony digital camera my mom was using until the camera got replaced with a Canon due to some water damage from a cruise.
3,nice but a bit floppy strap,This looks pretty - My boyfriend (and now fiance) gave it to me as a birthday gift but warning: the strap can either be too tight or floppy depending on your wrist size. The jeweler was only able to adjust it according to the individual links (removing a certain number).
4,Lovely watch,"Great watch, delivered on time and in good condition. Good price as well, I saw this at double the price in a retail store. Its a beautiful watch, I bought this for the missus and she's been using it for a month without complaints. People keep asking her where she got it from."
4,I LOVE my new Seiko watch!,"It is lovely, not too fancy but very very nice. The band is very comfortable. I wondered if the watch face was going to be too small for me to read the time but I can see it just fine without my glasses on. The only thing I don't like about the watch is the clasp. It doesnt lay flat when it is open so it is rather difficult to take the watch off."
1,Maxtor Beware,"I have a 250gb Maxtor. I travel with a rock and roll show across the country. I need bulletproof drives and this one is not it. I am still looking, but am sorely disappointed with this drive. I cannot stress enough the importance of having material backed up in at least 2 sources, leaving one of them at home on a pillow.Keep in mind, most, if not all computer gear is not made to travel. If you are going to drive nails with a product, it's security and outer shell is YOUR responsibility. FYI - I am looking at $3000 to retrieve my data from the Maxtor. And I did not even drop it. G-Raid and LaCie are not good drives either for travelling. I wish I had better news. But let the buyer beware. Always."
1,Failed after 18 months... needs a longer warranty,"I've had the 300 gig version of this drive for 18 months. I had if off for most of its life. I used it as a backup drive and only powered it when needed. The other day it wouldn't mount and started making a noise like a cell phone musical tone. I called Maxtor and they told me that the drive is dead and it's out of warranty. Thus, I am SOL! The warranty was for only one year. I have read many reviews about Maxtor's quality ""issues"" and now I've experienced one. Forget Maxtor, go with Western Digital. No drive will live forever but a failure at 18 months of very light usage is not acceptable. They should have AT LEAST a 2 year warranty on their drives. Of course, had they done so, they would be repairing a huge number of drives by year 2.As the other reviewers have indicated, these drives are unreliable. They look nice, are reasonably priced, install easily, and are fairly quiet BUT you can't depend on them."
3,See my other review for this series...,"Much as I'd love to heap praise on this product I'd say you're better off reading the blogs by Michael Totten & Michael Yon about Iraq. These documentaries do, however, make for an interesting supplement. My gratitude to JD Johannes for creating them."
2,Good Effort - So So Documentary,"Its obvious the film maker is very sincere. But this isn't really much different from what has been shown on TV.Bless him and his comrades, but other documentaries are better."
1,Better documentary about the real aspect of this war,Iraq for Sale: The War ProfiteersIraq for Sale: The War ProfiteersWhy we fightWhy We FightOccupation: DreamlandOccupation: Dreamland
3,"BE CAREFUL OF THESE ROLLS, IT'S NOT REALLY HIM!","THEY WERE EDITED TO DEATH, IF THERE ARE GREEN WELTE ROLLS, JUST LISTEN TO THEM! SAME WITH GERSHWIN!"
3,Good product --bad expiration date,"I've used this product for years and it's great. But my recent order had an expiration date of 08/2013, I'm not happy about that because I will never finish a bottle of 60 before that date."
4,"Tablets work for me BUT when ordering online, be wary of quick expiration dates","Buying Senokot-S on Amazon is WAY cheaper than in stores, however, I realized a problem - you are unable to know what the expiration date until you buy and receive it. My pack arrived today (60 tablets) and it expires in 2 months. No WAY I would I need to use these all by then. Going to try to return, however, as a product review only, this laxative is gentle and works as described."
4,Excellent,"Excellent content, plus challenging points for reflection both as mentor and mentoree at the end of each paragraph and chapter. A book to digest, and read again."
3,Material is so-so,The material is so-so. A lot of common knowledge for anyone who mentors already. Better suited for someone who has never mentored.
4,Plan Your Walt Disney World Vacation,This is a good planning tool. Even if you have planned a vacation before this book helps you stay organized.
1,LEFT WING ENVIRO INDOCTRINATION FLICK,"If you want to convince your children that sea creatures are continually victimized by the evil of man kind with oil spills, whaling, trawling nets, dumping trash in the ocean, plastic bags, etc and that the only good among man kind are some hippies living on the beach that start an environmentalist animal rescue organization, then this is the movie for you to indoctrinate your children with."
1,"LOVE this movie, but the digital copy is a scam!!! Does NOT work with Apple!","My 18 month old daughter is absolutley obsessed with this movie! It's so cute! I was so excited to find the blu ray with digital copy, but once I opened the package I learned it's a web based digital copy and only mentions it inside that it's NOT Apple compatible. I am very disappointed that we can't load it onto our ipad like every other digital copy."
2,Cute but SLOW:,"This is a cute movie. I have to say that it moves so SLOWLY (I found my mind wandering off nevermind my kids being bored) and there is a lot of narration. So, as nice as the story is...my kids will not sit through the movie and are bored over and over throughout. I let my sister take the movie to see if her kids would like it. She has five children ranging in age 6 to 15, and none of them liked it either. So, it isn't just my impatient toddler twins who find this movie boring and slow. I wouldn't suggest this to another parent."
3,"Great songs, not much variety in artists","I enjoy this collection of song titles, but some of the artists featured aren't ""original"" and Louis Armstrong is featured too much. Still a good collection if you just want some nice light background music for a ""romantic"" environment or if you're looking for a particular song."
5,Great Resource for Collectors,"I actually found this book in the library, first, and checked it out. After renewing it up to the limit, I purchased it off of Amazon. This book is a great education in the field of NA jewelery, and more. It gives you a firm fountation of understanding. If you have an interest in Indian culture and arts, I highly reocmmend this tome. It is a large, heavy book, dense with history and cultural information. I love the special paper this is printed on...adds to the heft of the thing. A classic."
3,Decent but uninspiring.,I read over 60 novels a year and try a few new authors along with new stuff from my many favorites. I started this book mistakingly thinking I had chosen one of my favorites. After twenty pages or so I had to come back and check who the author was because it was definitely not up to the standards of who I thought I was reading.It was on OK book but not to the extent that I will be tempted to try another of Runyon's efforts any time soon.
2,"Awesome idea, poor execution.","The build quality is poor, feels like a 10 dollar device to me, so i feel a bit riped off.If you have another mouse installed it seems impossible to configure the sensitivity of this device since it has no drivers.So i have to wildly move my thumb to get the pointer to move a reasonable amount.Fits comfortably in my hand, could have used a pistol grip for added support.The track ball bounces around in the unit, causing the cursor to move on the screen even with your thumb off the ball.I'd say stay away from this product, sadly if someone had spent some more time with this it would work wonders, but as is its a fairly poor product."
3,Just Okay,"I love the concept. I thought this would be a good product for me, because I prefer a rollerball to a regular mouse, and wanted something I could take anywhere with my netbook.Pros:very portable, can easily fit in a pocket or a computer bag without taking up too much roomgreat for cramped spaces where it would be very tight for a regular mouse or rollerballit's comfortable enough on your finger/in your handCons:long, dangly wire that gets in the waynot as accurate as my regular rollerballImperfect design - it would be great if you could switch to typing with your hands without having to stop and remove the mouse from your finger and set it asideIt has its uses, but I'm finding myself more often just taking my bigger rollermouse with me."
4,Good for the price!,"For the price it can't be beat... Must be cleaned often to keep a smooth track, but is to be expected... Happy with this finger mouse as it's only used once in a while."
2,Didn't last long,"WE purchased this as a christmas gift. It was exactly what we wanted however it quit working after about 2 weeks, so they had to find something else to use. Really disappointed that they can't make a product that will last."
3,Nice design but poorly constructed,"I love the idea of a trackball mouse that can be used without a desk -- especially since it's very easy to switch hands often, which I do to reduce hand/wrist pain. The downside is this isn't well-made. The trackball frequently loses traction, so small movements sometimes aren't registered. They also don't make it easy to take the cover off if the trackball needs to be cleaned. So, overall, it's functional and it does feel ergonomic, but I wish I could find a higher quality mouse of the same design."
3,....great balls of fire!,"... the track ball is to small for the hole or the hole is to big for the ball and it tends to roll around which limits it's accuracy, ...the finish is a little rough, ...use finger nail file to fix the rough edges. ...It's a plug and play so leave your regular mouse plugged in. So sit in the recliner and enjoy the show, ... with the price of beans today it's worth 12 bucks."
5,Works Great,Works as expected and at an excellent price! I use this on my laptop while sitting in bed. Simply plug it into the computer and you are good to go!
1,Love it - But Keystone Cop Manufacturing,"Only the first mini bought several years ago functioned well for any consistent amount of time. I bought a three pak this time. Never again. Lets see....how frustrated did I get when the first one died within a day or two? I calmly went out back and swung that mother around and then let go on the downward. Kaboom goes the mini vs. concrete. Felt pretty darn good actually. I ended with one of the middle fingers and calmly headed back inside. I am still finding pieces from time to time. Numbers two and three, oh forget it. They all sucked. That honestly says it all. Don't waste time or money."
5,I looked everywhere for these,My son bought a finger mouse last year and when it quit working we looked everywhere and finally found them through Amazon.
3,Track Ball,"Got this for my wife so she could use her laptop in bed or in the kitchen while cooking, she gets her recipes off the web. Because it is a small laptop there is no room for a mouse and she wont use the touchpad. So far this small track ball thing is working well. It does take some getting use to she likes it. Made from cheap plastic I don't expect it to last long but so far so good."
1,"Quality has plummeted, no longer worth buying","I have been buying this type of mouse for years, as I find it the only kind that does not lead to crippling shoulder pain. Unfortunately, the Fellowes brand of this mouse seems to have been discontinued. I switched to buying generics on Amazon and for a while this was fine. I purchased two more in June and just opened them -- one was DOA, the other has lasted roughly ten days. CHEAP CHINESE JUNK! It looks like they'll do anything to save a nano-cent. Since the last batch, the quality has plummeted. The wire is a much thinner gauge, easily breakable. The rubber rollers inside are tiny. The ball and faceplate do not fit properly. Somebody (preferably in this country!) needs to manufacture and market a better version -- as they used to be. Meanwhile, don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!"
1,So disappointed,"This mouse worked so good the first week I had it. I was really pleased with how accurate it worked, then all of a sudden I couldn't scroll from side to side. I opened the top and removed the green ball and all of the rollers inside fell into the mouse...there was no way to fix it, I was so pissed but hey what do you expect for thirteen bucks.I'm not buying another one I called the company and they won't replace it and I had it less than two weeks. Don't buy this piece of crap it won't last."
1,Stopped working after only a few days,"I bought this mouse because I was in a cast and was having trouble using a regular mouse due to the cast getting in the way. This mouse solved that problem well, but it stopped working after only a few days. As one of the other reviewers commented, the small piece of rubber on the vertical tracking mechanism got gunked up and stopped working. I cleaned it off and that helped for a little while before it happened again. I was unable to get the vertical tracking to work after that and have since returned it."
1,worked for 1 day,"This is a good idea but the quality if this product is not worth 1 dollar.It worked fine the first day and the feel of it in my hand was OK.Spend double this and you will get something that will last much longer.They refunded my money quickly enough but I should have expected to get what you pay for.Maybe the girl in China was having an off day, maybe it's junk."
2,ok product,ok but the track ball sometimes doesn't work if you move it too fast and the cord is too long
2,It's not easy to control,"First,I love the idea,It gives you more freedom to use computerBUT,it's not useable,the mouse(on screen)always stuck ,you can't go up or sometimes it's only move in one dimension(right-left or up-down)also,It's a trackball it's a bit noisy and 2.tricky to controlI hope if there is better version of this mouseI hope my mouse is not broken(becuse I don't feel it's working well)(I will test it again later)"
1,JUNK!,"I rarely ever spend time to rate a product unless it exceeds expectations, or in this case, falls considerably short of expectations! THIS IS JUNK - plain and simple - JUNK! The housing and internal gears are made from cheap plasic. The internal springs that keep the sensor rod on track are nothing more than a thin twisted wire that isn't strong enough to keep the rod into contact with the ball. Cheap price = cheap product...at least in this case!"
1,Junk,"I like the way the hand held mouse works. It is very user friendly but the quality SUCKS. It didn't feel right from day one, and didn't last a week. It is my problem because I didn't return it right away. 30 bucks down the tube........"
2,Poor construction,"left X axis tracking is non functioning with the unit I received. This was likely a defective model however, the internal tracking wheel appear poorly designed and likely to wear out quickly. They have a very high defect and failure rate."
1,"Neat idea, but poor execution","The trackball is inaccurate along the Y axis and proves frustrating when trying for pinpoint cursor placement. I lost my level 14 Valkyrie as a result. I am still waiting to lose my virginity, though."
1,Garbage,"reminiscent performance of an old ball mouse, x axis worked great, y axis did not work at allpoor quality, cheap materialstotal waste of money, printed the RMA less than an hour after receiving the mouse"
2,Chinese Junk,"Bought this to replace a similar Fellowes mouse which fell victim to a glass of water and no longer works.This cheap chinese replacement is garbage compared to the Fellowes one. It is made of cheap plastic, the USB connector is not the correct size and thus doesnt fit into the USB slot as it should; this results in a sporadic connection to the computer.I wish Amazon would sell a better version of this, I would gladly pay double.Stay away from this one."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking forward to receiving this one finger mouse, but when it arrived, it did not work properly. It is plug-and-play and every computer I tried it with easily and quickly recognized the device, but the ball tracker would only move the cursor up and down. No amount of trying would get this to move the cursor any other direction. Had to return it. It was also a little bigger than the picture makes it appear.I am waiting for a mouse like this with a joystick similar to a Wii nunchuk and that is wireless so I can use the mouse while jogging on the treadmill. Air and glove mice would be fine while holding still, but difficult to use while jogging, walking, hiking, or otherwise moving about with wearable computers. I think a nunchuk would be a great alternative to mouse input, wireless or not. If anyone knows of one, please let me know. I was hoping this one finger mouse would be able to fill the gap until then, but I will keep waiting."
3,One size does not fit all,This mouse worked ok but is too small for my fingers. When I stick my index finger through the tunnel it holds the trigger down. I bought this mouse because I used one a friend owns that is bigger and I liked it. I guess they come in different sizes.
2,Unit is a bit big & mouse action is not perfect.,"The mouse is a bit bigger than i expected it to be. Also the track ball action is not that accurate. If u hold it upright it works fine. But if u tilt the mouse & try to use the track ball it wont move as u expect it to. My suggestion, go for a regular track ball mouse, than the miniature version."
3,Trackball mini mouse,"Ok, not my cup of tea, never got used to trackballs, allways used a desktop mouse, this will work for people on the go who are comfortable with trackballs, works ok for travel with a laptop and when you dont want to use the touchpad or dont have a mouse surface, it is hard getting used to - but it is built well, it does work, just not what i'm used to!"
1,Don't buy this - waste of money!,"I got this mostly for research purposes, as I have a friend who is recently disabled. I wanted to find something for her to use which takes little if any arm movement. The trackball moves too slowly and there is no adjustment offered. I think this may be because it is not made for new operating systems. I may as well have flushed my money down the toilet."
1,What a hunk of junk,Ball is to small. it takes a lot of work to get cursor from one end of screen to the other. This is not an optical trackball. save your money!
1,it is very good product for a week,"it is easy to use, very comfortable, but the quality is terrible, only last one week, then the pointer stopped moving, if $12 to use something in one week is what you wanted, you can go ahead buy this"
1,It would be easier to throw your cash away,"This is the first time I have ever purchased garbage. I took it apart to find out why it wasn't functioning (horizontal right was not operational). Looking at it, I was unable to figure out how it could ever work. Cheap? No, not just cheap, more like floor sweepings. I have tossed this piece of trash with the rest of the garbage! I am concerned however. What kind of online merchant would sell this junk? Think about it before you use this merchant."
2,Trackball doesn't work,"The item arrived in time. However, the trackball does not work properly even after I applied sandpaper to increase the sensitivity of the trackball. The trackball did work better after that but it still is hit or miss.Great idea for comfort but lousy execution. Too bad, I find the product comfortable."
3,Delicate & Dirty,"A cute idea, but not well implemented. It's initial intermittent operation suggested it needed cleaning. It did, but a pin spanner wrench is needed to remove the retaining ring. One of the tire shafts seemed to be floating rather than pressing toward the ball. I disassembled the unit and found that the spring was on the wrong side side of the shaft and the shaft was free to drop out of it's mount. That spring is for both shafts, so correcting it improved the other shaft as well.Reassembled, it works fine, but that was a little more effort than the price justified."
3,Beware the cord,I have been using some type of one finger mouse for quite a few years now. Every time I've had one fail it was because of a cord problem (often times the connection between the cord and the mouse itself).I notice this particular item had the thinnest cord of any I have ever bought for this kind of product. That worries me for the future. Another problem with one finger mice is that they are particularly sensitive to oil from your thumb degrading the performance over time. (Just pop out the ball and wipe it down with 90% strength rubbing alcohol along with the depression it sits in). This one seems to me to be particularly sensitive to that. Still and all it was a tremendous price - I bought two - and am very happy to have them. The convenience of these (being able to back off three or more feet from the computer if you wish) is so great that I would still heartily recommend them.
3,nice lil Mouse,"This Mouse works fine. The fit and feel is kinda cheep, feel is ok and it does work good. Scrolling the curser back and forth seems to take a lot of ball movement but again it works fine. Would I recommend? the answer is yes if you needed a single hand mouse. for the money it is not a bad buy."
3,"Good, but a little wobbly.","This is a fine device, probably the most usable of the ultra-portable trackballs. The ball sensor, while wheel based, is adequately sensitive, and easily cleaned.Unfortunately it's design requires you to press firmly on the left-click button to hold the device steady, there is no way to grip it securely and so the device wobbles a bit while using, and can result in accidental clicking. With the casing extending further back into the palm it would be easier to grip securely without having to hold firmly on the control surfaces."
3,Not so impressed,"I ordered this item to work with my laptop because the mouse pad on the keyboard sucks and my big trackball mouse is too bulky. This item worked great for about 5 minutes. I like the size, the features, and I liked how it worked until the trackball stopped functioning properly - it would only move the pointer from side to side and down, but no longer up. I may fiddle with it and hopefully get it to work, but I shouldn't have to do that with a brand-new item that I just unpacked! Very disappointing."
2,Works sometimes,"Everything worked perfectly for the first month. Then just stopped working properly. It is so cheaply made, that when you move the arrow ball it barely moves the arrow, if at all."
3,Interesting Progressive Black metal,"Good Progressive feel to it, a varity of break downs in this Enslaved album. Has a good ambient feel to it as well. Not there best album but also not there worst, a good solid recomandation for someone looking for Black Metal with a Progressive side."
4,Interesting.,"This is my first Enslaved album, one I'm sure will grow on me in time. My initial impression is that this is a solid Black Metal outfit with more talent than most. Also, they push the songs from traditional Black Metal territory into Progressive Metal realms, which is a welcome direction considering the stagnant nature of many Black Metal acts these days. The mixture is both interesting and oftentimes jarring and unpredictable, timing shifts strewn throughout each song. While some songs bog down in moments there is little doubt that the song will pick up again, with varying results; sometimes startling results. The atmosphere is both frigid and vital, making for a strange but compelling experience. This is interesting Black Metal, to say the least."
3,Below the standard (?),"this record is good. but something about it holds me back from liking it all the way. i'm not sure what it is. this is the first time an Enslaved record has failed to keep my attention. there are plenty of great songs, but somehow it feels like they are playing it too safe...writing all the songs using the same formula. and when they do try to experiment on this record, it seems awkward and unnecessary (for example, the guitar flute intro to ""Queen Of The Night""). in the past, when Enslaved tried new things, it worked well and provided a whole different world of colour and style to their already impressive sound.most of these songs seem like they are not fully developed and i feel like they are recycling some of their riffs from previous albums. because i am such a huge Enslaved fan, i want to like this album more...but i'm sorry to report that at the time of this writing, i can only appreciate it."
2,"not bashing the album, just explaining it","I think this album is terrible. Not musically, but just as a matter of taste. It is much slower and more trebly than the black metal I usually prefer. however, it is really evil sounding and displays a lot of musical talent. So my review serves to inform, not to critique. Honestly, everybody has different tastes in music and metal, so I'm just trying to help people potentially avoid my mistake. The other reviews on here didn't really paint a good picture of the sound and I bought it thinking it would be fast and viking-esque. Anyway, it's mostly really slow and heavy, with a lot of echo and haunting vocals. So, if you can imagine a slow version of Mayhem's ""Wolf's Lair Abyss"" CD (really, really, slow, that is), that is KIND OF a good idea what this sounds like."
5,Amazing,This is one of the best books I've ever read. It will break your heart to read the hardships that Robert Sadler faced in his life but its important to read.
2,REWIND- SOUND OF UK GARAGE( MINISTRY OF SOUND),"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE MUSIC COMPILATION,DON'T BUY THIS SELECTION- REWIND SOUND OF UK GARAGE. IT IS TOTALLY ""NO GOOD"". INSTEAD BUY GALAXY MIX- MIXED BY: DJ BOY GEORGE. THIS COMPILATION HAS ALL THE BEST. OF ALL THE MINISTRY OF SOUND ALBUM, GAL MIX IS NO.1"
5,Daughter's Birthday Gift to Boyfriend,"We purchased this Jersey for my daughters boyfriend for his birthday, he turned 17. I was very pleased with it. He loved it and wears it all the time. He also received a used car from his parents and hasn't driven it as much as he has wore the Jersey!!!!"
1,I do not recommend this dollhouse,"This was a gift for my three year old. The house is all plastic and snaps together. It is flimsy and the space is very cramped. It's not easy for my daughter to move the furniture or kittens around. It's dark inside and the largest room downstairs, the kitchen, is too long, so that it's hard to reach in to ""play"" in the room.My daughter has barely played with this. I keep it out, hoping that she'll like it better as she gets older. She does lots of pretend play with other toys, but not this one. I am planning on saving for one of the Ryan's Room dollhouses which are built to last and are more open for better accessibility. These are available at Learning Express. Also, the Playmobile dollhouses are a nice option.One other thing to consider is that the furniture sets that you buy to go with this house are expensive and filled with so many tiny pieces, they are sure to be lost."
5,Great dollhouse for my 3 year old,"My daughter loves these tiny little critters and the cute tiny little accessories. This is a medium sized dollhouse that is perfect for a 3 year old -- just large enough for her to not get overwelmed with the number of rooms. She has 1 family, 1 set of twins with a nursery, a kitchen, a girls bedroom, and a small living room set and this is more than enough furnishings for this house.Perhaps when she is older (5 or 6) I would consider the larger dollhouse, but this size is perfect for her.Every child plays differently, and my daughter is relatively gentle so this is PLENTY durable.If your child is pretty rough, I would recommend waiting until she is a bit older.My daughter particularly likes to put all the little critters to bed and to kick the boy critter out of the dollhouse and hide it elsewhere ... ""I don't want boys in my critter house"". Hopefully this will extend to the teenage years ...."
5,Calico Critters Country House,"This house is so cute!! It's pretty small though so if you have a big Critter family or a lot of room furniture, it will be crowded.There is a slide out storage bin that works great if you flip it over as extra floor space for the kitchen table!"
3,ASELL,"I feel like this book has many insights to offer; however, at the same time, many improper conclusions about the reality of ELL instruction."
2,Vague and mostly useless,"There are some interesting and potentially useful ideas in this book, but unfortunately it suffers from trying to do too much. Each chapter is written by different authors, all with widely varying ideas about ELL approaches. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the book, none of the chapters goes into enough detail to provide any real meat for the classroom teacher to use. I've taught English in Japan for three years, and many of the things in the book I came to do intuitively. Lots of theory here, but little substance."
3,"Great Book, service terrible","Needed this book for a college class so I got the two day delivery. Twelve days later it shows up. In my opinion, Amazon has terrible service.The book is a very comprehensible book which is easy to read. Lots of different authorities to learn from."
1,Not worth your time,This story was boring and ridiculous. It sounded like an interesting premise but that's about all it was.
2,again? Still missing alot!,"Another year, another Eddie Money compilation. This one still doesn't get it right. So many 'charted' hits are still missing. Where are CLUB MICHELLE and THE BIG CRASH? ENDLESS NIGHTS? There are more, I just don't feel like listing all the missing ones."
4,Good career retrospective,"No ""essential"" or ""best of"" compilation is perfect, but this one is pretty close. All of Eddie's big hits are here, along with a few other important album tracks. All in all, a solid retrospective for an underrated performer who had several fun, catchy tunes in the late 70s and early 80s."
3,The Essential Eddie Money?,"Too many repeats of his greatest hits album. There was only one song that isn't included in his greatest hits album and some awesome tunes that were on the greatest hits that weren't included in this album. I was disappointed, but I gave it 3 stars because I do like most of the songs."
4,Good spring compressors,Very good product. Worked as advertised. Nice price too. The only challenge is getting them positioned right on the spring for easy reinstallation.
2,AMATEURISH,"While the story of Molasses and Janeia was entertaining, with a surprise ending, it was amateurishly written. The metaphors are very juvenile and the dialogue, overall, is simple and unsophisticated. I am surprised at this author. He has written so many books, I expected more. One would think this book was a school essay written by a teenager."
5,Miles at his best again.,This cd is great. It is mellow and relaxing. I like to play it while I'm taking a hot bath and just when I'm in the mood for jazz. It's soothing and I would recommend this cd to everyone. It is definitely one of this best.
5,Love it,"I ordered a used one for a friend and I didn't realize that it was a coffee table book. Even though it was used, it's beautiful and a total keepsake. It's wonderful and looks gorgeous on a coffee table. The photos are beautiful."
3,Oversize Book on Monet,"This is not just a coffee table size book, it is a tome for the serious art historian. Although my wife and I know our impressionism pretty well, this book has too much detail and is too advanced for us."
3,false information,"At first this book was extremely intriguing, but after attempting to comphrend with this book it was humanly impossible. You could read this book as much as a million times but it will not give you any ideas or info on how to shoot a basketball properly and other supremely important information. Choose wisely, this book is nonsense. I reccomend tom amberry's free throw book it gives you mainly all the secrets."
5,Five stars is not enough!,"This CD is one of my alltime favorites. My Grandmother used to play the Ames Brothers for me when I was young. ""The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane,"" was her favorite and one of mine too, because you don't know until the last line that the song is about a baby. ""Red River Rose,"" makes me cry every time I hear that number. All in all, this is a wonderful CD and one that everybody should have in their collection."
5,Picasso Rocks,"This author's approach makes artists interesting for ages 8-80. A combination of comic strip style illustrations and copies of the artists work is entertaining and informative. This book makes cubism comprehensible. The series of books is an obvious ""must"" for art teachers (3rd-12th gr) but kids will enjoy it as part of a classroom library or in a personal collection as well. If you have a kid who likes to draw but hates to read, introduce him/her to this author's series."
3,Battery not as shown in photo,"Be warned that the photo here shows a high-capacity 6600mAh battery, but this product is only a 4400mAh standard battery."
3,an engaging read; an inaccurate portrayal of callas,"An engaging drama, fun to read. I do not think that the portrayal of Callas as a capricious and cruel instructor should mistaken as historically accurate. I would encourage anyone who is interested to look at the texts of her real master class a Julliard; parts of that master class are also available on cd. These reveal a highly dedicated and outstanding professional, a true genius in musicianship, drama, and musical interpretation. Her private life obviously provided a springboard for the plot of this play, but ms. callas did not let her private and professional worlds affect in the sense depicted here. Nor am I aware of any history of her having savaged her students!"
3,Do Your Homework First,"Although the play itself was entertaining, I found it confusing, because I knew nothing about Maria Callas. Before I reached the end of the play, I could make almost no sense of her long, emotional flashback narratives. I plan to do research on the woman and reread the play, and I advise others to do so as well. As a singer I appreciated the depiction of Maria Callas and her students as artists who want to have something special that other artists can envy and strive for. Every artist experiences the wish to be different from those who possess the same dreams, and this play shows that truth. The sarcastic dialogue etches for the reader a distinct picture of Maria's character in the play. (Whether or not it is accurate to her true personality, I cannot tell.) I appreciate this play for its accurate portrayal of the struggling artist, but I am sure I will appreciate it more after I have done my homework on Maria Callas."
4,"A hystarical play, no wonder it won the Tony","Master Class by Terrence McNally is a hystarical play written for adults, due to some sexual content, about a master class in Opera. The play begins with Maria Callas a prima dona of the stage. She is holding the class to improve todays singers so they can become great like she is. The story has many flashbacks of Maria's life from her affair with Aristotle Onassis to an abortion she has. The only downfall to the play was the itallian was hard to understand. And some references delt with Opera."
2,Disappointing considering the talent involved,"Very ""prettily"" sung, but this opera needs much more than that. This whole performance has a limp quality to it with the soloists and conductor dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's but losing the drama as well. I went back to the 0ld Sutherland from 1959 - wrong language and wrong voice types but everyone means what they sing and the same goes for the old Westminster recording which has a lot more impact than this. Very disappointing overall. Jay"
4,After hearing D.Daniels as Bertarido at the Met...,"After hearing Daniels, for the first time in my life, as Bertarido at the Met, I can't think much of this CD's Bertarido (too) sweet voice. The rest is ok."
5,lots of slots,"Pretty large block with lots of slots. My previous one had about half the slots, but I've accumulated enough knives that I use regularly enough to justify this thing. Sits on my counter-top next to the stove, and no issues in the year I've owned it. For a block of wood, it does seem overpriced, but the price is comparable to pretty much every other block I've seen."
4,"Yeah, Piano Rolls.....","What else were you expecting? You think they had 8 track recorders in Joplin's day? You think they had digital or even analogue technology?? Heck, dude, they didn't even have ELECTRICITY! lolI'm just happy to know that Joplin's original recordings on this CD are the closest thing we have to hearing original recordings from the Classical Masters. I wish the piano roll had existed in Beethoven's day...or Chopin's. I doubt many people would be screaming about the digital conversion quality if it had. ;)"
2,Historic Recording,"This CD shows the beginning of jazz. This is where it all began. Scott Joplin is a great composer of ragtime. It is a fun CD to listen to, but it must be listened to in context of it's historical meaning, or it can become very monotonous. If you're not an avid jazz lover, this probably isn't for you."
1,Disappointment inevitable,I have for a long time owned the LP of the piano rolls created by Joplin.Piano rolls are music produced by relatively crude machines and are unable to give more than a pale imitation of the player's style.You are much better off listening to good exponents of ragtime like Joshua Rifkin than thinking that piano rolls are actual music.
2,chocolate,"The Chocolate I ordered was advertised as ""Dark Chocolate"". When it arrived it was 72% Dark Chocolate. I was disappointed."
5,Simply Excellant,"TV like this you will rarely see nowadays. No great sets or special effects, just great acting with a ripping good story. What more can I say."
3,Love and hate relationship,"BBC historical/period productions are usually top notch (at least in the early years) and The First Churchills meets the criteria for excellence. But, I found myself not only not liking one of the primary characters (Sarah Churchill), but nearly hating her overbearing, all-knowing personality. Today she would be considered a 'bully'. While I appreciate strong women of character, lines are crossed continuously; from mistreating servants to ordering the princess/Queen around at all stages of life and in all aspects, personal and professional. The script is well written, the actors are well cast, and from what I can tell, the history is fairly accurate. Unlike other BBC classics, like The Six Wives of Henry VIII or Elizabeth R, I probably won't be watching this repeatedly. But it is worth watching once. Hope this helps."
2,mostly pepper,"Disappointed in this blend - taste is mostly pepper with a hint of cinnamon. I've had other garam marsala blends that were much more complex. I have no reason to reorder this, and am really kind of stretching to find ways to use this up. Yeah, I could add curry, cardamon, sage, et al, but why waste perfectly good spices trying to improve a sub-par product."
5,Wake up your vegetables!,"My college roommate was from India, and his dad made this stuff it is the most wonderfully perfect seasoning. And you will love it too. he passed away some years ago I was very hurt. I was being selfish I thought of the food. trust me you can do wonders with this"
1,Bleah...,"First of all, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a NOVEL, it is a work of FICTION! For someone (Strauss) to be so threatened by a made up story is ludicrous. If a person really has faith, in whatever they believe, then The Da Vinci Code, book or movie, would have no impact. Faith is faith.I did not purchase this book, but borrowed it and could only get through about half before tossing it aside and will return it asap."
5,sxgj73 watch,Excellent watch. This is the second one owned. Would buy again if needed. Reliable and fits the wrist perfectly. Size is just right.
3,A summation by Jac Weller on the Duke's art of war,"""On Wellington"" is a collection of essays on the Duke of Wellington's art of war. They are a distillation of Jac Weller's understanding of the Duke developed by years of study and tramping his various battlefields. The best essays are those which summarize Wellington's use of logistics, engineers, intelligence, and irregular foces in India, Portugal and Spain. There are lessons here for the modern military professional. The essay comparing India with the Vietnam War seems forced and badly dated. The exploration of the impact of Wellington's legacy on the conduct of the Civil War is intriguing but extremely cursory. As with his other work, Jac Weller's writing style is simple and easy to understand. This book does presuppose knowledge of the Napoleonic era and of Weller's earlier work, and is therefore best read as a companion volume to Weller's trilogy on the Duke of Wellington in India, in the Iberian Peninsula, and at Waterloo."
1,Waste of money,No real useful information and mosty repetative information from one section to another. I found the book utterly generic and useless.
4,It was totally worth it!!!!!!!!!!,It was a really interesting book because it told me everything I really wanted to know about Justin Timberlake. I really liked the way it showed how they are just like one of us. It was totally worth the money and I hope that you will be able to enjoy this book as much as I did!!!!!!!!
2,He's hot! But too self centered!,"Okay I have to admit he is hot, and this book is good. But only if you are CRAZY over him. I mean u know everythin in this book already if you are a big fan so why buy it? And don't you think it isn't fair that Justin gets all these books and I havn't even seen one for the other guys. So girlz, move on! He is way too self centered! His fav song is 'God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On Me!' But I do agree, he is the hottest guy on earth. And the book is pretty good, except I know all the info in it."
3,I love Justin but...,"I thought this book was good but it had barly any pictures only a few in the middle, but this is a great book if you are a beginer at becoming a Justin fan, most of the information I already knew, so if you are a big fan of justin and already know the basics about him, this is not the best book for you."
3,Well...,"If you like Justin it's a must have. But there were a few errors in it. Like it said at one part that Justin's mom was Lisa. So, I don't know. But it wasn't a book you had to keep reading cause you couldn't put it down. I didn't even finish reading it, cause it was all stuff I have already learned from magazines and off the television. If you're a serious die hard Justin fan and you have nothing better to spend your money on, then go ahead and buy it. Not highly recommended though!"
2,Okay *yawn* that's enough of Justin,Yeah he's cute but he's gettin kinda repetitive. Let's move on people! JUST MOVE ON!
2,To boldly go,"In review I submitted last night, I mistyped Barbara Kingsolver's last name. Can you correct before it is posted? Thank you."
4,A Kind of a Minimalist Historical Novel,I received this book as a gift and had never read Kingsolver before. What a wonderfull surprise to discover someone with such a keen sense of voice and an eye for the wonders of Creation. I lost a lot of sleep tearing through this novel. I opted instead for another chapter or two of her dream-like evocation of a Congo reasserting itself in the face of the Western world. You will never forget the characters created here. Nor will you see Africa the same way again.
3,Another book about the same African theme...,"Reading this book, I realized that I was looking at another attempt to show the uncomprimising African culture and geography.The five-person main character theme was quite interesting, but the constant palindromes of Adah and naivety of Rachel just detracted from the book's content. I thought the focus of the book was to show the problems of ""civilizing"" a culture, but that seemed to fade after the father's death. Those last 200 pages just seemed to take away from the book's initial power.As I read, I kept referring to Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". I believe Conrad's tale is more direct, follows a stronger theme, and uses one character to narrate the classic story. Although ""The Poisonwood Bible"" is one of the better modern books with the African theme, I have yet to see a work that matches Conrad's classic."
2,laboring read,"I'm a native Belgian with some background knowledge on the issues at hand, and I was looking forward to reading this book. It was a jumbling read though... The observations were interesting, if only they would not have been presented by each sister. I found it exhausting to stay with each of the sister's recurring views and the view of the youngest girl was written in an improbably format. Wish the writer would stick with her own view, without trying to represent the other sisters.I have no idea why Oprah was promoting this one; was it only because it was about what happened to 'her' people in Africa? No wonder I don't hear about her book club anymore."
2,What an opportunity,"I got the opportunity, as a senior in high school, to read the Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver and I wish I hadn't taken the opportunity because I completely disliked this book. The book is told through Nathan Price's four daughters eyes and although they all have different personalities and explain their views in different ways it still is a very slow read and hard to understand at times. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get into it. This novel does give great detail and gives a perfect visual of how life was in the Congo in 1959, but this doesn't cover up for the slow read. I don't recommend this book for anyone who just wants to pass the time but I would recommend it to someone who wanted to learn about Africa and its' culture because Barbara Kingsolver describes it perfectly. Overall I give this book two out of the five stars."
2,locking key case,"The key case is made of plastic,to easy to bust and take your key,if some one would find where you hide it."
1,dont waste your money,"do not buy this product.......it is stuck and the worst thing is that my key is inside....i had to throw it hard towards the wall...but yet it dint break,the quality may be good but it sux!!!!!!!"
5,Spare Keys Safe!,Great place to keep spare keys! Easy to use! Long keys and 2 keys fit.Outside house keys and Auto key holder. Attaches easily!
1,Terrible Item,"Do not waste your money on this ""product"" (if you can call it that).In terms of security, I can pry it open with my bare hands, and it is easily broken with anything more than lbs.In terms of usability, the dial locks stopped working after a single use. I only have one combo that I use on any 3-dial lock and this thing doesn't online anymore. Awful."
4,Simple to use key storage,"I purchased this device to store keys so I couldn't lock myself out of the house. It's small, but it fit two standard keys. I like the combo lock, but it only has three numbers. Not a real problem, but different from most locks of this type."
1,My key got stuck,"There are a number of design flaws with this key hider. The one that just took me ten minutes to solve is my house key got stuck inside the unit and I couldn't extricate it. Why? Two light foam pads line the inside of the key holder, presumably so some one shaking the unit won't hear a key knocking around inside. However, that same foam also prevents the key from sliding out. If I'd had tweezers, it would have been fairly easy to do; alas, the tweezers were in the house... In my battle to get the key out, I managed to reset the lock combo. Now I can't close it. And of course I no longer have instructions on how to reset the combo. Too bad. I had high expectations for this thing -- I liked the magnet and the combo factor, even though I did worry about the plastic construction of it in terms of ""force-open-ability."""
1,A complete waste of money,"This product came with no directions. Neither my boyfriend or I could open it or reset the combination to make it work. So, now we have a useless cheaply made paperweight. It is made from very cheap easily breakable plastic, so a burglar could easily crack it open bypassing the lock (which doesn't even work)."
1,bad on so many levels,"don't waste your money on this one! the combination broke the first time it was used... almost locking me out of my own device. plastic casing. really? if you (or your child) insert the key all of the way into the foam liner, it will not be easily retrievable and you find yourself digging it out with a stick you found nearby on the ground."
1,This Thing Is Useless,Another great GE product:If you twist the cover with very moderate force you'll crack open this thing. The reason I even tried doing it was because the combination lock stopped working and I had to retrieve the key.Don't waste your $$$ on this.
1,Won't fit newer keys,"As another reviewer pointed out, this product is a nice idea but poorly executed. I understand this is not a high security product, but it offers extremely minimal security because it is made out of plastic, thin metal would be better.A more critical design flaw is it doesn't fit many modern car keys. My Honda Element (not a high dollar car) key will not fit in it, even if you remove the foam insert. The key is too long.Nice try GE. I appreciate the effort, but take it back to the drawing board and make something really usable, even if it costs twice as much."
1,Defective,"Purchased 2 of these, within a few months, both failed. The lower dial rotates, but does not spin the internal mechanisms. Avoid this purchase."
2,GE Security 001859 Access Point Store-A-Key,"This was a great product for about two weeks. Then it stopped working all together.I can no longer move the ""reset"" dial - I even used pliars and the code that I set will not open the case completely."
3,It's ok but...,"The item is as described but, I question it's strength should someone try to break into it."
5,Exactly what I needed.,The GE AccessPoint Stor-A-Key Locking Key Case is exactly what I needed to keep from locking myself out of the house. I used to do that all the time. Not anymore! I am very happy with the product.
1,Too small for keys!,"This does not fit the bigger car keys that have the lock/unlock/panic functionality inside. If I can't have a new standard key made, I'll return it."
1,Code reset is not working,"I just got the key-case, as after locking myself out once, I thought it would be a good thing to have. Well first the package came with no instructions whatsoever, but I don't worry as I am usually quite good with that sort of items. Well... not with the GE apparently. I rotated the ""reset"" wheel once and put it back to its original position, WITHOUT changing the code: I just wanted to see how the reset would work. Now I can't open the stupid box. Again I did not even change the numbers. So I have no idea what happened, and now it's locked! Absolutely stupid!!!Also, now that I got the item in hand, I can tell that the quality isn't great anyway: it's plastic, and would be really easy to break and get whatever's inside.Don't waste your money with that one."
1,Dont bother,"Tried and sent back several of these. Dials are difficult to move. Neither the first nor its replacement would work. The second time I think I just received someone else's return. Save your time and money and purchase the masterlock version. Its a bit more, but can hold modern car keys. Much better quality"
1,Not all that secure,"I bought the AccessPoint Stor-A-Key to hide an apartment key out of sight. The magnetic strip is useful.Last month I went to change the key and while the door was open, the combo reset lever moved without me knowing it and reset the lock to who knows what combination. Now I can't get it all the way closed or open. I am about 1/2 way going through all 1000 combinations to get it open again. I will probably just break off the top by hand and pull out the key.This item is a false sense of security at best. Look at the Master 5400D or 5401D as a better option."
2,disappointed,"I purchased the GE lock for my house key but after using it twice it's now ""locked' & even tho I've tried several ways to use the code... still doesn't open ...so I bought a second one , same type but now this one is open but won't CLOSE! I give up! Too bad, it's a great idea even if not used for car keys."
1,No security,"I bought this elsewhere not realizing it was plastic. When I received it, I was dumbfounded at the thought of why the manufacturer would put a combination lock on a plastic case. If you're lucky enough to have one of America's Dumbest Criminals trying to break into your house, car, or whatever, then maybe he'll sit there long enough trying to guess at the combination that'll he'll eventually give up and put the key back. But more likely, he'll figure out that all he has to do is throw it once onto the concrete sidewalk and the key is his. This is as fine as any other key case for hiding keys, but the security offered by this is akin to a plastic padlock. Pointless.It would probably be more effective to just put a 'PLEASE DO NOT STEAL' sticker on your prized possession."
2,Okay for House-key. TOO SMALL for Car Key.,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO USE IT FOR CAR KEY. Vehicle keys will Not fit inside this little box. If you can manage to chop the end of of your spare key, then you're good to go!Other than that it's fine.If You want to use this for a spare House Key, then it is pretty good. --I guess that's what i will have to do. I don't want to waste the shipping + return shipping costs just to return it."
2,"great idea, faulty design","I used this for a couple of years, knowing that it was more of a psychological deterrent, because the case could obviously be busted open if someone wanted in my car badly enough. This was proven when the combination lock quit working, and I had to break into it to retrieve my key. Also, for my key to fit into it initially, I had to saw off the top part of it."
1,NOT SECURE,I love the idea and convenience of this product. The only problem is that you might as well not have a lock. The lid is 100% plastic and simply breaks off with any force. Testing it I was literally able to do it with my bare hands. So much for security!
1,Don't buy it! This thing is junk!,"A neighbor had one of these and I thought it was kinda cool. But after I took his key out of it, it stopped working - the combination just didn't open the lock any more. So, thinking maybe it was something I had done, I bought him another one, and bought one for myself as well. Bad idea. When the new ones arrived, they worked a couple of times while we were testing them. But the first time we wanted to actually retrieve our keys, they were both no longer working. The combination which had worked several times, just stopped working to release the lock. But no problem - as other reviewers have pointed out, they're pretty flimsy, so we just broke them open. End of story."
1,Easy to force open without tools,"This thing is so weak that I could open it in seconds with my bare hands.I did so, and threw it in the trash. A better choice would be an all metal keysafe. But my friend taught me a better way to store a spare key in the car for free. Wrap the key up in bubble wrap or something so it doesn't feel like a key, then put a few layers of duct tape over that, and put a misleading label on it like ""spare fuses"" or ""mini first aid kit"". Then put it somewhere out of the way in the car, like behind the tailight access covers in the trunk. The tape and duct tape mean it won't rattle around in your car on bumpy roads, and will deter people who come across it (e.g. car repair people) from opening it."
1,Car keys do not fit inside,"I was very disappointed when I went to put my valet key in for my Honda Pilot only to discover it doesn't hold anything larger than a house key. Boy, do the GE engineers that designed this need their heads examined for designing a product that didn't consider the potential use models for which this product could be sold. This will certainly be a big looser product for GE."
3,"Awesome idea, except it's pretty flimsy and a car key doesn't fit in the case","This is a great idea. Unfortunately, the case is made out of plastic. Though I did not test it's strength, it seemed like someone with a large rock could liberate the contents. The other issue I found was my Honda ignition valet key was too long to fit in the case. I'm really not sure what product testing folks wouldn't have tried to put a key in a key lock box, but there you have it. Personally, I mutilated my key by snipping off the back part of the plastic handle (where the hole is to be put on a key chain), so that it would fit, because I'd rather have a key that works attached to my car in the event that I need one. If the team could create a metal version that's 1cm longer, this would be awesome."
1,"Watch does not fit an average 7"" wrist.","This watch claims to be sized women's ""standard"", but it cannot be worn by anyone who can wear a normal 7"" bracelet. Extremely small and the back side digs into your wrist. I sent it back after trying to wear it for 20 minutes -- it was painful and left marks. Not properly sized -- it might work well if you have a very tiny wrist, but as the previous reviewer stated it is very oblong in shape and not well suited to the wrist."
5,O Sole Mio,"An excellent compendium of Neapolitan songs. The recordings date from 1933-1949, and are all very cleanly transfered. Nice alternation of energetic and soulful, a pleasure to hear. The first track, Gigli's performance of ""Torna a Surriento"", is alone worth the price of the recording."
2,Babyface essential really dissapointed,"is imposible create a Babyface essential with out ''its no crime'' first top 40 single and do not include whip appeal single version,i don't purchase this"
4,"My baby, Babyface","I've been buying music from the 60's thru the 80's. I did not own anything by him and when my sister raved about how she loved him, I decided to buy this cd. I'm glad I did. I enjoy his music very much and am surprised that I never gave him that much thought in the past. Now, I'm a fan."
5,Evokes incense and peace of mind...,"A gentle blend of instruments, tempos, styles and harmonics that never intrudes upon the centering process. I have used this tape when teaching yoga classes, and find that it helps me to express the experience of yoga to my students."
5,Pure Delight,"This book is a keeper!Since most attempts at written humor fail, it was a rare and wonderful excursion into laughdom to read Andrew McClurg's ""The Law School Trip"". Professor McClurg may be the next Dave Barry. Whether he's giving instructions on preparing yourself for the Socratic method or analyzing the ""Horribly Evil Bluebook,"" McClurg's unique outlook on law school life is guaranteed to make you to make you laugh out loud. Five stars and two thumbs up!"""
1,not funny at all,"a person does not have any humor tried hard to be humorous.terrible book, and insane price, double spaced text, only 200 pages and charge for 23 dollars, a bad book, by all means."
1,electrolux bags,"I bought these bags because i was down to my last one. The bag #6985 was supposed to fit the Harmony electrolux, so when received the 5 bags I tried to put one into the vacuum. I tried again and again, but the vacuum door would not close. I gave up and removed this bag and put in the one I had left. with this bag the door was able to be closed. Now I can vacuum. These 5 bags don't fit the Harmony vacuum. Don't buy them. I would return them if I could get free postage."
5,electrolux vacuum bag,It was the right vacuum bag. It works fine and this was the best price I could find.
5,Just what I was looking for...,"My vacuum was given to me as a gift, and I was having a hard time finding the bags...until I found them on Amazon. Easy transaction and quick delivery..."
4,Decent bag,"The oxygen vacuum this goes in works great, I used to think the bags cost too much but the first 5 pack I got last me a year."
5,Why pay more?,These are exactly the same bags that I paid twice as much for at a local store. Get them here and save!
4,Good neo-punk in the spirit of Spinal Tap,"I say in the spirit of spinal tap because it is very tongue in cheek. Most of the songs on the album are making fun of groups or genres, just it's very well done. I recommend this wholeheartedly."
5,Not just whatevah!,"this CD is great-- and funny as heck!(in a good way :)) the ""whatevah"" song is catchy and funny... you've got to love it! I definetly reccomend this CD! It's fun and in your face and.. well.. you'll see what I mean! :) 2 thumbs way way up!"
5,this dude is cool,"I first heard this guy while visiting friends in holland some years ago now and thought this guy is cool, i found myself reciting the line ' yip, whatever when ever anyone asked me a question. its pretty contagious as it caught on like an epidemic. nice one liam.cheers glyn."
5,HILARIOUS!!! And it rocks too!!!!!,"Get this album now!!!Score ""cool points"" with your friends, crank the volume and drive your neighbors crazy with this disc!!! Also, get ""Fake Songs"" by the same guy. Liam might be the Weird Al of our generation."
1,This song.....Whatever,"This song is terrible, it's one minute and a half of repetition. How it has got 5 stars from the toehr people I don't know. Do not buy this."
5,Receiving the book Archer at Large: Three Great Lew Archer Novels......,"I had this book many many years ago and wanted to re-read some of Ross MacDonalds mysteries....the book is still in my home library. It took me down memory lane in a good and satisfying way. The whole experience from ordering to recieving the book in the mail in a very good package, was top notch! I will defintely buy from this seller again!"
5,Best of Andes folk music,"I bought this CD on the street from the group in York, UK, when there in 2000. Little did I know that the music would so inspire me to travel to South and Central America. 5 trips to So. Amer. and 3 to Cen. Amer.Mashicuna performed on the street and they were so good that I bought 10 CDs to bring back to the US for gifts to relatives and friends. While in Brazil and Venezuela earlier this year I asked the adventure travel leader, Lenin, who was from Ecuador if he knew of the group. Without hesitation he said ""yes"" and told me the group had been invited to Venezuela to perform at apparently some state function. My reply: Bravo!I have spent years searching for the next CD, and am now disappointed to learn there has only been one.If anyone connected with the group should see this review and should there be more CDs, I can be reached at weaesq@hotmail.comGracias!Grade: A++"
2,Happy Laps,When I ordered this DVD I was at the understanding that I was going to learn to swim better. However; it was way more basic than it was advertised. It was completely for someone who was afraid of water or just had not ever swam and needed to learn everything from the beginning. This was very disappointing to me since I needed it to help me improve my current swimming skills for an upcoming triathlon.
2,"No Laps, Just Be Happy","This is purely for beginners and those afraid of the water. Splashing water on your face, getting your face under water, floating, touching your toes -- basic ""let's play in the water"" games. Only a few of the 39 minutes relates to swimming, amounting to nothing more than a promo for another $50 video. If you or a friend or relative has truly never been in the water before, this might be a 5 star product. It might be just the thing for those who need a lot of hand-holding and reassurance. But don't expect to learn to swim from it, much less learn to swim laps with the big boys. ""Happy Splashing in the Wading Pool"" is more like it."
2,Didn't find it useful,I was disappointed in this video since the exercises require two people. Didn't really find it useful.
1,Thought this would teach lap swimming and turns - not so,I thought this would help me improve lap swimming and maybe show one how to do turns. Doesn't do that at all. It seems like the first step in a series of lessons - so I didn't learn anything. Still swimming slow laps. Wish I could have a refund. I'm donating this and Easy Freestyle to the library.
2,This is not Shania Twain!!,"I have to agree with many of the reviews I have read about this book, there is nothing new, nothing different and nothing nice. The author repeats himself way too much and contradicts himself. At one time he is bashing her and the next saying that its easy to see why she is adored. I love Shania Twain and I felt like reading this book was just as bad as reading all the articles of people that love to bash her. Also, I agree that the author should have done a little more research instead of creating more rumors. Next time, try talking to Shania herself, thats the only book I want to read. I have read all the other books about Shania and they are so much more worthy. I will say one good thing, the info that is true in this book is written well, but I dont recommend buying it."
1,This book slams Shania!,"This book is very hipocritical. At points it complements and agress with Shania and then at times it turns her into a cold and calculating person! Don't buy this book it lies especially about the part with her firing Mary Bailey. I also have the book ""Shania Twain"" by Dallas Williams which is a very good book and it dosen't say anything about Shania being so harsh and cold towards Mary Bailey. If Shania was really this cold and calculating person why is she loved so much by her hometown and the rest of the world? this book does not display the true Shania. It is just another Nashville person trying to downplay who Shania really is."
3,Could Have Been Better....,"I am a come lately fan of Shania's and I was excited when I found the last copy of this at a local bookstore. The book was packaged as having some new and interesting insights on her life and work. Personally, I didn't like it. It was simply a patchwork collection of old articles and rumors. He painted her in contradictory shades of hometown girl and calculating megastar. One has a hard time believeing that the woman he writes as being very in touch with her roots is also the kind of woman that would fire a faithful friend, by way of Fed Express. I think he should have enlisted the help of friends and Shania insiders in compiling his information in this book. There are some very nice pictures of Shania, but I think the boast that they were never before seen photos are also inaccurate. All in all I don't reccommend this book."
3,Don't know enough about it,"This looks like a book I would be interested in but since there is no access to the inside, table of contents, and some sample writing, I refuse to deal with it. Amazon and publishers have to get better about telling me something about the book before I shell out all this money. I simply will not buy a book unless I can browse through little bit"
1,Poor publishing quality hinders good reading experience,"This is not a review of the content of the book, rather I'd like to comment on the publishing quality. This book is an ""instabook"", which I assume to mean that it is printed after it is ordered. There doesn't seem to be any mention of this on the book description page on Amazon. The results of this ""instabook"" printing are as follows: low quality paper cover and pages; sloppy cut on the exposed edges of the book; numerous typos - averaging 1 per 1.5 pages; misalignment of paragraphs sometimes cutting words in half. All this would be acceptable if the intent of this book and others like it was to deliver classic books at a very affordable price. But! for [the price] it is a complete RIPOFF!"
4,Babylon 5 Book - Deadly Relations: Bester Ascendent,"A good read, and good storyline on the Psi Corp's origin and also the origins of rebel telepaths. True to the Babylan 5 storyline"
4,Now an In-Depth look at the Psi Cop you Love to Hate!,Just finished this book over the weekend. Loved it!!! Gave a really inside look of how Al Bester was raised by the Psi Corps and how Psi Corps is as corrupt as anything else!
3,good follow-up to great book one of three part series,So now we know all those dirty little secrets behind Mr. Bester. he's a much more tradgic character now but I find it's still just as hard to like the guy. Which is the way it should be with all Villains. While I very much liked Deadly relations it did have one problem. it handled established charactors from the previous book half heartedly and thus I was a little disapointed for instance that Kevin vlacit wasn't seen more often or that stephen walters is reduced to just one scene where he bites the bullet in what seams a scene that wasn't the pay off it could have been. Otherwise I found Deadly relations a worthy addition to the babylon 5 universe and I'm looking forward to the last book in the series. now if only we could get a book dealing with the origional war with the shadows and with the telepath war. Ah babylon five so satisfing and yet so many questions still left unanswered.
5,Enthralling from beginning to end,"I liked this novel even better than part one. Right from the opening page I found I couldn't put it down. The DEPTH that the author (and JMS through his outline) went into the inner workings of the Psi Corps was amazing. One could really get a sense of what it would be like to be a telepath living in the B5 universe. The way Bester was portrayed was perfect. At times you could also feel some sympathy for him but in the end he remains solidly the villain that he has been know to be. I thought the inclusion of characters such as Byron and Lyta was a nice touch. My only disappointment is the exclusion of Carolyn Sanderson, Bester's lover but of course, she may appear in part three."
4,The life of Alfred Bester,"This book answers many questons the series did not. It gave much needed insight into how the Psi Corps operates, and ties together almost all of the story elements from the series, and even The Shadow Within. A great story."
4,Understanding Bester,"After reading this book, now I have a better insight ""why Bester is who he is"". The book explained the motives of BEster, give me a better understanding of the great series of Babylon 5.I used to hated Bester almost as much as Ivanova, but after reading this book, I feel pity for Bester, and I can understand his point of views"
3,good for the home owner,"they work good , just not made for the pro. i used them 5 or 6 times and one breakbut they do work better then other one i bought before"
5,It's good,"The book, while short contains good information that any nurse should know before starting work."
4,Inspirational Book,"I liked this book! I'm in nursing school and it was interesting to see what ""experience"" had to say. It's an easy read, but very inspirational and good tips to ""take away"" from the book. I recommend it to nursing students and new graduates."
2,Training Wheels for Nurses,"I am not a new nurse, but I am a new school nurse and I was looking for a book to help me get organized and understand how to sort out what's important from what scares you. This book was in the School Nursing section so I ""assumed"" it was a book for new school nurses. That aside, overall the book was a series of short cute antecdotals that really could not help a new nurse except to maybe make him/her realize that being overwhelmed is expected. I think a new nurse needs real how-to get organized clues, like how to make a patient report list (e.g., patient name, age, sex, dx, meds, tx and times to be given). This was the thing that kept me from losing my mind when I was new. It's great to read about how one day you'll look back on this time of learning and laugh, but really, give the newbees some real advice."
3,for nurses,"This book was just OK, I read it as a new nurse, didn't really get a ton of info that I didn't already know."
1,FELL APART AFTER 2 USES,"I RAKED ABOUT TWO LARGE GARBAGE BAGS OF LEAVES WITH THIS RAKE AND BEFORE THE SECOND BAG WAS FULL, THE TELESCOPING HANDLE COULD NO LONGER BE TIGHTENED, WHEN I HAD FILLED THE SECOND BAG, THE PLACE WHERE THE TINES ARE HELD TO THE RAKE TWISTED OFF AND BROKE. I HAVE HAD RAKES LIKE THIS BEFORE WHICH HAVE LASTED AND LASTED. DON'T BUY THIS BRAND."
5,Very nice,I love this rake. In my flower beds I have some areas that need to raked in between plants and bushes. This rake allows me to adjust the size and length for each area.
3,Homelite 2 cycle oil,It's oil. It works. Makes the gas pink so you have a visual indicator in case you forget which can is supposed to be for the string trimmer.
1,"There is a reason this Rocumentary is ""unauthorized""","Very short, consisting of interviews with no full-length videos. They probably used 5% of the space on the DVDs. Disappointing!"
1,hard and heavy 4,i thought it sucked because metal shop the magazine came out with the exact same interviews you need to watch what you sell thought i was getting somthing different and it ended up being exactly what i had it sucked
4,Revolutionary French Armies,Paddy Griffith's comprehensive work explores in detail the inner workings of French Revolutionary Armies. The book answers many questions about this period of intense warfare; how did revolutionary armies function; how were they supplied; how were they commanded; how did they fight and how successful were they against their 'conservative' enemies. He charts the rise of the French tactical systems employed during the Napoleonic Wars exploding a few myths along the way e.g. the reality of French 'skirmishing' tactics. In tone this is an academic volume and as such valuable to any serious enthusiast of the Revolutionary and Early Napoleonic Wars Period.
4,Sargent at the Boston Public Library,"Although lacking in adequate color plates as expressed by a previous reviewer, this text is wonderful in its description of the history of the mural which took Sargent 30 years and was never completed probably because of the controversy arising out of how religion was viewed in public in 1919, a change from when Sargent started it in 1890. The book describes the history of the mural in the context of its time of diverse social, cultural and religious matters. After viewing the actual mural at the Boston Public Library, where it is, unfortunately, covered with dirt but is being restored and cleaned, one will be overwhelmed with this painting and find the book extremely interesting and full of important historical information, as well as understand why this mural is considered one of the most important pieces of public art."
4,Perfect potpourri,"If you're a fan of Isabel Allende, read this book to understand more about her, and about her various novels. Even if you've never read any of her work (I haven't read it all yet), get yourself a glass of wine and kick back on the porch with this rambling, amusing, and absolutely readable memoir. It's a heavily subjective (of course -- witness the title) account of a country, a people, and a person, and it's entirely wonderful. Expect passion, politics, sarcasm, sterotypes, humor, history, legends, love, compassion, and contradictions. Come to think of it, what else WOULD you expect?"
1,My invented country,Product received but in the Spanish language version. I had trouble getting the system to accept my new cc number. Had to try several times to get the card accepted.
3,Great Beach Read,"The most enjoyable thing about this book is the tone. So light, so airy, so droll. Wading my way daily through so many heavy tomes as I so often do, it was fun to take this book to the local lake and read it in an afternoon. I was engrossed in it, carried away by it. . . in short, I was entertained.Ms. Allende warns us in the title through the use of the word ""invented"" that she is making it up. And piecing it together. Which is what we all do with our memories, especially those of home. I did not expect, nor did I look for specificities,or even accuracies, but rather for those sorts of poetic licenses that we permit ourselves when thinking of the past.Escapist reading and fun."
2,I wouldn't bother. It's nothing like Paula,I absolutely loved Allende's memoirs about her daughter - Paula - so I was expecting a lot from this book. It was nothing like Paula and hugely disappointing. It wandered with no point at all. It was hardly funny and seemed to be just a lot of thinking out loud and navel-gazing. In this way I found the book slightly arrogant - she presumed that everyone should want to hear about the slightest details. I found some of the information about Chile interesting but generally I got the feeling that Allende wrote this book more for herself than her reader. I stopped reading 3/4 of the way through.
3,Good primer to the bible,"Introduces the Bible as more of a spiritual tool to be used as an encounter with God, rather than a literary work full of facts and suppositions. Reminds us of the purpose of God's Word, as expressed in the Scriptures."
3,"Merton. Not exactly a clear, understandable read.","I have read and reread this book. Merton's understanding and thoughts about the Biblical text are helpful, but his writing style is a bit...occluded. I have since purchase a few other texts on Lectio Divina that for a layman like me are much, much clearer both on method and practice."
4,My son loves this,"When I first purchased this I didn't realize that it was a small lego set. I was disappointed when this arrived for Christmas. My 2.5 year old son however adores this toy. It is his ""dora BOOTS"" as he says. It travels the house in an Easter basket and is a prized item that his brother can't touch (if you have younger children this is NOT safe for them due to very small pieces)."
1,Falls over all the time,"This toy looks very cute, and my daughter likes it just because it's a Dora product.However, we have attempted to make the many configurations shown on the box, and every configuration we've tried is wobbly and falls apart when playing with it. It has several platforms that the characters can stand on, but when we place the characters on them, the whole structure falls over.This toy has a poor design overall. I do not recommend this product."
2,Wasn't sticky enought for my application.,"I needed a brown tape to accent older aluminum framed windows... to make them look less bland, until they're replaced. :)The pros:+ Reasonable price which includes free shipping.+ The Brown color I wanted.+ 1/2"" width.The cons:- This tape isn't very sticky & it won't stay stuck, unless the surface is perfectly flat. Forget about it staying down if there are bumps or dips on the surface. :("
3,Not great for dance floors,"I bought this to tape our 3 dance floors, since it was at a good price, but frays very easily and starts to come up. I will go with a more premium tape on our next order."
1,Not good.,"So I bought this vinyl tape thinking it would stick to vinyl siding. Well, it didn't. Not even a little bit. This tape practically ran away screaming from the vinyl I tried to stick it to. You might need some of this tape on a tropical island to bandage a broken leg. As long as your leg isn't made out of vinyl."
5,great book---both pop sci & thought-provoking,"it is philosophy,precisely it is positivism(with slightly revised)! people who like read Henri Poincare might compare his with Ernst Mach."
2,Dissapointing,"I, a dedicated science lover, did not enjoy this book thoroughly. While it does provide some useful information, it is sometimes inaccurate and dull."
4,This long-awaited Guy track is blazin'...,"To be real honest, I never grew up on New Jack Swing...did not know it even existed until Teddy Riley brought out the 'Rump Shaker.' Then, he went to a whole different level with BLACKstreet. Little did I know that he had another supergroup in Guy back in the late '80s. So I went out and got both Guy albums because Teddy's Jams grew on me deep. I've been listening to their albums ever since, and let me tell you, with this new joint, you won't be disappointed. It's gonna make you wanna get your friends together and hit up a club in your city, scopin' the hotties out on the dance floor. The perfect club joint...Don't forget a thing about the New Jack Swing..."
4,Beloved reader of LBTK,"With the startup of the Satilite Schools, the state-side Young Trib Force is introduced to updates in the GC, and reminded of how much they aren't liked. With ""Judah-ites"" being targeted throughout the world, the schools turn out to be more than the kids bargained for. The next judgement allows for a clean getaway, and the kids are given the chance of a lifetime. If all goes according to plan, God's word could be spread to millions through the voice of one young girl.Meanwhile, Judd is left with a devestating loss, and must learn to cope. Also, a young believer continuely gets himself in trouble, and Judd is left to deal with him. Can Judd knock some sense into this kid, before anyone is hurt?And to be honest, I'd hope that you've already started reading the series before you came to this page, and if you haven't bought #24, go get it! And anyone who hasn't already picked these books up, I sincerely recommend it! I love them so much, and continue to buy them."
5,This is an excellent CD!,"This CD IS available! The interpretations are exceptional. Recordings of Bresgen, Raphael, and Genzmer are few, so to have this recording for these alone is worth it."
4,After 100+ years -- still the most complete,"There a few modern Egyptologists (and a few outright hacks) that are quick to point out Budge's many errors in translation without looking at the publication date on the book. Budge more than makes up for this, however, by including his transliterations along with the original hieroglyphic text -- so that any wannabe Egyptologist can try his hand at doing better. It is the complete Papyrus of Ani, which is the most complete text yet found. It would have rated 5 stars save for two things: Budge's organization of the book, which is difficult to understand at first without considerable effort, and the fact that it does not include ALL of the chapters. The latter could have been solved by supplementing the book with parts of the Pyramid or Coffin Texts, which Budge discusses extensively in his introduction. Nonetheless, this is the first book the serious scholar should pick up on the subject, especially if he is a student of ancient Egyptian language."
4,Great version of the book of the Dead,"Mr. Budge's book is a wonderfull translation, and transliteration of this famous Ancient Egyptian document. With the heiroglyphics included in the transliteration, one is also able to study heiroglyphic translation as one reads the various chapters. Because the heiroglyphics are placed in the book as uniform graphics, the continuity of the pictures, helps the reader more efficiently follow the transliteration, thereby helping the reader deduce what symbols mean what, and thereby adding another facet to this wonderfull volume. The only drawback to this book, is the lack of photographs of the actual papyri. This problem is significant in some respects, but overall this volume is able to clearly define all of those items that the ancients felt were vital to get one (a deceased one) into the afterlife"
5,Awesome Book!,"Awesome book!! Lots of info regarding gods that are involved in the burrial/afterlife procedures. Really cool, definetly worth a read if you are interested in Egyptian history."
3,Interesting,"I read this book some months ago. Budge was a product of his time. However, he is very unusual European to admit in print that the native Kemetians were Black Africans.I recommend you read this book with others on the same topic."
1,Why No Pix?,A pretty useless book since the text refers to 37 colour reproductions of thePapyrus of Ani itself which are not included.
3,Rating for 5th edition,"This book has some interesting points but I thought it was cheesy how the author interjected her own poems. Maybe that was skipped in the 6th edition I'm not sure. The book was over priced for what it was, even used. If you have to get this book I would probably get the 5th edition because now they are dirt cheap."
4,Used in Nursing 100,"Good book, a little wordy and ""touchy feely"". Used, but not a great deal. Good reference book for Psych, however."
3,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this dvd TALES FROM THE BONEYARD, based upon the reviewers of this link.When I received the dvd, one of the movies had been substituted. Psycomania had been replaced with Shiver.I had purchased the dvd for the movie Psychomania. I haven't heard from the seller yet."
1,What a let-down.,"I'm usually very pleased with Oprah's selections, but this book was a major disappointment. I almost stopped reading it several times because I kept waiting to discover the plot. Character development is pretty poor and the story line is practically non-existent."
4,"Mediocre, though some parts are quite thought provocative","A very short novel which somehow suits my appetite well, butthe author was not very focused on the fact that Clara died, as some parts it drifted off to some plots which can stand by itself without Clara's death. A very clear picture of racism in Carolina and a nice ending which is quite heart warming. But then again, Clara's death was not the theme."
4,"Beautifully written, a bit vague","This is a book full of powerful writing, of great depth, and I do recommend it with the proviso that it can be a little off-putting in its focus. The premise of the story is strong, and the mood building is very good, though the place to which it comes at the end left me somewhat unsatisfied. Still, it is a fine first effort and has some memorable qualities"
2,Just okay.,"The first part got my interest, but the rest of the book didn't seem that connected to it. Nothing much happened after that and I found myself getting bored. I kept reading because I figured something had to be worthwhile if Oprah recommended it. Finally, the main character did some things which brought me back in a little. An okay read, but could have been a lot better with such an emotional beginning."
3,No Plot,"I agree with the other reviews, this books has no plot. I like a book that takes you somewhere. This one never does. There was no theme. I'm very surprised this made it on the Oprah's Book Club list."
4,A First Novel shows promise,"Although it would probably seem an insult to say that this book is ""Good, for a first novel,"" it is nonetheless appropriate. Clarke's omniscient narration is intriguing, but unbalanced. The reader is much absorbed by Johnnie Mae's growing pains and attachment to her dead sister, but the other characters are only pseudo-developed. There are interesting splashes of color with Ina and Ella Bromsen, but the reader is left unfulfilled with the ""haint"" of Pearl.The novel is elegant in its portrayal of the hardships and struggles of African-Americans in Georgetown, balanced with characters who connect through plights other than just race.The end of the novel was too abrupt, but this is symptomatic of many a first novel. This is an enjoyable read, well-balanced in smiles and tears. Along the lines of James Agee's classic ""A Death in the Family."""
2,Disappointed,"Although the main characters are somewhat memorable the book fails to develop any of them with any degree of depth, therefore falling short of its claim to depict an entire community. I will say that at times the prose itself is beautiful and at times dreamlike, but the story itself is lacking. The novel just moves along centered along one tragedy but doesn't quite carry it thru. Without giving an ending away, let's just say, it ends abruptly and prematurely and at least I was left thinking ""what did that mean""?. And I don't usually miss the meaning of a book."
3,I have to agree with the majority here...,"While this book was well-written and had some interesting character, it had little plot. I kept waiting for a conflict to arise, and eventually realized there was not one. The climax of the book occurs in the beginning, when Clara drowns.I would read other books by this author IF I was assured there was more of a plot."
3,An Easy Read,"I bought this book because it was an Oprah book even though I did not know a thing about it. It not only shows how death affects people, it also shows how blacks were treated and how progress was so slow to racial equality. It was an easy read and I would recommend it if you don't mind going though the book quickly. I personally like Tara Road (another Oprah book) a little better because I had a greater attachment with the characters."
2,Not enough depth,"Although I enjoyed learning about the life of black people in the early part of the century, I didn't find anything in this book that I could ""sink my teeth in to"". The relationships of the characters did not seem real. I never ""felt"" the characters. A good book but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
3,I thought this book was slow and lacked a focal point.,"I was disappointed in the book River, Cross My Heart. I have read a lot of Oprah's Book Club selections and most of them have been worthwhile. This book was not awful, but it certainly did not keep me turning the pages."
2,Disappointed,"Oh, well, Oprah can't hit a home run every time. The ending of this book bothered me for days."
2,I did not like this book.,"It was a collage of events and never really focused on one. I mean, the child's fascination with the swimming pool was understandable, but overall I just didn't get the book. It was not what I expected and I am wondering why did Oprah choose this?"
5,"Great storytelling,filled with wisdom.","Enjoyed this book, well worth the time. Breena Clarke is an excellent storyteller. ""River"" is filled with wisdom sayings and reflections on cultural traditions of Blacks from the South. Those insights reflect research done within Breena's family/the kind of listening research that many Blacks fail to do with the elders in their clans. The story of Johnnie Mae is a powerful one with lessons for young and old. I recommend teachers consider this for class assignments. This book will take off with reading clubs"
3,pretty good,"I usually avoid any book that was an Oprah pick but River Cross My Heart was really pretty good. This coming of age story will touch you. Johnnie Mae's baby sister was drowned in the Potomac. Johnnie Mae and her family live in segregated Georgetown. Racism is alive and dangerous. Johnnie is afraid that her parents blame her for Clara's death. Each of these situations is enough to make a book but Breena Clarke manages to blend the deep hardships facing her young heroine and brings it all to a satisfying conclusion. It will be interesting to see what kind of book Ms. Clarke writes next.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of Eleven Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men"
3,Historically Good Description,"I liked the historical aspects of the book set in Georgetown in the 1920's in a black neighborhood.The book was very short and poor little Johnnie Mae is haunted thru out the book by her sister's drowning which she feels responsible for. I liked the strong mother in the book and the fathers presence, and could not help but think, that things would be better in our current inner-cities right now, if the family units of poor blacks, were as strong as they were in the first half of the 20th century. Would there be less crime and gun violence and killing by teens? It seemed there was a certain amount of ""glue"" that the author described, that held the community very tightly ""together"". The church, the picnics, the hairdresser, the herbal woman all played a part in the community and I liked that about the book. I wish that Johnnie Mae's triumph at the end would have been more dramatic and felt that the last 2 pages were under written for the conclusion."
3,thoughtful but sometimes slow book,"I always read oprahs picks. This one was ok, but not one of her best. I felt sad for Johnnie, I am not sure she ever fully grasped her sisters death. I think it haunted her. That may be why she thought she saw her sometimes. I think her mother was a strong woman. I thought the author was very good. I liked the way she used words and prose. I will read any other books she writes."
2,A major disappointment,"While the book was wrought with vivid language and a picture I could see in my mind's eye of 1920's Georgetown, there was no plot, no climax, and no conclusion. The book left me wanting and it could have satisfied my desire for a conclusion when you consider it was little more than 220 pages. This is an unfinished work. Take it slowly if you decide to read this book. The water symbolism / imagery is difficult at best to follow."
2,a good read with a disappointing ending,I usually love all of the books that Oprah recommends. This one didn't seem to have the depth to make me think past what was written on the page. I turned another page expecting more only to find out that it was the end. Somehow the story didn't seem resolved for me.
4,A Good Read,"This book is good. It is well written, but it doesn't have much substance...Good for people who have short attention spans."
1,Our book club hated it,"Our book club (all white women, in ages ranging from mid-20s to 60) read this book and we all thought it was a total dud, not even interesting enough to provoke a good discussion as some not-great books do. A good editor should have made the novelist turn this social studies into a real novel."
1,Not the best book to read.,"The book starts out slow, and it weaves its way through the past and present, which gets a little annoying. While it does have some feeling to it, and it does give a good insight to what life for african americans was like back then, I was for the most part dreadfully bored with the book. Not something I'd really recommend to people to read."
2,One of the Better Books that I've Read,This was a beautiful piece of literature that seems to have been woven by the threads of the purest parts of the mind. The author uses words beautifully and in exactly the right context. I love the storyline and the themes. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has enough time to read and not put it down until you've finished! This is wonderful and I am hoping and praying that she writes another book soon.
2,What a downer--totally depressing,"one of the saddest, dreariest books I've ever read. A chore to get through."
1,River Cross My Heart Failed To Cross Mine,"Though River Cross My Heart was an enlightning read in learning the ways of black society in Georgetown during the early 20's , I found little else enlightning about the book as far as it being considered fiction . I wasn't clear on whether I was reading a history book or a fictional story , also there was no substance to the story's plot , no real character development , and no feel of what the author was trying to say in writing this book . The first couple of pages started off with a bang and had me thinking that I was about to read an engrossing book , boy was I wrong , I felt like I was reading nothing but blank pages afterwards . I wish Breena Clarke better luck next time in her next writing endeavor ."
2,River Cross My Heart,I assumed that because this was an Oprah Book Club selection the book would be good. Not! It was a painfully slow read and I kept waiting for the good part. It never came. I agree with the other reviewers who said there was no discernable plot. Not recommended.
5,I didn't know who she was...,"I didn't know who Breena Clarke was until I read this story, and it's unforgettable! This is a sad, poignant story. Something to pick up and read for the weekend."
3,Issues not resolved,"Ms Clark has set the story in historic Georgetown, Washington DC. It was nice to read a story placed so near to home. I found that I would have liked to visit the places that I read about, and even asked a few friends about the locations. Although the story did have enough happening to keep me intrested, I was not sure where the plot was going. I thought some issues would have been solved that were not. Too much was left unsaid. River.. left me guessing. It raised some family and racist issues that were not seen thru to the end. I did enjoy reading about black family life in a segregated community and its effects on different family members esp. Johnnie Mae. Overall, a good read."
3,"River, Pull Me Under","I wanted to like this book. The subject matter and time period are of interest to me and usually make fine fodder for fiction. It seems as if the book cannot decide what it wants to be. The reader has only a nodding aquaintance with the characters, and by the end of the book must find some reason to care about what happens to them. That is a shame. Some of the characters are so interesting. I'd like to see how they are all woven together into the fabric of the town and story. Some of the passages, particularly those involving the spirit of the drowned girl, approach a kind of magical realism that is so beautiful, but their connection to the broader story is hard to make. I'm anxious to read the author's next book to see how her writing style evolves."
2,An undeveloped story,"This story had such potential, but the author went nowhere with it. The story was supposed to be about how the accidental drowning of a child affected the rest of her family, especially Johnnie Mae, who was responsible for the child when the accident happened. After the first chapters, it was like Clara's death didn't affect the family at all. It was just life as usual until much later in the book when Johnnie Mae returns to the scene of the drowning. This is the first hint that she even thought about the accident. I was disappointed in the progression of the book, but I understood it a little better after I learned some of the history of the author, whose own child died. I can understand wanting to write about an event without writing about it directly, but this book needed a little more direction and a lot more plot development. It's not a book that will stick in your memory for very long."
3,Huh?,"A most disappointing read, this book is not what it purports to be: ""the effects of a young girl's tragic death on the people she left behind."" In fact, one can't quite discern exactly what the book is about (or what it wants to be). All in all, I am inclined to think that Ms. Clarke was in a schizophrenic frame of mind when she wrote this book. It's fragmented, disjointed, and all over the place. One does not have to be an adept literary critic to see the shortcomings in this book: meaningless subplots, random events, underdeveloped characters, no focus. In all, a jigsaw puzzle with one too many pieces missing. And all this is too bad as this book has terrific potential. Ms. Clarke is a good writer and one does get some insight into black Georgetown of the 1920s. But even that is not in any great depth. A more appropriate name for the book would have been: ""A brief look at lots of black folks & Johnnie Mae's fondness for swimming."""
2,"Oprah, what were you thinking!","A no-go, girl. It isn't that the book is bad, it just is undeserving of the attention you have given it. The prose is sloppy, the characters undeveloped, and the imagery is just not there. The idea is great, it just needs a few more edits. The only character I felt anything for was the poor kitten. I'm disappointed, I expected more from your book club. Hope you do better next time."
2,A lack of development,"As I read the back cover for the synopsis of the book, I took interest in prospect of learning about the black side of Georgetown. What looks like a great book never truly goes anywhere. Many of the characters are underdevloped, so the reader is left feeling detached and unmoved by the story."
2,"a pleasant read, if not a little too saccharine","I liked this novel. However at times I thought it glossed overmany of the serious racial issues of the day. Breena Clarke has a niceeasy relaxed style which lends itself well to the subject matter. River Cross My Heart paints a graceful and profound portrait of life in an entire community in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, 1925. I liked the portrayal of the closeness of the Afican-American family during this time and the sense of community which is efffectively described. The initial tragedy at the beginning of the novel does not diminish the affectionate eye that Clarke has for small town life. River Cross my Heart is a pleasant if not mediocre read. I feel though that it is certainly not one of the best Oprah Book Club books."
1,Huh?,"My library runs the gamut and this has to be the most stupid book I've ever read. No plot, no conclusion, no real insight to racism. Guess the first clue should have been Oprah's approval."
3,Slow but Sweet,"I agree that this was a slow read, but if you keep reading you will enjoy it. It was ok, not the best book I've ever read, but far from the worse."
2,A gifted storyteller who hasn't quite honed her craft...,"The author paints wonderful pictures with her words, but I feel she was let down by less-than-skillful editors at her publishing house."
3,An easy read.,"If you are looking for an good, easy reading book then I would recommend River, Cross by Heart. It's a sweet story about a young girl named Johnnie-Mae, growing up in Georgetown around the 1920's. Her younger sister, Clara, is her resonsibility. Clara drowns in the first chapter of the book. Johnnie-Mae feels responsible because she should havve been watching her closer and she feels haunted by her sister death. It's a sweet story. It is also very short. It is the type of book to bring on vacation to read while ypu are relaxing. If you like more complicated books then I would not recommend this."
3,Several times..,I felt at home with this book. I wanted a piece of that lemon cake oh so very bad but this book didn't go anywhere and left me feeling like I was missing several pieces to the story. I wanted to hear more about Pearl and Johnnie Mae. I wanted to hear more about her mom and Johnnie Mae. I feel cheated but I am glad I read the story anyway!
4,Enjoyable read,"The term ""coming-of-age story"" is probably highly over-used in Amazon reviews. However, that's truly the best way to describe this lovely story by Breena Clarke.Johnnie Mae has a fascination with water. It is near the water that her baby sister, Clara, dies; it is her fascination with the water that almost gets her arrested when she breaks into the white-only swimming pool; and it is her ability in the water that begins to break her out of the segregated world of 1925 Washington, DC. This book chronicles a year in Johnnie Mae's life when all of these events happen to her. Through these snapshots of her life, the reader is able to catch a glimpse of how segregated big-city life must have looked to a child.Overall, the book is very enjoyable, and will be a quick read - perhaps for a summer day at the beach?"
3,"River, Cross My Heart","I thought the book was slow at getting started, it couldn't keep my interest. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and I only finished it because I paid for it."
2,"Nice try, but...","River, Cross My Heart never goes anywhere. It does an OK job of being a slice of life book. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a plot. The story wanders through the life of a young girl named Johnnie Mae whose younger sister drowns in the Potomac River. After a moderately interesting beginning, the book falls flat. We never really get to know Johnnie Mae. The author teases us with small insights into the characters and then leaves us in the dark."
1,"River, Cross My Heart","The short description of this book sounded great; however, one could read the book jacket and get the same level of satisfaction as from the entire book. Was there a plot here? Did I miss something? I, too, kept waiting for something to happen and then the story ended. Also there were loose ends that were never resolved. What happened to the kitten? Did it live? What happened to Pearl? Why did Willie have a change of heart and decide to support Johnnie Mae in her swimming? Help!"
1,Waste of Time....,"This story started out somewhat interesting but it never really went anywhere. I found myself struggling to get through the book. I kept thinking, I've got to continue reading because SOMETHING has to happen. Nothing ever did. Usually I like Oprah's picks but this one was way off the mark."
1,Interesting...AT FIRST,"It WAS interesting...for the first 10 pages or so..then I dont know what happened...there was a plot at first, Clara's death. After that it died off, and was jerky."
5,It is the kind of book to keep you reading.,"I love the book it had interesting characters and wonderful stories about each one. I liked when the 2 girls decided to go for a night swim in a white only pool and escape from the policeman on patrol. The lil sister dying in the river was sad. Unique was how all the towns folk pulled together to get the family through their loss and helpe each other cope with the loss as well but carry on with their lives. This is true friendship without color,race, or money having to be part of it."
2,Is it just me or.....?,"After reading so many glowing reviews of this fragrance, I just had to try it so I ordered a couple of sample vials. I was elated when it arrived & was deflated after I spritzed it on! Could it be true? I waited a while & yes, that initial reaction was still there. While I can appreciate the complexity of this fragrance, from the top note to the drydown, it is well crafted. However, what I didn't anticipate was that this fragrance would be an ""instant ticket to OLDLADYVILLE."" Wow....unfortunately, I could never wear this."
1,Notl pleased with quality of product,"This does not have the scent of 24 Faubourg by Hermes, which I have worn for years. I think it is very old or is not the real deal. I returned the product for a refund, they got it last Monday, I still have not received the refund."
3,disappointed by stale scent,I have sampled this product in Saphora and it was so much better than the bottle I received through this vendor.I believe this bottle is either old or not the real product. I am very disappointed but the scent is still one that remains on the body for over 4 hours and is not unpleasant.
5,The 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament!,"Okay, this volume continues from the last one, the finalists for the Tenkaichi Budokai have been selected. Our characters, now adults like at the beginning of DBZ, going to face each other in some tough battles. There's some great fights--- Piccolo, er, Ma Jr. vs. Kuririn, Goku vs. Tenshinhan, and Yamcha vs. Shen, and thankfully, unlike the DB anime there's no stalling. It gets right down to business first thing, so it's not a 3-episode wait between each battle. This is where things heat up, and the events that directly lead into Dragonball Z will begin here. If you're a fan like me who wants to check out what happened before Goku knew he was an alien, I especially suggest checking out this edition."
3,Fights,"Not a starting off point for new readers. The last two tournaments were great, this one feels long. This is mostly cause we know whats going to happen, the last fight will be Goku vs Piccolo Jr. The fights in themselves are great. Tenshinhan flighting his past, by fighting Toapaipai. Chichi turns up wanting Goku to follow though with his promise he made in volume two. These are all great, but the just keeping us on edge until the last fight."
5,Use this book to Develop Yourself,"Downside is few visuals and no color printing inside.The best book on the Leadership Development concept & practice. Should be part of any HR degree curiculum covering leadership development.MUST READ for people who want to development themselves, line managers and aspiring HR professionals.Challenges many long held assumptions and written in a no-nonsense, engaging sometimes ironic way such as ""12 surefire ways to derail your worst enemy""."
5,Decompoze is..,"One of the Best producers to touch the Mic. He is a producer in the Trakezoid's, along with one of the All time greats, OneBeLo. Decompoze, while first being a producer, is not at all a producer who shouldn't rock the mic. He most definitely is better than a lot of Mc's out there who don't do produce. If you are a fan of early subterraneous music like OneBeLo's albums, Binary Star, or the Waterworld albums, you already know who Decompoze is and were awaiting this. Go buy it and support hip-hop, you won't be disappointed."
4,Unsweetened Charm,This is an absolutely charming but non-sacchrine account of travel in Mexico following World War II. A surprisingly important bonus is a better understanding of the history of this country and why it is what it is today. Wonderful. I will read it again.
4,functional,"May look cheap, but it gets the job done. Added power jack is a nuisance, but common for the older ATA design. Improvement could be that the drive also clips to the board (like the outer case clips), but I suppose you need screws for grounding..."
4,Ac still works so probably good,Put this in my ac system when compressor went. It went in fine and seemed like good quality. Came with all o-rings.
3,Just another book,The product did not come with the virtual astronomy Labs access card probably because its used. The text does not make everything easier to understand but luckily I knew most of this in grade school.
1,Wonderful Book,"Professor Pasachoff's completed work titled ""A Concise Guide to the Solar System"" was deemed unfit to publish by Harvard University Press. Harvard's expert prepublication reviewer, a formost planetary scientist, reported that it contained many large and small mistakes and so many mistaken ideas on planetary science. He described the manuscript as ""misbegotten"" and ""beyond repair.Shortly thereafter, Dr. Pasachoff's contract for a work titled ""Astronomy"" which was three years late was summarily cancelled by Harvard University Press.The Solar System Guide used as its source for some of its factual information Professor Pasachoff's ""Astronmy: From the Earth to the University"" so there exists the posibility this this book is similarly filled with many mistaken ideas and large mistakes. I would recommend comparing books to determine which is the most accurate before buying an astronomy book like this."
3,"Great content, Very poor publishing","Pasachoff and Filppenko have done an outstanding job of writting an inroductory text that is readable, authoritative, and well illustrated. But after paying more than $150 discounted price I was shocked at how cheaply the book was published. The pages are only slightly heavier than tissue paper. In fact, all 500 plus pages, including the covers, are only about 3/4 of an inch thick. I cannot imagine the book lasting more than one or two semesters of use before being unusable. For the price, I expected higher quality, textbook like, finished product. What a shame. The content is terrific."
1,Poorly advertised,"Basically I feel tricked into buying a left hand stick. Only a very small mention that this stick was left handed anywhere on the advertisement. And now that I want to replace the blade, they have no right handed blades available. Buyer beware!"
2,I'm very disappointed with this....,"I grew up in the 1960s, and Rocky & Bullwinkle were always among my favorite cartoons. I read some of the earlier reviews which mentioned the original music was not included, and I wondered if it would really make that much of a difference. It does! I am very disappointed with this set and I will not buy any of the others. Shame on Classic Media Inc. and Sony Wonder for not including the original music. The cartoons themselves get 5-stars from me, but it just isn't the same without the original music."
5,Funnier now than 40 years ago,"The purists can argue the merits of the changes until they're blue in the face, I've been too busy laughing my tush off to worry about it.The irreverent humor and biting political commentary, both of which have only improved with age make this more fun for me than it is for my 8 y/o who thinks Rocky and Bullwinkle are the greatest animation on the planet."
5,Absolutely fantastic,"This is a wonderful collection, and technically amazing if, like me, you've grown up seeing faded, scratched and poorly spliced copies of these episodes. This, I think, is the best this animation is ever going to look. The colors are crisp and the sound is great. The shows are different than the syndicated ones I've seen on Cartoon Network: the various secondary features like Fractured Fairy Tales and Peabody have been reinserted in thir original broadcast order. The color footage of the Bullwinkle puppet is a revelation, as is the Savings Stamp segment. All I can say is BUY IT if you are a fan of the show. You won't regret it. Let's hope season two DVD is on its way, because I've never seen all of the ""Upsidasium"" story..."
3,What Happened,"I got my new Kindle Fire with my Prime membership.The first episode I watched of Rocky & Bullwinkle was free.I go to look for the second episode season one, now they want 1.99 for each one.Not fair!!!!!"
1,booooooo,this is so so so so so so awful i can't even believe someone would rate this atrocity at 5 stars. they are unintelligent
2,SONY BITES ROCKY &; BULLWINKLE ARE 5 STAR,I LOVE THE SHOW ROCKY & BULLWINKLE BUT I WISH SOMEONE ELES WHOULD COPY THE SHOW.
2,Missing Theme Song?,I remember a different theme song. Half the fun of these vintage programs is in the theme song and where's the rest of Bullwinkle's friends?
4,Bullwinkle,"Rocky and Bullwinkle are as great as every. While watching, you'll notice a smile has crept onto your face. The humor is as corny as it was in the 60's and targeted more at adults than kids--but it is still remarkably funny. They could have done a better job on the DVD's in balancing the sound among the several segments of each show. Watching it now it appears that the writers and cast must have had a great time creating each segment."
3,Won't make any new fans...,"...But if you are already hooked on the Moose and Squirrel, you should probably buy this. Yeah, season one wasn't the best (animation even cheaper looking than it was in later seasons), and the non-story parts of the DVD (intros, etc.) are hacked to bits, but if this one doesn't sell, there'll be no reason for them to, a, release the rest of the canon or, b, listen to the legitimate complaints about this set and do better next time.Also, the Peabody and Sherman's on this disk are probably worth the cost on their own."
3,"Great show, presentation could be improved","I'm not old enough to have seen this when it originally aired, but I watched it on tapes when I was little and it's an incredibly funny show; if you're not familiar with it, I recommend checking out some of the good lines in the imdb, such as:Natasha Fatale : Boris, is Moose you said you killed in previous episode?Boris Badenov : Look, it's his show. If he wants to be hard to kill, let him.Rocky : Bullwinkle, do you know what an A Bomb is?Bullwinkle : Sure, a bomb is what some people call our show.Rocky : I don't think that's very funny.Bullwinkle : Neither do they apparentlyI take off 2 points because there are no captions or subtitles, and the navigation system is not the best."
2,Rocky and Bullwinkle full of redundant clips,"I love Rocky and Bullwinkle. But this package containes every minute of every broadcast. This means that you have to sit through the same opening, middle and ending credits clip each time you watch a broadcast. Get ready to use the fast forward button."
5,Fun series,"Didn't like all of this program growing up, but for some reason it seems better. It seemed boring before, but I haven't looked at all yet."
2,Altered History,"I am FED UP with those who just can't resist the temptation to MESS AROUND with historical documents. WHY did the producers of this set feel the need to ALTER the title sequences? WHY did the producers of this set feel the need to ALTER the music? The reasons I have heard sound dubious and inadequate. If there were unavoidable copyright issues involved I can see where there MIGHT be a decent excuse. Otherwise there is NO excuse. After seeing the JARRING modern insert of the new title and hearing the changed music intros, I found myself suspicious of the rest of the contents of the set. I couldn't help but wonder if the cartoons themselvesd had been ""altered"". This same problem infected the Underdog sets. For pete's sake, LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE!!!"
3,They CHANGED the music!!!!!!!!!,"What an irritant. I love the series and enjoy the shows immensely. I even purchased several sets and gave them as gifts BEFORE seeing it myself! I trusted them too much.I am severely dissappointed that they changed the music from the original. I actually anticipate the moments when they use the ""new"" music and fast forward through them.Sad commentary on how one views a classic show!Sorry guys, you shouldn't have messed with ""memories"". It really leaves a black mark on your tribute to R & B.I actually find myself apologizing to the people I gave these to as gifts that it isn't true to the original."
2,STOP MESSING WITH THE BACKGROUND MUSIC!!!,"I just love Bullwinkle, and the treasures on this disc would easily merit five stars, if it wasn't for the producers' tampering with the cartoons themselves. Nearly all of the original background music in the cartoons themselves have been replaced with unauthentic, unspectacular & intrusive canned music. Worse, some short scenes have had music added where none existed before.I cannot understand why they would have done this, except maybe the producers couldn't guarantee that they had all of the proper clearances to avoid a possible lawsuit with some music writer. That would be understandable, except for when they tampered with scenes that called for trumpets or bugles, which lasted 2 or 3 seconds. Do they really think someone will file a lawsuit over a 3-second bugle call?!If they do a volume 4 and they have to remove the music, please don't bother finding replacement music. Just leave the vocals and I'll understand."
5,An Interview with June Foray please!,"Rocky and Bullwinkle! Boris and Natasha! Moose and Squirrel! Fractured Fairy Tales! Etc., etc. How I remember this show! The humor was always top class! This is one of the formative influences from my childhood. I would hope that they could get interviews with some of the talent who made this series. At least, June Foray(the voice actor for Rocky, Natasha Fatale, and innumerable witches, fair maidens, etc.)Update: Have received it and it IS a good set! The video remastering is excellent, I believe. Rocky and Bullwinkle have their normal healthy coloring. The puns are as bad as you remember them including some you probably didn't get the first time around-hence the appeal of this series to adults as well as to children!"
2,"""BOOO!!! The Original Music Is Missing!""","I remember ""R&B"" when I was little and one of most striking things about it was hearing that zany theme. So imagine my enthusisam when I received the ""Season One"" DVD set as a gift. Then imagine my disappointment when descovering that the original music was replaced by OTHER music! I never played my ""R&B"" DVD again after that. Without the zany orignial music--""Hokey Smokes""it's not Rocky & Bullwinkle!!"
3,It has a BUG in the lower right hand corner!!!,"I love Rocky and Bullwinkle and I'm glad they finally released it on dvd and in a Season boxset to boot, but be warned, these dvds have a BUG (a semi-transparent gray ""R&B"" logo on the lower right hand corner) on them. This bit of branding copied from cable tv stations is quite annoying, even though the Bug itself is fairly innocuous and only lasts for about 10-30sec at the beginning of each segment.Still, this is the first foray of placing a bug on a dvd. If it does well, there will definitely be others and possibly (likely?) far more distracting."
3,"Let's paint over the ""Mona Lisa""","As mentioned above, the maker of this DVD has made title changes, music changes, plus narrator Bill Conrad's voice appears to have been badly redubbed in the first episodes by another actor, and the early episode laugh tracks are missing. What is this? This is a historical document these DVD producers are screwing with. Tampering of this sort simply defaces a cultural artifact and lessens the value of the package. Which Philistine was running the show on this release? If the intent was to cater to the nostalgia crowd, how does releasing it in an altered form serve that end? This set is indispensible for a lot of us, so we'll buy it--but it's a bitter pill to swallow when you purchase a da Vinci only to find the canvas has been altered by LeRoy Neiman."
2,"Moose Good, DVD Bad","I love Rocky & Bullwinkle, it reminds me of my childhood. When I saw this wonderful DVD set I thought to myself, ""Yes, I finally get to see the shows in the proper order."" Because I never watched it in the right order as a kid. I was dumbfounded and dismayed when I played it and found that it had been watermarked with an R&B in the corner of the screen. The fact that it blinks on and off is extremely distracting. I would expect this on TV, they do it to make you buy the DVD. But, this is outragous. It is still the only DVD set of Season 1 of Rocky & Bullwinkle, so I guess its better than nothing (but not by much)!"
3,the introduction music is not the same,"they lied about"" complete seasons"" the theme music at the beginning and the end of ALL of the cartoons has been changed. so if your memory is jogged when each cartoon begins, your mind is fine- YOU are getting something different than the original series theme music. I'll get over it although it has been a big disappointment other than that the cartoons are great!!"
4,Rocky & Byllwinkle & Friends - The Complet First Season,Doesn't have the same effect as it had when watching as a child but still entertaining.
5,It's a Classic,"The episodes are hilarous, getting 26 1/2 hours with all the additional characters makes this not only a great collector's set - it is also an amzing value - compared to some of the other ""so-called"" classics out there for a lot more $.Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, Sherman, Peabody - on and on - hours of hilarious fun - the people complaining about the ""R & B"" bug or the music or any other minor detail should get a life and enjoy the fun - it's the shows that matter and here you have them - so enjoy- I can't wait for season 2."
2,Rocky and Bullwinkle,Great reminder of childhood television; a little more repititious than as I recall as a kid...but still fun...
3,Will our heroes succumb to modern annoyances?,"Yes, yes they will. I hate, hate, hate watermarking and will not buy this set since I have been warned about it. It is incredibly irritating and distracting. Probably the major reason I do not have cable and buy so many DVDs. It is almost as bad as commercials (not referring to trailers, I like my previews) in front of movies and on DVDs. You want to talk about upset? It was when I came across a DVD that forced you to watch commercials. You could not even fast-forward, it was blocked!OK, I'm better now. I never really cared for Rocky and Bullwinkle when I was a kid. Way over my head, I guess. Rediscovering them a couple decades later was great. The writing is clever and extremely funny. I would suggest if you ignored them as a kid (and can ignore the watermarking), to check them out. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I."
4,One of the Best Cartoons,"I give the series 5 stars and the extras 3 stars. The series is well written and the satire is stinging which can go over the head of younger viewers. Part of the charm of Rocky and Bullwinkle was it's tongue and cheek look at the cold war. Watching Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends without knowing anything about the cold war is like watching Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida without knowing anything about the Iliad; you could watch both and go around saying ""Huh?"" The baby boomers may understand the series but generation X won't. Which makes the extras so lacking; if and only if the extras contained some background information about the cold war then Rocky could open up a new generation of fans."
5,A great foundations-of-the-faith book,"This book is a great foundational manual. Alistair has a way of bringing the truth out in the open and not apologizing for it. This book is appropriate for both veteran Christians, new believers, and those seeking God."
2,"It's nice to have a dead-tree edition, but it's nothing new.","Some of the editorial text of this book is new, but most of the content you'll be able to find all across the Net (in the form of the original Incunabula papers) for free. The text of those documents makes up most of this particular book. There's nothing that says that you can't print those out if you've a mind to, if only to save some money. Unless you're a hardcore researcher of the Ong's Hat mystery or a collector of unusual books, you're probably better off printing them out to make your own edition. You won't be missing too much."
3,Interesting tease,"I generally enjoy what Peter Moon's into and his take on things, and the topic matter for this book is not only the most bizarre, but also potentially the most significant. Unfortunately, like the other reviewer said, not much original content here that you otherwise could find for free online, and much re-hashing to create more volume for the book in my opinion. Having said that, it may be an introduction to one of the most incredible events of modern times, and a real peek into the extent of the global conspiracy. And of course what I'm referring to is time travel and time manipulation without so-called ""alien intervention""."
2,Good reading.....for sci fi,"For the past few years, I've had a great interest in the Ong's Hat/Incunabula mystery. I was very excited when I saw the book was released.The book is ok written. Don't expect a pulitzer. Its an interesting story. It has a few mystery and intrigue elements. But I highly recommend that you check your sense of realism and disbelief at the door.The book has some incredible outrageous moments and expect the reader to believe it.Overall its a fun book, definitely a keeper for conspiracy buffs, but don't expect too much out of it. I've yet to meet anyone who can convince me that a fraction of this is real (with the exception of the town being in NJ)."
3,Same thing,"Well as the first reviewer stated happened to me as well. This review was not available when I ordered so we must have ordered at the same time.I ordered blueberry and apple cinnamon.Not only was the number of items incorrect, I did not even receive apple cinnamon, they substituted strawberry instead.When I emailed they did offer to replace the items if I shipped them back. My father wanted them so we kept them. I definitely would have been happier if at least a small gift certificate had been offered.Not real sure I'd order from them again, especially since I am the second customer to review with problems.However the food was packaged well and tasted quite good."
4,Fun froth.,"This is fun fantasy, somewhat reminiscent in tone to Heinlein's Glory Road. Like Heinlein, Weber is a SF writer who turns to fantasy with a light touch. A useful antidote to the Jordans of the fantasy world. My major complaint is the phony scotch accents. Weber does not have a very good ear for accents and muddling through the dialogue gets old. (He had the same problem with Scotch accents in Crusade. What is it with this guy and that accent?)"
4,Great book,Well told story and very enjoyable. Oath of swords is one of my favorite books. I am a big fan
2,Book,Was ok book just not a great plot or action to keep you into the book. Slow and uneventful. readable
5,Great Adventure,"I loved the characters of Bahzell and Brandark. The reluctant hero and his friend the wanna-be bard. A wonderful story with great characters, and some good humor."
3,Oath of Swords,"Not much character development and too many loose ends, but a good story line. It was enjoyable while it lasted."
3,Ok but not up to Weber's high standard,"I just finished this book. To use a Weberism: as a fantasy author, Weber makes a very good space opera author.Weber's style in this book is very reminiscent of Terry Brooks (read the ""Magic Castle"" books or ""Sword of Shanarra"" series.). Fans of Brooks will probably like this book.Fans of Weber's space operas might appreciate them as an interesting addition to the Honor Harrington series. In fact, a few of the ideas in THIS book made it into the Harrington books (e.g. Clinkscales being ""sept"" to Harrington Steading). So it could provide some background material for readers of his more popular work.As stand alone fantasy it's ok, but but not great. A good beach read. The plot has some unfortunate holes, and a major plot thread is effectively set aside with a ""report from afar"" that ""it all worked out OK."" (To be fair, I haven't read the other books in the series so this might be ""fixed"" later on.)"
3,It's ok,Not the best nor the worst. It doesn't really grab you but for a free book to use while sitting in your daughters dance class it's ok.
4,Good story,"Nice way to establish the main character as a noble honorable character and the ""bad guy"" is totally unredeemable. Nice way to follow the whole hero's journey."
5,"An Exciting, Funny Novel of Good and Evil","So many fantasy novels of good and evil have no humor in them. David Weber creates a very readable story that has humor, a strong protaganist, a side kick who doesn't hesitate to disagree with the hero, and several wonderful villians. I have lost count of how many times I have read this book while waiting for the sequel to come out. When you've finished with ""Oath of Swords,"" get the sequel ""The War God's Own"". Any hero who argues with God on a regular basis gets my vote. (Sometimes, the hero even wins the arguement.)"
4,Good fantasy from Weber,"I was reluctant to start these books [Oath of Swords and the Wwar God's Own]. I've read almost all of his other books, but was suspicious about turning to fantasy. I shouldn't have been. The books are very different from his others (although the experience in military things still shows) but they are a good read and definitely on my ""to be re-read soon"" list. I found one major negative point: I do wish he'd avoided the stereotyped elves, dwarves, halflings etc. (although to be fair the individual representatives of the races we meet /aren't/ much like the stereotypes, and he has a couple of original races as well). However, the humour more than makes up for that, especially when the protagonist is argueing with his god (and sometimes winning the arguments!). I'll be very interested to see how this series continues..."
4,Fun and frothy.,"Those of us who got to know David Weber through his military SF (see, esp., the excellent though interminable Honor Harrington series) likely will be surprised to discover his new fantasy series (does he ever write stand-alones?). Unlike the Honor Harrington series, which can be awful serious in places, Oath of Swords is just plain fun. (There is an analogy some have noted with Heinlein's Glory Road. Like Heinlein, Weber is a hard SF writer who turned to fantasy and demonstrated a light touch.) As with others, my major complaint is that Weber does not have a very good ear for accents. I agree with those who said his scotch accents especially get old. Having said that, it is still very highly recommended."
4,Reluctant Champion,"What happens when the god of war and justice chooses as him champion a person who does not want to be a champion and who has little time for gods? For good measure, the champion is of a race despised by all the others. The result is a good story of good versus evil.Bahzell, the hero, is not a bad person. In fact he is extremely good. He's stubborn too. He doesn't want to listen to the priests who try to bring him messages and neither does he want to listen to the god himself. He has enough trouble trying to keep himself out of trouble without sticking his nose into other nations' business. He is aided in his adventures by a best friend who is from the city of his hereditary enemies and who wants to be a bard. Unfortunately, he cannot sing. Fortunately, he is good with a sword.This is a fun book in the fantasy realm but the fantastic is not too strong. Mostly, it is good versus evil."
2,What happened?,"Got my package. Only received(1) 10 song-CD of a 2-CD, 22 song album package. How come? Disappointed at receiving only half of my order. Is this typical?"
5,In God's Care : Daily Meditations on Spirituality in Recovery (Hazelden Meditation Series),Beautiful meditations for those in recovery...simple and direct. A welcome addition to my morning quiet time. I'm blessed to have been guided to this book.
5,Meditation Book,Purchased as gifts for friends. Great gifts that are being well received. Have several left to give for special occasions.
2,Don't buy it!,"It sure looks great but looks are deceiving in this case. I purchased this printer and now after printing a grand total of 200 pictures it has died. The power supply is definitely junk and when it does turn on the paper feed jams. I get 2-3 misprints for every decent print and after a few months the pictures I printed and put up on the fridge have faded (despite using expensive 'high quality' HP paper and ink). Essentially, this machine is good for people who like to torture themselves with shoddily built products, not for a person who expects quality. You will save money if you avoid it, and unlike the fading printout pictures on my fridge, the ones beside them printed through a web service have continued to be glossy and top notch. Save your money. Next time I will go with Canon or just stick with web service prints...surprisingly less expensive and much better quality when all points are considered. Good Luck! I hope this has been helpful!"
4,Not for Windows ME,"This is a great little printer, but be forewarned. If you want to use it with a PC, there are two discs that come with it. One is labeled Vista, the other 98, ME, 2000, XP. I have an ME PC. When I tried to load the ME disc, it said it REQUIRES XP. So, if you want to use it directly with a camera (the memory card from the camera), you're OK. But if you need your PC and it has 98 or ME, forget it!"
4,Small and Handy,Like most HP printers this product is well-engineered and performs its function admirably. It is stylish with a small footprint and works well as a companion to my HP 1020 Laser Printer. The only complaint I have is the software that comes with it can be annoying. It will pop-up at inopportune times and isn't overly intuitive. Pretty much a standard HP product with excellent hardware and sub-par software.
2,HP A616 Photosmart Compact Photo Printer,"I am somewhat disappointed that the printer is not a stand alone portable.My previous portable printer was capable of enhansing photos and I find that this one does not have that capablility. I am having a problem with the quality of the prints and will have to contact HP as the blue sky and the gray concrete has a reddish hue and I do not know if it is a problem with the printer or the ink cartridge, but I will contact HP to solve this problem. Photos can only be enhanced when the printer is connected to the PC. I feel that this is a negative feature of this printer."
5,Great Printer,I purchased this printer and loved the results. Like the other comments stated it was very east to operate. If there is something that is not clear just refer to the manual and it will help you out. Printing out a 5x7 photo is easy and the results come out great. This is a good printer that is worth the price.
3,This book is OKAY,"I got this book from my best friend for my birthday. I was so excited! I love 'N Sync and JC is my favorite, but I have to admit, I was pretty dissapointed. Almost everything in the book is stuff I already know. It's quite obviouse the author got all her information from magazines. And she only talkes about JC part of the time. The rest is all about astrology and stuff like that. So, if your a die-hard JC fan or you like to read the same stuff over and over again, get the book. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
1,The author of this book knows nothing about JC.,"Reading this book was a complete waste of time. Because the author obviously knows so little about her subject, she spends chapters discussing numerology and Chinese birthdays. It's ridiculous! When she did actually put forth ""facts"" rather than her own wacked out hobbies, the ""facts"" weren't necessarily true. Additionally, she seems to pull most of her information from teen magazines. Anyone can do that kind of research. Don't waste your money on this book!"
5,JC is hot hot hot!,"This book taught me a lot about JC that I did not know. He isone of the sweetest, nicest, and sexiest guys on earth!"
5,lower radiator hose,"Fit and looked like the original. good price considering what some places were asking for this hose. These hoses seem to last a long time, I was replacing as preventive maintenance."
5,Better than Frank Sinatra,"Jimmy, 10 years younger than Frank, sings better now than Francis ever did. John Travolta has been signed to play Jimmy in the movie based on his biography, ""Making the Wise Guys Weep."" Jimmy is the best singer you never heard of, but after the movie everyone will want to buy his music."
4,HOT REQUEST CD,"I play ""oldies"" songs on our local radio station and ""When your old wedding ring was new"" draws multiple requests. People are constantly asking ""who is this guy"" and ""where can i buy the CD"". Other songs do pretty well but ""Wedding Ring"" wows the older ladies set day in and day out. Personally, I really like his style...great barroom singer. gmc"
5,The Old Songs and Singers,"I am in my sixties, and I think the old songs and singers are the best. The words, the phrasing, the clear pronunciation, and the singers' expression are hard to beat. This was a great CD."
5,It's great!,I strongly recommend it if you are Catholic looking for having a Catholic traditional home...
1,Very poor sound quality,"Can't understand why anybody could accept this as a DVD qualityvideo, as it is equally poor on sound as it is in videodon't wast your time"
2,Better than nothing but still looking for the real thing!!!,I have been looking for their concert in DVD for years.... have seen them live 6 times through the years and the T-shirts and memories is all I've got!! Don't they know how much $$$ they could make by coming out with the real DVD?? I am still hopeful that they will tour back and will finally release the DVD like all other artists!
3,doesn't fit Glock,"I have another model which fits my Sig perfectly. But this one does not fit my glock. Tried adjusting all the screws, but can't get the Glock to fit properly."
4,dont get it wet,"I love the watch. I own several high-end. Thinking this was water-resistant, it is not. Wear it in the shower at your peril. A Fog develops inside the casing, it really is quite annoying. Otherwise, a great watch. Looks fab, your friends think you rock. Just don't swim it."
1,Buyer Beware!,"We bought this watch thinking we got a great deal. But be advised, you get what you pay for. At first, after only a month, the battery lead became detached, and we had to send it in twice for repairs. We had to wait a month to get it back and pay for shipping. Once again, the timer has now quit and now the watch is full of condensation. So much for water proof! This watch is too expensive for the headache that comes with it FREE! I will never buy another Movado."
2,Floyd Who?,"Not many guitars use Floyd Rose tremolos nowadays (Ibanez is the only exception). I bought this book just in case I had to set up any of this Japanese/Korean/etc models but... this book deals primarily with original Floyd Rose tremolos (?!) which are not easy to find in any guitar in 2010. Do not pay too much for this book, it's a small book with basic information you can find somewhere else. Good for installing a tremolo though, if you have to do this job."
1,UNeducational book that lacks nuance or depth,Jasper grabs the wrong end of the stick. It is not the UN that needs exposure but the US government's approach to the world body.
1,murderous thug,"I used to live in Appleton, the hometown of the Bircher's. I picked this book up at a used bookstore, and later resold it about a year ago. What really stood out for me was when Jasper TWICE--without any explanation--called Nelson Mandela a ""murderous thug."" Take that for what it's worth. read the book for all I care."
3,And you thought they stand for World Peace,Why are there foreign troops training within the US? It has been observed with increasing frequency that foreign trops are engaging in urban warfare training within the US. Why is it necessary that they train here? This read will give you a good look at why they are here.
5,The best exposé of UN,Notice how the detractors of this book just ridicule the author and publisher. No refutation of any facts in the book.This is the best exposé of the UN to read. Reveals the whole Agenda 21 scheme long before it became a direct threat to our liberty.
4,WORLD PEACE,"I found this book to be very one sided. The author is trying to prove his point that the UN is some type of poison being fed to the rest of the world as a form of candy. He accused the UN of wanting to do away with small governments and create a world government. By using examples such as the international criminal court treaty, a treaty in which anyone can be brought to a world trial. Though it did open my eyes to things they don't teach you in high school, i found myself a little uneasy by the time i got to the 2nd chanpter. If all the author is saying is true. well then i think the US needes to make a drastic decision and pull itself right out of the UN. But then again the author could be completely over ananalyzing the world we live in simply trying to unify itself. And i see no harm in doing that."
1,garbage,"as i said on the tr rocks interview, here it is again. someone made a very bad or desperate deal where these budget combo things keep popping up again and again, different country, different name, same basement 80s metal treatment of his stuff..its sad to see such reverb laden riffage ruin such great tunes....this is not a todd rundgren album, its a mistake that he agreed to that keeps coming back to rip someone new off who doesnt know better..stay far far away from any of these projects"
5,Awesome bags,"If you have any type of allergies these bags are for you. They really prevent and filter allergens. They are thick, easy to install and last a long time. And I love my electrolux vacuum."
2,"Fake ""Electrolux S-Bag Clinic Anti-Allergy Vacuum Bags","This order was filled by B & M housewares, Brooklyn N.Y. & was most disappointing. Instead of getting the advertised item, I received a bag (not Electrolux packaging) of bulk packaged bags designated ""MicroFine Electrostatic Filter"" of approximately S-Bag style, but instead of the Electrolux ""sliding door"" to close bag at end of use, there is a cheap piece of tape which can be uncovered & used to plug the hole.On complaining, I was given a 50 % refund by B&M; Housewares.These may work fine, I don't know. However, should this happen again with an Amazon order, I'm sending it back, no matter how much trouble. Amazon book & Kindle orders are great. The things sold through associates may be questionable & tend to have high shipping costs, in my experience.Caveat emptor!!!"
3,"Good, but small and pricey","These bags work well, they do not rip and do not let any dust past them. The tab for the sliding hole cover breaks off easily. I now try to get the sliding cover moving on the new bag before I install it into the vaccuum.If you own Electrolux EL 7020B Oxy3 Ultra Canister Vacuum, there is not much choice, but to buy these bags."
3,"Vacuum Bags, Great! Delivery, ???","We ordered these bags at the same time we ordered the Electrolux vacuum in March. Vacuum was delivered as promised in April, bags followed in June, 2 months late! We used the 2 bags that came with the vacuum and placed a 2nd order for the bags from a 3rd party through Amazon and received that order in 2 weeks while the original order was still languashing. Amazon did email saying that the order was going to be delayed until November and we were thankful that they came 4 months early just the same. The only advantage to the delayed order was that there was no charge for it's delivery."
5,great product,"I love this little Harmony vacuum an I really love the bags which filter the allergens from my air, I have allergy related asthma and it makes a difference in the air I breath!"
5,"Electrolux S-Bag Anti-Allergy Vacuum Bags, Set of 4",Love the fact that I get the right bags for my vacuum cleaner and don't even have to leave home. They were shipped right away and I had them when I needed them. They're great for filtering out the dust and dander that go with our large Newfoundland's dog hair.
2,Got something else / Be warned,"I ordered the S-bag CLINICs (Model EL202B) based on the picture, which I always use, but got S-bag H10 Anti-Allergy bags (EL202F) instead. I should have read and compared the product details. The bags I got don't look like the ones in the product picture. The bags I got are made of Polypropylene, which is not as good for the environment as the paper ones.On the package it doesn't say that they fit my vacuum cleaner UltraSilencer EL6986, although they do. Listed vacuum cleaners on the package are: EL4100, EL6985, EL6988, EL6989, EL7000, EL7020, EL7025 series.The reason I am giving the bag 2 stars, is because what they are made of and because I got something else than what I thought I was ordering. The bags also don't look as nice as the CLINIC bags do. These bags that I got look cheap."
2,Duped by a picture,"I placed my order for this product based on the picture of the vacuum cleaner bag and my empty box showing the same picture. What arrived was a generic bag that fits my vacuum cleaner. No wonder it was the cheapest site to buy these ""Electrolux"" bags!!!!"
1,These bags do not work!,"I just got off the phone with Electrolux after trying two of the four bags in my Electrolux vacuum cleaner that I have used for four years without any issue. These bags are not genuine and do not work. The suction is greatly diminished, practically non-existent. My cleaner works just fine with real Electrolux bags! So be careful - don't waste your time on these cheap knock-offs. I hope Amazon will refund my money."
4,Quick shipping,Only reviewing to say that the shipping cost was reasonable and I received the product in about 4 days!
4,S-Bag Clinic overkill,"I purchased the S-Bags from Amazon. The entire purchase process was efficient and precise. These S-Bags, however, are pretty darn expensive for something to fill with trash and throw in the trash. I only bought them because that is the bag that came with my Electrolux. I love the vacuum cleaner (really is excellent on hard floors!). I really don't have any significant allergy problems to warrent such a CLINICAL bag...I doubt any real clinic would use these because of the price. That said, the bags themselves are of high quality and seem as though they do what they are intended to do (keeps allergens at bay)."
4,Works as advertised,Use this on our canister vacuum. Works great. Looks like it's the retail package for 4 bags. Great value. Easy to switch out in the vacuum. Will buy again when needed.
5,Vacuum bags,These are a required product for my vacuum. In order to prolong the life of my vacuum I use the genuine products.
2,more comfortable than most...poor sound quality,"despite the 30mm drivers spec'd in the description, the sound is pretty flat. they are loud...i'll give them that. which will benefit you if you're driving them through a portable player. but there are better sounding (and looking) headphones out there for the same price or slightly more.they received the second star because for an inexpensive headphone, they are pretty comfortable and feel secure on my head.if you want a pair of small headphones that you won't be too upset if you lose them at the mountain, these will probably do. but if you're listening to music for any length of time, invest in some better headphones from sennheiser or audio-technica."
2,not worth the money,"These are fine if you are listening to audio books but not that great for music--bass is non-existant and they feel uncomfortable on your head. Also,they do not come with an in-line volume control as stated on the web page."
5,Great,Great Headphones...Bought them at office max (I think they had a price error) for $3.50...Well Worth the money hehe... Great and Durable (For the price I payed for it) Would recommend to anyone for 3.50.
4,"Nicely done, but what age will appreciate it?","There's quite a pleasant interplay between the art, whichdepicts realistically the play of two small children, andthe text, written in the context of their imaginary play.Alas, I'm not quite sure it works; given the brevity of thetext, this would seem to be intended for 2-4 year olds, yetthis age group may not be able to grasp the tension betweentext and illustration, which is the whole point. Still,a very nice piece of work."
2,Not one of Diana Palmers' best efforts.,"When reading this book, I had a hard time trying not to throw it across the room in disgust. The hero has no heart, and the heroine no backbone or courage. Any sane woman would have walked out (even if they were madly in love) on that jerk. It seems that in a lot of Diana Palmers' the heroes are tough and unforgiving while the heroine is weak and injustly punished. It wasn't worth the trip to the store."
1,awful,"This book was Ms. Palmer's worst...and I have read many. In short, the hero was just plain nasty. Don't bother with this one if you are looking for a romance book."
3,Not the same color as pictured; had to make cage adjustments,"We were really looking forward to receiving this water bottle for our girl bunny. Unfortunately it wasn't pink, as pictured when we ordered, which for our family was a major selling feature. It instead, is white. Also, I was shocked that it didn't fit the standard size wire cage and we had to snip some of the wires so that the rabbit could drink from the bottle.I do love that you can refill it from the exterior of the cage and it attaches securely to the cage. We just received it today, but so far I haven't noticed any dripping when our bunny is not drinking from the bottle."
2,SLOW AND DULL,"I don't know what was worse: the boring pace or the bad grammar.It wasn't long enough to be a novel, but too long to be a novella. It would have made an okay short story, but the way it is was toooooo long and redundant. Not one surprise. No twists. No real-life drama.I'm sorry to say: It was a waste of my time."
5,I love Monday Knight!,Very compelling and a must-read for all those Monday Knight fans out there! It was one of the best written books I have read in a long time. Janet Elaine Smith is one of my favorite authors anyway and Monday Knight has got to be her best. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
4,Love the poetry - great for boys in forensics competitions,"These poems are not easy to recite - but they are about the perfect length for forensics competitions that need a poem recited between 4-7 minutes. They aren't only for boys - but in the competitions we've been in, there are very few male point-of-view poems. A great change from the usual stuff out there. The Ballad of Blasphemous Bill and the Ballad of Sam McGee are great - although the words don't flow so smooth in some parts. There are great renditions on [...] - just search the name of the poem and you'll find them."
3,Humvee Photo Vest,"More than enough pockets, including two hidden inside, to satisfy just about any situation.The fabric could be a little heavier; I'm afraid it may not hold up well under extreme conditions, though I will have to use it for a while in order to evaluate its durability. I can see the weight being an advantage in hot weather, though.The 'combat' part of the name could only refer to the style - it is too light-weight to be of military level quality, but it is constructed well enough to justify the decent price."
1,Fabrication sucks. Would not buy.,"I ordered this vest for my photo gear, because it keeps lenses and filters and accessories close at hand better than lugging a camera bag when you're on the move quickly. You would think it would be perfect, and it would be. Except that the one I received, (a ""Hummer"" brand with a dorky looking silhouette of a Hummvee sewn into it) was made from khaki nylon. And every seam in the vest is fraying, shedding profuse amounts of fine nylon cruft all over the place. Nylon thread that works its way into your lenses and camera body.Manufacture quality is totally unacceptable for photo work. Maybe it's great for weekend warriors who want to imagine they drive Hummers, but basically junk for anyone who cares for their gear."
2,Poor Quality,Very poor quality...had to send it back for a replacement...the replacement came back and was also poor quality.
2,Fuzzy,"Got two of these from a different vendor for my wife and me to use as photo vests. Lots of nice pockets, but the material frays at all the seams and fuzzes up. A major irritant for photo purposes. Also, one of the inside pocket zippers froze in the locked position after one day. Big problem as that pocket had our passports in it. Ended up splitting the zipper and expected to see that it was jammed with material/threads. It wasn't, it was just frozen in the closed position. No teeth seemed to be broken or misaligned. Overall I like the design with lots of pockets, but the material makes it unsuitable for photo use in my view. I'll write the zipper issue off as a weird failure, but the material fraying is a show stopper for me."
2,Humvee Vests,The seams on large pocket frayed after first time worn. The design is good but workmanship is not.
3,Design better than manufacture,"I've used this in the field for two shoots. The design is functional and excellent. The quality of manufacture is less so. The material in the pockets is rather light for holding heavier items like camcorder batteries. Worse, the quality of sewing in the seams is poor, with light thread and stitching and loose ends throughout, already starting to unravel after just six days in the field. I still like it and hope it lasts longer than I expect it to."
1,junk,"bought one of these vests from a different vendor on the net; I'm very disappointed, this piece of junk is worth about ten bucks at the most. Extremely thin, it will fall apart within very short time. Stay away from Humvee vests."
1,Do not waste your money...,Not a keeper. Do not be fooled by the cover; both sides of the dvd appear to be from the 1980's.
1,Doesn't live up to the hype.....,"Consumer Reports raved about Swiss Diamond skillets. I bought this skillet for my husband as a Christmas gift (and who really enjoys his daily all-egg-white omelet). Well, it just never worked well. The eggs would never fluff up like they did with the previous skillet. Also, they would stick always..... He tried really low heat, medium heat, pre-heating the skillet, not pre-heating the skillet. Nothing worked well. So, maybe it works well for others and for other uses. But, we now have an expensive kitchen paper weight. Stick with the cheaper skillets....."
2,Disappointed over time,"I bought this pan hoping it would last a good long time. Like other reviewers, I loved it at first. With MODERATE use, after about 2 years, the nonstick surface started to wear. The pan looks all scratched up. I'm going to try to contact the company, but after reading another reviewer's experience, I don't anticipate I'll have much luck. If I do, I will repost/revise this review."
2,stick pan,"I purchased my first 10 inch swiss diamond pan in May 2007. It is now Feb 2010. I am on my second pan. I would say that the non-stick properties last about 12 months or so. The first was replaced under the lifetime warranty after about a year. I will probably send this in for replacement as well, since it is incredibly difficult to clean now (I have to soak it overnight to get rid of all the carbon residue). As a previous reviewer said, it builds up a layer of carbon that is impossible to remove.I find that my calphalon pans are much cheaper, fare no worse and is easier to replace under warranty."
4,so far so good (owned for 2 wks),"First of all I'd like to say that I've only used it for 2 weeks so I'm not sure if it'll be all scratched up after 1 year as some of the reviewer said. So far we like it. We use it to make taco meat and warm up taco as well, it's been great."
2,Waste of money,"I had high hopes for this pan being that it cost a bit more than I would usually pay. It does not deliver. The interior of the pan has scratched and corroded and offers very little nonstick. Doesn't matter what I do, my eggs stick as well as everything else. Save your money. I get better results from my stainless steel skillet than I do from this. And it looks horrible. Today is the day I am throwing it in the trash."
5,"Best Non Stick, NON Teflon Pan","When my wife and I read about how bad Teflon may be, we threw out all of our old pans and decided on this one for our family.It's perfect, never scratches, never sticks. It is truely worth every penny!"
2,"Great pan to start, then...","I LOVED this pan when I first got it, and for a while. I've had it for over a year now. It cooked evenly and was wonderfully non-stick. In fact, it cooked as nicely as a well-seasoned cast iron. I tried to care for it as directed, but even so, the pan has lost most of it's non-stick qualities and is difficult to clean well.To make a long story short, I prefer my old cast iron, and while they require some care, they hold their quality. This pan has become unmanageable as far as its non-stick coating is concerned. There doesn't seem to be any way to ""restore"" it as you would a cast iron pan.I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS PAN, but after one year, I am very disappointed. Started out well, but quickly went the way of cheap non-stick pans."
2,"Great at first, but has a short lifespan","I've had this pan for about 8 months and loved it at first. Once i adjusted to using lower heat, it worked fantastically as a non-stick pan. Over time, though, it has become progressively less and less non-stick. I take meticulous care of all my pots, including this fry pan. I wash them thoroughly after each use and use only silicon and wooden utensils with my non-stick pans, including this one. That's why I've come to the conclusion that Swiss Diamond non-stick just isn't that good, especially for the price point. At the current rate, it will be useless as a non-stick by the time I've had it for a year."
3,Things aren't always what they seem,"I almost bought this pan based on the claims of durability, non-stick, and the lack of Teflon. Being health consious I am warry about using a Teflon pan which can crack and flake off into my food. This pan looks like a great alternative, but if you're considering this pan do your research. Googling for more information, I found that the surface of this pan is made from the same chemical as Teflon, PTFE. They can say it doesn't include ""Teflon"" because they don't pay DuPont to use that name for PTFE. Functionally it may or may not be a very good pan, I don't know. What I do know is thier advertising claims are deceptive. Please consider this information when purchasing."
2,The non- stick pan sticks.,"After three+ years of use, my 8"" pan began sticking due to carbon buildup. I never used high heat and washed the pan with a sponge and dish soap. I called the company and was advised to make a paste of baking soda, coat the pan, leave overnight, and then scrub well with a non-abrasive brush or scrubber, which I did, to no avail. Just in case, I repeated the procedure, again to no avail. So, now I coat the pan with PAM whenever I use it, which, of course, negates it's value. As much as I have liked the pan, I'll now go to a regular, far cheaper pan, and just toss it when it begins to stick. Fifty bucks is a lot of money for a product that fails."
1,Stay Away!,"This pan scratches ans sticks. And the manufacturer does not stand behind its goods. To top it off, I was told not to use olive oil on high heat. ""Really""? Buyer beware!"
4,Great Pans,"Swiss Diamond makes great pans. I received one as a gift a few years ago and have since purchased 4 more for our use. I've never had a frying pan that was so useful, sturdy and easy to clean."
5,Swiss Diamond is a gem!,"After 24 years of buying and putting up with inexpensive (ie: cheap), and short-lived (the non-stick coating deteriorates noticably after about three weeks of regular use), non-stick cookware, we finally found Swiss Diamond: heavy duty construction, tough, non-stick finish, even cooking, and , of course, so easy to clean. We bought the 11-inch fry pan, fell in love with it, and bought a second one. Swiss Diamond is definitely worth the money!"
4,"Swiss Diamond 12.5"" frying pan",Saw this frying pan in a cooking class and it is everything they said it would be. Perfect size too.
1,impossible to clean,"I am so disappointed with this pan! I bought one and soon, even after careful washing, it was coated.Foolishly I bought another thinking I had done something wrong with washing, utensils or something.The second pan is the same impossible to clean nightmare!I won't be buying another..."
1,Don't buy Swiss diamond pans,"We bought this pan just about 1 year ago. We were told that we have a lifetime warranty on it. However, the food started sticking to it after a couple of months. We contacted Mrs. Sylvia Walker at the company. We are still waiting for her to answer our emails. The bottom line is that the product is defective, not worth the money and the customer service is horrible."
1,Surface is neither safe nor indestructable,"Avoid this pan; check out the consumer alert at NaturalNews.com for the truth about this Swiss Diamond pan. The surface is easily scratched, and contains toxic teflon chemicals. There are better, safer stainless steel pans available for less money, too!"
1,These are Teflon coated (beware),"The manufacturer uses PTFE to coat these pans. That is the chemical name for Teflon! Teflon is a Dupont brand name for PTFE. If you don't buy your PTFE from Dupont, it's technically not ""Teflon"" but it is exactly the same chemical.So, if you don't to want breath the fumes emitted by Teflon (or PTFE, same thing) then don't get these pans. The U.S. EPA is currently studying the toxicity of PTFE (Teflon), but it has already been shown in the few existing studies to produce hazardous fumes.Swiss Diamond is engaging in deceptive advertising by withholding the fact that their pans are teflon (PTFE) like all other non-stick pans."
5,What I hoped For,"My Ironclad pans stuck, these pans cook well and clean up great! One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight."
2,um...,"My initial opinion was that the pan is a good, heavy pan. I followed all instructions to the letter, but the coating scratched very badly. It was replaced without any hassle. I like the pan, but even though I let no bones or metal touch it at all and hand wash and dry and put it away immediately and so that nothing touches the cooking surface--it is still scratching, just not as quickly. an additional problem--after about a year, the handle becomes impossibly loose and cannot be tightened, making the pan unusable. Too bad--a nice , heavy pan, but two poor design points :("
4,Great buy!,The pan is well made. Clean up is exceptionally easy. The key to keeping it in good shape is not to overheat it. I use it to scramble eggs over medium flame. I do not need oil or butter. A solid purchase.
2,"CZ's, not Diamonds!","Well, I made my highly anticipated purchase of a 12 inch Swiss Diamond skillet 19 months ago.....honeymoon went fine, very happy the first few, short months. Then reality crept in, along with sticking, burning, build up of gunk , and distasteful look of the entire pan-inside and out. I am an experienced cook, and know how to treat a pan well. Used it last night for the last frustrating time! Potato pancakes stuck and burned! Into the recycle bin it went, ""diamonds"" and all! Just ordered the Farberware that is recommended by the famous Cook's show-we will see....."
1,Just another Teflon pan,"I was happy when I found the Swiss Diamond non-stick, since they claimed to not contain Teflon, be virtually indestructible, and last much longer. I bought an entire set and was happy at first, but after a while I noticed that they degrade as quick as any other non-stick Teflon pan, get scratched, surface degrades, sensitive to overheating, etc. When I looked online I noticed that there are sites that analyzed the pans and confirmed my suspicions, e.g., [...]. I must say I feel a bit scammed."
5,My all time favorite Jazz Band,"Joe Sample is My Favorite Keyboard Player&He always set this Band into Motion.but every member of this band holds down the Groove. this Collection has a cast of All stars bringing there A Game. Randy Crawford on the timeless ""Street Life"" which is still one of the Coldest grooves ever.BB King,Bill Withers&Bobby Womack bring the Heat as well on this Collection.you always know that Crusaders sound&It is always soulful&in the Groove."
3,Book Could have been SOOOO Good.....,"This book seemed to cover all the topics I wanted to get me in to being able to doing some of the things that I wanted to do right away with 3-D photo montages and working in 3-D space with AE and Photoshop but the book skips far too many steps and assumes you can read minds and know the ""in-between"" steps to get from one set of instructions to the next. I would not recommend this book to any one who does not have a very good grasp of AE. If you know AE very well then this may be the book for you. As for me I guess I'll just have to go back to my Total Training DVD's but I was hoping to get up and running a little quicker."
3,Not for the complete beginner...,"I have to say that you MUST need a solid undertanding or at least the basics of After Effects before getting this book. Also, there are not many figures to ilustrate the projects in an easy way.Get the book if you have good knoledge of After Effects."
2,Not recommend for intermediate and advance level,I bought this book thinking it would have some interesting workshop and new tricks. Turned out there's nothing more than showing old techniques and basic stuff. However this book has pretty useful information for beginners.
1,Very 'not great',"I'm an Afx user and found this book painfully basic. I bought it because it was recomended for high-end users which I'm sorry to say is a lie. The 'keying tutorials' arent even tutorials; they're just examples of what you can do with 3'rd party Plugins. If I wanted a demonstration in how to download plugins I'd visit my local Crack site, thank you very much."
3,"Good DVD, but should be in widescreen format.","The content on this DVD is very good, but I can't understand why it isn't presented in widescreen format like their PPV releases, since RAW has been presented in widescreen since before 2009. If this contained footage pre-dating widescreen, I could understand. Aside from the fullscreen format, it's a good compilation worth buying."
4,WWW The Best of RAW 2009,"I ordered this DVD for my grandson son who is 10.You thought I gave him a millon dollars.He watches it often, just the smile on his face made it all worth while, it was a Birthday gift."
4,Should have been called the Year of Randy Orton!,I say that because he was prominently seen more times than any other wrestler throughout the 3 disc set!I do believe there were other great moments we could have seen that should have been on the disc set or at least additional discs should have been added!This is a sort of great way to reminisce about the year that was & hoping that the Best of Raw 2010 will be even better than 2009!Great purchase for all wrestling fans!
4,Great Marketing WWE,"It's about time this kind of set is released. But, WWE, please, release sets for previous years of RAW as well. I for one would defintly get all of them, just as I'll get this 1 next month."
1,Whats the point?,What i'm wondering about this raw 2009 season set is...is this just gonna be a collection of some of the best matches and segments on raw from 2009 or is it gonna have like a 60 to 120 minute documentary at the beginning of disc 1 then like highlights and matches cause if it has no documentary and if you watch wrestling like i do then you seen every raw episode from 2009 and there are no point in buying this set...so any info on this set before it gets officially released would be great
5,Little Princess at it's Best!,I have been looking for this version of A Little Princess on DVD for years and am so excited that it is finally available! This is one of my favorite of the three versions out there and I am pleased with the content on the DVD. I would definatley recommend it to others and do frequently.
5,finally! it's been way over due.,"i've been waiting for a long time to see this on dvd. got it in the mail last night and watched it this morning. some of the seens from the vhs version were cut out but not much and there are some seens that are not in the vhs version that are put in. so i guess you can say it balances out. it's still absolutely wonderful. i love it, love it, love it."
5,"wonderful film, true to the book",I thoroughly enjoyed this video. It remains very true to the book. I was becoming rather tired of films straying so far from burnetts story. The film kept me enthralled from beginning to end. I have watched it several times and shown it to all my friends and they agree that it is a magical story. A must see!
5,Please put on DVD!,"This is the definitive movie version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel A Little Princess. Amelia Shankley, along with the rest of the cast, do a fantastic job of portraying the riches to rags story of an orphan girl, who goes from every comfort in the world to living in a cold attic and working as a skivie. The whole story revolves around how people should be treated, in every walk of life, be you rich or poor, a lady should always act like a princess, with grace, courage and a large and charitable heart. Lovely music with a touch of sadness to it, beautiful costumes, and sets that look straight out of Victorian England (mud, noise, carriages and all) makes this a gem, a gem that should not be lost. Please set up a site for those of us who would like it on DVD, now that the video is no longer available. The WB version is so inaccurate, it isn't funny. This is the version to watch and own."
1,Price?!,"This has a 5-star review, so it must be good, but what's up with the $95 price tag? At that price, I have to leave this off the wish list for my 9-year-old!"
5,Entertaining and Inspiring,This is a great movie!! It teaches courage and good character traits. I think its a great and enjoyable movie. It has been a favorite since childhood. A masterpiece!
5,A treasure rediscovered,"I can't remember the circumstances under which I first saw this adaptation of ""A Little Princess,"" which was one of my favorite books when I was little. I just recently saw it in the DVD store, and recognized the shot of Amelia Shankley on the cover, and picked it up because I vaguely remembered that I LOVED it 20 years ago. I was curious if it was really as good as I remembered, and if it would hold up 20 years later. Well, the answers are a resounding yes, and yes. It's a well-acted, thoughtful and moving adaptation of a classic childrens' book that I, as an adult, enjoyed thoroughly. Can't recommend it highly enough."
5,Sophisticated and realistic approach to gardening,"This is an extraordinary book. Though aimed at those who are re-assessing and re-vitalizing older gardens, is an excellent book for novice gardeners. It would help people avoid the pitfalls of creating gardens out of only plants they adore rather than using their instincts and intelligence in creating dynamic, highly personal gardens. Ms. Thorpes' writing style is very engaging and she addresses ecological issues in a thought-provoking way. This is simply a superb book, and is far superior to many glossy picture gardening books which ""gloss"" over the surface of critical processes required to make healthy gardens. Gardening requires work, thoughtfulness and knowledge, as Ms. Thorpe knows. I would give this book and ""Dirt"" by Dianne Benson to every gardener I know."
2,"Interesting, but not for my zone 9 garden",and it's into cutsie stuff for people with a lot of time and money. Not my kind of gardening book.
3,The Hand of Ethelberta,I am a long time fan of Thomas Hardy's work and this did not disappoint - full of the atmosphere of the period and good characterisations.
4,"Truth or Science Fiction, Either Way, A Good Read","Whether the statements in the book are true, or just some great science fiction, the book is easy to read, and the story is very riveting."
2,DISSAPOINTMENT!! Some Playboy Standards!?,"I thought that I was going to get the ""Best of Am Videos"" just like on Playboy tv but I didn't. The dvd content is completely turned down and tame compared to the content of Playboy TV itself. The DVD was very softcore and the scenes were shortened. I hope that other playboy dvd's are not like this if so you get better action just watching the Playboy channel on TV, and of course you're going to have to pay a monthl fee. just greatly disapointed in playboy for this. I guess that's why I got it dirt cheap!!"
