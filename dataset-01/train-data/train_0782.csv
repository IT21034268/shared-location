5,Funkentelechy : Still Funkin',"This next to The Mothership connection is one of Parliament's best. The best funky ingredients on this are Flashlight, The Bop Gun, placebo syndrome, and Funkentelechy. Funk On!"
5,More Funk Magic,"Parliament's superlative follow up to The Mothership Connection.The finest blend of funk, rock & dance music, at a time when James Brown was going through a dry period and Sly had pimped himself out.Clinton, Collins, Worrell & Co. were truly unsung magicians, who deserved a lot more publicity then they received through their career. They are hardly known outside the US, UK and Australia. Yet they are probably the biggest influence on rap and hip-hop music."
5,Truly warm and wonderful film,"I taped this show on my DVR to watch while my husband was watching the Super Bowl. I started watching it early and I couldn't stop. This show was really touching, very entertaining and not over done. I would recommend this film to anyone that wants a ""feel good"" movie. We have family movie night every Saturday and I am going to have us watch this next weekend. LOVED IT!!"
4,love the movie,I saw this movie several years ago while flying acrossCanada and loved it. Tried to rent it but found it was not available. so now hurrah I can watch it anytime. The only disappointment is the special features listed on the cover are not on the DVD.So that`s why you see **** instead of *****
2,More description needed for instant videos,"I believe this is a pretty good movie and an excelent storyline, but yahoo instant video has ruined it for me by not describing it as a subtitled film, and what's more they do this every time. Wether it is a subtitled film or an anime or even an anime that is english dubbed instead of subtitles which is how I prefer it at times, Amazon fails Fails FAILS!!! If you are reading this amazon staff I hope you take the subtle subtitle hint and start letting us know what language, the film we are puchasing to view as an instant video, will be showm in. Will it be shown in its origionally filmed language? Will it be shown in english dubbed form, or perhaps in some language I have not even thought of!? I would realy Realy REALY like to know BEFORE I BUY!!! THANK YOU!"
1,Sorry,"Couldn't get into the storyline. Dark, light, and then flashlight? I bet it didn't cost much to make this film. Not my taste. Sorry."
3,"Why, oh why....","While I think that Daywatch is a good movie, I did not think it was as good or action packed as its predecessor. The pace was slower, and the ending was sort of.. meh. I liked the ending of the first much better, it was darker and rang more true.. Also... who was the moron that decided to take out the original subtitles? That was one of the best things in the original release, and now they're gone?!!! What a bunch of dopes those guys at Fox are. The subtitles of Nightwatch were the most original and creative I had ever seen, and while the theatricalk release of Daywatch had similair but not as inventive subtitles, it was still better than the boring bottom whites subtitles. Too bad Fox... you screwed up."
3,Not as good as the original,"But still pretty good. With special effects that have much more creativity than Hollywood, this movie shows what a budget should do. The story, however, is a little lacking. Much more obtuse than the last one, it definitely builds off of it, but doesn't really seem to do much with the ideas. It's visually entertaining, but is a little overlong and somewhat slow."
3,Overall pretty darned solid,"I was excited to see Russian cinema's take on a fantasy thriller. Overall I must say I was not disappointed at all. The film had lots of fun quirks that made it a delight to watch. The story line was solid, the acting was aok, and the cinematography was excellent."
1,DO NOT RENT THIS!!!,The movie is in Russian. The preview makes the movie look good but it is sooo misleading. The bulk of the movie is a very badly acted love story. I hope this review saves at least one person from wasting their money and time.
2,Don't Bother!!!,"Love the books - great concept with a huge potential - Movie fails. Night watch was a good movie, and I was really hoping that they would step it up and make Day Watch something memorable.Not worth the time or money."
1,terrible,"If this film could get zero stars, it would. Absolutely terrible. Maybe it would have been better if I saw the ""Night Watch"" because there's absolutely no background. I love B films and couldn't stand this one. Save your money."
2,A Tremendous Letdown,"I understand that Daywatch is a low budget film, but i think that somewhere in the budget they could have set aside some money to buy a couple of tripods. Practically the entire movie is filmed free hand, and not a steady freehand. This effect is usually uses as a tool to convey haphazard action, and thats fine. When used sparingly. I literally got a headache from watching this movie. Much of the care that seemed to go into the far superior Nightwatch is missing in this trainwreck. I honestly had no idea what was happening through at least 70 percent of this film. The production just didn't have the sleekness of the predecessor. It felt like a rough draft. I hop that these guys can do a better job with Twilight Watch, although I dont really understand where the story can go from the ending of this movie."
1,Disappointed...........................,"Very Disappointed............This Movie Licks the Sweat off a Dead Mans Balls........................I hate when the Movie Trailer is Better than the actual Movie.Basically, this is another one of those movies where the very best parts of the movie, about 2 minutes, is in the Trailer.The Story itself, plot, is a great Leader but the Movie sequence and story telling SUKZ!I give Big Props and Kudos to the Special Effects Guys who did a Great Job with the action sequences BUT The Director and Story Board Guy Needs to be Spanked with Bamboo sticks.Nice try...but No Cigar.............."
2,Incoherent Mess,"The previews for this movie looked so cool... but this was a completely incoherent mess of a movie. I watched the first movie on Netflix first, and that was also a mess that made no sense. Way too many characters doing things that make no sense. I never got any real feeling people were magical, would have been cooler if you could see the powers more and how they relate to people. The story just doenst make any sense. Maybe if I was Russian I would get it, kind of like how you gotta be British to get most british humor."
4,Enjoyable,Not quite the charm of the first movie though....I am going to go back for a second viewing but what they improved on in terms or special effects...they lost in terms of the story and hokeiness added in....Like the difference between empire strikes back and return of the jedi.....it's like muppets were brought in
1,No animated subtitles on bluray,How can a studio release this film on hi-def and not include the coolest effect of the entire film - the animated subs? Anyone buying this is just encouraging studios to put out overpriced substandard releases - don't put up with it.And even more bizarrely - their release of Night Watch doesn't have them either.
5,"A dark, twisty, hilarious movie","I like foreign films. I know that automatically puts you in mind to not finish reading this review, but if you make it this far, I would say that Day Watch is a fun little romp of a Russian movie; just as dark and sarcastic and cold as a Russian winter. The actors are entertaining, the plot is edge-of-your-seat, and the ending is worth the wait. Just TRY IT. I promise you'll like it."
2,You saw the best part in the previews!,"If you saw the previews for this flic, you saw the only thing worth watching. Made in one of the iron curtain countries, characters wander around looking for those from the Other Side. Weak story line...questionable script and boring. Apparently they created the CGI special effects shots and then tried to work a story line around them...very poor submission."
2,huh?,Well it had an interesting start and I expected much from it. It started but it never jumped out except the trailer and it wasnt what i hope for.
4,Good Old School SciFi,"Daywatch is totally original yet completely familiar. Good vs evil, special powers, alternate dimensions, it has it all. Definitely recomend it to fans of old school scifi like the Thing or Aliens."
3,DayWatch Unrated DVD,"This DVD, in my opinion is just as awesome as the first (NightWatch). True, it is confusing as can be, but the action and suspense along with fantastic graphics makes this a must see DVD."
2,Is Day Watch Worth Watching?,"Day Watch is the continuation of the threads Night Watch laid down. It's also a trying movie that wears out its welcome about an hour and a half in. (It's 146 minutes long.) It also falls apart at its cop-out ending, which I saw before the prologue ended.Day Watch tries to succeed, it really does, but it's not that the movie is too ambitious. The main fault with the movie is that the concepts introduced in Night Watch only make for one movie. Any further movies and the concept is exposed as being, for lack of a better word, stupid. Nothing is really explained. Every character thinks they're smarter than each other only to be proven wrong time and again. The whole experience insulted my intelligence and tried my patience.And have I mentioned that lame ending?Avoid this movie and its prequel Night Watch."
2,Russian Magic Fiction,"I bought this movie because he had just bought an HD LCD TV (and got a free bluray player from Amazon). I was looking for some sci-fi/zombie/killer robot movies and stumbled across this.It is, apparently, a translation of a russian novel (actually, it's a series, but you know what I'm saying). The backstory and plotlines are WONDERFUL! I can see that this setting has a fantastic potential.Unfortunately, I don't think it was pulled off. I don't mind dubbing. I'd rather have dubbed than subtitled. The special effects were rather cheesey and a number of the characters were strictly two-dimensional (and some even almost one dimensional). I inferred a lot of the plot and had to explain it to the spouse as things progressed.I want to like this movie. I REALLY want to like it, but I just can't.I gave it two stars because of the potential of the setting. I'll probably trade this one off or put it up on eBay."
3,Fun - Day Watch,"Very free fantasy, continuation of the adventures of Light and Dark bands of super-human Russian (or something like it) trying to salvage their relationship. Everything is inconsequential but also extreme. It represents well the Russian character, or at least its stereotype: it looks like a hard night drinking, a lot of lights and nothing really happening. But in its own terms is better than the feeble attempts of the American industry to impress us with CGI that is done cheaper in Eastern Europe. The director of this film would do an incredible second unit helmet in greener lands. Is this cinema? Well, is more cinema than some script-based attempts at drama which I saw lately (""Transamerica"", for example). At least the man here thought about something called frame."
1,DO NOT RENT,"The movie trailer makes the movie look fantastic. The trailer is in English. However, you have to READ the entire movie! It is in a foreign language. No indication of this on the description or on the movie preview. I wish I could get my money back. I fast forward to different points in the movie hoping that somewhere they would start speaking english. NO SUCH LUCK. I turned it off without ""reading"" the rest of the movie. I ""watch"" movies to ""see"" and not to read. I ""read"" books. This purchase was a total waste. Sure wish I could get my money returned for this falsely advertised item. Now I think I'll go get a book to ""watch""."
2,I agree,I agree with the previous review from ohio. It could have been sooooo much better. Read the books kids.
1,Sloppy work,"What a mess! Amazon should be ashamed for putting this out without warning that the entire film is a sloppy foreign work which looks like it was filmed with a hand-held video camera. The entire mess is subtitled, but the pace of the film is so fast, and the film so shaky, that you can't read the subtitles. I am aware that the ""buyer should beware,"" but Amazon should give enough information to make an intelligent decision when we are shopping from the comfort of our homes. I watched 15 minutes of this disaster, and for the first time in my life, I want a refund."
1,"SUCKED, BIG TIME","This movie dserves 0 stars. I am a huge fan of vampire films and will watch any vampire movie in its entirety. I couldn't do it with this movie or Day Watch the second installment. I dont know what the other reviewers were on when they viewed these films, but I didn't have any mind altering substances. I can't see how anyone can compare these movies to the Matrix or any other above average american made sci-fi film. They must be Russian born or something and giving the glowing reviews out of loyalty. Irregardless of where you're from these movies suck bit time!!"
3,Worth renting,"This movie is weirder than the 1st. The 1st movie is much better, if it was available for rent where i live or through netflix i would have rented it. Worth watching but maybe not owning."
4,Foreign flick with sci-fi twist,"You may have seen the previews and noticed the fantastic special effects in this foreign film which is what draws you in. It reminds a little of Blade Runner in that the films seeks to break boundaries about what is known about science fiction. It may be a little hard to follow the story, but the pace accelerates to keep you interested. If you watched other foreign films and don't mind following the subtitles, then you will enjoy this movie."
3,Different,"It is interesting to watch a foreign movie, the cg were great, the story line did not develop fully. You did not develop a sympathy for the hero of the movie, since you did not realize who the hero is until almost the last third of the movie."
3,It was okay,"After watching Wanted I looked up the director to decided to watch this movies and Nightwatch. Which they had interesting story lines the movies themselves were very slow paced with some very good action scene thrown in here and there. The story line got a little confusing here and there but I never read the book which probably could have helped. I would say over all, no harm, no foul."
4,great movie,"awesome blend of action, fantasy, and horror to create on of the most awesome movies (i consider this and Night Watch one movie. think kill bill parts 1+2.) i dont see where people get the sci fi from, but whatever. also, its not really about vampires, despite what you may hear. yes, it has horror elements, but its mainly action/dark fantasy badassery."
2,No animated subtitles!,"Please note that I am rating the disk alone and not the film which I give 4 stars. Why Fox decided to release this great Russian epic without the original animated subtitles is beyond me! It really does take a lot out of the movie and unless Fox realizes that both Night Watch and Day Watch suffer for this and re-releases them with the original subtitles, I will refuse to buy!"
3,Poor quality translation to Kindle of a classic book.,"This is a great book - a WW II classic. But the Kindle edition is full of missing, misplaced and misspelled words and typos - making it a bit more difficult to read. I'm enjoying the read, but disappointed by the sloppy translation."
4,What a Story,"I reread this book after about 45 years, Some of Col Scott's stories of his youth seemed too fantastic to believe. The P-40 is still my favorite WWII airplane, maybe thanks to this book. I can see now having read some about WWII that this book coming out in 1943 was a great encouragement to our country's morale. As an airplane mechanic and former pilot I would recommend this book. Col Scott has a reverence for God which I appreciate."
4,"Excellent book, fair translation.","I had been wanting to read this book for a lot of years, when a friend jogged my memory.With my new Kindle Touch, it was only a Whispernet away, so I got it.It was better than I had anticipated, as I had thought it may be a bit preachy, but it was just a well writtenaccount about some early years WW2 pilots helping the Chinese whilst under manned and under-gunned.The word bravery is just not enough to describe these gallant men's actions. The combat described was intense.The only reason I held back a star was the translation from print to the Kindle addition was a bit lacking. A good97% was accurate, but some areas were muddled. The word ""time"" does not appear correctly even once, each time it isspelled out as ""tune."" I got used to it."
1,FORGET IT ....,"This book is bad, man ... I've read dozens of WW II fighter aviation combat books. One thing I learned for sure: the ones written during the War are the worse. This is not an exception. Scott has a lousy writing style, and almost made me puke with his absurd patriotic messages and hatred for the Japanese. I'm not a rreligious person, but I think it's funny and outrageous (at the same time !!) to read the delight that Scott has when killing and strafing Japanese foot soldiers and say that God is helping him in doing so !!!!! Incredible hipocrisy !! Bad book !"
4,God Is My Co-Pilot,"This book is great reading. It tells the personal account of a man who above all things wishes to fly. He takes his flying skills to their limit to help defend Freedom. The book shows the feelings and events that took place during a terrible time in history. To further prove how enjoyable this book was, I am the type of individual who would rather watch a move than read a book. There are few books that can capture my attention long enough for me to finish it and this was one of them."
5,Face to face with a personal decision to fight,"I read this book in its first edition 45 years ago when I was in grade school and the movies were full of the glamour of war. Scott sidesteps the glamour and the heroics and presents a personal view of daily decisions and commitment. There are young men today who would do well to take a look at what went into Scott's personal values and why the author decided he had a helping hand in the cockpit. There is far more reality and humility than, for example, Charles Lindberg's ""Spirit of St. Louis"". I also recommend Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Wind, Sand and Stars."
5,"A great, true story of a courageous man that should be read","Col. Scott was a true hero, who attracted the attention of the world after he had served in Gen. Chenault's American Volunteer Group before Pearl Harbor, then afterwards in the Army Air Corps. He tells the story from real first-hand experience. He has the ability to keep the reader focused on each word, and each experience. That is mixed in with his Faith in God for watchcare during such military action. I was privaledged to serve under Col Scott during WW2...and he is still my hero. Bill (Billy) H. Jobe"
2,Not for the Beginner,"This book shows beautiful faux finishes, but goes more into the natural and/or elaborate elements needed to attain the beautiful finish. It doesn't teach the beginner or home decorator the basic steps needed to attain the wonderful results. I am no closer to a beautiful faux finish in my livingroom than I was before purchasing this book."
2,ughhh frustrated,"I went to SideCho's site to get Some by Sea's album (which is actually really good.) Since they were having a great sale I decided to check out a few other groups, and got this CD based on all the good reviews here. This was definitely not what I was expecting...I mean maybe it can be classified as ""indie"" but it reminds me of radio pop punk in a bad way -- I think because of the electric guitar sound on a lot of the upbeat songs, the cheesy cliched lyrics, and the lead singer's voice. Something about that voice grates on my nerves to no end! Overall sounds like, hmm, Motion City Soundtrack maybe? I don't know a whole lot about this genre so it's hard for me to come up with a good comparison.The album's not terrible, though. The instrumentation sounds decent, there's just nothing to differentiate most of the songs to me. No spark. For similar indie pop/rock done well, check out Spoon, Ted Leo, maybe the Hold Steady ""Boys and Girls in America"" or Pavement ""Crooked Rain Crooked Rain."""
4,Sherwood - a band on the rise,"Sherwood is way talented and deffinatly a band on the rise! This is a must have cd. Check out www.purevolume.com/sherwood for more songs or check out their website www.sherwoodmusic.net The song ""The Summer Sends Its Love"" (not on this cd) was also on the show Radio Free Roscoe. If you like this CD you might also want to check out The Pettit Project (pronounced ped-it).Keep on singing, Sherwood!BTW their going on tour.... check out dates on their website"
1,Disappointed,"Try as I might I could not get the software for disc 1 to work on my otherwise healthy, happy and virus free computer. I tried exchanging the disc and using different computers, but no luck."
1,leaking and false advertising,"It arrived leaking, and despite the fact that the page says it is 6 X 8 oz, there was just 1 jar! for over $13!!!! Buy elsewhere. I love this product."
1,ouch,"neal's jumped on the catholic-bashing bandwagon. vitriolic. i've been an avid fan for the last three cd's. however, i love my church for many reasons, and this cd is offensive."
1,"Garbage: Un-emotional Lyrics, A Waste of Talent and Musicianship","I apologize to all the Neal Morse fans but even as a Christian I am not impressed. I Do not believe him. Not at all. Not a word. It's like every word he sings is forced and constructed, it does not flow from the heart and soul. He sacrifices great music by ruining it with lyrics that serve only to get his religious rhetoric accross. The instrumentalism is amazing but the lyrics ruin this album. As a progressive rock album this would have some great potential if you take out the lyrics. I respect Neal's faith because it is his life and his business, but as an artist and his music on this CD he gets a major thumbs down."
5,A progressive masterpiece for the ages,"I haven't been rocked this hard by an album since Dream Theater's Scenes From A Memory. Messages about faith, etc aside...this isn't a sermon. It's a progressive rock album. And a DAMN fine one at that. Neal is the very definition of a true musician, equally at home on guitar, piano, vocals, and more. The guitar work on this album would be impressive even for someone who is purely a guitarist. The musicianship is outrageous but at no point does it overwhelm. The harmonies are amazing and the vocal lines are all memorable. I am infinitely thankful to Mike Portnoy for getting the band Flying Colors together (another amazing outfit Neal's in), because it caused me to check out Morse's solo stuff and his work with Spock's Beard. Every now and then a band comes along and recharges my batteries as both a musician and a music-lover, and this album did it in spades. Give it a listen, any fan of progressive music will love it."
5,For a Reason...,"Face it. We live in trying times. History is beginning to repeat itself as we steadfastly ignore the growing evil in the Middle East-sorry to be so un-PC, but it's true. Do you realize that Bible prophecy is coming true with the Iran-Russia connection? Before you label me crazy, this comes from world leaders, not just folks branded by the secular horde as ""end-days fanatics"". My point, thank God for Neal. He is here, I feel, for a reason... I hope and pray that Jesus' return is not imminent so that more of us have time to receive him... This is Neal's message. Since Testimony... If indeed we are living in the (now unfortunately cliche end-times), it is nice to have such a talented and wise performer who may, through the power of his music and faith, bring more folks into the fold. Just in case... Thanks for another great one Neal!"
4,4 1/2 stars for this prog gem,"Neal Morse has become one of my favorite prog musicians. His talent is astounding, mind-boggling actually, and his songwriting prowess is equally impressive. It was with great anticipation that I received Sola Scriptura after the perfection of ?, a modern-day prog masterpiece.Sola Scirptura falls short of the brilliance of ?, but only slightly. The first two tracks, despite being outwardly opinionated and even pompous in their lyrical content, shine in their instrumentalism and melodies. Impressively structured and heavy in content. Quite a shining acheivement! The ballad falls short of Neal's earlier efforts on Testimony and One, and the final track is a rehashing of material from Snow in the first part, and the revisiting of themes from the first two tracks, not as well done as it was on ? (12 and Entrance).Still--welll worth getting for the first two tracks alone, over 50 minutes of music."
4,Sola Scriptura,"This is an incredible album. As a Christian who loves and plays music, I appreciate the musicianship of this album and the way that Neal Morse has incorporated his faith into the message.This album is a bit heavier musically than his previous albums - but if you like Transatlantic, Spock's Beard, or other Prog Rock music, you should have this CD in your collection."
4,Great game with some pitfalls,"I love Madden, I wait for it every year and it usually lives up to its name. This year's version, although I only played 12 games thus far, is no exception. Instead of saying the same things some of the other guys have, I just like to focus on the few things that I think need improvement:1) AI pass defense. As a Rams fan, this is usually the only team that I play with. However, I also know that our pass defense is not the greatest. But somehow, in my first 12 games, all my DBs have at least 4 picks, some at 8! Thats is CRAZY! However, T. Holt is able to make 5 catches for 250 yards every game!!2) Running game. It is impossible to run consistently. Marshall Faulk is rated 94 and I am averaging 3.5 YPC.3) Challengs. Every time the CPU challenges a call, it gets reversed.All in all its a great game, with some new twists, but these small problems need to be addressed on the next version."
4,The Best,"First of all this kills ESPN and all the others . This is a great game but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the franchise mode. Its terrible . Unless you like to have owner mode . Id would be great without owner mode . But the graphics are awesome and everythang else! The Live play is awesome, log in, and boom you have a match, compared to espn where it takes 30minutes . great game!"
2,The Same Game,I was expecting more changes in this years version of Madden 2005 from the last years version of madden 2004. If you have Madden 2004 there is no need to buy 2005. They really didn't make that many changes to the game. I think ESPN2k5 is off the chain and it blows Madden 2005 out of the water.
1,Buy ESPN NFL 2K5.,"This game is simply dreadful. Reading from past reviews I am thankful I am not the only one who beleives this. AI is horrible! The computer side can come out of a 24-0 shutout with 3:00 minutes left in the fouth quarter. I mean, come on, it is impossible! The same game is great for the Nintendo DS, but not for the consoles at all. Try and buy ESPN NFL 2K5!!"
3,espn is a better game,this game is good but espn is much better save your money and go buy a better game for a better price. look out for espn july 20th.
1,Maddens Time Expired This Year,"I Know there will be some die-hard madden fans that will still buy this, but i think anyone with half a brain will be buying ESPN 2k5...better graphics, and they wanted it more (heh).....unless maddens price drops that is"
3,It Could Be So Much Better....,"I purchased this game with great expectations, but was extremely disappointed. I have only had the game a week, and it irritates me the amount of things wrong with this game. There are some positives though, such as the minicamps, create-a..., and good graphics. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh them. I play with the Philadelphia Eagles, and on one play Simoneau intercepted a pass. Following the INT., the broadcaster said ""Simoneau just couldn't find anyone, and gave it away"". Also, when a receiver for the opposing team breaks lose, I'll get very close to him in a sprint, then for NO REASON turn around and run backwards!!! I would be down by 4 points and the broadcaster will say ""The Eagles! are down by a touchdown."". For $50, everyone should get their money's worth, but it seems as though this should be found in the $5 bin at EBGames. Very disappointed, and plan to NOT purchase anymore Madden titles."
2,Could Have Been Better!!!!,"I played Madden 2005 for about an hour and felt like I was playing Madden 2004. The only changes made to the game were the new owner modes, minigames, play moral, etc. Game play was bad. When players are running around after the play, they look like ballerinas. All the players move together. Graphics could have been a lot better. Players backs are too big, and hand movements are just plain bad. Players features are just way to boxy. Rent the game and save your money.....Another guy who fell for the hype."
4,HOT,THIS GAME IS THE BEST FOOTBALL GAME YOU CAN GET. WHEN YOU FIND A BETTER FOOTBALL GAME BESIDES MADDEN 2006 YOU TELL ME.

1,madden 2005,This is the last time I buy Madden for the Xbox. Every year the programmers make numerous errors. Last year Eric Johnson of the Raiders had the picture of the Johnson on the 49ers. This year several of the Raiders have the wrong position and you are unable to change the players position even in francise mode. Since when has Tyler Brayton played linebacker even in the Raiders new 3-4 defense he still plays defensive end. Adam Treu does not play guard but at least you can change his position to center. Also Doug Gabriel who was on the 2004 game is suddenly absent. Chris Hetherington and Brad Badger are missing. I wonder why most of the players position are locked in. This is a mistake especially if the player has the wrong position. Also previous Madden games always freeze up when your playing and I have had my punter come out and punt on first down at the other teams goal line this can be very annoying.
2,Worst Madden ever,I have purchased and enjoyed every Madden title until this one. Do not believe the hype that is behind it. Either stick with 2004 or get NFL 2K5.I would suggest renting the game before even considering buying. I am glad I kept my receipt.
5,madden nfl 05,this game is sweet i love it i have a girl friend and she loves it am 13 and foot ball rocks e-mail me at (...)
3,"Some pluses, some mininus, but a better image than consumer ATSC TV's.","Pros:1. Cost (compared to Tote Vision & Marshall Electronics)2. Sturdy stand3. Improved connector (but see below)4. PC input (don't know why/how you could really use it)5. Less backlight leakage over the older 8096. Better menu over the 8097. Though 2x the price, a better image than a Haier 10"" consumer TV (w/ tuner).Cons:1. Older 809 model had a better picture; sharper and brighter (brighter backlight)2. Connector dongle very fragile. Better if inputs are on the set itself3. Color level needs to be almost at the max position.4. Easy to overdrive the screen and clip whites. Limits how bright the image can be. (not so with the 809)."
2,no replacement offered for damaged item,"Amazon would not replace this item through target after they sent it to me damaged. By re-ordering, I had to pay shipping & handling that should have been free. Amazon was, however, prompt in refunding money (Although shipping & handling didn't apply in the first instance)."
2,Plastic? It's not metal,Rods and finials look okay from a distance but up close you realize the finials are plastic and don't even match the rod. Assumed they were brushed nickel so was quite disappointed. But I guess you get what you pay for.
3,We are the world,"While the title song was worth the $90.00 tge rest of the disc was of really no value..It a shame that those of us who were out serving our country naver had a chance to but this when it was priced right. While I can approve of his actions , he was a great and gifted person and I do think he will be missed and his music and dance will live on as did the Beatles.Col. P D (duke) retired"
4,So many artists - such great sound!,This CD is getting very difficult to find...it should be in everyone's music collection. MP3's just cannot compare to the equisite full sound on this CD. Your ears and soul will thank you for getting this one.
4,Another Mozart's book from the Landon's quill,It's not so vivid and fruitful as Mozart's Golden years or 1791 but if you love Mozart and want to become a connoiseur you should read it!
3,Great if you are still an undergraduate!,"This book is really insightful to those who are still earning their undergrad degrees. It offers many tips on resume writing, networking, and assessing ones own skills. If I were a junior in college this would have been a great source of information and inspiration. However, for someone who has been out of school for a short period of time, it doesn't offer much in the way of career guidance. It does offer good tips on graduate school and how to find the program that is right for you depending on what type of job you are interested in after. It also lists all the professional associations for a political scientist."
2,Tell Me Something I Didn't Know,"This book may be somethat interesting for polisci majors when they are first starting out, but once a person has their degree and their resume, it is not worth the time to read it."
5,Life is Full of injustice,"Back in the eighties the critics loved them, fellow musicians raved about them, they were called the Rush of thrash and they blew away bands like Slayer and Metallica. It never helped them achieve the following they deserved. If they do have any form of a cult following it would be based around Tommy T Baron's sensational guitar work which by the way reaches it's apex on this album. It's progressive it's technical but it's catchy it has songs that generally clock in around 4 minutes. Coroner is exemplified by the song D.O.A absolutely stunning stuff. Music lovers know a metal band has never been as underated as Coroner."
5,BEST EVER,This is the best football game out in stores now and maybe ever! This game has awsome gameplay and great new features such as the hit stick (which is very risky I might ad) and play maker control. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!
5,madden 05,"Madden 20005 is a great game game. The franchise mode is awesome same with the trading and stuff. Hit sick is great, and you can make a fantasy team, the best football game yet by far."
5,awsome dudes,This game is awesome!1 thing i like is storyline central.& create-a-fan.franchise mode is pretty awesome.here's some pros&cons;proscool fran.modecool gameplayconssometimes madden gets on nerves
4,great graphics,"Thiis game is great when you first get it, when i first got it i was hooked. The graphics are great, but the gameplay however is average. The rookie mode is extremly easy and i switched to pro right away. on pro passing is farely realistic but running is nearly impossible. No matter if your L:adanian Tomlinson or some undrafted rookie from a division 3 college it seems almost every run results in a huge loss. Something I really liked was the franchise mode. The best part is the newspaper section and the radio mode. One flaw is when ever some one on your team getss the ball and is tackled you get absolutly nailed, resulting in many injuries.Ihope this review was helpful to you because it's my first."
5,One Word - Amazing,"I played this game at my friend's house all afternoon. This game is amazing because the graphics have improved, the players look more realistic and the controls are perfect. With the concentration on defense, the Madden Franchise has made it fun to play defense because you have the option to do many things such as audible coverage, blitz everyone, place a QB spy (very helpful against Mick Vick), and many more options all after you call the play. The hit stick is a good feature and if used at the right time, the opponent usually fumbles the ball. All in all, the game is worth it and the Madden Franchise has done it again."
1,waste of money,this game stinks. it is a football sim but somehow manages to take the fun out of the game. do not waste your money on this. i would recommend nfl 2k5 instead for a lot less money and a lot more fun. madden 2005 has been micro-managed to the point that the game simply is not fun to play. i mean does it really matter to most players how much a hot dog costs at a game? how should that really determine how your team plays. i wasted money on a madden game and i later sold it because i realized that the franchis was over hyped. please don't waste your money on madden 2005.
4,y,y is it that u wait all year for a game 2 come out and 2weeks before its suoposed 2 be relased they push the game back 4 days. y? y? y? yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy??????????? just give me my game now......................................................
2,A sad day for Madden.,Look i am a die hard Madden Lover. I have been playing this game for a long time I mean years. Madden has come a long way but ESPN is better. I had to see it to believe it. The graphics are so much better. The detailed motion of the QB throwing the ball. The game has Sports Center on it. Madden has not changed that much except the Feild Goals and the hit stick which you have to time just right to be effective. I just dont think Espn is better beacuse of the price cause I have been so faithful to madden for so long that the game could have been 80 dollars and I would have still got it. Espn just won this year but madden will be back. So if you are a die hard madden fan get it but for fun and true football fans get the ESPN
1,good but not great,not the game people say it is. long live lexington steele!! his perch puts others to shame.
5,Madden is better then ESPN!!!!!!!!!!!,1st of all ESPN sucks the first day i had it i returned it. the game play is crapy unlike madden is 5 times better. In ESPN can u do Hit stick let me guess no u cant. 2005 is better then 04 because the new hitstick. ESPN can not compete agenst madden it would be to imparist to make 2K6by its bably beating by madden. it is better then 04 by the better grapfics are better and they made the players look more built. And i hate how people say ESPN has beeter graphics then madden. why would ESPN sell a game 4 $19.99 when its not even werth it. And why would people say its more werth it it is cheep and so is ESPN. The resson why more people bouht ESPN more because maybe they cant aford a $49.99 game .My all time game is Madden and ESPN is nothing compaired to madden. Put it this way ESPN sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!! so there ya go madden is the best period. ESPN it not werth playing it play madden then after that you would not want to play it any moe or you might just sell it .
5,"game...great, Toys r us horrible!!!!!!","i preordered this game from toys r us and i didnt even get to the stock room 7 days after it hit circuit city, eb games, bestbuy or even targetthe game is great but the toys r us service sucks!"
1,terrible,when we got the game it was severly scrachted and has never been played!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a waste of 20.00!
3,Madden is Still Madden but over priced,"Like many people out there I have enjoyed Madden for many years, and this year is no different. I had the chance this weekend to Play Madden (Yes it is Prior to Release but Hey some time lifes have it perks) and as always I was impressed with the game, however I think it has made little improvement over last years offering. The real issue here is if you are a hard core Madden fan this game is for you. It is Madden. However this years ESPn is really great and I can say that if you just want a football title on PS2 or XBOX then ESPN is just as good a game and the difficulty is pretty equal, each game has flaws and ways to make the level seem easy. Learing to play a ballanced game is the key. Overall I say ESPN is a better value due to it's 19.99 price Tag, I love madden but cannot say it is worht three times the Price."
3,confusing...,"this is not real football! in napoli, football we play with foot, not throwing oval ball. when i play madden 2005, i get very mad because not real football. but i try to play game anyway not sure of rules. why wearing helmet?? maybe people confuse about football! i learn how to throw american football from watching little man on tv...like real life or no? my friend know this type of football and he teach me how to play. he show me how to do three point kick play?!? now i dont understand why people playing with hand? game too slow, one time in napoli we play but very fast running all the time, not here. they stopping too much. i think nice pictures from game. maybe more fun when i learn rules. make me angry cannot score more than 3 point kick play. but is ok"
3,never showed up,"I am still waiting since Dec. 18th and it never showed up, I have e-mailed the last several days and no response from the seller. I better have not been charged for this. This was a christmas present from one son to the other. New Year and still no present for christmas. When will it arrive for 2007 christmas?"
2,Not even close...,"Hype. That's the name of the game with EA Sports. And yet, none of their current titles can compare to the ones released by ESPN and Sega. This is no exception. Oh sure, it's got great tunes from Franz Ferdinand and Green Day, but can't you hear those on the radio?OOOH...it has Tony Bruno. Yippee.Madden is an annoying old blowhard, and his comments are just as annoying as ever.And the graphics and gameplay are a JOKE.Avoid."
3,Madden NFL 2005,"Madden 2004 was the best football game in years much better than the previous installments. Problem is, I played it so much this years Madden better have some major changes in the engine and graphics. 2004 and 2003 were almost the same except 2004 had much improved gameplay with a good balance of passing and running. This year if it's not different, I'm not gonna bother with it, like I said I played 2004 too much already. Lets not forget this is a great year for games unlike last year. This year we got GTA: San Andreas and Halo 2 and others to put Madden into perspective. Even so, it's gonna sell well and it just tears at me that a game that releases an enstallment every single year and works around this kinda of formula sells so good every year. Other games have to work to be good. [...]"
2,this game is worse than 04,"Im 15 years old. I think that this is the worst football game sinse 2000. Not because of the graphics, their great, or because of all the new features either there also great, except one. John Madden thought that it would be a great idea to have no choice on if you want or don't want to have the salary cap turned off. Now usually I play for the first couple years with a salary cap, like i did this year, but I found out that after I played 2 years of my season I couldn't play because I was 30,000,000 dollars in the hole and I did not have any created players, and they were all average players. I play with the vikings. The only people on that roster that have big salaries are Moss and Culpepper. Why doesn't madden get rid of that AI. thing, that is the dumbest thing on the game. I sure hope Madden doesnt do that again next year or I wont be buying his game."
4,User Profile Issues,"I bought the Collectors Edition Madden 2005 and my buddies bought the regular Madden 2005. Well, I go to my buddies house to drop the whoopin on him and lo and behold? My memory card shows to files on it?After my befuddlement subsided, I found that THE USER PROFILES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE!The bottom line?If you own the collectors edition you cannot import your profile into regular Madden 2005 and vice-versa. That to me is a huge drawback, it is the same as game and the profiles ""should"" be compatible.I also worry that you will not be able to play online with other people unless you are playing the same ""edition"" which I also think is hooey.Other than that the game is great, much better than last year. The Defensive AI is good and the hit stick is really cool!"
4,Franchise Fun,"I have been a Madden Fan since the Sega Genesis days and after buying this year's release, I still am. The last Madden I played was 2003 but never touched 2004 b/c I heard there wasn't much of difference. I mainly bought this game for the updated rosters and updated Franchise Mode. The new storyline portion, player morale, and in-depth offseason makes this game quite fun. The game play seems better and more realistic. The Hitstick is a real fun feature and is easy to pull off. The graphics aren't perfect and once in a while I see the linemen glitch where they blink different sizes, but it's nothing that takes away once the play starts. Overall, if you're into building a franchise, understand the strategy of football, and don't expect real-life graphics, this is a great game. BUT, I did buy ESPN 2k5 b/c I'm curious to see how they're game matches up after they made a competitive move to lower their game's price to $20."
5,EA SPORTS DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!,"I know all you Madden-users out there eventually became sickly tired of 2004's gameplay and later on in the year devoted your time to other games. With Madden 2005, however, the situation seems different. With a suped-up franchise mode that you all have read about, and suttle improvements including a new fan-mode and the addition of 'the hit stick,' it seems like I'll be playing this years' version well into next year. It's really worth more than the $45 you put down."
4,AWESOME game to play on the SONY PLAYSTATION 2,"Madden NFL 2005 is going to be a REALLY TOTAL AWESOME game to playI give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH it to buy & play this game on the Sony Playstation 2 game systemThis is a REALLY MUST HAVE GAME TO BUY & playOfficial U.S Playstation Magazine give the game call Madden NFL 2005 for the Sony Playstation 2 GAME OF THE MONTH"
1,you got ripped,i cant belive you guys got ripped. ok first its not the game that sucks the game kicks ass. its that i cant beilve you ppl bought this version. for a extra 5 bugs you could have got the collecters addition that is way better. more games like madden classics and some of the ps1 games. and a hours worth of movies. it is a really cool game and it was worth the money. i give collecters addition 5 starts. but the regular virsion 1 star. you got ripped.
2,not that good,i got this game as a present for my birfday. i really don't like it.it is too boring and gets old fast. i am going to sell it and get espn 2k5 instead.ALL PRAISE TO ALLAH!!!
1,madden football is [...],madden is the stupidest [...] game ive ever played. it is so [...] repeated every year maybe a couple of changes. [...]i could buy madden 2001 and keep it for 5 years and be satisfied [...] just [...]. and john madden is the most annoying announcer ive ever heard. buy NFL 2k5 much better choice
1,just like 2004 but upgraded,"sort of dull. this is just like madden 2004 on offense but the defense is a little better. its not worth $30 but its worth about 20 dollars. personally, i like 2k5 nfl better but its all a matter of taste."
4,Madden 2005 is almost here,"Madden is a popular series of football games. It has been the best selling football series for years, and this version looks good. The PS2 and Xbox versions will have online gameplay, and the Gamecube version may have a link up feature if a GameBoy Advance version is released. The graphics look improved, and there will be some new features. Madden's main rival is the ESPN football videogame series. If you're a Madden videogame fan, then vote ""yes this review was helpful"". This version should be great."
4,cool football,"in this game you can play football! You can throw the football, catch the football, and even run with the football. You can make your own football teams and players. and make crazy fans too. You can paint on their stomachs to say 'hi mom'. it is funny. i like this game alot because it is about football."
4,Madden 2005,This game is a blast and if you have NCAA 2005 you can export a class and take your heisman all star and make him into the NFL MVP.
4,Good but not great,"The Good: the franchise mode is outstanding, the storyline central makes this the best sim ever. Fun Defense, better tackling.The Bad: Hard to run, your running back can almost never beat someone one-on-one. You slow down when you run at an angle versus North South, this makes your back slow in comparison to LB's. Blocking, the OL is dumb and the FB is dumber."
4,bought madden and espn but like this one much better,i've had both madden 2005 and espn 2k5 and i like this madden game much better. its more fun to play. for example: in 2k5 the receiver never catches the ball but in madden the receiver catches the ball.the action in this game seems faster and more intense. having both i really enjoy madden more because a person can actually play defense with this one unlike in espn where the computer just plays defense more or less.i only spent $17 on this brand new so i feel i really got my money's worth. i use to be a die hard espn fan until i purchased this. i really like this game. it has so many options in practice that the game seems just like on tv.
4,la la la,its a football game....it does everything right...or atleast i didnt notice any mistakes....so why 4 and not 5?...its a football game...its a sports game...these games get boring after awhile...its the same thing over and over....comes with the genre
1,Madden 2004 was better and so is ESPN2K5,Worse graphics than 2004. Worse controls than 2004. Crazy AI that doesn't make the game anymore fun just more frustrating. Seems slugish at times. Don't waste your money go pick up last years copy of 2004 if you don't have it or pick up ESPN2K5 both are way better.
1,FOOTBALL SHOULD BE FUN....NOT THIS!!!!!,"OK SO EA IMPROVES THE MADDEN SERIES BY 10% EVERY YEAR AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUY THE NEW GAME EVERY YEAR. WHY?? JUST BUY LAST YEARS FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS INSTEAD OF BUYING A NEW EDITION EVERY YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY SO DULL I PLAYED FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS AND SOLD IT. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. WHAT A WASTE OF CASH. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT ITS TOO STERILE...IF THAT IS REALISTIC THEN WELL, THATS OK."
3,BLAH!!,"Hey, I've seen this game before. Now where was it??? Oh yes, Madden 2004!!! Yeah, there are subtle differences like actually showing the crowd and Defensive Playmaking, but honestly, it's pretty much the same as its previous release. Let's put it this way, with ESPN 2K5, it's cheaper (woohoo), better graphics, more in depth, and just flat out more fun to play than Madden. Don't get me wrong, this game is good, but not great. As of this review being written, 2K5 has outsold Madden by over 1.5 million copies. Those numbers speak for themselves."
4,Looks awesome!!!!!,"I've played every Madden game since '98, and this sounds like the best one yet! Player's and their jerseys get more in depth. The season sounds much more challenging not only has the A.I. been tuned just right but because it won't allow you to sign everyone you want, sort of what i do. It also has what I've been waiting for: a ""power hit"" button that allows you to make showstopping plays that frequently cause fumbles and injuries.Everyone who has bought and enjoyed past Madden games will LOVE this one. Even people who don't like the Madden seies should still go out and buy it because I am sure that you won't regret it. I know that I'm going to."
5,very good game,I played this game at my friend's house. It is the coolest football game on the market. The graphics are awesoume. I reccomend that you get this game!
3,Best Buy,"This game is by far the best madden game to come out. The question everybody is asking is ""Is it better than espn"". Yes and no. It all depends what you think is important. If you like solid gameplay and fast technique get espn. But umfortunatly madden may not beat espn in different categories,but lets face it is and all around good buy. It's cheap it's exciting and I'm not gonna blow all the secrets but it has lots of differnt modes and ranges in different gameplay that if your on a budget and you want the all around best game get Madden."
3,above average treatment of difficult subject but pace too slow,"My favorite parts were the tense interactions between headstrong FBI agent Kelly and the older and more sophisticated Taiwan-US diplomat (Wendy Crewson). However Kelly's friendship to Ming didnt ring true and 75% of the scenes moved too slowly. The opening scene (airport shoot-out) was actually the most exciting part of the entire film. Too bad the director couldnt maintain the same pace throughout. I dont expect the excitement of ""Bourne Identity"" but this was more boring than a simple made-for-TV movie like ""Remember Me."" Overall it's not suspenseful enough to be a thriller and I dont recommend it unless you're a fan of Ms. Crewson. She had more sizzle than anyone or anything else."
5,Formosa Betrayed,"Excellent movie! It honestly depicts the ""Era of White Terror"" under the KMT authoritarian regime from 1950s to 1980s. Taiwanese suffered persecution under the longest Martial Law in the world, from 1949 to 1987, imposed by the Chinese KMT administration. Learning the history is to prevent human tragedy and repressive regime from happening again."
4,A Little Strange,"This is a good CD, however two of the songs on here are taken from the Weekend Players CD. (A much better CD.) I had to listen to both to confirm it, I almost thought someone had changed the CD on me.While I liked this music, it seemed a bit hard to follow and didn't keep my interest the way Armada Groove, Zero 7, and other artists do."
2,Puffs of magic,2 1/2Slightly juiced downtempo usually falls prey to simplistic songwriting and bland beats even if maintaining the credible background consistency of production soul-finesse.
2,"dull, dull, dull","I'm convinced that I've wound up with the used copy of this album that the earlier Seattle reviewer had such a hard time getting rid of. Reading such glowing reviews here, and liking ""similar"" music like Zero 7 and Tosca, I snapped up the one (used) copy in the store. Disappointing, to say the least. On first listen it seemed, like the earlier reviewer said, cheesy and corny. I shut it off after about the third track. Then I thought it might be decent background music for work, where I have to avoid being too caught up in music anyway. Wrong! This album is just not good. It's almost mindnumbingly repetitive, so much so that instead of soothing and lulling me like this sort of music is supposed to do, it started to drill into my brain like some sort of torture device. And hard as I ended up trying, I just couldn't detect any kind of personality behind the music. It seems almost entirely derivative, though there are some nice effects with chimes and bells or something."
2,uh . . . no,"There was something a bit corny and cheesy about caia that just didn't appeal to me. There's a warm, all engulfing fuzzy feel to this disc but it left a bad taste in my mouth. It seemed a bit too over produced and the music came across as murky and muddled. I tried selling my copy at three different used music stores and no one wanted to buy it. If you like your downtempo a bit cheesy and forgetable, the magic dragon is for you. Not a single track reached out and grabbed me and the disc kind flowed in such a manner that eventually every track started to sound a like. I was finally able to unload my copy. Not a bad disc but there is SO much better out there."
1,Very disappointed,I was pretty happy with almost all of the other Complete Handbooks but I was REALLY disappointed with this one. I found it lacking a lot of information specific to realms and gods. You're better off buying the Faiths & Avatars or Player's Options: Spells & Magic books as they are more detailed. Save up your money and upgrade from this handbook to something that will be more useful to you.
2,"Not at all useless, but not entirely useful either","This could have been a lot better. I don't own it. There's a reason for that. I am DMing 3 campaigns and playing in 4 right now. I play every character imaginable. For players, this book doesn't help much. A few ideas to get started on a new priesthood for a new character, but that's about it. For DM's, it's a great way to help customize your own world if you tire of Ravenloft, Forgotten Realms, etc. However, owning this book is not necessary for that. Check it out at your public library for a week."
2,Could be better,"I have been a gamer for many years across many worlds and more often than not I play a priest. This book, while providing one or two decent kits, does not have a lot of new information and is not as big a resource as some of the other PHB extensions such as the fighter's handbook, or others. If you are looking for variations on the typical cleric, I would recommend buying a book specific to the world that you would be playing in, such as ""Faiths and Avatars of the Realms"" written for the Forgotten Realms world (one of my personal favorites). If you are looking to complete a set then by all means buy it, but otherwise I would look elseware"
2,"hey it helps some, not much but some","the book lacked most of what has made the other additions to this series great. As stated before you can probably find all the info included therein as well as some more useful stuff in the Faiths and Avatars as well as the Spells and Magic supplement. IT's ok if you just want to play a boring cleric( but then again wouldn't you just be better off taking the example from the players handbook). Take my word for it, save yourself the money to spend on something that would be really worth your while, but if you have to look at it just flip through it, you can get the important stuff outta there fairly quick."
2,"Not half bad - or, for that matter, half good...","Discounting the uninteresting or unusable parts (which still take up about half the book), The Complete Priest's Handbook is a pretty useful source. The main problem is in the half the book that's taken up by flotsam and fluff.The reader from Detroit was very right in saying that ""the... specialty priests are vastly underpowered compared to the priests in any other AD&D work""; hence why it's necessary to tweak and add to them extensively. The powers are also so restricting that they're worth ignoring entirely; the only thing they'll do is make dozens of AD&D pantheons clones of each other.The main purpose of this book is to give some ideas on what gods may exist and what their priesthoods are like. If you do buy this and use it in your campaign, however, DON'T USE ANY OF THE SPECIALTY PRIESTHOODS AS IS... It would be an insult to priests everywhere!"
2,Best thing to do with this book...,Read it in the bookstore as a reference book when you are creating your world and putting Gods into it. But thats it...leave it there. This is the book in my TSR library with the most dust on it. But I pass it to new DM's more then i read it so it's not completely useless unless you don't know that many-would be DM's.
1,Why bother? It's all been duplicated elsewhere.,"The Complete Priest's Handbook is one of those TSR works that is almost completely replaceable with other works.First, the Faith creation system and specialty priests are vastly underpowered compared to the priests in any other AD&D work. You're better off using the class customization rules from Player's Option: Spells & Magic, or even raiding a world-specific work and tweaking the priests.The kits are generally boring, and most are essentially identical to similarly-named fighter or wizard kits. The personalities are okay, but any experienced roleplayer won't need them, whereas an inexperienced player would be better off looking at potrayals of clergymen in general fiction for archtypes.Finally, the equipment and combat rules are essentially identical to those in the Complete Fighter's Handbook.In short, it isn't very useful."
2,get faiths and avatars instead,"faiths and avatars and demihuman deities come up with better kits/specialty priests. personally, i prefer that the campaign filler stuff come at the end of the book instead of at the front but that's just me. for me the book didn't seem to ignite an interest in the priest class as much as the other two books."
1,"All the hits, but outtake mixes - skip it.","Sure, all the hits are here, but they all sound slightly ""off"". These are NOT the mixes of these songs that were used for the original albums and singles, and in many cases the songs have also been cut in length.I would actually rate this collection NO stars, because it really serves no purpose. People who are buying a ""hits"" collection, which this is, want to hear the EXACT versions of the songs they remember. People who are looking for alternate versions of songs are not going to be satisfied with just getting the second-rate mix that was not deemed the best to go on the final album master.Unfortunately, the old vinyl ""Firefalls Greatest Hits"", which had the hits in their original album versions, does not seem to be available on cd. That leaves the listener to buy all of the original album cds and make their own compilation."
3,Famous Last Words will never become famous,"""Famous Last Words"" is decidedly a minor novel, but it may be worth an hour or two of your time., if you're interested in pre-World War II aristocratic Europe. Characters include Von Ribbentrop, the creepy Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany, Walter Schellenberg, a creepy SS official, Elsa Maxwell, a creepy society columnist, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, creepy parasites. It's a cast of characters that will have you longing for the delightful, natural joyfulness of Darth Vader."
5,The most enthralling and captivating books I have read,"I have not read a book before that kept me so intereseted, in a long time. Timothy Findley is a genius in his writings."
1,A big disapointment,"I thought this would be familiar tunes for young and old in the family; not so in this family! It has a few tunes most people know, but mostly they are show tunes from Christmas movies put out by I think, Warner Bros. Keep looking!"
3,Good,"This book has some of the ""new"" favorites as well as classics.It has ""Christmas Shoes"". Maybe we'll be able able to perform it sometime (if we can ever get through it without crying)!"
4,Headbanging stuff,"Considering the direction that Gillan went in his solo career - his music made Deep Purple look rather like a kitten. Gillan is still in dynamic vocal form here and singing with wild abandon - by the time he'd re-entered Purple in 1984, his voice was somewhat neutered. Nevertheless, this is heavy bombastic stuff. Everything else about the music has been said here, but I'd like to add: what I like about these reissues is: a) the extra tracks and b) the liner notes by Gillan himself and others. Well packaged!"
5,What a great book,"This Book ""What Zoey Saw"" is a great book. Things are revealed that you would never expect and things change with characters. The so called perfect relationship that Mr. and Mrs. Passmore had, change very quickly in this book. Zoey and Lucas grow apart after Lucas tried to pressure Zoey into have sex with him. Jake, Zoey's ex-boyfriend comforts her after things happen bettween Zoey's parents. Claire and Jake relationship isnt working out because of Jake had an affair and his drug problems. But atleast Nina and Ben, are doing great. Christopher has been trying to deal with his fight that he got in, and he buys a gun to help him get over it and get some pay back. But theres so much more in this book and there a great cliff hangers.This book was a really good book, I hope everyone reads it and I cant wait for ""Lucas Gets Hurt."""
4,To close for comfort,"Here we see Zoey tring to come with the fact that her family may be falling apart around her. In this book you cannot help feeling sorry for Zoey and Benjamin as many teenagers today have to face the exact same problem. It is a realistic acount of family problems, very well written."
1,"If you think canned cheese on a croissant is funny, this is for you ...","I ordered several DVDs on early American history for my daughter. We loved the PBS and Biography ones; this one was not to our taste. First, the jokes are silly: he can't say croissant, he squeezes canned cheese on a croissant, he takes a call from his wife and asks for his snoopy toothbrush and spiderman underroos, etc. Perhaps the intended audience is 4-6 year olds. Second, they do not have the strongest historians on their writing staff. e.g. He makes fun of Abigail Adams for her poor spelling, when at that time, spelling was not standardized. You could make fun of the other founding fathers for the same flaw. If you know American history, this DVD will drive you crazy with all the little mistakes...p.s. this is presented by the National Day of Prayer."
2,There's a reason this isn't on a legit label,"For those who gave this a good review they probably never saw Beck live; if they did it wasn't one of his better performances. Originally I had this as an 80's bootleg from Japanese TV. This is only a step up from that bootleg, and a very small step at that. This is the best they could do in quality? Luthaker? Terrible...think he did an 8 ball before hitting the stage. Jumping around manically w/ non-stop shredding and a horrible processed tone. Santana is on here too. Whatever he did is totally forgettable, as is most of this disc. Buy this only if your a major fan of these guys. Otherwise save your dough."
2,Disappointing,I love the Eyewitness books but this video is disappointing. The presentation is poorly organized and there's a low-budget feel to some of it. I learned a few things from watching it but I definitely don't recommend purchase (I borrowed a copy from my library).
4,great album,"This is a great album the beat and rythms are full of soul, and the writing is up and not the ""in your face gonna tear up the place"" writing, You still have to paint a picture and these brothers are truly talented."
3,Great sense of place but jarring jumps,"About: A year-long chronicle of life on rural farms. Horses, weather, birds, insects and gardens are prominently featured.Pros: Wonderful sense of place, well written.Cons: Klinkenborg jumps around between several locations: Montana, Wyoming, New York, Colorado, Utah etc. It would have been much less jarring if he stuck to one place. Doesn't note until the last page of the book that this January-December organized work was not only written in several places but also written over several years and was originally just a bunch of essays. It would've been much more helpful if this information was given at the beginning of the book, so the reader knew what to expect. It would probably have flowed much better if he actually wrote the book as a book and not just tried to turn a bunch of essays into a book."
1,Do not waste your time/money,"There is an Iranian proverb that says (paraphrasing it):there are many walnuts in the don's house, but each andeveryone of them is accounted for.It is true that the Khomeini regime has subjected the Iranianpeople to an unprecedented level of repression (execution, torture,imprisonment, stoning to death) in Iran, but that does not mean theIranian people have forgotten the crimes committed by the Pahlaviregime, its evil SAVAK and the very role that Ashraf Pahlavi herselfplayed in those crimes. Let alone the money her family stolefrom the Iranian people.It was this very repressive nature of the Pahalvi regime that led touprising and revolution in Iran. Unfortunately, by the time of therevolution, almost all nationalists, intellectuals, human rights activitistsand such were either murdered by the Pahlavi regime or were imprisoned,thus paving the road for Khomeini and his gang to take over.You wont see any of the above turth in Ms. Pahlavi's book."
2,Extremely one sided view of Iran's political history,This book is poorly written and expresses a one sided view of Iran's history. It is extremely shalow and lacks the usual intelect that an average reader would expect from a book in this category. I am very disappointed in this book.
1,Time for The Real Truth,"This is a great book if you enjoy historical FICTION. From Ashraf's point of view, her family came from nobility and were born to power. The reality is that the Shah's father was a poor miliatary man. He couldn't feed his family, but later rose to power through cunning and force.In this book Ashraf writes about all the good works the Shah did in Iran. That's like saying Saddam Hussein was progressive. For instance, in both cases women did have more rights - nothing close to the West - but more. But at a high cost of living under a dictator.The current government in Iran is abysmal, but the Shah's rule was horrible, too, maybe a little less so. However, victims of SAVAK would never agree with that."
4,Easy to read and its free.,"Great history lesson. If you want to learn about Buddha, his life, and his teachings this book is a good start."
5,Nice collection on my Kindle,"For the price, you can't go worng. Helps build a nice library at a reasonable price. You won't be sorry."
3,Read twice for better understandin,"New to learning Buddahism, this book might be some difficult for a beginner like myself. It was easier to understand with a 2nd reading."
4,gospel of Budha,Very enlightening and interesting to see a philosophy that's almost non-heard in the western world. A must read to everyone. Beautiful perspective.
2,"Unlike Buddha the book is lacking compassion, warmth and love like the works of Harrer and Tenzin Gyatso.","If you're looking for insights into Buddhism you would be much better off getting the ""Buddhism for Dummies"" guide (despite it's name it is written by two lovely gentlemen who know a great deal.) the writer here does not have the warmth that people like The Dalai Lama embody. He spends most if it trying to propel it above Abrahamic religions, trying to claim it to be a better religion. Buddha would not care to try and top J.C or Muhammad and would instead sit down and have some butter tea with them. the writer misses the point entirely and is a poor example of Buddhist spiritual living."
4,Good compilation,A very good compilation of the teachings of Buddha. The translation is good but the formatting for Kindle is a little iffy.
5,"For 'iCharger' users, this is form + function = perfection","If you have more than just a handful (we have 20) iPad chargers, this is what you need. It perfectly accommodate ten iPad or MacBook/Pro/Air chargers. Of course, smaller iPhone/iPod chargers would work just fine, too, but for those, you may just use something else with a smaller footprint.Take a look at the customer picture to see how well it fits. The chargers do touch each other after you plug it in, but it's not a problem. It's just nice and neat once you get all ten plugged into it."
5,works great,"I like it, I have 3 of these I like it because it is heavy duty it also has 10 sockets it cost a bit more but it is worth it the company sent it fast I would give the surge master and the company a 5 star all the way"
5,industrial looking,"Widely spaced receptacles allows for the use of power bricks. What is lacks in style, it makes up or in functionality and brawn."
4,Could be better designed.,"This cooler works well, keeps everthing cold and is easy to drain melted ice. The handle also seems sturdy and is easy to use. The main flaw with this cooler is the axle location. There is very limited ground clearance (1"") and because the wheeels are set so far in, it takes a lot of tilt to pull the cooler at a comfortable height."
4,Great Cooler But Way too Expensive Online,I bought this exact cooler earlier today for like 70% of the price listed online at a big box discount retailer. It is a great cooler but save youself some money and buy it locally.
4,A photographic book.,"Finally,a devoted book purely on Prevost buses.Another Iconographix bus book.Covers the history of Prevost buses right through to the latest models including several photos of the motohome variants.An interesting book."
5,Int Alg Textbook,"Came fast, gratly packaged, and condition was just as expected! Very Satisfied with everything and the price!"
3,Be Carefull!,"Be Careful. My teacher said I need the edition with the pear on the cover. She said the earlier editions had a plum and an orange, but I got the wrong edition! Apparently in paperback there is more then one edition with a pear on it. Make sure it is the right one and you are good to go. I didn't have to wait long for it to come in the mail."
4,Very Complete,"This book won't let you get stuck, it explains all concepts clearly. It offers a good beginning algebra review, and gives you a thorough dose of the tougher stuff."
1,Intermediate Algebra Book,"I never received the book I ordered. I did e-mail the person I bought the book from three times. They responded to my first e-mail advising me that it may take a couple weeks to get the product. My first e-mail was sent before the final arrival date of the book. My contract with the seller was that the book would arrive by May 26, 2009. The other two e-mails were sent after the May 26, 2009 arrival date, but the seller has not responded. I am starting the 3rd week of my class so I am going to now purchase the book from the school. I had to rate this item with something because my message could not be sent so I rated it as a one, but really cant rate the product because I never got it. Please advise how I go about getting my money back since it was never received. I am assuming it is lost in the mail system somewhere, and if I do receive it, I will return to sender once I get my money back.Thanks for your time."
2,Book needs more explanations and less fluff,"Book needs more explanations on problems and less ""Study habit reminders"" and other fluffy stuff that I just skip over. What student has time to read the ""extra optional stuff""?In my humble opinion, this book doesn't explain problems well.It doesn't explain WHY. It assumes you know WHY problems are solved in certain ways.For example, on page 110, she throws a property at you:""If A is a positive number, then | X | < a is equivalent to -a < X < a.""It would really help me understand this property if I knew WHY| X | < a is equivalent to -a < X < a.The answer book should explain more also - especially for problems that are different from the examples.I do like the idea of concept checks though."
1,DVD for intermediate Alegebra,"I bought this product for my daughter. The first product had to be replaced because the DVD was damaged and not working and the picture and audio quality was poor. The replacement I received is no better either. In the second product the CD does not work on my computer, some times it works and other times it does not even open. However this DVD does work slightly better than the previous one. This frustrates me to no end and I regret having purchased this product. I believe any product available in this day and age should be user friendly."
1,Very unsatisfied.,I have waited for this book for 2 months now and i still have not recieve anything from it. I will spread my word to this link and tell everyone to reconsidered their order form.
2,A very condenced algebra book,Hard to understand and read this book is not the best you can get for a beginner.
5,good battery,"I already used this specific type and brand of battery on my APC UPS, and have no problems, that's why i bought the same brand, and this seller has the better price and fast shipping"
5,Best of the Madden series!,"I started playing Madden in 2000 with Madden 2001 on N64. the graphics were ok, but there weren't as many game modes as there are now. The next year, I got Madden 2002, and still it didn't wow me. The year after that I got Gamecube and skipped Madden 2003. Last year I got Madden 2004 and it was amazing. I decided to get Madden 2005 this year and it's unbelieveable. The new Features are amazing:Hit Stick: Bowl over someone when you have an open hit on him.Create-A-Fan Mode: One of the greatest new features in the game this year. Create an ultimate fan for your ultimate team.Upgraded ""Franchise Mode"": Newspaper, EA Radio Show featuring Tony Bruno,practice and more.All these features and more are in Madden 2005. This is a must buy game."
4,Price worth the Video,"The video included in the box set is worth the price of the CD. The remastering of the tracks is well done. The original CD release always sounded so flat and lifeless. The only complaint is the use of a crummy demo version of ""Precious"" my favorite song."
2,Compilation with little that is rare.,"I was hoping for rarities, but it mostly has all the songs from the original tracks. The DVD is the most worthwhile part, in my opinion."
4,Good but could be longer,"I enjoy this Hilary Burnett workout, along with the advanced pilates workout. The intermediate workout is about 30 minutes, and includes some key pilates exercises. She explains the moves in better detail than in the advanced workout.I do wish it was a little longer, but overall, I am satisfied with with this DVD and find it effective when alternated with (and used to work up to) the advanced routine."
4,Good Pilates DVD,"Good pace, good variety of exercises and stretches. Tips provided by the instructor are excellent. Well categorized as an intermediate-level program."
4,Good deal,Good deal on a great product. This is much cheaper than you will find in a local pet supply store.
5,nice music,I use this as background music in my Chiropractic office. It is congruent with the other music I have. It is soothing and brings a great ambiance to the office.
3,The banal and fascinating,"A dreadful novel, pretentious, arty and clearly indebted to Gertrude Stein in its alliterative passages of nonsensical phrases. The characters are cardboard, the plot non-existent and good chunks are completely unintelligible. Saying all that, I found the book fascinating as a historical document of gay life in New York of the early 30's. Village Bohemia, gay bars, the drag balls, cruising on Riverside Drive, gay bashing, rent parties are all here, and written by those who lived it. Those looking for sex scenes will be deeply disappointed because none exist...just the fact that the male characters went to bed or paired off with each other was risqué enough to put terror in the hearts of potential publishers. But as an illustration of George Chauncey's Gay New York none better could be found, an authentic document of the times. Worth every affected paragraph."
5,Most of these reviewers don't get it.,"I'm giving this record 5 stars to offset the crybabies who want Elvis to sound like the old days. GET OVER IT! This is his most complex and mature recording to date. Elvis's dalliances with Burt Bacharach, Bill Frisell and the rest have come to play here in a complete album of songs that show Costello at his best. His songwriting skills are better than ever--this disc will one day be called a classic. In fact, I predict it will win a Grammy. Enjoy."
5,A masterpiece from the post-punk Dylan.,"THE Elvis has finally done it. He has delivered the masterpiece of his career. In a 15 song onslought of energy and amazing arangements, Mr. Costello has honed his craft and mixed in a modern sound with his hypodermic-sharp lyrics to deliver the album his longtime fans knew he could make. There is nary a dud here as each song has deceptive gravity pulling you in with each listen. If you are a casual fan with only a couple of EC's albums, this is one you will want to have. If you are not a fan, this actually might make you one!"
2,When I Was Cruel - I Was MUCH Better,"45 is pretty good. And, um, yeah. Ok, now be honest, is there a single song on this album (all 60 minutes plus of it) that is better than any single song on:Armed ForcesImperial BedroomMy Aim Is TrueGet Happyor the underated Blood + ChocolateIn my opinion, nope, not a one. I guess everyone is excited because When I Was Cruel isn't as horrid as Spike, or Mighty Like a Rose. But sad to say, if this is the best he can do, then the thrill is gone indeed."
2,I think I'm done with Elvis,"Yes, it's about the best he can do now, very slick and polished and somehow completely lacking. I guess he has just left me behind...or I've left him...or something. I was pretty excited by the first track or two when this album came out, but I ended up only listening to this CD three or four times...nothing caught in my mind..."
2,Emperor has no clothes,"The tuneless, witless, ponderous chants (""I believe we just become a speck of dust"" x10000), noisy, overloaded guitars, and overfamiliar patented Elvis phrasing and vocal tricks overwhelm the couple of decent songs on this record. And the horn arrangements? Uggh. Just horrendous. Critics and fans seem to be suffering from mass delusion on this one, and I would be bet you dollars to donuts that no one is playing this as often as their hyperbolic praises would lead us to believe. I guess I am mostly alone in thinking the songs he wrote for his project with Anna Sofie squash like a grape the ones on this record."
4,Elvis is still in the building!,"(4-1/2 stars) This is my current favorite CD. It's also a return to the ""Golden Days"" of Elvis Costello, and his best album in many years. Right from the first cut, the jumpin' and jivin' ""45,"" I knew I was gonna dig the CD. I loved the churning fever of ""Dissolve,"" the title track with its James-Bondish rock-noir feel, and pretty much all the other songs too. It's funny how subjective music appreciation can be. When Elton John's critically acclaimed CD came out last year, heralded as his ""return to rock,"" it did nothing for me at all - just another humdrum EJ twilight album. But now Mr. Costello has put out his ""return to rock"" (equally acclaimed so far), and I can't get anough of it! It's certainly good that he's back to doing this kind of stuff after all of those boring collaborations with string quartets, jazz ensembles and opera singers."
1,Not my cup of tea.,If E.C. was trying to capture some of the originality and fire he had early in his career than he missed the mark. This cd is a huge disappointment for me for the reviews seemed to lean towards something much more than what is offered here. I suggest you buy the new remasters of his early work from Rhino Records as it is all excellent.
1,Enough already,"I bought ""MY AIM IS TRUE"" in December, 1977, and followed this man's every album and single, all the way through to MIGHTY LIKE A ROSE in 1991. But I finally realized the harsh truth -- he's HAD it. I think Costello used to believe in something -- maybe anger, maybe rock and roll, maybe hatred or lust -- but SOMETHING. Now I think he just wants to churn out more records and to rehash the same old ""revenge and guilt"" trip for the thousandth time. He used to be a nihilist in the best sense -- smashing through all the false values of pop love songs and finding the lust and terror and power games underneath. Now he's a nihilist in the manner of -- oh, maybe the way a bad Las Vegas singer is nihilistic. He pretends to be involved in the craft of songwriting or the art of it, or some new political problem or his ""spooky girlfriend"" -- but he's really just ""going through the motions"" as he wrote once back when he wasn't. He's got nothing left to say but he still wants your money. Stay away."
3,"Mediocre, poorly produced.","The thing that gets me about this record is how bad the production is. Everything sounds distorted and compressed, almost as if you're listening to it sreamed over the net. Some of the songs stand out (45, When I Was Cruel No. 2, Spooky Girlfriend, Alibi), but the rest are pretty mediocre."
1,The Imposter Lives Again!,"I think Elvis Costello actually died 15 years ago and this person has taken his place, writing (or I should say overwriting) a bunch of meaningless songs. There's not one song on here that is better than the worst song on any of his first 5 or 6 records, or that I would want to hear again. He should quit and just keep rereleasing his wonderful early work."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I bought this on faith that the real EC was back. The guy who could twist meanings and tunes to places you never expected. The guy who authored the lines ""thinking about grand larceny, smoking the everlasting cigarette of chastity"".Nope. While it's better than much of his post-Blood and Chocolate stuff, this album is still, frankly, pretty boring. Oh, there's a couple good songs that'd merit a mix tape inclusion, but I'm not going to listen to it many more times.Ah, Elvis, mighty are the fallen."
4,The man is a prophet...,"OK. He's a man and a prophet.. Whatever. If you want to know what is happening in the world just under the radar of the 5 senses, listen to this CD and you may get some answers. Give it a go, will ya!"
4,Excellent Album!,"I've been an Elvis Costello fan for years now. I've waited ages for this album to come out and I wasn't disappointed. It's not classic Elvis, but every artist needs room to grow. Costello has grown nicely. If you're a die-hard EC fan, you need this album."
4,Back to basics,"It appears that Mr. Mac Manus has gotten ballads,guest performances,and producing for other artists out of his system for now and has returned with an album of songs worthy of ""The Angry Young Man"" label he was tagged with in the late 70's. With 3/4 of The Attractions back in the fold, ""When I Was Cruel"" is filled with great musicianship, and of course the lyrics more like tracks from ""Brutal Youth"" than ""Painted From Memory""While songs like ""Tear Your Head Off"" sound just a little too familiar, the time signature and experimental sounding ""15 Petals"" reassure you that Elvis is back. LOUD guitars and the always amazing keyboard/piano work of Steve Nieve make this the album Costello fans have been longing for."
5,"Thank you, Elvis",Finally...he's back. This album brought tears to my eyes. Did the Sofie von Otter album make you wonder? Wonder no more. Buy it.
2,Dissapointed,"Did not like this album. 45, spooky girlfriend, and tart are good songs but the rest was to my ears pretty much unlistenable -- where have all the catchy lyrics and melodies gone? His newer singing style worked very well w/ Burt B and in concert with Steve Nieve, but for ""rock"" or ""new wave"" style album it detracts. Besides that the backing music is too strong and hard -- give me more keyboards, flutes, harps etc.What I really miss are the interesting and frankly unbelievably beutiful musical arrangements which can be found on many EC records; the first five albums which are essential, plus Spike (superb music and lyrics start to finish); imperial bedroom, king of america, goodbye cruel world, mightly like rose.The Beatles did not put out a bad album and there is no reason why EC, who is equally talented, should either. Dissapointed."
4,That Voice! That Sound! It's got to be....,"I'm in no way a hard-core Elvis Costello fan, at least I wasn't before I picked up this album. I remember tracks from his work with Burt and Bill, or from ""that"" movie.... but this album has secured Elvis Costello's place in my CD rotation and in my head --I'm sure you'd love for me to name good tracks and bad tracks... but the fact is.. it's up to you to take this in on your own. GET READY for something GREAT."
5,hard funk,"this group gives up the goods on this gem.this group was as good as any funk band from the 70's.fire,roller coaster,skin tight are mad jams.i want to be free with baddest drum opening ever on record.the horns were funky.sugarfoot is a genius.the band paved the way for other funk groups out of ohio.this music is still banging."
2,Never again,"You get what you pay for .. not what I expected; hair too wirey, not easy to manage, probably best for costume use; I gave it away"
5,Exactly like the picture,"It took about 10 minutes of teasing the wig apart with my fingers before it looked like the picture, but then it was perfect. It also fit my (average female size) head perfectly. I wore it to a disco party all night with zero problems."
2,Does not look like picture,"I ordered the brown wig a received a black one. Didnt look like the photo shown, it looked more like a black clown wig."
2,Product NOT Like Picture,"The wig you receive in the mail is not the wig in the picture. It is more of a curly afro instead of a more frizzy, puffy afro. However, I did alot of cutting on the wig and it turned out just fine for my purposes. I used it for a Lamont Sanford halloween costume."
1,not at all what shown in picture,This is not the same product as the one shown in the amazon site. I've received a poor quality wig instead. Quite disappointed
3,3 1/2 stars,"The best way I can describe this book (I don't mean this as an insult) is as a sort of dumbed-down Human Side of Enterprise. Once you get past the bad writing, bad characters (most of them, in fact, seem exactly the same), and the bad jokes (there are many), you've got a decent book. The author shares some great insights into management (particularly in marketing, which I assume is his specialty). I found myself cheering for Manion as he tried hard to transform himself into the person he wanted to be. If you are looking for a quick, digestible book on management this is a good place to start. Keep in mind, though, that if you don't particularly need this simplified format, there are much more rewarding books out there."
3,Interesting book.,I liked the book. One of the confusing things was that the characters names were sometimes mentioned first name and in the next sentence the name was of the last name. The book was interesting.CJ
4,Our Christian heritage in a nutshell,Rus Walton has put a lifetime of research and personal experience into this work. A must read for those who would wonder how this nation acheived greatness and what it will take to re-capture that position. A real eye opener for university indoctrinated mind.
5,Better than Python,The acting sketches are equal to the Python ones. What makes this funnier is the musical satire provided by the Bonzo Dog musical group.
4,good anime,"good anime, the only the i don't like about this set is the fact it doesn't come in a box set. oh and another thing that makes me mad is that i saw this product at FYI for only 26$."
2,Forgetful,"Ai yori aoshi like most romantic, emotional driven, and overly dramatic oniichan complexes are utterly annoying. The cliche story of all the women having a crush or some love complex with the main antagonist has become redundant. The story lacks connection, for the feelings or situations that the anime tries to convey falls short from being the genuine article. For a more engrossing story, one should look into NANA. The anime provides a more fluid and real-life experience to the table and the characters all have a life of their own that blossom/deteriorate during the development of the story."
3,fast - IF I can get my compact flash card inserted,"I am running WinXP Pro. I plugged it in and right away I got the 4 mapped drives (one drive for each slot on the IntelliFlash). So off to a good start.Then I tried popping in a Canon Compact Flash I card. It would not go in. After some manuvering and jiggling, it went in, but the green light never went on next to the drive - and it wasn't being read.I then tried to pop in a Viking CF card and had the same problem.After much jiggling and pushing the card in (with the Canon card because it was small and I didn't care as much if it broke) - finally the green light lit up and the pictures transferred very fast to my hard drive.So now I'm not sure if this is a faulty device - or if this is the nature of the beast for this particular product. I'm afraid if I need to continually do this, it will ruin the CF card."
5,Card Reader,Arrived in short time. Item made quite well. Easy to use. Reads many flash sticks. Good size and very portable
2,"Worked fine for years, but it's incompatible with newer cards.","I got this device a few years ago and it worked fine for me. I used it with several types of cards; Compact Flash for a digital camera, SD for a PDA, and a 2GB MicroSD (with the SD adapter) for two phones (LG Shine and BlackBerry Bold). But I recently purchased a 4GB microSDHC card and found that while the card worked in the phones, that card wouldn't work with this Viking IntelliFlash USB 6 in 1 Memory Reader. Times change and so does the technology.I recommend you consider something like the ""Kingston 19-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader FCR-HS219/1""...which I just ordered from Amazon."
1,Potential problems - you get what you pay for,"Very similar experience to that described by Jennifer Tomlinson Bohnenberger on May 5th. The Intelliflash reader installed fine on a WinXP machine; however, when the SanDisk 256MB SD card was inserted the files could not be read (corrupted!) When the card went back into the camera two of the photos had been reformatted and could not be read by the camera. Very disappointed in this reader, but then the price should have been a clue. Not worth it - stick with SanDisk or similar companies. Now let's see if Amazon will refund the purchase price. Update: Amazon.com did a refund, no questions asked. Great service."
2,Works but with problems,"What attracted me to this reader was the great price and its features. Installation was straight forward. Even before rebooting, I could see the addition drives appearing on Windows Exploere. Then I notice the intermittent floppy disk access. My floppy drive kept coming on every few seconds, as if it was trying to read a disk. Still the reader worked fine at the point. Then I started getting the blue screen showing USBATA.SYS being the culprit. Now, I leave it unplugged when turning on my PC and plug it in only if I need to use it. I am working with their tech support trying to resolve this. Because their support is weekdays only (no weekends or evenings), I can only call them during the day at work, then try something at home and call them back the next day. It's very tedius process. If I don't get it resolved in a few days, I'd probably return it. I am running Windows 2000 with SP2 on a Dell XPS T500 with 384 MB RAM."
2,Will not work on WIN98,Need a multi card reader for WIN 98? This isn't it.There wasn't any drivers on the install CDRom just 2 (Inaccessable)CDA files.Once I downloaded the drivers it still wasn't seen by windows 98.Tested on a Win XP machine with no problems found yet.Viking should have a better QA program to ensure their product(s) are ready for the consumer with the supporting software.I will give thier support staff a chance to help then I will ship it back if I'm not 110% satisfied.Bottom line-Looks great-Works great on XP-USELESS for WIN98.John
1,NEVER THINK OF IT !!,"I bought this product since I own three products using different card types. When It arrived I was shocked. It is so bulky. After inserting my SD card, it recognized, I could write data to the card no problem, but whenever the camera writes on the card, and I reinsert to read the data, it shows card corrupted !I tried formatting the card on the device and on the camera, no wayAlthough the MMC card uses the same slot, it works perfect.As for the Smart media slot, it formatted the card in a way, that the camera does not recognize.. Now , I can use the card only as a PC mass storage , since the camera can not even format!!The only slot with no problems so far is the compact flash one.By the way, I tried another card, and another device at a friend with the same results.The device does not come with any low level fomat utilities which leaves you helpless after corrupting your cards !!!"
4,Fast Easy and Reliable,"This is a great all-in-one product. Setup was totally painless - plug-and-play as it was intended with WinXP. I didn't even need to use the driver CD that accompanied the reader.I've used this reader with both CompactFlash from my digital camera and memory sticks from my camcorder. Both of them worked flawlessly.Each of the slots in the reader are treated like separate removable drives when I manage files on my computer. It's a little annoying that all of these drives aren't labeled beyond ""Removable drive"", but once you get the hang of the order, this isn't a concern anymore.I highly recommend this reader to anyone who uses a variety of digital devices.PROS* Ease of setup* Performance (SPEED!)* Flexibility / variety of formatsCONS* Lack of labels when browsing PC drives* Ergonomics (it's kinda ugly and it's flat, i.e. it has no angle up toward the user, so you've got to keep it on the edge of your desk to use it one-handed)"
3,Time has moved on,"This was a great product when USB1.1 was the only game in town. Now, USB 2.0 is out (much faster!!) and common on most new (<1 year old) PCs. Should be able to get a similar product (Dazzle for example) that provides both USB 2.0 & 1.1 speeds for <$40 regular, $20-ish on sale."
1,Corrupted first disk I tried,I tried this the first time with a brand new SD bought on vacation - could see pictures fine on camera but when used this Viking memory reader said disk and files corrupted. Was able to retrieve all but first five photos fortunately - unfortunately one of the five photos was a precious one that cannot be retrieved that was the main reason for the trip (daughter and father dancing).
1,Just would not work.,"I got this Viking reader after reading all the negative reviews here. I work on the computer industry and usually do not have problems with installing new devices like these. So even after I read the negative reviews, I figured I could make this work with the right drivers.Boy I was wrong. I first installed the drivers which came on the CD. Windows 2000 recognized all the 4 drives and showed them in Windows explorer. Now when I inserted by Compact flash card, it did not recognize the media and kept asking me to insert the disk in the drive.I tried rebooting multiple times, installing and uninstalling the drivers. No luck. I even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review. That didnt work either.After 2 days of meddling I gave up and shipped it back to amazon.Note: This drive also looks unusually big for a card reader. The photo is not representative of its actual size."
1,Doesn't work with SD Cards,"***This card reader is not compatible with newer SanDisk SD cards***I got the following response from Viking Tech Support on May 17, 2004:""We have had a few customers report seeing problems with some Sandisk cards. It appears to be a compatibility issue with Sandisk's new SD cards and the reader. The new Sandisk cards read/write speeds are faster than their older cards, and this difference may be the cause of the error.Currently Engineering is looking at the problem. When we find a resolution I will send you an update."""
2,Problems with Smartcard,"As soon as I received the reader, I tested with 1 MMC-256M, 2 FlashCards (48 and 256M) and 2 SmartMedia cards (16 and 128M). No problems with the MMC and the FlashCards, but the IntelliFlash was not able to read one of the 2 SmartCards I tested. It seems that it is not able to read SmartCards from some brands.The documentation that comes with the reader is very poor and does not address important information, like the correct way for inserting the SmartCards. I found it after spending some time searching on the Viking website. BTW, you have to insert the SmartCard with the golden contact facing down. I am really not happy with the reader and I don't reccomend it, if your primary goal is reading SmartCards from your digital cameras."
2,If you use SanDisk SD memory cards beware!!!!,"I bought the Viking Intelliflash 6-in-1 USB Flash Memory Reader with the hopes of being able to save battery life on a digital camera. However, on trying an SD memory card from a camcorder I have, it ruined the card and said ""files corrupted"" and I lost all the pics. I read some of the other reviews and realised the problem lied with the SanDisk memory card I used.I later tried a Kingston Memory Card I had bought for the digital camera and it worked fine."
1,Does Not Work With WINDOWS 98,"I purchased this product to use with a second laptop I use for work running on Windows 98. While the product literature claims it works with Windows 98, it DOES NOT! I have been in contact with the company for a period of over three months trying to just get it installed. I am sorry to say that I am disappointed in the customer support who obviously got tired of me and basically ""washed their hands"" of the case leaving me stuck with a product that I have no use of since it doesn't do what it is supposed to do--read memory on Windows 98 platform.In all fairness, I was able to get the product to read flash card memory on another laptop running Windows XP."
1,What is this,"i was really looking forward to watching this DVD, but i was so disappointed, Dont want to judge but when did light and darkness come together, why did Anthony Anderson host it? There was no scriptures said, other than peoples trainers and shoes, awards and achievements, when did God judge the worship we give him, why awards? who is the judge? i felt it was just gospel people showing they can sing and perform, i dont know if GOD RECIEVED ANY GLORY IN THIS. Were people saved? thats our purpose as christians isnt it?"
4,great stuff,"""We were anxious to receive the CDs as we are avid listeners of Blues and Jazz music. However were disappointed at the quality of the music. It was scratchy and difficult to hear. We thought it would have been digitally updated but found it was not. We are sorry we purchased the CDs.D. Pritchard Arizona...""It is a shame that rural black artists of the 1920s and 30s could not record in 24-track studios with modern instruments to please the delicate ears of avid modern blues and jazz listeners...."
2,Mississippi Blues,We were anxious to receive the CDs as we are avid listeners of Blues and Jazz music. However were disappointed at the quality of the music. It was scratchy and difficult to hear. We thought it would have been digitally updated but found it was not. We are sorry we purchased the CDs.D. Pritchard Arizona
3,This Is ...,"Best known as the female lead on Phil Collin's ""Seperate Lives"", she made her own album in 1986 with one of my all time fav songs ""Night Moves"" and then two years later launched this, her second album. Starting with the single ""Possessive Love"" it's a dance rock number written for her by Madonna of all people. The song is fun, the music is fun and her voice can cut through glass. In fact it's her voice and not the whole 80s dance pop motiff that keep me putting this album on.There are some rocking tunes albeit they do have that synth drum behind them, but the minute ""Lay Me Down"" begins I'm hooked. The whole album is combined with great moody tracks and some earth shattering dance rock pop. The first album may stand up better in the 00s than this one, but that oh so 80s dance pop still has its place on my stereo... just ask my neighbors and their ever growing fear of Taylor Dayne."
5,Good product.,I am a quadriplegic with very little use of my hands. I have used one of these openers for at least ten years and it works very well for me.
5,"""Handy"" Helper","My 21 year old daughter has very bad arthritis and her hands are quite crippled. She struggles with all cans and bottles. I have a jar opener that works great but I still had to open soda cans for her. No more! I got 3 for her - 1 for her purse, 1 for the dorm and 1 for home. She is so happy to not have to get help anymore! They are very strong - I think you would really have to try to break them."
1,Does not last very long,I ordered this product from Wholesale LapTop Battery and paid extra for quick shipping. The item took over a week to arrive. I can only imagine how long regular shipping takes.The item worked as advertised for approximately two months and then began to work intermittently. At two and a half months it stopped working completely. This power supply was used in one location and was never moved.
5,Cheap OEM replacement for Dell laptop,"This charger was much cheaper than the original from Dell, but it works just fine. I got two of these, and am happy with them for now. Even if they last me for a year, I think it will be worth the money."
3,Diction must have,"I bought this book after using the manual for Italian diction. I would prefer that German and French were split into 2 books, but oh well. I would not be able to learn diction solely with this book because there is no aural portion. There is a very good chart for both languages. I would get a book that has a CD with it."
5,"Spirit Filled, soothing and beautiful","A friend shared a cd of Anakwad's with me and I wanted to find more recordings of his. I decided to try this one and it blew me away. The nature sounds are very clear, the music is wonderful and so are the vocals. I meditate with this as background sound and find it very soothing to sleep to."
2,Very American,"This book was a bit disappointing to me. I was looking for something with British and American phrases, and this is pretty strongly focused on the American. And some of those are good and interesting stories, but not as consistently odd and amusing as Britishisms.Others looking for just American phraseology will enjoy this, however."
1,No Zounds.,"This book was not funny at all. The definitions were filed with pop culture babble. Seemed like a nice idea, but, not funny."
4,The Berenstain Bears and The Blame Game,"In the Book called"" The Berenstain Bears and the blame Game"", there is a family of four, Brother Bear, Sister Bear, Mama Bear and Papa Bear. Mama Bear is usually friendly and kind, but now her house has turned into a never-ending blame game. "" Its her fault, No its his fault"", is what Brother and Sister Bear say. First they break a vase with roses that Mama Bear just put there that morning. Who knows what they will break next. This book teaches kids that fighting is no use. Instead of fighting they should get to work and solve the problem.I recommend this book for kids around 8.This book was good. I think you should get it for your kids, because it helps them with things that happen in the world."
4,Good book for preschoolers,Has a nice story line and teaches children not to blame each other for things. Also shows how to solve problems. The preschool kids really enjoy the Bernstein series.
5,great supplement to our lessons,We took some private lessons and also used this video to supplement. It gave us ideas of other steps to use in dancing and also gave us something to refer to when we were practicing at home.We showed it to our instructor and she liked it too.
2,Not as good as expected,Difficult EnglishNo explainations as to how to stand and move with style.Difficult to copy movements with dancers facing learner and one camera angle only.
5,A very useful tool,"This video is a very useful tool to use if you want to learn to dance argentine tango quickly and properly. The instruction starts with very simple lessons that teach basic rhythmic walking, tango embrace, and lead an follow concepts. I liked the close-up views that demonstrate how feet should move, in slow motion and also with music. Instruction is in English by Fabian Salas himself, which is great, since you are getting it from the master teacher, not through a translator or subtitles. The video ends with a demonstration dance that incorporates all the material learned in the ten lessons. A very elegant dance indeed. Of course, the two exhibitions at the start of the tape, taped in front of live audiences, are absolutely amazing, and show how much there is to the world of argentine tango. Five stars plus."
3,Won't replace lessons,A start on the road to learning. Can copy some routines to break the ice and not be too embarrassed.
3,Beware of other kinds of Tango,"Evidently, for those of you, like me, who didn't the difference - there is more than one kind of Tango... this is Argentine Tango and not the Ballroom Tango I was learning - no ""slow, slow, Tango closed"" but something entirely different and not at all useful for the style I was expecting."
1,STRAIGHT UP GARBAGE,"I have listened to the samples available on CD NOW. This album is straight garbage. Bizzy used to have the best flow. I am anxiously awaiting Krazy Bone New album.In this album, bizzy bone is too slow with his flow. The next thing you know he will probably have Lil Jon on his CD (no disrespect to lil jon) Don't count out Bone Thugs yet though, wait for Krazy Bone new release. Krazy Bone is the Real Backbone of Bone Thugs.For those looking for the quick flow, check out Twista, Do Or Die or if you want real underground.Former Three six Mafia affiliate, T-ROCK (Album Title Mr. Washington Theory)orTechn9nDo waste your money on this bizzy bone album, let some other sucka buy it, then burn it."
4,really good cd by one of the bone brothers,bizzy bone is my favorite in bone thugs~n~harmony but he really out did himself here he really hasn't lost his thug mentality. this cd really sounds good the production is good his lyrics and voice are really good. the only reason i don't give it a 5 stars is that some times in the chorus when he sings now i don't have a problem with some harmonys but on the songs he sings in the chorus his voice gets on my nerves. but other then that get this cd its really good but dont worry if you like the bone thugz then get this one you will enjoy it.o yeah and it come with a cool dvd witch follows bizzy bone he kicks some sick freesyles.
4,thats that bone,bizzy has steooed his game up in terms of lyrics but the production on this album sux I got it just because bizzy is my favorite member of bone thugs-n-harmony but Alpha & Omega does have its strong pointsMurdahI UnderstandNot AfraidDied 4 UBetter run Better HideEverywhere I gobottom line by the album from the lyrics not the beats
3,Bad Production,"I am a huge Bone fan and have been for a long time. Now i can admit that Bone has fallen off a bit in the past years. This CD was not as good as it could of been. Bizzy has grown in his flow and lyrics on this CD. however the production is not very good at all. it doesnt seem like there was much money put into this CD which is too bad cuz it could be great. with no guest appearances Bizzy holds his own throughout 14 songs and the stand out tracks are ""My Niggaz"", ""I Understand"", and ""We Play"". If your a Bone fan you will prbly like this so cop it."
1,So Sad!!!!!,"This is a very very very bad album that you should not buy!!! It is sad to to Bone Thugs falling apart like this and just straight up putting out trash these days. The only song I did like on this album was ""How We Play"". This song had the Bizzy Bone Style from his last album ""The Gift"", which is a very good album for being low budget and is so much better then Alpha & Omega. Now it just gets worse with the release of ""Bone Brothers"" with Layzie and Bizzy and this is a album you should really not buy!!!!! Layzie sucks and needs to give up rapping and Bizzy made himself look really stupid being on this album. If ""Bone Brothers"" were Bizzy and Krayzie then this album would of been off the hook!!! but oh well, just another bad album by Bone Thugs but I am already use to it!!!!"
3,This CD is a banger,I love Bizzy Bone he is a great rapper. I was woundering if anybody elses cd blankes out the swaerword on the last song. I Give a 3.5 Stars
2,Dam Bizzy,"Thw guy who reviewed it for HMV seemes to like it alot for sum reason,i however feel differently,lyrically it is not his best album his best album is The Gift,the beats r simple and the best song was edited.Bizzy ""Tha Kid"" sounds like hes freestyling in most of the songs,thats his new flow,on better run better hide,n sit back relax he rides em,but on the other songs it kinda sounds like hes freestyling,i kno bizzy can do better than this if you have heard his guest appearances this year on songs like Jim Jones-Twin Towers,Medasin Man-Side 2 Side and Hi Five-Run Da Club you will still have faith in Bizzy Bone,not this Tha Kid (O n BTW i havent bought this CD yet,its an import and will cost me 34.99,thats too much)"
3,Damn Bizzy,"O.K this is hard cause I've been a die hard fan of BTNH for a long time, Bizzy slipped with this album the quality in general is horrible. He does have some good lyrics but his style isn't that great, the best songs to me are ""I Understand"" and ""Better Run, Better Hide"" which has the best flow on the CD but is edited for some reason. An album for true BTNH fans but won't gain Bizzy any new fans, which is too bad cause I was looking forward to this after hearing him on ""Hollywood"" off the True Crime soundtrack which he was bangin'"
4,Good and Bad,"Lyrically, Bizzy has stepped his game up tremendously. This is a more personal album. Lyrics are great, flow is great, he did his part. What really hurt this album, is the production. There were a few good ones on here, but for the most part, the quality of the production was a couple steps down from ""The Gift"". However, Bizzy did enough to save the album from being a 2 or 3. DEFINITELY A ""MUST GET"" for Bone fans."
5,Bizzy Thanks,"This CD is on point and from the heart of a true man. Real recognize Real folks, this man truly put his life on CD for our entertainment. From the start bizzy paints a picture for his fans, yo and showed himself to be a bigger man by showing love to follow bone members. Yeah he may not be a mainstream rapper but it a diamond in the ruff. Thanks again Capo you saved me...."
5,Hail the KING OF BONE,This cd shows Bizzy's Tru Talent!!! It also shows how he's a true subject to the industry and went through what other rappers wish they went through. BTNH isn't a crew without Bizzy. Bizzy defines BONE!!!
5,bizzy keepin it real once again,"bizzy is the truth, at first this album might dissappoint you, but once you listen 2 it two or three times you'll b feelin it. Thats what happend with me, but when you are real Blazed u will feel it, I was gettin deeper into his lyrics, he'z spittin straight fire, a classical album from Bizzy repN the Bone Thugz the 2 the fullesttracks that are HOT:Not AfraidBetter Run, Better HideWe Play (HOT)MurdahGet this album quick,"
5,Does what its supposed to do,"When I connected my PC to my Receiver, I had a loud buzzing noise that continued even when music was not playing. After a number of hours of research, I found several web pages describing what happens when you have a ground loop caused by connecting multiple A/V devices into a reciever when the devices where plugged into different outlets. If all your electronics share an outlet, then this product won't help you, but if you have something like a PC in another room on a different outlet, this may cause a ground loop resulting in the buzzing noise. After I installed the isolator, the buzz was dead with no need to buy any additional equipment or a new PC soundcard. Worth every penny of is price. Oh, there are cheaper Isolators on the market, but be careful since some will negatively impact your sound (they are not made for Hi-Fi)."
3,Could make for an interesting play,"We are treated to eavesdropping on a cabal of fifth column industrialist leaders snickering over their misdeeds.So is this going to be a two dimensional sabotage movie where the good guys figure out whom the bad guys are just in time to save the bacon?No. This is more insidious. It looks like the cabal has another secret that will be detected and corrected, not out of patriotism but revenge.Can you guess the secret before it is played out?Bela Lugosi gets to make his signature light on his eyes signature look.Joan Barclay plays the love interest.Invisible Ghost ~ Bela Lugosi"
1,Not as informative as I'd hoped.,"Unfortunately, this book didn't help me at all. I wanted to find out how to aim my c-band dish using the technology available, but there was nothing of the sort in the booklet. Instead it contained information on where to place it, how to assemble it, etc. That information may be useful for some, but wasn't for me."
5,My best combination of fun and exercise,I'm having a ball! This is a great introduction to the art of belly dancing expecially for those of us intimidated by the idea of going to a class or simply don't have time. The step by step instruction gives beginners a chance to learn how to focus on the movement and how to reproduce it. It is also a great form of exercise. I'm gaining muscle tone (an unexpected plus)and also have a ball showing a select few my new dance moves. The DVD gives you an overview and the history of belly dancing and a performance by the DVD instructors. Join the fun!
2,Perhaps good for a stark beginner...,"It was a good video for the first couple times I worked with it, but since, it's become a bit repetitive and dull. Granted, I have some experience with belly dancing, and it was nice to see the basics described as being different movements than I learned them to be in my classes, but it just seemed far too easy. It did help me tone my muscles a little after my daughter was born, but I got far more of a workout from my other practices and lessons. In general, it'd be good for a beginner, but unless you really feel a strong tie to the spiritual side of the video, then you would be better choosing something more advanced."
5,Love Kathy,There is something about her singing that is just down right RIGHT! It is country the way I like it. Her voice soothes and touches the country part of my heart!
5,nothin beats fun,There is nothing better than the simple comedy of the old Dick Van Dyke show. The show itself is timeless and these dvds are crisp and clear. This is money well spent.
1,This DVD is of public domain episodes only,"Let me answer everyone's question as to why only these episodes were chosen....the producer of this DVD did NOT pay any royalties on these episodes!!! Due to an error many years ago, these episodes slipped into the public domain, as therefore, are being produced without any authorization or payment of royalites to the owners of the show.Let me tell you that each and every episode will be available in the next several months - created from original copies of the show for the highest quality...and they will be produced will the full knowledge of Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke.So, don't lose your sense of humor or your thumbs!! But keep an eye out for the entire collection of 158 shows sometime very soon."
2,"great show, poor copy","there's no question that The Dick Van Dyke Show will always be a landmark in Television Comedy. The stories and characters are as timeless today as when the show premiered 40 years ago. Our only complaint about this Canadian DVD is that the quality is not very good. It seems to be copied from 16mm prints, rather than the original film. It's also only 6 episodes. We have heard that the authorized anniversary edition of all 158 episodes is being released soon and it will be great to see DVD on DVD."
4,Great - But where's the rest!,"It's good to see DVD on DVD. The quality of this DVD is decent, however, I'm not sure how or why they chose the six episodes. ""The Night the Roof Fell In"" and ""Never Name a Duck"" are the two best on the DVD. I would have preferred more of the classic episodes such as Ghost of A. Chanz, or Coast to Coast Big Mouth. Looking forward to the entire 158 episode set to be released. In the mean time, this one will do!"
3,not as family friendly,"After thoroughly enjoying the first season of The Dick Van Dyke Show, I was disappointed to find that the 3rd season was not nearly as family-friendly. I found myself feeling uncomfortable watching some of the episodes and scenes with my children. I would not purchase this season again, even though there is still alot of great humor in it. It isn't worth it to have to constantly be editing out the inappropriate stuff."
1,Missing Disc's....DISC 5,"I ordered season's one and two, and season two was missing disc 5. They sent me another one, and it was missing disc 5 as well! No one is able/willing to help with this problem. I would hesitate to order season two, knowing there is a disc missing and Amazon is unwilling to replace it."
2,Buffering problems...,"I love old vintage tv, but my ipod kept bufffering every few minutes. You can't enjoy ANY show if it's constantly buffering."
3,"Skipping, ""Distortion"" on most disks","Tried two different copys so far, but in both, 3rd-5th pisodes on disks 3-5 suffered from varying degress of skipping, distortion, etc (episode 5 on disk 4 would not play at all, instead skipping to the beginning of the DVD). This is not at all related to the priginal quality of the episodes themselves (since it severity and location of the problems vary in different sets) but with a sloppy production process.The episodes themselves are very good, and this would receive a 5 star rating where it not for the skipping and other problems"
1,Not too thrilled,They didn't choose very good episodes for this DVD. It shows the episodes that are rather ho-hum. Many of the episodes of this great show were fantastic. But they didn't put them on here. So: ho-hum.
5,Great!,This set has some of the best shows on the Dick Van Dyke Show. We were so happy we were able to find them on Amazon!
5,It was on Wednesday nights at 9:30.,"I remember the day and time because it was the only night of the week my parents would let me stay up on a school night. You know it's funny, we all loved this clever, funny, original tour deforce cast and series. ou loved it then, you'll love it now. Owww Rob."
1,The Dick Van Dyke Show Season 5 Set,"The Lone Star is NOT for the show itself, which is fabulous. It's for Image Entertainment's lack of response to the defective DVDs in this set. I just purchased the 5th season (having bought the 4 previous sets with no problems) and so far Discs One and Two are defective. The episode titled ""Draw Me A Pear"" can't be watched at all. And the episode ""52,45, or Work"" cuts off half way through. I haven't watched the rest of the DVDs yet, but can only imagine what I have to look forward to.Has anyone out there purchased this set and been able to watch the whole thing without any trouble?"
5,Info on the extras,"Extras are planned for this release though not currently listed above. In addition to being uncut for the first time since their original broadcast (up to three whole minutes per episode being restored), the extras include:* Interview Segments with Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore* ""Mary Tyler Moore Remembers 'Bank Book 6565696'""* Joy Commercials* ""The Cast Remembers Jerry Paris""* ""Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam Remember Buddy and Sally""* 1963-1964 Emmy Awards Footage featuring David Jansen, the cast of The Beverly Hillbillies, Fred MacMurray and more!* ""The Making of 'It May Look like a Walnut!'""* ""Stump the Stars"" Program Excerpt with the Dick Van Dyke Cast* Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke Commentaries for 2 Episodes* Rose Marie, Ann Gilbert and Larry Matthews Commentaries* Still Galleries and Cast Bios"
3,Not bad,"This is a well written account of one woman's trip and love of Vietnam. At most times it flowed but there were times were I would see myself skipping over pages that didn't interest me. I was actually a little sad of her use of her male friend that she was with her first long stay in Vietnam. Makes me sad to think of her being American, I sure hope we all do not think of people as usable. At least you'd think she'd of said she was sorry. Besides that it was a nice read, nothing that blows you away but it's a good waste of a rainy day!"
5,The House on Dream Street,"I couldn't put this book down! This is not a common occurrence with me. I quite often don't finish books that I start. The last one that I read until all hours of the night was ""The Poisonwood Bible"". Aside from Ms. Sach's wonderful writing style, her Prologue pulled me in and the story never me let go. How I wish I could have been there with her."
2,disappointing,"In this second volume (and third part of the trilogy... a bit confusing this -very short- trilogy divided in two books) I missed nearly all the qualities of the first volume and found the flaws heightened.The storyline loses its pace and gets a little slow and boring, which is surprising enough if you reckon that this last part is essentially a manhunt, a subject that, if well done, should actually be breathtaking.Characters feel a little stereotyped, they declare their feelings for each other a little too loudly to be entirely believable.The overall impression is a sense of pedrantry, as if the intent in writing this last part of the story was to be didactic about homosexual relationships.The price is very high for such a short volume."
1,"Nope, Nope, Nope...","Book one of Stealing Some Time by Mr. Kendrick gives you the details of the setting of this book. You will be completely lost in Stealing Some Time book two if you have not read the first book.This book has more of the same of book one but the biggest difference is that Aaric and Kallen get to know each other more as Kallen spends some time in Aaric's 1800 world.Of course, Kallen is in pursuit by the powers that be (in his respective time and world) as they learn he stayed behind. They don't know why he did but the ball of yarn eventually unravels and everything comes out.Nothing, and I mean nothing, exciting happens in this book. Tons of dialogue between Aaric and Kallen and lots more tech stuff happens that slows the pace of the book out of warp speed to a crawl.Yawn."
5,Love it!,I ordered this fruit tower because I though it looked cool. It looks great in my kitchen and also is extremely functional. I use to have 2 baskets for my fruit but now I only need this 1 item and it rotates my fruit for me so that I know what needs to be eaten first. I love it and I am so glad I bought it!
5,Captivating,"I first noticed this book on the shelves of my local ABC (Adventist Book Centre)store. Since I love animals, I decided to pick it up. After reading the back I was a little worried because it was written long before my time. I am glad that I picked it up, and am eager to read the others (there are 12 vol. in the Living Forest Serries). Sam Cambell's style of writing puts you right in the heart of the story. I was actually sad when the book was finished. It is amazing the way he describes the surrondings and best of all the actions of the animals. He is a true animal lover. Highly recomended for all ages, young and old!"
2,Where are the recipes?,Most of the information was in his other books. I was looking for recipes not a rehash of his other factual writing. The few receipes included were not very exciting.
4,where oh where is it,I ordered this over a month ago and still do not have it was part of a gift to a friend and would like it.Hope you ave better luck
5,Outstanding performance for price,I've had HPs for years. Decided to try this after seeing some reviews. Performace is excellent. Networking easy to set up. I like the Paperport software. Can do quick scan and OCR from any of 6 workstations for up to limit of document feeder tray. Cost of purcahse and operation low. Also like separate drum & cartridge combo.Dan B
2,May be okay for some projects,"This disk has a reasonably good selection of fruits and vegetables, and random household/office items, but beyond that, it's not too impressive. The lack of animals (aside from insects and one taxidermy duck) and vehicles is particularly disappointing.The images are all fairly low-resolution (no more than 500 pixels on their longer dimension). Also, these images do not have transparent backgrounds -- all of the images are in JPG format with white backgrounds. I'm not sure what the ""Work with multiple vector-based clipping paths"" part of the product description is referring to -- there do not seem be any clipping paths associated with the images on the disk.Overall, I think it's worth the $1.74 I paid for it, but it's not worth much more than that."
4,Fun.,"I do image-editing more as a hobby and to make my ""blog"" more annoying than other people's, so my needs are not as extraordinary as other people. I found this fun little disc in the discount bin, and I'm quite satisfied, especially with the very, very attractive brunette woman who appears in so many of the photos. It works well with the ""smart select"" function in my ""Nova Photo Explosion"" program, so for my limited purposes, this is a great buy."
5,WHERE LEGENDS START...,"This castle is not just beautiful but durable and sturdy. My 4 yr old son received it for Xmas and it has been the best present ever. My husband and I LOVE playing with it. It's like owning our own fantasy land...and given the fact that children learn the most by active play, the educational value of it has no limits. Imagination is all it takes... and some assembly, as well! :) Buy it and you will not regret it. It is a toy that will last forever. Hopefully it will become, someday, my grandkids favourite, too!"
2,v tech learning system,"Although my 4 year old enjoys the games and originally bought this for my first son at 5 years, there was some sort of short with the cord and game. If they move when playing the game, it shuts off. I tried to return it to Target, but, it was over the time period for their return policy. I do not have confidence in buying this system or other products made by v tech."
3,Vtech,"This is great for going on trips however, the batteries do not last very long. My son likes playing it better hooked up to the television. Also when this arrived to us from this seller it was marked as ""new"" however, it had been opened."
1,Vtechs customer service stinks,We bought this toy in October O8 for my grandson for Christmas. I took it out to put batteries in it and it blue screened. It did not work at all. So I went through the trouble shooting and then called Vtech on December 9 08. They said they would send a call tag to pick up the game and when they get it back they will ship me a new one. Well today is the 16th and still no call tag. I called again today because there is no way a new one will be here by Christmas if I have to wait for them to get me a tag and wait for it to get to them before they ship UPS ground for Christmas. It's their policy they keep saying. Then I asked to talk with the supervisor and was told the Sup would call me at 5:30 central time today. No such call happened. I am fed up with this company and will no longer buy their products.
1,Hope you can afford to replace it every 6 months,"I have had to replace my sons darn thing every 6 months. And the home version about also. I say about because the first one lasted 4 months and the second one 8. So the average is six. He is not a toy destroyer either. He has a Nintendo DS and a Playstation 2. Both of them for years, and they aren't even designed for kids. I just like thse because he learns playing them, so he's limited on his PS2 and DS. I really like the concept but the quality really sucks. Now his Vflash, the new one from Vtech, died yesterday after we just bought him two more games for christmas. And their customer support really sucks so."
2,Do not buy it!,My daughter got it for Christmas last year. It broke in two & half month. Such a waist!:-((((((
1,JUNK!!!,"I have purchased 6 vsmile, and/or vsmile cyberpockets and all of them have stopped working shortly after purchase. I have tried using only batteries, only the 9volt plug in, and still the system shuts down, and never powers up again. So disappointing. I have 10 games that are useless to my kids, because the machines are junk. Don't waste your money."
1,don't buy it,"Don't buy this toy, it will turn on, but won't play any of the games, makes my son very upset. I hear the leapster works better"
3,VSmile hand held,"My son just loves this game system. It is however not without its flaws. It hardly works when operated by battery. It occassionally works when plugged into the wall at home. Surprisingly it always works in the car with the car charger. He has endless fun while driving in the car, but the fun ends when we reach our destination. I am going to invest in different types of batteries to see if this elevates the problem. We have the pocket system and the home system and it is a shame that there are so many kinks with them because they are a great learning tool for children."
5,BEST MONEY SPENT!!!,"If you are looking for something for little ones to use THIS IS IT!!! My husband and i use to play with the first one all the time. My first son had it from the time he was 2 until he was 7!! IT STILL WORKS, bought this one for my 4 year old for Christmas cause Im tired of them fighting over 1. Well worth every penny!!!"
4,I'm surprised at all the negative reviews!!!,"I actually got on here to research the cyber pocket, thinking I'm going to upgrade to that for Christmas for my 6 year old & most reviews say not to buy it, so I thought I'd check out what people are saying about this. We are military & I purchased this used 2 years ago at a base-wide children's consignment sale for $20 with a few games. It did have a small scratch on the front, but didn't effect use and in 2 years my son hasn't added any more. I have been faced with it shutting off or not wanting to power on, which is annoying, but not enough to make me regret buying it. My son loves it and it's a video game I don't mind him playing! We make road trips all the time back to see our family (mine is 7hrs away and my husband's is 13), I don't know what we'd do without this!"
4,Great toy for ages 2-5...we've had ours for two kids,"We bought this when my oldest daughter (now almost 7 years old) was 3. She actually had the video game console version first and then we bought the pocket system since it was portable. My second daughter often wanted to play it but didn't quite understand (she's 2 1/2 now) but around Christmas, she was able to play it (after getting a V-Motion for Christmas, which can also play these games). I love that I can use the same games on three different gaming systems. And, we've had ours for over three years of PLENTY of dropping! My eldest got a Nintendo DS for Christmas; this is nothing like that (and the only thing I don't like is that there is no pen...but I think my almost 3 year old would not be able to use the redesigned Pocket that has a tethered pen since it's not used on the actual screen). Anyway, great toy, very durable, though sounds like others have had a bad one in the mix."
4,"Good, so far","As a previous owner of a Vtech Smile system, I was leery about buying another one. The first system broke within 6 mos. of ownership. Even though numerous reviewers complained of the same problems with the pocket system as I had with the original system, I thought I'd take a chance, afterall, I had already invested in 5 game cartridges from the first system. To my horror, the game stopped working on Christmas night, after only a couple hours of play. I tried hooking it up the AC adaptor and still, nothing. I got out my paperwork as prepared for battle with the Vtech people. Just for the heck of it, I replaced the enclosed batteries, and it's worked fine ever since, even the adaptor, and the AV jacks that allow me to plug it into the TV. I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
4,"Lots of Fun, scratches easily","This toy has been a life saver for long trips, doctor's office visits, boring trips to the grocery store, but you should know the screen scratches really easily. Also, the cases hold so few games. we have probably 12 or 13 games, all wonderful for teaching, but you can only get two or three in the carrying cases. that being said, my son loves this game, and it beats the heck out of the mindless video games that are the beginning of brain death. cute and educational, just wish the darned thing didn't get scratched so easily."
4,V.smile pocket,"We love this toy, however, this is our second one due to it not always working the way it should. It seems you have to use the ""reset"" button an awful lot. I think the concept of the game is great and the fact that you can use it in the car or hook it to your t.v. is wonderful. It is a great toy and our children really enjoy using it."
4,"Sure, Come Out With This After V-Smile...","Yes, my son has the V-Smile and like 6 games. Yes, he loves it - plays it every day. Yes, it's actually teaching him things.So why am I irked that I'm buying him the Pocket version? BECAUSE, the Pocket can also be used on the T.V., so basically I paid for that feature twice: once for the original, once for the Pocket. You just KNOW they had the design and product ready before the started selling the original unit, so I just feel a bit [...]. Whatever.This is not stopping me from buying the Pocket unit, mainly because it's so darn useful for trips and visits and all that. Truth to tell, he gets sick of DVDs after a while, and no amount of songs on an iPod will keep him interested. But these games do, so...One thing: vTech, you had best keep the games coming for at least 3 more years (when he'll most likely upgrade to a DS like his mother), or you'll be hearing from me.jdk"
1,Terrible. . .,"I purchased this as a Xmas gift for my 3 y.o. It is already broken. She didn't do anything unusual, it just stopped. I also bought the charging dock, and that could be part of the problem. All I know is that it is sitting in a closet not working and it wasn't cheap. I would not recommend this at all."
2,"Great Concept, Great Games , Poor Quality","I loved the concept of this toy, Teaching with games. But I bought both the v-smile and the v-smile pocket and have been disappointed. The quality of this toy is really bad. It lasted a few hours before turning off on its own. The home version of the system was a bit more resilient. It lasted a few months. Now I have to click on the ""on"" button a few dozen times before it works. The pocket version is just plain bad. I have had a lot of trouble getting it to work with batteries. I works better with the 9v wall adapter, unless you move a little then it resets itself. I bought my daughter a leapster for Christmas. Hopefully that one works better. Will post later on that one."
2,Poor quality. Needs to last more than a year with normal use.,"I've gone through at least 3 or 4 Vsmiles in the past 2 years. After normal use, the systems start having glitches and stop working. I thought it was just my kids, because they love their vtech and leapsters. (BYW not one leapster has broken yet). I've come to the conclusion that if you have a vpocket and your kids like playing with it, you should expect it to die very soon. I considered buying the cyber pocket but the reviews on that are worse...their newer model. Also the AC adapters for the vpocket don't work with the games!! so I had to constantly put in batteries. If I want them to play with their many games I've bought them ,,,,I'd have to keep buying their handheld systems every few months...no one likes being loaded with a money pit."
3,VERY EDUCATIONAL GAME BUT NOT VERY DURABLE,Our kids loved playing the V-Smile Pocket. Most of the games are great because they teach while they play. However we constantly had problems with this system. The power cord is cheaply made and a couple tugs on it caused it to short out. We purchased a replacement power cord for it and about a month later it done the same thing. So we figured we would simply use batteries in it and we did for a while and then one day it just wouldn't even turn on at all with a cord or batteries.
3,product not durable,We have four children and we have been through 2 console systems and 3 hand helds. The product is cute and games are fun but the consoles and the handhelds tear up so easily. It is not worth the money I've spent on all of the products. Now we are stuck with 10 games. Don't want to spend the money again...
4,A good example of determination and self-confidence.,"I have seen this movie several times, an all time favorite. Three young girls wanting more out of life than what life seems to be offering. The famous line ""Keep Your Head Up, Shoulders Back and Don't Forget to Smile"" can prove to the world that with a bit of gumshun we all can make it and life's little ups and down won't keep us down forever. The World of Ziegfield is shown with beautiful songs, stage productions and Glamourous girls. The likes we will never see again in the movies."
4,Great Musical,"I watched this movie over the weekend and fell in love with it. Hedy Lamarr, Lana Turner, and the great Judy Garland light up the screen. The lavish musical numbers, georgeous costumes, and old Hollywood glamour make this a ""can't miss"" event."
2,1940's musical,"We laughed ourselves silly over the outrageous costumes. If this was what busby berkley was famous for, help us all. Even given the year it was made it is comedic. Hedy Lammar looks sinster, Judy Garland looks up usual pilled up self. Lana Turners tried her dramatic skills which are non existent. I'm reminded of a quote from Bea Arthur ""There will never be a generation as naive as we were"""
1,Blank book,"This is certainly not what I thought it was. Nowhere is it mentioned that this is a blank book. ""She Read the Letter...Journal (Paperback)"" does NOT indicate a blank book. I see the comments made indicate that other people were mislead. The entire product description is misleading: talks about the author and various comics, leading one to believe this is a collection of stories. ""...Journal"" appears to be part of the title. If one does not buy blank books called ""journals"" there is no way to know that this is blank. A very misleading product description. Most such actual ""journals"" are hardbacks anyway, so this appears to be an intentionally misleading product."
1,Not Worth It,"As mentioned in the prior customer review, but not in the product description, this is basically a piece of merchandise, not a book - or really any kind of creative effort.Blank pages with a nice cover and some tiny retread illustrations at the margins of some pages.Not a worthy effort by Tomine, and not a worthy investment for a fan.Why bother?"
3,A delight,"A smart, good-hearted story that is a delight to read even centuries later. Fielding knew what he was doing, which I find slightly astonishing in that he was essentially inventing the novel form as he went. Characters are well drawn and engaging, dialogue is snappy and realistic, and the pacing is a tour de force despite the necessarily episodic nature of the plot. Three and a half stars."
4,Very interesting,"This is a very interesting history and current status report on the people of Sapelo Island, Georgia. The writing is a bit spotty and it should have had better editing, nonetheless, interesting and informative."
5,The People,"If interested in island folks and cultures read this book. I have waited until my retirement days to become interested in the geographics that surrounds my homeland. Georgia is full of history, but Savannah is current day by day history. The surrounding coastal islands are so interesting and the people who lived there are even more interesting. I am starting a libray of literature on Georgia histroy I will never be bored. Try It."
5,S.O.S need the CD,This is film is fab!Its an absolute classic and ive been searching everywher for the soundtrack on C.D! so if anyone knows please it will make me v.v. happy
5,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins ' Medical Assisting Exam Review for CMA and RMA Certification,This book is an excellent review and study guide for the Exam. I would HIGHLY! recommend this book to anyone who is preparing to take the review.
5,Best preparation for exam,"I used this book and the attached CD to prepare for my exam. I passed with a 93% out of 100. The book gives examples that are exactly like the exam questions. If you study this book thoroughly, you are guaranteed success."
3,use this only it you have a medical background,"This book is helpful, but unless you have a medical background, I would study the class workbooks along with this one. That being said, I did pass. I have been in the field for some years though."
5,EXCELLENT,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO TAKE THE CERTIFATCATION FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCES IT HAS ALOT OF GOOD INFOIRMATION NEEDED
2,Not That Much Help,"Didn't really help with AAMA CMA exam. Did better by reviewing my school text and the study guides and CDs with it. Guess it didn't hurt to have an extra study aid, but cannot say this book really raised my score or made a difference."
5,Cool,The item arrive quickly. I have read many reviews on how students passed using this study guide. We will see....
4,complete coverage,"I ordered this book to prepare for the CMA exam and am happy to say I passed it! This book is concise and covers every area of study in the medical assistant's job position. I enjoyed the book's sample tests at the end of each chapter, at the end of the book, and on the cd-rom. Super fun way to go over what can be rigorous material. Beautifully done!"
4,Passed RMA test on first attempt!,"I used this older version of the book to take the RMA test today. I passed with a 95. I took my medical assisting classes two years ago and have only worked as a phlebotomist...not medical assistant. I spent maybe 15 hours studying with this book and going over old flashcards from class. If you are taking the RMA exam, you don't need the section on radiology. But do study the exam positions, accounting portions, medical terminology...and there are pictures of surgical instruments on the test so don't forget to study those. Also there were a lot of questions about first aid...you may have to find a textbook for that. Study medical terminology and anatomy and physiology. You need to have studied medical assisting front office and back office. This book covers both and was very helpful for refreshing the information in my brain."
4,Medical Assisting Exam Review,"I passed my CMA. This book is good for reference, but not passing the exam. CMA has a higher standard."
2,Disappointed with book,"I agree with another person sharing their thoughts about studying this for the AAMA(MA) exam. It did not really help. I passed the exam, but not because of the book. I think AAMA exam carries higher standards and asked far more information than the book covered. I was very disappointed. I guess for general knowledge the book is pretty good, but not if your taking the AAMA (MA) exam"
5,Excellent Quality,"This product was in excellent shape, I will be using this book to study for me Certification for Medical Assisting. In our class we have the book online, but, I perfer hard copies. I already told my classmates about the book and some will be purchasing the book also from Amazon."
1,thought this book would help,But eventually did not i study everything and thought I had enough information to pass my AAMA exam. Turn out I failed not miserably but was very disapointed. The AAMA exam was so different since they changed to 200 hundred questions a lot of administrative information and questions just totally never even thought they would ask. So for now I will find an up to date AAMA review book to help but this is good information but not for the board exam.
2,Harry's Cafe service review,This book was advertised as new. It was not new and could not be returned because the CD was missing.I contacted them and received a couteous but unhelpful apology. No offer of any part of a refund.I will not order from them again.
2,Kind of boring,"I never could understand what people saw in NRBQ. While they are individually excellent musicians, as a band, they bored me to death. As an avid fan of the original Wild Weeds and a fan of Al Anderson's guitar playing and soul music compositions, it was disappointing to see him change the Weeds into a country band, relegating the incredible bass player Bob Dudek to playing boring drum parts and giving the fantastic B3 master Ray Zeiner good reason to leave the group. At least NRBQ was more interesting than what the Weeds turned into, but not much more."
1,Waste of Money,"This box set was terrible. It included two DVDs, Punk Poets and Up Close and Personal. Punk Poets was decent. It had a few interviews with people that knew Blink before they became famous. Up Close and Personal was the worst documentary I've ever seen. On the cover of the DVD is Blink and what they look like now. On the DVD, the most recent footage of them is from the late 90's during Dude Ranch, and they keep playing the same footage over and over again. They also interview a random porn star that was in a movie with Janine, who was the woman on the cover of Enema of the State. She says she likes Blink once and then flashes the camera the rest of the time. Also the ""host"" of the DVD is unprofessional, and you can tell he knows nothing about Blink. He calls their hit song, ""What's My Age"". I would not recommend this to anyone. I would recommend buying punk poets separately or watching it on Amazon Instant Video. It was defiantly not worth 20 dollars."
1,Worst documentery in history,"I'm a huge Blink fan so when I saw this Documentary I was stoked and thought even if it's not that great it will still be worth it. Well it was the worst piece of trash I've ever laid eyes on. No Blink music, the same b-roll shots over and over and over and over and over. I'm pissed that I spent money on this but I'm more pissed that I actually wasted an hour of my life that I can never get back. It had about 10 seconds of actual band interview footage. The production was a disgrace. This is someone trying to capitalize on somebody's success. Very sad."
1,Disgusted,This product is not at all what it seems it will be when you order it. It has no music from the band and is full of almost pornographic like images. The quality is awful. I sent it back immediately. The fact that this is even being sold without a rating or warning about the nudity is very offensive. I wish I did not even have to give this one star. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY PURCHASING THIS!
4,It wasnt enough information.,"It needed more information. It was very interesting but not enough to learn more about my kitten. I needed to learn how to train her while she is young. I am looking for a book that talks about outside cat. My kitten, Ashley,cant come in the house when she wants to..I have to let her in. I want to know if it is alright to have an outside kitten. If it is dangerous or not. Cat Care was a good book but not enough.It was at a price I culd offord and it answered almost all my questions. If you have a indoor cat/kitten then I recommend this book to you. Thank You.Jessica"
2,Nice little movie,I loved this movie when I was a kid and was pleasantly surprised when I saw it on video. Not quite an enthralled with it now but it was a nice jog down memory lane. Patty Duke is always good in my book.
2,From Billie to A Chorus Line,"Patty Duke fans and nostalgia buffs will enjoy Billie; others not so much. But fans of the musical A Chorus Line can see some ACL alums honing their skills here. Donna McKechnie is lead dancer in ""The Beat"" musical sequence (she's in the red and white striped blouse) which is a nice featured part. Clive Clerk is also in that sequence (boy in the white shirt with grey slacks), but unfortunately the pan-and-scan cuts him off a lot because he is on the side. He also gets to start the ""A Girl is a Girl"" number in the locker room and he gets lots of bits in that number."
2,"Campy 60's teen flick, wrong aspect ratio","This is a good cheesy 60's teen movie. I always liked this film, but it's too bad they released it in pan and scan. It makes the film look badly edited. I had the pan and scan VHS version years ago. When they released ""Billie"" on laser disc in letterbox several years ago I purchased the LD and the movie looks so much better.THEY SHOULD HAVE RELEASED THIS FILM IN IT'S ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO OF 2.35:1. I won't buy it until they do!"
4,The beat,The movie with the beat has stuck in my head since young. I wanted to go back and visit in this era. A new time. A patty duke fan still.
3,Just Fair,Not up to Last's standard as compared to his CDs. Music selection not very good and all the physical gyrations by Last and the performers did not help anything.
5,"A quirky, unusual, and thoroughly entertaining novel","I enjoyed this book. Karen Joy Fowler has written a novel that marks out a genre all its own, as it is not quite an ""historical novel,"" not quite science fiction, not quite feminist fiction, and not quite fantasy. It succeeds in being imaginative, politically astute, and historically informative, however, as Ms. Fowler uses the events of the story as a vehicle for including endless anecdotes, ""fun facts,"" and asides that reveal her vast and intricate knowledge of U.S. political and social history. There's even a plethora of ""homemaker tips"" included, for good measure. The plot is not the point here; in this novel, the ""journey is the reward,"" as each and every page includes verbal gems and incisive bits of social commentary and are endlessly engrossing and enlightening."
4,Charming and Enjoyable!,A great summer book. The author does a great job capturing a time period that occurred 20 years before I was born. She throws in some interesting twists and I was pleasantly suprised by the subtle humor.
4,"Ironic, affectionate, knowing, a delight.","Karen Joy Fowler's marvelous first novel, Sarah Canary, whetted my appetite for more, and this is a worthy successor. Set in Magrit, Minnesota, in 1947, it is the story of the young women of this town with almost no men. They work in the research kitchen of the town's breakfast cereal company, they play baseball for a barnstorming baseball team, they write kitchen/life advice for ""housewifes"", they search for love and/or husbands: all these elements, and Fowler's narrative voice, ironic, affectionate, and knowing, combine in an always entertaining story, full of truth about women's place in society, then and now"
4,I was out of breath!,"I've done P90X, P90X2, Insanity, Insanity: Asylum, and TurboFire this is one tough workout! By 10-15 minutes into it I wanted to die! I cringe everytime I put this DVD in. The only thing I don't like about it is that you do the same Tabata drill 8x in a row. You have 8 cardio drills, you do each of those drills 8 times for 20 seconds and then rest/recovery for 10 seconds. I reccomend this to anyone! This video provides 3 different levels of intensity. I switch back and forth between level 2 and level 3."
4,She is an butt kicker!!,Awesome DVD! I can't wait to work up to the modified exercises..My lower body was super sore the next day
3,"intense workout but,","As another reviewer posted, I too found it somewhat boring. I do like that it offers three various methods for doing the routine so that it can be adjusted to your own level of challenge. I tried this DVD three times but it did not interest me enough to want to do it again. Not to mention, after the first time I used the DVD I began to encounter issues with it stopping a few times midway through some of the exercises. My DVD player works fine and so do my other DVDs; not going to bother to send it back."
2,Just Plain BORING,"I like Amy D. I have 2 of her other DVDs and I like them. I think she's knowledgeable with a great personality. In spite of that, I found this workout to be very boring. I mean, I was dripping in sweat but I just couldn't see myself reaching for it again and again. It has the dread factor. I don't know how else to explain it...maybe if this were a live class that I attended it would be more exciting but on the DVD it was just boring. I'm glad many others liked it...just wasn't my cup of joe."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"As someone who works out 4-5 times a week, mostly doing bootcamps, interval training, etc....this tape really took me by surprise!! Not even halfway through the tape, I was sweating uncontrollably and huffing/puffing like crazy...which I was happy to find. Her moves range from beginner -intermediate-advanced..but all with give you a great workout. I still have not gone through the entire tape without taking a break (longer than the short 10 second breaks she gives you between sets)...which gives me a goal to look foward to. Anyone looking for an exceptional cardio workout should definitely purchase this tape!! I have Breathless Body 2 on its way ;)"
4,Breathless is right!,"I would give it 5, but haven't really seen the desired results (which means I haven't gotten to level 3 yet). Amy is a powerhouse and at level 2, she keeps you in the game and motivated! The countdown really does work (it's a mental game for sure) and I like to switch between levels (but am steady at level 2)."
4,skip in product but workout is great,"Tabata workout that really is great. The only problem is with the tape, it has a defect for just a few seconds it skips. I don't want to send it back though because I use the workout 2 x's per week."
3,Cute kids book,"Got this for my kids, cute idea, but wish I'd spent my $$ on real photos instead. But gives them a little slice of Rome life."
3,This is Rome,"Great for the kids -- simply written with uncomplicated illustrations. This classic notes many of the city's most recognized attractions, and during our visit, my kids recalled many of them from the book."
5,"Fabulous ""find"" just sitting there under our noses to discover","This BBC series has been around for little while and has a great reputation. Yet, I still found my jaw dropping at some of the shots. It is very satisfying and doesn't feel like it could be done any better.As for watching with kids, I agree with the other reviewers. I was glad not to have the usual, ""this beautiful X loves its young, but predator Y is always just around the corner..."" just before something terrible happens. There is no need to subject young children to shocks like that, so I applaud the series for this tasteful choice as well."
5,Gorgous and interesting,"I love this DVD package. I first watched it on tv and was in awe. Had to have these DVD's. Now I have a LCD tv, and they are even better. So much more interesting that animal films done years ago, now the photography is supurb and the story telling is more interesting. It keeps your eyes and ears focused on the tv."
4,uh...,"It took over a month to receive this item. I never got a notification that it was either on back-order or just plain wasn't sent out, but it was a gift for someone ordered weeks in advance specifically for time delay, but it still was not shipped to me on time, even though i PAID for speedy shipping.Never again."
5,The best there is,"I used to write Amazon reviews for every video I saw. I recently stopped doing that because they are unappreciated. My reviews are very sharp and informative, and then some lunkheads give them the ""thumbs down"" and I realize I'm writing to unappreciative morons. So I stopped. I just wanted to go on record saying that. And by the way, the David Attenborough series of nature films is amazing, and anyone who gives this series less than five stars is an ingrate with no taste. This right here is the best of the best."
2,Incredible cinematography and arrogant ignorance!,"If David Attenborough kept his mouth shut, I would give him 5 stars. If he only spoke of what he observed: 5 stars. The films are amazing! Just hit your MUTE button, unless you believe an explosion of nothing could produce such awesome order. This requires more faith than Christianity. David is as motivated to insert his religion of evolution as he is to comment on what he can observe and duplicate. DAVID ... THERE'S A GOD IN HEAVEN WHO CREATED ALL THINGS FOR HIS PLEASURE!Psalm 14:1"
5,Amazing!,"Unless you base your life on a literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible, then there's nothing here that will bother you. So, don't let the warnings of the fundamentalist fringe scare you off.If, however, you like nature and animals and have accepted some modern ideas then this is a great series. Beautiful images and Sir David's always-engaging commentary make this a fun and educational experience."
5,blindspot is off the hizzie fo shizzie,"This was a great book by a great author who i believe we will see alot from in the future. His best quality is he is very descriptive. I felt like i was seeing exactly what he was seeing when he was writing the book. Storys range from around 2 pages to about 30 pages giving you a tons of different things to read about, its alot of twilight zone type material which i love (as should everyone else). Not only is the author an awesome guy but he is also a very talented writer. A MUST HAVE!p.s. the pages were soft on my bumbum"
2,Now I've lost everything I had in you...,"Geoff still has his velvet voice, but there's just no heart in these vocals; quite uninspired. Hard-hitting instrumentals, but after a few songs, it becomes musical wallpaper blending in to itself over and over; lack-lustre. I'm a huge Queensryche fan and am very disappointed in this offering. I'm sure others may like it, and that's cool as we're all entitled to like what we like, but for me, the interest that spanned the first Mindcrime is not here in this one. And, without Chris (as in the last few albums), you don't get that signature Queensryche sound. Sorry guys, I love ya, but you blew it on this one."
1,Are you 4 star reviewers high ? This album sucked !!,"Queensryche have molested the legacy of their masterpiece, Operation Mindcrime, with this lame release. Specifically, Tate's vocals are an overbearing presence throughout the tracks, effectively nulling the low keyed guitar riffs. Truely resonant guitar riffs are virtually nonexistant. Overall, the tempo is disjointed and wandering. A very disappointing release from the once great band from Bellevue. Only the diehard, O.C.D. afflicted Queensryche fan will have no regrets having paid good money for this dud."
1,pure shit,What has happened to Queensryche? Ever since Empire it has been a downhill ride for this band.
2,Regarding Tate's voice complaints,"I went to high-school with these guys. I had their brothers and sisters in some of my classes back in Bellevue, Wash. Remember, in 1983 with their first EP on vinyl, Goeff Tate was 26 years old. That puts him at 49 or so today. He makes up for ANY percieved vocal inconsistancies with lyrical content and passion. I don't really like O:MII at all and actually won't even buy it, too bad. It's easy to see DeGarmo's influence missing. But their ""Tribe"" disk is some excellent introspect. The original O/M is spactacular, along with Empire and the like.I've never heard Prom-land all the way through though... Tate's got some of his best stuff on his self-titled solo disk. Hope he does another one soon, I'll definitely buy that one unheard."
2,"I wanted to like this, I had high hopes, but....","...Operation Mindcrime II just isn't something to get excited about. I really like Queensryche. They are one of my top 15 bands of all time. I have all their studio CD's, but after more than a few listens, my greatest disappointment comes from the fact that for a concept album, the story just isn't evident! Like many other reviewers, I wasn't expecting OMII to mimic it's predecessor. But I did expect some energy and excitement and most of all, a story. Those qualities don't show themselves on this effort. If you are already a fan of Queensryche, then this CD is necessary for your collection. Like me, you probably will listen to it occasionally for songs like Rearrange-You and Chase. I still like Queenryche, but this one is not one of their better ones."
1,Put down the Kool Aid,"I've been hearing it for more than 18 years. How great Queensryche is. Stop already. Please. Pretty please. With sugar on top. Shut the f**k up.Know how many rock critics/experts like the 'Ryche? Approximately none. Know how many ""best albums of the last 25/30/35/40 years"" lists Mindcrime made? None. Not Rolling Stone's, not Spin's, not NME's, not nobody's. Why? 'Cause it's not very good.""F**k you, man! You just don't get it!"" Right. That's what the Emporer's tailor told the townspeople about his new clothes. Critics who have been listening to and writing about rock 'n' roll for decades don't ""get it"" either, I guess. They get ""Sticky Fingers,"" they get ""Abbey Road,"" they get ""OK Computer"" -- but ""Operation: Mindcrime"" somehow eludes them.You know what's funnier than watching 150 dorks stumbling out of a Mindcrime laser light show, all pumped up and talking to each other about how awesome it was? Nothing."
1,DRM'd?,"Anyone else having problems listening to this on a computer? My iMac G5 refused to even acknowledge this disc when I popped it in. Haven't seen anything to indicate this is DRM'd, but it sure seems like it to me."
4,Just stick with this style..,"People...We already knew it could never match MC I, one of the best CDs ever. MC II stands on it's own merit. The story is deep, if not a little slow at the start. They did a nice job of returning to the 80's sounding guitars and the solos are pretty good. This album is much more cohesive when listened to start to finish and will grow on you. The bass and drums are tight and Mary is back on a few tracks. Good stuff. Nice comeback by QR. BTW, I like the original theme and cover art and I'm glad they didn't change it.When I'm suffocating..It gives me air. Most QR fans will like this release."
3,Ok Cd,"I am a huge fan of the reich, and I decided to save some money and have my best friend burn me this CD. Listened to it for the first time and didn't think it was as good as the First Mindcrime. Not as heavy, but Okay, i guess. Tracks like One Foot Hell and I'm American were ok, but overall, i still do reccomend this album for any Queensryche rocker. Rock on!"
2,Music Review,"As expected, not nearly as good as the first. Some songs are just flat out awful. Whatever, I'm a Queensryche fan so I still bought it.At least they went back to their older style of music with this album instead of the progressive stuff they had been putting out."
3,It's good...,"OK, if you think this is going to blow your doors off like the original ""Mindcrime"" did when you were in high school... think again. Having said that, this IS a good solid rock album. Much better than most of the crud on the market today. And, if you are a Queensryche fan, this is a must buy. It tells the end of the story you've speculated on for so long.Plus, if you can get past ""Hands"" without clicking back to hear the track again because you don't want it to end, you don't like rock music. Now THAT is a darn fine track. I was fortunate enough to be in a limited audience (20 people) when they did an accoustic version of this song. Magical.Listen and enjoy. Your world won't end if you don't buy this album... but your ""old school"" CD collection will thank you for it."
5,Awesome,This is the Queensryche album everyone has been waiting for since Promised Land. The Ryche is back in top form with this album.
2,not bad but....,this pales in comparison to the first one. Perhaps it is time for the band to go down a new path and forget about sequels.The overall atmosphere is less enthralling and I was expecting so much more from this talented band.
3,It's not often that I'm this surprised...,"As I listened to this, I realized that I wanted to (and expected to) dislike it SO much . . . yet I just couldn't. I really didn't think that the guys had it in 'em.I was wrong. The more I listened, the more I just could not deny the fact of how good this recording was.The fact of it being Operation: Mindcrime II initially sparked my interest--and was probably the only reason I really even looked into the recording (as I haven't cared for much of anything they've done since the original Mindcrime). But, honestly, even without the continuation of the concept, I would still consider this as being a truly well done record.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who once loved this band, but got tired of hearing their music getting more and more watered down. This is a good one . . . finally.ADDITION 1-30-13: And now I hear that most of Queensryche didn't even really play on this one. Totally soils the experience. Reducing the start. Sad."
2,Yawn,"If you are looking for a flashback to the Queensryche of the first Mindcrime, don't buy this album. Tates vocals were uninspired and lacked the range The songs didn't flow together as they did in the first album. Rockenfields percussion was also unimpressive (and I have great respect for him as a fellow percussionist). It seems like he phoned it in. What happened to the driving rhythms of the first Mindcrime? A diffent guitarist and producer also made for a different sound and feel to the album.I realize this isn't 1987, and things change. But if you're hyping a sequel album you should sick to the formula of the first. I'm selling my album in the used section if you're looking to buy."
4,you have to give it time!,"I am a long time fan of course, since 83 to be exact. I figured this album would be strong, which it is. The thing about this album is, you have to listen to it a few times and really let it sink in. We have all had albums like that, some get you right at first, and some take a few listens. OM2 is that way, the album really has some good song writing, contrary to some reviews I have read, again, give it time and you'll find that this is really a great record."
5,Brilliant Cd!!!,"As an ""old""(42) and jaded metal guy,it's VERY rare that I can put on an album(Cd)and literally get chills.This album did,from start to finish.Unlike some other reviews,I was hooked from note #1.The story,the music,the vocals...everything.If I had one complaint,it would be that the album closes on a slow note and I prefer a more powerful closing track.But given the story,the album closer is more than appropriate.I first saw Queensryche in 1983(!)opening for Twisted Sister in a bar in Buffalo NY and have their first ep on 206 records,so obviously I'm a lifelong fan.And,like many,I kind of gave up on them after Promised Land.(Let me just say,the albums after Promised Land were not bad,just not appealing to my ""heavier""tastes)This is a true return to form for Queensryche.Hell,they even threw in a few bars of Revoloution Calling towards the albums end!(Can't remember the title off hand)To Sum it up....this is an EXCELLENT,seamless follow up to Operation Mindcrime!"
4,"FINALLY!!, A GOOD ALBUM FROM THE RYCHE!","This is the first good album since Promised Land. Hear in The Now Frontier, Q2K and Tribe were all weak albums that had them trying to sound like crappy grunge/alternative and crappy nu-metal bands. The best thing is that there are guitar solos on this album! They make a return to their classic sound with guitar riffs and harmonies from the duo of Wilton and Stone. Geoff Tate's voice is not as high as it used to be but still in great form. The duet with Dio is a treat! The album is still growing on me buts it a big improvement over the stuff they've put out the last few years."
5,man these people are on dope,"I don't understand why people dislike this album so much. this is Queensryche's best album in a long time. I did not care for what I heard from the last few albums but this album got my attention. For me this album took me back the music is progressive like their classic stuff. Plus there are songs that make one think of classic Queensryche like ""the hands"" sounds like something off empire and ""I'm American"" makes me think of rage for order. Of course there are some modern sounding songs on here but they are done in a good way. So ignore the negative reviews and buy this album you won't be disapointed if you like classic Queensryche."
3,Feeling the same as another reviewer here.....strong start,"I am pretty much total agreement with another reviewer on here, Nicholas. I also think the first 4 songs are great then we have to wait until Fear City Slide for things to pick back up.Yes, I am still a huge fan. Yes, my favorite all-time Queensryche album is Operation Mindcrime. Yes, I will see them in concert soon. No, the sequel doesn't really blow me away."
3,"Just solid, not spectacular!!!","Ok people, this is not OM1, this is a new Queensryche in a new era, with a tons of musical influences. Think for a moment since '87, there's nineteen years since OM1 was created!!!! But OM2 falls short in musicianship and lacks of passion, something that OM1 got. This is a solid release, and my opinion the best since ""Empire""."
2,Disappointing and Amateurish,"I have been a Queensryche fan since the first EP and have been disspointed with the direction they have been headed in since ""Hear in the Now...""I thought perhaps the sequel to ""Operation Mind Crime"" would harkin back to their roots and produce a good album. Wow was I ever wrong.I have listened to it for 4 days now hoping that perhaps it will grow on me; but alas it has not. The songs are amateurish and weak. The production sounds like a bunch of teenagers recorded it in their bedroom. And with the exception of Scott's drumming (which is always solid) the musicians sound uninspired, like their just going through the motions.I felt ""Promised Land"" was their last good disc. I am officially giving up on them."
2,I really wanted to like this album,"I too felt that Operation Mindcrime was an epic album. It still sits firmly at the top of my all time favorites list.To my great disappointment, Mindcrime II does not have any of the originals greatness. I'm sorry, but this album is unworthy of the name Operation Mindcrime II."
4,Not too shaby!,"Queensryche Has had one disappointment after another since the early 90's. Operation: Mindcrime II however seems to have stopped the bleeding and pointed them back in the right direction.While the album is very inconsistent (as a lot of their albums are) there are many more bright spots on the album than their previous ones.Along with more consistnet song-writing, the album has orchestral overtones spread through some of the album. A great example is the song ""Re-Arrange You"".Other highlights include: Fear City Slide, The Chase, Signs Say Go and I'm American. I'm american music-wise is quite catchy, however the lyrics come across forced and kind of cheesy.On the whole a good, but not great album. Certainly better than anything since Empire."
2,Sorely lacking their leader!,"Queensryche have simply never been anything without Chris DeGarmo. All the albums without him have been pretty much dreadful, and the only good points of ""Tribe"" were the few songs co-written by him. This is just another excuse to latch on to some past glories. And to me, ""Mindcrime"" has never been their pinnacle. I would give that honor to ""Empire""."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This effort was a real letdown. I had a long business trip drive by myself. I had 4hrs. dedicated to listening. I was hoping to find some glimmer of hope. There are a few good songs. That's about it. Their last really good album was Hear In The Now. Nothing great since. I highly recommend seeing them live. I've seen them twice in last 2 years and I'm never disappointed. Fan for life. . ROCK ON ! ! ! C.Kinder / Springboro, Oh."
1,OPERATION: DON'T EVER PUT OUT ANOTHER CD,"i was so looking forward to this cd. what a damn disappointment! the only song that i can listen to is the 6th song Hands, and thats only because it sounds like a song from the first mindcrime cd. it's time queensryche calls it quits or they do a tour like they did last year where their first set was old stuff and their second set was the entire first mindcrime cd. to date, that has been one of the best concerts i have ever seen!!"
3,OK,"Some pretty good songs here, but the production could have been better, I just don't like the way it sounds or I would have given it 4 Stars."
1,MAJOR BUST!!!,"I was wary of this album since almost all sequels are a MAJOR disappointment. Mindcrime II continues the tradition. Nothing on the album is even remotely moving or emotional, like the original. I tried to listen to it for a week, and couldn't figure out was going on. It is now gathering dust. The lyric sheets aren't very helpful, especially being in fine print. If you're a fan of the band, get the LiveCrime and Live Evolution dvds, and the remastered cds (that end with Empire) and leave it at that. Queensryche lost their identity and passion when DeGarmo left (although the Live Evolution dvd is good, but it's because of the older material). Even if the rumored tour takes place with the band doing Mindcrime and Mindcrime II in one concert, I doubt I'd go. If I do, I'll probably leave after the original."
2,"Yes, Mary committed suicide.","Check out Operation VideoCrime (or whatever the title was). After the credits roll out, let the video keep going and you'll find out there's a SECOND version of the video to ""I Don't Believe in Love."" As the solo is ending, words are flying and spinning around the screen. What one word should you look for? SUICIDE."
4,Mindcrime II,"I think that many reviews I am reading are overly negative. This is a good album, it just suffers because it is a sequel to a classic. This is not nearly as good as Mindcrime I, but few albums are, that album is a 5+ on the Amazon scale. This is a solid 4 though because it is the best QR album in many years, is one of the better rock albums I've heard lately, and shows a confidence that many bands from this era are lacking nowadays. I caution everyone to not judge this album solely as it compares to Mindcrime I.This isn't Godfather 2, Aliens, or The Empire Strikes Back in terms of sequels. However, I would give it a solid Lethal Weapon 2 rating as a sequel..."
1,Big Let Down!,"I have been a big QR fan since the Rage For Order album, but the honest truth is that this album is very disappointing. I have always respected these guys, but the table turns when you wait almost 20 years for a follow up album to Operation Mindcrime, and this is what they stick you with. It is sad to see that the best has already came and gone for this band. Losing their original guitarist has definitely been a negative for them. Geoff Tate will always be one of my favorite singers though....right up there with Steve Perry and Bruce Dickinson. However, I am still amazed at the lack of in depth lyrics and musical writing ability that went into this follow up album. I think it would have been a better idea to hire some hotshots outside of the band to do the music writing! Maybe albums like this one are the reason that there is still no Pink Floyd The Wall II!!??Ray LowryLimitedAccesstheband.com"
1,Lord have mercy...,"I HAVE STEPPED IN STUFF THAT SMELLS BETTER THAN THIS...AMBER ALERT!!!: MISSING: SINCE 1997, A GUITARIST WHO WROTE AWESOME LYRICS, MUSIC, AND PLAYED A WICKED GUITAR...IF ANYONE HAS SEEN THIS MAN, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND INSERT HIM IMMEDIATELY BACK INTO HIS RIGHTFUL PLACE...BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE RAN AWAY..."
1,HORRIBLE,This is the absolute worst CD I have heard. In my opinion this is a washed up band trying to extend a previously successful CD. Absolutely horrible.
4,Very good follow up to Mindcrime I,"Just picked up Operation Mindcrime II. My first impression is that this is a very good album. Of course it's not Operation Mindcrime I part 2, It's Operation Mindcrime II. So with that said, if you are looking for the same hard driving aspects of the first album, then you might be some what disapointed. There are a number of songs that are hard driving but many are very rock opera. Either way, it sounds good to me.My two favorite songs so far are I'm American and The Chase. On The Chase, Ronnie James Dio plays the part of Dr. X. Anytime you can have Dio and Tate on one song it is like magic.The band sounds good on the album and Geoffs voice is great as always. This is the best album Ryche has put out in a while. If you are a Ryche fan I would pick it up, I think you will enjoy it."
2,Suffers from the classic late Queensryche failure,"There are just too few tunes. The original Mindcrime was a fanatastic combination of metal and melody. A lot of Mindcrime II comes across as simply noise.Mr Tate's voice ( as strong as it is ), is clearly not the thunderous organ of his younger self and at times sounds very weak and is swamped by the ""music"".The story is not very clear and I'm afraid simply not interesting to the listener.This is a BIG disappointment."
3,Operation: Mindcrime II,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original and Queensr?che's latest is no exception. I like it enough to play over and over at work but it doesn't blow me away like the original.No matter how many times I listen, I'll never get used to Pamela Moore's cheesy 80's singing style. She's the female equivalent of the guy who sings in those ""Real Men of Genius"" Budweiser commercials, even though he's doing it tongue-in-cheek."
3,Just ok,"The only common think between Operation Mindcrime 1 & 2 is the title. The first one is a masterpiece while the second is just ok. The songs here are not bad and not good. Unfortunately after Promised Land the albums are very average, there is no exception here. YOu can here sometimes this album but it wont remain for too long. There previous album Tribe is a little better than this one. I hope they change (return to their older stuff) in the near future."
3,"Okay, I need a better guitar tone here...","What is going on with the guitar mix? There is no bandwidth, no seperation, not even detectable stereo 80% of the album. Not fun to listen to without some thickness, ya know?A metal album first and foremost HAS to have a killer guitar tone. Especially from a heavy hitter big name band. Okay, some parts sound pretty good. Then, there are sections without a guitar at all that sound really unfinished, like they weren't done with the tracks and ran out of money/time? I dunno. What up, guys?Get DeGarmo over there right away. Somebody help them with that! I can get a better sound in my buddy's studio, by far. And we don't even know what we're doing!Still a big 'Ryche fan, just grinning and bearing it for the most part.Personally, I enjoy my new re-masters of the first 4 albums much more."
3,Don't expect the original,"Ok, I've listened to this CD once so I need to give it some more time. But my first impression is that there is one critical aspect missing from this one....Chris DeGarmo. I didn't realize what a crucial piece of the band he was until I listened to this CD. If you'll listen to the first one and then listen to this one, you'll see what I mean. His guitar drove the music in the first one. It established the mood, the tone, and the melodies. And none of them seem to be in this one. There's also a lack of all the cool dialogue that existed in the first one...what happened to that? That dialogue totally set up the story but it doesn't exist in the second. Remember how the first was on the verge of theatrical? Not this one."
5,Worthy,"This album does the exact same thing that the original accomplished: captured a feel for a story. The original captured a haunting air of mystery, (at least the last half of the album did) and OM II captures the idea of revenge. It's harder to listen to than the original (not in a bad way), but that's because it's more frantic. I believe it's suppose to be that way since Nikki's doing whatever it takes to track down and get revenge on Dr. X. I think that within a couple of listens, people will undestand it and give it the appreciation it deserves."
4,Queensryche-Operation Mindcrime II,"I have been a fan of QR from the start, saw them in 1985 (warning tour). I have a great appreciation for these guys and the fact that they do not concern themselves with what is expected of them. They just put out the alblum they want and if we, the fans like it then great if not, too bad. That being said I have loved almost everything they have done. Operation Mindcrime was a masterpiece of Rock Opera, a unique take on the twisted reality that is religion and politics. I have rocked that alblum sooo many times..........Operation Mindcrime II does well in that it picks up the story of our anti-hero when he is being released from prison and tells of his ongoing struggles. It has many a great Rock n Roll song and riffs but at times lacks the harder edge that was the origanal. If you are a long time fan, get it. If this is your first QR alblum then get something else like Promised Land, Mindcrime I or Empire."
4,Give it at least 10 listens,"It's quite amazing how repeated listening to an album will change your perspective of it. I posted a review of this album a week ago only giving it 2 stars and basically trashing it. Well, after more spins on the Ipod I've changed my stance drastically. This album rocks in many ways. No, it's not nearly up to par with O:M 1. But this is easily their best album since Promised Land. I'm really enjoying it now. If you like the post Promised Land sound of QR you will easily find merit in this album. If you prefer the early QR sound please give it about 9 more listens to and see if you still don't like it; odds are you will."
3,Okay,"Not as bad as some have said it is. After listening to this for a week now I can safely say this album is um...mediocre. There are some good songs here. The Hands, Hostage, I'm American...all good songs. Most of the others are pretty forgettable. I agree with what others have said. Most of these songs are missing a good riff or a catchy chorus that would make them memorable. I also thought the album would have more to say about the social and political mess the world is in right now. I am kinda disapointed. Oh well. I still hope these guys make a killer album again. I keep my fingers crossed."
4,"You can't go back, but..........","I've been a Queensryche fan since the Ep was released over 20 years ago and the last cd I really enjoyed by the band was Promised Land. While its not thier best cd, OM2 falls right in stride with the listening enjoyment of thier earlier cd's. If you liked Queensryche then, chances are, you will enjoy this cd. It took 2-3 times of listening to the cd for it to grow on me, so, don't discard it on the very first try. It grows on you real fast."
2,Horrible...Queensryche sucks without Degarmo,How a band can continue to write and release songs under the Queensryche name when their main songwriter leaves the band is beyond me.There isn't a soul left in the band that knows how to write good music. The new guitarist Stone is useless...he should be playing in a blues rock band...not Queensryche.Tate has lost a lot of range from his voice. Who cares is he can occasionaly hit a high note...he no longer sounds comfortable in the upper ranges and his lower note singing is very sub par.Time to retire. This last ditch effort to make $$ isn't fooling anyone. Geoff Tate also has professed that he doesn't like metal. So the only reason he would continue playing it is for $$.It's truly sad what Queensryche has become. The original Mindcrime was masterpiece. I don't even know what to call this mess called Mindcrime II. I don't know what's worse...Mindcrime II or St. Anger.
1,Horrible Follow-up From A Band Who Should've Known Better,"How dare Queensryche tarnish the good name of the brilliant Operation Mindcrime with this lame piece of trash. The absolute worst drum sounds on any major release in the modern era. Overblown sound effects do little to hide the trite lyrics, lackluster vocals, and weak guitar work. The most disappointing cd of the year by far and though not the worst of Queensryche's career, certainly the biggest rip-off since the title implies that the material will be as strong as Mindcrime 1. It's not even close."
2,THE ORIGINAL WAS A MASTERPIECE,"AFTER LISTENING TO THE NEW MINDCRIME CD IT FALLS EXTREMLY SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL. I THINK THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE LOSS OF CHRIS DEGARMO.TATE IS STILL A VOCAL GOD,BUT NOT EVEN HE COULD MAKE THE NEW MINDCRIME MATCH UP.AS FAR AS CONCEPT ALBUMS GO,THE ORIGINAL WAS A MASTERPIECE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Very Pleasent Surprise,"I got OMII very skeptical of where Qryche would go with it. I was and am very happy with the music and progression of the album. First listen I was trying to take it all in and was luke warm to it.... three listens later I really think its a great album.Its a good mix of old sounds with a new 2006 touch to it. It lacks the overall horsepower of the original, but is still a very good album. Tates voice is haunting at times as is the theme, a ride thru the disturbed mind of Nikki as he seeks revenge.Overall - I'll give it a B+ or A minus... good job Qryche!!"
3,The DeGarmo Factor,"I've been trying to put my finger on this cd and what's missing. But alot of other fans have already said it. And I'm not trying to compare this cd to the first Mindcrime, but you almost have to. The music here seems forced and strained, almost as if Geoff Tate just wanted to get it out to keep the band going. The creative juices are absolutely missing here to be sure. The one good thing that I will say is that the cd clocks in at 60 minutes, just like Mindcrime I, but then again, that might not be a good thing because of the lacking of quality that this cd exhibits. I just don't know, I like the sound of Queensryche, but this cd just doesn't do it for me. They just put something together as an extension of Q2K and that basic straight ahead rock which is fine, but I believe they could have done much better, especially for a concept album such as this. Oh, the joys of better days when you were trying to be original. Days gone past. Let's wait and see what's next."
1,Very disappointing...,"Operation : Mindcrime was one of the best cd's evetr made. That was the one cd that got me in to all the stuff I like now. It even tought me alot on the drums. So, when I hear there's a new SEQUEL coming... of course I jump. I just couldn't believe that they actually slapped an OPERATION : MINDCRIME label on it and tried to pass it as a sequel. Actually, I don't think that this cd would've been near as horrible if Chris DeGarmo was still with the band and had a hand in its creation. Geoff Tate can not write lyrics... Chris wrote 90% of the lyrics in the original, and ended up with epics like 'Suite Sister Mary', and Geoff ended up with 'I'm American' after his failed attempt to write songs on the new cd... maybe it's about time to give it up."
1,Operation Mindflop!,"When I heard there was going to be a sequel toOperation Mindcrime(one of the best album's of all time)I was as a little worried.Could the band possibly write anything forthis sequel without their guitarist(Chris Degarmo their main composer)that left in '98.They've only had two good songs(Breakdown from Q2K and Open from Tribe)since then and Chris cowrote the latter.I made myself listen to OMII the day it came out.Just as I thought,only one song stands out on this platter.(I'm American) No new ground being broken here.I'm wondering if the band is in touch with their musicality anymore. I miss the true melody in their old music that they have for gotten to include in their new projects.Why put this disc out when it's this bad.. Hopefully they can start from scratch and find a new direction.IS ANYBODY LISTENING??? O'I REMEMBER NOW!!!"
3,Mindcrime2,"Listened to the album only once and thought it wasnt initially as good as om1, but yeah thats just the first impression. For True Queensryche fans I'm sure it's one of those records that need listening to overe and over to appreciate the true craftmanship.This reminds me of the so called Metallica fans when Load came out."
3,Almost there,"Great idea I like the soryline they were going with. But Again another 'ryche album without Chris... Chris was to relevent of a contribution during 'ryches heyday and is still painfully missing Don't get me wrong i like 'ryche. And bands change , If chris does not want to be involved that's a band issue.Nothing the fans can do to change it. But.... 'ryche have been boken since Hear in the now frontier. A few more listens and i'm sure it will gain a star better than what i gave it. And hey chris... WE MISS YOU AND THE 'RYCHE NEEDS YOU."
2,When everything is just average...,"Compared to HITNF, Q2k & Tribe, this must be their best album so far, but if you just listened to the complexity of OM I, the sad beauty of Promised Land, the energy of Warning, or the divine tech-metal of Rage for Order, even the more commercial Empire, you will be sadly dissapointed. Do yourself a favour, check out Pain of Salvation, or Evergrey... Maybe Wolverine?"
1,Downfall of the Ryche,"I can't believe this band is still trying to ""recapture"" the sound of their glory days. They have been on a constant downfall for years. They have put out many bad albums but trying to revive the Mindcrime spirit by just naming an album Mindcrime II is a shame. Without DeGarmo this band cannot write songs. Sorry that's the fact. The storyline is boring and predictable. The production is sterile and hygenic. The guitar work is truly awful. It is so forced only so it sounds 80's but still you can tell it's forced. Tate's vocals are weaker than before even though I give him credit for trying. Get the early albums of Ryche and stay away from this."
1,Just downright BAD!,"BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!! I could go on and on listing many reasons why this CD is aweful, but I don't have the time. Just know that, for every reason possible, this CD is just downright BAD! I feel somewhat cheated that I paid full price for this. At least at a restaraunt you can send the meal back if it is bad, what is one to do with this? It's more dissapointing than anything because I know that the band, and the production crew who recorded it, are capable of so much more. I have faith in them, I know that they can do better. If anything, they should put the next ""good"" CD out for free to make up for this anamolie."
4,Best release since Mindcrime 1,"People...We already knew it could never match MC I, one of the best CDs ever. MC II stands on it's own merit. The story is deep, if not a little slow at the start. They did a nice job of returning to the 80's sounding guitars and the solos are pretty good. This album is much more cohesive when listened to start to finish and will grow on you. The bass and drums are tight and Mary is back on a few tracks. Good stuff. Nice comeback by QR. BTW, I like the original theme and cover art and I'm glad they didn't change it.When I'm suffocating..It gives me air. Most QR fans will like this release."
4,Overly harsh critics need to chill out.,"OMII is a good cd. I've listened to is many times over the past week. At first I was impressed, then my enthusiasm waned some. Finally, I listened to OMI and OMII is succession and my opinion of this CD went back up. OMI and OMII flow quite nicely together and I am looking forward to seeing both CDs performed live on QR's upcoming tour.OMII is easily their best CD since Promised Land, and in my opninion it may be better than Empire, a CD I was always lukewarm on. To be sure OMII is not the master piece OMI was, and that may be the source of some folks overly harsh reviews of this CD."
1,They should have thrown in the towel a while back.,"I've been a Ryche fan since the days of ""Queen of the Reich"" and ""Warning"" and took great pride in calling them one of my favorite bands. Like my other favorite band (Rush), what I liked best about them was that they didn't sound like everyone else. Compare ""Rage for Order"" with anything else that came out in 1986 and you'll see what I mean. Same with the original ""Operation Mindcrime."" Fast forward to 2006 and OMII is just miserable. It's as if they've lost their identity. Come to think of it - they did when Chris Degarmo, who along with Tate and Rockenfield were the heart of the band.And what's with the cheesy keyboards? I'm not against keyboards, only when they sound like they came from a Casio."
1,Queensruche is DONE!,"Without Degarmo...this band is floundering musically.What a shame, they were once a great band. This sequel is horrible.Its amazing how much Queensryche Degarmo really was/is....No hooks, no musicality, very cold stale music..The new guitarist sucks.This band is done! They no longer exist."
3,QR fan ... Fair ...Hope it grows on me!,"Here's my honest review:Of course, me being a long time QR fan I could be biased. Sure I'm going to listen again and again. So far there's one worthy song City Slide ~ something like that. QR seem to be trying too hard and missing the point. Sure Operation Mindcrime told a story...it included great songs that when put together worked. QR tried too hard to tell a story here. O:M II is not about the songs. I hate to say this, but I want to go back to the Rage for Order, O:M, Empire songs. There's interesting guitar, catchy lyrics, and somewhat of a song structure. O:M II songs seem to start rapping out words to a story. Not even Dio could save it.It's like what I say about Van Halen with David Lee Roth. The reunion sounds great, but when you think about the realities of where these guys are today and how they would sound today...it would suck bad. Sometimes you shouldn't go back...unless you had Degarmo. And even then..."
1,Worse than bad...,"The original Operation Mindcrime was a masterpiece that transends decades and styles. Truly amazing.When I heard of this new album, I eagerly jumped for it... and I've tried over and over to listen to it and appreciate it.It can't be done. It's abysmal. Truly terrible.I miss Queensryche and their great albums, but this is a shadow of what they once were. There are 1 or 2 minor gems in the mix, but the rest of the album is unbearably bad.Sorry, but it has to be said."
5,Dope as hell,It's a great CD for any tru hip hop fans. To all the thugs out there this cd is goin on. It's tight.
4,"Wonderful.... soothing, and sensational","Sarah McLachlan is a very talented artist, this cd is packed with beautifully written, and amazing songs. However the magic begins to die as they all begin to sound a bit the same. I would definetly recommend this cd to everyone... it is beyond sensational, however it offers no more then as I say... soothing, and beautiful music. It does not have any snappy music to offer to add some change, however you will all be impressed by the works of art preformed by Ms. McLachlan. Enjoy!"
4,One of My Favorite,"It's a great Cd. I love the song I Will Remember You, it's the only reason I got it, but I've fallen in love with the others. The only thing I didn't like was the audience's noise in the background."
5,Greatest Hits Live,Adia sounds great with it's harmonies and the whole album is just a greatest hits of Sarah's but it's totally worth it. The reason for this is because the songs don't totally sound the same as they would on the original CD's. The songs are totally great and you wouldn't have to buy the other CDs to get all the songs...if you love Sarah go out and get this thing today..don't wait..she's worth it.
5,"If you love Sarah McLachlan, you'll love this CD!","""Mirrorball"" is a must for any Sarah McLachlan fan. It might as well be a Greatest hits CD, because it has songs from all her albums on it. The songs don't sound that differently from the album versions, but they do have live appeal to them. This is a great CD!!"
5,Incredible,"I received a copy of ""Mirrorball"" early, and I am absolutely in love with it. It is truly incredible, and i think she is one of the few artists who sound better live."
3,"Energetic, yet flat","This is the first time I've really listened to McLachlan, and I was a bit disappointed. I loved ""i will remember you"" and ""mystery"" - but the rest seemed flat.Her lyrics are great and meaningful, but lack what good songs need: a hook. W/o hooks, her songs sort of mush together and are completely un-memorable. If she added a ""pop"" sound, w/ catchy lines and an up-beat rythem, she'd soar even higher than she already is.None-the-less, McLachlan has a ton of talent, and screams ""superstar"" w/ most of her songs. Her energy and enthusiasm carry this CD.Buy it, try it, see if you like it. PS - another good ""live"" group is Marcy Playground."
5,WOW!,"This album is a great mix of smooth, soul seeking music like ""Angel""quick witted loveable music like""Ice Cream"" This album has something for everyone! When you listen to, if you close you eyes it feels like you a standing right next to her! I love this album, and you will too!"
2,re-releasing old songs?,"I can't believe there' sonly 4? new songs on this album! . Her best CD was her mystery single (possession, I will remember you, angel, building a mystery), because it showcased only the good ones. Check your other Mclachlan CD song lists before considering this one. It seems that her albums just rehashes old songs."
1,a sham,"the problem with sarah is she cannot decide if she'd like to be tori amos or celiene dion. she fails miserably at both. for an example of a TRULY passionate live performance, try ani difranco's ""living in clip"" or tori amos' ""to venus and back""."
1,Nothing really special,"First of all I would just like to say that I have been a devout fan of Sarah's since I first heard ""Fumbling."" Sarah is a beautiful person and the music is honest and poignant. Having made this clear, I have to say I was disappointed with ""Mirrorball"" -- not because it's bad, but because it doesn't offer much that isn't already out. I can barely note the difference between the original songs and ""Mirrorball"" versions. I was expecting a compilatoin along the lines of ""The Freedom Sessions""/""Rarities&B-Sides"" and got, well.... All you get with this CD is the same Sarah you hear on ""Surfacing"" and ""Fumbling."""
1,"Stop the Ego! ""Mirrorball"" an Exercise in Narcissism","I'm amazed at all the glowing reviews below. This is one of the few times I agree with the press which has been pretty harsh on this tepid and genteel release from Sarah.Understandably, she is now big in the US after being huge in Canada for a decade. But how long will she continue to milk her fanbase with in-between-studio-album releases instead of delivering the goods? While I appreciate her point that songs evolve over time with performance and hindsight -- how many versions of ""Hold On"" and ""Ice Cream"" does the world need?Let's see . . . there's the ""Hold On"" from ""No Alternative,"" the ""Hold On"" from ""Fumbling,"" the ""Hold On"" from ""Sessions,"" and now the ""Hold On"" from ""Mirrorball."" AUGH! A similar lineage can be said for ""Ice Cream.""How about NEW songs instead of the same old stuff over and over and over again?"
4,Great stuff!,"Alright, I admit it... as a 20 year old guy, I was a little hesitant to buy a Sarah McLachlan ""chick music"" CD. Then I broke down and finally did it, and I'm glad I did! This features all of the songs you might've heard and loved - ""Building a Mystery"", ""Ice Cream"", and etc. - plus the awesome ""I Will Remember You"" and other greats! There's not a bad song on the CD."
4,Nearly Perfect,"Usually something gets lost in the translation when an artist records a concert performance. There is just no way to actually capture the moment when the connection is made between artist and audience. On the Mirrorball CD, however, Sarah McLachlan has done just that. The only thing missing is the press of the crowd. Listen to this CD with about a hundred or so close friends, and you'll even have that."
5,Pure talent,"Sarah McLachlan truly shines in this marvelous album. She clearly impresses her many fans with that voice and that spirit she has within her, the energy and the sadness. I Will Remember You is such a wonderful song, magical yet painfully honest. You can tell she really loves to sing and the joy she brings us is more than enough for us to be loyal fans. She is one of the FEW artists who dwell on true talent, voice and song-wise, and not on sex appeal..."
4,Just Lovely,"I'm new to Sarah McLachan's music but I loved this CD, especially songs like ""I Love You"" and ""I Will Remember You"" and one that really gets me going, ""Building A Mystery""."
3,Could've been better,"I am Sarah's #1 fan in the world so I feel guilty not giving mirrorball five stars. The problem is I listen to Sarah so much that a live album like this with no new material bored me pretty quickly since there is not much deviation from the studio versions. It should have had more songs from ""solace"" and at least ""vox"" from ""touch"". I really think it should've been a double cd taped from ONE show. That would be the only way to capture the ""live sarah mclachlan experience"" that leaves YOU surrendering to HER on your knees."
2,I love Sarah but with this one she really let me down.,It had the songs that represent her conformation to the general public. She should return to her previous way of singing. She has such a wonderful voice if only she wouldn't have given in to pop culture. Right now I need to be alone in my thoughts and remember the old Sarah. Hopefully she will come out with a new CD that is more like the Sarah that I have come to love.
5,I'd take this one to a desert island :),"Some live CDs fall short of revealing anything new and interesting about a performer. In Mirrorball, Sarah is better than her recorded tracks. Every song presents a new twist on the original. Love it."
2,Doesn't capture the essence of seeing McLachlan live,"Sarah's ""Mirrorball"" album is an overproduced, uninspired work. Anyone who has seen Sarah live should know that this live album doesn't do her justice at all. The tracks are too glossy and often don't even sound live, like ""Sweet Surrender"", ""I Love You"" and ""Possession"". Hopefully Sarah's new ""Afterglow Live"" CD will be a better example of how radiant Sarah McLachlan is in concert."
1,ughhhh,"First of all this woman can hardly sing. Why is she putting out a cd that consists of songs she had already released? I don't understand why everyone likes her, and I would say DO NOT get this cd."
1,Do We Deserve This?,"I was never a Sarah McLachlan fan, a friend of mine handed me this cd and said it's so deep. After listening to this I came to the conclusion that it was deep, wallowing deep in misery. Sarah takes her same old tired songs and does them live, giving her the ample opportunity to expand every nuance of the music making it seem almost unbearable. If you are a Sarh McLachlin fan stick to her older works, someone made the mistake of calling her a diva and she is taking it to the extreme."
3,Beware: Live album,"As much as I like Sarah McLachlan songs, I was very disappointed in the fact that this CD was live. Although this performance was much better than most live recordings. I would not have bought it had I known it was live."
5,GREAT CD!!!!!,"Exactly what I was looking for and more.Arrived as described, and in even better condition!I was very happy with the product!!!!"
5,"""hold on"" brings tears to my eyes","It has been a couple of month since I has free time out of my hectic life and listened to this cd. Sometime the work life is repeatitive and time consuming, it makes you yern to feel alife.Just a few minutes ago, I played this cd, and listening to the song ""hold on"" brought tears to my eyes. Her lyrics are so powerful, and envoked such strong emotions, I had to repost my review of this cd.I remember the first time I heard Sarah's, I dismissed it thinking her tunes weren't catchy enough. It was a couple month later, the same song played again, but the experience described in the lyrics hit home this time. I think for those who haven't yet truely experienced Sarahs music, they just need to connect to a single song then they will begin to understand.Anyway, I previously gave this cd 4/5 since its a compilation. But looking at this cd by itself, its a 5/5. If you haven't heard of Sarahs music, you owe it to yourself to give it a try."
4,A Greatest Hits and Live CD Rolled Up Into One,"For me at least this CD contains many of Sarah's greatest hits and that combined with the fact that it is a live performance seems to make for a pretty decent album. With hard to find songs like ""I Will Remember You"" and such great hits as ""Fumbling"" and ""Building A Mystery"" this album is a good introduction to Sarah's work in general. And if you have all of her other albums these live renditions will be a nice addition."
5,live is best,"You can tell the real talent of an artist/band based on their live performance. The best thing,for me, about live music is the ENERGY, and this cd has plenty of it. This cd introduced me to Sarah's music and made me a fan for life. It is one of those rare cds that I can play all the way through and love every track. This was my first Sarah cd and I would recommend it as a starter for any new fans. All the good things you have heard about Sarah's music are true. But don't take my word for it...listen to it for yourself."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is a must have for Sarah fans. I got this CD yesterday and I have NOT been able to take it out of my CD player! This CD accents her amazing music talents and how great a musician she is. She takes her best songs and turns them into brand new masterpieces (""Hold On"" has been changed from great to amazing). You need to buy this CD. If you don't have it you don't know what you're missing- and that is a WHOLE LOT! Bravi, Sarah!"
5,best live CD I've heard,"I like listening to Sarah McLachlin on the radio, but until I listened to her online concert performing the songs from ""Mirrorball,"" I never knew how widespread her talent reached. I listened to the concert twice in one night and ordered the CD from amazon.com immediately afterwards. Sarah has a unique style all her own. Each of her songs is filled with emotion; no two songs sound the same. After hearing the CD, my new favorite song is ""Fear."" It shows Sarah's high vocal range I never knew she had."
4,"Good, but incomplete.","This CD contains Sarah's most popular songs, but I recommend buying the Complete Concert version instead. It has nine more songs including a few from the Touch and Solace albums."
5,A GREAT CD!!!,"Mirrorball is a mustbuy for any Sarah fan. Sarah put a lot of her fans favorite songs on this CD: Building a Mystery, Possession, The Path of Thorns, Angel, Sweet Surrender, Ice Cream, Adia, I Love You, Do What You Have to Do, Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, Good Enough, Hold On, Fear, and I Will Remember You. Even though I would have liked to see Black (from the X-Files album) and Black and White from Surfacing, she has enough great songs that not even I'll put to much effort into complaining about. Whoever buys this CD, will not be let down."
4,This is not a live album!,"It's a collection of live songs yes, but it is not what I expected from Sarah. The recordings are fantastic, the song list has all the hits, but where is the true nature of a Sarah live show? Being a real fan of live music, I was disappointed to hear a whole bunch of tracks strung together in no logical order at all. I would have rather had a disc that did a better job of pulling you into a real concert, rather than a bunch of live ""radio friendly"" snippets.You have to give it a high mark though, if for no other reason than Sarah's amazing voice and live presence. Possession is amazing, and the recordings are all crisp and perfect. Buy it and remix it!"
5,Very different from the studio albums,"If you're worried that this is just a rehash of her studio albums, worry no more. The live versions are much different from the studio versions. For most, I'd say better. In Building a Mystery, she's playing to the audience (who you can hear cheer on Sarah). Possession is meant to be played at full volume (wonderful!). Do What You Have to Do takes on a sadder tone that on Surfacing -- it's full of the wonderful pathos that only Sarah can do. The only song which I really miss is Witness -- I'll bet that sounds amazing live (based on what she did with Possession).So, unless you hate live recordings, this is worth getting.P.S. I bought this CD from another source -- they include a second CD free with 4 other live songs."
2,"Beautiful voice, not always beautiful words","First Sarah McLachlan cd I've ever bought. I think she has a very beautiful voice. However, as I was sitting there listening to the first track, ""Building a Mystery"", out of nowhere comes the f-word! Another track later I hear ""bulls**t"". Sorry Sarah, I don't allow those words in my house. I took the cd back to the store."
1,"THANKS FOR ANOTHER ""NOT"" NEW ALBUM","I'm tired of these mega huge ""artists"" re-releasing the same songs over and over again. With all the Lilith Fair CD's flooding the market all of the sudden, there is no need for yet another live recording of previously recorded songs (that listeners already paid for!) How about some NEW SONGS!"
2,Why live performance????,"Most of the songs were absolutely amazing She has a great voice and the texts moves me... But WHY did it have to be a live performance??? I ruins the whole album. I am sure that the people that were present were very happy, but as a person who is very sensetive to sound, appreciate the purity in sound, the background noice was a huge distraction. Sarah, there is nothing wrong in doing a studio recording. You can still capture the soul of the music in a studio. All I can say is that I am waiting for the album to be re-released as a studio recording with no distracting noice that does not represent the music. I want to hear the Sarah and ONLY Sarah!"
2,Disappointing,"I am pissed off that ""I Will Remember You"" is a horrible version. One-Third of the original song is chopped off for no apparent reason. Plus there is way too much audience interferance. If you want a good Sarah McLachlan album buy ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" or ""Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff."" Trust Me."
1,BUY ONE SM CD--YOU'VE BOUGHT EM ALL,"Is is just my imagination, or does Sarah McLachlan repeatedly re-release her songs on follow-up albums? I love her music--but I don't want to keep buying the same song sover and over again--what's UP with that??? While I considered purchasing Mirrorball, I looked back over my collection and realized I have virtually every song on it! You call that a NEW release>???? :-0"
5,"Intense Power Play, Sarah is truely ""Good Enough""","Before ""Lilith Fair"", There must be speculation of how Sarah become the main pillar of the event... ""Mirrorball"" had proved her vocal worth and on-stage charisma. From the crowd raoring ""Buliding a Mystery"", to the enchanting ""Good enough""... Sarah must have moved my heart with waves that stormed my hearing. I am sure to say this is one of the best live album I ever heard. I guess this is the best to get, for the fact that Sarah or other members of the ""Lilith Fair"" is unlikely to drop by my country."
4,"It is excellent , easy to get in to . lovely music.","I keep this on whenever I can. Mostly in the evenings when I wont to unwind. Her voice is excellent. She really knows how to identify with feelings, and emotions. I get a real sence of peace when I hear the music. I seem to blend in with it. An excellent way to make it all seem worthwhile . A real find in today`s hectic world."
3,When will she learn?,"Sara is extremely talented...no question about it. I love her voice and her music is powerful and if you were to have one album from her, this is it. Her live performances are far more energetic than her studio ones. But, she needs to learn what Sting, Paul Simon and Lyle Lovett have learned. To be artistic, powerful and meaningful you don't have to write music that is so dark, somber and introspective. An uplifting album from Sara, both in words and in tone of music, would be a truly powerful album and no doubt her best."
5,Great voice...and Live !!!,"This is an amazing CD. All of the old and new recordings perfomed live. How can you not love her voice? It is as amazing as ever. Her studio and live voice are one and the same. No enhancements needed, thank you very much.For all you people who are complaining about crowd noise on the album...have you ever been to a live show? There ""are"" people there.Love it. Love her.Lilith Fair tomorrow....can't wait !!!"
5,YES!!,"Sarah McLachlan has shined yet again with Mirrorball! I love it! I take it everywhere! I won't let it out of my sight! My favorite song is 'I Will Remember You' so i love this CD natually. AND Adia, Sweet Surrender, and Biulding A Mystery are all great too! Congrats Sarah!"
5,"Sarah is at her best, live.","The first thing that will strike you when this cd starts to play, is the sound. It is so clear and vibrant, you can feel the energy running through the crowd, and the music has such power. At first I was reluctant to buy this album, as I have most of the songs on her studio albums anyway. But now, I am so glad I did. They are just so much more powerful performed live like this. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves Sarah's music, no matter how many of her studio albums you may have. The 20 page booklet contains all lyrics and photos of Sarah and the musicians. This is also an enhanced cd, with interesting features."
2,not for me,"I am not as fond of this album as I am of her studio albums. I find that some live albums can be self-indulgent, and unless you're a hardcore fan, they do nothing for you. And that's the case with this album."
3,Great for Sarah newbies,"I must admit that Mirrorball is beautiful to listen to. Sarah puts so much passion and energy into her music and it's truly inspiring. However, this cd just doesn't contain enough of her older material. Ice is one of Sarah's most chilling songs, and Into the Fire is her fastest and one of her catchiest songs. Still, with the material presented, Sarah and her band create an energy so amazing that it almost, just almost, makes up for the lack of older material. And after watching the Mirrorball DVD, I was disappointed that she didn't include Vox on this cd. That's truly a gem."
2,a smooth largo beat.......explains all.,"I think that this is all far too similar. Have artists not heard of varying their music to the audience? It's all very slow, and boring, some up beat rhythms, and a bit more percussion could really liven up these tunes."
5,Sarah Gives Us Her Heart....,"I have both Surfacing and Fumbling Toward Ecstasy, and I loved both, and this CD is comprised mainly between the two. I loved hearing Sarah sing in reaction to an audience, her performances are quite intimate...of course, this CD having ""I Will Remember You"" was worth buying it even if all Sarah did for the rest of the album was to read from the Yellow Pages!!! I get something different from Sarah's songs each time I hear them. It is like she is singing from my life. Thank you, Sarah, for sharing this hatful of diamonds with us."
3,Go For Fumbling Towards Ecstacy For A Real McLachlan Experience,"Nobody can argue that this beauty has one of the most empirically pure and beautiful voices of all time. And, her lyrics are shrouded poems of both elegance and pain. However, this album is not her best work. I say that because I have seen her in concert five times, and, when she was doing the Lilith Fair, she performed this album verbatim (right down to the Ice Cream singalong....even using the exact same prompts to the audience). It was quite a let down and takes away from the spontaneity of a ""Live"" album (or concert, for that matter). When one sees an artist multiple times, they want some surprises and variation. This album is somewhat forced and contrived. ""Fear"" was probably the most powerful on this album. Still, if you are a die hard fan, you must have it to complete your shrine. If not, forgo it and skip to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or The Freedom Sessions, which has the greatest version of Elsewhere."
5,I loooove this,"I LOVE sarah..... but this one tops them all!I unwrapped the cd, put it into my cd player in the car, turned the volume up... and started to drive...and I hear her singing - crystal clear - LIVE with fans screaming, and her voice couldn't be more perfect, her music couldn't be more rich, I was mesmorized.I have now listened to this cd so many times that I would gnaw off my right arm to make sure no one would borrow this from me. This is a MUST HAVE in any collection. I looove this cd and trust me, you will too!"
5,Love It!!!,"This album is like a greatest hits album. All of the songs are awesome! A fun one to listen to! I love Sarah and if you don't already, you will after you listen to this!"
5,I love the wide sound on this cd,"I really enjoyed ""Fumbling towards Ecstacy"" and ""Surfacing"", but what I love most about ""Mirroball"" is the wonderful accoustics and just the overall sound of this cd. As opposed to her studio recordings, from which you can tell are recorded in a rather small room, Sara and her band really get a great sound on stage. She sounds every bit as good live as she does in her other recordings, and I happen to like her voice better live, because she is more expressive. This CD is definately worth checking out."
5,A true musician who is the epitome of greatness.,"Sarah is the best artist I have heard in a long time. All her albums possess a greatness not found in many recordings today. I have heard several live versions from the radio and the minute this album hits the stores, I will be there! I Will Remember You holds a very special meaning in my life. It is the song I gave to one of my closest friends when I moved away for college. It is also the song that brought me comfort and faith when my grandfather passed away. This is the impact of Sarah McLachlan. She finds the words we can't express. Her music touches our deepest emotions ~ those we keep locked up inside that we never dare reveal to anyone. Every concert of hers that I attend surpasses her studio recordings in a way that I can't even imagine. I never thought she could sound any better ~ belive me, she does!!! Thank you Sarah, for sharing your gift with the world."
5,Sarah Blows Me Away!,"I was driving down the highway when my local radio station decided to play the live version of ""Possession"" from Mirrorball. I almost had to pull over, it was so unbelievable. I'm a big fan of all her music, and love both versions of ""Possession"" found on Fumbling Towards Ecstacy (my all-time favorite CD) but this live version is a must-hear! She blew me away with her sheer vocal power and fresh take on a well-worn favorite. The effect is raw, yet emotional and very energizing. This song has always brought me great memories, but as many times as I've heard it, this one's like a new gift. If the rest of the album is half as good, it still rates more stars than I can give."
4,Great!.... but missing something,"I've been waiting for a ""Live"" album from Sarah Mclachlan, having seen her in concert. This fills the void, but I have to ask who made the decision to put the bonus disk in the package and only fill it with three songs? Where are ""Vox"" and ""Into the Fire,"" two songs she did on her tour regularly."
2,WHERE'S THE NEW STUFF??!!!,"mirrorball is a beautifully recorded cd, however, is a disapointment. this cd is generally for the ""new age"" sarah fans that have started to follow all of those now over played generic radio songs, (i.e..building a mystery, adia, sweet surrender...). what about the devoted sarah fans that have been with her since ""OCTOBER GAME"" and ""TOUCH?"" there are beautiful songs on solace and touch as well. also, if it was necessary to put all of the radio songs on there, at least compensate it with a few new songs. in addition, there are many true sarah fans out there who, like me, probably have every live bootleg cd that is out there. this cd didn't sound like anything different. don't get me wrong, sarah is my girl but, i really expected more. if you just started following sarah, it's a great cd that you should own."
3,"Like Sarah, but not impressed with this..","This album doesn't showcase her songs exceptionally well, there's not too much difference with these and the ones done in the studio. Also, most people who release live albums put in songs never done before, whether new songs or covers of other people's songs. She doesn't do either of those, so since this album doesn't seem to have any ""extra"" treats, I don't see the point in getting this. It actually seems like it was hastily put together. While I do like sarah alot, even though she doesn't have alot of range in her voice and her falsettos sound annoying at times, I can't recommend this album too much."
3,Good...but not great,"When I saw Sarah 2 years ago in concert, I was taken aback. It was the Surfacing tour, and the music was wonderful. She literally played every song from Surfacing and Fumbling, and the concert absolutely blew me away. The best 2 1/2 hours of my life. (Even better than when I saw my fave band Pearl Jam) This cd, however, doesn't emit the same magic as the live show, but it's still good. If you've never seen her live, pick this up. But if you have seen her, this may be a little less beautiful--but still worth buying."
3,been there done that,"If you are a Sarah fan,you've already heard this album most likely.All they've done is record her singing a compilation of her songs live.Now if you don't own any of her albums,this is the way to go.You get a good sampling of her albums.I enjoyed the album, but was expecting more than a rehash I guess."
4,Collection,I bought this cd because I liked many of Sarah's songs but didn't want to buy all the different cds. I enjoy this cd since it has all of her hit songs and its like it is on a personal level. It is a great addition to any cd collection.
4,Great job,"This c.d was breath taking the way she sings her voice is so soothing. The lyrics are so meaning full, and deep. They almost touch your soul in a way that is unverbal. If you are in a slump or haveing a bad time one of her songs will realate to your problem and help you throught it."
5,Mirrorball,I've been an ardent fan of Sarah McLachlan ever since my daughter gave me her Fumbling Through Ecstacy CD. Surfacing has been my other favorite until I recently purchased Mirrorball. Somehow her music in this live performance has a beauty not found in her studio recordings. There seems to be so much more feeling and intensity in the live music. Path of Thorns (Terms) and Hold On are two especially beautiful pieces. Listening to Hold On never brought tears to my eyes until I heard it sung in her Mirrorball CD. ENJOY!
1,"Just because ""Sarah"" is on the cover, doesn't mean it's good","Don't get me wrong: I love Sarah's music . . . but if she releases ANOTHER one of these live/outakes/remix/alternate versions CDs I'm going to pack it in . . .While this is being touted as a ""gift"" to fans, it's only a cheap way to direct money into her bank account.Half-baked performances, way too many ""WE LOVE YOU SARAH!""s from the audience . . . this is narcissism at its worse.Just because the name ""Sarah"" is on the cover, doesn't mean it's good."
1,a terrible album,dont get me wrong i like sarah i just dont like this cd. i mean where r all the songs from solace those are the real gems. also sarah has toured 4 times to support surfacing. 3 times at lilith fair and once on her own tour. she needs to write some new material. however there is a great version of ice cream on this cd.
5,I wil remember you is an awesome song,This CD is awesome and Sarah McLachlan rules. This CD really shows the tallents that she has! She rules!
5,Astounding,Sarah is the epitomy of music with feeling. She conveys the feelings and emotions in song in such a way that no other artist can. Mirrorball just further enhances the emotions by making them more of reality since it is a LIVE album. The best Live album yet!!!
1,New CD should = New songs,"Having already preordered I can honestly say that there are some great versions of old songs. I have all of Sarahs Cds', gone to Lilith Fair every year, and tuned into every TV show apperance. I would really appreciate a new CD that actually contained NEW songs. Please, please please, PLEASE, write a new album."
5,"Amazing, by my standards","This is my first Sarah McLachlan CD and I *loved* it. Everyone else says it's way more impersonal than her other CDs and live performances... I was shocked, because I thought it was just amazing how much emotion she puts into each word. So I can't wait to get her other CDs. But I think this one is great- and contrary to what everyone says, it makes a great first CD for a new McLachlan fan! The best songs on the disc are Building a Mystery, Adia, and Fear."
2,Mirrorball,I was disapointed in this product. This is the first CD I have ever purchased from this artist and felt the bit short changed.
1,very bland,"I was excited when this was first released, and now after giving it a longer listen, it is quite bland. I think I am more disappointed by it now then when I first bought it. Not her best, probably her worst. Stick with the early stuff, she has passed her prime."
2,What the heck!,"Man, what a let down, is Sarah ever going to release any new material? I was hoping to hear something that hasn't been commercialized upon yet, doesn't sarah think that she's made enough money off of these songs? Now we're not just gonna have to hear Angel on the radio every five minutes, but we're gonna have to hear a live version of it too? and c'mon people, I really like sarah's voice and her songs are well written, but a goddess? Sarah McLachlan is a woman just like any other woman, the difference between her and us is that her talent has been recognized and captured by the media/public, we are all as talented as her in some way or another, she just happened to take initiative and harness her future by getting herself in the right place at the right time with the right people that had enough money. Now that she's done that we put her on a pedastal and by living vicariously through her, we don't try to achieve it ourselves. Goddess indeed, woman I say! Grrrrr...."
2,Great Songs; BAD RECORDING,"I love listening to Sarah's songs, but this CD just really irked me. What's with the whisting, clapping, and screaming in the background? It was So annoying, it really ruins the mood and tune of the music. Instead of serenity, it was chaos. Blah...bad recording."
4,Captured a live concert very well,I enjoyed the CD. I do not own any other Sarah Mclachlan cd. But I probably will now. Her version of angel was beautiful. Her band is very good. Just a very very good cd.
5,She is a GEM!,"Having been a fan of Sarah's for a long time it is great to see that she is reaching a new and growing audience with each CD release (however long the period between them are). The selection of tracks is superb and really gives new listeners (like my sister!) a deep insight into her music from her previous albums, allowing them to see the genius us long time fans have been seeing since our first listen. I consider Mirrorball the best of the best off her two previous albums. Surfacing and Fumbling towards ecstasy. An outstanding live performer and an oustanding selection of songs make a this a CD a definite pleaser."
3,"""I Will Remember You"" was great but ""Angel"" was depressing!","It was an OK CD- I especially liked ""I Will Remember You"", but ""Angel"" was just so utterly depressing. It kept reminding me of my aunt who died, and it just made me all depressed. I think that song just totally spoiled the whole CD!"
5,One of the best live albums....,"Sarah McLachlan's voice has never been in doubt, but to hear her perform in front of a live audience is incredible. Living in England is awkward for seeing and hearing Sarah's music, but ""Mirrorball"" gives a great effect of how well she performs.The songs are radically different from their Solace/Fumbling/Surfacing formats but that just adds to the attraction of them.The audio quality of the CD is awesome, some live recordings are influenced too much by the audience, but that doesn't happen on here at all. FANTASTIC STUFF!!"
4,my two (unsolicited) cents,"i'm kinda disappointed that my favorite song-- ""Mary""-- isn't on there but you can't get them all. That said, what is on the cd is beautifully done and makes it well worth the wait."
5,Love It,A must for Sarah fans. First disk is superior to the second. All live versions of songs are unique and addictive.
5,Brillant live album!,"This album shows the deepness and evolution of Sarah's music, there are great tracks like ""Hold on"" (my favorite), and ""Do what you have to do"". One negative aspect of the album is the fade in-fade out break between songs, but the music is really incredible; Sarah have a great band! There are some forgotten songs like ""Vox"", ""Into the fire"", and ""I will forget you"", but I suppose I will have to buy the DVD....anyway buy this cd!"
2,disappointing,"as a person fairly interested in the music of ms. mclachlan and who plays over and over the song, ""ice cream,"" i was disappointed with this compiliation. i found it weak and flat and too easy listening-esque, almost department store tune-like and attempting to not discomfort any possible audience. i wanted more grit and femme, as sarah typically gives. try fumbling towards ecstasy instead."
3,All her best in one CD!!!!!,"The only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 is the fact that it is live and I don't like the noise of the crowd. The songs themselves are good, but I am not a fan of live recordings. I don't think I would have purchased this if I'd known it was live."
5,Five star.,Ahh Songs to leave is quite possibly my fave Forgotten Tomb album..I defiantly have this one as well as Negative Megalomania both killer albums if you like Suicidal Black Metal. \m/
5,Authentic as Little House on the Prairie,"Finding this book was one of life's pleasant surprises. There's no trace of self-pity, but Samuel does chronicle in great detail horrific events in the life of a young German refugee fleeing the Soviets in the wake of WWII. In the final analysis, what are the lessons of living on the edge of survival? This book provides a partial answer."
4,"Wonderful book, charming","This book is so much better then two other recent books I have read on Nazi Germany, 'Hitlers Niece' and 'The Good German'. Wonderfully written, well thought out and gives you a good understanding of the German and Russian, and the roll American played. The boys view on things was very charming and heartbreaking at times."
5,WQonderful first hand account,Wonderful and descriptive first hand account of living through WWII in Germany and the life there afterwards.
5,An inspiring account of a mother and two children to survive.,"This is a well written true story about a young German boy's account of the end of WWII in eastern Germany until 1951 with his mother and younger sister. Most Americans can't image survival living conditions for at least three years on near starvation rations, amid universal unemployment for adults. Add to this living in the Russian occupation zone of East Germany, a Stalinist regime run by German communists who survived the Nazi regime in 1945.If you thought the movie The Pianist was a great movie, this book would also make for an inspiring story of personal survival after the collapse of the Nazi regime in 1945. Highly recommended for all non-fiction readers."
5,"Excellent book, a must read!","I bought this book to give me some more insight into the world my mother saw in Germany as a teenager during and after the war. The book's descriptions of the conditions of the housing, food shortages, black market, and other parts of daily life are almost exactly some of the stories I heard from my mother - especially when the writer recounts going into already-harvested potato fields to find the small, deeply buried ones that were missed. This book is full of vivid detail like that- you are transported to a darker, sadder part of history that is almost forgotten.Interestingly, the book also gave me some insight into my Father's life - in poor rural Alabama during the Depression. A world away, but the same poverty, hunger, and in him a desire (like the writer of the book) for something better.My Father met my Mother in Germany, just before this book ends. It is a story about an incredible journey, and a desire for a better life."
5,A riveting MUST READ,"I could not put this book down. My mother (born 1934) was also a refugee from the Russians and fled with her famnily from East Germany to the west, then lived as a refugee in Goettingen with little more than the clothes on her back. Too many people naively think that once the war was over, life returned to normal. The suffering these people endured after the war is unimaginable in today's society. This book should be required reading for anyone studying modern European history or who believes that the war ended in 1945!!!"
3,good-not ovarly well translated-dull at times,"My Childhood was a good book. Not so easy to read, but an accurate discription of Russian life during the times. A picture of a world where cruelty plays a larger part than kindness. A small boy stuck between his grandparents and his wishes. Well writen, and a must have for litrature students. My Childhood was an interesting read..."
1,Don't waste your money,"My daughter has ezxema and i needed organic cotton bibs, so I bought these. First the lining ,which makes contact with her skin, is polyester and that wasn't mentioned in description. Second after two washings the product has begun go completely fall apart. A terrible product!"
2,Frays in the wash,"I am so disappointed that these bibs are fraying and pulling quite a bit after only 3 washings. The binding is not overlapping the main fabric enough on one of them, which is already making a big 1"" gap that is fraying. The tags are fraying, and the terrycloth has many ""pulls"" where the yarn loops have pulled out to 1/2"" and 2"" long strings, making the once adorable bibs look very scrappy. I have washed with the Velcro fastened in regular cycle warm and tumble dry on medium heat. I'll give 2 stars because they are so cute and soft."
2,Inconsistent materials,"I received a set of bibs with a trim made of a different fabric than the rose satin pictured--it's a pink and white flowered print in a non-satiny fabric. I also have this set in sage green, which came with the pictured satin fabric. The green satin trim completely frayed in the wash and pulled away from the terry cloth as other reviews have described. Oddly, the white satin bibs are just fine. While I'm happy with the way the rose set has held up over the past 3 months, I wouldn't order this product again because the quality has been so inconsistent. If I received another set with satin trim, I would send it back immediately."
2,fraying trim,agree with the other reviews that the satin trim is falling apart and fraying after only a couple washes. would not buy again
3,"Okay, but not the Best","If you can save money by buying the looseleaf version of this text, then do it. I rarely used it for class, but I was taking an online course. I also am a biology major, so most of this information was stuff I'd learned a long time ago in intro to bio, or anatomy and physiology. There is also not much of a difference between this text, and the next edition, so whichever one you can get in the looseleaf version, do that."
5,Fast!,"I ordered this book on a tuesday and got it that friday! It was amazing how fast it got here. Good condition, no marks and no writting in the book!"
1,MADE IN CHINA,"Not sure what I was thinking buying this in the first place. Made in China, the guitar's action from the neck is ABNORMALLY high. No matter how broken in the strings were, it quickly lost its tuning. All around piece of junk, I guess you get what you pay for. Do not buy."
2,Strap continually fell off my heel,"I wear size 9 1/2- 10 wide. These shoes were the perfect look, although a little bright of a silver. I wore these to a wedding and the strap kept falling off my heel. In between the wedding and reception, we stopped at a CVS and I purchased those Dr. Schols silicone grip strips, but even with those the the strap refused to stay on. I was hugely disappointed.I wear wide mostly for my toe box and perhaps my heel is normal size and that may be why they were too big. Still there was a small elastic section on the strap, which should have made it automatically adjust to my heel size, but the elastic was not very springy. Sort of stretched out.One more thing if you wore these without stockings they may work for you. However, for me silver is a winter holiday type choice and I would never go without nylons in the winter."
2,Narrow!,"Shoes were very narrow even though they were marked as wide. The shoes themselves were very nice and arrived on time, I just wish they fit."
4,MOST STYLISH NATURALIZER YET!,I HAVE BEEN A NATURALIZER FAN FOR YEARS AND I MUST SAY THIS IS MY MOST STYLISH NATURALIZER TO DATE. BESIDES THE RELIABLY COMFORTABLE FIT THIS SHOE SEAMLESSLY GOES FROM DRESSY DAY WEAR TO IDEAL COCKTAIL SHOE AFTER WORK.I HAVE BOUGHT THE BLACK AND GOLD AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OTHER COLOUS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOE. AMAZON PRESENTLY HAS A 19.89 DEAL THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE AS WELL (I UNFORTUANTLEY PAID A LOT MORE IN APRIL ON AMAZON).
3,Too narrow,"Very pretty shoes, but the wide size was still too narrow for my (wide) feet. I had to return them."
3,"Promising, but too narrow","This is one of the ONLY styles of dress sandals in existence with a flexible rubber sole, so I was pretty excited about them. They are very pretty, and felt like they would be stable to walk and dance in, but they were too narrow. They were not available in wide width in my size, so back they go. Too bad!"
4,Good field guide,"This field guide is really usefull. It has a basic description of hte animals, plants, geology, insects, and weather of the Southwest."
1,Not recieved,I ordered this for a trip to Arizona on the 17th of May and have still not received it and it is the 18th of June- My trip is nearly over :(
4,A very useful field guide.,This is a very useful field guide. I found it quite helpful on a recent trip. It is well organized.
3,good for hobbist,I purchased this book in connection to doing my field research for my thesis. I had planned to use it to help identify plants in a burn area. It was almost completely useless to me. The photographs where too small to clearly identify plants and they where fuzzy at times so you could not identify the object you where looking at. The description of plants where brief but unclear about where they are other then which state. Trust me when you are looking at grasses it helps to know that they are in a certain elevation at least. I was able to use it for identifying only two plants and a few animals but otherwise it was just a weight in my backpack.If you want an easy book for a day hike so you can id a few plants and animals this is your book but if you want something for serious work don't purchase this. I am so glad I purchased other field guides and this was my back up.
5,Southwest Comprehensive,Just returned from a tour of the Southwest. The field guide was easy to use. I liked the fact that it covered so many aspects of the Southwest and eliminated having to tote five or six field guides to cover most of the subject matter.
4,Good Fiction,This was a good book if you like to think fairy tales come true. As romantic fiction it brings in the occult to help the love life happen.
5,Ask Mariah,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters were interesting, and the plot was well developed. I especially liked the way the children used the crystal ball to help solve the mystery. I loved the ending."
5,Loved it!,This book was such a great read! I could not put it down and read it in just a couple days. It was an easy read and enjoyable for sure! Kept you thinking throughout the book and ended happily. Great book for light reading...definitely recommend it!
3,Selective silence by 6-year-olds??,"Although the writing was enjoyable and the characters were fairly worthy of regard, it is impossible to believe that 6-year-old twins could completely and consistently avoid talking to their father for a year (I have twins so I know of what I speak!). That is even less likely than ""Mariah"", the glass globe that gives advice; so over-all the story rests on premises that can not be believed, and, unfortunately, they are paramount to the plot. It's too bad because the story of an unknown sister who is dead and her effect on those around her really had possibilities. I guess I just can't buy into the fantasy required to fully enjoy this book."
4,nice read,"nice summer read. my only compliant would be the contant mention of the name ""de luca"". there was no mention of joanna's biological mother family name? petty, i know. good story overall!!"
1,terrible treatment of adoption,"Although i usually find Freethy's books entertaining, I was disgusted by her terrible treatment of the adoption process. She joined the sensationalists that go overboard trying to make a very good thing into something with all bad consequences. If I could deduct stars from the rating, I would."
4,Ask Mariah,I really did enjoy this book. It's easy to read and understand and makes you feel like you're a part of this family and you want to help too! I wanted to just hold the twins and take them home with me! Ha!
5,great read,One of the first books that I read by Barbara Freethy. She keep me turning the pages. I have purchased a lot of her books.
3,Cute and lite,A nice lite read....Interesting....Good to pick up. As with most of her books entertaining. Easy reading and interesting ...Good feel
4,Ask Mariah,I haven't finished it yet with the holidays so busy. I am almost done and do like it altho sometimes I had trouble noing who was who but figured it out. I would read another book by Barbara Freely
4,Ask Mariah,"It's by Barbara Freethy, what could not be good about it? I have enjoyed all of the books I have read by her."
1,WHAT IS THIS?,This seems like a DVD with three María Félix films but the description does not provide the titles so it's impossible to know what the hell you are buying. The graphic included is so small you can't read what it says. Obviously you are better off running away from this lousy product.
1,Awful!,This was so stupid & corny that I couldn't even stand to watch the whole thing. Even for 99 cents it's a complete waste of money :/
5,Mine!,"Are you tired of missing this movie's air time on TV because of work or school? I was! That's why I bought it, now I can watch it whenever I want :)"
5,Great Version of It's A Wonderful Life,The added features and bio are a really nice addition to a Christmas classic. It is a great Christmas tradition.
2,This movie SUCKS!,"I am extremely concerned about the populous in the United States. Despite the acting and holiday cheer, this movie sucks. Its feel good message is just a reminder of how white america can struggle through all of its problems and eventually end up with the beautiful wife and 2.5 kids behind a white picket fence with friendly neighboors. It is particularly disgusting when Stewart explores his own non-existence to find his wife to be a pathetic librarian that has no life to fill without being married. I am mentally repulsed at the ""father knows best"" themes that have permeated all of our psyche's I say boycott this movie and start fighting the man that tries to shove it down with your throat. Viva Anima!!"
5,It's About Time!!,"The following is an excerpt from my personal Video catalogue. I originally saw the movie in Toronto, Canada soon after it was first released and I never could understand why it wasn't received with much more acclaim (I am 74 years of age).But to quote from my catalogue: ""A man who has become terribly despondent because of a financial difficulty inadvertently thrust upon him by his uncle, contemplates suicide but is ""saved"" by his guardian angel who grant's him his wish of not ever having been born. It took the viewing public more than THIRTY years to appreciate this Frank Capra masterpiece.The name, James Stewart and the character he portrayed, George Bailey became synonymous.The supporting cast, with names like Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, H.B.warner, Ward Bond, Frank Faylen,Samuel S. Hinds and the ""angel' Henry Travers was superb.A remake was made about 1978 with a female counterpart of George Bailey. Whatever became of it?"
5,It's a wonderful life,Exactly what we wanted. It's a Wonderful Life in color.It's was what my husband wanted. He enjojed it very much.
4,A Wonderful Movie!,"Despite Frank Capra's movies being termed ""Capracorn"" by Hollywood cynics, this and others by Capra are wonderful, uplifting movies, for those who enjoy being uplifted. It's a staple at Christmas time along with Miracle on 34th Street (the one with Edmund Gwen), Scrooge, the Bishop's Wife and others."
4,Love The Movie But...,"The format of the DVD has me bit puzzled. When I opened the package I noticed that it was a two sided disc. I thought this was because there was a wide-screen and a regular format to the film. But when I looked closer I realized that the supplemental material is on the second side. I know that it did not need to be done this way, so I'm curious why they made it so. This is only a minor annoyance though on an otherwise wonderful and funny movie.I would buy it again, even if I hate having to flip the disc over to see the extra materials."
5,Perfect,"Does not strip your hair, leaves it shiny but clean. it's perfect for everyday use. The shampoo is not overpowering, and is concentrated so only a small amount is necessary."
5,Hip and savvy take on twenty-something life,"Wow! What a great pleasure it was to stumble upon this book. A very comfortable, easy read, that was both edgy and relevant to anyone in their early twenties (even if you aren't a girl). The book's honesty with emotions and accurate portrayals of the everyday is anything but ordinary. It's like Ghost World meets Bridget Jones meets Real World, well sorta. I couldn't put it down!"
5,"The Most Relaxing ""The Natural Piano II""","This is one of the best cd's I have listened to for combining relaxation and nature sounds. From the waves of the ocean to the call of the loon, this music calms and soothes the soul of anyone who loves music and nature. I would highly recommend this cd!"
5,Souvenir 1989-1998 The Rankins,Fare Thee Well Love is my absolute favorite and The Rankins are the absolute best at singing it. A fantastic group of beautiful voices~!!!
3,Ripped off?,"I saw this paperback movie tie-in last night and grabbed it.I love Jane and am looking forward to the film. I've read anumber of bios of Jane over the years and this one looksinteresting.However, I have to give a thumbs down to the publisher.Where are the illustrations that are clearly listed inthe text? The author obviously included them in theoriginal edition, but they are gone from this one.When I pay $15 for a book, even a paperback, I expectto get the WHOLE book, illustrations included. Thepaperback edition of ""Queen Isabella"" by Allison Weir,which was about the same price, included ALL theillustrations from the original, and in color! Sowhat's the deal with Continuum? I'd return the book.except I still want to read it. Maybe I'll get itout of the library and see what I'm missing!"
3,Biographical fact. Not like the movie.,"Spence gets Austen's life to us in a dry, factual way. The movie took these facts, put them in a blender, embellished, and made a wonderful flick. However, if you wanted to get this book as a read of the movie, you're out of luck. Hollywood SHOULD get their facts straight. I don't blame Spence for that. He just lucked out that someone took his book, gave him money, meanwhile making a lovely (if quite fictitious) 'based on' biography."
1,"Long on speculation, short on facts","One of weakest books on Austen and one I thoroughly disliked. Spence supposes a vast litany of events that he writes as if did happen to Austen, when in fact most are sheer supposition based on extremely feeble evidence if any at all.It really is not a tragedy that Austen didn't ever marry, but it is a tragedy that her genius must be attributed to the influence of someone like Tom Lefroy."
3,reads like a family tree,"I am a jane fan, this book reads like a family tree. Some parts are interesting, but not like i thought it would be."
4,Becoming Jane Austen,The book had so many characters that it was hard to follow. Thank goodness it had a geonogoly chart because I kept referring back to it so I could figure out where each person fit into Jane's life.
5,It Doth Give Much Pleasure,"My only regret is that I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it outright. Author Jon Spence has done a remarkable job in detailing Jane Austen's life, and there are many interesting tidbits that bring you closer to the mind of this 19th century writer. What strikes me most is Spence's knack for fluid detail with words that capture from the start. He presents an excellent account of the times Austen lived in and an organized melody of her personal life from letters she wrote to her sister Cassandra. Spence obviously did his homework, and we are fortunate to have her life viewed as if we were a fly on the wall. If you only read one book on Austen, make it this one."
3,"A romantic view of Jane Austen, if not the most well-supported","A biography with a hint of ""dramatic interpretation"". I enjoyed it, although I thought many of the author's assertions were a stretch. Unfortunately, the evidence is so fragmentary that we will never really know about some of Jane Austen's life. Spence's main contention is that she had a failed romance with Tom Lefroy, which dominated her heart and her literary imagination for the rest of her life. I thought it was a romantic notion, and I liked the fictionalized movie based on this book, but I think there is not enough evidence to say with such conviction. Too bad her sister destroyed most of Jane's letters after her death or we might have actually known."
4,"A little cheesy, but stellar fretwork","This style of music is sort of a guilty pleasure, but the speed is blazing and some of the music is really awe inspiring. If I could play half as well as this guy... well then I would be able to play about 20 times better than I can now..."
5,amazing album,"this is an amazing album both musically and in guitar virtuosity. i love the idea of shred in a classical foundation, and malmsteen knows how to pull it off beautifully!"
5,A PROG ROCK/METAL GEM!,This album is an absolute gem in the genre of prog metal. Virtuoso guitar throughout and excellent playing by all members of the band. Touches of classical music interspersed with rock make this a highly recommended prog rock album. I wish that it were all instrumental though. But there are only two vocal cuts on the whole C.D.
5,Reminiscence or Reality?,"The first time, I had my hands on this album was 1985, I was in grad 9. The first impression I had back then, something like, ""How many people are playing guitars here?"" Due to my ignorance in guitar instruments, I thought that least ten people were playing guitars simultaneously in this album; I thought ""No one man can do this by himself.""17 years have gone by, this funny memory not only makes me laugh today, but also it has become a part of my life.Before, I die, if someone to ask me what brings me a happiness in my life, then I will say, ""my guitar, and few other things(I don't need to specify, because those are not related to this review).""I have never met Yngwie, but I must say,""All my gratitude is yours"". My long journey with guitar embarked with this album. I'm still in that journey. So, if someone to ask me, ""Is it reminiscence or reality?"", then I know what the answer is."
1,not up to date,"this kind music is dying nowi own this cd and its good for the 80's but shred and showing skill doesnt make people like your music, thats why yngwie never become a good musician"
1,8 people have ears 90 do not! what a surprise!,"Scales and Arpeggios are not music. There is a concept known as melody. Melody is a series of note choices which create a dialog and tell a story. Call and response, tension and release. Yngwie sounds like a hyperactive cocaine induced nightmare. the lightning fast mediocre technique of an adolecent which could ""SHOW PROMISE"" if, it weren't for his condition. I believe they give Ritalin to AD/HD disorder. Giving him a dose high enough might pose a health risk, although, It is a risk humanity deserves. The real sad part is not his awful playing, but, the droves of non-classically trained people who are fascinated by his garbage offerings. How sad that an ego so large is perplexed by what is generally considered the centerpiece of any musical composition. MELODY. - JB"
3,Same old same old,"Been there. Heard it. When's something new coming around? Sorry, Yngwie, but I need something I can sink my teeth into. All this album seems to do for me is make me want to either play Castlevania or listen to Dream Theater and Arcturus to wash the gunk from my ears. This used to be sooooo innovative. But now I realize it's all parlor tricks and pentatonics. Sure, I'll give Yngwie props for his talent. Hardly ANYONE alive today can actually *play* scales as fast as he can, but is this never ending argument about either speed or talent? Uh huh, thought so. I'll give the man three stars for his talent alone. But my problem with his music is as much the same as my problem with Les Claypool of Primus, everything's repetitive and mostly parlor tricks. Ah well, to make it up to Amazon.com, I'll suggest you buy other products of theirs, like Dream Theater, Marillion, etc. Also, if you want talent, look no further than Meshuggah. Thank you."
5,The greatest guitar recording of ALL TIME.,"For those of you uninitiated, guitar gods are individuals who specialize in technical prowess, speed and innovation when it comes to playing the guitar. Some gods include Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, John Pretrucci, Jimi Hendrix, etc. But none of these individuals compare to the one and only Yngwie Johann Malmsteen, and this is mainly because of this release, Rising Force.Rising Force is definitely the ""bible"" to neo-classical guitar rock, and many people have attempted to copy Yngwie's style, but few can replicate his UNMATCHED speeds and UNTOUCHABLE vibrato skills. His arpeggiated broken chord progressions are technically difficult and musically stimulating. Black Star and Far Beyond The Sun are my favourite songs and are likely the most technical as well, though the entire album ruins all of the competition. Seriously consider purchasing this recording.5 stars. More than 5 stars if I had the choice..."
2,Jittery altitudes,"2 1/2Brought down by its passionate tribute to all things corny in eighties metal, instrumental passages nonetheless can often transcend their cheesy confines."
3,The best of heavy-metal fret-shredding,"Starting with the legendary Les Paul, many electric guitar fret-shredders have come and gone but few have made good music and this album by Malmsteen is the last one worthy of consideration.It is a fusion of heavy-metal guitar and classical forms and at times remarkably similar to Al Di Meola's fusion album Elegant Gypsy (just listen to ""Race with the Devil on Spanish Highway"").But as fret-shredders before him have learned blazing speed and energy don't guarantee good music.In the end, this album represents the height of heavy-metal rock guitar virtuosity, composition, and introduced heavy-metal to fusion. But it still carries the heavy-metal traits of being forced and contrived."
3,"OK, but not Malmsteen's best shredding","I would consider myself a casual fan of Yngwie, and guitar shredders rarely make it into my CD collection at all. Rising Force contains some quality playing and interesting song structures, but I feel that it is artistically dated at this point. Yngwie became a much better player in later years, and seeing him in the G3 DVD was mind-blowing. Going from that to Rising Force made it easy to see his improvement. The album is a classic for guitarists, but the guitar work is clearly not up to par with Malmsteen's more recent material (which is really a good thing when you think about it). Also, the production seems rather mediocre and muffled, making the potentially exciting songs sound dead. Basically, if you're a big Yngwie fan, you'll want it, but if you just want to hear some amazing playing, go for his stuff at G3 instead."
4,ORIGINAL RELEASE !,"Very original, it set the pattern for a lot o ""copiers"" to follow. It has a lot of instrumental tunes, very good, and the ones which features Scott Soto are great , also."
5,The BEST from the Maestro,"I've owned ""Rising Star"" since late 80's and I just can't stop listening to it. In fact I am listening to ""Black Star"" as I am writing this review. Yngwie is not only the greatest guitar player but he is also a great composer. This album is his best one in my and many Malmsteen fans. Just go ahead and buy it, the sound will make you want to fly or cry, it is so touching to the heart.Yngwie, if you read this, we're waiting for you in Detroit."
2,Technique does NOT make good music,"I am a guitarist, and I can vouch for Malmsteen's astounding technique. However, that only takes you so far. The songs should come first, and the songwriting just isn't there. Endless solos get boring and old after a while. You can either play for other guitar players to show off how fast you can go wheedily wheedily whee up and down the fretboard, or you can write songs and solos that hit people in the gut and touch their hearts.In my opinion, Malmsteen had an overwhelmingly NEGATIVE influence on rock guitar in the 80's. It became a competition. So many players were worried about speed and technique rather than composition and playing from their souls. As another reviewer said, if you want emotional instrumental guitar music, pick up a Eric Johnson or a Joe Satriani cd instead."
3,Influential guitar work,"Yngwie set the mold for many of the progressive rock guitarists to come in the following years. This is the best example of his work. Even so, the people that came after him have topped him in every way imaginable. He may be fast, but his playing is very formulaic and lacks personality or style. Guitarists like Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, and Steve Vai (among many others) have done things far more impressive then Malmsteen could have dreamed of. Still, if you're looking for some of the most influential guitar work, check this album out, mainly for the solos on Far Beyond The Sun and Black Star."
4,A gentle coming-of-age story,"I first discovered Scarlett Thomas when I read ""The End of Mr Y"", which has to be my favorite novel of the last five years. I've been working my way through everything she's written, and ""Going Out"" is number three for me. It's a very pleasant read, with a small dose of the kind of wacky existential philosophy which made Mr. Y such a good read, and plenty of well-observed characters from unfashionable Essex who I'm sure are very close to Ms Thomas's heart.I find her novels to be deliciously escapist, and full of pop-culture references: who on the internet could forget that ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"" makes such a good alternative soundtrack for ""The Wizard of Oz""?I'd recommend any of her novels, even those I've not read yet ..."
3,Yellow Roads,"Contrary to the editorial review, I'm a ""Gen Xer"" and very much appreciated this book's nostalgia. The story is as unrealistic as they come, but quite entertaining. Thomas did a fine job with the characters. And the Wizard of Oz touch was very charming."
3,"Cute story, likable characters","Likeable, quirky, twenty-something, English characters trying to find their way, by deciding to go on a Wizard of Oz type quest.Thomas writes odd and honest characters in a way that exposes truths about being human, while keeping the narrative light and fast paced.I read her book Popco, too and will check out whatever else she writes."
5,Bumpin',If you like tight tracks and bumpin'beats this is for you. Go buy this Down South album. Scarface really bumped on this joint.
3,the king of the south put it down,"one fairly good compilation especially the cuts by face,will,ugk,hot boys,devin,3-6 mafia,big mike,5th ward boyz,goodie,breed and ace duece.this should have been a one cd compilation because the artist i didn't name put in half a#$ efforts"
1,Conrad's War,This book stinks. Conrad is EXTREMLY disrespectful to his father and this book is awful.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ...,"The book was preety bad and boring. I read it at school, with all the class.All the class hated it. It is boring and predectible. Richard Bach is a better choice."
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"THIS IS A MUST BUY,BILLY SHEHAN IS TOP NOTCH.IF YOUR A ROCK AND ROLL FAN,THIS WILL BE AN EXCELLENT CD FOR YOU COLLECTION.THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Mr Big couldn't dodge the ""grunge"" bump","The ""bump"" that lay ""ahead"" every skilled/unskilled, established/unestablished rock act in the early 1990s was ""grunge."" Mr. Big, was a skilled band, who, like many others, tweaked their sound towards the grungier side. This album has a muddier sound, and the rockers have a moodier, ""bluesier"" feel. The ballads (they have one too many here) are rather flat. The musical originality that defined Lean Into It is absent. Just think about the mind-boggling, ear-pleasing guitar intro to the Green Tinted sixties Mind or the adrenalin inducing ""Luck This Time."" Nothing like those on this record. With their next album ""Hey Man"" the band delved deeper into the abyss of grunge and got lost."
1,"junk, keep looking","I bought this heated blanket for my wife as a gift. Don't make the same mistake. It works so poorly that we're thinking about sending it back. The heat is very weak, and concentrated in only a couple spots. The power attachment is poorly designed and when the blanket is moved around at all it detaches very easily. Low quality all around. I had a Sunbeam before (dog chewed up the power cord) and had better luck with that one."
1,BARELY WARM,"has the mildest heating effect you could ever have and legally call a blanket. terrible ,terrible product, stay away!"
2,Dont bother,"Bought 2 of these on sale for a good price. Used them both a few times a week for less than 4 months and they both went out. First the light went out, no big deal, then the heating went out soon there after. They didnt even last a whole season. They were great so far as staying heated and stayed very warm, which is the only reason I gave the second star. You would be better off spending more money for a better brand."
4,Color is not Accurate,"I bought this electric blanket on Amazon and over all it's great electric blanket. One thing to be aware of is that the color in the picture is not at all accurate. I bought the burgandy blanket, in the picture this appears to have light pink, magenta et cetera tones wit some dark black or brown areas. When I received the blanket I was a bit disappointed to realize it was bright red with some green. So just be aware, the picture isn't at all what it looks like.Other than that, it works fine, it's soft and comfortable though it does shed a bit and I get red pieces of fuzz on my floor and on furniture I use it on."
5,Works great!,This blanket warms up quickly and is very soft and comfy. My only reqret is that I saw it at Big Lots for half the price after I'd already received and used mine!
4,Nice travel tool,"Everything about this tool is as advertised. The wrench heads are made of a high quality material and the tool provides plenty of torque. This tool is perfect for the road/emergency because it eliminates extra weight and works great. However, if you are doing bike maintenance in your garage, I would recommend getting regular tools as swapping out the heads for different locations is very tedious."
5,Best Cleanser I have ever used...,"This is by far the best face cleanser I have ever used. It leaves my face clean and soft, not dry or course. It seems a little expensive for this small bottle, but actually this amount will last me almost a year!! You only have to use a tiny amount on your finger and it foams up and cleans like it is a handful of cleaner. I love this so much, I actually bought it and gave it to my friends as a Christmas gift and now they are hooked as well!It is absolutely worth the money and I won't use anything else on my face. Enjoy!!"
3,If You Want Your Face Oil Free You Got It,"In the extreme sense of the words ""oil free"" it'll certainly do that. It'll take the oils off your hands in the shower when you wash with it. Now, my skin needs are not so extreme that I need this level of drying it out, but I can see where some might. It does as promised, though it just wasn't right for me, it'll dry out the skin. If you have combination skin like I do or seasonal (during the summer) excess oily, this isn't the product for you. This is something one with serious oil issues uses."
4,Great cleanser for combo skin,"Though it smells a bit funny, it makes my skin feel clean and refreshed, and I haven't noticed any break outs. I would recommend it."
1,Did I Read the Same Book as Everyone Else?,"I'm beginning to think I must have read a different book than everyone else. I'm not sure how anyone could give this book any kind of rave reviews. I've read some wretched literary endeavors in my time and this certainly ranks up there with the worst. Reading it was like trudging up a mountain through hundreds of feet of snow. By Chapter 4 I was ready to weep with boredom. The dialogue is hideously written. Honestly, my 6 year old could come up with more imaginative conversations than E. Lynn Harris. My money could certainly have been spent better elsewhere."
2,less average (2-2.5 stars),"I can't say enuff 'bout this but I thought it was a novel that has to deal w/ life of something like from famous black authors of Richard Wright to Langston Hughes to Ralph Ellison or somethin like that. I believe it's a ok book even tho I don't read it very oftenly all the time 'cuz it deals w/ the situations between HIV/AIDS, sex and celibacy. First of all I never read a sex book in my life. I thought it was cool but it goes to tell you how to beware about the diffrence bout the good side vs. the bad side of sex. I'ma think I'll keep it 'round a lil longer or so. Good work E. Lynn Harris."
4,Men in love,"Men in love is so powerful,this book made me think that it could be just as deep as a women and a man"
3,"A good read, BUT...","After reading Invisible Life I couldn't wait to read Just as I am. I enjoyed it, BUT I thought Nicole was unrealistic, way to naive and Jared sounds gay to me. Overall I enjoyed the book and recommend it."
4,Tear Jerker,If you need a good cry this is the one you need. The character in this book become a part of your life while you're reading it! You'll find yourself wondering what's going on with Kyle while the book isn't in your hands. E. Lynn Harris has done a great job with this one. Enjoy!
5,Just As I Am,This book was just as good as the first one. It gave explicit details about the relationships going on in this book. I was happy to know what happened to the character in this book b/c I was left hanging from the first book. Also I can not wait until he writes another one.
1,Ridiculously juvenile!,"I am truly stupefied that anyone found this book anything more than dry and pretentious.These characters are so underdeveloped and superficial I was able to read as a completely detached observer.The dialogue is contrived and stilted,and there is no unity in the narrative of the story:the chapters could well be excerpts from any of 100 different books...but let's at least be glad there aren't 100 other similar books out there. I sympathize with the author's sense of urgency in revealing the angst of the gay male of African origin,and that of AIDS sufferers, but an essay on the same would have been a more humane experience than this juvenile short story that E. Lynn Harris tries to pass off as adult literary fiction!"
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT","The book is great. The way Harris describes the characters, you feel like you actually know them. You must read ""Invisible Life"" first and then ""Just As I Am."" When you stop reading for a second, your mind gets to wandering what is going to happen next."
2,Unfocused Infomercial Style Hodge Podge,"This is a over produced video that spends endless time spouting unorganized generalities and truisms without a sound structure. There are great video clips that are beautiful and sometimes funny, but do not enforce the topic being discuss. The coaches interviews are very good, but there are no graphics or data to support or illustrate what is being said, just endless ski videos and beauty shots mixed with the coach staring into the camera. For example, the coach talks about the heart and they show a vivid picture of a heart, but don't indicate anything in the picture related to the coaches comments.There is a lot of information in this video, but pulling meaning out of it and using it is not possible unless you already fully understand training concepts.The lack of organization in this video left me frustrated and unable to finish it.Save your money"
3,Like special effects ?,All I could find were special effects.I never found the 9 hours of instruction.Why does an instructional video need to belike MTV?
4,Tajai's album delivers what your hoping for.,"This is yet another excellent effort from Hieroglyphics. Hiero is the BEST kept secret in hip hop. I believe that this album is what Hiero, and fans of Hiero, have been looking for. The sencerity of the album allowed the collaboration of many co-producers to put down some really nice beats along with Tajai's ability to make any beat snap. (Track #2, ""raindance"" is a masterpiece). Best album from Hieroglyphics since Del's ""Both Sides of The Brain."" And I have to dig all the way back to Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Return to the 36 Chambers"" album to think of a release so completely original without missing the point."
1,Terrible solo effort from TAJAI !,"This is a all around terrible album by Tajai. The tracks are all basically garbage on here & I just really wasnt feeling this one. I hope that he does not put out another solo album because I won't even give it a chance after this album. His mixtape Sleeping Giant is good since it has a ton of guest mc's on it so you figure that one out. I just dont think that he can hold a album together all on his own. I've been listening Hiero crew since i was about 14, so i will give this album a pass. Avoid this cd at all cost! Just download track #7 The Dum Dum. Only dope joint on this one. If you are a new Hiero fan check out 93' til Infinity and 3rd Eye Vision to start off with."
3,Bad choice for a single,"This is a horrible choice for a single from Mo Thugs' ""IV: The Movement."" It not only is entirely [thankfuly] unrepresentative of the rest of the album, but is a sad attempt at capitalizing on the sucess of [bad] love songs from Ja Rule and Ashanti/<insert female artist here>. But instead, it is Felecia and Layzie Bone. The concept is beyond played out and it is generic as can get. Luckily, Layzie Bone can actually sing as opposed to Ja Rule. But talent does it make a song. It's what you do with your talent.Get the actual album, as there is much better stuff on there than on this single. The tracklisting on the CD single does not even match up with the the actual songs: there are 4 songs, not three, and there is no ""remix"", but simply a version with just the chorus and some of the background vocals.A much better choice for a single would have been ""Do Your Thang"" by Felecia, Krayzie Bone and Layzie Bone or ""Can You Dig It"" by Layzie Bone and Thin C"
4,suprisingly good,Theres 2 parts. Singing and rapping. Layzie Bone raps and some other lady in Mo Thugs sings. Layzie lays down a tight fast flow as usual and the singing sounds good. This sounds different than a regular Bone Thugs/Mo Thugs song but its a really nice duet between the 2.
2,OK but eh,"Metal quality fine but they are sloppy in hold and ""flop"" on the board. Cheap enough not to return but not enough to recommend."
4,A Good Read,Dr. Pinion's experiences and research come through in his book. He has pinpointed significant reasons why pastors leave the ministry. An especially good read for the lay leader in the church
2,"Descriptive, Not Prescriptive","As a pastor for over 20 years, I could relate to almost everything the author was sharing. The problem was that it sounded more like a journal of complaints or warnings for those who might dare enter ministry than a book designed to help ""crushed"" ministers. It's a great book if you want to have your ""crushed"" feelings validated, but it's not so great if you are looking for practical help out. I kept thinking, ""Yes, you're right! Now give me some suggestions as to how I can deal with being so ""crushed."" It never happened."
4,Mtn Hardwear Enterprise,"Besides being well made and looking over-the-top cool, this pack was designed with a pretty sweet array of externally accessible pockets. The compression straps are a plus, and the shoulder strap design is very comfortable. The only thing I would change is a little beefier top carry handle strap. It is probably more than adequate (and the additional carry handle at mid pack is a home run), but I think it's a missed opportunity in terms of an overall indestructible appearance.For a large capacity day pack, laptop/notebook pack, or carry-on I believe this would rank pretty high for anybody."
5,Mountain Hardwear Enterprise Backpack,"This is a great backpack. Everyone in my family has one. Each a different color. It holds our computer safely, and has plenty of room for all the accessories, including a few extras! Very sturdy and made well. A good choice!"
2,Incomplete,"Six songs including one which badly overstays its welcome do not make a classic album. However, Presence Of The Lord is one classic piece with one of the best guitar solos of Eric Clapton's career. Can't Find My Way Home and Sea Of Joy are two other nice understated pieces. However, there is way too much limited material for this record to be worth anyhing more than a bargain bin purchase!"
3,One album that should have been two.,"The only problem with this album was that it doesn't offer the listener the option to make a choice--a song album or a jam album. They should have put out one primary album with the new short tracks added in the fashion of a lot of re-released older albums (but with either version of ""Sleeping In the Ground""--not both), then issued another one at a discount with just the five jams (they could have fit all five on a 74-minute disc very nicely) for people who wanted to add that material to their library. Maybe just call it ""Five Jams). The resulting total price of the two could be the same as the price for this set, but it would have let people who are bored by riffing off the hook--both Clapton and Winwood have developed followings in their respective solo careers who can't stand 12-minute numbers which are almost entirely instrumental. Who weren't around for the ""Spoonful"" Clapton or the Winwood who helped Hendrix with ""Voodoo Chile"" the way I was."
5,"Great Recording, but Ginger Overrated","This is one of the greatest rock recordings of all time. I know it, critics know it, history has proven it. Listen to it and you will know it, too. As for the person who agrees with Clapton that Ginger Baker is the best drummer of all time, sorry. Baker is good, not great. Clapton said that in agreement with Baker (who does have the greatest ego of all time), because he was working with him at the time. Anyone who seriously thinks Baker is the best has apparently never heard Buddy Rich, Keith Moon, Ray Fean, or at least a hundred others."
3,Jammed into oblivion.,"Most people who purchase this ""remastered, DELUXE edition"" will probably already have a copy of the original LP/CD. That was a generally fine recording, as evidenced by the numerous existing reviews. But this is pure overblown nonsense. The many included extended ""jams"" go absolutely nowhere, except ""Boredom & Tedium City"".To add insult to expensive injury, my Mobile Fidelity Gold Disc is actually a cleaner and more dynamic remastering than this one. Save your money, then try to track down the MoFi."
3,Don't pay more - No hidden jems here - Buy the orginal CD,"I have the orginal CD, and would rate that *****. I was excited when I saw that I would be able to buy unreleased versions and jams from this album's sessions; however, there is nothing worth releasing! Amazing! How could the orginal be so good, and there not even be one more song, version or jam worth releasing. Even the jams are not jams - I was at least hoping to hear Clapton in the various jams, but those ended up being very boring, repetitious and monotomous headaches, with Clapton playing same cords for 10 minutes."
4,great promise; too rushed,"The promise of this ""supergroup"" was never fully realized. Under tremendous pressure to produce an album, they actually produced five really good songs and almost one whole side (LP jargon there) of filler in ""Do What You Like."" Considering the strength of the rest of the album, this obvious filler seemed like a slap in the face then, and seems even more so today. That's too bad. If they had been given the time to write and produce an entire album's worth of quality material, this album might have the same weight in Clapton's cannon as Layla. And that's really saying something."
5,Never Again,"Interesting reading the reviews. I wonder how many of the people who submitted reviews heard the album for the first time in 1969. You had to be there to appreciate the affect it had on you amid the tumultuous times. It is impossible to take these albums out of the times they were first heard. I admit I am biased because I heard the songs for the first time live, even though it was in Bridgeport, CT. Guess what I bought the next day, then the CD and then the MP3 for my iPod. While I'm in the middle of a workout at the gym listening to Blind Faith, my mind is in Bridgeport, CT, now that's what great music is all about and this group made a great album. Obviously, I'm not a music critic but I know what I like. Will a rap fan enjoy this CD? Probably not, but that's their loss."
5,Blind Faith cd,"If you remember ""Blind Faith"", you'll love it as you did when it was released. If you don't remember, buy it! With Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Rick Gretch you can't go wrong. This album was the logical progression from ""Spencer Davis Group"" to ""Traffic"" for Winwood. ""Cream"" had broken up shortly before this was recorded, so Clapton and Baker were still in perfect form. Never have heard from Gretch again, but he was an excellent bassist and a perfect fit for this group. BUY IT!!!"
2,SOUNDS LIKE SLUDGE,"The ""Simply Vinyl"" version of this album is a very bad example of one of the greatest albums ever recorded. If you care about sound, you'll steer clear of this lo-fidelity record."
3,"Three and a half, actually","The newly formed Blind Faith was apparently rushed into the studio and told to produce an album, and the resulting product certainly reflects that reality. There just wasn't enough good material to make a great full length record, so you end up with a handful of superb tracks followed by a really long stinker (thanks very much, Ginger Baker). The standouts are Winwood's 'Can't Find My Home' and a fabulous reworking of Buddy Holly's 'Well Alright', which blows away both the original and Santana's copy-cat version.Worth buying for the great cuts and Winwood's incandescent vocals."
5,the best track is do what you like,"Ok, I was around when this albumn came out. We loved Cream, and we loved Spencer Davis Group. The combination seemed perfect, and it was, just not long enough. As far as the Clapton song, Presence of the Lord, it sounds a lot like his later works, meaning, forget me, I am not a rock star anymore. A very whiny song, not even worth listening too. Winwood's songs are great, as always. Now, as far as the main bain of my contention, the drum solo in Do What You Like, what is everybody's problem???????? This is by far the 3rd best song on this album. Ginger Baker was probably the greatest rock drummer of all time, and this solo proved it. When everybody came in at the end of it, what a bang. The flip side sort of sucks, but the second side rocks. Oh well, taste is so wierd."
2,Sometimes even super groups are so uninspired,"Terrific playing and singing on this album, but the songs are sub-par. Winwood's ""Can't Find My Way Home"" and Clapton's ""Presence of Lord"" hit their mark, but neither is among either man's best work. ""Sea of "" is listenable, but the others won't hold your attention long. The two bonus tracks should have stayed locked up in a vault."
2,Two very good songs do not make a great album...,"If there were more than six total tunes here, this would be a very worthwhile album. CANT FIND MY WAY BACK HOME,even if its falsetto vocals wear very thin, and PRESENCE OF THE LORD are two of the best songs of that time, and are still pretty good today, but the rest is mainly filler. Early Cream is much better, even though one can appreciate these guys were trying to do something new. Most of it doesn't stand up today though."
2,Blind Faith,"It was a one hit wonder. ""Can't find my way home"" to me is the only good song but it was good enough to buy the album because I really like that song."
4,"yes, they can.","Duane Allman was, without question, the slide guitar genius of his day, and a brilliant blues man. This album shows the remaining band picking up the pieces from tragic loss and showing not only that they could go on, but that they'd continue to reach the soaring heights of their perfected craft. This is more than an album: It is a classic statement of faith in each other and allegiance to the groove."
4,ABB Rules,"For mine, one of their finest albums. Recorded after Duane Allman's untimely death and just before Berry Oakley's demise (he plays on only a few tracks on this his last record) but brilliant playing from one of the South's finest bands. Especially love Jessica and Rambling Man. Lovely album"
5,Great allman bros. cd,"Had the album. this is about the 2nd cd. someone made off with the last one. Classic Allman bros. Just had to have another copy. Great songs, all of them."
4,Ahhh... the fond memories,"Perhaps not their best, but I certainly enjoy hearing these tracks again after so many years. Happy to have added this one back into my collection."
3,Very basic,"When I tried to help my 5th grader turn fractions into percentages I realized I needed a refresher. This book starts out with almost too basic of problem sets, such as addition and subtraction. But it quickly moves on to multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. After testing your skills, the author fully explains and writes out the process of finding the answers and then how to double check your work. Also a chapter with some minor math tricks to make it all go a little faster.With 2 chapters dedicated to applying these skills,the book successfully did the job I bought it for."
3,Where are the DVD's?,Check out the price (expensive) and the availability (almost none) of blank dual-layer DVD's before buying this.
1,Do not buy this product,"My Pioneer DVR-100 drive:Up to 2x with a variety of mediaSony:New firmware, doesn't burn at ALLMy drive has been returned."
4,Innocence Lost,Innocence Lost has some very good information for the first time parent and their children on the Internet. I recommend this book for any one that has children using the Internet and how to follow to links to protect their children. At times it was a little confusing for the person not knowing the case but does not take away from the value of the great information Ms. Mahoney provides for parents concerning about their safety of children and use of the Internet.
4,Awesome Navarro music!,"Love this CD. Very soothing and relaxing music! Want more of his music after ordering this one!!!Can listen to this over and over, does not get old!"
2,You're Not Going To Learn Tango from This Video,"I am glad I didn't buy this (got it as a gift). It's not great. The breakdown is not very thorough at all. You will be doing most of the teaching yourself because there isn't much instruction here, just videotaping of patterns. The instruction for the leader or the follower isn't there. It's just watch and follow. You're not going to learn tango from a video anyway. You can have all the steps in the world and still be a beginner if you can't dance with a partner. And that can only happen with real people. Normally I would say get a video to supplement your class, but I'd skip this one. There isn't enough break down to know what you are doing or if you are doing it correctly. On the positive side, everything is very easy to see. The lighting is good and you get full body shots."
1,very dissapointed,They toy is great fun but BEWARE it is wobbly on its legs so you must be careful around siblings that may be younger. And the worst part is this is the first lite brite outside of the travel one that runs on batteries alone!!!!! and it takes 6 D batteries. It eats throught them very quickly and makes it very difficult to keep up with. BEWARE OF THIS TOY UNTIL THEY ADD AN ADAPTER PLUG AND STRONGER LEGS!!!!!!!
3,Where are the refillls?!,"STOP! Before you consider buying this product, consider how your child will feel after playing with it for hours only to find out there are no refills for the peg and coloring sheets. Disappointed? You bet! Terrible planning on Hasbro's part. What a scam to sell a product this has a life span of roughly 4 hours."
4,easy to use,"My 5 year old son just received this for Christmas. He was able to quickly figure out how to use it. He enjoys the light show options and how easy it was to use. The case to store all the pegs is a very nice feature. The only problem is my two year old likes to dump the pegs, but that is not the manufactures fault(haha). It is also very sturdy."
2,Watch the little ones with this one!,"This was given as a Christmas gift to my 4 1/2 year old. We also have a 2 year old that likes to play with her sister and all her toys. Of course, we watch her with the small pegs, however, that was not the problem. I walked out of the room for, no kidding, 30 seconds, came back to my 2 year old colored BLUE! She had taken one of the markers and drew all over herself. OK, I take blame for that given I was out of the room, however, THE MARKS DO NOT COME OFF HER SKIN!!!!! I tried EVERYTHING (hairspray, vaseline, plain soap and warm water, alcohol based products, fingernail polish remover, scrubbing, etc. etc.) NOTHING WORKED. Nothing. It just has to wear off. PLEASE toy manufacturers - PLEASE - use washable markers when making products like this."
1,what a dumb toy,"To begin with . . . this thing is ENORMOUS! Where on earth am I going to store it? Second; this requires 6 size D batteries! At $6 for a pack of four, that starts to add up (seeing as my child NEVER remembers to shut it off). Third; the markers don't wash off (BTW, *what* is the point of markers combined with lite-brite?). Fourth; little pegs all over the place! And Last; the novelty of sticking pegs into little holes wears off fast. I can't wait to dump this one in the trash."
2,Indians were kind of neat...but there is no such sea monster,"The story and legends from the Indians were really good in this film, but the unstable white guy and the Wilatuck obsessed Spanish guy both killed the whole thing. I think this would have been a much better flick if the writer would have just based it all around the Indians and local legend.I don't believe there has ever been such a sea monster in that area, not like Loch Ness, but does get you going. It was kind of fun."
2,Whoa... this was ridiculousness,"The guy who wants to kill Willatuk is clearly mentally unstable, as is his family. It was very sad to see them exploited in this context. However, a separate show on TLC devoted to their craziness could be a ratings hit, a la Here comes Honey Boo Boo."
3,I had no idea,"The central conflict of this documentary is powerful and fascinating. To the Native Americans of the Seattle area, Willatuk (who looks a lot like Nessie) is both a real creature and a god of the sea who protects the native people. But to scientists, pseudo-scientists, the game-hunting crowd, this sea-creature is a something to be ""proven,"" perhaps captured or killed, worthy of study and nothing more. Naturally the natives are offended by this hunting down of their sacred being. So this isn't so much of a ""is the monster real?"" documentary, but one more example of the conflict between the spiritual and the secular taking place everywhere in our time. Worth watching but I took a couple stars away for some hokey reenactments and other silliness, beneath the otherwise overall dignity of the film."
4,Like Louisiana Better,"I had been buying The Louisiana Fish Fry Cobbler Mix and thought it was heavently. THEN, I saw The Calhoun Bend Mill Peach Cobbler Mix ADVERTIZED as the mix that Georgia uses for its Peach Festival. Since Georgia is the Peach capital of the US (and perhaps the world), I figured this Calhoun Bend Mix was worth a try.And it was. It is just as simple to make as the other mix...just add butter and water. But, to my taste it is not quite as sweet as the Louisiana Mix and I like my Cobbler to be very sweet; hence, I prefer the Louisiana Mix.But between the two, I think, it will just come down to a matter of taste...do you like it extra sweet? Or do you like it ""Very Sweet?"" For the Extra Sweet, go Louisiana. For the Very Sweet, go Calhoun. Both are a snap to make and get you compliments every time. So, it is just your choice!"
4,Interesting Book,"Professor Cesare Lombroso was a very celebrated scientist in Italy during his life in the late 19th century. During his life his works were devoted to a purely materialistic interpretation of the Universe, including his very contraversial theory of the Criminal mind published in his book ""Criminal Man"" (1876).As he wrote in his book ""After Death - What"":""If ever there was an individual in the world opposed to spiritism by virtue of scientific education, and, I may say, by instinct, I was that person.""Despite his initial skepticism, and his history and success in the sciences, Lombroso became firmly convinced of the truth of paranormal activities. This book is the product of his interest and extensive research into the paranormal and was published posthumously."
3,Taste is not so great,"This aloe vera juice is right to the point. The initial taste almost has a chemically manufactured reaction to the taste buds but after swallowing it's just plain old aloe juice. For the quantity, the price is great but i will return toNature's Way - Aloe Vera Whole Leaf Juice when this gallon is finished. Nature's Way tastes much better but also cost more. Feel free to experiment like i did & judge for yourself."
4,Actually cleans hair!,"I've tried a good amount of shampoos, and this one is number ONE. I have extremely thick, wavy and normal to dry hair. When I use this shampoo (compared to others) I actually feel it's Cleaner, when I wash it out. It also lathers easy for me (which is rare for me). I let my hair air dry (which is pretty tricky, having unmanagable hair)! But, my hair takes a nice shape after I use this shampoo and it's extremely soft (and I don't even use conditioner). So this is def. a great shampoo that actually works.The only thing I would change (if I could) is the scent. It's not bad..it's ok/nice but I have a sensitive nose to perfumey smells."
1,HAHAHAHAHA! MOISTURE RICH? FUNNIEST THING EVER!,"I have dry dry hair. Born that way. It worked like any ordinary conditioner that doesn't work. It has alchole in it which makes hair dry. Try Suave or Organix instead. Doesn't work any bit. It's really ""dry Rich"" If that what you want."
5,Bat Masterson: The Man and the Legend,"Mr. Dearment has provided an excellent read. The data is presented in a well thoughtout manner while the writing style is easy to read and comprehend. It seemed like there was less of Bat's later life presented then earlier days but that may be because there was more to present. I tend to read mostly non-fiction, historical books and found this to have been a very worthwhile project to read."
4,Look at the price...how can you refuse?,I bought this record for less than 3 in England and it has introduced me to a whole load of cool bands. I initially bought the CD for the Blink 182 songs but now I love it mainly for the ataris tracks. If you like a number of different styles of punk rock then this record is for you.
3,Why doesn't the publisher describe the booK?,"I gave this a 3 for ""Unknown."" Why is there so brief of a description? Possible buyers would like to know more about any book than is given here. What is the point of the word ""file"" in the title. I would guess that there might be something special or at least different in this ESL book, but the author and publisher have chosen to use the silent approach."
3,Good but not great,"Sadly, one of the most important and significant tracks is not mentioned in this book. Namely, Savannah, Georgia, which was the birthplace of the First American Grand Prix (then named Grand Prize) long before Watkins Glen and held the largest international road races in the pioneering days of motorsports with crowds of 150,000 in 1908 to 500,000 by 1911 when both Grand Prize and Vanderbilt Cup races were held. So I felt Savannah should have been highlighted and was disappointed that the very first Grand Prix track in America - truly a ""lost track"" was missed in a bookthat is supposed to restore the lost ones to its readers."
5,An easy read,"Another interesting book from Gordon Eliot White, this one covers many of the race tracks of the past which are no longer running auto races. Some I had visited, and others I have never seen, it does give a interesting view in to the past of motorsports."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This collection of essays has some high points and may make interesting--at times, shocking--reading for any mother. However, there was little that was particularly striking and little that seemed to apply to young mothers."
3,Decent looping yoyo,"The Yomega Raider is a decent looping yoyo. With little practice you can learn to loop consistently. Since this yoyo is specifically made for looping, only the easier string tricks should be attempted with this it. You can remove one or both of the spacers in order to have a better return from a throw. Be careful to not over tighten. The first day of using this yoyo, the rims kept coming apart. I decided to attempt to tighten it more than usual and the plastic threading for the axle cracked. I now am not able to unscrew the pieces, but it is still operational. I can still loop and do tricks, but am not able to change the bearing or spacers if I wanted."
3,My Yoyo Opinion,This yo yo is an OK yo yo. It has a good spin length of about 1/2 a minute(it may not seem long but its actually pretty good). It's very durable for a yo yo. The only thing that I found bad about it was that it was very hard to land on the string which makes tricks that involve flying trapeze very difficult. Over all this is a pretty good yo yo. I have enjoyed using this yo yo.thank you
1,JUNK P.O.S.,Worst yoyo ever. Sleep time is about 10 seconds. You can bid farewell to all tricks.Gap is extremely narrow which causes the string to touch the sides easily and the yoyo tilts completely.Get the FAST 201 or Protostar or NorthStar or DieNasty Glow or a G5.
5,Great book,This is another great book from Audubon. I have one from Florida and now one from the Rocky Mountains. These books help you understand the history of how these areas formed as well as tell you about every creature living there. Very good reading.
5,More of a treasure map than a field guide,"This is a nice little guide for identifying and understanding a selection of common flora and fauna of the Rocky Mountain States. Great for carrying in your rucksack on a day hike when your goal is simply to wander about and explore.Rather than using it to identify specific plants and animals, I have found that the best way to use this book is to find things listed in the book and then explore likely places where that item might be found.If you are serious about identifying birds or wildflowers, this is not really the book you need, but if you just want to get a general idea of the types of plants and animals you might see during a hike, this is great for the purpose.Considering it's small size, a great book for the price."
4,Matches well with older Cerwin-Vega! mains.,"I have some older CV towers and this center matches with them well enough tone wise that the limited center channel tone adjustment in my surround sound reciever was able to make all three sound alike, just wished it came in walnut instead of just black. As has been mentioned it is a big heavy speaker which is always a good thing as far as speakers go, you can never make a cabinet too stiff or too dense."
4,Its ok,Don't have much to compare it too.I recommend it be bought with matched speakers.Luckily I could tune it with my stereo setting.Make sure the ohm rating is correct for your sterio
4,Great book!,"Great book, lots of information on 'le' and 'la' Champagne! For me, it lost one star as 'The Makers' overview is not that comprehensive and consistent as the one in Stevenson's encyclopedia. However, this book is certainly a 'strong buy' - let the bubbles go!"
4,aluminum oxide cloth abrasive sheets,I have used aluminum oxide abrasive cloths for years because they are far superior to sandpaper. The cloth from amazon was of very good quality and I will have many hours of sanding from my purchase.
4,Police on VHS,I saw this video at a friend's house when it first came out (in the 80's). I love The Police and I'm so glad to have this in my collection! (I searched for it for YEARS!!!)
5,Great CD!,I am a true old country music lover and this one was a must for my collection. The songs are ones you've forgotten Hank Jr. sang. I am enjoying this great old music. There are few people that sing it like Hank Jr. and Sr. I would highly recommend this one!
3,"Ok, not great","This a very complete set for the price, but the lessons (as the cover might suggest) are very dated. This is a good start for people just getting into the game, but don't expect anything cutting edge or particularly entertaining"
2,GOLF TEACHER,"This instructional DVD did not do a very good of teaching me anything, it has a bunch of DVD's, but it wasnt very good, choose something else."
3,too much info...,"as with most golf instuction too much info. however, it will be good over a long period of time. can be overwhelming."
2,go with less disks...and a less all over the place set,I thought this set would be nice seeing as there are several well known names in it and a complete 5 discs...the biggest problem is until you get to disk 3 you are watching for 30 seconds then 2 minutes then 15 seconds...going thru menu after menu...I cant say anything about disk 4 and five all though it looks like these are for kids and ladies...I have the old Bob mann videos which basically run for an hour straight and found them to be much better...sometimes more is not better.
4,Typically Armstrong Stuff - Outstanding,"Armstrong is an excellent teacher who speaks clearly and directly, and gets his point across with great demonstrations. He can show you how to do it, tell you what he will do, and summarize how to do it. Awesome."
5,A great pal,"My 2 year old son loves to carry around this pup and feed him his bone. It has withstood tugging and pulling so far with no problems. It's still more fun to take the clothes off than to put them on, but that may change later."
4,Adventurous as said,"Quite a story. Some might not care for the scenery, but I must say quite interesting to watch.Great job."
5,Prince and Me 4,"This was a very entertaining sequel to the first sets. It is disappointing to have actors and actresses switched in the process of sequels, but the new ones did an excellent job. It is a clean movie to watch with a family."
2,Working to solve a diplomatic issue,"This movie continues the Romance of King Edward and Queen Paige in as they uncover a sad princess who is promised in marriage to someone she doesn't like or love. When the royal couple are due a gift of their choosing for bringing the sacred elephant back to the King, the would be groom is found out to be a cruel man who takes advantage of the country's people. The King cancels his daughter's wedding and she is allowed to wed the man she loves."
4,Perfect for Dosa,"We have been using this griddles for well over 7 years to make south indian delight, Dosai. Had no problem either on electric or gas stove. Everytime makes perfect dosas.My only complaint is the non stick coating wears off in 6 to 9 months. Then again, we use this almost every day since I love dosa."
4,Great for making Dosa (Indian food item),Couldn't find a better griddle for making the Indian food Dosa in US. This 13 inch non-stick griddle helps to make large crispy Dosas easily without having to add too much oil.
4,Good Pan for the Money!,"I bought this pan to replace a Calphalon pancake griddle pan. It is comparable to that pan, but less money than the big name brand. Good size and does a good job, however, the spot in the middle of the pan that is suppose to disappear when the pan is preheated does not work, which is why I gave it 4 stars."
5,Great pancake pan,"I this is another must have if you like pancakes!, the slim line edge of pan makes turning the pancakes easy, yet still has the multi-purpose of being able to scramble some eggs or fry up just a few slices of bacon."
2,Does not heat up quickly. Not good for making Dosa's,"I bought this pan after reading excellent reviews. The pan looks good and may be good for pancakes, but it does not provide enough heat for dosas on my electric stove. This is not very energy efficient. Prior to this we had Anolon anodized 12 inch nonstick round griddle, with which we had no problem. I bought this because it is a bigger pan with a better price. I returned the item since it did not serve my purpose."
4,Nice crepe pan for dosas,"Was looking for a good substitute for dosa and ordered this after going through other reviews. After more than a month, I am impressed with the Pan, especially the big spread of the dosa paste seamlessly in a second.the reason i give 4 is because I would have preferred a slightly curvy pan rather than a fully flat one. But as for the product & its make, i will give it 4.5. I usually reserve the remaining 0.5 for a 6 month experience."
3,the pan,"nice pan, but came with a small dent, didn't order a dent sometimes i believe ups can be a little rough with their deliveries, either that or i was sent a dented pan by pan company."
1,Too Big for Electric Stove,"This is too big for electric stove burner and kinda heats up the base of the stove quickly. We bought it for making Indian Dosas, though the Dosas are coming up good but the base of the stove is getting heated up because of the size of griddle which is at least double the radius/diameter of the burner and we stopped using it.This is a 13 inch one so think twice before you go for it.ThanksSuman"
4,Very nice,"I have this set of dice and I'm very pleased with them. The dice themselves feel good in your hand, with a pleasing weight and texture that I've noticed myself and also had friends I was gaming with who used them comment on.That said, the bag that comes with the dice is nice to have, but not of particularly impressive quality if you're a stickler for that kind of thing.Play with these dice in the New World of Darkness setting is very easy, as the numbers that ordinarily mean a success (8, 9, and 0) are highlighted to make it easy to see how you did at a glance.If you want to use them as regular d10s, or for the old World of Darkness, it IS slightly more difficult to read the numbers 1-7 because they're in black on black-and-red dice (8, 9, and 0 are in silver). It's really not difficult enough to matter, but worth mentioning. I doubt I'd have even thought of it as difficult, except for the contrast with the ease of reading the silver ""success"" numbers."
1,WAY too expensive,"I own the werewolf, changeling, and mage dice sets and my boyfriend owns half of a vampire set. While they may be nice and heavy and such, it's just way too expensive for a set of dice in a bag. My recommendation is do what I did when I saw the price; go buy a chessex set of d10's and a sharpie and color them in yourself. You'll be just as happy. Might not be a amazing as them, but it won't make your wallet hurt as much. Especially since they used to be only $15 when they first came out. They only cost so much because they are out of print."
1,A grossly overpriced mickey mouse book.,"An outrageous price for what you get: a thin, flimsy paperback containing few new ideas."
2,Ok but not good graphics,The game is fun but the graphics are lame compared to the nintendo ds. It is also priced high for its bad graphics
1,Awful,"Don't buy this bike. It comes with a generic instruction manual for what appears to be all Huffy products. The diagrams look nothing like this bike. After getting it together, the derailers simply wouldn't shift. I used the awful manual in an attempt to adjust. The adjustment screws were not marked on the bike even tho the manual said they would be. The manual then said if you can't get it adjusted, take it to a bike shop. Yeah, and $50 later it will be fixed. After 3 hours I gave up and returned this and the womens model I bought for a refund."
2,Packing should be improved,"When the bike arrived, the paper box that contained it was a little torn. There are some missing parts when I tried to assemble this bike. I had to find a bike store to fix it."
1,donnot buy!,these vitamines must be expired! i tasted and it was sizzeling/ nasty! Rx is saying they dont do refunds!!better buying them at target. the Gummies are good. hopefully not expired.
1,BAD! BAD! BAD! They actually deserve negative stars!,My child gagged upon eating these! I felt bad for not trying them first. She spit the vitamin out and then gagged. I tried one and couldn't choke it down. They taste HORRIBLE and after chewing it they kinda foam up in your mouth which causes the gag response. I am taking them back for full refund.My poor kid was talking about them the next day and said she NEVER wanted to eat them again. I don't recommend them for any child.
1,Teflon came off after 1 month,"Original post on 1/4/11: What I like most about this wok is its excellent non-stick coating. I use it everyday with wooden spatula. Wouldn't risk to use metal utensil although the product description says ok. I stir fry rice cake (very sticky) and gladly found the wok really non-stick. Extremely easy to clean. It's wide enough but a little too shallow (3"" in depth) comparing to other 14"" wok in the market. The bottom is very slippery on stove top. Make sure you hold the handle when you stir or turn the food.2/10/11 update: Very disappointed to find many scratches after 1 month. I use it with wooden utensil only and clean it with a sponge. For the health of my family, I had to throw it away when the Teflon came off. I hope this once-so-great wok last longer."
1,"Description Claimed Wok is 5"" deep, but is only 3.5"" deep.","Do not expect to get a 5"" deep wok - wok is a much too shallow 3.5"" for a 14"" wok. I expect product dimensions on Amazon to be accurate - this wok is not as deep as I need. I am thoroughly disappointed and will give this wok away.T-Fal is not what it used to be."
1,Not as described,The item delivered does not have the red thermo-spot (no such function) at all. Not as described at Amazon. Very disappointed.
2,Dangerous - slips all over the stove!,"I love this pan and hate it. It's nice and roomy and heats evenly and nicely. However, if you use two hands to toss the food (stir-frying) this pan has NO traction on the stove. I have a regular gas stove and didn't think anything could slide on such a surface, but as soon as I went to toss the food, the pan went flying. I guess a little oil went over the side during the slide, and next thing I know I have flames flying like saganaki in a Greek restaurant! It was very scary. You almost need three hands to use it. Two to stir-fry, and one to hold the handle down while you do. The other drawback is that it doesn't come with a lid, and you're not likely to have one lying around that's big enough.If you can find a way to secure it while cooking, like surrounding it with big heavy pots so it can't move while cooking, it's a great pan. Otherwise, it is VERY dangerous."
2,Doesnt hold on stove,Only gripe is that this is more suitable for induction heating. It slips to easily over the stove.
3,Don't use metal utensils,"The Amazon discription said it is ""safe to use with metal utensils"", however, even with wood utensils, it seems to leave marks on the wok. Doesn't seems like the coating is coming off, but I won't try it with metal utensils. It is also very light, which could be good and bad. Good because it heats up and cools fast so you can control the temperature very easily. However, when you try to cook, it also move around a lot, so you need hold the handle with the other hand when you stir fry stuff. It is also a pretty big wok, which make finding a lid a bit difficult. Other than that it is a good wok, especially for the price."
2,This pot is not good for electric range cooktop,"We use electric range so the cooktop is very flat. The bottom of this pot will swell after heating, which cause the pot start to rotate or float during cooking. This is extremely difficult when you need to stir and fry and may be dangerous when the pot is very hot. We had another style of T-fal pan fryer 5 years ago which did not have such problem at all because the bottom was compounded and very nicely strengthened."
5,Great Wok,"I did much research before the purchase. Recieved the Wok and was very pleased. Have used it 3 times now. Heat indicator is great for letting you know when the Wok is ready to cook. Heats fast, light weight and very easy to clean. I would highly recommend this product."
4,JUMBO wok,"This is a very nice wok, but it is very big. I would have been happy with a smaller model for our 3 person family. Also, I wish I had a lid for steaming the hard veggies. That is not a product flaw."
3,"great non-stick, bad wok-action",This pan has great non-stick coating and good heat-transfer but the sides arent angled quite right for proper wok tossing action. If you like stir frying using a wood spoon as a stirring utensil then I guess this wok would be great.
2,Too easy to scratch,Used it for 6 month with only wood utensils. It was lightweight and easy to use but also scratch prone. In the end I had to trash it as it had too many scratches.
5,excellent wok,"We use our wok daily and I am glad to find this one. It is big enough, has good nonstick coating and yet light weight. This is just what I wanted. Good price for the product too."
5,love this wok,"big, easy to clean, and CHEAP! the extra handle on the other side is useful for large meals. happy with my wok"
5,Great for the price,"My husband wanted a wok, so I bought this one because it matched our pots and pans. Turns out, I'm the one who's used it most. Cooks really well and cleans up great. We love it."
5,Good price and good quality,Very good price for the quality that you got. So far I am very happy with it.
2,Just another ploy for someone to make $$ off knowing Elvis...,"I was very disappointed in this! 42 minutes ??? And it is just someone who""knew"" Elvis talking about him. Didn't say anything I had not already reador heard! To me it is just another shot at making a buck off of knowing (?)Elvis Presley.Would not waste my money to rent it again - much less BUY IT !!!"
4,Rock and Roll,"This really is a superb collection of live recordings from Boston's legendary Real Kids. If this is the first Real Kids CD you buy, then I can assure you that you will want more! Straight ahead, high energy, no B.S. rock and roll in the fine tradition of the Ramones, Iggy, Dolls and the MC5 (as the MC mentions in his intro) with the melodic quality of the Beatles and Kinks thrown in for good measure. After I bought the LP, I discovered that the CD had extra tracks. Doh! What to do but by the CD too! Yeah, this is good."
4,Haynes Manuals,"I always have to have the reference manuals. I'd perfer more detail on some issues and less 'general repair aimed a the novice'. However the Haynes Manuals are a must for any car owner (do it yourself or have the work done, so you can reference what is being stated as the problem)."
4,great soundtrack,"This is probably one of the greatest soundtracks...rather than putting in only the bad songs like in newer soundtracks, they put ALL of the songs from the movie...so you may have some bad songs but you have 25 songs and most are good!"
3,"If You Love Grease, You'll Love This - Only 1 Major Flaw","Disc 1 is like the original album, which I also own. 1 major flaw is that ""Love Is A Many Splendored Thing"" cuts off at the very end of it! I was upset by this, hence the 3 stars instead of 4. Disc 2 is a lot of fun w/some remixes and sing-a-longs, all in all, I'm pretty happy with it being that I'm a HUGE Grease fan. If you like Grease, you'll love this, it's fun. Too bad when they ""remastered"" it, they didn't catch there 1 mistake. Oh well, at least I have it on another album."
2,Old favorite doesn't get better with time,"I don't know what I was thinking. One day I had the urge to buy this album: I thought that I was somehow not fulfilling some sort of duty by not owning it. I've never been a big fan of the film or play, but it's such a part of the culture of a certain era that I simply had to own it. As it turns out, I was wrong: it's not a very interesting CD even as a cultural relic."
2,hasn't aged well,aside from a couple of songs this disc is very forgettable.it hasn't aged well at all.the movie is better.hearing John Travolta sing is a bad joke.
1,"Insipid soundtrack, Grease is no longer the word!","It isn't the same after two decades, this CD is insipid, boring and flat, the only remarkable song is ""Summer Nights""."
4,Go Stockard Channing!,"""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" is my favorite part of the film and the soundtrack. Stockard Channing brings so much character into this performance and she steals the film. On a technical level, this is a good sountrack, though the chronological order of the songs is a mess. I simply program the disc to my own preferences. The songs have stood the test of time and sound as vibrant and catchy as ever. This is a film and soundtrack that has grown on me with time, and I seem to enjoy it more each time I see or hear it."
4,"A Semi-Smashing Soundtrack, But Lacking","It is a great cd with some memorable vocal perfomances, but the orignal broadway soundtrack is still a must-have for true Grease fans. Travolta is solid and Oliva Newton-John has that nice girl act down pat, but where are the most meaningful songs of the show? The movie made the mistake of making it a two character film. Yes, a two character film (Danny and Sandy). Where was Doody with Those Magic Changes or Roger lightening up the mood with Mooning? There were other characters in the original show that should at least be heard. Producer Alan Carr destroyed an ensemble cast. Why did they leave out the most bebopping song, All Choked Up? You're the One That I Want is fine if you like a little disco flare served with your burger and fries at a fifties malt shop. The soundtrack has the style of any big screen musical, but it is definitely a disappointment to anyone who knows the Broadway version."
5,What's not to love about Grease?,I downloaded this soundtrack and promptly put it on a CD for my CD system. It was fast and easy sounds wonderful!
5,5 STARS UP: WOULD YOU?,THIS ALBUM IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. IT IS REALLY ACE MY FAVOURITE SONG IS YOUR'E THE ONE THAT I WANT AND WE GO TOGETHER. OH AND LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES. THEN YOU'L BELIEVE ME
3,Generally good sound quality but not all tunes are keepers,"The movie was terrific, but I only found some of the music worth ripping. I generally prefer original hits by original artists. I wasn't that impressed with Sha-Na-Na's renditions of past hits.My first interest was for danceable numbers. Movie soundtracks can have tempo changes and undanceable introductions and endings, but those sections can be removed after ripping.I found a couple reproduction glitches. There is a tic (like a record scratch) in ""Mooning"", and ""Love Is a Many Splendored Thing"" cuts off too soon.The nine tunes I ripped were: Grease; Summer Nights; Hopelessly Devoted to You; You're the One that I Want; Beauty School Dropout; Greased Lightnin'; Blue Moon (because it's a slow version); Mooning; and We Go Together.FYI, I'm a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay."
5,great but.....,"This cd is awsome, but I don't care for the songs that at played a the prom. My favorite songs are the orignal cast songs!"
4,It makes me smile...,"I love having the ""Grease"" CD in my car. I can imagine how silly I must look driving down the streets of Houston smilin' & just singin' along."
2,okay,"I wasn't to happy with this soundtrack. The quality of the recordings are not great, the music is scrambled all over the place -- it left me dissapointed. I am a huge Grease fan. That's the saddest part."
3,You're not gonna see many of these.......,"Ok, Grease, great musical, great cast, great vocals, but not the greatest music. Songs like ""Hand Jive"", You're the One that I Want"", and ""Grease Lightning"" with their fast pace rock'n'roll beat and 50's style vocals really get me going and make me wanna dance and sing. On the other hand, songs like ""It's Raining on Prom Night"" and ""Tears on my Pillow"" with their slow, sappy beat and vocals make me wanna fast forward through the song. My personal favorite vocals on the album were those belonging to Sha-Na-Na. There fast pace beat and 50's style vocals take me to another place. My review, one thumb up, one down."
4,Addicting,"I've had a copy of this CD for years, ever since I first watched the movie and became a little obsessed. I listen to it regularly - at least twice a month. And always enjoy it. I bought this second copy for a friend who had never seen the movie before we went to a ""Grease Sing-Along"" - she came out humming pieces of several songs all strung together - so I couldn't resist getting her her own copy of this fabulous music."
4,A masterpiece in business logistics,"It's an old book, but it's a cornerstone in its field of study. A ""must have"" for everybody that study Logistics or Supply Chain Management."
3,No miracle cure,"This book isn't the miracle cure for all women who are trying to go from Miss to Mrs.,(what book would be?) but it does have a generous amount of useful information when trying to understand the mind of the unmarried male and taken male. I really loved the ""marriage marketing"" section. There was a bit of truth in that and was the most memorable part of the book for me."
3,Good Read,"This is good for the woman that is looking to manipulate her significant other into believing that he is ready to marry her. It was entertaining with some kernels of truth, however, not a get-engaged-bible."
5,Wonderful!,"Rakove gives the reader a concise & readable account of the life of this central figure of the American founding. A breeze to read, but doesn't shortchange the reader in terms of insight & rigor. The capstone chapter ""The Legacy of the Founder"" is alone worth the price of the whole volume. For those interested in the creation of the Constitution, I would suggest reading this book after one of the shorter histories of the Constitutional Convention (I prefer Berkin's ""A Brilliant Solution"", but there are several very good ones out there), then turning to Rakove's magnificent ""Original Meanings""."
4,"Well-Organized, Easy to Follow","I think Rakove did a great job organizing this book. It is easy to follow and the chapters stick to their subject. The author points out that Madison was a very private man- so there isn't much information about his private life. So the bulk of the book is about his political life- which was actually what I was more interested in. In regards to Madison, what I found most interesting about him was his views on property rights. An issue that seems to be in hot debate for modern times. Madison felt that this was a fundamental issue for personal liberty. p.227 ""his major fear was that a government dominated by people holding only small amounts of property would enact legislation inimical to the just rights of the wealthier segments of society."" Seems we never learn from history and continue to force the same arguments."
1,The Inner Jefferson by Andrew Burstein,"I purchased this book to learn about the life of Jefferson not to have some, would be, psychologist analyze every word written by or said by Jefferson. Unless you are some intellectual, who is into this kind of information, don't buy it."
3,Wrangler Jeans,"I've been buying these jeans for several years now. While I agree they are not a very heavy denim, the price is right. I use these as work jeans and compared to a brand like Carhartt, they are 1/3 the price. Some may say they are 1/3 the quality as well. I wear them out pretty quickly and don't feel bad about tossing them in a month or so when they get stained or torn. I don't feel as good about tossing a pair of thirty dollar jeans when they get stained. I buy these at WalMart and pay between fourteen & seventeen dollars. I recall one time last year WalMart had then for nine ninety nine. The price here is way too high."
1,Sizing is WAY off,"I ordered a pair of these which arrived today. I have other pairs of Wrangler jeans, and figured the sizing would be the same, boy was I wrong. These jeans arrived today, and compared to my other Wrangler jeans, these are nearly 2 sizes SMALLER in the waist for the SAME SIZE on the tag. I know they are cheap jeans, at only $17, but, they should size the same as all of the other pairs I've bought. Needless to say, I will not be buying another pair of these worthless jeans ever again."
2,Rather disappointing!,"This product did not meet my expectation. It was supposed to be a regular rise but feels like a low rise. It is too tight for jeans that are labeled as relaxed fit jeans and is rather shorter than the expected length...all these unwashed. Only God knows what will happen after the first washing. This particular product is disappointing for a wrangler jeans. If you need to order this product online, order a larger size than you need, and stay away from the blasted indigo. It actually looks awful!"
2,Hanging out,I've bought these at Walmart for a couple of years now. I don't know why I keep buying them. They all do the same thing after about maybe a month. First thing is a hold starts on the left side of the crotch. About the same time the material starts tearing on the right thigh. It looks cool and all if I was 20 but I'm not. It not a fashion thing with these it's just poor material. A few more washes and both holes are too big to get away with wearing in public. I don't want to be the guy that is known for letting lefty hang out for all to see.Time to break down and pay the 40.00 for a pair of real Wrangler mwz I think it's called and see if they last longer.
5,Just what I want in basic jeans.,"I used to wear strictly Levi's, but decided a while ago that the quality of Levi's jeans is now rather poor. I bought a pair of Wranglers a couple years ago to try them out and decided that they are what I want in basic jeans. The 2 pairs I recently bought from Amazon haven't disappointed me. The denim is thick (but not too thick) the way I like and after a couple of washes it feels soft and retains it's ""denim"" feel. So far the seams haven't ripped or weakened (and they do get heavy use). I'm very pleased with these Wranglers and will buy them again in the future."
2,Fake wranglers,"These are not wranglers. I am not sure who makes them. But everything about them is not wrangler. The stiching is all wrong even the leather patch on the rear waste isn't even right. The denim is alot thinner than any other jeans I have purchased. So if you want a cheap pair of jeans these are ok, but not wrangler quality."
2,wrangler's,I have been buying this exact wrangler jeans for years and I couldn't believe the poor quality of my recent purchase. The material is so thin you could almost see through it. This will be my last wrangler's if this is the kind of jeans they are now producing.
2,Esthe carica,"Items were rec. damaged poor packaging..cracked glass containers (2), was old product Exp. date of 9/07."
5,Great,"A little goes a long way, I would recomend this to anyone that has a pond. It makes topping off the water level very easy."
1,A poorly written (or maybe edited?) book,"This book is poorly written. The first part, about the efforts of detective/co-author Keers to catch serial killer Bill Suff is not bad, but the second part, about Suff's life, rehashes many of the killings and incidents surrounding them in virtually the same words! And in the third part -- about the trial -- one of the incidents is repeated for a third time. What I found extremely annoying about this book was the use of square brackets -- [ ] -- within quotes to supposedly ""clarify"" what was said. By the book's end, many of these insertions (by the authors or by the editors?) have gone beyond clarification and amount to editorializing. There is at least one instance of brackets which are within the text of a descriptive paragraph -- not a quote! Most of the 16 pages of pictures are of murdered prostitutes (many nude with black bars over their breasts and genital areas) and look like police evidence photos."
2,very dissapointing,"i was anticipating this to be a solid hip hop album, something the wu tang is notorious for and u-god as well. however after the abysmal chorus in track 7 and u-god's sudden desire to bless us with his singing skills in track 13, i couldnt wait for the cd to end. i gave it a two out of decency for the wu and not to knock their name, but other than possibly 3 mediocre to decent songs, this album is pathetic, and ranks at the bottom for wu tang solo projects."
3,"U God has a smooth delivery in his flow, but sings too much.","U God has his distinct style of fluent sounding rap that makes him stand out on various guest appearances on other rap songs. With his first solo CD, his flow continuous genuine to how it always has been. However he did more singing than necessary, and some of the beats become annoying. Along with RZA, there are some good producers putting beats together, while some beats still need work. True blue Wu-Tang fans won't be too disappointed, but others will have too look forward to Tony Starks's new one. It's worth checking out though."
2,2.5 Stars for the God...,"U-God has always been a good MC whenever he is featured on a track. His impact is greater that way. Unfortunately, the God can't hold down and entire album alone with the limited lyrical content..some of the beats on this joints are ok but overall...below average effort...one"
2,WHY DID U LET ME DOWN???,"I had U-God as not only being one of the illest lyricalist out there but also as my favorite Wu-member(besides Meth).....UNTIL I heard the solo album. Only like 1/3 of the tracks were slammin or aight...but the rest broke my heart. Either the beats bore me to depression or his usual ""BONE CRUSHING SUPREME"" lyrical style became some weak off beat type of style. I actually was hoping that every track was going to be ill, but most of the tracks sounded like skits or melodys. Why doesnt he represent on his FIRST SOLO ALBUM like how he represents as a guest on his fellow Wu-member projects or the Wu-family albums??? I admit at least track 7 got my head bangin time to time...probably cause the Meth and Inspectah represented with there usual flow up in that piece. By the way...is it me...or was there an ill track by U-god that wasnt put in this album????? I heard it on the radio.....and that was the end of it....what happened???"
3,Could have been better.,"When the album starts, the listener has to stop what they're doing and listen. Unfortunately, after about five or six songs, the album gets kinda mediocre. The last two or three match up with the brilliance at the beginning, but the internal mediocrity drags it down. Overall, the productions is pretty good. The lyrical style God spits in the middle, though, is just a disappointment. Maybe his next effort will be better."
2,lame,"u-god has always been a sub par MC. he sometimes fares alright off of a rza beat but that isnt the case on this cd. u-god and masta killah have always been by far the worst wu rappers and u-god fares very poorly by himself. track #7 with inspectah deck is alright which is why it might earn 2 stars. but if you want some good hip hop go with maybe some method man, gza, or ODB. cuz u god [is] bad"
1,Yall going to Hell for lying....The Whole CD is Whack,"I love the WU but....The first step in getting help is admitting you have a problem. You all can't be serious this is the worst. Its so bad its right down there with Cappadonna's Yin and Yang and Deck's horrible cd The Movement.The difference between those CD's is I wrote their reviews without laughing it wasnt anything humerious or funny about how bad those were ,but Golden Arms I have to stop in between words because I remember how sorry that ish is and its funny to me.""Turbo Charged Bon Voyage and Im doing my way"" He either thinks he's at Burger king or he's Frank Sinatra. Straight Comedy. Why does he have to sing that part like that!! Come on that ish is Chessy.Now LA the Darkman the CD he put out years ago a WU Banga Heist of the Century. I always make recommendations for every negative review I do. What do LA's CD and Jlo's bed have in common..everybody slept on it. Get heist of the century leave that Ugod stuff alone."
3,Enter U-God,"Recently I just picked up Ghostface Killah's, Inspectah Deck's, and U-god's new CDs, while I had the new GZA's, ODBs, and Meth/Redman's CD. I haven't check out Raekwon's let. Just sticking to Clan official members, since Wu's Forever, only RZA's and Meth's ""T2000"" were below average. All of the recent Wu releases were hot, which leads us to this one. I would've given this 3.5 stars, but I can't. U-god is really an unknown clan member till this solo. Whlie this Cd covers a darker side of the Wu, its still hot! ""Bizarre"" has got to be one of the tightest Wu solo songs since ""All I got is You"" Meth/Mary J. Blige. Other tight songs are ""Turbulence"", Soul Dazzle"", ""Lay Down"", and ""Hungry"". Only one song is weak and the rest are average enough to listen once in awhile. This CD will defiantly be over looked by Wu's and non-Wu's. Thats unforunate for tru Wu's cuz this Cd is better than one would think."
1,Worst Wu-Tang release Yet,"This is by far the worst thing thrown out by the RZA. ""Beneath the Surface"" was stagnant, but at least had a good flow on it. This album opens with an amateurish freestyle and goes downhill from there will uncreative beats and cheesy keyboards. An album of this caliber I would only expect from Cash Money or No Limit, but not Wu-Tang. If you liked ""Ironman"" or ""Liquid Swordz"" don't buy this album."
4,do you like rza beats?,"this album was pretty good. U god is a crazy emcee, he's loud, and in your face. rza produced the beats for this album. they sound good, but i think gza would have done a better job. if you have a playstation, you should buy the playstation game wu tang shaolin style, because the game doubles as an audio cd, and it has the best song from the u god album on it, called rumble. other good songs on the u god cd are bizarre, soul dazzle, pleasure or pain, and well, that's it, it's pretty good though"
3,Not as impressed as I thought I'd be!,"As much as I love the Wu-Tang, I rarely ever find a complaint to lodge in regards to their solo albums. U-God, however, left me hoping for more. I'm one of the few people I know who has extoled his virtues in arguments, making cases for Golden Arms as one of the strongest Wu members and appreciating his lack of commercial influence. Granted, those aspects of U-God's persona are still available on the album, yet it seems to be an unfinished effort. Rushed and no attention paid to detail. When will the RZA return? His absence has been problamatic on several Wu releases and I believe this to be a shining example. For a better example of U-God's ability check out his guest appearance with Cypress Hill on their third release, Temples Of Boom. He assisted on a track called ""Killa Hills"". Now that's vintage U-God. Still, I don't regret the purchase of this album, it still shames half the hip hop albums that have come out in the past year."
1,"Product is good, DAB stinks!","CC Pollen is an excellent brand from a non-polluted area which is important since pollen sucks in pollution completely. This product is wonderful and the health benefits from a good, quality bee pollen are immeasurable. HOWEVER, the company DAB who ships this has the WORST service ever. My product did not ship in the timeframe listed....taking 10 days after the order was placed. When I ordered it, it said it was in stock. If that was not the case, they should have notified me. 5 days after placing the order when it kept showing ""shipping soon, I contacted them, never heard back. FINALLY on the 19th, they email that it's been on back order. Why the delay in contacting the customer and why should the customer have to initiate contact. TERRIBLE service. Will order the pollen from another company on Amazon next time around."
2,I previously bought High Desert Bee Pollen in a Can.,"My earlier purchase was colorful pollen, bright, and very fresh, with a zingy tangy flavor, loved it. This time I ordered a la Internet via Amazon and the pollen has a dull color, and you may break a tooth as I did. I recommend you do not bite down but let it dissolve somewhat on the tongue before biting. It also does not have even half the tangy flavor of the previous purchase. I am no connesseur of bee pollen but the difference was so vast, I do believe what I just purchased is not a fresh product as it is dull in color and hard textured and less flavor, all hallmarks of staleness. I do not recommend, and will not buy again."
1,so bitter had to return it,"I couldn't even eat this stuff, I had to return it. It was extremely bitter, not at all like bee pollen I've had in the past. I'm used to a light honey taste. This had an aftertaste that was like eating the worst chemicals."
2,CC Pollen High Desert Raw Bee Pollen,"This product came highly recommended throughout my search online. I purchased some bee pollen locally as I waited for my online order to arrive. I do not plan to purchase this item again due to it's flavor. The bee pollen I found locally was sweet and delicious while CC Pollen High Desert's flavor was bitter and a bit stinky. I'm sure it's a personal preference, but nothing I saw online indicated a different flavor."
4,Fresh,High Desert bee pollen is shipped fresh but the zipper on the bag tends to not stay closed while stored in the refrigerator.
3,Sur[rising lack of consistancy.,"The first two bags we bought came in packages like the one pictured. The product was soft, tasty and chewy. Very pleasant to eat. The two additional packages we just bought were black in color, very different from the first packages but the same brand. This second batch is hard, crunchy and dry and does not taste as good as the first batch. We are using it anyway. The first batch I rated 5 stars. I'll only give this batch a 3."
3,Taste ok.,I bought this because of the good reviews. The taste is so so. I will not buy this product again.
3,Not the best tasting stuff,"A friend recommended that I add bee pollen to my diet, so I'm a newbie. The price was good on this one, but I couldn't get through even a quarter of the bag because of the icky taste and texture. I tried it with cereal, in smoothies, in oatmeal, etc. I guess I'll just give it to my friend!"
2,Fresh bee pollen Made in the USA,"Try Brushy Mountain Bee Farm in Moravian Falls, NC. They collect and refrigerate EVERY DAY fresh pollen available in 1 and 5 lb bags; $13.50 and $58.00. Take it from a beekeeper. Buying local is best and best for you. Call your neighborhood beekeeper and see if anybody is collecting. Better yet, join your neighborhood beekeepers association. Not all members are beekeepers and public is generally welcome. Best....get your own bees and help put bees back in your neighborhood."
3,Joiners,This was purchased for an HO rail set that I bought for my boys. They are durable and work great for the set. I reccommend the seller. Packaged and shipped professionally and expediently. Will use seller again.
1,Sayonara Gamera,"Ah, the last Gamera movie in the original series. The series progressively got worse and unfortunately, as much as I love the fire breathing turtle, it went out with a whimper than a bang. Most of the movie is stock footage from previous Gamera films, and I don't mean a quick flashback for reference or a reoccurring character have a dream sequence. And the new original content sprinkled throughout isn't much better. It's not a surprise this is one of the harder to find Gamera movies. While the dai kaiju fan in me loved finally being able to watch the ""lost"" Gamera movie, especially hosted by the lovely Elvira, it's nothing special and even fans of the genre can safely skip it without feeling like they're missing something."
2,Only for Hard Core Dan Curtis /Dark Shadows fans,"Okay, these movies run like mini soap operas. ""Come Die with Me"" (that's how you'll ask your friends to watch it with you!) Has Kathryn Leigh Scott (D.S. Josette/Maggie Evans) playing the girlfriend to this guy who murders his brother and the house keeper wants him to stay their with her. Invasion of Carol Enders is about a woman's spirit taking over a young lady named Carol Enders. John Karlen (D.S. Willie Loomis) is in this one - he plays the drunken ex-husband in need of money (He always makes me laugh!). The odd thing about these movies is hearing Dark Shadows music cues for scenes that do not require that much build up. So, basically if you want to make fun of something that has our old friends from Dark Shadows in it Or, if you like soap opera's from the 1970's but don't have the time to watch an entire series - than this set is for you!. I actually like the music to lull me to sleep at night when I try to forget that I over paid."
1,This is SUCH CRAP!!! I can't BELIEVE they would release such garbage on DVD!!,"OK, where do I begin. Yes, that's right...this is total CRAP! I bought this video because I enjoy both Meredith Baxter and Eileen Brennan. I never heard of either of these SMARMY films and wasn't expecting much. Honestly, these were worse than I expected...MUCH WORSE!! Both movies were poorly filmed, written, directed and poorly acted. I think the actors were reading from que cards like on an old soap opera from the 1970's. Just awful. Save your money. This double feature is a waste of time."
1,Pirated copy which is not well done,"I contacted the publishers and copyright holders of the book, and they were unaware of this electronic edition. That makes it pirated, right?Also, the quality of the typesetting is awful. There was clearly a home job."
4,Al-hamdulillah; probably the most reliable text in English..,A book which at times puts one in the shoes of the blessed Prophet of Islam (pbuh). It's recommendid by Shiek Hamza Hanson so give it a try and enjoy.
5,A great investment!!,"This is a book to keep for life, to lend and EDUCATE your friends and family.The author has simply laid down the life of Prophet Muhammad (saws) for both Muslims and non Muslims to appreciate his greatness .It is in great detail, and it is amazing to see how much Muslims know about the life of their Prophet, as compared to the LITTLE Christians know about Jesus."
5,excellent,item was delivered promptly and in good condition..I was very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this user to anyone!
4,Only one-volume traditional biography available,"Since Alfred Guillaume's ""Life of Muhammad"" is no longer in print, this is the only one-volume traditional Muslim biography of Islam's prophet available.Unfortunately, it relies only on Ibn Hisham's edition of Ibn Ishaq's biography, and so leaves out the whole ""Satanic verses"" episode. If you want to read that, you'll have to get the translated Meccan volumes of the History of al-Tabari."
4,"Good narration, good overview","I thought this was a pretty good introduction to the Prophet's life. The book was well-narrated. I think there is a lot more to learn, though. I think the book tried to stay to the facts, and did not offer opinions on the events that happened. I appreciated that un-biased tone."
1,Still Waiting,"Ordered in early November with several other items, but this has not arrived - all the others have tho'.Please locate and send. Because it has not arrived, I can not tell you the wonders of this appliance, but I look forward to doing so."
1,DANGEROUS - would give zero stars if I could,I bought this a week ago. Used it three time. Every time I have sliced a knuckle or finger. My husband got so mad the lasttime he made me throw it in the trash.
3,"Okay, but not much in the way of options","It works just fine, but you don't have much in the way of options. Only a few thickness settings, one blade. It works just fine for what it is, but if you want to be fancy with things look for another unit"
3,Great blade but...,"The slicer works fine, it's sharp as it should be. But there are a couple of design flaws I've come across. I find the slicing area a bit too narrow for my liking. Also, the slice thickness selector is a weird square-shaped bar on the underside near the blade. It doesn't turn very easily, and the thickness Is difficult to read as its black on black."
2,See one before you purchase,"I bought this slicer primarily on the number of good reviews. I was very disappointed with the slicer once I received it. First this is very small and made of very flexible plastic. It is way too flexible and flimsy. The ceramic blade while sharp isn't as sharp a good SS blade. I would guess its more durable though. The thickness selector is very stiff small square bar you turn on the back. The markings are the same color as the plastic bar and very difficult to see. If you don't get the bar to stop squarely, the thickness is off."
1,cheaply made - broke easily,"Never having used or purchased a mandonline before, I was happy with this when i first got it although I agree that it is dangerous. My daughter and I both sliced our fingers a few times before we got the hang of it. The guard is not very good, but it's OKAY. The disappointment came because it broke so easily. We hand-wash it, and used it fairly often to slice onions and peppers in our salad. It does a nice job. Also does a nice job with cucumbers. BUT, the plastic edge broke on one side. I tried crazy glue and then epoxy. neither worked. We were still able to use it by holding it togeter with a rubber band and slicing gently. It was a pain. But then the other side cracked and broke as well.For $25 I think this is a rip-off. I would like to investigate sending it back to the manufacturer or distributor because it should not be falling apart so quickly.ND"
2,Would not recommend - disappointed,"Always wanted a small mandolin to slice cucumbers, onions, etc quickly and evenly. This has a ceramic blade and seemed small and simple to use. Plus, the reviews were great. But there are a couple issues with it. 1) The hand guard is worthless. It does not grip anything. 2) while sharp, it slices way too thinly. I leave it on the biggest setting -- 3mm, but the slices are still too thin. The other 2 settings do not work. I now only use this if I want to slice cucumbers really quickly, even if they are too thin for my liking. I am surprised by all of the high ratings. I bought it for $19 though, so at least it was relatively inexpensive."
1,Slicer,"The product is great, if you don;t cut your finger with it. In which I did and after 2 months its still sore..These slicers are good, but when cutting potatoes, very carefully, you still can cut your self due to the fact that it can stick and your finger does not..."
3,Just too small,"This seems to be well made and is easy to use. Unfortunately, the cutting area is too narrow to cut a whole onion on and the 3.0 mm cut is very very thin, too thin for carmelizing onions. If you are just slicing carrots its great but not good for onions."
4,Excellent mandoline,"I got this mandoline based on the reviews and having owned other kyocera ceramic knives and it has been great. It is very compact and light which makes it easy to store and use. It also made quick work of the potatoes I was cutting for a gratin. The blade is very sharp and the 4 adjustments are easy to make with a turn of the dial below. The guard however is not that great at holding the actual potato or whatever you may be slicing unless you put a lot of force on it. But overall, it's a great mandoline for the price."
4,successful search,"my daughter received a mandoline as a wedding gift, made of stainless steel and i have been searching for one like it these many years. i did not believe that a ceramic blade would work as well, however i was wrong. it is great !!"
5,Best Mandolin Around!,"This is an essential tool for your entire home slicing of firm vegetable.I use it often on carrots, lotus-roots, etc.Its ceramic blade is sharp and stays sharp for long time.The slice thickness is easily adjustable; the tool is light and compact.I do not use the hand-guard but beware the blade is sharp, sharp!I like the blade to be sharp and I managed to get some small cut on my fingers along the way.I do not like the vegetable holder, though, I suppose, I could use Kevlar gloves to protect my finger... Now I just stop short of the last few slices, and it works just fine for me.Highly recommended."
2,Only the thickest setting works,This mandoline slices TOO thin. It has four settings and even the thickest makes very thin slices. The thinner settings just tear foods like cucumbers and tomatoes.
3,Slicer,"This slicer works very well for super thin cuts. I had hoped to use it for fried potato slices, but it is not capable of cutting more than 3/16 of an inch."
3,Kyocera CSN-202-RD,This mandoline is not as adjustable as I had thought-but is fine for onions etc. Might even order again.BJ Lower
4,A bit lightweight but does a great job,"One of the people that rated this with 3 stars also posted a video review in the three star section and really captures the advantages/disadvantages of this item.the gizmo that adjusts the thickness of the cut is a bit stiff to operate.the thing that is supposed to grasp the item being sliced is virtually useless so i use a heavy glove and am very careful to make sure my fingers don't get close to the blade.the ceramic blade is super sharp and i've had no problems running items through it.the ""dishwasher safe"" designation is a great advantage."
3,"Nice, but it could have been better made","Length:: 5:39 MinsI use my chef knives for much of my food slicing but when I need a lot of uniform slices I like to use a mandoline. I have a professional model but I was looking for something for small jobs, like a few slices of carrots, potato or garlic. I like the idea of a ceramic blade so I decided to give this one a shot.I liked this slicer okay but it could be better built, even at this price. I decided to make a video review in order to show it in action. Even though my mandoline is Black I decided to review this one as well since they both work the same way. I hope that you find it useful. Thanks!Note:I guess I forgot to turn my remote mic back on for the Bron mandoline piece. Sorry about that.Bron Original Stainless Steel Mandolin SlicerCUT RESISTANT GLOVES-100% KEVLAR, Heavy Weight Textured Blue Latex Coated,large, (1 pair)"
3,Great slicer. Blade chips too easily (even plastic guide chips it),"Super sharp. Slices evenly and fast. A bit flimsy, especially the thickness adjustment, but it works. Biggest complaint is the blade chips incredibly easy. If you slice something all the way down and the plastic guard hits the blade, it chips. As long as you think of it as disposable, it's a fantastic mandolin."
3,Its Adequet but not ideal,"I bought this to handle potatoes mostly but failed to realize the spikes to hold the food on the finger guard were not actually long enough to do so, which was a real pain and ended with me holding the potatoe and slicing my finger fairly deeply. I would suggest thatif you buy this you buy the cutting glove to protect your hand because it will make it easier to work with. Also it doesnt work well on fruit at all, which is a real bummer."
4,Good for the price,"Does the job perfectly for zucchini. It didn't work very well on eggplant, even after I cut it to make it fit within the rails. Do yourself (and your fingertips) a favor and buy protective gloves to go with this. You WILL cut yourself if you don't."
3,Kyocera Adjustable Mandolin,"The Kyocera Adjustable Mandolin slicer is not wonderful. The blade seems uneven or something. Anyway, it doesn't slice except on the thickest setting. The thingamajig that you're supposed to use to hold the vegetable that's being sliced is useless. It slips around. So you have to hold the vegetable (or whatever you're slicing) with your fingers...and risk cutting them. However, it is good for slicing zucchini because you can grasp the stem end--that is, use the stem as a holder--and not worry too much about slicing the ends of your fingers off."
3,proper use,"In order to use this product safely, you must understand that the plastic base is just a guide and not a table or plane that you ""bare down"" on. Using a ""light"" hand (just touching the veggie to the plastic lightly) and slice back and forth quickly being careful not to push down too hard and making sure to slice parallel to the plastic base. (this takes practice). When you get down to the end of the veggie, finish slicing it by hand or use the ends for another purpose ie carve decoratively for a garnish or grate into the recipe.Even if you do use it properly, it is what it is....a $22.00 mandolin. Pro models run from 80 to 200.00 so this cannot be compared to them. Hope this helps and saves a finger or two. Gregg"
5,Cuts Thin,Used The Mandoline to make potatoe chips. You could almost see through them and they were delicious. Good Product
5,The best!,"I read all the possible consumer reports and reviews in Amazon etc, and decided to get a Kyocera mandoline. I love it - find it very sharp and easy to use. It is not very wide, but wide enough e.g. for potatoes. Partially frozen summer sausage sliced well, sweet red peppers, cucumbers etc in a couple of seconds. I am planning to try the potato chips microwave recipe, which I found online. Kyocera is able to cut see through slices! By doing them myself, I can control the sodium level, add spices etc. If using the mandoline for veggies, I usually just rinse it. I have it on the kitchen wall, where it is very convenient to use from and it protects the cutting edge. Maybe I'll ask for the Kyocera Julienne mandoline for next Christmas : )In summary, like someone described it: 'Looks like a toy, works like a dream!'"
4,Great for reading practice at home,"These books are really simple to make in the classroom and give the kids an opportunity to read with their parents at home. The only problem is, some of them are not very interesting. The ones that are great make it worth getting the book."
5,The Improvement Guide,A very clear update of performance improvement process for business. Can be used as an introduction to the concept for newly trained staff and an everyday reference for those working on real projects.
3,Review: The Improvement Guide,"Book deals with improvements in business and work settings. Includes principles of improvement, models, issues of change, and a second part devoted entirely to methods for improvement. This second part is the most valuable. Read parts for ideas and practical applications. There is little here that is new, but the compendium approach is helpful."
4,Reconditioned Unit Functioned but No Instruction Manual,"I bought this rather sophisticated and usually expensive conference phone as a cheaper reconditioned unit, the first time I had bought a reconditioned device. It was delivered in the delays I was told. It had a few scuff marks from prior use -- to be expected -- but did function, the essential thing! My only minor complaint is that no instruction sheet or manual was included, rather an 800 number was provided for user information."
3,Johnny Appleseed: My Story,My granddaughter read this and she thought it was o.k. She is only 7 and is use to reading from actual book so I think reading it from my kindle was just weird to her.
3,A good book,"The only part I didn't like was ""I packed up my gun."" Many other stories about Johnny Appleseed state that he did not carry a gun."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I have seen several documented programs about stigmata, and could hardly believe the poor quality of this dvd, including photography and audio. It is almost inaudioable in many places because of the translation being heard over the narration. It is made up in large part of news footage, and in my opinion, it has less to do with understanding stigmata than the propoganda of stigmata.The content of this production is loosely put together and withoutfocus. This is an expensive item which is not worth the shipping."
4,Soul Food!,"I found this item to be of distinct interest for me since I am fascinated by the subject matter. Whether the events portrayed in this film are real or not, it carries the same message and that is having faith in a higher power. Thousands of people supposedly witnessed this vision of Mary at Fatima and Her message to them and particularly the children who first noted the vision of Mary............The mystery of stigmata has certainly been described in the literature and why, when or how nobody knows, at least, here on this planet. Conjecture yes, proving it, no! Again, for me, it comes down to faith and my belief in a Supreme Being."
3,Took forever to get here,Product performed as advertised but took longer than reasonable to fulfill order and subsequently mail. usally order when one fails so too much down time waiting for the replacement.
4,simple and reliable.,"I bought a pair of these to use for a large mobile robot (R2D2!). They are simple, cheap, and reliable; in short, everything I expected :-) If you are looking for cheap, reliable, and sturdy portable power, this is the ticket. The .25"" QC terminals make it real easy to hook up too."
4,Excellent,Excellent product and it's working as expected. It's been over a year now and still working. I am happy with the product.
1,fios direct replacement,This is not a direct replacement. It's positive and negative terminals are smaller than the original battery that comes with your fios. The battery is made in Vietnam.
5,Price,"The price was very good. I like shopping Amazon.com a lot. I used this inexpensive battery instead of purchasing a new lighting system for my camera, which would have been more than I could afford."
2,short lasting battery,I ordered 5 of these batteries less than 18 months ago and only one is still working. I ended up buying a new APC backup supply which comes with a three year warranty including the battery. I would not recommend these batteries for their short life.
1,Terrible shipping,"Received my batteries today. Other vendors put Sealed Lead Acid batteries into cardboard boxes for shipping. Ecom just uses a singe layer of thin bubble wrap and places them in a Priority Mail envelope.The two batteries arrived dented, cracked and discharged.Now I understand why Ecom can sell them at such a low price.Next time I'll buy from a reputable dealer and avoid Amazon marketplace dealers."
3,Disappointing Battery Life,Purchased two of these for a Battery Backup after its original batteries lasted approximately 3 1/2 years and finally gave up. Worked great for a little over 2 years then just died. These are definitely a lower quality battery than the OEM CGB batteries supplied with the battery backup.The price was right but sadly the performance is lacking.
3,Good information that's out of date,"The book is interesting and has many good ideas and some valuable information. Be aware, however, that the advanced hacks (those dealing with calling the API from your own code) are based on a now obsolete version of the API. So, for example, Hack 62 that tells you how to find that longitude and latitude of an address doesn't tell you that you can accomplish the task via Google now. Hack 58 (Find the right zoom level) has one (of three) technique that uses an undocumented API that has, apparently, gone away. And, of course, it doesn't provide the easy way to do it using the current API.I'm not faulting the authors for not seeing into the future. The book is well written and engaging. Just be aware that parts of it are already out of date."
5,The best Google Maps book,"If you'd like to program or create sites with mapping tools, this book will really help.Short and direct chapters. Easy to read and learn."
1,Quality is not there...,"I bought this for my two children (6,8)for Christmas and they were super-excited because the summer before they had played with a fun roller that was owned by our neighbors. They had enjoyed hours of fun on the fun roller with their neighbor friends and couldn't wait until spring when we could out ours on the yard. However, when spring came and we put it on our soft, green grass it got a hole in it within 2 hours. It was just our two daughters playing with it and I was very disappointed in the lack of quality of the toy. We bought the identical one that our neighbors had and for some reason this one did not last an afternoon and the neighbors lasted an entire summer. Maybe they ""cheapened"" up the quality?? Not sure but it is not a good purchase. Do not waste your time on this toy."
4,So FUN!!,"The kids absolutely love this! It is a ton of fun, inside, outside, or in the pool. I do wish the plastic was thicker so it would hold up longer. Ours lasted a while without getting a hole, and it was easy to patch, but I do wish it was more durable."
5,"Bought 3 just in case, but only needed one.","I read the reviews on this toy, but it was so affordable when I bought it that I picked up 2 extra ones for when the first one broke. Let me say that there is simply NO better value in toys. This toy is so much fun. I still have the 2 extras, and this first one has held up for over a month. I do have to blow it up with my air thingy every day, but it lasts all day long after that."
1,Wouldn't stay inflated,"Very disappointed because it would not stay inflated for the kids to play with. Definitely wouldn't purchase this again. Also, not as big a looks in picture."
1,Had a hole before we blew it up,"We bought this as an Easter present, so the ""Easter Bunny"" stayed up late to get it blown up and ready for the kids to see the next morning. But as soon as it was aired up, we realized that it had a hole. After trying to use the patch kit, it was still leaking. We never got to use it."
4,Granddaughter's Favorite toy,What fun! This is great for indoor fun or the pool. It could puncture if used outside where there may be sharp sticks or rocks. My 3 year old granddaughter loves this.
3,needs care,"I had this toy for my kids for about 4 months; after a harsh summer in cA due to heat exposure it got a hole somewhere - could not find it, so trashed it... the kids loved it though, so just take it indoors where temps fluctuate day/night and remember to do it all the time..."
1,Not worth $40,"This toy was a Christmas gift. It had a hole before New Year's eve. Found the leak and patched it, but now it loses air again. Definitely not worth $40. Going in the trash this week."
1,don't buy it,"I should have listened to the reviews panning this toy. I blew it up and noticed later that it had a slow leak. I didn't call the company because I had it for 3 weeks already and had no receipt. My grandkids, 3 1/2 and 4, didn't even care for it."
3,Period Piece Overload,"I must confess to having read this novel shortly after Youngblood Hawke. As a result, roughly 1,000 pages of 1930-40s New York City dialect and social mores tends to grate after awhile. The result was, that about halfway through the book, I found myself not only failing to care about the ""heroine"", but actually beginning to dislike her quite a bit. Once that point was reached, I simply began to look forward to the end of the book.Perhaps if I'd read it first, it would have created a more favorable impression. As it was, I thought if I read the expletive ""Gad"" one more time, I'd vomit.In a nutshell, the novel follows the adolecent and early adult years of a Jewish American princess in 1930s New York City. Mildly entertaining at first, for me the book dragged and fell into a vicious cycle of relationship and career events that became repetitive at best. I've read most of Wouk's work and for me, this was the weakest."
5,marjorie morningstar,"This was my first 'adult"" novel,and I read it at the innocent age of 15! I learned a lot about the world and love from this book,and also about prejudice. It had been over 36 years since I read it,and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.I may read it again"
3,Mister Misogynist,"I read it twenty years ago, in high school, recently bought it off Alibris and reread it. While I found it charming, albeit a bit of a soap-opera, in high school, I now think that Wouk is some kind of sadistic misogynist. Why does Wally get to have a cool career--and Mike Eden, and Noah, who achieves a little fame--and Marjorie gets to have white hair and a very quiet life by the end of the book? It seems to me Wouk punishes his main character far more than she deserves, or what is literarily necessary. So Marge's dreams are ""silly girl on stage"" dreams, yet Wally's sophomoric jokes for his college revue are the genesis for his later playwriting? I guess girls aren't allowed to dream. I do NOT recommend this book for young females, unless you can convince the girl that there's more to life than waltzing down the aisle. Where I come from, that's still the major goal of far too many of 'em."
2,Not his best,"I was dissatisfied w/Marjorie, HW has better work out there. I've run into few authors who have, in my opinion, successfully/authentically portrayed, or wrote first person narratives as, a main character whose sex was opposite their own (that of the author). There are exceptions, I suppose, but generally speaking, men know men better than women do, and women know women better than men do."
1,Big buildup...silly ending,"First let me say how much I enjoyed reading this book, until the final pages. The ending made me feel so disappointed and cheated that I would demand my money back if this weren't a library book. It feels as if the author just ran out of ideas (or paper) and made up a quick-fix ending in no fashion justified by the previous 500 pages. When I invest my time reading a book, I expect a return, and this book leaves me feeling robbed."
3,slomo,"This would be a great read if one were taking Psy 202 but as such it is slow reading. A great look at the social mores of the '50's and I guess that helps in understanding who we are and where we came from, but other then that a BORE."
3,Kind of Dull,"I read this book when I was a teen and interested in what were called ""coming of age"" novels, though I never thought of them as such: I read them for the story, the character and conflict. I found ""Marjorie Morningstar"" dull. The conflict didn't seem exciting, it was an unnecessarily long book, and Marjorie ended up accepting convention. Dull."
3,Condition,"Received hard copy of book, and it is great condition! Even had library style cellophane cover that kept it in mint condition."
5,One of the best...,books I have ever read. You are able to connect with the characters and feel like you are part of the story. Wouk has a glorious way to write you into the story. I truly never wanted this book to end. It accurately depicts the social climate of the era and leaves you wistful about where Marjories life took her. I think women could find a similar plot with their first true love. Well written---well worth reading.
3,"Decent album, poor recording quality.","Johnny Powers made some fine contributions to the traditional rockabilly music genre. Unfortunately, there evidently were not good quality masters available when this cd was produced. Not a bad purchase, just be forewarned. (And c'mon, do we really need *five* versions of ""Waitin' for You""?)"
5,Excellent Bra.,"My wife said to me that the Maidenform Women's One Fabulous Fit Bra are excellent, they are exactly as she expected."
5,Great bra!,"I found this bra on sale for $7 at TJMaxx a while back and I didn't think I'd like it, but it was such a good deal I thought I'd give it a shot. I ended up loving it! I got it in the black and beige striped print and it's gorgeous! I have gotten so many compliments on it from friends, women at the gym, and my boyfriend (I don't think I've ever gotten complimented on a regular, everyday bra before, only the special occasion stuff). It seems very true to size and is comfy. Unlike some demi bras, the cups are cut low enough that it doesn't show out of the top of scoopneck shirts or tank tops. Another think I love about it is that the strap adjustment ring is in the front, not in the back, so it's easy to adjust perfectly, with out having to call in a friend for help lol. Definitely recommended."
1,"Horrible - Sizes are too big, and they don't exchange","Maidenform's bra was labeled the correct size, but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length, and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit. They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges. They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support."
2,"Same style number, but different fit","I owned other bras with this style number, and assumed this one would be the same. But somehow the cups are cut lower. Otherwise it's fine. Also the picture doesn't show the leopard print."
2,buy bras in the store not online,"I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store, yet the one I ordered online didn't fit me well. Also, withina month, the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked."
2,Do not buy if you have a bit,"This is definetely not for the medium to big chested. Very uncomfortable, almost no support."
4,Probably my favorite bra,"This is a great bra. It's comfortable and provides good support. I also like the shape of it. It comes down low enough so I can wear lowcut tops without the cups peeking out. It also doesn't ride up my back, which is a plus. I've had that problem before.My only complaint is that after a while (say, a few months), it does start to stretch out a little bit, so it's not as supportive as it was in the beginning. That said, I really like this bra and I continue to buy it simply because I haven't found any other bras that I like as much as this one."
5,"Like a glove, ladies!","One Fabulous Fit in the tailored demi style is my everyday bra. Great fit and support, just really soft and comfortable. These bras hold their shape and last a long time. They're super smooth, no lumps and bumps under clothes and the Beige color is the greatest under white tops, doesn't show through at all. I'm a petite girl and Maidenform as a whole seems to be a good match for me. I have a few of their other styles as well, but this is the one I always come back to and have for years. Highly recommended!"
2,Not what it used to be......,"Maidenform style #7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape. I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price. I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store. This new style is an oddly molded half bra that doesn't look natural under clothing - creating points where there shouldn't be any. I've worn the same size and style for many years, and this product did not live up to the standard."
4,Affordable Comfort,"It isn't easy to find a bra for the smaller adult woman. This is a very affordable bra that fits well, and is stylish. It comes in several colors, patterns and of course basic white and black. It has just a thin padding and no seams, perfect when wearing t-shirts, light clothing or anything kind of outerwear."
4,Good value for the money,Very happy with it and better quality than I thought I would get for the money. Colors can fade on hose ends.
5,Worth the wait!,"I have waited many months for this book - the sequel to The Book of Shadows, which I loved. I have to say the wait was worth it. The Book of Spirits continues to tell the story of Herculine, this time in America in the early 1800's. Lots of history here, plenty of ""other-worldliness"", and a story that kept me turning the pages. Anne Rice, who is quoted on the front of the book, is right. It is wonderful to have James Reese exploring and transcending the gothic genre."
3,Not elegant like the first one,"I found this story to be more focused on gore than on storyline or characterisation. Hurculine is in Virginia now and there are some interesting characters but none of them are as fleshed out as they should be. Book Of Shadows was far more elegant in prose and left haunting imagery in my head. This one seems a little flat. Still an interesting story, but not as good as the first."
2,Disappointing...,"I had so enjoyed The Book of Shadows, and this just didn't do it for me. I found the Kindle version to be really peculiarly transcribed, with a lot of mistakes, strange punctuation and words run together. And I found it to be troublesome to read: clearly densely researched, but written in such a way that the historical facts disturbed the telling of the tale and broke the flow of the story. It was the first book in a long time that I finished in order to finish it and not because it was giving me pleasure, and even the ending I found flat - like maybe he was doing the same thing!"
1,Dissapointing doesn't even come close...,"My god, this album is a disgrace. I heard Logan Mader was in a new band, and I was psyched to say the least, but when I hear this CD, I was all but in tears. The riffs are non-existent, something I was especially dissapointed by (it's Logan friggin' Mader for Christs sake!), the songs are just wanky drones, sounding more like Placebo than any decent music. I tried and tried to like this CD, but I couldnt. Avoid this like the plague (as if a band with Whitfield Crane out front needs a warning!)."
4,Fun to Fly,"I bought this toy for my 8 year old son. The paper is very colorful and good quality for folding. Like a lot of origami, directions can be a little difficult for some kids to follow. Although my son did ask for help a couple of times, I found the directions and diagrams fairly clear. Beware of the misleading line ""Make 18 airplanes!"" While there is indeed 18 sheets of paper, the instruction booklet contains directions for only 6 different kinds of planes. The planes really do fly and hold up pretty well. It was a good buy for the money."
5,Fold N Fly Paper Airplanes,"My 5 yr old loves the paper airplanes. Although I had to make them for him, he loved the finished product. The instructions were very easy to follow which made it fun for me too."
3,Okay but not a favorite,"My grandson launched into this kit without help (he's 10), but was not satisfied with his results. He's bright and methodical so should have been able to do the planes without help, but his results, although they looked reasonable, didn't fly well so he lost interest.The paper is good quality and attractively patterned, and later I folded a couple of sheets into the traditional paper airplane style (without looking at the directions). My planes flew as well or better than ones made from ordinary copy paper and were good looking, but not exciting enough to encourage any of us to make more.Since the paper is heavier than copy paper, it would seem you could get a plane that would fly better outside than one made with standard paper, so if you're into paper airplanes (whatever your age) this set of bright paper sheets might provide a fun alternative to standard paper. Making a good one seems to take a deft hand, however."
4,Airplanes,I got this for my 7 year old nephew and I was happy with the product. It is alot if fun for boys as well as girls.
5,Great,Great gift for my son. The price was great and i also received my order within a week of placing it. Would definitly recommend.
2,This is NOT a kit...just paper with no fold lines,"This item says its for a 6+ year old, but there is NO WAY a 6 year old could follow these directions because there are NO FOLD LINES on the paper. The ""kit"" is just sheets of brightly colored paper and 1 sheet of stickers. VERY disappointed that this was mislabeled, and definitely not worth the price."
2,Terrible instructions,"I bought this for our grandchildren, ages 5 & 6, and how frustrating it was for them. The paper is good quality but it makes it difficult for little ones to make the folds once they get beyond the basics. I would say don't even read the instructions just follow the pictures as best you can."
2,Not quite what we expected...,"I purchased this product for my 8 year old nephew. He loves following along w/ You Tube vids and making paper planes, hats, and boats. For the price, I figured we'd try it. What I found disappointing was that the instruction booklet is quite small and not very kid friendly. My nephew really enjoys reading and following directions on his own. Even when he enlisted the help of an adult, it just didn't hold his interest. The paper is great quality and does indeed have awesome decorations. The kit itself was pretty underwhelming. It is sheets of the decorative paper, loose in a box, with a very dry looking, small instruction book. Maybe if the instruction booklet were bigger and had some color pics?In the end, he's got some cool paper to use for other projects. Probably would not purchase this item again."
5,great,The kids enjoyed it and that's all I care about. It's a great activity to do along with them... enjoy!
4,Old school fun with creative twist,"A spin on old school airplanes, allows kids to use imagination and be creative. Keeps them entertained for hours, good buy."
5,Kids loved the Paper airplanes,Kept them busy on Christmas day !! Easy and fun & inexpensive passtime.Would buy them again for other kids.
2,complicated,"The paper is really nice and colorful, but the instructions are hard to follow because they are just pictures and it's hard to tell which way the paper needs to be folded."
5,Rod Stewart's Second Album Is Great,"GASOLINE ALLEY is Rod Stewart's second great album in a row. From the opening title track, which pays homage to his roots, to the Small Faces' ""My Way Of Giving"", to Bobby Womack's ""It's All Over Now"" and Bob Dylan's ""Only A Hobo"", this album shows Stewart as a working-class rocker, equally at home with the blues/R&B/soul styles of Memphis, Chicago, Texas, St. Louis, Muscle Shoals, and Detroit, and with American and British Isles folk music. All of his first four albums are worth getting at once, along with THE MERCURY ANTHOLOGY, ATLANTIC CROSSING, A NIGHT ON THE TOWN, FOOTLOOSE & FANCY FREE, TONIGHT I'M YOURS, VAGABOND HEART, UNPLUGGED...AND SEATED, SPANNER IN THE WORKS, and WHEN WE WERE THE NEW BOYS- preferably all at once."
4,Still flying,"Purchased for my father, a Korean Vet., to replace a similar destroyed by a wind storm. Went up 5 minutes after opening, and is still there. I did notice that before the last possible chance of windy conditions, the flag was down and in the foyer. Old Dogs and New Tricks perhaps!"
1,not what i expected,NO FITTING TO HOOK TO PLUMING AND COULD FIND THAT AT HOME DEPOT OR ANY OF THE LOCAL PLUMMING STORES
1,15 minutes worth of entertainment,I think the title says it all. My 9 and 6 year old didn't find it interesting at all. They became frustrated with it almost immediately.
3,Coochy cream,"The green tea fragrance is good (and not too strong), but texture is a little too thin. When applying, it wants to roll off the skin. It's very much like hair conditioner. Guess I'll use it for that."
2,Incomprehensible sound track,"The 2009 release lacks English (or any other) captioning; the heavy, working-class Australian accents make ""Newcastle"" annoyingly difficult to follow. Not recommended, unless you know the lingo or have a good ear plus first-class playback equipment."
2,Slow little boring and uneventful,"There is some nice eye candy in the film but that's abou it. Slow paced script, the events in the timeline are almost glosed over and underdeveloped characters. Not even worth a rental"
2,"Great Scenary and Surfing Film, Lacking Depth","So I picked this up as it was recommended based on my interest in gay themed films. Interesting. It's definitely shy in the gay content. However, if you're looking for a film with great surfing, lovely scenary, a few hot surfer dudes ad ample butt shots, watch this film. It was cute, but I won't be hurrying to watch it a second time.The plot goes something like this: a bunch of surfer dudes compete for a big title. 4 guys chase 2 girls, while 1 guy chases another guy. 3 older surfer dudes don't like the younger ones. They challenge them and tragedy strikes. An attempt at getting deep at this part is lost in the overall lightness of the film.I don't know much about surfing, but I hope it's not this mean-spirited of a sport. I don't think it is. Really not much else to say."
1,WORST AUSTRALIAN FILM EVER,The dud bombed badly in Australian cinemas .The local critics hated it.A very tedious film that goes nowhere and would have to be the most boring film ever to emerge from that country.A good looking cast doesn't help when the script is woeful.It's Australian dvd release came and went without a whisper and it was sold for very cheap price.Probably only the cast were desperate enough to want to buy a copy.You have been warned
1,NEWCASTLE,"A dumb movie, no sex scenes at all. Almost a 'chick flick' really not worth any amount of money. boring."
4,"Great surfer, dude movie!","If you love surfers or surfing and are gay then this movie is for you. The surfers are hot but it's not really a gay movie. If fact there is only homoeroticism in this flick. Don't look for any same-sex ""brokeback"" moments. It's a very believable tale of just kids coming-of-age with a beach back drop. The plot is simple but doesn't get boring. I didn't give it 5stars b/c I am gay and I was hoping the outsider would come ""out"" in the movie but I didn't come ""out"" when I was their age. Unlike ""Shelter"", there's actual surfing in the flick."
4,Original,What can I say? It's the original soundtrack to the hit TV series of my youth and today's new and updated screen version. Still great tunes.
5,"Review of ""FAME"" soundtrack","I used this soundtrack--in LP form--many years ago when I first started teaching dance. This summer I used it as part of a dance history class. I used this music for the American Jazz Dance/Broadway Style section of the class, and my elementary age students had to create original choreography to the theme song--in the style of Bob Fosse. The music was appropriate for my theme and the age level of the students. After all these years, it's still catchy."
3,Interesting theme,Interesting theme. Unfortunatley the author repeats herself regularly and makes to much use of cliches.
4,Great resource for those new to job analysis!,Easy read and well organized material. The facilitator's guide is useful. I especially liked the evaluation of other job analysis methods. The evaluation list the pros and cons of methods such as DACUM. This helped me cut and paste techniques from several methods which made more sense for my situation.
3,Job Analysis at the Speed of Reality,HR and business managers will find this book useful. It is full of important information and the writing moves along at a good pace. I would recommend its reading to my managers.
4,Spookie Daly Pride is a fun ride!,"I saw Spookie Daly Pride perform as the opening act for Arrested Development on July 26th, 2004. Their music is fun, fresh and unique and their stage show is awesome. You can't help smiling and dancing to their music. They truly looked like they were having a fun time performing and their smiles are infectious (especially that of the guitarist), as is their music. I particularly like the song ""Marshmallow Pie"" and ""Happy Happy."" If you like music that is a blend of different styles, unlikely instruments and can be classified as ""Happy Music,"" you'll love Marshmallow Pie and Spookie Daly Pride."
3,"BEAUTIFUL wooden front frame and logo, but terrible picture sleeves","The product looked EXTREMELY nice from the outside, but when I opened the album the photo sleeves were extremely crinkled. They were of such bad quality that when I placed a picture inside I could barely see it due to all of the light that reflected off of the crinkles! My item may have been a defect, but I asked for a refund."
3,Visually Impressive But Slightly Off The Mark,"Xinghua is the wife of a local grocer - the village bigshot - largely because he owns a truck, and who makes extra money by selling stones from the nearby Great Wall (not the one in Beijing, but the one Nixon did not in fact think you could see from space). When Xinghua cannot bear him a child, she is beaten and humiliated, and seeks love elsewhere in the form of a young educated man living on a mountain who plants trees to conserve the soil. It's a good premise but somehow the film falls short of expectation. The character of Xinghua is a good commentary on the role of women in rural and feudal China earlier this century, but it's clichéd in delivery. Visually well-done though, and finding out why Xinghua can't give her husband the son he wants so badly is also a high point, but as to what that reason is, well you'll just have to watch for yourself! :)"
3,Lackluster pseudo-Indian tea,"My friend shared Indian tea with me, which was THE BEST, smooth, quickly brewing tea, I have ever had. This lacks what I expected."
4,The night is calling . . .,"This isn't some parent of goth rock, don't believe the hype; The Lords of the New Church at the time was still breathing the clean, fresh fetid air of punk rock. Side One, I must say since the record is so damn obscure, is a tour de force of moody, wickedly crafted rock 'n roll. You can see where a cat like Roland S. Howard got his chops listening to this. But the spirit of '79 is still alive in here. I played this straight up tonight after ""London Calling"" and it wasn't a tough move. Stiv comes from punk, but he's got his Bunnymen and he probably has got his Doors. The DJ in me said, next up, late-model Siouxee and the Banshees. The record is terrific, and it's becoming a lost night player. Highly recommended."
2,It really depends on what you want.,"I am very disappointed in this film. Mostly because it seems like it is talking about two different subjects at the same time. On the one hand, the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology, who fairly effectively trace the history and progression of postmodern thought. On the other hand, there are the two film makers who simply discuss their unhelpful and sometimes irrelevant to the discussion ideas.The brothers Williamson are asking questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more to do with their own personal dissatisfaction with the church. It's like they made this film to throw out their own ideas and advertised it as a film on postmodernism. While some of the interviews with the experts are helpful in clarifying trends in postmodern thought, this video as whole is unhelpful as a whole."
4,Thought provoking,"Worth buying. Thought provoking. Helps you to understand not only what Modernism, Post Modernism and Relativism are, but also makes you think about what the future holds for a society that is believin there are no absolute truths."
3,A Hollywood Jesus Reel People Review,"Length:: 5:23 MinsThis video review was produced with a live audience at Set Free Fellowship in Medford Oregon. Generally they thought the first 30 minutes was tedious (some thought boring) but were okay with the film after that. They connected with the premise that the church is not doing a good job at connecting to the ""post-modern culture""."
3,Broken bear,"I put up my bear. He looked real cute until I grabbed some toilet paper for use, it fell and broke. The metal plate that adheres to the bear came off and stayed on wall."
4,Works well so far,"This is the only type of trimmer I have used for my dogs, but it seems to work as well as possible. We wanted something that would last - not plastic and knew the quick-finding trimmers were a gimmick. This seems like it will last for a very long time, and I would have given it five stars if the handles felt better in your hand. They are a bit short and thin-feeling (rounded with a hollow back, as shown in the picture), but the trimmer gets the job done. If it ever does break, I will seek out a more professional quality trimmer."
5,"Mike Hammer, Private Eye","Recieved this item as a gift from my daughter since she knows I like the older police/detective shows. Naked City, Mannix, etc. I had never watched the show when it was on network television. This boxed set is great. Enjoyable to watch, comical spots but with well written plots. A great deal at this price."
1,bad continuation of original series,"unfortunately, this continuation lacked all of the humor and originality of the 1st go round. the addition of a sidekick and the secretary's increased role didn't work. many of the plot devices are just stupid."
5,in some ways better than James Bond,"I really like Mike Hammer. I know him since I was young and watched every episode from the first run. Unfortunately this box contains only the stories from the second series, showing Mike in a more ""civilized"" way, with much fewer contacts to women (compared to earlier films), not such cool as in the first stories and only sometimes having a confrontation with the chief lawyer. However, this box is strongly recommended to people liking the ideas of M.Spilane and also Stacy Keach. The gimmicks complete the 26 films in a perfect way and the interview answers lot of questions, Hammer fans may have (who is the lady, he sees in every episode etc). I still hope that hte first films will also be released on DVD soon... In the meantime: Just buy this set and enjoy!"
3,Fast read,Caroline seemed psycho . Who would really chase after someone like that? Still a fast read that I couldn't out down waiting for her next psycho move
3,There was nothing wrong with this book.,"Everyone was wonderful, the heroine was a paragon of virtue, confidence and caring. The hero was true to his ideals, his parents and the memory of his dead wife.All of the secondary characters were fine, upstanding, independent people, and there's not a darn thing wrong with that. The one exception is the heroine's mother, but that's ok, because her mother helped shape who she is now, and now she's wonderful. I felt like I was reading a fairy-tale written for a blue-haired ladies reading circle... not there's anything wrong with that. The emphasis was on living for today. The secondary storyline revolved around the vicissitudes of life that can take a strong marriage and make it shake. I'm sure some people will totally love this story, but I like my romance a bit more realistic, and a bit more focussed on the main couple."
3,"yes, yes, bsb is back...hopefully for the last time","bsb is back...*sigh* and by next year one of em will die of an overdose and one will be put in jail for not paying child support. but 9-14 year old girls and homo guys...enjoy em. maybe in like 2 years everyone will be ""omg omg omg bsb is back!"" pssh go listen to some Foo Fighters. Or if you insist on this bubblegum pop music try THE CLICK FIVE they're pretty hot."
5,bsb rules,"Backstreet boys have 7 albums my favourite is: Millennium. Incomplete was there first single from there new album: Never gone.I went to see them at the belle center on september 13th 2005 for there Never gone tour.My favourite album is Millennium because its a beautiful perfect album and have great songs on it. I am there number 1 fan, no other people like the Backstreet boys better than me , my cousin and my brother. FROM A BIG BSB FAN ADAM!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not Complete,"For The Backstreet Boys, they've let their times of harmonies take a backseat for at least five years, while dealing with problems like alcoholism, and solo projects in the mend. Nevertheless, they still had each other, and their latest single does showcase their reunion. Incomplete, the first single from their comeback album, Never Gone, is a very soft ballad, but something a little tiresome after awhile. The song is good for a spell, by bringing each of those five harmonies together. Nevertheless, it still doesn't measure up their other ballads like Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely. Incomplete still is a good song, but not their best.Song: C+"
5,Strong Comeback!,"The average person is way too harsh when it comes to rating BSB music. Not everyone is going to like their style. That's why there's other music out there. If you don't like this music, then be on your way. I have a diverse taste when it comes to music. I like Led Zepplin, Johnny Cash, Black Eyed Peas, Eminem plus many more. But, when BSB release something, I buy it no matter what. The reason behind this is because I have NEVER been let down by an album of their's. I've heard the entire album, Never Gone, and I am so glad that they have reunited to record these songs. The song, Incomplete, is just one of many gems on the upcoming CD. If you were a fan before, you'll continue to be one after listening to ""Never Gone."" To all the haters out there, go listen to the same stuff you've always listened to and don't TRY to dampen the talents of actual singers. Because actual singers are hard to find these days."
5,Shellhoder,Nice. It is just what I wanted.It is very easy to use.And I would recommend it to others.I am very happy.
3,A bit on the lame side,I really wish I could give this a glowing review. I had great respect for Reggie White for his outspoken faith in the often irreverent world of the NFL. Acting was not his forte. This story was several notches to the left of realistic. And there was not much emphasis on God after the first few scenes. The professional feel of the movie does not come close to overcoming the faults of the script and the acting.
2,Reggie's Prayer DVD,"I bought this for a Christmas gift and when I got it there was no plastic on it and when you turned it over it said it was a used copy, so I had to order another one to use because I certainly couldn't give a used DVD to someone for Christmas. Very disappointed."
3,Nice Story Line,"Ok, since i am forced to write a certain number of words i am just filibustering, acting not so great, but nice story"
3,It was okay,"I purchased this book because I wanted to read of the life of Phil Spector. It was a good read, but contained a lot of technical ""jargon"" regarding his producing that I really didn't understand. I would have appreciated more of the personal side of his life."
4,Lightweight Protection,Its so light that I almost forget that I have it on. I can wear my glasses under it and it doesn't fog up.Even when you are working on your back the face plate remains in position.
1,garbage pan/scans,"barely viewable pan/scans with blurred,clipped pictureslisting should have a warning re collection of garbage printssound dropouts as well frequently"
5,Body Image Workbook,"I strongly recommend this workbook for anybody struggling with an eating disorder, especially good for working with in therapy."
5,a,For a client. Very informative and encouraged to recognize and talk about her feelings without feeling too awkward. Very good.
3,Poorly written.,If you can muddle through the confusing writing there are some good insights. Would I buy it again? Probably not.
2,Not much in this for me,"Maybe I am just too lazy to do the work, but I didn't get much from this workbook"
3,Lots of elves but no passion,"First of all, let me just say that I'm not the biggest fan of elves and abhor elf-worship in books. That said, good writing in what I read is what matters more regardless of the inclusion of elves or the lack of. I gave three stars cuz in listing and describing the elf types, the book does a good job but at times it read like butter spread too thin over too much bread and doesn't dig in that extra inch to hold my attention. The forest where the story takes place in was a little too fantastical and didn't mesh with the grim feel of the Warhammer world. Almost felt like I was in never, never land rather than the Old World at times. Plus the main character, Leofric allowed himself to be pushed around too much for a veteran Knight of Brettonia. I couldn't respect him and so couldn't feel fo him. Author must've been given too much to cover in one book."
5,Tight as hell!,"I can't believe somebody finally made a rap album where I never have to hit the skip button on my cd player. I've had the album for 2 weeks and I listen to it daily, the whole way through. Even if you're not that into hip-hop i think you may still like this album. Mos Def puts phony sellouts like Jay-Z and DMX to shame."
3,Soulfull voices and innovative beats but limited rhymes,Expectations fall slightly short as far as his creation of metaphors that you can continually tap new meaning from. Singling out whites as the cause for racisism won't solve the problem. His voice delivers his soul and he takes beats to a new level but I don't keep this CD in heavy rotation. Continue to expand awareness.
5,mos def is one of the best artiests of the decade,mos def suprised me on how good a rapper he is and he is damn good mos def matchs up to biggie and 2pac on his lyrical skills this album is sweet
4,Mighty Mos Def,"Afro-Centric? Yes..Worldly YEs.. Political? Yes.. Is it music for all to listen to? Yes.. Heart felt? Yes... Mos Def's Best work? Hmmm yet to be seen.. I wanna hear this Cats Rock album and his JAzz Ablum.. oh and he can act somewhat.. But you gotta laugh when you see him in the Micheal Jackson Video MOvie ""Ghost""? i think.. anyway.. I like Him and you should too..MOs is creative, soulful, and Aware.. let him take you there in this Album...bonis...."
5,HIS best.,"he has like 4 or five albums, i've heard em all. this is the best of em to me. need i say mo"
5,The Savior of Hip Hop,"It's unbelievable how tight this cd is. A true showing of how hip-hop can be very artistic as well as entertaining. Mos Def's lyrics are incredible and matched by no other. All the tracks will make your head nod for sure. Best cuts: The whole album. If you don't have it, GET IT. All those who have been disenchanted with music lately will find happiness with this joint. A staple in my cd collection. Always in my stereo, PC, and everywhere else. Best hip-hop album of the year.....of the decade!"
5,Don't read any more reviews on it...Just buy it!,"Seriously. This is quality listening. The vulnerability, the creativity, the lyrics...did I mention the lyrics? I love this CD. Fear Not of Man almost brings me to tears because I have to constantly remind myself that God makes me valuable. My favorites are Fear Not of Man, Hip Hop, Got, Umi Says, Rock N ROll, Climb, Mr. Nigga, and May-December. I love the whole CD. As a matter of fact, I probably have to buy it again becasue mine skips too much from being overplaying it. It's 2004 already and this is still in heavy rotation. What more can I say?"
5,Not WACK on any side,"To everybody who's already heard of the mighty Mos Def, you don't need me to explain a whole lot. Mos Def comes with hip hop, blues, jazz, and rock elements in this album that all blend brilliantly for a surprisingly diverse album. Most of the songs are of the hip-hop flavor, but on ""Rock and Roll"" Mos makes an interesting point about the music genre that the title mentions. In either case, one of hip hop's (and music as a whole) most talented artists offers a well rounded album that will make you bob your head, raise an eyebrow or two, and even pick up your air guitar. A must have for any real hip-hop head."
5,i cant believe,"this album got an average on here less than 5 stars. you people must be stupid givin this album anything less than 5 stars. this is up there with illmatic, cuban linx, 36 chambers, low end theory, all the greats. just stop it. this is one of the best albums of ALL TIME"
5,A classic for all times.,"""Black on Both Sides"" is THE best hip-hop album that I have ever heard. Intellectual lyrics, nice beats, and a tight flow will have you hittin' rewind more than a few times. There isn't one weak track on this album. An instant classic. Peace."
5,Powerful hip hop and deeply soulful music.,"It's not too fair to make value judgements on aesthetic criterion, but if you judge music on insight, composition, and soul, I guarantee that you will enjoy this album.Most Def's album makes the case for hip hop as more than a set of rigid genre-bound rules; his is not an album with a couple of hit singles wrapped in a bunch of filler and produced with an eye for the latest hip hop trend. Rather, he opens his heart and mind and scoops-out a helping of how he feels. Fortuntely, he's intelligent enough to convey these feelings as though he's pugged right into your head.Of course, if lyrics and flow were all this album were about, you could just read the lyrics from a page. The album takes you from breakbeats to acid jazz through what has to be called modern blues music. Almost no tracks fit the commercial radio production mold.Great music, even for the non-headz."
5,TIGHT AND INSPIRED,"Excellent album.Mos Def is the man! He's smart and he has charm.Sadly those two words have become an oxymoron in the world of rap.But Mos is a tight lyrcist and he actually says something.I'm writing this because last night ""Umi Says"" suddenly poppedinto my head.That song is really nice and really picked up my day.The only downside was that it was used in a Jordan commerical but I can't found Mos for trying to get a little bank.If you don't own ""Black On Both Sides"",try to get it,it'sa really serious album.Stop melting your brain away with thatmindless dribble that's played on the radio."
5,BLACK ON BOTH SIDES,"I HAVE EXPERIENCE MOST DEF AT A CONCERT IN DC AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY, THE BROTHER IS SO DEEP, HE IS WHAT RAP IS AND SHOULD BE TODAY. HE IS THE MOST POSITIVE BLACK MALE RAP ARTIST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. MAY HIS MUSIC AND HE MESSAGE GO ON FOREVER! ~PEACE~LOL~ALWAYS~CARMEN~"
5,Love it!,"I listen to this CD over and over and over again! Mos says so much and he is so creative! If you love Hip Hop, you'll love this CD...."
5,mighty mos def,"this album is DEFINENTLY one of my favorites. i liked it so much i even bought the censored album.. and the instrumental album. the only difference on the censored album is that the track ""brooklyn"" isnt on it. some bozo gave this album 1 star because he got confused about the track listing... i cant believe he gave this album 1 star.. dont be fooled by this shwag, this album is definently worth your money. also check out blackstarr and soundbombnig 2"
5,Nothing I like more than an INTELLIGENT BLACK MAN,and Mos Def is the epitome of one....this too stayed in ridiculously heavy rotation when I first bought it....he is and always will be my hiphop knight in shining black armor!
4,all together a nice album,I really like this album. Awsome beats and great lyrics by the one and only Mos Def. But as most of you know who own this album after a while this gets old but still thats not a reason not to get this. Its still well worth the money. Also if you like this get Kweli's CD and Black Star(my favorite on by these guys)Go get it.
4,Quiet Excellence,"This is, by far, the best hip hop album of 1999. It's quiet meditation is a nice change of pace from the glitz and generic big beats topping the charts right now... but more than once it has offended many of my white friends. Songs like Rockn'Roll seem to quietly point fingers at white musicians for being unoriginal. It is sad how the style began as a crossover between black and white artists now has dissolved into a pissing contest. It is sad that artists like RL Burnside get may not get their due. But the Rolling Stones have, on numerous occasions, shown their appreciation for the roots of rock (jamming with BB King, etc). . ."
3,mos def-inetly,"mos def is definetly one of the best lyricist out there. i know a lot of you guys are going to hate me for saying, but i really didn't like this album.i like his lyrics, but sometimes im not feeling mos on this one.a lot of people said before this album came out ""i cant wait for mos def and talib kweli to come out with solo's"", and ""mos def and talib kweli are tight in blackstar"" (you could see my rating on blackstar if you want) so i decided to buy ""black on both sides"" because of all this hype. and i wasn't satisfied. i think mos def is way better in black star. i know a lot of peolpe wont agree with this review, but it's my opinion and respect like i respect everyone else's.i know a lot of you hip-hop heads are going to buy this album and love it, so you should go buy it, i think im alone on giving this album 3 stars.but hey thats me."
5,the best album of the year and the best since outkast,"the best album since last years outkast album and the best solo album since nas first ...simply the best... if you looking for music that is thought provoking, innovative, artistic, profound..,,ect..,, look no further... mos def represented..."
5,Phat - reminiscent of early 90' hip-hop...,"...those yearning for the sound, the vibe, the consciousness of hip hop's ""Golden Age"" will be taken down memory lane. While not as off-the-wall as De La, or as head-bobbin as Tribe or the JB's, this album is packed with smooth beats, great lyrics, and most importantly-good subject matter! What impresses me is that Mos Def consistently ""rhymes"" globally rather than just about NY, although he big ups the BK frequently which he should! Don't sleep kids, pick it up..."
4,"Excellent, but not without problems","This is a phat disc, no two ways about it. Mos Def is one of the smartest, tightest MCs in hip-hop today. Most of this disc is awesome. I wish I could give it five stars. But listen to Rock N Roll. It's not just the stupid message that all white musicians are biting off underappreciated black ones that really gets me. It's the fact that he ends with a TERRIBLE pseudo-punk riff that sounds like a weak ripoff of... and this is the ridiculous irony... the BEASTIE BOYS.Sorry Mos... otherwise a great album."
3,"Mos Def didn't bring it, most definatly","I got mad love for Mighty Mos, but this CD, i felt, didnt give me the Mos Def element that i heard before. A lot softer and only some songs realy made me bump my head. Rock n Roll?? i have no idea about that song, im sorry, but I'm just a bit dissapointed. Others may respect this more than im tring to. Either way its worth listening to. just to figure if u like it or not. Black Star was better."
5,pure hip hop,This is probably one of the greatest hip hop albums to come out with in the last 10 years. Truly a great listen from beginning to end. Mos exploited all his gifts on this album. He will go down as one of hip hop's true craftsmen. I hope Mos drops another album soon cause the game really needs to hear from this cat.
5,The Soul of Hip-Hop,"Mos Def is a Hip-Hop artist of unparalleled dimensions. I had been disenchanted with the state of rap music and hip-hop for sometime and had been longing for a performer that really explored the deeper aspects of Blackness. I felt that rap & hip-hop had become fixated on anti-female lyrics and the lowest common denominator. ....Then I became acquainted with ""Black on Both Sides"" by Mos Def.Mos Def has created something original on the record entitled ""Black on Both Sides."" This Brotha eloquently raps about Black People, the World and other Social Issues in a very profound manner. He alternates between rapp'n and sing'n while infusing incredible music to his message....the results are simply out of this world.The conscious of the Hip-Hop community resides within Mos Def, an incredible artist and a man to respect. He wears his Blackness on his sleeve and it shines brightly...."
5,Hip Hop For Everyone,"This is bar none one of the greatest albums I have ever owned. This is real hip hop. Great lyrics, great beats, great messages. It is refreshing to hear a rapper rap about actual issues.Even if you are a fan of Eminem, Jay-Z, 2pac, or Ludacris (I know I like all of the above) I think this album will impress you.If you have heard and like Blackstar, KRS, Pharoahe Monch, De La Soul, and others, then DEFINATELY COP THIS ALBUM.This is a hip hop classic. The only cd that has spent more time in rotation in my stereo is 2pac's greatest hits, and that record wont last for long ;)."
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like The Roots, you will love dead prez music also. so check that out to!!","Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as it is similar in a way as they all are very good friends as seen in chapelles block party. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's ""Block Party"" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice & More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com & @ Your Local Record Shops"
5,Damn please,"Ok, First..Mos Def aint the best rapper in 25 years, they're much much better emcees out there. For example, Jedi mind Tricks, Mr.Lif, Virtuoso, Kweli, and Dead Prez. Second, 98% of the rap game aint about cars and Jewels, maybe if you got your f***ing head out your @$$ you'll know that. Black on both sides was an ill CD, got some tight songs on their like ""Know that"" ""Do It Now"" ""Mathematics"" and more. Get this f***ing CD"
4,Very Original,"With all that gangsta hard-driving rap out there, it is nice to occasionally take a break and listen to someone who almost sounds old-school at times. The melodic voice chanting the raps over the great music below reminds me at times of groups like Arrested Development (not that the sounds are all that similar). And the lyrics have that same back to the earth appeal that Arrested Development does as well. I think one of my favorite songs is Rock 'N Roll which just has a great sound to it and a really catchy hook. Overall I think this is the most original rap record I've heard in a long time."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"This is an excellent album for a solo debut, regardless of genre, but I gave it only 3 stars for a specific reason. A lot has been made of Mos Def singing and playing instruments on his album. I enjoyed ""Umi Says"" until I saw him perform it on Conan O'Brien. It was the worst vocal performance I've ever heard off of television. Moby has a better singing voice. Anyways, the first three tracks, plus ""Mr. Nigga"" and ""Numbers"" are some the best hip hop tracks I've ever heard, but a lot of the rest of the album gets soft-pedaled by uninteresting beats, and I don't really care if he did play some instruments. He's benefiting from an absurd double standard that applies to hip hop 'musicians'. He can say what he wants about the Rolling Stones, but at least they could play their instruments well. On a final note, that closing instrumental isn't hip hop, it's muzak. I wouldn't give this album such a harsh review, but his criticisms of other artists begs a closer look at his own music."
3,seriously?,"i suppose if you had listened to this without hearing black star first you'd think it was awesome! instead, this is a pretty lackluster album with some dope dope songs (hip hop, ms. fat booty) and a TON of garbage. the good tracks on here definitely make it worth owning, but you'd be better off getting the black star album or early talib kweli."
2,didn't like it,This CD was a disappointment. I have misplaced it since I bought it.... and I am not sorry.
1,"MOS DEF, Black on Both Sides","After listening to Ms.Fat Booty and reading a review that extolled the excellence of this album, I immediately rolled to Circuit City and picked up this album. Immediately, I was disappointed. Rap has gone to a sorry state if this is being celebrated as one of the best albums of the year. I can not understand how one can go to doing a brilliant song like Ms. Phat Booty to this awful album. I think Mos Def is a talented young man. I just don't know where he went wrong in this album. Also, why did he try to sing on this album. The rhymes might be tight but the production just isn't there."
3,Good Ol 80's Music,"Ok, its an average cd. The band themselves are quite scary looking throughout the lyric book. However I love the song ""Be Near Me"", which I why I purchased the disc. The remix of the song is very dance-y and catchy, and I actually like the remixes better than the originals. If you love 80's music, this is for you. And overall I'm happy with my purchase. Plus I received this cd in 2 days! Good job to the Amazon shipping department! AA+++"
1,Easily the worst from Fry,"ABC's third album sees them morphing into a kitsch cartoon band with two weirdo session players to complete the wacky look. Their ballads, such as ""Be Near Me"" and ""Ocean Blue,"" wear well, but the rest is mostly noisy garbage and the four bonus remixes the CD adds just prolong the problem. ""A to Z"" is head-shakingly bad, and overall this is easily the worst thing Fry's ever involved himself with."
5,Underrated 80's Pop,"I was a teenager in the late 70's and early 80's and consider myself quite the connoisseur of new wave and early 80's pop. The singles ""How To Be A Millionaire"" and ""Be Near Me"" are worth the price of purchase for this CD. In my opinion, ""How To Be A Millionaire"" is a very underrated pop single from the early 80's and I don't understand why you don't hear it with all of the 80's retro going on now. You often hear ""Be Near Me"" in the 80's retro radio programming now. And then there is ""So Hip It Hurts"", a very campy but still very funky dance track that still makes me want to dance.ABC had a unique sound with the vocals of Martin Fry and Eden. And I think their work on this particular album has stood the test of time pretty well. Much more so than some 80's albums I've been giving a second listening to here of late."
4,Call Me crazy...,"..but this is a great album! I have had this CD for many years and remember being a child dancing around to this and their older sigles (on LP, 45 and 12""). I still enjoy the production quality and over all great sound. I think a good addition to this would be to get their greatest hits (Definitley ABC). The remix of Be Near Me is worth the purchase alone. As my partner said upon playing me the greatest hits, ""I forgot they did all these fun songs""."
3,Kitsch > Taste,"Unlike previous releases, most notably The Lexicon of Love, How to be a Zillionaire lacks the lyrical depth and insight sufficient to offset the often overwhelming kitsch. Ultimately, this album comes off as uninspired and cheesy.The song, A to Z, is one of the most obnoxious and embarrassing songs ever released by an otherwise accomplished musical group. But to be fair, the song, How to be a Millionaire, may be one of the catchiest and entertaining."
4,Ahhhh...back to the totally awesome 80s!,"It was so nice to be taken back to those fun and exciting high school times! My too-cool-for-you preteen son even liked ""Be Near Me""! A definite must-have for any 80s fan as well as those who want music really representative of the 80s pop/new wave scene."
4,Decent Shredder,"I would buy this shredder again; never had any problems with it.But I do not think it is not wise to overload it. Each time I place9 pages at one time, it places too much pressure to it. Therefore,this is an excellent ""home"" shredder if you put 4 pages or less at a time."
4,DS-1 Shredder,Fellows DS-1 works very well. It is messy though. The wire mesh bin allows particles of paper to litter the area where the unit is used. Read operators manual and DO run the unit in reverse as that keeps the cutting head clear or accumulated shredded paper. We're very pleased with the performance.
3,great shredder,This is a great product. What an improvement over my old shredder. Wish I had bought it sooner. A great addition to my home office.
4,Fellowes DS-1 shredder,"This is a great shredder and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a home shredder. This thing will shred all those credit card mailers and all the other junk mail you get that you feel needs to be shredded. Although a bit large for the home office, it operates with ease and not a lot of thought. The wasite recepticle removes easy and the safety features work well. I tried to tire this machine out but it has not stopped preforming after continued usage. This is worth the money."
1,Shredded 30 pieces of paper and then died,I shredded 30 pieces of paper and then dumped the waste basket and that was it. It will not even turn on. Going back to amazon for a refund.
3,Good value for the money,"Put this baby in the kitchen (which is where we usually open the mail) and it works well. Pros: Sleek looking design, ample basket & handles 8.5 x 11 sheets without folding. Black and silver is a nice look. Cons: Noisy. It's a shame it's not quieter because otherwise, it would get five stars. Looked at alot of shredders and for the money, it's a good deal."
2,Bad sensor,"I bought the shredder from Amazon and used it for one day. The next day after shredding 3 pages it stopped. Never could get it to work again, like it was jammed. The blades were clear, the light was on and I could go in reverse only. I called Fellowes and they said it was a common problem with the plastic sensor in the middle of the slot on top. They said call Amazon and if they didn't replace to call them back and they would. I am boxing it up to send back to Amazon for a replacement. I did like it though while it was working and hope it was only a fluke.(Updated 2/8/08)Replacement shredder arrived. Worked long enough to shread 5 pieces of paper before it died again. Reverse only. Stay away from this product. Apparently something wrong with sensor as others have posted. I am going to look for non Fellowes product as this surely didn't go through product testing. Amazon however provided great customer service so far with easy returns. Not allowed to change my original rating to a 1."
1,Looks Pretty but only Ok Shredder,"I have a Fellowes DS-1 that I bought from Amazon. I was cleaning it out and a part fell out of the cutter head. I wrote to Fellowes for support. They said the unit has a 5 year warranty on the cutter head, but since the part appears to be a ""stripper"" that it's not covered.I bought a Fellowes product because I thought they were be bulletproof and stand by their product. I didn't expect metal pieces to fall out of the cutting head and have Fellows say that since I've had the shredder for more than the basic one year warranty, they won't cover it. I've had the unit for 4 years, almost to the day, and now pieces of metal start falling out of the cutter, and Fellowes says that's not covered by the 5 year cutter warranty. Very Strange. I'd spend the $100 on a better product next time. I evidently paid for pretty, and not for rugged."
1,Drive Gear Failed and no repair parts or service available,"My kids bought this for me to use for home shredding bills, receipts, and credit cards. I had this shredder for a little over two years when it started to fail. The motor would run but the blades wouldn't turn. I contacted the manufacturer, Fellowes. The helped diagnose the problem but the only replacement parts they had available is the metal basket. Seriously.Of course, before I threw it out, I took it apart to see exactly what had gone wrong. Stripped gears. Some metal gears looked fine, but I was surprised to see that the main drive gears were plastic. They had completely stripped, so the motor was no longer driving the blades. If this is a part of normal wear, they should have replacement parts. Not very happy that I had to throw away a $150 shredder because of a few dollars in plastic gears.Sorry Fellowes but that is not green and not customer friendly. I just ordered an Aurora shredder as a replacement."
4,5 minute shut off can be annoying,"This is a great product with a lightweight easy to handle basket, however I didn't realize it had a five minute use period, unlike my old portable over the waste basket model which could shred documents indefinitely. If you have large amounts of shredding to do, you will have to do it in five minute segments. Recently, looking at cross shredders at the office supply store I noted that they all have shut off times, some as little as two minutes."
3,Love the design,"Worked great for a basket and a half...then it stopped. I had emptied the first basket, oiled the blades per owners manual and waited about an hour. Then I was half way into the second basket and it stopped. Seems the circuit board fried. Reoiled the blades and waited 2 days but it still dead. Sent back for refund via Amazon and ordered the Fellowes 77Cs and it is working like a champ. If that burns up I'll try the 450/460, then a different brand after that. Am a happy boy for now..I love the mesh basket design of the DS-1. Easy to remove and empty. Stable, eats the paper easily and quickly. Just wish I hadn't gotten a lemon."
3,Power shredder,"I would recommend this shredder for personal use or a small office. It will not work continuously for long periods of time so follow the directions of length of use at one time. Also, when you take the basket out, it does require a bit of clean up. So we find we are regularly cleaning the area around the shredder."
1,unreliable,My 2nd one just broke after only one day of use. The 1st did the same thing. The reverse works but the unit stops taking paper in the throat. In both instances I shredded about 50 sheets of paper and 2-3 credit cards. I never overloaded the unit feeding no more than 4 sheets at one time. The unit is not overheated because the indicator is not on. There is something inferior about this product. Avoid it.
3,shredder,"I bought this shredder partially due to the name brand. Overall it performed well. However, there are two minor issues that need to be noted:1. The can must be situated perfectly under the shredder mechanism or the unit will not work. It can be quite frustrating getting the can to fit exactly right.2. For no apparent reason the shredder will not work even when the can is situated perfectely. Generally, I have to let it ""sit"" and then it will start working again.However, I have not had any major issues that would cause me to state that I would never buy this particular type again."
1,"already broken, was as loud as a vacuum cleaner","This machine was too loud to use in a medical office. The noise wasn't a problem for long, however, as the shredder broke after less than a month. I am now waiting for >2 weeks for a replacement."
3,Not worth the price.,"I researched many consumer recommended websites & this shredder stood out amongst home/home office shredders. It claims that it can shred 11 sheets per pass, but my shredder almost stopped with 9 sheets & I didn't want to push it by trying 10 since I needed to reverse it to get the paper out. Also, the shredder is REALLY REALLY loud! It is very irritating. The nice things about this shredder is the ease with which you can get rid of the confetti trash. Also, as for shredding, it does a very good job. Overall, if you can spend a little less (most other decent shredders cost $60-$70), I would recommend you do that."
1,Pass on it,"This shredder lasted all of 10 minutes of continued use. After it stopped working, I let it sit over night thinking it was the thermal sensor. It wouldn't start the next morning. Returned it for a full refund."
2,broke down after 1 year,"This product was working well but just broke down after a year of not so heavy use. Similar to some of the complaints I read in the reviews for this product, the reverse mode continues to work but not the forward shredding."
3,bug's,"work 4 the first day, then safety light started flashing ,then stop working had to turn off the safe switch...it work now y dont know.the switch might still b off.who knowthis my second one so i know it work well that y i get another one but this new mode or upgrade?first one had for 5+ year's over stuff it n pop it out of track"
3,Great While It Lasts,"This product performs well while it works. I purchased my first one in 2007 by Feb 2008 it died. Same issue as others it works in reverse, but the gears quit. No warning it just bombs out. First time excellent customer service sent me a replacement. I didn't have to send the old back I raved about the quick response. Fast forward just over a year later and the same thing happens call customer service and it's no longer under warranty I'm out. Not a cheap date to only last a year. I'm seriously considering another brand this time around. We run our business out of our home and NEED to have a reliable shredder that will work for that and our own personal shredding needs. Perhaps if we could just get companies to stop sending so much junk mail our shredders would last longer.... perhaps that is the conspiracy. Overall not as impressed as I would be had it lasted over a year and a half with either the first or second one."
4,Good Shredder for the money,"This is more stylish than most. Not sure how powerful it is, because it does not seem to be as strong as our last one that bit the dust. Overall I am pleased with the purchase, value, & design."
4,Worth the cost,All of the previous reviews were helpful.The comfort of knowing when I throw out shredded documents they will not be rumaged through is peace of mind.I kept my old shredder to use on paper that does not have any name or numbers on them to lessen the workload.A 13 gallon trashbag collects scraps.I owned it for 2 months and have no complaints.
2,16 Months to Failure,"I purchased this shredder in Jan 2008 and ran it under very light conditions for 16 months. Mostly, it was used to shred bills, paystubs, and the occasional credit card entreaty.Recently, I was shredding a four sheet document when it started to clang and stopped working. Right now, the feeder no longer pushes the paper forward so the shredder no longer functions. Furthermore, it makes an awful racket every time the shredder turns on. Basically, the thing is toast. Extensive oiling has made no difference.Before the shredder failed, I had a few problems. It was easy to overfill the bin, so when you went to remove it, paper shreds went flying everywhere. But overall, it was a good machine -- til it failed."
1,Fellowes DS-1 Cross Cut Shredder,"After only 14 months and less than 1000 sheets of paper shredded, my shredder died. There appears to be a basic design fault with Fellowes shredders of this type where the paper trigger breaks and the whole shredder is useless. Perhaps their business model is to get you to buy another shredder every year plus to replace the broken one, but with a cost of over 12 cents per page shredded you have to ask yourself if another company isn't a better buy."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this shredder for my mom and it died before 6 months was up. Spoke with the manufacturer and after answering a few questions and testing the shredder over the phone to determine if it was fixable, they readily agreed to send a new one and were very easy to deal with. Received the new one promptly and it hasn't been 2 months and the new one is now not working. Other Fellowes shredders have worked great that I have purchased, but steer very clear of this one. This shredder even looks cheap when you get it."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this shredder from Amazon a year and two months ago. It just stopped working because the automatic sensor stopped sensing the paper (although everything else works). The warranty only extends for one year. I called Fellowes and they shrugged their shoulders and said, ""I guess the sensor was faulty"". They didn't bother to replace it or fix it and said I needed to get a new one. I am definitely staying away from this machine maybe even the entire Fellows product line since their customer service lacks tact."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"We have had three other shredders before this one----some less expensive and some more expensive. This, by far, is the best one we have had. I do not regret this purchase at all. It does the job and does it very well. I also like not having to remove the top portion to empty the paper. The basket is much easier to handle. Love it!!"
1,When it works it works. when it don't expect NO Warranty,"the product received light use for 2 years and died. The blades would run in reverse, but would not run forward to shred. Contacted Fellows Support to learn that the 5 year warranty ""on the blades"" did not cover our problem which fell under the 1 year ""all other parts"" warranty.Same problem as others. The electronics Fail. not the blades."
2,impractical,"if you cannot tell from the image, this shredder is huge. certainly was too big for my space and will not fit below any desk or even next to one without being seen. didnt try the product because i wanted to return it, but just cosmetically be aware that this is probably best for an office, not home."
3,Great until its not,"This shredder worked wonderfully - until it suddenly stopped working. I tried changing the outlet, talking nice, but nothing seemed to work. It lasted just over a year, it was never used for a heavy duty job or even used very often."
1,Didn't Work,The shredder arrived and it didn't work at all and we had to send it back. We went to a local office supply company and bought another brand and it worked just fine.
4,Great - so far,"Out of the box it works great. I like the upright design. The pull out basket is nice, but it does leave a small mess...but nothing unexpected. It looks good, according to my Wife. I'll update this in a year and document it's performance. It's a home-use shredder, 3-4 times a week less than 3 minutes each use."
2,Doesn't Cut It.,"The original ""Grease"" with Olivia-Newton John and John Travolta had some of the best songs in movie-musicals and most memorable characters, not to mention a successful soundtrack, but they slipped up on the second set of songs, though there are a few stand out tracks.Michelle Pfieffer has a great voice, putting it to work on what are easily the best songs on the CD ""Cool Rider"" and ""Love Will Turn Back The Hands Of Time."" Other memorable tracks are ""Reproduction"" and ""Girl for All Seasons."" The other songs were boring, corny or cleshaed. If for nothing else, buy the soundtrack or movie for ""Cool Rider."" Or you could just pick up the original. You're getting more for your money, anyways. ( C- )"
4,i know i'm not alone,i know there are other people like me out there who like the music from 2 better than from the original.
2,Grease 2,"It is not the same as the original Grease. They tried too hard and it doesn't have the magic. It was nice to see Michele Pfeiffer singing, but otherwise avoid this movie unless you are really, really hardcore Grease fan."
5,Ignore anne she has no clue,"This movie was 10 times better than the first, the cast was even better and the music was out of this world. It remains one of my all time fave soundtracks. The only problem I can say is all the songs in the movie are not on the soundtrack. But other than that movie and music is killer. Plus Michelle is so hot!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Grease 2 soundtrack,"It is a good CD. It is almost what I expected. The one thing that would have made it better, would be if they inserted the lines from the movie that were inserted in the songs during the movie."
4,Je t'en pris fillette,"Even in the 1960's and 70's Antoine was little known outside France, but there he had major impact with 'Les Elucubrations' that perhaps have not travelled the distance. Other tracks, like the disturbingly simple 'Petite fille ne crois pas' stand alongside Donovan and Dylan by being wholly unpretentious - a statement - like 'why do you treat me like you do' and 'its' all over now', and something to be learned from. Some would say a copy of both Donovan and Dylan, though Antoine offered something special that neither could. But what was it? Listen."
4,This was a great ABC Afterschool Special in 1981,"I've been looking for this book for the longest time, but by the original title ""Hanging out with CiCi""...I remember when this book was made into an ABC Afterschool Special in 1981(which might be why the previous reviewer thought it to be a bit outdated) and I've been on the lookout for it ever since. This book strikes a chord with most every teenage, because who hasn't felt at one time or another that their parents just can't relate to them? This book helps to give another perspective and show that yes, our parents once were kids themselves who lived, loved and got in trouble just like we did. It's a must read for any teenager..."
4,Chinese comedy/drama that looks at modernizing with reproach,"Ermo, a Chinese peasant, is wanting to outdo her rival neighbor, so she establishes the goal to have the biggest TV in her village. Always funny and thoughtful, ""Ermo"" makes us look at societies and how they influence other ones."
2,Not wha t I expected,"I was hoping to watch an in depth documentary style program about this subject, but instead got an amateur, public access speech. To be fair, there were a few interesting parts(the NASA photos), but for the most part it was boring and difficult to watch."
2,I hate Algebra and I hate this book!,"I'm right on the verge of graduating and the only thing standing between me and my degree is this stupid College Algebra class, filled with useless information that I'm quite certain I'll never use again! Ok now that I've vented about that, I must say that I cannot understand why my college switched from Blitzer's College Algebra 2nd Edition to this text. As you may have guessed this isn't my first attempt at passing this *#$% class. A few semesters ago when I took it we used Blitzer's book, and while it was still Algebra and fairly loathesome, at least it was somewhat understandable! This book is clearly written for students who are good at advanced math and plan to go on to higher math. (Talk of Calculus in the pre-chapter! God help me!) Ok, so what if you don't plan on doing that? What if you are just taking this class because your state government says you have to or you can't graduate? I wish someone would write a Collge Algebra text for the rest of us!!!"
1,Beware - this DVD is a copy of Reflections....,"Be careful of this DVD - it's a copy, October 24, 2005Reviewer: Kay VanCleave ""Dr. Kay"" (Houston) - See all my reviewsReflections was a TV special, I think. The DVD ""Dusty"" and ""Her Very Best"" are copies of Reflections. I bought all 3 and told Amazon to see about these as these were frauds, direct copies.Buy Reflections and the Albert Hall concert, and leave the rest of them alone, unless you want 3 copies of the same thing.Dusty is fabulous as always but this DVD is not."
3,Beneath the golden mask,"Brier pumps out a lot of entertainment, but he is what my brother in law termed a ""soft boiled egghead"". His reliance on the conventional pseudochronology of New Kingdom Egypt gets him into trouble, but no moreso than other writers.The Amarna period is perhaps the most confusing of the New Kingdom, and even the existence and identities of various pharaohs is disputed. While Tut was probably not murdered, it wouldn't be any great surprise if it could be conclusively shown that he was, given the upheavals going on. Brier fails to prove it, and in fact he fails more often than succeeds in this book.This is worthwhile as long as it's taken with a grain of natron.See also ""The Lost Tomb: This Is His Incredible Story of Kv5 and Its Excavation"" by Kent R. Weeks, ""Oedipus and Akhenaten"" by Immanuel Velikovsky, David Rohl's ""Pharaohs and Kings"", and Peter James' ""Centuries of Darkness""."
3,Pointless as whodunit,"The book is well written and full of very valuable information about Ancient Egypt, which makes it worth reading. Unfortunately, however, the author tries so hard to make a 14th century BC monarch digestible to modern American readers, that he does stupid things like comparing Akhenaton's Amarna project to Woodstock in the 60s, or Akhenaton himself to a hippie guy, or turning Tutankhamen's death into a whodunit. There may have been no murder at all, the young pharaoh probably just fell from his car and hit his head; but even if he was really murdered by his vizier Aye, what is so bombastic about it? There's certainly nothing new about this version. Even in ""The Egyptian"", that old and unsurpassed novel by Mika Waltari, that's precisely what happens. There isn't even another plausible suspect beside Aye, who succeeded Tutankhamen as king of Egypt."
2,Murder 101,"The Murder of Tutankhamen was quite informative and obvious that the author did a tremendous amount of research for the book. However, the final analysis is still nothing more than conjecture on the part of the author regarding the possibility of murder. And the hypothesis that Tut could have lingered for several months after the injury before succumbing to death seems to be a real stretch.The author cast far and abroad for any clues possible to argue the case, but too many issues remain conflicatory for me to bring back a guilty verdict based on this book. Its a good read, but leaves the reader with a sense of doubt and mistrust of the presentation."
2,A fast readable crimestory with a little scientific value.,The overwhelming evidence that the author provides makes his book less believable. And therefor I found the scientific side of the book very disappointing. The book however is written in an easily readable way and as a crime story I enjoyed the book.
1,"Sensationalism, Not Scholarship","There is almost no doubt at all that Tutankhamen was murdered, and certainly the aged ""Divine Father"" Ay would seem to have had the most to gain from the young king's demise--but is it really necessary to write an ugly ""true-crime"" sort of book on the tragic end of the Amarna Period? Nothing new is to be found here, and whatever is of any value is better presented in the (at least) equally readable but infinitely more scholarly and sober works of Aldred, Desroches-Noblecourt, and Reeves. Mistransliteration of proper names (most notoriously, ""Smenkhare,"" an error that sets this reviewer's teeth on edge!)is always a warning flag in Egyptology that the work in question is not to be taken seriously, and this book is a classic of that kind."
5,A great book for anyone interested in Egypt or mysteries,This was one of the most detailed and well researched books I have ever read about the young king Tutankhamen. A careful look at the circumstances surrounding the untimely death of the world's most famous pharoah. A must read for anyone interested in Egypt of murder mysteries.
3,Interesting but not convincing...,"I enjoyed reading this book, but Brier didn't convince me of Aye's guilt. One thing that bothered me was that if Aye was such a wily character why would he send someone to bop Tut on the back of the head? Wouldn't he have chosen a quicker, more precise means of murder? If you believe Brier, the poor boy lingered for two months. Also, Brier depicts Ankhesenamen as being the same age as Tut. Several other sources make her a few years older, having previously born a child to her husband/father Ahkenaten. That discrepancy bothered me. Still, it was an interesting read and a good springboard for further reading re: Tutankhamen et al."
1,Fiction,"After the latest scholarly evaluation and investigation on the likely cause of death of Tutankhamen this book is a joke. More like fiction than history. Read it if you must, however there are far better books written by informed an eminent professional Egyptologists."
5,A Great And Informative As Well As Intriguing Work.,"""The Murder Of Tutankhamen"" is a very well-written book that never bores you and keeps you reading. Brier presents not only the facts and evidence about Tut's murder, but also gives an interesting lesson on Egypt's history and he makes clear how the factors that killed Tut came to be. This is a book that is incredibly packed with information, fatcs, and evidence. It feels more like an exotic detective novel. I was totally thrilled! Never has a book based on fact interested me so much. Books like these should be read in schools and studied by all interested in great, epic history. Brier is a fantastic investigator who puts together a puzzle full of betrayal, intrigue, romance, murder and conspiracy. I was also surprised to find out thing I never imagined, like the murder of the Haitit prince. ""The Murder Of Tutankhamen"" is a lush, informative work that deserves wonderous praise. I highly recommend it."
5,An interesting book that is more than it's title implies,"Egyptologist Bob Briers has that rare ability to convey his enthusiasm for a subject to his readers without going over their heards or talking down to them. ""The Murder of Tutankhamen"" deals not only with the possible incident of the title but provides a background in Egyptian history, culture and religion. At times it might seem that he is leaving his main subject when he goes off into those areas but it becomes apparent that the background is needed to present why he feels Egypt's most well known (not necessarily greatest) ruler was murdered. A very good case is presented using not just historical and cultural reasons but also recent medical evidence although in the end this may be one of history's possibilities which may never be provable. Either way you will have a good time with this book trying to decide."
4,Great reading with some interesting theories.,A very interesting theory on the death of Tutankhamun and overall a great summary of the time. I would however query the motive of the supposed murderer although the evidence would appear to point to that person. A good read and thought provoking story.
2,At the Heart of the Matter...,"It was a fun read (and inspires me to find out more about the Amarna Heresy), but essentially airy speculation.I see a logical problem at the heart of Brier's scenario: He envisions Aye, Tut's vizier, making arrangements to sneak an assassin into the royal bedchambers. Presumably, Aye says to the man, ""Here's your mace. The pharaoh's bedroom is that way. Hit him in the head -- but only one (1) time.""I suspect the phrase ""...beat his skull into bloody pulp"" would have been more likely to come up.Sounds more like a hunting accident or fall from a chariot, to me."
5,Really Interesting,"I think this is a really good book, especially for those that are not so knowledgable on ancient egypt. It describes cerimonys, rituals, and different beliefs. It also explains every-day egyptian life in an interesting way. With the thrill of a novel, but so much information!! I learned tons of facts that I didn't know before! Even if some people say there wasn't enough evidence to prove foul play, I thought it was good!I would recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good book!!"
3,"Mediocre, not always pleasantly so.","To be honest with you, I don't know where to stand on this book. While I find the conclusion that Ay was the perpetrator more than a little presumptuous, I find Brier's reasoning for the most part sound and well put. I admire Brier because he is a romancist, and yet, there are times when he let's the romance carry both him and the book away, in the end venturing off of--if not losing entirely--the point. The plates for the most part are fine, though the one of the alabaster canopic stopper from KV55 is hopelessly and sadly blurred. In all honesty, I am disappointed that such an esteemed Egyptologist could not produce better work. The potential is there; the execution of it is not."
1,Avoid this Place,"Product that showed up was not the pictured item. False description, lead on to believe I was buying OEM product from Kensington and it's some knock off. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Does what it says,"Look, this will not stop a determined thief: A screwdriver under the edge of the adapter and a sharp blow will most likely shatter the glue bond. In my situation that is not going to happen, so this is perfect for my needs."
4,Good driving test prep,"I have a fear of driving that I'm gradually overcoming with practice practice practice. I'm almost ready for my DMV driving test, so I wanted to watch this DVD to help ease my anxiety about that. I found this DVD helpful for giving me a better understanding of what to expect and to help me visualize what will happen during the test. The tips are presented in a way that's easy to understand and remember and I'd recommend the video."
5,Guide for seniors and younger,"Information is all very clearly presented. Shows specifically what a good driver needs to be doing. Contains driving safety facts that all drivers must pay attention to. Even if you are not preparing for a road test in the immediate future, the tips you'll gain will make you a better driver."
1,THIS IS NOT THE KORTY FILM,"This is not the film from 1967 by John Korty, it is a cheesey 1994 B-horror/comedy movie about someone who is ""Half Jester and Half Demon!"" So beware if you think (like I did) that you made a lucky discovery of this film, because you didn't! Order at your own risk!"
2,NOT VERY FUNNY,"I searched and searched and searched and finally found this DVD. What a huge disappointment. I didn't laugh not one time. It's not as though I was given ample time, this performance was only thirty minutes long in duration. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone."
4,The Truth is Out There,"This is crucial information to get out to everyone who eats! This DVD does a good job at waking us up to the ""Truth"" about the corruption amongst the FDA and the Agro-Chemical industry. It's a must see and a must pass on to everyone concerned about the health and well being of others and our planet. As the film suggests, we as individuals have the power to stop this. INSIST ON ANSWERS from your local grocery, from your local farmers, from your local governments. The film's presenters seem truthworthy and articulate very clearly the loss of FDA accountability for our food safety, the lack of research about GMO's and the dismissal of our right to choose and know about what we put in our bodies. This is a low budget production, but it's rawness matches it's message."
1,Important Issue Badly Executed,I loved the book.... The topic is one of the most important on this planet today. Smith owes it to all of us to withdraw this lame excuse for a DVD and start all over again.NOW!!!!
1,many statements not back ups,"This is a waste of time. First, music in the video made my ears hurt. Then, several people just talk about how modified food is bad, they state many different 'facts' but no back up. I cannot believe I've wasted $1 on the rental."
3,seedy video,"This video started out slow with the type of rants you might find on you tube, and later became more factual. There were definitely some interesting facts, but only some were in the video. There were more interesting facts in the extras, but I didn't watch many of those yet as I was sort of burned out on the bologna that should have been edited out. I was hoping this would be a video I could share with people to help them become aware of whats going on in our food industry/government right now, but I wouldn't want to FFWD through all the opinions and rants. It was worth watching and if you consider the cost of going to the theater these days Like I did to see FOOD INC. ( which I also bought, great movie) it was worth the cost."
