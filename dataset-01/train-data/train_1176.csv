3,"Good, but misses out...","I have a working knowledge of Comics, and looked for McCloud's book to not only tell me about comic theory, but also to apply it to specific works. McCloud is good on the theory, but neglects to tell me much about WHAT comics are out there that are engrossing and illustrate his points. I didn't walk away from this book, as I had hoped, thinking ""Wow! I can't wait to buy this and this and this comic!,"" and that's a shame. Scott McCloud obviously cares deeply about comics and is knowledgeable; but why does he completely neglect to talk about plot? Or characterization? Or the typical lengh or panel count by page of a comic?In short, this is a decent, readable book by an extremely knowledgeable souce, but it has many holes."
5,Truly excellent book on storytelling,"I love this book. Not only does it explain visual storytelling, and how we understand stories and comics, but also illustrates perfectly how you go about implementing the principle, ""Show, don't tell"", so vital to creating compelling stories. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in telling stories, of any kind."
5,The art and science of comics revealed,"Scott McCloud has done a wonderful job of presenting the rather nebulous world of sequential art (commonly called comics) to the layman and comic fan alike. Formatting the book as a comic book was inspired. It definitely helped to make the concepts he presented in the book clearer.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in that learning comics are more than just ""funny pictures."""
5,Unbelievably great!,This is an amazing book and one that is essential to anyone interested in communicating ideas visually. Would love to hear McCloud's take on the Web
2,Just for college digital photography class.,My teacher pushed all the students in the class to buy this book. I wasn't looking for a comic designing book. Even though designing comics for my story was always for my considered concept on how to put together my possible future book/comic.
5,Now I Get It!,"This book has really helped me to understand coomics like never before. I am an artist and I am considering creating and publishing my own comic book, with the help of this book, it will be a whole lot easier to do so. Because, I now understand not just the mechanics of creating a comic book, but I understand the art of comics as well.Thank you."
5,Incredible,"This comic transcends the medium. He gets a little unwindy in the final two chapters, but then again if you had spent 2 years writing the definitive story on comic evolution you probably would be pretty tired too! Still this book can be picked up by anyone, and I dare you to say you are not completely engrossed by this great story of comic books."
5,Read this book! Read this book!,Not just for comic book fans. Read this book and you will never look at art the same way. I give this book as a gift all the time. I highly recommend it.
5,"The Bible of the comic art form, period.","I know my one-line summary might seem a little grandiose,but this truly is *THE* best book I've ever read on comics. It's one of the few texts out there willing to regard the comic strip as an art form (and make no mistake, it *is* art; author Scott McCloud proves that beautifully) and give an indepth analysis of the very fiber of comics, with everything covered from Japanese ""masking"" techniques to the nonsensical but strangely fluid senses of comic timing. Comics.. or shall I say ""sequential art.."" garner a whole new level of respect and praise through McCloud's efforts."
2,annoying and overrated...,"i'm not quite sure why this book is so loved. artists and writers do work, they don't need a primer on comics (especially this one). fans don't need this because its better to spend your money on great comics works rather than this. some historical tidbits or stuff about the mechanics of comics are slightly interesting, but overall i was very disappointed with this work."
2,What is everybody talking about?,"I don't know what everyone is talking about, but this book was an absolutely dull nightmare of a read. I think I would rather read something written by Todd McFarlane than to read this garbage. I have been reading comics for over 20 years and this is one of the most hyped books I had not read, so I picked it up expecting a revelation and I could barely get through the inane drudgery that Scott McCloud puts you through. Sorry, I don't need an explanation of panels and motion. I think I learned that when I was 9 and read my first issue of The Avengers. What exactly is so fascinating about this book? Someone please tell me!"
5,Brilliant book - McCloud is about much more than comics,"McCloud - to my mind - stands with Edward Tufte as an illuminator of visual information - and along the way, in reading all three of McCloud's books, I got a bit of art history, cinema history, graphic design - the connections between them - and more than enough to make me want to know more about all of McCloud's connected territories."
5,"The sequential art, the multimedia art, the vocabulary you don't know you use","This book is about so much more than comics. It's packed with insight about the psychology of perception, the evolution of pictoral and verbal communications, and all kinds of goodies.The one that got me was the concept of filling in what happens ""in the gutter."" That's the space between frames where the imagination works. This is a powerful way to understand some of what takes place in group sequential communication too. It applies to the sense or nonsense people make of forum discussions sometimes, for example. That non-existant content in the ""gutter"" between posts can grab people by the emotions.In addition, it is beautifully drawn and includes lots of visual vocabulary you didn't know you needed. Wonderful gift for anyone interested in communication, design or illustration, let alone in comics!"
2,review,used this book for an art class. used it sparingly. i think i resold it. not related to my nutrition major.
3,It's McCloud...,"I know this is tantamount to HERESY in the world of comic book lovers, but McCloud's a bit... well... NUTS. His books are very interesting, sometimes though-provoking reads, but he's not writing for academes. A good, strong, critical look tells me that this man is writing for those who already agree but aren't well enough trained in argumentation to make their point. It's about 30% fluff, which is fine, but McCloud is an extremist, and as such, know what to expect. He is a big voice, and he's good at what he does, but to create a piece that truely could have an impact on any serious academic, he needs to be more critical and impartial. His bias is overwhelmingly powerful. Don't get me wrong--I agree with the man whole heartedly! But preachin to the choir just gets you a bored choir. Well, maybe not for those less concerned about convincing someone outside the industry."
2,perhaps the most repetitive book ever,"I was required to read this book for a college art class, and hated it. I'm not a comic book fan, but I also don't detest them either. I found the book to be mildly interesting, but just way too reptitive. The author goes on and on about the same things for way too long, practically beating the subjects to death. The author tries to get the reader to take things in the book so seriously, it seems a little ridiculous."
4,And now I do (a little better),"This is a wonderful companion to Making Comics by the same author, Scott McCloud. Love the history of comics that's included in this work or art."
1,Disgusted,This book was by far the worst book i have ever read. It did not keep my interest at all and I could not see how anyone can relate to it. The book itself was BORING. Please do not make any more copies of the book.
1,Profoundly disappointed,"From the reviews of others and following the author's induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame, I was quite amazed at the content. I recognize that my taste differs from many. I can't imagine the authentic greats of the game appreciating this representation of the ""real"" PGA world. There was so much in terms of base, no value content in ""Dead Solid Perfect"" that what was good about the book was buried. I muscled through over half of the book and then realized that it was, for me, a cup of something other than tea."
4,One Solid Drive Down the Fairway,"Dan Jenkins tees it up and drives it straight down the fairway in this oftentimes very dark comedy concerning the professional golf tour.The 1974 novel centers on Kenny Lee Puckett, who is a swinger in many ways, from the links to the 19th hole. Puckett plays the tour like a rock star, but is propelled into the spotlight of the national stage when he makes a remarkable run for a major title.The majority of the characters are chasing life as much as they are pursuing a paycheck on tour, but their flaws is what makes this sports novel a tap-in for eagle on the last hole."
1,Dan Jenkins' & relationships,A little about golf and 'inside the PGA tour'... Plenty of gratuitous language 'n ornery Texans... Mostly about Dan Jenkins' views on relationships with women... Forced a couple laughs.
5,Great Speakers!,"I installed these in the rear of my 2003 Nissan Maxima connected to an Alpine CDA-9857 Head Unit. For a 2 way 6.5"" set of speakers, these sound great! It would still be nice to have a set of subs to add a nice crisp sounding low bass but I was nonetheless impressed with the sound this set produced with the limitations of a 2 way system. I highly recommend these."
2,golf workout,this was not as good as i thought it would be. maybe i should have looked for a workout for golf as a senior
5,A great book.,"I thought this was an amazing book. Now, I don't say that just because I love anything that has to do with Disney, but I truly think that it is very helpful. I own the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 editions, and after reading them I have come to one conclusion, they aren't the best guide if this is your first time going to Walt Disney World. The book is published by Disney Enerprises, so it says everything in the park is amazing. If it is you first time, I would suggest a book that is not published by Disney, such as Frommers or the Unofficial Guide, because they rate the rides and attractions. Ohter than that, this book is the one for you. It can tell you some of the inside facts that ones that are not published by Disney can't. This guide is fully illistrated, so children can enjoy it also. That is my book review, I hope I didn't bore you to death."
1,Birnbaum Sells Out to the Disney Machine,"Many years ago (1997) I went to Disney World with my wife and were very satisfied with the Birnbaum Guide.This year (2004) we plan to visit Disney with our 3 year old daughter, and recently picked up the 2004 Birnbaum's Guide. After reading only a few paragraphs and noticing a much rosier picture of Disney than what we would expect in an ""objective"" guide, we looked in the front and found that Birnbaum had SOLD OUT! The publisher of this guide is now Disney Editions!I will be returning the Guide to the bookstore tomorrow, and I will buy a Guide from one of Birnbam/Disney's competitors."
3,"Lots of promise, but a ways to go","I saw these guys live, and I must say that their live show is GREAT, which makes this EP something of a letdown. This EP doesn't seem to capture the frenetic energy and rich sound of their live show. The songs here are enjoyable but ultimately forgettable, and there's nothing being done here that a dozen other New York indie bands aren't doing better. Also, it's always a bad sign when the strongest material on your record is a cover of someone else's song (Glamorous Life).That being said, I still HIGHLY recommend their live show if they're ever in your town, and I still think these guys can break out of the pack of indie dance-rock sound alikes and find big success if they can find a way to harness the sound and energy of their live show and put it on a CD."
1,Disappionted,"What is there to review?? I can't listen to the tracks!!!I'm looking for a particular song by this artist and no oneseems to know the name of the song!!! Why is it that I canlisten to the tracks of one cd, and not be able to do so onthe next? Why,Why,Why???? Im tired of buying cd's by thisartist hoping the song will be there!!!!"
2,Comic book-esque,"I was disappointed. I only read 50 pages or so before pitching the book, but in that short span it was revealed that not only was St Cyr the greatest Romeo that London had ever seen, and had hearing far exceeding normal humans, but he could control the flight of a pistol ball with exact precision. For everybody else, a round projectile wanders unpredictably, thats why we use rifled barrels and pointed projectiles now - but St Cyr is not subject to the laws of physics.As to personality, he was the type to ignore, twice, his faithful manservant who was trying to tell him something important. I have seen numerous comics with better plot development and more believable characters."
4,excellent mystery with complex characters,"I was glad to find a new historical mystery writer, and lovedlearning some more details about the period. The main charactersare multidimensional and the conclusion was not too predictable.I have already ordered the next book in the series."
4,Very good historical mystery & pageturner!,"I have become so choosy about the historical mysteries I read. The characterizations have to really draw me in and make me care. St. Cyr does not disappoint! I found myself picking it up at odd times of day to see what would happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed the time period and setting. I will continue reading this author. My favorite historical mystery/fiction authors are probably first, Candace Robb (OWEN ARCHER), Ellis Peters (BROTHER CADFAEL), Gary Jennings (AZTEC & JOURNEYER), and A+ to Lawhead for BYZANTIUM."
4,Someone for Everyone,"This book has such a varied cast of characters that, really, there IS someone for everyone. Okay Okay, no dentist, no veterinarian but just about everyone else is in ""What Angels Fear."".I found this book to be fast moving, interesting and entertaining. The character of Sebastian St. Cry is very appealing; his Bithil syndrome is fascinating. (I saw a girl with those yellow eyes selling ice cream in Kenner LA some years ago.) His love interest, Kat, is not so likable. She claims to love Sebastian oh so much and her past behavior points to this. However, in the present time of the story, she makes his dangerous situation more so by withholding information from him.I have to admit that I am not very knowledgeable about this period in British history. I see that one reviewer found this book ""preachy"" on the topic of politics. I really do not like preachy politics; perhaps had I more knowledge, I too would say that and knock off a star. But, for now, I'll stay with four stars."
2,What Angels Fear: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery,"The book had the color of the time, but involved too much ""chase anxiety"", too much sex for me, which made the plot too common and ""Hollywood"". I prefer a Victorian, or Regency tale from a famous, or infamous, detective's viewpoint. A detective of uncommon ability, Sherlock Holmes' adventures are more my taste."
3,Okay book in a great series.,"I am not sure how much I am going to like Sebestian in his new life role. We'll see. I wish the author would go ahead and reveal the mystery behind his mother. Hopefully that will come out in the next book, if not, I think I will give this series a reast."
4,Excellent Start to a Winning Regency Series,"C.S. Harris is a favourite discovery of late, What Angels Fear was intended as a quick beach read; but I soon found myself falling for the series. I have heard the hero, Sebastian St. Cyr referred to as a hybrid of Mr. Darcy and James Bond and this representation is accurate. Harris writes a gripping and graphic mystery and the first two of the series ( the rest are already checked out of the library ) were wonderfully-paced and chockfull of interesting tidbits from the Regency Era. The inclusion of politics and the seedy underworld of England at that time are well-rendered and I especially love her characterization of the foppish and boorish Prince Regent himself."
4,Very enjoyable historical mystery,"I don't read books to pick apart the anachronisms or grammar, unless it is frequent and glaring. I read for simple pleasure and I found this novel to meet that criteria. This was the first time I read this author and the series was recommended to me by some friends on another author's bulletin board. I'm happy to have had the recommendation and will definitely continue reading the St. Cyr. series. The action is good, the plot well written and most of the characters are intriguing. I especially liked Sebastian and his little side kick, Tom. I was a little surprised there was so much graphic detail about the murder scene (there are a few ICK moments). There is a limited amount of romance in this book, but I realize that romance is not the focal point of a mystery novel. Well worth the read!"
4,A good start ....,"""What Angels Fear"" is a very good first start to the St. Cyr series. I wouldn't characterize this book as a pure mystery but more of romantic suspence. Given that CS Harris also published romances under the name Candice Proctor, I wasn't surprised by the amount of time spent on the romance as well as the mystery. There are a few gory scenes in the book but there is also a romance that will continue to grow/change as series will grow/change.There are a few things about the main character that are a little too pat for my liking but the author's note at the end, answered some of these questions for me. I would suggest not reading and putting the book down often because some of the characters are forgettable but play a part in the story later on.A good start to a new series."
3,"Engrossing, over the top mystery/romance","I'm on a historical mystery kick and thought this was one. Wrong. It's a romance novel fashioned around a mystery. That being said, it's a wonderfully engrossing book, well written, and full of interesting details about the time. The more comic book-esque aspects bothered me at first but as I read more of the book I happily suspended my disbelief and simply enjoyed the book. I will be buying the other books in the series when I want a light and engrossing book to read (on the plane, on the train, on the beach)"
4,Good story,"I really like this book. The plot isn't as intense as I would like, but the first book in a series always has the job ofsetting up characters, so I'm not too worried. I am definitely going to be reading the rest of the series."
1,Kindle Users Beware,"Regarding the use of this book on Kindle - it USED to be speech enabled, allowing a Kindle user to play the book in your car so you could hear it while you drove (or any other place, if you wanted to give your eyes a rest). Now, all of a sudden, it's no longer speech enabled (text-to-speech). What gives? Did the publishers suddenly change their minds? Is the support for text-to-speech disappearing from our Kindles? I bought Kindle BECAUSE it had the text-to-speech ability, and now that seems to be getting more and more useless for the books I want to buy. Horrible."
2,Average historical murder mystery with quite a few inaccuracies,"I found much of the writing of this book to be stilted and dry. It was also obvious this was Ms. Harris' first book as it didn't flow very well. I also found the whole idea of a police force run like modern day British police to be a bit of a laugh. As another reviewer mentioned, the police didn't act like this in England for at least another 50 years. Believe me, I'm British, and grew up with stories of Robert Peel (the founder of the British Bobbies) and the like. Sebastian also needs to learn some new language as ""Bloody Hell"" was said at least 30 times during the book and, in many cases, in a way a true Englishman wouldn't say.Having said this though, I did give Ms. Harris' second book a try and it was much better. Flows more, more natural speech patterns and more interesting. I'll definitely buy her third book as it looks like a fun read."
4,Great!,"It had all the elements I love most-history, romance, mystery. I think it could have been a little shorter. The mystery was fairly easy to figure out but well written characters make up for that."
4,"Great book, can't wait to read the second installment","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters and story are complex, the story is exciting and the love story is believable. I liked the political undertones - the Whigs vs. Tories, the rich vs. poor. There are layers that you don't find in most paperback novels."
4,"Good album, but I miss the older stuff","I have been a fan of Guster for a number of years, since their release of Goldfly. I have to say that while this album is very good, it lacks the sound that gave Guster such appeal during their earlier era. Perhaps Guster has become too ""pop"" in an attempt to become more mainstream. There are great songs on this album, but I would love to hear it with the trademark bongo drums and the sort of soulful harmony of Goldfly and Parachute. Lost and Gone Forever seemed to be the threshold of the new sound and Keep It Together firmly places Guster in this new era . While I long for days past, I am looking very much forward to what direction they take next."
1,I wept,"I have been a long time fan of Guster and I wept when I listened to this so-called music. Good job boys, you cracked out of the clutish into the pop world. I hope they're proud of their turn into mediocrity and conformance. It only leaves me wondering whether it was the money, pressure from the label, or insanity that drove them to give up what seemed like a genuine love for the music and just bleed out this stuff."
1,Not their best,"After listening a few times, only a couple of the tunes stay with me. It truly does belong on the bargin rack."
2,Terrible,"Well, another solid band as crossed over and sold out. Whoever says this band is maturing hasn't listened to the other stuff. The peak was Goldfly and it's been all down hill from there. They have met the evil of over production. This album sounds like something a bunch of 18 year olds would make. The songwriting is pretty bad. The drummer (bongoer) writes like 4 songs on the album and they are all terrible. He's never written any songs for the other albums. Amsterdam being a perfect example of how bad they are. Save your money"
1,...,"Just like all trash, this belongs in a dumpster. Doesn't even deserve one star. The single...Amsterdam..that song makes me cringe. Atrocious. Brutal on the ears. Stay away."
3,Easy Listening,"It's a lot more polished than other albums; it's clear that Guster can afford it now. Overall, it's listenable, but maybe too listenable. The songs all blend together, and in the end, you're left with a nice feeling, but you don't really remember what you heard.And whatever happened to the other singer??""Come Downstairs and Say Hello"" is memorable (my favorite song on the album), but it's still not nearly as catchy as other great Guster songs (Demons, Two Points for Honesty, Happier, Fa Fa).Don't get me wrong, I like the album! I really like Guster... But it just seems like it's all production now. I'd say, check out ""Lost and Gone Forever"" or ""Goldfly."""
4,"Damn you for being so playable, Guster.","I ran into Guster when Pandora [the intuitive internet radio station] suggested them to go along with Neil Finn & Crowded House. I enjoyed them so much I sent away for 'Keep It Together'. Man, it is the absolute best driving music for early summer. Ryan Miller's voice is so perfectly clear and emotional without overdoing it. If you're a fan of great harmonies and simple, best-type-of-college-band rock, go grab it."
5,Keep it Together,They keep getting better and better. I have waited FOREVER for the new Guster album to come out. This album is great! Everyone needs to buy this cd....!
5,Join the Red Oyster Cult!!,"WOW... is the first thing I must say. K.I.T. really could be the best album Guster has put out, although Goldfly is pretty damn good. The new album is more mainstream acceptable, which I honestly don't mind because they kept some of their original sounds, like the bongos, and great vocal harmony. The album still has Guster written all over it, but unlike past albums mostly limited to the likings of college students, and a few high school crowds, this album could bring Guster into the spotlight. Red Oyster Cult is the best track I think, but Homecoming King is also a favorite. The other songs are all good, and this is an album that you can listen to and sing with in the car the whole way through... way to go guys, ur awesome!"
5,The Perfect CD,"Oh man! Let me begin by saying I went to the Boston free outdoor concert in Government Center. We're talking about downtown Boston! It rocked with 40,000+ people in attendance! I met them and shook their hands and had them sign my ducked tape wallet and a random piece of paper i found...and my cd and cd cover of course. Anyway I gave the CD a 5 since that is the max but it Deserves a 10. It's so good. You can't go wrong when it comes to Guster! Trust me! Considering you have no idea who I am. : )"
5,Sheesh...,"A few friends of mine recommended this band to me and I just can't get this CD out of my CD player. I could go and do a whole track by track analysis like everyone else, but that would be a waste of time for both of us.EVERY SONG IS GREAT!I urge you to get this CD."
5,Awesome Music!,"Well after a friend interducted me to guster a year or two back, i've been really excited about them. and so after going to 2 shows and listening to all of their cds, while waiting patienly like a kid on christmas for the new cd. and now that i've got it i think its so great i mean the lyrics and the musicianship it amazing even if Brian is on drum kit. but in my opinion this is one of their best albums."
4,Earthy College Rock,"On their fourth release Keep It Together, Boston trio Guster continues to refine their earthy college rock. They trade in the relatively mellow reflections of Lost and Gone Forever for medium-tempo sing-alongs buoyed by the lovely harmonies of Ryan Miller and Adam Gardner. The music is a group effort; lyrics are split between Miller and percussionist Brian Rosenworcel. Usually, the songs are a look inward (""Careful"") or backward (the MTV hit ""Amsterdam""). Yet they keep their nostalgia under control, unlike, for instance, John Mayer. Plus the tunes are catchy as all get out. ""Amsterdam"" is a hit because you're singing the chorus before the song is over (the `revenge is sweet' lyrics don't hurt, either). ""Homecoming King"" implores you to move past your glory days (""stay right where you are / you'll be half of who you were""). ""I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today"" is the sum of their philosophy."
5,Great CD,"This was my first Guster CD. I'd read a favorable review somewhere, plus heard ""Amsterdam"" a few times on the radio, so decided to give it a try. While I liked the sound of it right away, it took several listens for me to really appreciate just how terrific these guys, and this CD, are. And it continues to get better every time I play it. There isn't a bad track on here, and several (""Careful"" and ""Come Downstairs and Say Hello"" to name just two) are as good as songwriting gets these days. The melodies are catchy and infectious (I wake up at night with these songs in my head), their harmonies are gorgeous, the lyrics are literate, the instrumentation is tight, the production is superb. What else could you want? If those things appeal to you, I can't imagine you won't love this album. Me, I'm ordering their earlier stuff when I finish writing this review."
3,Disapointed,"Although I used to be a die-hard fan,I wasn't very satisfied with Guster's new CD, especially considering the amount of time they worked on it. I expected them to come up with something better than they did, and less of conforming to the styles of many pop/rock bands today."
3,No Screamers,"KIT is a very enjoyable and likable album. I am somewhat disappointed however because it isn't as good as LGF. The songs are more mellow, which is fine, but they are also less catchy. Do you know those songs that when you are at a concert and the band plays the first few notes of them, you get a huge rush and start screaming for joy? I think that's what's lacking on this disc. There aren't any that I would start screaming over at their concert. The songs are all pleasant, but they are not classic like the ones on LGF."
2,An old fan disappointed,"As excitedly played the cd in my car on the way home from the record store, I became increasingly impatient...looking for songs with a little bongo drum action. Finally, Backyard had it...but it was not that prevalent. Yes, after about 3-4 listens, the songs grow on you. But Guster's other cd's have never needed a couple listens to before they become catchy. It sounds too poppy, and i miss the crescendos, and especially the intensity of the bongos. An okay cd, but I hope at the concert I go to in a few weeks that they play a lot of old songs."
2,Disappointed,"I became a Guster fan a few years ago and I enjoy listening to each of their first three albums. I was anticipating the release of their fourth album for over a year and I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. I have listened to the CD about 15 times all the way through over the last month or so and I just can't help but wonder where this album went wrong. The songs are poppy and over-produced. The lyrics are nothing like what we have come to expect from this band. It seems to me that somebody got to these guys and convinced them that if they ever wanted to ""get big"" they would have to kill the bongos and ""dumb down"" their songs. I am still a Guster fan, but I am a disappointed Guster fan."
5,A top contender for Album of the year,"Why do people not like the sound of a drumset and electric instruments? The drums compliment the congas fantastically. I bought this CD after hearing ""Amsterdam"" on MTV2. The song was in my head for days and days. I bought the CD, after never even listening to Guster, and I am blown away.The instrumentation is completely stellar. This record will not come out of my player along with Give Up by the Postal Service; the two albums are the greatest that have come out yet this year (With Fountains of Wayne a distant third).Buy this record. It is unbearably pretty."
4,Another winner from Guster,"Many bands make the mistake of following up an album even THEY must know is near-perfect by trying to duplicate it. It becomes apparent when listening to Keep it Together that Guster made absolutely certain they weren't rehashing Lost and Gone Forever when they cut this great album. Having said that, when following up a near-perfect album, it is hard not to review one in light of the other.Keep it Together is not as immediately likeable as Lost and Gone simply because the songs aren't quite as hooky. This isn't good or bad, just descriptive. The songs are wonderful, slightly less poppy, and definitely more experimental for these guys. Jesus on the Radio features a raw banjo track, and Red Oyster Cult is the most unGusterlike song I've heard them record yet. That said, both tracks are amazing! If you liked Lost and Gone Forever but aren't looking to spend $15 on buying the same album twice, Keep it Together is a worthwhile purchase."
4,This is a great relaxed cd,"I thought this was a great cd. One morning I woke up and turned on the tv and saw guster playing a song called amsterdam off of their new cd Keep it together.After that I ran out and bought it. I love backyard and come down stairs and say hello is really great. I thought they could of made backyard a lil longer,not even words just music. The song jesus on the radio is a awesome song I love, the guitar in that song its really great it reminds me of a song by led zepplin but anyway I would defently recommened people to go out and get the cd I loved it!!!"
2,Silver pendant,"Nice fish pendant, but not what I wanted. Wanted for a necklace. Would be nice is it was smaller, more delicate."
1,It doesn't work,"I paid more for the postage than the product. I had to take it to a watch shop to get a battery in it, but it still didn't work. The watch shop said it was a mechanical fault and it happens in CHEAP watches."
4,Works well,"Easy to put together and works well. The copper does not stay copper for long, but look ok. The ceramic tile is good looking and stays good looking. Well made and not flimsy, I recommend it."
2,STRAIT UP -CUBAN GUANGUANCO,THIS IS A GREAT CD WITH SOME GOOD GUAGUANCO FROM CUBA THEY SHOULD HAD NAME THE CD EL GUAGUANCO DE CUBA BECAUSE IT SAYS LA RUMBA DE CUBA AND ALL THE SONGS ARE 100%CUBAN GUAGUANCO THE CUBAN RUMBA SOUNDS DIFERENT BUT IF YOU LIKE GUAGUANCO THIS IS THE A GOOD CD YOU CAN BUY
5,Awesome Study of the Women in the Bible!,"I absolutely LOVED this book. I used it over the summer as a personal study-devotional book, it was PERFECT!!!To get the most out of this book, grab your bible and read each individuals story right from scripture, your experience with the book will be greatly enhanced.I've given this book as a gift to a couple of women friends and have recommended it to many many more.A huge round of applause for Anne Spanger and this book!!"
3,Not woth it,"Not sharp at all (even though it says razor sharp), hilt was scratched in a few places , scabbard was very tight, and the guard was scratched. Pretty disappointed about it not being sharp; a butter knife seems to be sharper than this. The one good thing is how sturdy this is. I checked their website and other reviews are saying that it now comes dull, really wish i had seen this earlier. Good for someone who wants a practice sword I suppose, as this thing isn't going to be cutting much. They really need to change the description ""with a razor sharp edge""."
3,eh,The only reason i goth this sword is because everyone says it is so sturdy but when i got it the guard was loose (very disappointing) besides that its sturdy hopefully it will stay that way.
4,Great Product for Display,"Well what can i say, Its a very sturdy sword. Its not very sharp but it does have a very pointed tip. I like it."
3,LOUD and I think it works,"I put this in a smelly room to see if it works and the smell went away quickly so despite the previous bad reviews, I am keeping this. The Honeywell 1700 did nothing for more than an hour before I plugged in the Hunter 30714. It definitely cleans the air of smells although the Honeywell ones make more promises e.g. antibacterial. If the low price is due to discontinuation, then I am happy to pay less for something that does the job."
5,Removes Smell,"I was looking at different options before running into this deal.At $44 bucks I couldn't pass it up. We have had it about 3 months and so far so good.I actually really got to test it after my wife made some fish for dinner. I moved the unit to the kitchen and put it on high and didnt' turn on any other fans. It really removed the smell. By the end of dinner the kitchen smelled normal.I haven't replaced the filter yet but that is where I see the extra expense is going. For the price, I would get another one."
4,Great for a small bedroom or den,"Agree with the other reviewers, the filter replacement cost is high. In my case it will average about $10/mon.I didn't expect this small unit to clean the air in our entire bedroom, which is very large with cathedral ceilings. It does an excellent job filtering the air in the lower portion of the room, where we sleep or sit.Purchased the unit in April '07. The first time the Pre-Filter light indicated it needed to be changed, I washed the filter lightly in cool, sudsy water, let it air dry and reused it. It will cost $19.95 to replace it next time.The HEPAtech filter replacement light came on after 5-1/2 months of use. Replacement cost was $29.95 from Amazon.One other note, this air purifier must be placed on a shelf or table-top, not on the floor."
4,Great Air Purifier,"The Hunter Air Purifier works great but the filter is not as easy to clean as your are led to believe. When you try to vacuum the dust out, you also remove the fibers that collect the dust. Ours have been cleaned twice and now have to be replaced. You can find these at prices of $59-$19 each depending on where you shop. We've had our machines approximately 5 months."
3,Not sure if this thing work,"We just bought one of these. The noise is bearable. On Turbo it sound less than most air conditioner, so not bad. We've had the machine for a couple of days and we can't really tell if the machine work. We opened it up and checked how strong the suction and we don't or barely feel anything coming from under the fan. So, at this point I think we bought a very exensive fan. Not sure how these things are suppose to filter anything without any suction coming from the fan. I would look around if I have to do this over again."
4,A lof of Information,"Though I haven't had time to really read through this book, I have skimmed through it, and there seems to be much information, and many illustrations and examples. I cannot imagine that anyone interested in learning how to properly produce draping/wrinkles in their work wouldn't benefit from this book. It arrived on time and in good condition. I'd order again."
5,Who'd have thought this book existed?,"That's what my friend said when he saw this in my stack of newly acquired books. Indeed, that's what I thought when I picked it up as well!Sculpting realistic figures requires knowledge of every space that will need to be created. Hogaths book takes you through all the rhymes and reasons for those folds in the fabrics that artists will be required to create either in illustration or sculpture. While it is geared towards drawing, the information relates just as well to sculpture.Some may not be a fan of his illustration style (that is entirely subjective matter anyway) however you can not deny the enormous value of this highly essential work for any artist's bookshelf."
2,Not an ideal reference.,"I picked up this book from my college's library when I was researching how to clothe some nude figures I had drawn from life. But I was rather disappointed. The folds and wrinkles shown in this book are wildly exaggerated and often wrong. I also had a hard time feeling any 'weight' to the folds. Some of the concepts written about are good advice, but those are so skewed in the drawings that if anyone tried to actually follow them I'm fairly certain their art professors would laugh and promptly down grade the work. In all honesty I have no idea why my school even has this book. Every student I showed it to immediately recognized it's faults. You're better off googling pics of real people (or better yet- getting a live model), then trying to use this book."
2,"Could be used for reference, I guess","The teaching is totally confusing, with all the arrows pointing everywhere. It's better if you hang a piece of fabric up and study the pull and drag of gravity on the cloth. If you want to draw dramatic wrinkles and how to wing it then some of these could be used as inspiration. It's mostly inaccurate."
2,Not so good,"I have owned this book for years. . .not sure why I have kept it because every time I pull it out I am disappointed. The wrinkles are over exaggerated as are the figures themselves. Perhaps that is the point, but I don't get it. Not a good book for me."
2,Awkward and dated,I really don't care much for Hogarth's style or drawing at all. This book was not worth the money I spent on it.
1,"The price is a joke...Seriously, it's a joke.","Considering this product is no longer made, I can only imagine how old this package is. I'm sure it's outdated and would be illegal to sell, what with the safety hazard of selling outdated food. This seller needs to be careful because he/she might find themselves being sued for that reason and their profit from marking this four dollar item to 128.00 will go to legal costs."
1,"misleading advertizing, inedible food","My daughter recieved an easy bake oven for Christmas. I had fond memories of mine in the sixties. But I remember being able to eat the food I made. We have tried a lot of receipes. The mac and cheese was disgusting, my daughter could not eat it. The ""pizza"" was disgusting, we had to add our own ketchup, the cake mix did not rise one iota and had to be scraped out of the pan.The brownie mix did not rise and also had to be scraped out of the pan. The descriptions of the food and picture on the very expensive packets are misleading and false advertising. From the size of the barbie size portion to the appearance of the food even when following the directions exactly. Horrible. I cringe every time my daughter wants to take it out to use. Don't waste your money, time or electricity."
1,so gross,"If there was 0 stars, that's what it would get. My kid INSISTED on buying this crap. I said it was okay, hoping she wouldn't eat it. Then she cooked it in her easy bake.. very excited about it.. and I absoloutly refused to let her eat it. It was GROSS. the smell was revolting. She ate it anyway and nearly threw up. Thanks but.. GROSS."
3,"Better than OKAY but not ""EPIC"".","I have had a lot of guitars and a lot of pickups. These are better than okay but not mind-blowing. They won't turn your strat into a shredder or a fat strat but they will give you a close to humbucking sound with good harmonics if you put them very close to the strings. They're not in the same league as a real fat-strat tone. They're ceramic. They're better than okay if you put them close to the strings, otherwise they're very meh.I usually love Seymour Duncan but in this case I would suggest going with another brand or better yet, getting a real humbucker. Keep in mind that I have very high quality gear and many guitars in which to compare them. I don't hate them but unless you raise them close to the strings and shroud them with distortion/fuzz/overdrive, they're a disappointment. Otherwise they're just okay, at best."
2,eh,"Sounds like he's learning production all over again. A big change from the polished, Quik/Dre-like beats from ROTR. Some of the slappers I could make on a MPC pretty quick. Some of the guest features are horrible. As are some of the sample choices.The only thing that keeps this from getting one starred is Ice Cube and B-Real on the same song."
2,In The Mid-Nit Hour Doesn't Work,"Warren G is a good rapper, he was decent in the 213 Album The Hardway, but this cd is a real dissappointment, although it has some good songs, the rest are throw away rehashes of the west coast Rap classics.I Hope Warren G Releases another album very soon, because this album is medicore.Thumbs Down."
5,"Excellent book, excellent service","The book was delivered in a very short time, by the way, it's an excellent book."
5,great,"what can I say its a Victorinox Swiss knife, my son needed it for electrical.It is small enough to take with him and he loves it!@"
4,Basic Hot Rods: Deluxe Information!,"Always wanted to build a rod, but couldn't afford the $60,000+ price tag? Or maybe you think your dream rod ideas would be considered a little too far left of centre. Tex Smith's Building Guide for Basic Hot Rods is the book you need!This book will arm you with the ideas and basic techniques required to build yourself an entry level rod on a beer budget.Covering all topics from finding the body and chassis,to choosing an engine and trans. Upholstery,suspension,steering,running fuel and brake lines,it's all here,written in an easy to understand style.The 194 pages featured plenty of finished cars,built to a budget,with tips and tech ideas from the rod owners thrown in.A coupes,modifieds,deuce roadsters,T buckets and others are all covered. How about using an abandoned Volvo as the donor car for your A model project? It's in here!A great book,full of ideas,both old and new.Definitely a must have in any D.I.Y. rodders library."
2,Not very good,"This book wasn't very good, although I guess I shouldn't complain because it was relatively inexpensive. Consists of reprints from an obscure hot rodding magazine I've never heard of, on uncoated paper (so the photo reproductions come out mediocre) by Tex Smith, who I remember reading in the 60's and 70's. I don't recommend this book."
4,An enjoyable piece of Romanov reading!,"This book is an enjoyable read for the serious or not so serious fan of the ill-fated Romanov dynasty. It is not too heavy and yet it is well researched. In her book, Zeepvat tells the tale of many of the personalities that made up this powerful ruling family. I would recommend it."
5,Great!,"A delightful collection of stories starting with the first Nicholas and Alexandra in 1817, winding it's way to a story about the Tsesarevich Alexei. Many lesser known members of the Imperial Family are here, many who are quite interesting in and of themselves!"
4,A must read for every single,"This book changed the way I see dating and committed relationships in general. I have been making so many mistakes and I now know why I've had my heart broken so many times. The author was single until around 40 so he knows how to navigate the single waters in a healthy way.He offers practical advice on how identify the real thing. Thanks Mr. Purnell, I feel grateful to you for sharing your experience. You said all the things that mom and dad were afraid to say."
2,One Great Song!,"I bought this for the song ""Don't Sit in My Pew"" with hopes the rest of the album would be just as great. Unfortunitely, the vocals are a little weak on the other songs and, as such, that's why I rated the album 2 stars. I paid $12 for it and maybe should have waited for a used copy.The songs are Southern Gospel with this husband/wife team on vocals and Eva Mae LeFevre accompanies them in singing ""Jesus Is the Waymaker,"" which is a fair sounding song."
2,One Great Song!,"I bought this for the song ""Don't Sit in My Pew"" with hopes the rest of the album would be just as great.

4,"Uneven, but certainly More than Just Okay","This is a solid score for a very good film. At times I tend to agree somewhat with at least one other reviewer who declared that the music has trouble standing on its own two legs, as opposed to being listened to as part of watching the movie itself. Another problem for me is that the individual tracks don't always flow smoothly from one to the next. That's often true of film scores, but not always. To me, the strongest part of the score is the main theme, which is stirring in the extreme but which also forms a very small percentage of the music here, which runs on toward about three-quarters of an hour. My own view is that this disc deserves 3.5 stars, but I'll bump it upward because I liked the film. There are some good moments here, but also a few somewhat tiresome minutes."
2,Cartridge,this product has 10 year manufacture Date. and wont be describ on the pague. i lost my money.
2,Not quite perfect,"I agree with Janet B, this was an HP brand, but the box was opened, and the plastic wrapper was open, and the seal strip was broken. Either this was used or remanufactured, and should be advertised as such. It works, but is not as good a deal as getting a genuine, new HP cartridge for this price."
1,Didn't work after only a few uses!,"The product came in a timely fashion, but, after only a few uses, black lines started showing up on the copies. Unfortunately, we had discarded the box to send back.We don't plan future purchases with this company. Be careful."
4,Some of the used ones are refurbished (or refilled).,"I bought this from one of the sellers that put it as USED/Like New. I called them before I bought it and made sure it was just refilled, which it was. If you are expecting genuine HP toner prepare to pay A LOT. If you need something that works, consider other toner options, they will do the same job and cost quite a bit less. If you are concerned make sure any seller you buy it from has a reasonable return policy."
1,Picture doesn't match description!,"If this is a ""compatible HP"" cartridge, as the title admits, why is a picture shown of an ACTUAL HP-manufactured cartridge. That is deceptive, and makes me think this is a company to avoid.Don't try to fool people here on Amazon - we all watch out for each other and point out deceptive discrepancies like this. If you're trying to deceive me, then I don't want what you're selling, no matter how good the price seems."
1,Made worst choice on this Toner,"Choosing this toner was very bad mistake. It looked very good at beginning but after 30 pages of pring, the toner was leaking all of my printer. I just called technician for service. I should not picked cheaper toner."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product with a great price for teachers who have to buy supplies for the classroom. The accelerated math program requires a lot of ink and papers. I have to purchase ink and paper for my classroom because the school can't afford to buy it for me to keep the program going. My students love the math program. Amazon.com has allow me to buy a great product at a reasonable price. I would recommend this product to anyone who is in need of the Laserjet 4 toner cartidge. Thank you for making the toner affordable to a math teacher who is trying to make a difference in the lives of our young people when their is a shortage of supplies in the schools like ink. Anyone who willing to make an ink or copier paper donation to help keep the program running, I would greatly appreciate the donation.Determine T"
5,Good!,Item was as stated in description and is a great value for the price. I would order again from this company.
2,"Did not print 6,500 pages","At most, I print maybe 3 pages a day using my printer. I think at most, 500 pages before this cartridge ran out."
2,Poor Print Quality,The product was received in a timely manner and was genuine HP toner. But for some reason the print quality from the new toner cartridge was extremely poor with a lot of dark smears on the printed paper. Maybe the low price was not such a bargain after all.
5,Toner cartridge,The toner cartridge arrived on schedule. I saved a lot of money on this purchase. The same toner cartridge sells for $139+ in the store.
2,Not that great,I was not very impressed with these cables when they arrived - at least not for $50 for 2x15 foot cables. I would have expected to pay $30-35 for these. The reviews on the web were much better than what I would give them. I am replacing my hand built 12 gauge cables that had AR connectors... I should have just bought more wire and done my own again.PROS- The cable shroud is nice. It's made of some sort of harder plastic so it slips through my entertainment center cabinet more easily than normal cables do. It's braided so it might collect more dust and dirt.- The cables don't kink easily and they lay flat easily.CONS- The banana connectors do not fit tightly at all. If you move the speaker around they can actually start unplugging on their own.- Not sure what the wire gauge is but it's maybe 16... not larger than 14 for sure. But 16 is ok too.
5,it really works,"My baby had serious eczema at age 2 months. After trying about 4 different kinds of creams and ointment none seemed to be able to control the rashes. My husband purchased this aveeno product to try and finally her skin has cleared up and the itching has gone completely. This has been a great relieve for us. Best of all, this product is not sticky. I love it and I am sticking to it. THANKS TO AVEENO"
2,Hard for general reader: too technical & theoretical.,"General readers may well be confused & misled by the introduction to this book, which indulges in what is known as ""reception theory"": according to this theory, Virgil's reception by readers through the ages has been marked by partiality & bias, which the present editor sets out to expose. He forgets that he, too, is a reader with an outlook rooted in a specific (our own) time. His own limitations as a reader become apparent when he produces a confused & reductive essay on Virgil's first major work, The Book of Bucolics (also known as eclogues) -- a source for the tradition of pastoral poetry in the West. Other scholars will no doubt find other essays to praise or blame in such a wide range, but no one, I think, will admire the theoretical posturing & self-involvement of the editorial frame. Those wishing a fuller discussion of issues raised by this book may reach me at the appended address."
1,History has shown what a great mistake this book was,"Authoritarian regimes all over the Third World, including the Arab World, have had their acolytes within Washington-based policy-making circles and among so-called detached 'experts'. Here's an example of the most harrowing kind. Human rights abuses were considered a mere 'dark spot', the absence of democracy not particularly troubling in the broader scheme of things, and neither was the existence of a greedy state elite in Tunisia. As long as they were anti-Islamist then these elites were fine, from such a point of view. And now we see that masses of ordinary people have risen up against these supposedly benign, enlightened regimes that were the favourite of the author and her ilk. The author should feel a sense of great shame, if not the need to explain how absolutely wrong the work was."
4,Most helpful book,If you are looking for one book on this toy breed this is probably it.It covers all aspects of the Yorkie - Elaine didn't leave anything out!I've had several Yorkies and was looking for another when I found this book.Wish I had seen this book 20 years ago!
2,snobby,"I found the book contrary. She mentions to walk your dog at least10 minutes a day, then goes on to say that the Yorkie can getenough exercise in the house. Elaine also impliedthat unless your Yorkie was of championship quality, you shouldnot breed it.You may not find homes for them she says. Fat chance. Yorkie's are a most beloved breed and just because they are not ""champs"" does not mean that you should not breed them. I own 2 Yorkie's who have papers, but are not from champions. I do not care about the accomplishments of their relatives. They are both ""fixed"", but only because I do not wish to be a breeder, not because they are inferior to the champions. So, I have a bookavailable should any one want it."
4,Dancing in the Light,"Susann Möller's collection of poetry I Dance In Your Light That Is Also My Own offers a lot for those who are looking for fresh insights. Born in Germany, Möller writes in English with native fluency, but with the unique perspective that can come only from alien eyes. Although poets are usually highly creative with language, Möller is exceptionally so. She operates in a realm within English unperceived by most of us, visiting forgotten or little known nooks and crannies of our language. She writes passages that simply would not occur to those who were born and raised in an English-speaking country. Some of her poems may be obscure at first for those who have no background in the classics or ancient mythology, but the context is usually helpful. One of my favorites is ""Trail of Tears."""
4,"Top act, but not top release","I'm a huge fan of Tim Reynolds, and was long before the Dave Matthews Band gave him name recognition far beyond the Virginia/Carolinas area. But I'm *especially* a fan of his work with Robert Jospe (drummer, also of the Charlottesville Swing Orchestra and a number of other central VA acts).This release has Pete Katz on bass - not bad, but the original tour de TR3 force involved Warren Richardson on bass. He brought along some cheesy lyrics, though not as bad as the Flecktones' Futureman, or Galactic's - and he was a crucial part of the sound, at least as I came to love it.To hear Warren, look for the earlier TR3 release SHIFTING CURRENTS. You may also note a shift from a Middle Eastern-y vibe punctuated with funky rock on Currents, to something more ambiently psychadelic on Reynolds' later releases such as Gossip of the Neurons."
1,Are you fools the ones smoking crack now?,"Talk about revisionist history! I only bought this claptrap drivel out of curiousity, and boy, did I get good laughs out of this one... It's a great hit at parties, becuz most people can't believe this isn't strictly fiction, satire, or somebody's idea of a bad joke!! Can't stop the yuks when people ask me if anybody really believes this collosal waste of paper and ink... PT Barnum had you idiots in mind - suckers! Go back to your 'parallel universe' where this 'history' really happened. I tried to keep an open mind, but the only response was a near-hernia from doubling over with laughter!! I have no particular love for the black man, no more or less than for any other. I DO, however believe in the truth, as opposed to this incredible farce. Keep up the good work! Life's too serious as it is...THANKS!"
1,Easily debunked.,"So Kennedy doesn't think that slavery was a primary cause of the Civil War, eh?That would surely surprise the people who voted for South Carolina to secede.Read for yourself ""Declarations of Causes of Seceding StatesCivil War South Carolina.""Just paste the following in your browser:[...]It's pretty weak when a non-historian can knock the thesis of a faux history book down with five minutes of Googling."
3,27 Unassisted homebirths by Christian families,"If you like birth stories- this is a great book. The only problem I had with this book was the quality!!! The publishing of the cover, binding, and type were probably done at someone's home. Provides a good solid approach to childbirth as a normal event, and emphasis is placed on the choice of these couples to go unassisted. (without midwives or doctors)"
2,Too dismissive of real medical concerns,"Call me mainstream, but the stories in this book didn't make sense to me. In the years before medical births, many women and babies died. Yes, birth is a natural process, but that does not automatically make it safe, or easy. I felt the stories were too critical of ""the mainstream"" and just a bit too far out on the edge. Pregnant women are going through enough already without feeling the disapproval of both the mainstream medical establishment AND the hard-core ""organic"" anti-establishment. ALL our choices should be supported, including those of us who truly believe it is safer to have our children in a hospital."
1,"A Marketing Book, Not A Technical One...","The book miraculously avoids going into technical stuff. So I would guess it was meant to be for managers, and dummy ones for that matter! I'm not here to say Microsoft does not have anything to offer; it sure does. But to get a handle on that, you will have to go somewhere else, e.g. on the technical side, books by Don BOX, as an introduction to COM 'Inside COM' by Dale ROGERSON, as an introduction to DCOM 'Inside DCOM' by Guy EDDON...And for good measure, don't forget to listen to the other side of the story: read books on CORBA and JAVA, too!"
1,Insomnia problem Solved!!!,This book put my boss and myself to sleep in no time!!! I wonder if the author is serious about delivering the concepts. He talks about Gnomes and other beings to present information- A style not appreciated by geeks like me. I like the facts straight.
1,I need an aspirin!,"I wanted to learn about COM and DCOM.The back cover was completely misleading. Mr. Session's is extremely biased toward Microsoft. The organization of the book is maddening.The author takes the approach of creating an analogy between COM/DCOM and furry little creatures called ""gnomes"". At first it was amusing. Eventually I felt as though I was reading a bad children's story.I'm a technical person, and this book is not for the technical minded."
2,Endless waffling...,"The book covers some interesting topics...unfortunately, it's padded with endless storytelling and lousy jokes. I'd look elsewhere - there must be other books out there that present the same topics more thoroughly with fewer pages."
2,Oversimplified book that could be summarized in 10 pages,"This book only scratches the subject of COM, DCOM, and ""Microsoft's vision"". It does so in a verbose way, and when you finish reading the book (I read from cover to cover) you ask yourself ""why didn't I stop reading earlier?""... There are no in-depth explanations, the author remains almost always way too vague. There are much better books on the subject."
2,Clear evangelism rather than hard facts,"I have been working with distributed objects for years and purchased this book to obtain a better objective understanding of COM and DCOM, and it's place in the Distributed Object world. I was appalled at what in my opinion are blatant errors in reporting factual information about competing products and relevant merits. This in turn leads to a biased approach when examnining issues. In my opinion there are much better books available on this subject that examine issues in both a far more sophisticated and objective manner."
1,Terrible Book! Complete Waste of Money,The actual content is about 20 pages in this book - the rest are silly analogies and jokes. Go to the MS web site - it is cheaper & accurate.
1,Horrible as a Technical Book and Painful as a Novel,This book is neither technical in content nor amusing to read as a novel. I bought the book after going through the publisher's blurb on the author and his background. Definitely author is an authority on the subject but in his goal to educate the readers he failed. Nor the style was good. Even an ill written technical book of 480 pages can not be read in 8 hour time. This one you can easily finish in that time.
1,Warm and fuzzy feeling for sale,"I did not spend enough time reading this book - in the bookstore, that is. I was looking for ""an expert's unbiased appraisal of Microsoft's object technologies"". This is what it actually says on the back cover and what made me get it - alas too quickly.The book is _very_ biased, and instead of an appraisal, you get the praise of Microsoft's object technologies - something MS are very good at themselves, thank you. I was looking for an unbiased opinion to contrast the MS marketing hype, and instead, got more of the same.The book is not, in my opinion, written by an expert either. Mr. Sessions talks about a lot of topics he seems only remotely familiar with.If you want to buy the warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing where MS and the IT world at large is headed to, the warm and fuzzly feeling of knowing everything about COM/DCOM/MTS/... that you need to know, get this book."
1,A book to mislead newcomers,"I attended Sessions' seminar, and the book was distributed among the participants for free. That was a right price! Unfortunately, I had to pay for the seminar. The book (and his seminar) is simply a collection of incomlete and very much biased opinions, without a deep analisys. Here is an example of Sessions' logic: at the seminar he presented code samples using COM and CORBA. He made a statement that COM required less coding based on a number of lines in his COM and CORBA samples that were written in different programming languages! Both his seminar and his book give you a lot of words, definitions, but at the same time you don't learn much. The book tries to explain huge amount of complex topics. The bad thing is that it very often does it wrong."
5,Terrible Book,This author is lucky there are so few books on the subject thus far. This book only serves to confuse and I would not recommend it to anyone. There are two good books on the subject thus far that I have read. The first is the Internet Information Server Resource Kit. The second is Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0 by Roger Jennings
1,Is this book sponsored by Microsoft ?,"I don't feel like reading books that contains statements like the following [page 151]:""...If you try implementing a serious businessoriented component in C++, C, Visual Basic and Java, it will take you no time to conclude that Java is by far the best choice. But if you try implementing a serious client user interface in C++, C, Visual Basic, and Java, it will take you no time to conclude that Java is by far one of the worst choices (followed closely by C++ and C). ...""So, I'm thinking about, whether the author really knows something about Java.The last section [page 470] contains a strange comparison between Java/CORBA and Microsoft's DNA. But how can one compare these things with one another. As anybody knows, is Microsoft's DNA more in BETA phase right now and who knows whether it will work ever."
5,Teacher worthy,I have used this book collaboratively with 3 & 4th grades at an inner city school. The rich information and fantastic illustrations are a perfect stimulant to lessons in language arts as well as dance and painting.
2,the end of an era.,"really, what worries me more about this documentary thingamajig is the way in which it changes exactly what Belle & Sebastian are. they're really discarding their somewhat mysterious mantel and taking on a much more public face, particularly with their glossy, Trevor Horn-produced new album (which is possibly their spottiest overall, except perhaps 'fold your hands child you walk like a peasant'...not a criticism of the work itself, really, but merely mourning for a band becoming something more...for lack of a better word, commercial."
2,Don't Get Me Wrong...,"I feel I should preface by saying that I love this band to death. However, For Fans Only is pretty shoddy. Every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect. That being said, it's not without merit. I just wish it had been put together better."
3,can't really control the plane,"you throw and it crashes, and you throw it again; repeat those steps maybe three gillion times, and the plane will brake. I have had this for 4 days now, and the first time I tried it, it crashed. Then, the second time I got flying; it flew around in circles refusing to respond to the controller, finally it flew way off into the woods somewhere, after an hour of looking for it I finally saw it in one piece in the grass. The next day I tried it again, it started flying on the first throw, I steered around a little when the wind flipped upside down, and it crashed nose first into the grass, and it's still in good condition, I tried getting it to fly 5 more times without any success, so all in all it is hard to get to fly, and impossible to control. I don't really like this Air Hogs product, but if you like to spend a fortune on batteries, and throw an air plane that flies around for 2 seconds then crashes; then your all set go ahead and buy this piece of junk."
2,RC SKYWINDER AIRPLANE,"PURCHASED MANY AIR HOG PRODUCTS FOR MY SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE RECEIVED 2 FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, HAD TO BRING ONE BACK 2 TIMES AS IT KEPT ON BREAKING, AND ALL THE AIRPLANES HAVE LITTLE POWER, SHORT LIVED TOYS. I THINK THE COMPANY COULD DO BETTER IN BUILDING THESE PLANES, THE PUMP ONES ARE NO BETTER. I DO NOT PURCHASE ANY AIR HOGS ANYMORE."
2,short lasting fun,"i got this for my son for christmas, he is 9. he loved, couldn't wait to fly it. He was doing great and then the tail wing on top broke off in a dive crash. Difficult for even his dad to control. We will be sending it back."
4,only good if you have a little expierience,"the two motor idea is a way to make it cheaper, but this really doesn't help its turning ability. up and down is pretty good with the elevator in the back, so this is a plus. this plane is not something to be flown in much wind though. if there is some wind and you want to go flying, then ignore the directions and throw it with the wind, not into it, unless of course you like to go into stalls and crash. i have successfully done a flip with this thing, so it can be done, but it is kinda hard. i really don't get why some many reviews on here say its junk, it may not be on the higher end of quality, but its pretty darn good if you don't want to spend $300. overall, this plane is among the best and most complicated air hogs out there so far. i'm going to get an air hogs Titan RC plane pretty soon, so i'll probably make a review for that as well and see if i can say something positive about it."
3,Useful and Informative,"A useful and informative book outlining in a question and answer debate the merits of raw food, as well as some of the authors meal lists etc.The book is very good for new raw food eaters, and or doctors who desire to hear what another doctor has to say about raw food, which can be quite valuable.However, I enjoy more recipes and perhaps was hopping there would be more. Still, for the cost its very worthwhile to add to your collection."
2,This is an OLD book,I wish I had known that this book was written over 100 ago. I don't think I would have spent the money for it.
2,Another Let Down From MYA - Add It To A Long List...,"There`s no point in reviewing the film, as it`s barely watchable, having been transfer-sourced from a lousy VHS print with muddy contrast, washed out colors, so annoying you can`t pay attention to the film or the reasons we buy this purile trash. Avoid entirely until Synapse, Severin, Mondo Macabro or another QUALITY provider releases it. Three-quarters of MYA's releases aren`t worth the time or money invested - it`s time for death-threats 'till they start respecting their audience, and stop letting us down in every conceivable way... 'Sweet' my ass..."
1,Buyer Beware - FALSE PICTURE ALERT!!,"As of 9 Dec 2005, the product picture shows the filter as being for a PUR Ultimate system, but what is actually sent are filters for a completely different system - 3 stage. They will not work in the Ultimate system. Shame on Target and Amazon for their attempt at deceit or ignorance in product visualization."
3,A Little Disappointing,"The book contains everything that you need to know, however, it is a bit hard to navigate. The small type and lack of an easy cross-referrence index makes it cumbersome to use. It's on the shelf waiting for its trip to the donation box at the local library. It's just not what I expected."
5,"Excellent picture and value, pivot feature is nice too","Graphics are bright and sharp. Contrast is great. Nice large viewing area (I'm used to CRTs that say they're 19"" but the actual viewing area is more like 18""). For some reason text was fuzzy at first, but then I stumbled upon the ""auto"" adjustment for contrast and brightness and now the text is perfect too. Pivot feature works surprisingly well and will come in handy for page layout where a vertical format is better. I love this monitor!"
2,Old technology gives so-so image quality,"The SM 910t uses old LCD technology which results in slow response time (25 ms is no longer acceptable today) and poor viewing angle compared to many better LCD monitors from companies like NEC and BenQ and Sharp. In fact, you'll get a much better monitor at a much better price if you check out the 19"" monitors from Sceptre and AG Neovo, two relatively new brands that nonetheless are selling LCDs of very high quality. Steer away from last-generation monitors like this one.E-mail me if you have any LCD questions."
3,LACKING IN AREAS,"So far (1 hour), the monitor is working. It arrived with a faulty printer cable and no screws to attach the base to the monitor. We've got our fingers crossed."
1,Avoid at all cost,"Don't be fooled by Samsung's reputation - those days are gone. I have been using 152T for more than 2 years and it was excellent. But this model, in particular, is full of problems. I bought one, and had to send it back for replacement (twice), yet each replacement comes with new defects (unbalanced brightness, noisy panel etc). Imagine: 3 defective units in a row (all brand new), does that give you any idea about its manufacturing quality? I ended up with a refurbished unit from Samsung, which is mediocre in quality (the panel is *not* as clear and as bright as a new unit).If you want to take the risk, go ahead. But I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great soup ladles!,"I ordered two sets of these for our Relay for Life Soup-a-palooza, and they worked perfect to serve a consistent amount of soup for tasting."
3,Poor organization,"The book contains wonderful information, but it is organized so poorly! The books lists information by miracle type, and then lists the saints that performed that particular miracle. The book would be much better if it was the other way around: List the saints, and then the miracles that those saints performed."
1,HOLY COW,"Saw this disc in a review in Vintage Guitar Magazine Review, and these guys are top notch in reviewing musicians, so I said, it is a purchase!Let me say this, she is by far the most unsung guitarist in the blues/rock genre. The flow of notes, and sheer bombastic volume of this disc will make the hair on your neck stand up, and say "" This is a chick, playing this"". No disrespect to the women of blues/rock, but HOLY COW.I am getting the remainder of her catalog today.Kelly my dear, you go girl!Cowboy Craig of the Coastal Bend!"
1,Just...no.,"I'm trying to understand and see the talent that other people seem to find in this group. As of now, I can't. This rendition of Photograph? Awful. I didn't know it was possible to screw up a song quite so badly. Even if it wasn't a Def Leppard song (Which, come on, you can't outdo Def Leppard), the vocals are just horrible. I would not recommend buying this single whatsoever. And (and I know I'm setting myself up here, lol) Don't rate this review ""not helpful"" just because you don't happen to agree with my opinion. If we all agreed on here, what would be the point of posting what we think? :)"
5,barbara and howard..,it is fabulous..have listened to it many many times....sounds and lyrics great...very catchy...also saw it on cmt and it is so exciting..cant wait for more...exciting new group great addition to country muscic....
5,For my 9 year old daughter,"My daughter absolutely loves ""Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie"". She wanted to watch it over and over again. The packaging was brand new and everything was just as described. :0)"
1,this movie = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie is lame and boring nothing cool happens in this movie its lame boring dull and yes seriously annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Robotic,"Another collaborative effort by Disney the money making corporation and conspirators amongst all the developed, developing and undeveloped nations of the world to continue to lower the creative, rational and any other form of intelligence standards of American youth (well, parents too but they're already on the decline). If this movie and it's TV analogues is mental exercise then I can do nothing but feel sorry those who regard this as creative/challenging/stimulating entertainment.Anyway, just another Disney production of robotic acting, dialogues and contrived artificial beyond plastic scenes too continuously numerous to enumerate.Five star reviewers please indicate educational level achieved unless you also happen to work for Disney in which case we forgive you (and your bank account)."
5,Great movie,This is an outstanding movie for fans of the show. It also has some memorable lines in it and it really provides good lessons for kids.
2,bad fit,I did not appreciate the 'structured' fit. Gives your head a 'cone like' feel. Not very happy with it. The hat sits in my office as a Husker memorabilia.
3,To The Far Blue Mountains,"Book #2 in the Sackett Series finds Barnabas Sackett traveling to the wilds of America. He leaves England a sought after man. Thought to have stolen a hidden treasure. Along the way he meets up with many new charatcters, some good some bad. There are fights with the indians and the pirates that are sailing the high seas. The adventure take place from 1600 to 1620. The ending was a bit of a surprise for me. There are a few weddings, but the romantic part isn't really detailed.I bought most of the Sackett series in 1998 - 1999 and am just getting around to reading them now."
5,A superbly written adventure story,"Dramatically narrated by John Curless, To The Far Blue Mountains is an flawlessly recorded audiobook presentation of yet another of Louis L'Amour's classic western novels featuring the hardy endurance of the Sackett clan as they addressed the challenges of life in the Old West. To The Far Blue Mountains follows Barnabas Sackett, who is on the run with his steadfast wife Abigail and his only escape is to the west. This is a superbly written adventure story of earning a life for oneself on the frontier, surviving all manner of hazards both human and environmental, and eventually prospering despite the hostilities of nature and man alike. To The Far Blue Mountains is an enthusiastically recommended audiobook for personal and community library collections!"
5,To The Far Blue Mountains (The Sacketts),Great book and very happy with it and the service I get. I would like to own all Louis L'Amour books
1,I just don't get it...,"Why all the clamore for this book?Aside from Norman's clear biases and regular inaccuracies (Piggies is a song about people who eat meat?? Delaney & Bonnie were a hillbilly band??) his writing style is like that of a precocious teenager. Then there are the passages I read over again and still came away wondering what he meant.I'm so glad I picked up this book for free (it's the original edition.) I'm also glad I only read it to pass the time on a cardio machine.Finally, the fact that none of the Beatles agreed to be interviewed for the book should put you on guard."
4,Pretty much everything the average person wanted to know (and more!) about The Beatles,"I'll be honest; I bought this book for a course on the Beatles and expected it, like all other textbooks, to be rather dry. But it was actually enjoyable to read. However, it might have contained a bit toooo much for the average Beatles' fan (i.e., myself). Some details seemed rather pointless, like the author wrote them in just so he could show how much he had researched the band. The book seems long just by looking at it, but you don't really know how many minute and seemingly insignificant details the author left in until you actually start reading. Interesting stuff for the most part, though."
3,Wonderful information,This book taught me many things about the Beatles and what they were thinking during the height of their career.
5,Required Text on the Syllabus for Beatles 101,"If you read nothing more than this book and The Love You Make, you're pretty much set. I don't understand why Paul, probably my favorite Beatle, detests this book so much. This was the second book I ever read on the Beatles when I was sixteen years old, and when I re-read it twelve years later, having read another thirty or forty Beatles books in the interim, it only improved in my estimation. The story of The Beatles is inherently romantic and dramatic and Norman's narrative makes fantastic use of those qualities. The end of book is genuinely moving and sad. I hope Paul reconsiders his opinion. Even my private tour guide in Liverpool conceded this book's pretty much the one to read on the subject, although certainly many other wonderful books on the boys are out there. Highly, highly recommended."
3,good but...,"this is a good book, but norman really drags it out! no offence to any one (belive me i am CRAZY about the beatles! ) but this book is just plain boring! it does a bad job of capturing the beatles essence, and just left the facts. it is better as a reference then a book to sit down to read. sorry, but that is the truth!"
4,"Well written and research, but you have to wonder....","Norman's done his homework, and this is a truly fascinating and detailed account of the Beatles. Still, one has to wonder if Norman actually likes the Beatles, on several occasions he seems to revel in reporting sordid episodes and Beatle pet peeves that, while interesting to note, don't always seem relevant. All in all, one of the better accounts."
5,Different perspective arguing against Paul bias,"I'm surprised that ppl so far thought that the book was biased against Paul. I'm not the greatest when it comes to picking up tone, but Maybe I'm Amazed that the reviews so far could Imagine that the author rips on Paul. Even tho he praises John a lot, I think, if anything, the book is biased against him. I am a new fan, and love Paul, but it is widely known that he could be controlling. The author narrates how Paul wanted to go on performing live, while John was so into Yoko that he couldn't see the Beatles' interests anymore. That's just one example. Anyway, the book is great, and I just wanted to provide a different perspective. I just finished it, and if anyone wants to discuss it, e-mail me."
2,Burn wholesale is a fitting name.,"I got BURNED. This Lighter is not as PICTURED or as LISTED. Its NOT ENGRAVED but, PRINTED. Like a sticker."
5,"Not H-D fan, but am still impressed","A very nice lighter. Great design. Great engraving job. Excellent quality. I am not a big fan of Harley-Davidson, but I will recommend this lighter to anyone."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"While reading this book, I kept wondering when the good part would begin. The trip to London had little to do with the plot. Not a good read at all."
1,Appallingly Awful,"Now I know why this book was 50 cents at a book warehouse. I advise you not to spend so much on it. The first 106 pages are where the action is and are interesting, if tame. You can then skip from there to about 10 pages from the end, and you will have read the substance of the book. Better still, save time: Read the first 106 pages and then email me and I will tell you who did it and you can move on to another book! Such an otherwise good author, what was she thinking?"
1,Do people actually talk like this?,"I picked up this book today from the library because the description sounded perfect for a lazy summer's day read. The only problem was that I was put off by the writing immediately when the word ""fey"" or some variation of it was used three times in the first part to describe Carly and Katie. The dialogue, however, was what forced me to stop reading. Do people actually say, ""I hope that's going to be in the affirmative?"" or ""Oh, very nice indeed."" I am twenty-five, close to Katie's age, and i never speak like that. Plus, as an English teacher, I constantly tell my students to use dialogue effectively to reveal important thoughts, feelings, or relationships. Not to tell an entire story."
1,The Triumph of Awful Writing,"Disclaimer: I read this book for work, otherwise I would never have wasted even a moment of my time with it.Barbara Taylor Bradford is a wonderful example of a fairly accurate generalization about publishing: If you want to sell millions of books, you've got a great chance if you're a terrible writer. Her simple-minded plots are what most critics rip apart, but the plots seem strong compared to her dialogue. HINT: If your dialogue doesn't sound like natural speech, it's probably bad dialogue. And now, two examples....""Oh, get along with you Katie, 'tis not important, and I'm feeling much better today.""""Try not to worry, Katie, me darlin'. And don't forget what I've forever drummed into you...there's nothing worse than anticipatory despair, 'tis debilitating, for one thing, and a waste of precious time for another.""I can think of another way to waste precious time. Read this awful book."
1,A book of boring facts about Emily Bronte,"The book started off well, with close friends and a tragic event. But then Katie goes to England and more than half of the book is her learning about Emily Bronte. Nothing to do with the plot. Then, the mystery is solved in about 10 pages, and it's no one connected with the plot. Awful book. Not Barbara Taylor Bradford's style at all, try her older stuff."
2,A let down,"I've never read a Barbara Taylor Bradford book before, and read this one on a friend's recommendation. For anyone who has read Valley of the Dolls -- does this not remind you of Anne Well's story, plus a murder and minus pill-popping? Maybe it's just me. I liked Valley of the Dolls. I did not like The Triumph of Katie Byrne. I was waiting for something surprising to occur ... or at least an original depiction of story that has become a little too commonplace in today's literature. (Not to diminish the seriousness of the issue) ..."
1,I would give 0 Stars if it were possible,"Most immature, poorly written book I've read, possibly ever. I read it at a beach house on vacation, and it made me angry enough for me to search for it here. She should be ashamed of this lazy writing with idle words and pointless details just to fill a page quota."
1,The Triumph of Katie Byrne,"It was suppose to be a mystery but it wandered through England on a totally unconnected line. The conclusion was very weak on the murder, the murderer ( was not connected to the story) and who was the man the victim had been with before the rape. Too many loose ends and a very boring middle. I've have always been a great fan - wish I had my money back on this one."
1,Blech,This has got to be the worst book ever written. Phony characters and an even stupider plot. I am just glad I did not waste my eyesight reading it and listened to it on CD. I did not even finish it. This was disappointing as her books on the Harte family were engrossing.
1,Worst Dialogue I've Ever Read!,"This dialogue was PAINFUL to read. My 9 year-old Goddaughter can write better dialogue in her stories that this stuff! Luckily, I only paid 75 cents for the book at a clearance book sale. Save your money. Turns out this book wasn't even worth the 75 cents I paid for it!"
1,Does the Author or Publisher employ a Proof Reader?,"Dollar signs must have been in the eyes of the Author and Publisher of this amateurish attempt at a mystery story. Was it a fourth grade assignment for a young relative of Barbara's?There was no cohesiveness (I don't have a Proofreader either) to this book. The characters were both undeveloped and unbelievable. The only amusing part was when one of the very boring characters in England was described as a double of the author of the book. Thank goodness I took this out of my local library; therefore, costing me nothing but time. Shame on you, Barbara."
1,A Mystery? or Boring!,"No twist, no turns, actually boring. As others noted BTB suggested mystery about some of the English characters and never expanded on them. The mystery and ending were horrible. Everything was so easily pulled together. The first part of the book showed promised but the second half got continually worse until it just ended!"
2,Fair,Definitely not the best book that I've read but also not the worse. It would have made an exceptional short story but the book contained to many areas that dragged. The author has a smooth writing style and did a great job with character development. Not a great book and not a total waste of time.
1,"a reader from wantagh,ny","i'm on page 175, and i just keep wondering when the story wll get going. if this is as good as it's going to get, i'm going to have to start rethinking my choice of authors. so far this year, i have barely made it through a nora roberts book and now this one may never end. are all my favorite authors on retreat or are publishers doing with books what they do with movies and saving the good ones for the summer. i don't even care how this ends, but as far as i'm concerned it's over for me. i think i'll go buy a magazine."
1,The Triumphant Dissapointment of Katie Byrne,"Oh, boy. You know, sometimes you read a book and hope that it turns out good, so you truck along to the end? Do you know the feeling when it isn't? The feeling that you've wasted your time reading fluff? If you like that, then I suggest ""Katie Byrne"" very highly. Taylor-Bradford drags the reader on a long stint of Yorkshire, mercilessly. To me, it seems that there will never be a point. This book is an undeserving murder mystery, man (or in this case, woman) vs. self imitaion of those books who pull of the trick nicely."
1,What was I thinking.........,"What a piece of dreck! Luckily for me, I didn't buy the book but got it from the library. I won't go into a rehash of the plot, you can get that above. Suffise to say that it is poorly written, with no characters that even interest you, and the ending is entirely implausible. I can only assume that BTB has a book contract to fufill and her publisher is willing to publish her grocery list if need be!"
3,Out of touch with middle America,"If you wish to travel to Europe and make a living in the bar industry, or you have a time machine and want to operate an establishment in the 1940's United States, this book would be fine. Many concepts and notions feel dated, and I was left with the notion that Americans are viewed with disdain, far too immature and lacking in class to appreciate English pubs or French cafe's that haven't changed in 100 years. To be fair, there are many facts and ideas that are worth reviewing contained within, but I feel I was better served by titles written by Roy S. Alonzo or Bruce Fier. In my opinion, Mr. Egerton-Thomas is thoroughly convinced that the European way is the best way, and this is clearly reflected in his writing. Perhaps this book would be better entitled, ""How To Manage a Successful Snooty English Bar""."
3,"For technical audiences, a good, up-to-date VPN book.","This is a technically rich book for understanding VPN architectures. If you are interested in packet structures, tunnel options, negotiation processes, design considerations, and VPN algorithms, this is a good book for you. Although the non-technical audience might be put off by the technical depth, a systems engineer will be delighted. If you want to know how IKE is negotiated - and where to put your firewalls - buy this book. If you want to know more about the business advantages of VPNs, plus good technical information, look up Dave Kosiur's Building and Managing Virtual Private Networks."
3,Decent technical depth but choppy and very IBM-centric,"The book gave decent technical detail but did not flow well - too choppy for me. Also, the book was very IBM centric. It should have been titled - Excerpts of Virtual Private Networking and IBM Sales Guide."
3,Didn't fit my Samsung Phone,"I had given the review one star, but improved to three stars after the seller called me up and refunded the shipping charge after my one star review. Still, I'm out $8 because the product did not fit my Samsung phone (a common model sold by ATT) and I want other buyers from making the same mistake I did. The seller faulted Amazon's product description of the product."
5,Great resource/study tool!,"This bible is in a great translation if you are just starting to read the Bible. I'm using if for college and the extra study tips and tools available are amazing. You have everything in one place: the text, space to write and take notes, and tips on what you are looking for. The study tips and advice in this inductive study bible compliment what my textbooks and professors in my classes are teaching!"
4,Awesome Bible,This bible has great study helps that allow you to go deeper into God's word. I highly recommend it!!
3,difficult font,the book shows a really good method of study but the font is really hard for me to read. I'll pass the book along to someone who can use it.
2,"Think for yourself, except here","I bought this bible during an intense time of questioning. I hoped it would allow me to really dive in and answer questions for myself. The introduction urged me to do just that, but when I opened to Genesis, I began to notice that the editors in fact DID give me what to think - - after demanding I think for myself. I ended up regifting this item. The ""leather bound"" exterior left a lot to be desired as well. I was afraid to actually open it for fear of breaking the binding."
5,A Thanks Note,"Thanks for your kindness and the understanding in this situation. The whole Dept decerve respect for the professional in conducting your business with ethic and honesty. I personally thanks for trying to help me in the best you thought you could and for the understanding with my economical situation. I'm a reader and I do sometimes the impossible to get some books, specially Bibles from differents authors so I can get the most of it. Again thanks for your help and receive my appreciation, Luis"
5,New Inductive Study Bible,This is a great study Bible. Kay Arthur's approach to Bible study is new to me. She teaches you how to dig through the word to get the most out of your study.
3,THE KAY ARTHUR INDUCTIVE STUDY BIBLE,A VERY GOOD STUDY BIBLE THAT IS EXCELLENT TO ENHANCE THE PRECEPT STUDIES.
5,A Must have for Precept & Any Serious Bible Students,"This Bible is so worth the investment. I highly recommend it to all who desire to better understand the mysteries and sometimes confusion that we find when we attempt to make sense of this amazing book.I have been taking the Precept Inductive Study Classes and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Study Bible follows the Precept Study method of Observation, Interpretation and Application. It's a completely thorough step by step word by word study approach that is very satisfying and doesn't disappoint. The format is wonderful with plenty of room to add notes on the pages. It is filled with tons of historical information throughout. Thorough and concise approach to learning!"
4,Nice!,"I have enjoyed having this bible for awhile now. Wide margins, to jot notes, if that is your style. Suggestions on how to do inductive bible studies. Some references, but not quite as many as I'd like. Overall, very worth it."
5,This Bible is excellent!!,"As a person who owns several Bibles, I found this one to be an excellent addition. The reason I purchased it was because I had just joined a group that was doing an inductive Bible Study. This Bible has given me a much better understanding of how to do that. This method of Bible Study makes the Bible more relevant and personal. I would recommend this Bible to anyone interested in an additional way to study, whether your on your own or in a group."
5,Incredibly Awesome,I love the smaller size of this Inductive Study Bible. I would highly recommend it to anyone who desires a deeper study of the Word using this method. It is easy to read and has all the instructions one would need to use the inductive method of Bible study. I don't even object to the hard cover. I give this Bible a 5 star rating without reservation.
2,Nice Pictures But A Disappointment,This is not of the quality I had hoped. Might be worth seeing for the relatively few pictures of a few of the major remains in this odd Hellenic-Roman city used in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Obviously this was scripted and shot without any research.
3,This is very historical.,"This DVD is all about the history behind Petra. I was hoping to see more photos or video of what is there. I left with mixed emotions because I now know more, but wished to see more actual photos."
5,PA' MI ES EL MEJOR,"PARA MI EL ES EL MEJOR CANTAUTOR QUE HAY PORQUE ,PERSONALMENTE AMI ME GUSTA LA MUSICA DE BANDA Y MAS LA DE PANCHO EL ES UN AUTOR QUE NO HA SIDO RECONOCIDO POR LO QUE ES, EL TIENE 5 CD'S COMO SOLISTA TODOS CON 12 CANCIONES CADA UNO Y TODAS LAS CANCIONES COMPUESTAS POR EL,ADEMAS DE TODAS LAS CANCIONES QUE YA TENIA COMPUESTAS CON LAS OTRAS BANDAS A LAS QUE PERTENECIO POCOS ARTISTAS COMPONEN SU PROPIO MATERIAL Y OTROS ARTISTAS QUE SOLO PORQUE CANTAN BONITO Y ESTAN GUAPOS SON RECONOCIDOS, PERO NO LE LLEGAN NI ALO TALONES A PANCHO,Y TODAS LAS CANCIONES TIENEN SENTIDO Y RITMO NO ES NADA MAS SOLO COMPONER A LO MENSO PERO SU VOZ ES LO MEJOR DE EL Y MAS EN VIVO NO COMO OTROS MUY FAMOSOS QUE SOLO SE DEDICAN AL PURO PLAYBACK.EN FIN ES UN TAlento que no a sido reconocido en su totalidad.ATTE.CARLOS VAZQUEZ"
4,thorough,"The dictionary is very thorough and useful especially for scholars and students. It is not an ordinary dictionary with just explanations but it also provides information about coptic literature, where a certain word could be found. The main difficulty is, that it is not easily scanned, but you have to put a lot of effort if you want to find just a certain datum."
1,Wrong product...,"The item in this picture is not what we recieved. Instead, we received a mini-tong, which would have worked great in an olive service or sugar cube bowl. The picture is quite misleading."
5,More elegant than kitchen tongs,Just what I was looking for -- something to pick up asparagus spears that's more elegant than our kitchen tongs!
2,Item not as described,I received two of these as gifts from my wishlist. What I received was not the item shown or described. The tongs were about four inches in length and only large enough to pickup something the size of a sugar cube. Probably an error in labeling at the warehouse. Amazon was great with the return.
4,Excellent Work of Scholarship,"Mr. Kitchen, as an expert in deciphering ancient texts, does a very good job of debunking some of the anti-scriptural pronouncements of self-styled authorities on historical background related to the Bible.The careful detail with which he outlines his findings is of course necessary for his work to have academic credibility, but it makes for a tough read. The information is very valuable for those of us who need to see such first-hand, detailed examination of the background history behind the Bible, and his careful and objective approach is greatly appreciated. Perhaps it is not realistic to have hoped for a volume more easy to read for the layman."
4,A Massive Maximalist Counterattack,"K.A. Kitchen is one of the most learned and well-read orientalists in the world today, and his effort in this book shows it. This is the kind of broadside against minimalizing tendencies that many have been waiting for. OROT is thorough and detailed, but covers so much that it leaves you wanting more. Upon finishing it the reader will likely come to the realization that the subjects for nearly every chapter require whole volumes in and of themselves. Sometimes I wish Kitchen had divided the book into separate parts so that he could make space for fleshing out his arguments more. Nonetheless this is an enjoyable and useful read that will bring students of Old Testament/Ancient Near Eastern studies to understand why maximalists can't be dismissed with the wave of a hand as merely ignorant fundamentalists or ""red state"" evangelicals."
2,Conservative Evangelical Fundamentalist,"Mr Kenneth Kitchen is a conservative, evangelical christian fundamentalist. He is also very knowledgable of the subject matter of this book. Unfortunately his brand of christianity appears to lead him to select only evidence that supports his beliefs. This book is about belief rather than objective research.It is religion and rather poor quality history. The result is regratable because the author clearly has the basic knowledge to tackle the subject. Unfortunately his religion constantly obstructs objectivity. A disappointing work."
1,"Close your eyes, and BELIEVE","Of course, if you choose which evidence to present, you can make a straw man of each contesting view and proceed to demolish them. Just ignore the inconvenient evidence. Don't bother to site the more recent archeological studies. Omit to mention that certain conclusions have been revised or abandoned, even by their original proponents.I guess that there is a market for this sort of book, but it's not amongst persons hoping to achieve a better understanding of the history of the era as revealed by archeology. Even those who looked for Troy based on Homer's epic did not go further and postulate that Apollo therefore existed since there was a ruined city of Troy, or that this indicated proof of the voyage of Aenias.Put this book in the religious section of your bookshelf, not in the history section, and rest confident that there are those who would rather close their eyes and believe in a sun than open their eyes and see its reality."
1,This series of tapes were defective.,"I had purchased ""America-By-Air"" - Vol #3 when it first was offered on VHS. I was unable to find the first 2 volumes. This was pre-internet. (1983) Jump ahead 25 years and; lo & behold, Amazon had a vendor offering the complete 3-volume set (Used) for sale. I ordered same. When the set arrived and attempted to play -- the tapes would NOT track properly; skipped through tracks; sound track would be garbled or not play at all. I contacted the vendor and relayed the problems I was experiencing. The vendor stated he had bought the set from a ""GOODWILL Industries "" outlet. Sorry 'bout that!!!I located the original producer of the series and he was willing to transfer the Master Tapes onto DVDs. And included all the original inserts.Cost me approximately $65, but worth every cent."
3,Romance or Mystery,I read quite a bit of the Historical Mysteries and this one fits into my one of my favorite series. I have read the previous two books by Royal and enjoyed them. I am a little put out with this one as it seems more like a romance/mystery. The prioress has the hots for one of the priests. This may be the line Royal is taking and if it gets deeper I may have to rethink her books. I love medieval mysteries and I hope this series will remain on my list.
2,Not her best effort,A bit boring. Too much time going over and over small facts when it was obvious all the time who did the murder.
4,worth the read,i like Eleanor and Thomas....her inner need to please her father and his tortured soul.....perfect qualities for nuns and monks in the 'unnlightened ages''. i think i've read all of these Tyndal Priory books and enjoyed them all. this book is not a 'tour de force' but it is worth the read certainly.
4,Sorrow without end,"Just recently have started to read midieval misteries. Although not a midieval mistery it was waiting for the final "" A Game of Thrones"" that got me started. After having read The Dark Monk which I particularly liked, I find this book equally well written, good midieval atmosphere (I think). particularly enjoyed the narrative about the era in which the story played."
3,well written story,"I liked the story, descriptions are good, introduced too many characters too early in the story for this busy mom, i catch a few pages on my smartphone as I can.. had to keep jumping back to remember who the characters were...."
2,You get what you pay for,"No false advertising - it shows an accurate photo except that mine came with a gap between the blue and the stripes on top. But it IS plastic and just may not be the quality you want to display on your car. I got what I paid for, but I should have thought more of what I was buying."
3,tag frame,The license plate frame we purchased was received promptly and serves it's anticipated purpose. Against the back drop of a white vehicle it appears to give a simple and attractive look to the rear of the car and we were able to turn it upside down after the last election.
4,Still very funny,"Laurie Notaro's move from eternal barfly to somewhat respectable office worker is clearly evidenced here in this very funny collection. From the creative director with the wine-mustache to supervisors who belong in a mental ward and not in management, Notaro tells tales of co-workers who make earning a pay check and paying the mortgage more difficult than it should be. Her essay on riding the elevator with rude, thoughtless and obnoxious co-workers is absolutely hilarious. The only time I felt that the collection got sort of boring was when she was whining about how her friends were all bitten by the ""let's have a baby bug"" and how she couldn't understand why they would choose to be with their new infants when she needed them. I have a feeling that we will be reading her somewhat skewed version of motherhood sometime in the near future. But all in all, this is a very funny little book with more than one laugh-out-loud moment. Definitely worth the read."
5,More Notaro please,"She's just really, really funny. I am guaranteed many fits of hysterical laughter which is why I buy her books every time they come out. She's a real person and the stories are eerily familiar (I suspect I'm not alone in this thinking) increasing their overall comedic value.Seriously, she brings the funny and the book is a good, fast read that makes you wish it had lasted a little longer."
4,Hilarious,I couldn't stop smiling. What a refreshing break from the worries of the day. I hope there is more to come from this author.
1,Did I miss something?,"Okay really? This is funny? Is this copied from some sort of ""How to be Funny for Dummies?"" I don't understand how anyone would find humor in this. It's forced and trying entirely too hard to be funny. I read the first 100 pages only because I bought the damn thing and felt like I HAD TO read it. I just couldn't read anymore, it was horrible. It's now collecting dust on a shelf, soon to be occupying the dumpster. I am typically against putting books into the trash, but that's where this one belongs."
3,A Bit Much to be Truly Funny,"For sarcastic drivel by a witty female, I prefer reading Jen Lancaster. This author seems to be attempting to pack too many metaphors and humorous blurbs into a sentence. I often felt like we needed to take a breath and were losing the point. End the sentence already. Less is sometimes more, especially when trying to make me chuckle. The many references to substance abuse were much in the style of Amy Sedaris. If you like that kind of thing."
3,Loses steam midway,"Her ability to exaggerate and twist mediocre events is hilarious. She's a smart-ass and she knows it. But, ""I Love Everybody"" loses steam midway and the last half is forced and trys too hard to entertain. Of the most unappealling aspects to Notaro's unenlightened writing is her thinly-veiled contempt for Arizona's Hispanic community."
4,Great for women in their 20's and 30's,"I got this book because I got one of those e-mails from Amazon.com, saying, ""Since you like David Sedaris, you'll like Laurie Notaro,"" or something to that effect. So I picked up this book based on that e-mail and the stellar reviews written here.Notaro shoots for her target audience, women in their late 20's to late 30's, and scores big time. If you fall into that demographic, you will love it. I, however, am a MAN. So I had a hard time relating to this stuff. I really gave it a chance though. It's not bad at all, it's just not for me.Comparing her to Sedaris is unfair, she has a completely different style. Yes, they both write funny non-fiction memoir stuff, but they're so different I wouldn't even know where to begin.So guys, buy this one for your wife or girlfriend, but don't think you're going to crack up laughing along with the ladies."
2,No Comparison to Idiot Girls Adventure Club,Trying way to hard to come off as hilarious. Here's a hint Laurie: the harder you try the less humorous you & your stories appear it's that simple. NEXT!
1,Stale,"Nothing in this book is fresh; it's all been done before and I believe it was in a comic strip called ""Cathy"". Each chapter is like every rant I've ever read (twice) in an email or on Craigslist, strung together with a few poo poo words for humor. It doesn't even have characters, just recycled and all-too-familiar aspects of a working woman's life: the editor who cannot write, the manager who just had a baby, the struggle between career and family, a crazy mother, a new age friend."
3,"A Good Book, but Not a Page Turner","I liked this book but did not find myself looking forward to sitting down at night and reading it. It was a book I could read a chapter or two, then put it down for several days and pick it up again. Sometimes I like that quality in a book. I have not read her other books. I am not sure if it's a case of ""if you've read one of them, you've read them all"". So I am holding off on buying any other books by this author."
4,Hilarious,"This was the first of Laurie's books I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I frequently laughed out loud, and had to read passages to my husband to explain why I had been laughing. We found many things funny because we had been through some similar situations (the crazy boss, the ghetto-fabulous neighborhood)I wish Laurie all the best in her literary career!!! I'm a huge fan of hers, and I""m on the prowl for her other books."
3,It was an ok book,"This was an ok read for me, yes some of the stories were funny but not most or even half of them were for me. I was hoping for a lot more from this book from the reviews it has gotten but I was a bit let down and found myself putting it aside a lot to read something else for awhile."
3,Light quick read,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I wanted a good laugh and a quick read. It's exactly what I got from it. It was a bit too predictable, but had its moments that did make me laugh."
4,Hilarious til the middle,"This book was so funny in the first few pages I could read on Amazon that I bought it. The first few chapters were laugh out loud, crying funny. But...towards the middle I started to think she was mean. I know, I know. She is open about that from the beginning. But instead of being funny, it was a turn off. Petty. I would read it again but the first half is way better than the second half."
3,"Great bargain, unless you're over 5' 11""","THis pack seems pretty durable and matches the description. I took it on a two day hike on the appalachian. However, on the way home, I went to REI to buy a real pack. You get what you pay for. This pack is not suitable for anyone 5' 11"" or taller. It was terribly uncomfortable for me at 6' 1"" and its short and sits rather low. I think the capacity is overstated also. I couldnt even fit the tent poles vertically in the pack. It didn't show signs of stress or tearing when I crammed 30lbs into it, just couln't organize to be comfortable. If I was only carrying a sleeping bag, clothes and soft, light items, It would suffice. If you are doing anything overnight or more than 5 miles, buy a name brand pack (Osprey, Gregory, Kelty, etc). I put more weight in an Osprey at REI and was amazingly more comfortable and nimble.This pack got me through the hike, but I am selling it ASAP."
2,poor quality,"Although the pack looks OK at first glance, a seam at the top ripped the first time I used it....I'm returning it."
2,Good price but cheap quality,"Similar to the other reviewer, my seams ripped the first time i used it. I don't like top loading as well, but it seems pretty common. Would avoid and spend an extra $20 and get something else.It does fit into carry on regulations, however."
3,"Reasonably Good Book, Not the Clearest","This book does go well beyond the manual, but in one critical area fails. When reviewing editing techniques -- the most valuable, practical information in the book -- the writer skips certain steps that are critical to the approach he is explaining. I found myself reading the first and last thirds of the book, which are quite helpful, and abandoning the middle third on actual editing techniques. For those familiar with the Meyers' book on After Effects, this is nothing even close. If only we could get them to write one on Premiere!"
5,Amazing cd player!,This CD player is my first Onkyo equipment. Amazing! The best that i've heard. I'm very impresssioned by the extreme quality of the sound. Congratulations to Onkyo!
5,"Solid Value (And It Looks Good, Too!)","I know that CD players are kind of a forgotten product category these days, what with DVD players that do CD, and the growing popularity of server-based music systems. But if you have a two-channel audio-only system in your home, and want a great-sounding CD player that won't break your bank account, I don't know how you could beat this Onkyo. True, it's front fascia isn't half an inch thick, and it's chassis isn't milled from a solid chunk of billet aluminum, but it is well-made and sounds great. By the way, it actually does have an aluminum front panel...and a full-featured remote control, plus a good sounding, volume-controlled headphone output. But mainly, it just plays CD's real well and is quiet in operation and reliable. What more could you really want?"
4,Perfect Bedtime Reading,"I tried to limit myself to one chapter per night; I wanted to savor this one. I don't ordinarily read a lot of mysteries, but the ghost twist pulled me in. There aren't many first-person ghost novels out there, and I was really looking forward to reading this one - and it didn't disappoint me. It was also a different sort of twist, with different ""rules"" applying to this particular ghost, all of which contributed well to the story."
2,not what xpected,"the straps are unevenly sown (one is higher that the other) making for uneven adjustment points, yes i get technical but this is suppose to be Jansport! Also the straps get loosened too easily. I dont like it but gonna have to deal with it."
5,very nice,this backpack is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute i bought this to use for a diaper bag on the simple fact it nicer looking than the old diaper bag the hospital gave me and is of better quality
2,Returned!,"This backpack was way too big on me for being a smaller girl and wasn't comfy whatsoever. It just looked and felt awkward. It does carry a lot of things but I didn't like it and sent it back. It was pretty true to color, just not the one for me."
4,Fantastic Pack,"I tested the water resistance in my sink. It is pretty good. I take it out in the rain with no hesitation. The Playground color scheme is very bright and I feel safe on my bike. The straps are soft, there is enough space for about 4 textbooks and a notebook in the main compartment."
5,Excellent,"I bought this backpack to replace my old one that I used for school. My old backpack had very little structure and it felt like my backpack would stick out three feet behind me when I had hardly anything in it! This backpack holds what other customers have said AND it doesn't cause a lot of bulk. Straps keep the backpack snug on your back. Very nice. I bought the teal and lime green backpack and the colors were TRUE to the image online. Overall, I am very, very pleased."
2,Don't make'em like they used to! It's a pain in the neck!!!,"The straps on this backpack are too wide (almost twice as wide as my old COMFORTABLE Jansport) and cut weirdly into my neck/shoulder. Without even putting anything in this backpack it hurt me to have it on (I guess it hit a weird pressure point in my neck or something). From reading other people's review it must be a great backpack to some people, but to me it was awful. Sure, it looks cool, but I'd much rather be comfortable than cool. Also it seems to be much more cheaply constructed than my old Jansport. I bought one in 1998, and the material just seems thicker than that of the new Jansports. Also, the zippers on this pack seem to catch the inner lip easily (A problem I didn't have with my old Jansport). Because of all of this I'm returning my backpack and looking for a new one AGAIN."
2,Barn Red is Orange-Red,"I have always had great experiences with JanSport, but not with this bag. Yes, there is a lot of space, but i find myself digging into the pockets just to get my cell phone or my ipod out for my daily commute. I also love red backpacks, and I loved how vibrant the color was on the Amazon page. I was extremely dissapointed when the bag arrived and it was more orange than red. The straps are also rubbing up against my neck and the plastic clips that hold the straps in place are to easy to adjust. Meaning, if i hit them by accident when taking off the backpack it messes up the settings. My old JanSport was also made of thick, durable fabric, this is like waterproof, windbreaker material with annoying zippers."
4,Wow! What a color!,"This backpack looks great and looks like it will hold a ton. However, I ordered the cabesa blue bag and it is pictured darker than its true color. It is really almost like a turquoise--a little too bright for me. I also thought it had a laptop area, but I must have got it confused with something else because it doesn't. It's just a good ole backpack with a cool pocket on top and a nice mesh bottle holder on the outer side."
1,Misleading,Don't buy this thinking you are getting a remake or re-release of Halodrol-50. Your not. This is bunk.
4,Goodbuy,"The case turned out to be a good bit less rigid than I expected, but it does indeed protect your rods quite well. Most similar cases are hell of expensive, so the price on this one was quite nice. I would not recommend it for anyone that does not own a pickup truck, though. Seven feet in practice is a little longer than most would expect. However, if you don't mind a good three or four feet taking up shifting/parking brake/console/cupholder space in the front of your car or SUV, you can probably make it work pretty well between the front seats. The material is surprisingly high quality and, along with the colors, give the case a quite elegant appearance. Most people that see the case expect a high-dollar rod to some out of it.Also, as goofy and ""As Seen On TV"" as The Sportsman's Guide company is, they ship quickly and have great prices on a wide selection of odd items that you would otherwise have trouble finding (like, for instance, a seven-foot case to hold two rod/reel combos)."
5,Brings Back Memories,"My father took me to see this movie when I was about 10 or so. He - an engineer - was interested in the technology and also the sailing ships. By today's standards it probably is a bit lame, but I enjoyed it. Strangely, as the movie ran, I found I remembered every scene and every line, so it must have made a big impression on me.I would recommend to baby boomers who like ""tall ships"" and handsome young men."
3,Does not compare to the original recording,"This movie is very dated. It was wonderful when it first premiere in Cinerama. It's supposed to be a documentary but the shots are clearly staged. Good as a review of the history of movie making technology, but that is about it."
4,Windjammer more than 50 years later,"My brother Jon took part as one of the maine cadets in this film. And I took a lot of pictures from the production period and the opening night in Oslo more than 50 years ago. Very interesting to see how times has changed since then, and how an outstanding technical achievement and courage the crew demonstrated at the time."
1,"javascript by example, an example of a misnomer",I got this book to learn javascript and for examples. After reading thru it a few times I found that it didnt do either. There was an entire chapter dedicated to HTML though. what a waste. This is the LAST time I am buying a book from QUE!
2,Does not fit,"This kit does not fit on my 3/8"" ID hose. The outside part that slips over the hose has too small of a diameter to fit the 3/8"" hose I am using. I suspect this will work only on single ply rubber hose. I am using a 2 ply, higher end, hose - and it will not fit over it. It is not even close. The product specifications need to include OD (outside diameter) hose information, not just ID (inside diameter) so that you can tell whether it will fit your hose before you order.If the description was accurate(which is not provided even on Stanley website), I would give it 3 stars (it's ok) because of price. Although it may work as advertised, a standard barb to NPT fitting runs about 70 cents. The price of ~$10 for a product that's not even universal is too high to warrant a better rating."
3,I really wanted to like this game!,"I love Ravensburger games. They are so well-made. When I opened the box, I was excited because there were several ways to play. I have a 4 1/2 year old and a 3 year old. Both have had language delays (although there is nothing delayed about my oldest's speech anymore), so I am always looking for games with pictures to describe and talk about. After beginning with one of the mid-range of difficulty games with both boys, they whizzed through, so I tried the most difficult after that. It was fun the first time, but a little ho-hum after that. My little guy will probably play a few more times and learn from it, but this is not going to last us until the age of 8. I am disappointed, because it's such a cute idea. I had hoped that there would be more ways to configure the houses, or more choices for rooms."
1,Forget buying a subscription if you're in the US,"While this magazine is a high quality periodical about military aviation, getting a subscription of this UK magazine to be delivered to a US address was impossible. I put in a subscription in September 2010, and I never got a single subscription. despite 5 months of waiting. This is despite three separate, fruitless phone calls to the US vendor handling subscription requests from US residents. I suggest that you spare yourself the inconvenience and forget the idea of taking a subscription if you are in the US."
3,reasonable,"I had read negative reviews when I bought this book, but was pleasantly surprised to find nothing unreasonable in it. The history consists of some conjecture, but nothing that isn't supported by far older historians. The claims to the contrary are not any better. After all, all histories have some guesswork. The doctrine set forth is questionable, but the history is OK."
5,Hypothyroidism: The Unsuspected Killer,This book was extremely informative about a disease that is rampant in our country that the medical profession overlooks. We can be healthy with a small dose of medication to make a huge change in the way we feel.
3,"A useful, though incomplete sourcebook.","I imagine this book was ground-breaking in it's time. Broda is clearly an perserverant and impassioned researcher. I appreciated the validating narratives describing various individuals dealing with thyroid dyfuntion. While the book deals extensively with the various symptoms less commomly associated with thyroid dyfunction, it failed to adequately cover the various kinds and causes of dyfunction."
1,COMPLETELY OUTDATED AND USELESS!!,"This book is over 22 years old & the books the author bases it on are 35 years old! Medical science has made major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during this time. Seven years ago, I was diagnosed with this disorder. I am under the care of an endocrinologist and my blood work shows my thyroid medication is working. However, I still have trouble losing weight and have dry skin and hair. I thought perhaps this book could help, especially after reading the rave reviews it was given. It was a big disappoint to say the least. In fact, the standard test used to detect hypothyroidism, which measures a person's TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, secreted by the pituitary gland) isn't even mentioned, nor is the most popular thyroid medication, Synthroid. There's nothing less of value than an out-of-date medical book!"
5,Fantastic books which needs to be better known,"This is a fantastic book which eradicates the mystery behind many different conditions. I read the 1-2 star reviews and I can see how narrow people think narrowly. You can't think narrowly and read this book. It also helps to have read other books on health and nutrition. I can't say the thyroid is the end-all to every physical problem but one thing for sure, it is often overlooked and not very understood by modern medical doctors. Sorry, they just don't get it."
5,Fast Shipping,"Got here right away, went a little overboard on the packaging, but thats ok since I could re-use it. Pleasure dealing with them, would do it again in the future!"
2,He is basically a gigolo....,"I picked this up at the library on the hope that it would be entertaining. It is for about the first 30 pages and then one starts to wonder - why does this poor man have no self respect? In his early days, the pictures in the book reveal an extremely attractive man and so it is hard to figure out why he basically lets himself become a gigolo to old rich women. There are also a few details I just did NOT want to know... such as him being surprised at enjoying oral stimulation from an 80 year old woman who wore dentures (note - he is about 30 at the time). Yuck! I would be embarassed if I were him but then, he does not seem to embarass easily if it will enrich him. It is also written in a ""tabloid"" style which gets mindless and repetitive after a while. I guess even Allan Starkie and his ""PhD"" could not improve the writing."
5,Royal Rumble 1994,"The '94 edition of the ""Royal Rumble"" was full of surprises. It saw Owen turn on his brother, Bret. We also saw the burial of The Undertaker as he was attacked by pretty much every heel in the building. We also got the controversial two-way tie ending that resulted in a double main event at ""Wrestlemania X"".The thirty-man ""Royal Rumble"" match featured such superstars as Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Lex Luger, Crush, The Steiner Brothers, Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, and more. This was one of the best Rumble matches.This event also saw the return of ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase as he took over color commentary duty for the departed Bobby Heenan, who had recently left for WCW. God, I wish the WWE would invest in releasing the Royal Rumble library."
5,it was awesome the best royal rumble ever you gotta see it,you got to see it for yourself it was the best ppv ever buy it now if you could find it.
4,Seymour Duncan Hot Rail Bridge,This pickup does not sound as strong as the neck Hot Rail and not full enough for me. I would it to be stronger than bridge. Now I will have to replace it with a full size humbucker again. I was not satisfied with the bridge hot rail. Amazon was very good with the shipping and tracking. I was thinking of putting the neck hot rail in the bridge location . I also bought Vintage Rail and neck hot rail. The neck Hot Rail was the only one that I really liked. If I were to do again I would put a neck Hot Rail in the middle instead of the Vintage and a JB jr in the bridge.
5,Planned Destruction of AMerica..J.W. Wardner,This should be used as a textbook in college!! Wardner's statements are well documented and will keep the reader frozen to it's pages..Statements written in early 90's are very much alive in 2009!! HIGHLY recommend reading more than ONCE!!!
5,scarier than fiction,the book was written in 1993 and clearly plans of world control are becoming more evident. inflation and media corruption are quite clear. this book is not out of date. excellent and convincincing book. would like to read more from the author.
3,A true workhorse with a fatal flaw,"I have had this printer and used it in a home office for three years. It's a great machine. The replacement cartridges are EXPENSIVE but the printer has really performed well. Recently, it got a carousel misalignment problem, and that will cost more than the printer to fix. Look online for ""carousel misalignment"" on this model, and you'll see that the printers easily become misaligned and the fix for the problem is expensive. It's too bad. I would not buy another one for this reason. There must be something better, more reliable, fewer things that can break (and cheaper toner, I hope)."
2,Bad battery,The battery of my phone died after 3 months of use. Technical service is most unhelpful.
2,"steer clear, unless you really need it","pros:1) it does work for calling -- skype-skype, skype-in, and skype-out -- with good sound quality2) has a (just ok) speakerphone3) reasonably portable -- slightly bigger than most ""candybar"" cell phones4) contacts get imported automatically, and they're easy to navigatecons:1) battery doesn't last a full day on standby2) the screen sometimes stays on until you turn the phone off (doesn't help con #1)3) even when con #2 doesn't happen, the device can get really hot against the ear4) doesn't work with the 2 standard earpieces i've tried5) doesn't offer conference call abilities6) doesn't offer any texting abilities, even skype's IMs, never mind SMS7) battery goes dead really fast when you wander off-network or to patchy public networkscertainly not a cell phone replacement, and not supposed to be.not bad if you want something, say, for use at home and work.if it's just for home use, probably better off with something else, or with vonage."
1,Not enough battery to be useful,"I am supremely dissapointed in this product. The battery life estimate was changed from 50 hours down to 20 hours between when I ordered it and when it finally shipped. I can't even get near that. I had intended to take the phone with me on the road, but it won't last an eight hour day unless I don't use it at all, and even then ten hours is as much as I can get out of it. I can get barely an hour of talk time, then it's dead. I feel like I have a phone that has to be constantly plugged in, and if that's the case I could tether a usb phone to my laptop for $hundreds less than I spent on this. If I had the opportunity, I would return it.Don't buy this. Wait for a better attempt from some other company..."
1,Not worth to get it,"I purchased 2 units of this products and return both units back to Netgear.First of all, netgear should carefully do a QC on this product before release in the market.1. This phone gets extremely hot after talking for more than 10 mins onwards.2. The battery life only last for 1 hour if you continue talking on the phone.I think may be the WI-FI chipset in this phone is giving the problem. It consumes all the batt life and the heat it generates.Wrote a complain email to Netgear. They still have no solutions to this issue.Not recommend to get this phone unless the problems listed is not your concern."
3,First Generation Phone,"This phone is a great idea, but not so nicelly implemented.- The battery life is very short (as many have commented);- The phone gets warm after 10 minutes of conversation;- The firmware is poor. Many times even the screen timeout doesn't work, living the lcd screen on and draining the battery;- The worst thing on it is that the phone can't connect any wifi network that has web-based login. So you will not be able to connect your phone in most shopping centers, airports, etc, even if it's free! This seems to be a simple fix in the firmware, but Netgear is beeing _very_ slow on enhancing it (they sure now how).If you do not really need an wifi skype phone now, better wait a second generation.3 stars just for the ideia."
1,Do not buy this item,"The call quality is so poor with this device, it is effectively useless. Do not buy it!"
1,Disappointing,"Am returning phone tomorrow. After 2 and a half hours on the phone with Netgear Customer Support (""level 2 technicians), I could not get the phone to recognize my Belkin Pre-n router at home (even after disabling security, changing channels, disabling pre-n mode). I went to Starbucks to try connecting there. Managed to get a signal but phone would not permit me to sign in to Skype - received same error msg about unrecognized numerical character in my Skype sign in name (there are no numerical characters in my sign-in name). Can't comment on call quality as I have not been able to sign in. How disappointing.Maybe Belkin will get it right with their Nov 06 release."
1,Don't Waste Your $,"It doesn't work at Starbucks or any coffee shops, it only works with your home, your friend's home, your work (if it has WiFi) & some hotels. Save your money & buy a $10 headset for your laptop."
2,Definitely not a recommended purchase,"At first glance, I though ""Wow! What a cool looking phone. It would match my iMac"". When I got it, it did indeed match the iMac- physically only. This product is full of bugs, random reboots, echoing in the mic, no warning when the battery is running dry, not to mention the 1.5 hours of talk time. I would only recommend this to someone who likes to spend a lot of money on useless items."
3,"No service from Boingo, YOU CANNOT USE THE PHONE","Thought I would drive this point home, even though is stated throughout the ad for the phone, indirectly as well as directly. You have to pay a fee of $8 a month, to use this phone on a BOINGO wireless network. It will NOT work on ANY wireless network.....JUST BOINGO. I neglected to read and reread the ad and thought I was getting a phone that worked on ALL wireless networks. No. Duh. My bad, dont let it be your bad. Best"
2,"Nice phone, but awful support and battery life","This phone is doing what it should. You can use skype without a computer. However, technical support is awful. I tried to reach them in an attempt to get the phone loudspeaker changed - no response in the end.The battery life is also to short and not beeing able to use it for messaging is a lack in the software.I would not buy it again."
4,Great product,I love this phone. User friendly. You get to talk with good quality for free with other phones like this or other people online. You can also do it for cents to landlines or cell phones around the world. The only problem is the battery life. But it's ok if u have the charger close.
1,Worst product.,"This is the worst product with the worst customer service. I had to call Netgear three times, on the phone with them for over 2 hours to explain them the product that I received is a defective one. After convincing them that the item is defective, I was given three choices: 1. pay little money for shipping to send the item back to them and expect a long waiting time for the new item to arrive. 2. pay some moderate amount for the new item to arrive first in a week. 3. pay ridiculous amount for the new item to arrive in few days. I asked them why I should pay for shipping for returning the defective item or getting a replacement, and they said it's their policy. After complaining this to Netgear's corporate office, they told me to call Amazon for the replacement.overall, not worth wasting time and money with this product."
1,Battery problem,Talk time less than 25 minutes and stand by time less than 1 hour.its so frustrating and annoying to use such a great product with such a stupid battery life.
4,For Skype Netgear phone,"I love Skype - and the hardware is ok. I've experienced some of the known bugs, but they seem to have work arounds. Ex. the forgetting connection bug - you have to go to ""preferred networks"" | options | connect - so you don't have to log in again.Phone has pretty good compression. I'm not sure if my computers has slightly better compression - or even if that's how it works. It works well for skype to phone (I got unlimited for 1 year for 14 USD) and EXCELLENT for skype to skype (I mean better than normal phone).BTW - there is NO chat capability - which the Amazon review used to say it had."
1,Good specs bad implementation,"Often reboots automatically.Logs off and back-on on its own.Ear-piece gets hot after 5 minutes of talk.Battery standby life is poor ( less than 7 hrs).Does not remember userid/pass on power-cycle.Does not keep the time well.Very poor Netgear support, its off-shored and they seem to not know much or have only a few technitian to support the device.Price of 150 is outrageous!Update : 5/2/07This phone has connection issues with USR5461 and some linksys APs.Works fine with Westall & ASUS APs."
3,Software Update Badly Needed,"For international calls, around the home and taking it to work it is much more convenient than using a laptop because of its small size and in-pocket mobility. However many skype users will communicate as much with instant messages as voice so its voice only limitation is a problem, especially if some buddies are located in countries where they need to pay for bandwidth used. This means you need to get a separate skype account perhaps with an name like JOHN SMITH (Voice Only) indicating to your buddies that they cannot text you on this secondary account. The process of authorization seems to rely on an old version of Skype - I had problems sending all my skype contacts to the new account and authorizing new contacts easily. The lack of software updates for this suggests that the manufacturer may have given up on this product as a flop. I hope I'm wrong because improved software would make a big difference to this handset."
2,Back to the past,"Am not sure if my expectations were simply too high (after waiting so long...) or the phone is just not good. But the conclusion is that I'm disappointed. Yes, sound quality is satisfying and it's compact, but other than that, there's just nothing above average. And in a tech-oriented world where iPod and Nokia are setting the standards for design and build quality, that's just not good enough. The SPH101 feels like a prototype put together in a hurry (probably was). It falls flat in many areas: The screen is tiny, battery life is a joke (16 min talk time!) and it gets too hot. Most importantly, however, it looses connection to the wireless network and and/or Skype every other day. Not certain if there's anything else to blame for (my Netgear router?) but anyway, this phone is going back."
2,"it does make skype calls, but pretty cheesy","incoming audio quality is reasonable enough.outgoing audio quality is lousy for most people I've talked to.Most ask me to please please go back to using the computer.My attempts at improving audio quality for people by plugging a headset into the 2.5 headset socket failed, because no sound comes out of the headphone, I've seen several other people about this, not sure if that feature is just dead on all phones or just a number of them.the backlighting for the keypad is really cheesy too, it fails to light both outer rows of keys properly.I have no complaints about battery life so far, nor does it bother me that I can't use hotspots outside of my house, because I use it instead of cordless phone at home. Out of the house I stick to my cellphone for skype purposes.The phone is nice and small, and it sits well in its charger.When its in the charger, the screen stays on, which is nice, doubles as a night light."
3,nice little phone,"This phone is a nice addidition to my skype. I like the portablity, and have not had a problem using it where an open wi-fi connection is available. The reception has been very good. The only complaint I have is that the battery runs down very quickly, and needs to be charged every day or more if used often. The talk time is probably less than 2 hours. I'm hoping that it will be good for overseas traveling."
1,More of a problem then a help,"I am a big Skype user and talk to family and friends via my computer with the cam and love it. I thought that I would get the Netgear Skype phone so that I could use it in Sydney and at home in my WiFi. The phone that I got is obviously defective. After 5 times with what netgear calls tech support. Actually, it sounded like it was a over crowded, dusty, hot room in India. I couldn't began to understand the tech. I was so tired of saying, ""pardon me."" I wanted to hang up. Long story short, finally the phone is going back and I am getting a replacement. However, I have to pay $16.90 for shipping for Netgears faulty product. My last wireless router from Netgear had a problem and I took it back. I just figured since Skype was behind this product, it would be better. I will not ever buy a Netgear product again. Beware of this item. I hope that the new one will work. We will see."
3,Skype Phone,I purchased this phone when my husband was working in Kuwait. It worked fairly well. Sometimes the calls drop and sometimes there is extra noise but I figured with the money I saved every phone call that did work was worth it. The unit does get overly hot to the touch after about 1 hour of usage. I guess for the technology that went into it - it was worth it to have. Probably is overpriced but what can you do if you really need to use one?
4,Nice Phone,This is a really nice phone. It is very easy to navigate its menu system and is comfortable to hold. I did have trouble getting it to connect to my Linksys SRX400 wireless router and never did get this problem resolved even after talking to Linksys and Netgear numerous times.I was able to get it to connect to my Linksys Wireless G router (WRT54GS).The battery life on this phone is short. This is to be expected for a Skype phone.Overall I liked the phone but I ended up sending it back to Amazon because of compatibility issues with my Linksys SRX-400.
1,This first Skype phone was before it's time.,"I got this in October as soon as it was released. It does what it claims to do but not very well. First problem is that the battery power is horrible. Maybe 4 or 5 hours max, so you have to leave it plugged in all the time. Then my contacts worked for a day or so but now it hasn't shown anyone in my contact list for 3 months. It must be corrupted but that doesn't keep the phone for preventing me from calling for 5 minutes everytime I start it because it is ""downloading contacts"". Also, I had patience when I got it but I can't figure out why Netgear hasn't put out new firmware to fix the plethora of issues with this phone. I paid $250 for this and expected some support."
1,problematic,"The battery would not hold a charge on the first phone that I ordered so I ordered a replacement. The replacement also had the same problem. The factory setting for the back light is set at one minute but remained on constantly, thus using up the battery in less than 8 hours. If the phone was used to make a call it went dead in a far shorter time. The idea of this product is a good one but this phone is not yet ready for consumer use. I cannot recommend another brand since Netgear SPH101 is the only one I've tried."
2,Bad Product,Is hard to connect in several wireless networks;Phone turn it off without reason even if is connect in the power adapter;
5,Winger is back!,"When I first heard 'Blue Suede Shoes' on the myspace page...I was excited. I just got the cd back in December and I'll admit, it wasn't an easy listen. But I'm one who usually has to let the music grow on me. Well, it only took a few more listens and then that was it! I love every track on here. I love the emotion and energy Kip sings in every song and the addition of Cenk is AMAZING!!! My favorites being 'Right Up Ahead', 'Blue Suede Shoes', 'Generica', 'Disappear', and 'Can't Take it Back'. I've always been a Winger fan from back in the day but this cd is definately one of my favorites along with Pull. I just saw Winger perform live last week and was VERY IMPRESSED with the performance of the new stuff and the crowd sure seemed to embrace it all. I look forward to the 'making of' dvd for this cd. Like I said...WINGER IS BACK!"
4,Great to see Winger still ROCKS!,One of the best 80s metal bands are back and better than ever! I just saw them on New Year's Eve live in Pittsburgh and they are amazing! Purchase the new CD....it's well worth your investment!
1,NOT EVEN A GOOD TRY!,"Winger are back with a CD un-originally called ""IV"". This is the worst attempt at a comeback i've ever heard. I've listened to Winger ever since 88' and saw them once in 90' but this is not even a shadow of that band long ago. I enjoyed the first three records alot but with this latest attempt they have lost the luster that got them that first record deal. Starting with the first track ""Right up ahead"" to it's painful end, not one track has any memorable substance. Save your money. Don't buy this CD."
3,Somewhat Disaapointed,"After many years hoping for a new Winger release, I was chomping at the bit when the announcment came. When I finally received it I played it numerous times hoping that the music would get better. While there are a couple of shining moments there are just a couple of songs that are OK. The rest I feel is sub par for one of my favorite rock bands of all time.It seems as if they have sacrificed the melodic continuity that kicked butt on the first 3 LP's for the experimental, alternative direction that IV has taken and that has disappointed me. The live shows in 2006 and 2007 are however Brilliant and I encourage anyone to experience Winger Live, just phenomanal !!"
1,Winger IV is a terrible comeback album!,"I tried to listen to this album which is mostly about the Iraq war that was happening at the time. I thought this was Winger, not Megadeth. Leave the politics to those bands. After 13 years since ""Pull"", I thought they would returned with a great album (check out Karma which was they released in 2009) but it didn't happen. The only song worth noting is ""4 Leaf Clover"", the rest you can skip. This is the only Winger I don't own anymore because it's that bad. Nothing catchy or melodic like the 1st three albums. Thanks for reading!"
4,Winger for a new decade,"When I heard they were putting out a new release I really didn't know what to expect, as its been 14 years since their last one. What I found is that this album contains a refreshing mix of the old and the new, both the heavier driving sound contained on the ""Pull"" album mixed with some of the more melodic catchy hooks contained on the first two releases. That being said this is definitely not an 80's or 90's album, as their sound has been updated to be more in line with today's fare.The best songs in my opinion are ""Four Leaf Clover"", ""Your Great Escape"", and ""Can't Take It Back"", all of which rank up there with the best Winger songs of the past. Outstanding musicianship abounds all through the album, with the only thing holding it back from a 5-star rating in my opinion are a couple of tunes which I listened to once and didn't have any interest in listening to again. Overall a solid comeback release and hopefully there will be more to come!"
1,Pseudo Spiritual Garbage from a disgusting individual,"Randall Radic...author, pastor, accomplished charlatan. Radic goes by the pseudonym Maximus Confessor. Hopefully he will be doing some Maximum Confessing before a judge when he goes to trial. Just google ""Radic"" and ""Fraud"" to discover that this author embezzled and forged to bilk his congregation out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling his church property out from under it's unknowing congregation. Radic should know plenty about ""today's plastic, consumer-oriented...world"" as he was able to drive his new, illegally purchased $100,000 BMW for a couple days before ending up in the slammer. I look forward to his follow up books ""Mystic Fraud"" and ""Bearing False Witness."" He's truly an expert on those topics. Maybe he can co-author the next two with Jim Baker. They'll let you have a pen and paper in prison, won't they?"
2,Alright but still disappointing,I first won tickets to the premiere re-release of this film in Toronto in 96 from a radio station but couldn't get to see it because I was only 16(restricted). I thought it would be a Pink Floyd The Wall type movie with awesome music and animation. But a lot of the movie was fairly boring. I'd stick with the soundtrack.
3,FLASHBACK,"I've had this on VHS for 20yrs. or so and I find it to be very entertaining both in the music and in the special effects and graphics. In its day it was beyond ""state of the art"" and today it is still worth watching. Excellent film. Especially for us 'BOOMERS' I find myself drawn to watch every two or three years."
2,Bland,To sell this product I think it is pertinent to send it with the cover. What makes this movie such a classic is the art work throughout. It is a little disappointing to recieve something that is missing the cover. Especially with a movie like Heavy Metal.
5,I love it!,"I enjoyed to watch, ""Heavy Metal"" because it brought me good memory when I was a kid. The little ball of magic I like it because I had it when I was a kid I used to play with it."
5,Awesome classic to find!,"You can't find a cult sci-fi fantacy flick just anywhere, and I about fell out of my chair when I could watch it anytime on my device."
5,Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition),"I had forgotten all about this movie! I was shopping for a copy of ""Wizards"" and found this. I saw it in the theater when it first was introduced. The DVD took me back - the sound and quality were beyond words! Several animated mini stories tied together with the mysterious evil green orb. The movie can best be summed with the unspoked phrase, ""Don't call me 'Bitch'."""
5,a female point of view,"In looking through the reviews, it seems most (if not all) were written by men, so allow me to add my point of view. I thought the movie was great, regardless of the violence (which I don't think is that much compared to other movies I've seen) and how well-endowed the women were drawn (a rather irrelevant point for me). I agree that it is dated, but as that same person pointed out, there really wasn't much else available in the early 80's. If you keep that in mind as you watch it, the movie's really not that bad. I've always enjoyed animated films and still do and this was the first one - or one of the first - that wasn't made with only kids in mind. I still enjoy watching it from time to time and probably always will."
4,heavy metal,"I remember going to the movies watching this in the 70's. I really enjoyed seeing it again, to me it's a cult classic. The animation didn't seem as amazing as the first time I saw it years ago, I guess I've become spoiled with the present. Great music cuts enhance this immensely."
5,heavy metal,"I never read any ""heavy metal"" mags, but this movie was a really good depiction of """"heavy"""". Action, humor, great animation, a plot that kept me interested, this movie had it all. I would highly recommend it. Greg, [...]"
5,Heavy Metal special edition,Heavy Metal is an excellent movie. And it's a great way to see the magazine come to life. It has great rock and Heavy Metal music along with it's motion picture score.It's a cult classic for Friday night viewing. Not to be missed and represents the 1980's at it's best.
3,Heavy Metal Memories,"The movie was not nearly as cool as I remembered, but it still brought back some great memories. It gave my adult children a laugh to see what interested me when I was a teenager. Apparently I have changed! The music on the copy that I bought was not as prominent as I recalled it was originally in the theater. I would buy it again."
1,Heavy Metal,I bought the new revamped dvd. It said it was better than the old one. Is that nought a horible thing to read. I loved the orignal and got this. It was terrible!!! The music is very low. The last one has always been the best. Such a beautiful woman to have to save the world. They changed her face to make her look like a man in drag. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Wasn't as good as I thought I remembered,"I had great memories of what a great soundtrack I thought this movie had. After purchasing it, I realize that the soundtrack was good but the sound quality isn't and the movie itself is plain bad."
2,Must have been out of my mind,"Thought this movie was entertaining when I saw it ages ago. I was hoping the blu ray would give a better picture, but I was wrong. Dont waste your money."
4,HEAVY METAL: TAKE A RIDE!,"Screenplay adaption of the cult sci-fi/fantasy magazine that bears its name. Splendid animation with an equally impressive accompanying soundtrack. A film which brings back many fond memories of my adolescence. Also be aware that the majority of VOICE actors in this film were comprised of SCTV ALUMNI!! e.g. EUGENE LEVY, JOHN CANDY, etc. This film is a must for those of you who grew up reading the magazine."
5,My dad introduced me to this movie,"He used to have this movie on VHS in the early '90s. I'm glad to own the movie on Blu-Ray. It has inspired me to buy the soundtrack, and listen to it on my next date with a girl. The music is as cool as Genesis and The Alan Parsons Project. The lady in the picture definitely is NOT Lady Gaga or Beyonce, and does not look or sound anything like her. The '80s are my generation and I find this Heavy Metal movie to be one of the most awesome movies ever. Too bad those animated Disney films are not anything like this. If you like the '80s and you are in the mood for an animated film for adults, this would be for you."
5,best movie in history,"Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition)This is an awsome movie,if you don't have itGet It!"
4,SUPERBIT VERSION of HEAVY METAL IS NO-FRILLS,"HEAVY METAL is not a great film, nor a bad one, it's more like an old hippie friend who lives down the street; some days you couldn't care less, but there are times when you need to be in that ""aura."" I wouldn't call myself a fan, but saw it opening weekend when it was released, I have had it in three formats, and probably watched in 30 times or so. Each time I find something new.I bought the Superbit version, and while I don't have a HD or plasma screen to notice any major difference in the picture quality, the sound is amazing; it's loud and CLEAR, with a really nice EQ job (and I am using Dolby surround, not DTS). The down side is that there are NO extras, aside from subtitles. I especially miss that pen drawn outtake that was on the videotape and laserdisc version (this is the first DVD of HEAVY METAL that I have owned). If all you care about is the movie, the Superbit is a great presentation, for all the extras, look for different versions."
4,Just what you expect,"Heavy Metal is just what you expect. A Blast from the Past. A Classic. No DVD collection should be without it, hence, my purchase. Had to watch the day I got it. Worth it for the music."
5,Heavy Metal - Totally Cool Flick!,"I viewed this movie back when it first came out; it was a double feature opening for Pink Floyd's The Wall. I was so psyched when I saw these films. Heavy Metal was the first ""hi-tech"" cartoon movie that had (still has) an awesome soundtrack. I have seen it twice since Xmas 2006 and love this movie. Great party flick for all ages, great date flick, great for just mellowing out to some great entertainment. Some great tunes within, buy it just for that!Much better flick if you have a good to great sound system to hear it on and you've got to turn off the lights to get its full effects.Buy it and add to your collection - you won't be disappointed."
1,Pathetic animation and very weak plot lines,"When on cable this movie gets a two star review in its synopsis. It, however, deserves even less. The animation is lousy and the plot lines throughout the film are so simple and ridiculous. I can't believe how stupid some of them were. It is a film that definetly does not stand the test of time. Don't buy it, watch it on cable and be disappointed that way. The animation is a half step above the attrocious work ushered into America by those assassins of the art Hanna and Barbera. It's a baaaaaadddd movie."
1,You can do much better than this!,"Brutally awful film that takes delight in poor taste and sadistic treatment of it's characters. Hardly groundbreaking, animation is ugly and cheap looking. There is nothing redeeming about this film and you can do a lot better."
3,Unimpressed with special features,"The surround sound is excellent. The deleted scene is bad. The commentaries sound like someone reading a textbook, very boring after 2 minutes. I was dissapointed in the extra feautures but if you enjoy the movie and have a good surround sound system, then get it."
2,Mao's escape from Chiang Kai-shek.,"A simplistic book about the 8,000 mile march by Mao and the Communists to escape the clutches of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists. This book was written for young people, but the book is too simplistic. If you read the book, you would believe that Mao was a hero, rather than a bloody dictator. I hope those who read this book also read something about the crimes Mao committed in the course of his career.This book is not critical enough of Mao. Edmonds seems charmed by Mao. I hope readers are not."
5,A fine pictorial guide to the ancient near east,"Picture books are often helpful for understanding and bringing subjects to life, and this one is no exception. The stories from the Bible come alive with this imagery, and this book is helpful to children and adults alike."
4,Brief yet informative biography of Mexican martyr,"Blessed Miguel's life was, tragically, very short, thereby leaving a dearth of information for biographers and promoters of the cause for Miguel's canonization. What information exists, however, is shaped by Ann Ball into a well-rounded portrait the Mexican priest who, though not all of his actions may be considered ""saintly"", is one of the best-known figures in the history of Church persecution in Mexico.Ann Ball's book is short, yet very informative and entertaining -- it is difficult not to smile when reading the anecdotes of Blessed Miguel's deceptions of the police persuing him and other religious, yet a few pages later reading of his eventual martyrdom strikes a sad chord. This is recommended reading for anyone interested in studying modern persecution of the Catholic Church."
4,Now for something completely different,"This group knocked my socks off when I heard it on XM radio. So I bought the CD, obviously. Well, uh, hmmm, to be honest.... only the 1st and last tracks really stayed with me. They expressed an original viewpoint and I found them almost haunting in their beauty."
2,Burnt Plastic Smell,I wasn't going to write about this product but I saw another reviewer mention the electrical or burnt plastic/rubber smell. I noticed that as well and wanted to inform potential customers about this issue.I originally purchased this from a nearby store for a good price. The glass jar was large and sturdy. The based of this glass fit in nicely to the motor so there's no worry about slippage or such.We made two smoothies with this machine and it broke large ice cubes with no problem. The drinks were consistent and well blended.The major issue we had was the electrical smell. It happened the first time we used it as well as the second time. I didn't think this is regular at all and rather than take a risk of it breaking down or causing a fire I returned it from where I purchased it.
2,Same burning smell for me too,"Wow, sounds just like my experience. It blended very well, making a very nice smoothie with no ice chunkks. HOWEVER, I also got that burning smell like the motor was burning up or something, so I took it back today."
2,"Funky smell, low capacity","The gasket that seals the blade base to the pitcher absorbs odors very easily. I pureed soup in this once, and cannot get the smell out of it. It appears that most all Hamilton Beach and Proctor Silex blenders use the same blade base (except one model, per Hamilton Beach's Web site), so this problem is not unique to this particular model. These consumer models are not NSF-certified (per NSF International's certified products database), nor do I expect that they would be certifiable given their odor-absorbing quality.The picture for this particular model is also misleading... there is no way this blender could blend a drink when its pitcher is that full."
1,Crap blender,"Had this blender 4 years, during which I maybe used it 20 times until one day it stopped working- looks like some of the plastic underneath the blades melted. What a piece of junk!"
3,Not very impressive,"I was not very impressed by this dvd. The quality is poor. The story is meager. But on the bright side: it gives a decent impression of ballet issues. Since I live in Holland and bought the dvd for my 10 years old cousin, it's a good thing that there is not much conversation going on in the film."
3,"Good, basic info. on five element acupuncture practice","There's surprisingly little info. ""out there"" about five element acupuncture, first taught by J.R. Worsley, originally of the U.K. This book provides some of the only written info. you'll find, and because of that, is fairly helpful. If more were written, this book might seem kind of basic/generic, but there's an absolute paucity of available info., so it's actually very helpful, by default. The author studied with J.R. Worsley in England, and breaks down what the five elements are like re: health and treatment through this unusual, rare form of acupuncture."
3,"If you buy the KINDLE edition, check it ASAP!","If you buy the KINDLE edition make sure to check it right away. When I bought it there was a big white blank stripe going across 25% of most of the pages eliminating parts of paragraphs, words, pics, etc. It's hard to tell with just the paragraphs so look for pages with pictures and diagrams to make sure they've rescanned and corrected the issue.Otherwise, you're better off with a cheap material copy."
1,Great book but format of the print is poor,The content is very good but the electronic format was poor in quality and somewhat difficult to read on the iPad.
2,"Very basic, a bit disappointing","I had great expectations from the book, but was a bit disappointed when I read it. Although the book covers in great detail the five elements and their characteristics, there is very little information on applying to real cases in terms of identifying the relevant acu points on the body for treatment. This might be an OK book for real beginners, but even for that there are much better books. Overall, a let down for me."
3,Extreme Makeover,"Vol. 1 of Tomoko Hayakawa's manga series follows 4 handsome young men who get to bunk together in a tricked-out mansion rent-free, under the condition that they transform a frizzy-haired, light-sensitive, horror-movie loving recluse into an elegant young lady. The task is easier said than done, but it may actually easier to do than reading this comic. For some reason the art and paneling make the story so hard to follow, you even miss the characters' names. Reading ""Wallflower"" feels more like a chore than a leisure activity. I thought I got the hang of shojo manga by now, but after this experience (resulting in this half-hearted review), it looks like this genre is just not my cup of tea (and I like tea).This comic is rated OT (Ages 16+): Violence, Adult Language."
5,HILARIOUS,This manga really made me laugh so hard. I keep reading it over and over again. I can never get enough of it. I can't wait to get the second volume.
5,Excellent Manga/Storyline,"The real title roughly translated is Perfect Girl Evolution but they changed that for some reason to Wallflower, have no clue why?! But despite the title change I was also shocked to see that they did a great job translating this manga and I was afraid at first that they would mutilate this manga like some other companies have done before but i'm glad I was wrong. This series is worth reading just becuase as others have stated its unique in its storyline and character development. Especialy the freaky zombie loving girl! I give this series 5 stars and hope people check it out at your local bookstore if you want to get a preview read with Volume 1."
3,it's ok...,"It's ok. It is well made and there is nothing that wrong with it, but I like my sandbags on the softer side. Also, I have seen bags in yoga studios more ergonomically designed to fit the body better."
4,A True Hero,"Anyone, who's never heard of Bonhoeffer, can read this book and receive a wonderful introduction to a true hero. It's clear and simple enough to give to a young teenager, but also factual enough and inviting enough for any age.Ms. Raum has taken a complex subject and hero and made them both available to anyone who wants to explore how Christians responded during World War II in Germany."
3,One of Lawrence Welk's earliest albums,"I still recall when I first saw this album. My parents were huge fans of Lawrence Welk's TV show, and growing up several of his early-1960's albums were very popular with me as well. (In fact, I always preferred his records over the show!) And Welk looked awful YOUNG on the cover photo! Turns out this was his 2nd album, right after POLKA AND WALTZ TIME (anyone more knowledgeable please correct me if I'm wrong here). As always, Welk's band gives a light and bouncy touch to any song they do, including a very different take of ""Stompin' At The Savoy"" from others I've heard.I only recently noticed something slightly odd about this CD. It's missing 4 of the songs the LP had-- but includes 2 at the end that were not on the original. Considering how much you can fit on a CD, I'd say someone should correct this some day, as the LP has the slight ""edge""-- if yours hasn't been scratched up from being played to death over the decades!"
3,Good purchase.,The wire is a pretty thick gauge and I don't think I really used it well (I broke some branches using it). But that was my own mistake. The wire is pretty good.
4,"Disappointed, but still good","I bought all 3 CD's at once, having only heard Right Now Right Now before and had high hopes. Something changed in this one. They end was really preachy which is not at all the George I've grown to love. He is usually successful at supporting Hispanics without pushing anyone else down. This one felt kind of anti-white (or anyone else) at the end. It's still a good CD, but after loving the other 2 so much the bar was set kind of high and this one didn't make it. If you're choosing between them get one of the other ones, if you want all things George Lopez then this should be in your collection."
2,Not too funny...,"George isn't near as funny as he was on Team Leader, America's Mexican, and Why you cryin DVD. It is the same dysfunctional latino topics but this time not too funny."
5,It puts the GPS where you want you can see it easily...,"I have an off road vehicle I use to go exploring the hundreds of Forest Service and logging roads near here and I needed a way to be able to see, on the GPS my preplanned route easily since at times I am using both hands either for steering or shifting or both. This vehicle mounting bracket is the perfect solution. I can mount it on the inside of the windshield and position it so that I always have a clear view of the display. It is well made and offers a great deal of flexibility to position the GPS display just where you want it. A perfect solution and a great buy...I hardily recommend this accessory."
4,Investing for Dummies,"This is a clear and concise book for people like myself who are starting to look closely at investing and it gives very good advice and assumes that the reader has no knowledge of investing (true in my case). It warns of the pitfalls as well and can be read straight thru, or by any chapter that you wish to know more about. I would recommend this book to the beginner."
4,Investing for Dummies,"I bought this for my daughter, who is taking this a college course.She seems to be happy with it. She asked for this book it as the instructor told her she needed it for the class. Sorry I can't give you more info but I am sure it's a good book.Kathy in Las Vegas"
2,FUNNY!,"I loved this comedy series. They should make as many seasons as possible. The actress that plays the main character is so funny, she should do stand up. LOVE THIS. ACTING AND WRITING ARE TOP NOTCH!"
2,Overrated,"I'm an expat living in Europe and bought this b/c the TV [stinks] over here and the recommendations were so high...however, this is really quite stupid...i'm a huge fan of the Simpsons, The Man Show, and the like, but this just doesnt even come close."
4,46 years and still counting,"The first season DVD of Strangers with Candy finds Amy Sedaris and company starting to flesh out these self-involved characters who are interested in one thing: immediate gratification at any cost. One of the darkest and funniest shows ever to come to television, Strangers with Candy is actually an important show because it is fearless. These writers were not thinking about how they could make the most money off of their show; they were interested in creating art for the sake of art. No wonder it only lasted for three seasons.A wonderful series, although the first season has as many misses as hits. The second and third season were more consistent. The commentaries on this box are interesting though."
5,Separate your friends from acquaintances,"Strangers with Candy is a brutal look at high school, guaranteed to offend every group of people. It's not for kids, and it's not for the faint-hearted. I will lend this to a casual friends and co-workers and wait for their reaction. I know if they return it with tight-lipped courtesy that our friendship is destined to stay casual. If they love it or hate it, I know I may have found a new best friend."
1,"Great Show, Unfair DVD Distributor","I love this show, but I give it ONE STAR because they left out English Subtitles/Captioning for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing. This makes me, one of the biggest fans of the show, not part of the fun of having a DVD collection of my number one favorite TV series ever.:)"
5,Comedy Central,"You guys all know that the entirety of this show is FREE on comedycentral.com, right??? But, hey, it's your choice if you want to pay for every episode."
1,Horrid,"Show is for intellectual losers and misfits. If you find humor in parents grieving over the death of their high school daughter and a baby being bounced off a dresser, Enjoy this ""show."""
4,The Drapes Match the Shoes,"This series is tonic for the plethora of sickening sweet homogeneous ABC Family-style sitcoms clogging the airwaves today. If you haven't met Jerri Blank, her family, friends and teachers, your reaction will range from shock to the kind of guffaws that force you to hit pause so you can catch your breath. There's no getting around it: each episode demands multiple viewings. The season gets funnier and it's clear the writing, acting and directing is consistently inspired and hilarious. You know Amy and her pals are having a blast at every step. I love this show and I want Amy Sedaris to have my baby."
2,ZAPPED FINALLY!,"I couldn't believe that ZAPPED was finally released on DVD. I remember watching this film over millions of time on HBO when I was younger. Heather Thomas was a babe. I recall giving this film an A+. I'm over the fact that the film is A+ material, but it worth watching again for the memories of the innocent 80's where nudity ruled."
3,Cheesy but totally irresistible,"If you want to be easily amused with a movie that does not demand anything from you but your time, this movie will deliver that for you. Check your brain at the door and enjoy the good spirits."
4,Smutty fun,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid. While it does not fall into the harrowed halls of other 80s teen flicks (Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, etc.) - most of which one is so sick of viewing that you wish they would be retired but that's another review - it survived because of its smutty and hilarious goings on. There is a loose plot, a lot of nudity, and a general good time that only could come from the mind of pubescent boy.Scott Baio, later teen heartthrob of Charles In Charge, is an awkward, nerdy teen named Barney who, after a lab experiment gone wrong, suddenly has telekinetic powers. Instead of his equally awkward counterpart, Carrie, who avenges her bullies and burns down the whole school, Barney uses his unusual powers in a more positive revenge light. Filled with Heather Thomas's cleavage shots and other slapstick antics, Barney finds that the world is his oyster.Enjoy it for some silliness for the sake of silliness."
5,zapped,"Zapped,is about a boy that gets powers and uses them to getwhat he wants its a great teenage movie My kids loved it .V Nall"
3,How Come The Stupid Sequel is On DVD And Not The Original Movie!,"I first watched the movie Zapped on cable, I think it was on one of those movie channels like HBO or Cinemax and I liked this movie and thought Scott Baio and Willie Aames were very good in it and I think this movie should be put on DVD! I have the movie on video but since videos wear out easily it would be so much better to have this movie on DVD! I just can't believe that the stupid sequel is on DVD but not the original which is amuch better movie! 3 1/2 stars!"
3,Weird Science,"High school science nerd Scott Baio develops telekinetic powers after mixing marijuana and plant food. He and buddy Willie Aames scheme to use it while gambling, playing baseball, and opening blouses...not necessarily in that order. Actually pretty funny (those who don't care for this sort of thing might want to pass) with a great supporting cast: Stuffy Robert Mandan as the principal, Sue Ann Langdon as a horny teacher, Heather Thomas as the snotty blonde bombshell, and Scatman Crothers is hilarious as the custodian. Baio's parents are particularly funny. Mindless fun for the ""Porky's"" and ""Ridgemont High"" crowd."
3,FAST TIME AT RIDGEMONT HIGH MEETS CARRIE,A very interesting movie...funny at parts with strong supporting performances from Felice Schatcher (who played Nancy on the Facts of Life's first season) and buxom Heather Thomas (who looks too OLD and well developed to be a high schooler). Scott Baio developed telekinetic powers and mainly to use it for personal gains. The ending of the film borrowed heavily from the film Carrie...but with a twist of course! Clothes started coming off everyone in the prom with interesting results. Watching the final scenes you get the impression that teenage girls DO NOT wear bras and that guys wear red bikini briefs with the Rolling Stone's lips logo on the crotch.A funny film nonetheless and is not supposed to be based on reality (GOD FORBID!)
3,hilarous fun,"I HIRED THIS VIDEO IN 1982 THEN AFTERWARDS THE CENSORREFUSED LISTING WHY I DO NOT KNOW.I am 77 now and have never seen it since, its hilariousand I would love to own it"
3,"Ok, Felice Schatcher is in it, so it must be good.","Felice Schatcher stars in this 1980 spoof of Carrie. Everyone remembers 16-year old felice from her role as Nancy on The facts Of life. Scott Baio also stars. Some people remember him as Chachi on Happy Days, or on Joanie Loves Chachi. willie Ames is remembered for his guest appearences on Charles In Charge. Heather Thomas is ugly. Scatman Crothers is always silly. Sue Ann Langton plays the principal, who is most known as nothing in the movie world. Everyone says that there is Nudity in this film, but it is all brief. She is blocking them with her hands. And that photo shows her cheerleading?????"
4,Zapped brings back my childhood,"Zapped was one of my favorite movies when i was a kid. i grew up in love with Scott Baio, so it was hard for me to be objective about this movie. Ok so its corny and when you grow up u see that about the movies you loved as a child, but it also was alot of fun and everytime i watch it i fall in love all over again with Scott Baio. He really is very good in this movie. Along with Scott Baio the rest of the cast brings this movie to life.Ladies and gentlemen who grew up in the 80's this is definately a movie you should rent. It makes you feel like a kid again. This is why i recomend this movie to you!"
3,So -so Movie Fantastic one liner,"I like many viewers saw Zappped! when I was a hormone crazed teenager. However even then I know what I was watching was drivel. However, Willie Ames character delivers a one liner of comeuppance to Heather Thomas character in the prom scene finale that is pure dialogue gold!! If you can catch this one cable one night or at the rental store wait for that scene it is priceless!!"
1,Doesn't work!,This stuff will leave you smelly in just a few hours. I don't see how it could be labeled a deodorant.
1,Magellan External Power Cable with Cigarette Lighter Adapter,"I bought a Magellan Explorist 210 and you sent me the power cable for a Magellan 300, 315 or 320. It will not fit on my Explorist 210. I am in South America and will return to the US in about a week and will return the product to get the correct external power cable. You would think that somebody at Amazon.com would have noticed that the power cable did not match the GPS!"
5,perfect,"Love it. If you use your Mag in the car, you really need one of these. The amount you save on batteries will more than pay for the cost of this item in no time."
2,Stupid connection to the GPS,"I can't understand why the connector consists of a screw-on bracket thing that never seems to tighten right. It just seems dumb. Why not a conventional plug that conveys the power in a straightforward and reliable manner? It works, but there is a big old resistor thing that is cumbersome. I guess if you need external power you really have NO other choice, Magellan designed it that way.It works, but could have been done better."
1,Happy Endings???? I don't think so...,"I bought this DVD documentry thinking there would be hot massage attendants and behind the scenes of some funny things going on in a massage parlor. It turns out it was mostly interviews with government officials and a few cops. I wanted to see the day in life of a massage attendant. It was really boring and it is nothing like the documentry ""Cathouse"". I would give it a poor rating."
5,Absolutely stunning,"Tomaz Salamun is one of the most stunning and original poets alive, and anyone at all interested in poetry should get this book: it is subversive, shocking, and outrageous as well as tender and beautiful."
4,Cold Lost Marbles,"This book is pretty good. I was surprised to see a few bad reviews for something which seems to hold good amount of merit, especially in comparison to most. Of course, it's not Ulysses, or even Burroughs's best. It's simply good.Exterminator!, The Colonel Issues DE, Cold Lost Marbles, and The Perfect Servant have been my favorite passages since I first read it. The book is hilarious if you can manage to analytically wipe the opaque layer of genius-dirt from the neglected window obscuring Burroughs's warm, cozy, funny soul."
3,"A freaky, fractured vision","The back cover of William S. Burroughs' ""Exterminator!"" describes the book as an ""experimental novel."" Because of the book's fragmented, mosaic-like structure, I think you could also describe it as a collection of experimental prose fragments. It's a blend of science fiction, political satire, and linguistic theory, punctuated by violence and gay sex. Burroughs sometimes uses language that mirrors cinematic techniques.If there's a plot in here, it eluded me. Along the way the reader will encounter a secret agent, a pest exterminator, Scientology, the queen of England, and John Genet. ""Exterminator!"" is often outrageous and absurd; it feels at times like Burroughs is just writing to amuse himself."
4,I am a fan of anything Burroughs,"William S. Burroughs had some brilliant works. Although some of them are a little too drug induced (Naked Lunch for example), I still found them enjoyable. This is a collection of incomplete stories or sketches & shorts. This includes, The Priest They Called Him which is one of my favorites from Burroughs. If you are a fan of Burroughs works this is a must have. I found this and Junky to be some of Burroughs easier reads. Interestingly enough, Burroughs did a reading of The Priest They Called him with Kurt Cobain supplying basically feedback as a background noise back in the day. I am glad I own that CD as it is one of my favorites from Burroughs and they are both now dead. Just remember one thing going into this, it's not an actual novel. The stories don't connect and not all of them are finished."
4,Half-sane and descriptive-less intro to Extermination,"Ammm... Huh. Burroughs flits flutters thru eyes like brown beacons to attract lusty exterminators... High on black centipede dust... Fondling remembrances of the Lemon Kid.. Oh... You're new around here, well, as good a spot as any to begin...Unlike other Interzone pieces, here you feel as new jelly... Comfortable, yet gelatinous. The Liquefaction agents cheer through Mexico and law disorders... Everything is addiction... BUt No hangings here... Must for neophytes, tame for WIlliam S, after all... Then you are ready, as a new agent,..,.,.. to go on to deeper levels."
2,Burroughs disconnects,"...and in the case of ""Exterminator!"" that's not a good thing. Granted, this sloppy collection of short stories stitched together as a novel will appeal to fans of the author's fragmented, ""Naked Lunch"" style (run-on sentences, nonsensical incidents, etc.)... but will likely turn anyone else off. The first hundred pages, especially, consist of some of the most alienated, distant, and boring prose I've ever read. For the rest of the novel, however, there are poignant and poetic passages relating to politics, the Vietnam war, and racial and sexual discrimination, among other things, so ""Exterminator!"" isn't entirely worthless, but it's a far cry from Burroughs' best work."
3,the end,"Slow and between the ruins of western civilization,Burroughs discovers the new religion of the flesh.....YES"
1,YUCK!!!,"I got this book because we had to read it for a class that I was taking. I was optimistic when I started it, but several pages in, I put it down and didn't want to pick it back up. Gross, weird, awkward, , and EWWWWWWW are all words that I have to describe it. I tried several times to finish it, but decided instead to pick up on class discussions to aid me in my tests. I just couldn't do it! Totally not my cup of tea!"
5,A great collection,It is a good series to use in teaching weather science on a middle school or high school level. It reinforces the material in the texts and gets the students attention.
4,"Uh, it's Elliot Fisk!","It's Elliot Fisk. He's unbelievable. He could make his guitar knit a sweater if he so desired. The recording is older, so the quality isn't superb, but the music is Paganini and the player is Elliot Fisk. There's nothing like hearing a master play one of the great composers. Great music for studying to!"
4,Terrifying Education,"I LOVE geography, and found this film incredibly educational! It did make me terrified of volcanoes, but I enjoyed learning about the unstable thing that is the Volcano! I never received this particular dvd from Goodwill (who I ordered it from), and found it for free on Netflix."
3,Good but caution for youngsters,"I originally got this for my son who is 4 years old. He has been fascinated by volcanoes and I thought this would be a good video. The video and stories I found were amazing but they do talk about a lot of death and destruction. I was thinking it would talk more about the science of volcanoes but it mainly talked about volcanologists and different violent volcanic eruptions. Again, cool stuff but I didn't anticipate seeing bodies cemented by pyroclastic flows and people struggling to stay alive in lahars. The box says ""not rated"" but I'd day it's a PG 13 or so."
5,Fabulous DVD,"My grandson has been fascinated with Volcanoes since he was 3 years old.This is probably the best video out there. He is now six and has been watching it faithfully ever since. Keep in mind, someone dies in the video so it may not be for everyone but educational...a must. For adults it is wonderful."
4,Perfect!,I'm a huge organizer and recently bought a home with a shower stall versus tub in my bathroom... I desparately needed something to put all of my products in and hang over the top glass wall... it's GREAt fits the LARGE bottles of product... I may get another one!! :)
4,Over the Shower Door Caddy,"This is a great little item. Excellent for getting all those bottles up off the shower floor and ledge where you prop your foot for washing. Makes everything nice, neat and organized and is very attractive. Shelves are also somewhat adjustable."
1,Not a Good Buy,"There were no dimensions listed with this product but it looked larger than it was. Actually, it was very small and overpriced. I was very disappointed in the size because it could not hold more than a couple of bottles. I had to keep using the original shelf unit in addition to the this purchase. This two-shelf unit purchase was so small that it easily fit inside the original shelves that hung in the shower. The only reason I ordered a new shelf unit was because the white plastic coating is peeling off the original brackets and shelves.I would not buy any items for sale on your website after this because the ad was deceptive."
1,For the Shower?,The caddy rusted within 2 months. It now leaves ust on all the bottles on it. Not worth the money when it's not even rust proof.
2,"Did the job, but rusted quickly",Seemed like it started rusting after about a week. Wish I could find one in stainless steel...
3,Very convienent to hang in shower stalls,Have a relatively small shower stall so I needed something to hang over one of the glass enclosures. This was the best value I could find. Nothing special here. It looks ok and has plenty of room to store my shampoo/conditioner bottles with a soap rack on the bottom. My parents were fond of it so I bought them one as well.
1,"""Magic"" didn't work",The whole book is based around magic that apparently happens when you combine complimentary colors in a pattern...but my son and I both looked at the pictures and couldn't see anything happen. Which makes the entire book pointless.
1,Doesn't Keep Time,The first thing I noticed on receiving this watch was that dial on this watch is very difficult to see. The gold hands and numbers do not stand out well against the grey background. The luminescence is rarely visible in the dark. The self winding mechanism does not keep accurate time. I wear a watch out of habit but then slowly realized that because the time was wrong and hard to see it serves no useful purpose. I am now unfortunately shopping for another watch.
3,Mixed feelings,"We bought this watch from Amazon in the UK but it was sent from Mr Watch in the US.This is a pretty watch, although more chunky than expected. Delivery was just in time for Christmas but can't blame the seller for that, it sat over a week in customs but obviously all was in order as no extra taxes were demanded. The watch came in a Seiko box but there was no paperwork at all, no instructions and no warranty. Found instructions online at Seiko but suspect there would be no comeback if watch went wrong - what do you expect for the price? Just two other problems - I had to have links removed from the bracelet before I could wear it and the days shown in the day/date window appear to be in French! But it seems to keep good time and doesn't stop when I take it off overnight."
4,Great Live Listenng,"This is a great album. Neville Brothers live is a whole different experience than the studio recordnings - more surprises, better synchronizing, organic but tight. Best Neville Bros. album I've listened to."
3,Great Gizmo,"I was a little weary on buying this product, because it is a little pricey. I also wondered if it did work that well. I was pleasantly surprised on how well it worked. The only downfall is if you have a lot of acne you have to spend 2 minutes on every spot. This also means that you go through a lot of refills."
4,Not bad...,This is a very interesting product that uses heat to denature acne bacteria heat shock proteins.But it seems to work only on acne that is just starting. Does not seem to work on cystic and conflent acne areas. One major drawback is that every 100 or so 'burns' you need to replace the cap.
2,not that great,"It doesn't make my pimple go away over night. It might reduce some healing time. The treatment cartridge runs out too quick!! You think 60 count is a lot but it's really not. I bought another one for my friend as a gift. It didn't even wanna turn on. I had to send it back. I called the number on the box. Their customer service sucks, they never picked up the phone or return my phone call ever. I had to send it back to amazon."
3,Was great while it worked...,This product really does work. I enjoyed it. But it stopped working altogether after a few months. A bit expensive for such a short time.
3,Broken tea bags,"The string breaks off the tea bag, the bag opens up in the cup of hot water, the tea floats all over the inside of the cup. This is the first batch of tea bags that have broken like that. I don't know if it's a bad batch or what has happened. ? Bought the tea from amazon."
3,I've had better...,"I have had better, I usually useAlvita - Ginger Root (Caffeine Free), 24 bagbut was unable to get some... I saw this for prime and tried it out. It lacks the ginger hotness and kick that you get with the Alvita, and I dont feel the same relief from Nausea I get with the Alvita, but they are okay. Its okay, not great, but okay."
3,tea bags,"The ginger tea is good for your health. However, do not add ""BOILING"" water to them, it causes the bag to burst. Otherwise, very satisfied. :)"
4,so comfy,our dog loved the bed the minute it was put on the floor. he's a pretty big dog 105lb. and can curl up in it - nice and spacious. am just now not liking the fact that the cover slips off now and again but all in all happy with the purchase
1,"Awful bed, save your money!",The lining on this bed tore the day after I got it. After the first wash the exterior looked used and old and then the foam eventually came unglued. I wrote to Dog Bed King twice about how upset I was and they never even responded. I will never buy from them again and suggest you do the same.
2,Not a fan.,"When we first received the bed we loved it and so did our dog. But if you plan to wash the lambswool cover it will no longer fit the padding, and the whole thing is pretty much useless. Wasted my money."
1,Terrible quality! Don't waste your money!,"These dog beds were/are way overpriced for the quality. The foam is most similar to egg crate foam, incredibly cheap and easily ripped up. The egg crate foam is covered with a thin, removable fabric, it is not covered all the way around. Big waste of money, I was hoping for durable beds and got foam with a sheet over it."
5,Huge!,"Our giant schnauzer Oliver is... well, giant! He's a lanky 110 lbs and he fits perfectly snuggled up in this bed and can even stretch out a bit. I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this bed for the price. Anything simlilar at this size would be a hundred dollars or more (trust me, I have done a lot of searching). It's true, the cover doesn't cover the bottom portion but I think that has actually worked out to be very convenient in the removal and replacement of it. Anyone who has ever owned a dog bed with a washable cover knows that it never goes back on quite as pretty as it was brand new. But really, I found this one easier to replace and refit than the covers for our mini schnauzers beds which were much more pricey. It takes washing very well! No fluff left in the washer or around. I would buy this bed again in a heartbeat. Oliver couldn't be happier with his new ""snuggle bed"". Thanks for an inexpensive, high quality, made in the USA product!"
1,Worst customer service ever!,"I bought this bed for my 70 pound hound/pit mix. My dog managed to completely destroy the cover to it. When I tried to buy a new cover, I noticed that the dimensions of the covers were different than the dimensions of the bed that I originally purchased. I tried to call customer service to ask about this. There is no answer on the customer service line, only a recording asking the customer to leave a message. I did this twice over the course of a week, but never received a call back. Thinking they might be having a phone or voice mail problem, I then send an e-mail. Again, I have gotten no response. As far as I'm concerned if you can't get customer service from a company I don't want to do business with them!"
2,Adam,"This dog bed should only be used in a cold place. I have short haired Labrador Retriever that is 3 months old and he could not stay in the dog bed for a long period of time. I usually have my house at 65f to 70f degrees and my Lab would overheat in the dog bed. I would not recommend using this dog bed indoors. Unfortunately, this dog bed will be put to use in the garage."
3,Cover does not envelope the whole thing,"It's okay. My dog likes it, though most of the time, he also just sleeps on the wood floor. What I don't like about it is that there's no cover on the bottom of it, so the dog has access to the foam, which he takes chunks out of on a daily basis."
5,A new application of 1500 yr old advice -- Essential reading,"Thomas humbly lets the ancient father's of Christianity share pearls not tainted by our 90's cultural perspective.Essential reading for ALL Christians desiring maturity in their life for God without the hype of a new 'spiritual' formula.Surely a classic along the lines of Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"", Packer's ""Knowing God"", and Bunyon's ""Pilgim's Progress""."
4,Excelent Read,"I really enjoyed the ""Magic Time"" series. This book was by far my favorite out of the series. Unlike the first in the series, this book was easy to get into right from the start. It finalized the story line in a very conclusive manor."
4,Good Read,"Good read. 3rd and final book in a series. Got addicted to it when I read the 2nd one before the 1st and was hooked. If you like Post-Apocalyptic type books with a little magic involved, then this series is for you."
3,Somewhat of a glorified brochure,"I suppose the word ""Official"" on the cover should have been a good clue, but I was still surprised to find little criticism in this book. There is helpful information, but it reads as if written by a publicist for Disney. I wish I had spent my money on the ""unofficial"" guide for some more objective advice."
5,The best single Asian cookbook!,"If you only own one Asian cookbook, this should be it. Madhur Jaffrey provides authentic, delicious--and beautifully illustrated--recipes from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Singapore, Japan, and more. Just as in her Indian cookbooks, she collects recipes from both restaurants and good home cooks. Best of all, at the back of the book she has included pages of photographs of ingredients, packaged and loose. Armed with this book, you can successfully shop for exotic ingredients anywhere, even when many things are unlabelled and you and the proprietor do not share a common language!"
4,Better than the last,"As a long-time fan of Ragnar Benson, I jumped on the oportunity to get his newest edition. If you thought the last edition of street survival was goo, you'll love this one."
3,Not a bad starting point...,"Mr. Benson's guide to urban survival is an interesting, if not very deep, guide to surviving some very hard times in an urban area. He touches on all the basic topics that one will need to know about in order to survive, and applies a basic 'rule of threes' strategy to all of them. Unfortunately, the book never gets beyond the basics of the topics presented. You're also going to have to wade through a lot of contradictory information to assess what is best for your situation. For example, he discourages solar power as it is expensive and could compromise the location of your retreat, but he praises the noisy and expensive diesel generator later. Overall though, this book is worth a read. One very strong word of caution, however. Take his food storage section with a very large grain of salt. The information presented there is dubious at best, and his guide to canning meats with a steam bath canner could very well get you killed."
1,Not worth buying,"Ragnar is a person who doesn't provide any actual survival information. He has never actually had to live the live of a survivalist. He even states in several parts that the ""been there, done that"" crowd, meaning survivors in Beruit and other places say that his ideas are not practical or even feasable.Another disturbing shortcoming is that Rasgnar switches between urban and rural survival when it is convienent or he needs to sidestep a problem.From the standpoint of a homeless veteran who has to live the life of a survivalist everyday, I can say that none of his ideas are practical or even feasable."
1,What the bleep,"Selling a 2007 travel book in 2012 when there is a 2010 edition available????????? Now this book looks like it's really good but travel books become dated really quickly. Note, they offer it at an extra cheap price but don't be tempted because you'll be rudely surprised when you show up at someplace that is closed and undergoing renovation."
4,No burning,"This is just what I hoped for. It functions as a quick trivet if I take a dish out of the oven or find something boiling over. It doesn't get wet with steam, like the cloth ones. (as often happens when I lift jars out for canning). Best of all, it won't burn if I accidentally leave in on a hot burner, which is what happened to my last hot pad. However, it is not lower priced than in the regular stores, so don't buy it if you don't have free shipping and handling."
3,Okie,"This guide book is well detailed, and interesting. But nothing to crown about when you read Peterson's Guides and the rest of the guides book. I have not verified the accuracy of information yet, but it seems to stand well on its own"
1,Basement Jaxx disappoint!,"I was really looking forward to getting hold of Basement Jaxx' Remedy immediately after its release this summer, but I'd never thought they would end up making such a complete failure! It's crap music, screwed up tunes, poor samples and just a mockery of what House Music is all about!Buy their earlier ""Atlantic Jaxx Recordings - A Compilation"" if you're interested in hearing some of their better tunes. Those songs are the ones that made the press hype these guys."
2,Extremely Overrated,"This is not a _bad_ album, it is an OK album. You would think, however, after reading many of the pre-release reviews, that it had been transmitted by god to the ears of us mortals. Most of the songs sound very similar to each other, and all have some annoying elements. Put this one on the shelf and listen to Crystal Method, Meat Beat Manifesto, or Moby instead."
1,Dissapointing,"I loved Red Alert, so I bought the Red Alert single, it had another cool song by Basement Jaxx on it, so I boguht this whole album. Yo-yo is a good song if they omitted the chorus of yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo, and the other good song, of course, Red Alert, but that's all, don't buy it please."
1,Too Hyped,"I made the mistake of buying Remedy and found it to be very disappointing and musically irritating. Yo-Yo has to be the worst song that I have heard in quite some time. Throughout the album there is an overriding cacophony of blips and bleeps that creates a choppy flow. If over-produced, Latin-infused, bigbeat house is your thing buy this album or some Ricki Martin remixes. If not, save your money!"
4,Yeah......Yeah,"I've really gotten into these tunes. Not necessarily for their dance orientation, but I've also found a British group, who know how to mix it up successfully.My favorite is ""Same Old Show"". What a mix!!!! I've taken this tune during my own dj'ng, and regardless of how I remix it, or edit it, it still has been a hit with everyone. Yes, I definately recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys dance music, but likes a mix also. I'm checking out other releases, and will definately review them later."
3,"One of the better runway-house music records out, but...","Out of 15 tracks, probably 5 keep me interested in this CD. The rest of it is just okay club stuff. The few spots of singing are very strong showings, and the beats are fast and wild. But, come on: 2/3 of the CD is the same old 4-on-the-floor stuff you hear in any only-OK club. Wait for the price to drop on this one. The songs that are good will still be good when you get around to it. It's one of the better house/dance music records out now (and integral to any mobile DJ/radio's playlist), but that doesn't mean as much as it did, say, 5 years ago."
2,"Alright, but in no way the most progressive work of the year","I bought this over last summer following on a tide of glowing reviews. Having heard the great tracks 'Red Alert' & 'Rendez Vu' on the radio sealed the purchase. But 6 months on and this CD has failed to grow on me as a whole. About the first half of the album is good danceable material but the second half just seems like real filler stuff. Unfortunatly it's terribly over-hyped. I'd listen before you buy, but if you like it, great. It's just not my thing.Look towards Orbital, BT, Underworld and Moby if you want the most consistantly innovative pioneers of the genre."
4,Good but not the Best,"I have never heard of Basement Jaxx before buying this CD, so I can say without prejudice. As a House music fan, this isn't that bad. 3 stars will be enough, but some titles are really nice that I'll be generous and give them four."
2,What?,dude this album did not makes me wanna dance at all. this is no innovation at all and if this is the future of the now-bland house scene count me out. Cassius does this much better.
2,It kind of sucks!!!,"I see my first review wasn't posted, maybe I was too mean. So I'll just say for a British House music lover, this CD & the import is a let down. But check out the remixes that are out there......"
3,Not as good as advertised,"Not the ""party album"" it was touted to be, but it had some phat beats. I doesn't exactly do the Astralwerks label justice. Better off choosing a Fatboy Slim or Cassiu's new album."
3,"Good start, BUT...","I have been giving this CD a lot of spins, but I cannot say that I've been able to warm up to it. To me Rendez-Vu, and YO-Yo are outstanding tracks, but the rest is just okay (Red Alert, Jump N' Shout, Bingo Bango), or simply annoying (Don't Give Up, Being with You). I really tried to like the whole CD... and failed; but hey, it's still worth the money for the first two songs."
5,My favorite CD,"This CD is the best. It's exactly what I needed to life my spirts. It reminds me of driving fast down the freeway late at night. It just sets my mind free of confusion. Rende-vu is one of my favorite songs of all time. Jump and Shout, YoYo, and Red Alert are also some of my favorites. Its a perfect CD."
2,Basement Suxx,"This CD certainly does not live up to the hype that preceded it. It does little to advance electronic music. There are a couple of standout songs, but overall this CD is filled with rather generic house. I'm disappointed."
1,Not good,"Oh god -- if you have any love of real club music, you'll avoid this one. This is no more ""dance music"" than Shania Twain is country. I've heard this album described as ""fun,"" but it's only fun in that desperate way that slick crap like ""Wild Wild West"" is fun. It gets old -- fast. You want real dance music? Grab a DJ Dan mix or Omar Santana or the Harkiss Brothers. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID"
2,"Creative, but not in a good sense!","Maybe it's just me, but when I played this album, I thought I was listening to some bad hiphop. Calling this CD ""techno"" is kind of misleading...the style is something that I haven't heard before. Not quite Prodigy, nor Chem Bros, nor Moby, nor FatBoy Slim, nor Orbital. Or anything else.Needless to say, it sucks. Okay, so it's not that bad, but I recommend looking for singles of ""Rendez-Vu"" and ""Red Alert"". And if you happen to like or even *love* those two tracks, keep your singles, turn around, and don't look back. Cuz the rest of the album is awful."
1,RED ALERT! THIS CD SUCKS,"Good thing my friend bought this CD before I went out and got it. The only song I liked on it was RED ALERT. Save your money and get the Maxi-Single. No matter how many times you listen to this CD, it won't grow on you."
2,Some good songs but in overall overrated,"Don't get me wrong i think they have some good ideas in their music and groups that aren't afraid to mix the genres are a positive thing. But unfortunately they cannot turn the diffrent genres into pure dance, all songs includes some dance beats in the backround ofcourse but it isn't enough. ""Rendezvous"" and ""Red Alert"" and ""Bingo Bongo"" that sound like a samba party are class songs but there are also many songs on the Cd that has nothing to do with dance, like the annoying ""Yo-Yo"", ""Jam N Shout"" where a guy that sounds like Shaggy stands for the lyrics. Basement jaxx are simply un-even, they couldn't make a album with only good stuff. If you're into some good dance music i recommend Cassius or Daft Punk for example."
2,Dissapointed,"Always on the lookout for a new hot cd or the next artist who will totally blow me away, I stumbled upon Basement Jaxx's highly-touted single ""red alert"" and the subsequent cd ""remedy"". I purchased said cd and guess what...I was Not impresed. Dont get me wrong, some songs were ok like ""rendevous"", but overall, the beats and production did not blow me away(generic house with bland instrumentation) If u really want some excellent french-house/techno, check out Daft Punk, Dj Dimitri, Cassius, or as a last resort, Air, but leave Basement Jaxx in the basement-A.N."
1,What a ripoff.,"Except for three or four bars from the ""Red Alert"" track (the ones used in the Coke commercial), this album is just re-packaged europop. Sounds just like Eiffel 65 and the like.Nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing memorable, nothing that leaves you humming long after you listen. *shrug* I sent it back."
5,A Classic!,This is one of the best dance albums of all time. Basement Jaxx have one of the most unique imagination in the dance business and I hope that they don't stop with the albums.
1,"If you like RED ALERT, buy the single and avoid this mistake","Compared to previous releases, there is no remedy for the damage this cd will due to ones ears. If you liked Red Alert, dont fear, its also on this cd(Is this a marketing ploy or what??) anyhow. I love bassment jaxx, and didnt find this cd worth the loot. Save your money.. Go buy some ritchie hawtin or paul johnson"
5,A absolute belter!,"If you have not heard this band then you must, they turn the faceless and forgettable world of dance music into one of namedropping fabulousness. The tracks are catchy, funky, rocking and ever so slightly barmy. Not a track on the album could be accussed of sounding like any other, these guys have a knack for celebrating and trendifying the nafist samples and embedding them in your head in a naughtily, wonderful, hypnotic manner! An absolute ""must have"" album purchase."
4,"I've got you in my heart, I've got you in my head","Rendez-vu is arguably the best dance track of the 90's. It never leaves your head; the immense layering of the song creates a lush and fresh sound that's mellow and dark yet hopeful. Let's face it, the tunes that are mellow and melodic are the ones that send the chills up our spine. Basically, Rendez-vu is worth the price of the album ALONE. It's a bonus that the rest of the album is produced in the spirit of this track. The rest of the album ain't bad, but Rendez-vu most effectively encapsulates the potential these guys have."
5,"It's so FuNkY, I love it! ...","When you hear a Basement Jaxx song, you KNOW it's Basement Jaxx! They've created their own new style all their own. You haven't heard anything until you listen to this! If you like to dance and have fun, I suggest you purchase this CD. You won't regret it! One of my top favorite CDs and artists."
3,Diversly disapointing,The two songs I had heard that convinced me to buy this album are excellent but stand alone on this random album. I felt the best came first and the drizzle was saved for last. By the end you will feel a little disapointed in how much the tracks begin to lull. Better luck next time.
1,JUST PLAIN BAD.....,"Let me start out by saying that if this is the best of House Music......then leave me out! This cd is nothing but generic techno...at it's WORSE. The unlistenable lyics and horrible vocals add up to a very ugly sounding music. I know I sound a little harsh(you should have heard my review that didn't get on) but you should realy listen to this album before you decide to buy it, because I bought it randomly and it was the worst purchase I have made in the past year!"
4,Is it the real timing???,"Some songs of this record ar no longer than 15 or 20 seconds...Is this OK? Did they make that way or what...Actually i downloaded them from a friend's computer so i don't know if he hasém bad or what.Please, someone answer me cause i wanna knowI'm from ArgentinaThanxx"
3,"It's good, but I'll try a different remedy next time...","I think this CD is a bit overrated. The dance singles ""Red Alert"", ""Jump N Shout"", ""Bingo Bango"" and ""Rendez-Vu"" are above average, but apart from that, this CD doesn't have much to offer. There are a couple of similar tracks like ""Yo-Yo"" but they're not amazing, and the short tracks ""Jaxxilude"", ""Jazzilude"" and ""Gemilude"" are just bad. A lot of this album is noise not music. A bit overrated, and I won't rush to buy the sequel."
4,groovy,"I'm really an alternative rock person. I never gave House music a second though until I heard Basement Jaxx. They're not the conventional techno disco band. They've got flamenco guitars, electronic synthesizers, etc...a real good mix, if you ask me. The first BJ song I heard was Rendez-Vu and it's great. I also like Jump N' Shout."
4,Something different...,"Finally, the Basement Jaxx cd was released.It was one of the most expected releases of 1999, and it's worth the money. A revolutionary turning point in the electronic music style. No cold electronic beats and spacy sounds that makes techno & house so unoriginal. This is the dance music we all waited for: hiphop, mambo and disco influences are mixed all through the album, with a little touch of experimental music. On the floor everybody!!! If you thought electronic music isn't danceable but artificial... buy this. It's 100% fun."
5,The Jaxx rule the dancefloor,"This debut album offers every genre of dance you could possibly imagine. There's techno, raggae, funk and even flamenco! I guarantee you won't be taking this CD out of your player for a long time."
5,Awesome album from the next big thing...,"This is a great album for dance fans wanting to get away from the Fatboy Slim mainstream going on lately. This is an awesome album that offers many genres of dance into one, with all of them being awesome tracks to make you move. From salsa to house, its all there. I highly recommend this album as a person who follows the dance scene very closely. Check it out!"
4,Simple Sondheim,"Rarely does one find simple arrangements of great songs that remain so faithful to the composer's sound. Almost without exception, Evans' arrangements are beautiful, sound like Sondheim, and easy enough for a novice to play (even sight-reading!) I absolutely recommend this collection to anyone who loves Sondheim but can't play most of his music!"
5,Amazing and majestic,"I was really moved by this video, the scenery, the moose and other animals, incredible! This was very well done and informative."
1,The Story of the Nutcracker Ballet,"The reason I ordered this book was because the little girl's name is Clara.However, the name has been changed to Marie. How could that be? This is a classic holiday tradition. This book is not authentic.The book was ordered as a gift for a little girl named Clara. The namealtering should be stated so others won't be as disappointed as I am."
2,Yeah Sure.........,"This CD is pretty much a joke.....They took great songs and tried to redo them and made them sound awful....Check out ""still"" if you want to hear what this once great band was about...or search on soulseek for the demos of the other songs they redid..don't support this band and thier money grubbing efforts...."
3,choke,The song choke and the rest of the songs i listened to all sounded(no offense) like u were chocking. i've heard a lot better
2,A pain on the eyes,"Besides being terribly uneven and unbearably long, ""Tales of Gaslight New York"" is simply reduced reprinted pages from old Harper's magazines. Reduced and reprinted = real hard on the eyes. The very fine print, in multi-column format will have you checking your eyeglass prescription. Unfortunately, as I said, the book is also incredibly long and not many of the articles included are unique. The only selections that have anything to recommend this are on the history of New York Police and on children's street games. But considering the price of the book, I cannot in good conscience advise anyone to purchase this."
1,Could not finish,"I have never not finished a book. I can get through just about anything. However, I did not finish this book. I read the reviews here on Amazon. At the time there were 12 good reviews and 2 reviews that said don't waste your time. Well I purchased the book and kept reading and reading....surely it would catch my attention at some point. I just couldn't stomach it anymore. It was just so awfully boring and a complete waste of time."
3,october light,slow getting into this book. hoping to enjoy this during my vacation I am having a hard time getting started however I will give it a sporting chance
2,Baffled,"I titled this review ""baffled"" because that is how I felt while reading, and after finishing, this novel. Baffled because most of the reviews I read (it had received a high star rating) praised the manner of writing, story line, etc.. I still feel ""left out"" as to why it received this praise. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this novel for someone of similar taste or interest. I questioned why the author chose this odd venue to explore how our childhood experiences form our personality. It held my interest, especially with ""the novel within a novel"" approach, but mainly because I wondered where the author was heading and then began hoping the plot would take a different turn at the end. Quite disappointed. It was simply too odd for me!"
5,Love this stuff,"This is basically the ""No More Tangles"" your mom used on your hair when you were a kid, but it has a Strawberry scent. And, I don't know why, but J&J is changing their product line, so I had to order this from an online supplier because I can't find this particular bottle in the discount stores anymore. Too bad, cause it is great for naturally curly hair."
3,could have been..better,"I love this movie only for one thing. Drew barrymore. I think this has been her best role yet. But other than that the movie was a bit boring, chris was just.. not good enough to act with drew. he made this movie boring. and the parents were boring. only good thing was drew."
1,Not a masterpiece...,One of the less intereting movie I've seen. The movie lasts too long and it has no purpose. The plot is very shallow (two teenagers running away but they have problems). I highly recommend to avoid this movie.
3,Casey is NOT clinically depressed.,"This movie is cute, but not factual. I always worry when I see mental illnesses treated as interchangeable. Drew Barrymore's character Casey exhibits class bipolar symptoms, which include irrational thoughts, suicidal depression, and wild mood swings going from risk taking mania to the immobility of depression. I just wish they'ed been able to portray it for what it was. Of course making a movie about clinical depression symptoms wouldn't have involved the car stealing and drama. Just lots of Drew sitting in her room, unable to muster the energy to find Chris O'Donnell interesting. Not as good a movie, I suppose."
2,I've never seen the whole thing!!!,I was an extra in this movie over a decade ago & that's the only reason I bought it. But I never seem to get past the two scenes I'm in. Which tells you how compelling this movie is. I love Drew and would just like to say she's as adorable and sweet in real life as she is on any screen. Two stars because the movie really does blow but I only spent a total of maybe $5. And $5 to have my 4 seconds of fame and all the memories of the Seattle Scene back in the 90's...priceless.
5,GREAT MOVIE,Mad Love is one of my favorite movies. I cry every time I see it. I can totally relate To Drew in the movie. This is an awesome movie and I would definately recomend it. It is one of Drew's best movies thus far. Mad Love is a must see.
4,GOOD MOViE! =),"hey, who ever is reading this you need to watch this movie!!this is one of my favorite movies now,i was even crying and its the best movie with drew barrymore (in my opinon)Its about this guy who falls in love with this new girl from chicago and then they spend lots of time together but then he finds out she needs clinical help for her mood swings,she even tried commiting suicide before.they run away from home and make a plan to go to mexico but then it didnt work out so they came home to try and help her get better.. trust me u need to watch this to know all the details!! its a great movie - mad love <3"
4,Fits our needs,"These were smaller than I thought when they arrived, but we have a Trailmaster travel trailer and they are a perfect size for it. Compact, not bulky and works great."
4,A Must Have,"Every recreational vehicle should have a set--or two--of these stowed below. I thought I would be clever and save a few bucks by making my own, and they work just fine. But I've encountered a couple of occasions where I've needed something else, such as the time I stubbed my toe in the dark (love the bright yellow color of these!) on my homemade jack pad while fetching supplies from stowage, or the time our ""long, level pull-through"" site meant level side-to-side: I had to use a mish-mash of firewood and borrowed jack pads to stabilze the back end of our 5th wheel (having an extra pack to share is just plain neighborly--thanks again Tim S.!)while camping out of state this summer.This product is gear 101 for all camping units--you won't regret it."
5,Stabilizer jack pads,Bought these to go with the jack stands I purchased and they worked great.They stack to each other and comes with a nice velcro strap to keep them together.Seem like good quality and should stand the test of time.Would recommend these pads.
3,serves purpose but could be tougher,"When I received these, one was broken in a small corner but I just kept it rather than return. It didn't affect the usage. I would say it serves the purpose but so does a piece of wood which would be tougher. The construction is just ok in my opinion, I would recommend just improvising with even pieces of plywood (cheaper and better alternative)."
4,Like the solid part that goes on the ground,"I have another set of pads that I used under the stablizers of our camper, but I don't like the honeycombed backing that I have to clean to get the sand/dirt that got stuck in the individual squares.These seem easier to clean, plus I like the handles on the pads and the strap that came with them for easier storage.Time will tell if they warp."
1,Too Small To Be Practical or Useful,"The pic used is deceptive and no where is there deminsions of the pads offered. I wished i had read the reviews as i would not have purchased them. Like the previous customer stated, these pads are too small to be used on anything but a toy. Pay more and get something useful.Sorry customer in Michigan"
1,small,"I purchased these thinking that they would be large enough to fit the 6000 lb. jack stands I bought. but they were not, apparently they are made for tongue jack sizedloads and not for stabilizing jacks. They should only be used on paved lots and not for camping where the surface is uneven or the rv is parked on soil. I am looking for larger pads now, but will keep the small pads for the tongue jack."
2,Too small for our RV,"We bought these thinking they would work for our RV hydrolic jacks. They won't. They are too small and cheap, our jacks would crush them. We will instead use them for leveling our camp stove."
2,Made for tiny jacks,"I should have known better than to buy these stabilizer jack pads when I couldn't find their dimensions anywhere on the net. They would be a great product for jacks that have a small footprint, but my stabilizer jack's bottom plates are almost the same size as the pads. I got what I paid for and I'll just use them as drink coasters or something."
2,Jack pad review,"these pads are about 2 inches short to match up fully with the existing base of my scissor jacks, they work ok on solid ground or to protect blacktop, but could be bigger for use on soft ground."
1,Dont waste your money,Total Crappola! 6 x 6 cheap plastic. I see this cracking as soon as you put weight on it. Never opened it. It was returned the second I took it out of the box. Picture is misleading. They are small...and cheap!
4,Perfect,"These jack pads are exactly what I wanted, rugged, durable and they will stow away nicely............they work great!They were shipped timely and arrived right before we needed them.........."
3,A little small,They aren't much bigger than the pads on my camper jack. I guess the best thing I can say about them is they keep my jack pads out of the dirt so they wont rust. They do help a little bit. But I wish they were a little bigger.
2,Not another cover album,I love Lington's early albums. Mainly original stuff.I am not saying covers are all bad. But it seems toshow that he cannot come up with new material.So now he has gone to the dark side. First it was Rod Stewartdoing all covers.Now the smooth jazz greats are getting lazy and doing the samething. Chris Botti did some great original work and now hehas done two cover albums. I think Peter White has done the same.
2,PRETTY BORING!!,"I really like the songs Lington has selected, especially STING's ""FRAGILE"", Elton's ""SORRY SEEMS TO BE THE HARDEST WORD"" and Paul Simon's ""STILL CRAZY......"" but these are not songs meant for sax instrumentals - it's boring and I felt like I was listening to a sax player at a wedding."
1,Lawn mower battery G50 N18L A,"I never would have bought this item if I had known there was no acid included with the purchase.Every one around here quit supplying acid long ago and there is none to be found.I drove many miles and found some only to have to pay an additional $12.00 for the acid.I found the same battery at wal mart 50 miles from home that sold the battery for $50.00 plus all needed acid in box.I definetly felt ripped off,which I was.I have over $70.00 plus many miles plus 12.00 acid and when I received first battery it was busted and I had to take to nearest Fed ex office which was 60 miles round trip so they could see damage.All the above would have been cheaper and less trouble if I had bought a new mower.Never will I deal with this company again.I welcome all comments.Gary"
1,Battery does not charge,"The battery does not charge in the original charger which comes with the camera. Totally useless.I still have the original battery, which is charging ok and lasting quite long. Bought this extra one for the camping holidays without power supply... but, this is, when inserted into the charger, the charger blink the light a couple of times and power itself off. In the manual says this means ""wrong type of battery"" - but my camera is a DMC-FZ7, as said in the description...totally disapointed.I do not recommend."
4,jehst! is he the greatest?,"Slick beats, sick lyrics, and a mind full of dirt like a can of worms. Jehst is amazing, his style captures an imagination you thought you never had. After listening to the album now for quite sometime it tends to wear out a bit but this is still a great album. Songs to check '1979' and 'the trilogy' also look out for the 'trilogy remix' thats not on this album you'll have to hunt around for that."
5,Great to begin,"I loved this book. As a person who is interested in Aromatherapy, the authors advise gave me detailed information about the benefits of this time-honored therapy."
4,Sweetly elegant!,"""Aromatiques"" by Eva-Marie Lind is an artful, sensual delight! Eloquently written aromatherapy information presented with the flower of poetry. Gorgeous photography. I recommend perusing this book while soaking in a fragrant bubbly tub with candles and a glass of bubbly!!!"
5,superb writing,"As the manufacturer of aromatherapy diffusers, I own about 40 fine books on aromatherapy. Many of these books have duplicate information....not Aromatiques. It is an original. At first, the wonderful pictures and superb writing stood out. Now, however, I most appreciate the valuable facts contained and the sensuous pleasure re-reading each page. Anne & Gerry McCarthy, Leyden House, Leyden, MA"
4,Lots of great images,"This book is full of beautiful photos that illustrate how you can eat more food in greater volumes if you watch the calories. It shows how to make somewhat more healthy choices versus higher calorie, less nutritious foods.His diet is based a lot on carbs so if you have issues digesting carbs then this diet may not be the best approach for you. But otherwise the transition of unhealthy heavily caloried foods to something a bit better and far more filling is good over all advice.Elecia, MO"
5,My first Dr Shapiro book!,"Wow! This guy really puts things into perspective! I mean, ""Who knew?"". Yes, we all have the smarts to turn the lable around, but how many of us do? This guy shows us that by just substituting, or ""juggeling"" portions, we can still get the same satisfaction, but only half the calories!"
1,HOW MANY CALORIES IN A MUFFIN?,"Does a corn muffin really have 750 Calories??? I can't find anything to verify that a muffin could have so many calories? Can anyone be of assistance? I was all ready to proceed with this diet until a friend pointed out that the first example had a wild calorie count showing for it, i.e. the corn muffin."
2,"Works, But Is Highly Disappointing...","I will admit that this guide to weightloss does work effectively, but there is a great flaw. That flaw is that the weight that you loose is extra easy to put back on again. Once you start this program, you can never stop. So if you are looking for a way to loose the pounds and KEEP THEM OFF, this is not the book/plan you would like to go with."
5,What planet is this guy from?,"Wow, I don't know just happened to me. Dallas Perkins plays the guitar like no one I have ever heard. It is kinda like the Satriani style but more 'intrusive' I feel like I have been violated but,, I think I liked it.. Yes yes I did like it..This CD is more than just Guitar playing. Eden Girl is a song that I have not gotten out of my head in about 4 days!! Get this CD!"
5,A sneak peek into the mind of Houdini!,"It's well-known among Houdini buffs that much of Houdini's writing was ghostwritten for him. So what? This was part of his role as a master publicist. Nevertheless, this book is a great insight into Houdini's mind and methods, because it's certain that he had at least a hand in the production of all of the material in this book. There is no single book that gives a greater insight into the scope of Houdini's interests than this one."
4,Boston Blackie's Chinese Venture,"It is wonderful to see Boston Blackie available officially and with a great print as well.This was the fourteenth and last in the series, but I am encouraged that Sony may release the rest of the series soon. Bootleg DVDs do not do justice to these little gems which feature Chester Morris as Boston Blackie, who keeps the story going with a touch of adventure and comedy rolled into one.Solving a murder and stolen gems racket, are only part of the plot as Blackie has to also keep from the clutches of Inspector Faraday, who likes to arrest Blackie on any pretext.Overall 59 minutes well spent. Thanks to Sony for finding such pristine source material and providing a great DVD transfer. P{lease release the rest of the series soon."
5,LE MEJOR INFORMACION QUE SE HA PUBLICADO,"SOBRE TODOS LOS ANTIDEPRESIVOS...Impactante y INDISPENSABLE,porque la persona no informada es la que tiene màs tropiezos...Te lo recmoiendo muaho, amigo. Ademàs, està bien escrito y es SUPER AMENO E INTERESANTE"
3,ok,"I am not crazy about this book simply because it is a Concise translation. Otherwise it is a fine work. If you arent familiar with the scholastic set up or how it works this is probably the work for you, or are a ""casual"" reader of Thomas perhaps. I cannot quite imagine a casual reader of Thomas but thats ok. I would definitely recomend at least looking at the real thing at least once. The Benziger Bros. edition is probably one of the best, it keeps the scholastic structure that is, I think, so important especially for philosophical work. As someone familiar with medieval scholastic philosophy I could hardly imagine trying to slog through Thomas without the inherent structure to the argument that the scholastic form brings to it which is pretty much the part that gets sacrificed for conciseness in this version."
5,A higher reason!,"Regardless of your religious perspective (or lack thereof), you will learn that the basis for a great deal of modern ethical rationale is rooted in the wisdom of Aquinas. This translation is regarded as most readable by those brighter than I; however, as a physician on our academic medical center's Ethics Committee and a Palliative Care Consultative Service, I enjoy the notion that this scholar's influence is profound regardless of one's existential/religious/spiritual biases. I admittedly have to read it in small portions and often cross reference to other areas in the text. At almost 60 years of age, it is especially fun to read this and think of it not as an obligatory chore and more of edification."
4,Those darn tracks!,"This album is excellent, except that it is spoilt by let's say two tracks. The good stuff is a mingling of orchestration and melody with techno (my all-time favorite is Goodbye, Goodbye), while the bad tracks (like The Motorbike Track) seem to be derived from some new commercial drum'n'bass or techno album, ideal for 12 year olds. What a pity!"
1,i'm a huge u-ziq fan and this album blows,mike p missed the boat on this oneone or two decent tracksbut mostly cheesy strings and sample and grating noisesave your money! or spend it on one of his earlier releases.
2,an A for effort. . .but i'm still givin' you 2 stars mike,"i would strongly recommend buying the brace yourself ep, lunatic harness full lengh, and his ""kid spatula"" work instead. . .its the best stuff he has recorded."
1,Binned and never to be taken out,Two people got this right in all the reviews I read. 1 star. It does not deserve anymore than that. There are three good songs and the rest are just rubbish. The three good tracks are1. Scaling 2. Carpet Muncher 3. Motorbike TrackI bought the CD on all the 4 and five stars reviews that people were giving this CD. Man was I fooled and majorly disappointed. I have listened to it umpteen times waiting for that hit when you realise that this is great music but it never came. This CD is headed for the Second hand shop ASAP.
5,Absolutely Stellar,"Groovy, cerebral, evil, divine, echanting, complex, addictive and much more. This is one of the most unique and inspired albums I've heard since Aphex Twin's ""Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2"" I was very impressed by the ""Brace Yourself"" EP and ""Lunatic Harvest,"" but this new album has something quite magical about it. It never fails to surprise you. Music doesn't get this perfect unless your brain can sing. Paradinas, like Richard D. James, is totally in touch with the creative and schizophrenic insight that verges into the realm of madness and beauty. Regardless of what came before it, this album is one of kind. Paradinas rules!"
3,This is not that good of an album.....,"Really, as much as I tried to like this disk, it is frankly uninspired and not nearly as good as any of Paradmis's other albums nor as good of a lot of albums by 'lesser' artists that were released at the same time. This album is accessible but only in ways that make it seem as if the artist kinda sold out to get there; although I like a couple of the tracks, I can't even bring myself to listen to this album at all anymore.Anyone who wants to listen to good stuff, either buy Lunatic Harness, or buy something by one of the other 'similar' artists on the list included here. Try Boards of Canada if you don't already have it...."
5,Best available for American English speakers,"I have used Katzner's dictionaries since 1988 and have never encountered any problems. Before that, for the first three years, I used a variety of British variant dictionaries and encountered frequent problems. Nothing is more frustrating to me than translating a Russian word/idiom I don't know into an ENGLISH word I don't know or at least, don't fully understand. My fellow American students along the way all felt the same: Katzner was a God-send. My only critique of the Katzner dictionaries is that I wish they provided more assistance with the participial forms created from the verbs."
2,not up to par,"I opened the dictionary to check a couple of words -- not there. The dictionary is fine to stick it on your shelf, but if you want to use it, there are a number of negatives:1. There is no Russian alphabet in the dictionary. Since the order of the letter in the Russian and English is different, this makes it a pain looking up for words.2. There is no ""visual aid"" (like tabs, or cut outs, or such)to speed up search for words -- you need to make your own tabs and stick them to pages3. The dictionary is rather expensive for what it offers. (The retail price is $39.99 although I purchased it on amazon.com for less.)"
5,Very Solid Dictionary,"The best Russian-English resource I have found outside of having an actual interpreter. The book is easy to navigate, does not dumb-down while providing adequate examples and phraseology to illustrate the usage of each term with a focus on high-use words. The Russian-English equivalent to the outstanding Kodansha Japanese-English Furigana dictionary."
5,dictionary extraordinaire,I love it. This dictionary beats all the old ones I used to have. It has all the cases for the nouns in the front. It has current American English and Russian. Haven't NOT found a word yet!
4,"Strong on vocabulary, weak on usage","I found the book very helpful for translating words. However, there's much to be desired with regards to how to use the words. Not enough information on grammar (cases taken, etc.). But very good for basic vocabulary."
3,A good dictionary with a fragile binding,"This is an excellent dictionary, but it has a fragile binding that is not suitable for a tome like this. What was Wiley thinking about when they selected the materials for this volume? The binding of my copy split in half after less than two years of usage and pages started falling out before that time. For a product that costs this much, I expected somthing that can actually be used for a long time. I advised Wiley of the problem and they stood behind the product. I received a replacement volume at no charge. Recommended."
2,"For the price, I expected better","For a dictionary priced in the same vicinity as the Oxford Russian-English, Katzner fails to deliver the quality. Grammatical forms are, as a rule, not provided. Idiomatic examples are paltry. Worst of all, Katzner perpetuates some of the mistranslations from the Soviet-era Smirnitsky, from which he evidently copied uncritically. Katzner is adequate for most students, but if you're willing to settle for a dictionary that will often leave you high and dry and at times mislead you entirely, why not choose one of the much cheaper mass-produced titles? Why pay Oxford prices for Berlitz quality?"
3,Chosen by the Defense Language Institute...,"and other reasons not to buy this book. It has its place and, in general, is not a bad dictionary for a begining Russian student. I relied on it through both the Basic and Intermediate Russian courses at DLI and even managed to get a hard-cover version in Minsk. I too would have said, ""great dictionary"" until I got hold of the Muller/Smirnitsky combo and got to where I could understand the entries in Ozhegov. If you're serious about learning Russian, nothing less than Smirnitsky will do. Keep Katzner and Oxford on hand but don't go to them first. Also consider investing in a Daum and Schenk Russian Verbs dictionary if you are worried about participles and verb government/usage. I have yet to find anything better."
2,An expensive disappointment,"Lack of grammar forms, laconic definitions, and flat-out errors mar this much-touted ""first Russian dictionary for Americans."" The Defense Language Institute does a disservice in handing this out to military linguists... and leaving their supervisors and senior linguists to pick up the pieces down the line. Don't waste your money - hie thee to an Oxford!"
3,Could be better,"While, thus far, I've found this dictionary very suitable for my needs (I'm writing an archaeology dissertation and have to read through some Russian documents that have a lot of technical osteological terms), it's not the easiest to use. When one looks up a verb for example in the Engish to Russian section, only the imperfective aspect is given. Thus one has to look up the imperfective verb aspect in the Russian to English section to find the perfective aspect. In addition, for nouns ending in the soft sign, the English to Russian section does not give whether that noun is masculine or feminine. In order to ascertain this, again one must consult the Russian to English section. The lack of a Cyrillic Alphabet in Alphabetical order for quick reference is also frustrating. And I'm sure the lack of a Latin Alphabet in Alphabetical order is likewise frustrating for native Russian speakers."
2,A real disappointment,"When I saw that this dictionary was based on ""American English"", I was excited to get it. But save your money, or, better yet, use it to buy the Oxford Russian Dictionary. You can easily cope with British spelling (e.g. centre) and you'll find a much more useful dictionary. I find it remarkable that a modern (1994) dictionary purporting to be based on American English completely omits words such as ""Internet"", ""download"", ""e-mail"", to say nothing of all the acronyms associated with computers. Incidentally, you can find them all in the Oxford!"
5,The best Russo-English dictionary,"I have used this dictionary for a long time. My Russian teacher, Maryanne Ozernoy recommended this to our class. It is written by someone who deals with Russians and speaks the Russian language. I am no longer in a Russian class, but this book allows me to speak and expand my ability in the Russian language."
5,Very Good & Useful,"I like this dictionary very much. It has been a good companion since I began learning Russian. I have found, that once I got down the letters and some basic words, I wanted to look up the words for things before I got to those things in my grammar books. Also, when watching a tv show that has some Russian in it, I like to try and figure out how to spell what they have said and then look it up. Also, I used this book to look up the names of things in my house, I then labeled those items with their Russian word, and this helped me to quickly add words to my vocabulary. If you are going to try and learn Russian, I strongly recommend you go ahead and buy this dictionary at the beginning, as it makes the learning experience a lot more fun."
4,english-russian dictionary,"The dictionary has nearly every word I searched for in it. In addition it gives several derivatives of words with multiple meanings, a handy informational item. When used with a phrase book you can write meaningful letters to your friend in Russian. I would say buy it if you are corresponding to a Russian."
5,A must have!,"This is a great - an indispensable - reference for anyone learning Russian and for advanced speakers too. Advanced speakers would have other reference books also, but I'm sure that this dictionary cannot be outgrown. The layout is excellent with declensions for adjectives, conjugation hints, and imperfective/perfective shown for verbs. A great help for serious students."
5,This is a MUST buy for the Russian learner!,"This is the best dictionary for Americans studying Russian... no question about it. I am currently majoring in Russian Language and Literature and often find myself turning to its pages to clarify words and their uses.I paid forty dollars for this book at a retail store. To get it for twenty something dollars is a no brainer, you must buy this dictionary!"
5,Simply Perfect; Only imperfection not a pocket size -- otherwise: THIS IS THE ONE,"I'm usually a verbose reviewer. Here there is no need to be. The Russian teacher's review is accurate. But let's just be simple, here: this dictionary -- other than not being a pocket size -- is absolute perfection in every aspect of a dictionary in general and a bilingual dictionary in particular. ""Mirroring"" is perfect. Comprehensiveness is excellent. Subtle-distinction capture is there. I could go on, but I promised to not be verbose. Unless you need to carry a dictionary with you in your pocket, there is no reason to pick any other Russian-English/English-Russian dictionary. This is the one!"
3,A student of Russian,"Overall, I found this to be the best Russian-English dictionary that I have used to date. However, I think its worth a note that it does not fare well with regular use. I used mine as a reference for my russian courses for less than one year and the binding split in two. Now all of the pages are falling out, which I find a bit frustrating. In my opinion, reference books should be durable, as they are meant to be used regularly, and this dictionary just didn't hold up. Given the price, I was fairly disappointed with the quality."
1,"Content 5, Binding 0","I have no argument with the content of this dictionary; it serves most of my needs. But I like to mark up my books and make notes in the margins; these help me remember things over the years. But after 1 1/2 years of use, this ""perfect bound"" dictionary is falling apart. It has no signatures, no threaded binding, so the pages that are merely glued in tend to fall out after repeated opening and closing of the book. This type of binding is acceptable on a short cheap paperback novel that you'll read one time, but on a thousand-page dictionary that you want to consult for years?! Language dictionaries are opened and closed thousands of times and must have the best of binding. This has the worst and all my notes are now lost for all practical purposes as I must change to a new intact dictionary. I'm sorry for Katzner, ... Not recommended."
4,Choice for the price,Great dictionary a lot of words and descriptions.Weak side - an absence of transcriptions for English words.Good choice to learn Russian for English speaking people but not vice versa.
3,so-so,"This dictionary doesn't have pronunciation transcription, for example in any other dictionaries, if you look word DEBT, you can see the transcription how to pronounce it: [det] . When you know how to pronounce, then you can remember this word (add to your vocabulary).Also even though it says that this dictionary based on American English, I looked if I can find some very simple words, and I couldn't find many words. For example look Russian word 'stranniy', you get translation 'strange', 'odd'. But not 'weird', why? Americans are using 'weird' as much as 'strange'."
2,totally not worth the price,"before ordering this dictionary I should have read more thoroughly negative reviews-had I done this I would have saved time and a little of money (amazon deducted 4 dollars from the refund). I don't like this dictionary at all. its biggest disadvantage is that it doesnt have phonetic pronunciation!! I am rather fluent in English, but there are still some words the pronunciation of which I would like to know-and this dictionary can't help at this point.I would forgive this dictionary its bulkiness, poor vocabulary but I cant forgive the absence of phonetic pronunciation.I would not recommend this dictionary"
4,Does the job well,This is a well produced reference book on the Russian / english - English / Russian dynamic.There are of course many choices on such books in the field. I bought this one and was happy with the choice.
3,Katzner English-Russian dictionary,"Very good, because it is American-Russian compared to English-Russian. Binding is not the greatest, but biggest shortfall is that American slang is not included, nor common earthy words that are widely used in American Lexicon, so I would say that its approach is a bit Victorian in a 21st century world."
5,A HUGE Help with the Potty Training Process,"I started the potty training process a little later than most....my daughter is 3, and wasn't showing any interest in using the toilet. I ended up buying this sticker book and it really made a huge difference. She was so excited to get a sticker and put it on the calendar. And, as an added bonus, when she fills an entire row, she gets a reward (she decided her reward should be 1 Rolo. Since she barely ever gets candy, I thought I got off easy). She had a couple of accidents the first 3 days, but after that, she's been great. We just finished completing all 126 stickers and I decided to get another book! I also REALLY recommend putting your child in underwear (vs pull-ups) when starting the process. I noticed when I had her in the pull-up, she would ""use"" it. Once I made the switch to underwear, she really felt the difference and made sure to tell me when she had to go!"
4,"Good training tool, especially if your kids love stickers","My daughter loves stickers, and this was a good tool. We are still working on it, but its been pretty effective, we are on row 3"
2,A lot there but they're no good,It came with a lot of stickers but I thought the stickers were very small and had stupid images. I was creeped out by the images with real children heads on cartoon bodies - I thought it was too creepy to give to my daughter!
3,A little disappointed,"The stickers are not what I expected. They are very small and hard for a toddler to handle. My toddler is independent and wants to do everything herself, including taking the stickers out of the book. Thank goodness this wasn't a costly item."
4,A Great Motivational Tool,"We have been trying to get my daughter potty trained since she was two years old. We started because she showed interest in the potty, but she has not been consistant. We purchased many ""potty books"" so we could reinforce the importance of using the potty, and to give her something to do while she was sitting on the potty. However, our approach was lacking the motivation to keep her consistantly trying to use the potty on a regular basis. This book provides that motivation. It is a book of 126 stickers with a fun chart which maps out my daughter's progress. She loves the variety of fun stickers, which are definately original and found no where else but this book. We just got this book, and I hope that in two months, at age three, she will be on her way to ""big girl undies."""
3,Waste for a girl who is refusing to potty-train,"My daughter didn't want to potty-train because our lives were so hectic. New home, a recent move, and a new baby. She was physically ready to potty-train, but not emotionally so she was refusing to potty-train. I tried this book for her to see if I could motivate her, but she refused.Eventually, my daughter became potty-trained with outside help. Her playgroup teacher took one day to potty-train her. My daughter played with the stickers, but the chart was useless.I would suggest that if your child is not completely ready to potty-train, don't buy all these extras. If your child is ready and you just want some little rewards to help, this would be fine."
1,A big disappointment,"I assumed these stickers would be geared towards younger (toddler-aged) children. My daughter will be 2 in November & these seemed way too ""old"" for her. I was disappointed."
3,My daughter didn't respond to it.,"My daughter could not have cared less about these stickers during potty training. Once she finally felt like it, she started using the potty- being in pre-school and seeing her friends do it made much more of an impact- but every child is different- maybe it will work for your child."
1,Potty Reward Stickers for Girls,I was disappointed with the sticker choices. I didn't think they were very appropriate for early potty training. My granddaughter did not seem particularly thrilled about receiving them. I thought they were overpriced for what you received.
4,Rewards Stickers are Motivating,I had a really good response from my 2 1/2 year old using these potty stickers. She looks forward to adding one to the chart everytime she uses the toilet. It really made potty training easier!!
4,"Fun, motivating stickers!","2 full pages of original, potty-themed stickers and a handy chart to put them on! My daughter loves to look over all the stickers and pick one out while she's sitting on her potty. At 2 yrs old, it doesn't really matter what's on the sticker (she loves ANY kind of sticker!) but the varied pictures of potties, toilet paper, and big girl panties make it extra fun for her to talk about these things and feel proud of her accomplishments. She's just completed her first row on the chart! :-)"
5,Potty Training Fun,My daughter LOVES stickers and band-aids. Anything she can decorate herself with!! She loves receiving a sticker for trying out her new potty!! We decided not to put the stickers on the chart and to just give them to her. We use her favorite color crayon to color in the chart instead. it's fun for her and rewarding!! It gives her something to look forward to!! GREAT IDEA!!
5,Great Motivator!,"I just started working with my 2 year old daughter on potty training. I am using this book as positive reinforcement and it is working great! We have it hanging in the bathroom and everytime she uses the potty she gets to add another sticker to the chart. It is helping to motivate her because she really looks forward to putting up that next sticker! I like the pictures and phrases on the stickers because they are potty related and I can encourage her according to the sticker she picks out. I recommend this book for anyone who is potty training. So far, the results are great for us."
2,"Really, really, really big waste of money.",Seemed like it would be a good idea but my daughter was over it within 1 day. Not worth the money in my opinion.
4,One of my favourites!,"If you love to use the slow cooker, this is a great little cookbook w/ several amazing recipes. Ingredients are simple, recipes are quick, and layout is convenient. I was surprised by all the negative reviews, this book instantly became one of my favourites and I've recommended it to several people. Several recipes use vegan meats, so it's a great cookbook to have around for convincing non-vegans!"
1,Almost Anyone Could Write This,"First of all, the woman blabs on forever! That is how I ended up with this book in the first place - I stupidly bought the Kindle edition even though the preview NEVER got to a recipe. Secondly, as someone above me said this is for someone who is just starting out into cooking - vegetarian, vegan, or otherwise. Also, as a long time vegan who has lived in multiple states, I must say I have never seen canned vegan mushroom gravy. Could be out there, but BLECCH."
2,Didn't care for any of the recipes.,"I'm not a terribly picky eater, but I couldn't find a single recipe worth trying. This book ended up in the garbage. blah"
2,Am I doing something wrong?,"I follow the recipes in the book to the letter, and so far I am 0.5 for 4 [one soup wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting].I don't know if it is rife with mis-measurements, or what the problem is, but I haven't enjoyed the 4 recipes I've tried so far.I've got two more recipes dog-earred, and I hope they delight and can change my mind, but until then I can't recommend this book.[If they do work out, I'll amend my review, of course]."
4,Simple is as simple does,"Nothing fancy here, but if you need a few quick slow-cooker recipes always on hand, well, here you go. I especially like the stuffed peppers. I found this did the trick as far as comfort food that reminded me of my dear old mum.As for the real cook, why would you need a cookbok anyway? Go to culinary school. Open a restaurant where people - including a deer-hunting grandfater - actually want to eat."
1,Special K,This book is not up to standards for a cookbook. I paid for this book to included the Author's autograph. It came with initials. There was money wasted. I am not impressed with the contents of the book either. Very disappointed. Do not buy this book!
2,Unimpressive,"As a vegan for almost 10 years, and someone who loves to cook, I am constantly searching for new cookbooks. While the recipes in this book were easy to follow, the few that I tried did not taste very good. I tried four of the recipes, being faithful to the instructions. The recipes seemed to rely on an overdose of spices. I was not impressed. Simple, yes. Tasty, no."
4,"Subtle smell, low-suds lather, rinses clean","I came to natural soaps later in life, and this soap is an example of why I did. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering or perfumey. It doesn't smell a lot like either tangerine or grapefruit... inasmuch as you might expect it to have a Jolly Rancher flavor smell. At first I was disappointed by this, but as I use it day-by-day, I'm glad for the subtlety. The bar is big enough that you might want to cut it in half... another reason for this is that it goes soft (even on a drainage rack) after a week or so... it doesn't develop that gelatin layer that many soft soaps do, though. The lather isn't really sudsy, but lathered skin is somewhat slippery, almost slimy with a bit of grit. More pleasant than I'm making it sound, and it rinses clean and leaves a nice feel on the skin."
1,Pee-ewww!,"I was looking for a nice, strong tangerine smell or a nice, strong grapefruit smell, but this soaps smells really bad. I don't care that it's handmade or natural or whatever it is."
2,Won't be renewing,"I have been a subscriber for about 6 or 7 years. As a long-time business owner I used to love this magazine and read it cover to cover. Sadly, in the last couple of years the content has become increasingly juvenile, pointedly left-leaning, and (in my opinion) out of touch with traditional entrepreneurial American business values. It's a shame, because they used to have an awesome mag.About the only part of the magazine I still find interesting is the weekly book review section.Bottom line, I won't be renewing next month when my subscription ends."
1,Very political,This magazine used to be an informative read but has since the buyout by Bloomberg turned into a political magazine for left wing viewpoints. Am sadly going to cancel after many years.
3,You Could Do Better,"After several years, I am giving up by BW subscription. The magazine is getting pretty light - and reminds me more of USA Today than the New York Times. The articles are pretty general and lack depth. Additionally, the magazine is very US-centric and often limits global coverage. It is a good light read for US business news, and if you aren't looking for great depth, might be a good choice. For my money, I would rather pay up for the Economist and Fortune."
1,Disappointing,"Businessweek was once a great magazine for an in depth business analysis!!Since Bloomberg took over, it went down the drain...Bigger,but the contents are very superficial, no analysis, just reporting the news, might as well watch CNN! Did cancel my subscripition."
1,No longer a business magazine,"Having subscribed for well over a decade, I can speak to the fundamental changes that have been made since Bloomberg acquired it. First, to it's credit (I guess) it's revamped the look and feel to address the short attention span of the Twitter and texting generation. Smart business move, as that's what it must take in the world of print media to thrive. Personally, I find all the graphics and margin art to be annoyingly juvenile. Second, it has expanded the scope and tone of coverage to become little more than a media outlet for the DNC. It's added commentary on politics and policy, and has a section called the Bloomberg View that consistently articulates policy arguments from one side of the debate only. It really should change its name to more honestly reflect its new propagandist mission."
1,Not what it used to be,This used to be my favorite magazine. I have been a subscriber for years. Unfortunately since Bloomberg bought it has gone straight down hill. It is becoming more and more of a political magazine and less and less dealing with business. The political comment is strictly liberal.When my subscription expires I will not be renewing. The bottom line is if you like liberal politics then this is the magazine for you. If you want business coverage you will need to look elsewhere.
2,Turned off by Increasingly political focus,"For years BW was my favorite magazine because it was unique in presenting the business news in a politically neutral context. The last two years or so have seen more and more political commentary slip into the articles, most notably, cheerleading for the Obama Administration while ridiculing anyone who disagrees with it. If I want that sort of analysis, there are dozens of other periodicals I can subscribe to. When my current subscription runs out, I will look for another publication that gives me straight business information without trying to convince me who the heroes and villains are."
4,very good magazine at a very good price,excellent business and economics magazine with little political bias. In depth articles and has helped me to understand investing well.
1,Business Week Year in Review,The year-end double issue has to be the worst magazine ever published in the history of the world. I fully agree with other recent reviewers; Bloomberg has ruined a fine publication that I've subscribed to for many years. I'll not be renewing.
1,Political rag,"I won't even take it to the gym for others to read. Pushes a liberal, global political agenda. What a waste of money for the liberal friend who paid for the subscription, thinking I could be won-over."
2,Giving up on Business Week,I've been a subscriber for over 30 years and the magazine went down hill after Bloomberg took it over. As another reader mentioned it's like USA Today but I think it's a combination of USA Today and People Magazine. Where did all the news go?
3,An OK supplement,"I use this magazine to give me a business-specific supplement to my reading of The Economist. That said they are two very different magazines. I like to think that The Economist calls issues down the middle and is conservative in their format, while Bloomberg seems to be a bit liberal and the format of the magazine makes you think they're out for some editorial award. After subscribing for two years, I don't think I will renew. I think that one can find almost all of the information offered in the issues for free on the web at one source or another. Additionally It seems that a key strategy of the magazine is to sell a 'shock' factor on the cover, not that this doesn't work, it just that that is not the kind of publication that I want to be relying on for my news."
2,More style than substance,"It's not the old BW, and this is not a good thing.Articles tend to be a mile wide and an inch deep. The publishers seem to put far to much emphasis on trying to be ""artsy"" with weird layouts, colors, and graphics which at times render the articles almost unreadable,Will not be renewing."
1,BW is not what it used to be,"I have been a BW subscriber since junior year of high school, over 9 years ago. Since the sale to the Bloomberg group reading this magazine has become unbearable. BW was always cheap to subscribe to and always kept me in the know, but now all I would get is basic news coverage and no indepth stories or analysis. Even the tech guy who I liked to much has been let go. I guess Bloomberg can flex its news muscle and just aggregate the BW content from their news sources, but experienced readers will realize that the stories are lacking the overall quality we came to expect. I have cancelled my subscription and received my refund. Economist subscription costs twice as much, but at this point this is the only quality consistent alternative that I am aware of. Big does not mean better, at least not in the Bloomberg Business Week situation."
2,A Classic gone astray - will not renew,"This has been my favorite business magazine and I've continuously subscribed to it for the past 15 years. The articles were indepth, intelligent, and thoughtfully written. And its business technology coverage was stellar.Unfortunately, I fully agree the the recent reviewer comments that it is now a completely animal since Bloomberg took over it a year ago. The change is akin to what happened to Coke when New Coke was introduced...a disaster! It is now colorful (as in, it will give you dizzies!), superficial in coverage, and completely lacks depth. It reads like a magazine written for 17 year olds who might lack an attention span to read a 5 page story! It was a classic that's gone astray. I'll not be renewing my subscription. I would recommend The Economist as an imperfect alternative. Although, it will not live up to the high bar set by the pre-Bloomberg-era BusinessWeek."
1,Extremely left leaning,"This magazine is delivered for free to our house because my husband is taking MBA classes and he gets a free subscription as a student. Even though it's free, I STILL canceled it! It's not a true business magazine. It has a very obvious left-leaning agenda, which is very odd for a business magazine. I'm am open to reading different points of view, but for a business magazine, I want straight reporting, not with a political bias. The most recent issue was about Obama winning re-election. Half the magaine was about how the Republican party is doomed. It didn't have one positive thing to say about Romney. Even NY Magazine had a positive Jeb Bush article. As a business owner, I want a true business magazine, not a shell for the Dem. party."
3,Dot Com Revisted,"I quit my subscription of Businessweek after the dot-com crash. Articles leading up to the crash seemed to rationalize the ""new economy."" Who came up with the concept of a new economy, driven by ""information"" instead of profits. Snake oil sales. Two weeks ago I picked up an issue about the housing crises, and I thought it sounded more down-to-earth reporting, but they don't offer much of a contrarian opinion, and I think they missed catching a nice market bounce. If you're looking for investment ideas, I would use Businessweek as a good contrarian indicator, when they say it's hot, get ready to get out. If they say it's cold, take a second look."
5,nice magazine,Son-in-law enjoys reading....beat the lowest price I could find by $10.00....still waiting to start delivery....hopefully any day now.
2,Business Week is hiring journalism school grads,"And is leaning more to the left with every issue. This very week, 25 JUL 2011, the magazine opens with a piece by Michael Kinsley, adducing liberal clap-trap about the debt-ceiling situation. I see a bit of left-slant in most of the features... writers writing about the businesses that fuel American commerce, but always with a degree of disdain or antagonism. Biting the hands that feed them... and feed our nation. I'm going to let my subscription lapse, when it runs out."
5,enjoyable insight,B.B. is a great resource for students and citizens who want to be informed. Very interesting read. Well written- insightful and not too dry.
2,Gone Downhill Fast,"Under Bloomberg this magazine has gone down hill. It reads and looks more like the gossipy, splashy, shallow, New York Magazine than a business magazine. It also tilts left wing in it's content and opinion. Pro union, pro taxes, pro green, pro big government solutions for everything, Democratic talking points all. I can't trust it anymore, it seems very agenda driven. Don't plan on renewing my subscription."
2,News Not Views,I find the magazine too light on opinion and analysis. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it looks more like USA Today. I wish there was a magazine that is a cross between Economist and BW.
2,Not renewing my subscription since Bloomberg changes.,"I've subscribed to this magazine for many many years and considered it a great way to get accurate information about both business and significant world events. I've even given gift subscriptions to friends and family.But since Bloomberg took over, I find the organization of the magazine (not even page numbers) seems almost random, many of the types of articles I liked the most are no longer published. It is really a different magazine altogether.I stuck with it for the remainder of my subscription to see if it would improve. It didn't. It's very disappointing as I always looked forward to reading the magazine but I did not renew. And I haven't found anything to replace it.Buy this magazine at the newsstand for a month or take the short subscription and see what you think before making a longer commitment."
4,Enjoyable Business Magazine,As a retired engineer I enjoy this magazine which has a good coverage of business topics and innovations without going into minute analysis.One annoying aspect is that the magazine designers sometimes get carried away with the colored ink art... making it a little difficult for this senior citizen to read.
5,JEN ROCKS,I have been a Jen fan for a while now and this is her best music to date. She is a very talented songwrite that knows how to reach her audience. One listen and I was hooked and so will you.
2,WONDER BREAD,"I purchased this CD based on the recommendation of the previous reviewer and the short snipits provided by Amazon. After two listens this one went into the garbage bin. While this artist has talent, the banal repetitive vocals and musical arrangements remind me of elevator music. Lyrically this woman has something to say and would benefit from an innovative producer.In short, SAVE YOUR MONEY for new music by Cindy Bullens, Michelle Shocked, Brandi Carlisle or Shannon McNally."
3,"Won't break, might break your hand","Unless your dog is perfect on the leash and you like this for the style, this is a very bad plan. If you need to grab the leash for extra control you will hurt yourself.A normal nylon leash wont break - that's what they make seat belts and climbing gear out of!"
3,pretty good sub rescue film,"When we watched this, I was sure that it was a made-for-TV movie: nice while you're watching it, but definitely throwaway material. There are strong characters and a good script, with personal clashes, authority conflicts, and humorous friction - probably the best aspect of the film. The rescue preparations are also pretty good, and realistic so far as I can tell. But that is as far as the action goes: a rescue, run by driven, competent men, that appears realistically feasible. After 2 hours, regardless of the moments of suspense, it felt pretty thin."
3,"'70s disaster movie, submarine style","---------------------------------------------------""Gray Lady Down""(Universal Pictures, 1978)---------------------------------------------------This film, released in 1978, is very much a product of its time, headlined by Charlton Heston and packed with Me-Decade character actors such as Ned Beatty, David Carradine, Ronny Cox and Stacy Keach (with a pre-Superman Christopher Reeve appearing in minor role...) Though faithful in its depiction of Navy protocol, ""Gray Lady Down"" belongs more to the 'Seventies ""disaster movie"" fad than to the military movie genre -- it's a slow-moving, methodical view of a high-stakes, deep-water rescue that takes place when an American sub is damaged and sinks to the ocean floor, teetering over the abyss as frantic rescue efforts are mounted above. Fans of submarine movies and ""Poseidon Adventure"" alike may enjoy this one, as well as students of '70s pop culture on the prowl for star-packed casts. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Movie Reviews)"
3,"[Three-and-a-half out of Four stars] Fine performances by Carradine, Heston, Beatty and look for Christopher Reeves (unbilled)","Very well made movie with all cast in theirprimes. A Norwegian Freighter hists Amer-I-can nuclear sub and it sinks to depth or1,400 ft. Carradine gives up ghost for subat end. Great supporting cast with manyHawai'i Five-0 vets aboard."
2,Good beach read,I personally like the books that she writes with her husbands better. This book is not very compelling and is a hard one to get into. Too much detail and not enough story. It is as though she wants to impress you with her acient tales of the tribes rather than about each character. I would either pass or buy used. Not worth the money for new.
3,Different Logo On Back,"I loved everything about the hat except that the logo on the back was of a ""paw"" and not the ""nittany lion"" that is shown on the image. I loved the nittany lion logo and am not a huge fan of the paw."
1,Lacking Utility,With hopes that I could interface my GPS315 with my pc and store trips that I had taken as well as set up my unit for new trips I ordered the DataSend software. I was quite dissapointed to find that it is ONLY a compilation of waypoints(landmarks as Magellan calls them). You can only put the landmarks into the GPS. It lacks the capability of storing data FROM the GPS which is very important for finding fishing spots or recording previous trips. I have found another product that I hope can do that (DataTrack) but thats not available on Amazon. Additionally the maps are not detailed enough to plan a trip. I wish I could return this product.
2,Worth having,"*UPDATE*I want to say I was much too harsh on this album. It is worth owning. While it is not the equal of 'Speakeasy', it stands pretty well on its own feet. The fact I am still listening to it five years later should count for something more than just the text of my review. I might also recommend 'How to Live with a Curse', their later release.----I admit to being both annoyed and disappointed enough to write my first online review.In short, I would avoid this album. Lyrically and musically 'Speakeasy' in every way exceeds (staves'a'ker), and should definately be recommended.My chief complaint is definitely lyrical, as no song on (staves'a'ker) seems to contain any great depth of faith or emotion which could be found in their previous albums and overall seems rather diluted and shallow."
2,"A longtime Stavesacre fan, but...","I persist in not being enthralled with this album. Not too say I won't listen to it, its just so conventional. Its ""new rock"". Lots of preprocessed guitar and the like. The first song reminds me of ""A Perfect Circle"" (although thats really a good thing). The rest is also very derivative of just about every mainstream rock act out there. There are a few good tracks, but the album is generally unsatisfying. I feel like Stavesacre has used its ""coming out"" album not to distinguish itself from the pack, but to join it. Very disappointing."
5,"Buy this, ...","... This is a great album!! When I first popped it into my CD player, I was like, ""Wow, this sounds great!"" but the more I listen to it the more I like, correction, love it! Track 2, ""Blind Hope"" is one of my favorite songs on there. The mellowness of the album is conceled in its raw power which is strongly backed by the incredible voice of Mark Solomon and the incredible talent of Sam West on the drums. The songs are engaging and have incredible lyrics that speak straight to the heart. These are the songs that get me through the hard times. All thier previous albums are excellent and this one follows in suit by maintaining the heart and the quality that Stavesacre has put into thier music..."
5,Finally A Book That promotes freedom of personality,"As a salesman and sales trainer I have been through numerous sales training methods. Most, if not all, attempt to fit everyone into the same cookie cutter mold. Newman and Doyle, however smash that mold. They simple genius that each person is different and that one liner ""closes"" and ""long list of questions"" may not work for everyone equally is fully explored and explained with alternative options that compliment each individual personality. If you are in sales...THIS IS A MUST READ!"
5,Works Great!,"I bought this self inflatable cushion for use in my kayak. I have not yet used it in my kayak yet, but I have been using it in different seats around the house, truck etc. It seems to be very well made and durable. The latching strap is a nice touch. It does ""self inflate"" kinda....with a little squishing and pulling...!! I have found it much easier to just twist the valve open and blow into it until the desired size is reached, then just twist the valve closed. It blows up pretty thick too, so unless you're just huge, I wouldn't worry about it being not enough padding. I am 6'2 190lbs and I find that I don't need it even close to all the way inflated. For the price and prime shipping, I'm very pleased with the purchase.UPDATE: I have since used the cushion in my kayak, and LOVE it! It works perfectly! My only regret is not getting it sooner. I officially change my rating to 5 stars. IMO this cushion is a MUST HAVE for anyone who sits in a kayak for more than an hour at a time!"
5,excellent product!,"excellent product! Highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and great value. I'll definitely be back for more great deals! thank you"
3,"It's OK, could be better","I do alot of hiking while deer and elk hunting in Oregon. I needed something smaller when rolled up and QUIET while I stalk. I think this product be could smaller if it was more rounded and have it be outlined or made with something quieter if I want to keep it on my hips while hunting. This is loud hard endura. Fine for recreational use but not for stalking going through brush. I thought about rolling it up, but it will take up all the room in my fanny pack. Also, the cusion could be a little thicker when infalted and the valve needs to be repositoned, so when you sit down its in between your legs for easy adjustment. (yes Allen company or others, I will want royaltees on that if you change it)"
2,The plastic covers are not shiny like you see on the picture,The plastic covers are not shiny like you see on the picture. Mine's not polished. I would really get the traditional solid color if I knew it'd be like this. The knife itself is fine. All the tools are working fine. Just it looks kind of hideous. I use it as a tool not an eye candy so i didn't return for another. So beware!
4,Great story of faith,This is the true story of the Cardinal and his survival of maltreatment at the hands of the Vietnamese Communists. His faith and his perseverance are truly inspiring.
1,Computer Desk,"This product was AWFUL,TERRIBLE...HATED IT. A TOTAL WASTE of MONEY!!! Took forever to receive it, pieces missing, instructions hard to read, wheels already broke off. >:-["
2,Work Station Review,"The price of this workstation was good. It wasn't obvious that the metal frame was of such thin guage that you could actually bend it when tightening screws. The instructions were barely decipherable. When completed the first thought is; could I rework some of the frame, with metal purchased elsewhere, to make it stronger? The design and size is perfect for my application - used by children who are just ready to enter middle school. It is unfortunate that is is made of such cheap materials."
2,Not Much Here,"This is just for completists or if you're scoring a movie set in Italy in 1960's, this might be the 20th CD you want to pick up for research but otherwise, there's not much here.It's a random collection of solid, professional Italian film scores (presumably) for action and thrillers. There are no tracks that can stand on their own for separate listening and there is no mistaking them for anything but soundtrack scores.For most listeners, sounds intrguing but not much here."
4,"Nice, but could've been so much more.",This is great for Marquette die-hards but it could've been better. The interviews are thrown together so it's like hearing one side of a conversation. There's little exposition or writing to weave the stories together.
4,Fast shipping,Very fast shipping! The book came as described (NEW) and I saved about $15 from buying it from Amazon.com
2,Weak attempt to get young readers thinking,"This book is boring! The author does try to get the reader to categorize (e.g., how many of the creatures in the house can open cupboards?), but some of the questions are confusing to kids. For example, the cupboards question pages show that the two adults and the two cats can open them, but not the child. HA! The author must not have ever been around normal children..."
2,"Confusing, disjointed","Although I'm a man who is sympathetic to the feminist movement, I found this book confusing and disjointed."
1,Don't bother,"I didn't care for it. The constant shifts in perspective were disorienting. It mocked & criticized, without even suggesting solutions. I think some of the metaphor was too subtle for me (why is Whileaway surrounded and protected by giant talking gnats? I just don't get it) and that turned me off. The only ""masculine"" traits the author seemed to recognize were short temper and heartless & vicious violence. The only character close to likeable and human is Janet, but even she comes across as flat and dispassionate. Some parts were funny, but I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Arcane pleasures,"After reading this book, you will never clip your toenails again without marvelling at the fine and delicate engineering that went into the noble toenail clipper. You will develop a nostalgia for flipping through the card catalog, and for the days when consumer items did not come in fashion colors and an overwhelming number of forms. We are unaccustomed to the results of such honed and loving attention paid to the quotidian. Who knew such pleasure could be gotten from the history of film projectors, or the semantic evolution of the word ""lumber?"""
4,Wow!,"A weirdly eclectic mix of topics, each of which stays with you.The essay on card catalogs makes me want to scream and tear my hair out. I have a few friends who are librarians. I have raised Baker's issue with them, and they are to-a-t EXACTLY how he would have predicted. ""Well, we're not really archivists.""Wonderful, compelling stuff here."
3,A mixed bag,"Credit where it's due, there's a sense in which this collection of essays merits a 5-star rating: it displays the author's impressive breadth of learning; it is, throughout, terrifically well written; it is interesting, if for no other reason, for its unconventionality. NB is a very fine essayist. Then why only 3 stars? Simply because my attention wasn't held from start to finish. There are some brilliant essays in this collection. And there are some less engaging pieces. Depends what you're interested in, I guess. Perhaps no one besides NB shares all of NB's interests. But each of NB's interests is probably shared by some reader(s) out there. So, it's probably safe to say that TSoT has something for 'everyone'. I'm glad I read it, and I'd definitely read NB again."
3,The essay on card catalogs is exemplary.,The rest is not up to that standard. Baker is too often obviously satisfied with his own cleverness; the effect is annoying.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I've read and enjoyed other works by Baker (The Fermata, Vox), but this collection of magazine articles is absolute rubbish. Random musings on arcane topics such as fingernail clippers, cinema projectors and model airplanes not only fail to entertain, they appear to have no redeeming value whatsoever.Baker is without question a talented writer, but this collection aptly demonstrates that even the best author needs adequate subject matter with which to work. I'm stunned at just how bad this collection actually is. The first time I've ever awarded a one star rating."
1,Puny Thoughts,"The world is full of whiners, and this guy is the king. As a pup, Nicholson Baker attended the School Without Walls where, ""learning has no limit."" Unfortunately for us, the only message he got resulted in his permanent low self-image.If you purchase ANY of this poor misbegotten soul's books, you are doing nothing more than feeding the mouth of a permanent pessimist.Nicholson, we're praying for you and your children."
1,not recommended,"After reading it I quickly sold it off. Price action setup with limited predictive ability. Just download his ""Law of Charts"" info, available everywhere."
4,Pricey but it works,"We recently had to use our RV's generator for several hours when the campground lost power. After a while generator exhaust fumes seeped in through the slide opening. After that experience we ordered the Gen-Turi which works as advertised and was easy to install. My only problem is that at $104 (best price I could find)it seems a bit pricey for 3 pieces of plastic tubing, clamp, a right angle metal pipe and adapter."
5,Attaches easily and works like it should,"Ordered this for a customer, since our local distributors were either sold out or out of stock. Arrived very quickly and installed in a matter of minutes. Customer was very happy with the product and it works exactly as described. Would definitely recommend and will be purchasing more in the near future. Thank you."
4,Hope you never a part...,"Over all the Gen Turi works well. I decided that I'll get an extra strap for the top part of the pipe. I was suprized to find out that the company who makes the product dose not sell to the general public, wholesale only! I enquired about where a dealer was so I could get an extra strap and did did not have an answer. I can't imagine what would happen if I needed an adapator."
3,Not what I expected!,Does not divert the noise very well but does help with fumes. I ordered it mostly for noise so I am not very happy.
4,Works fine,"Product works as described, fits well. Would have been nice to know that an extension might have been needed to make it to the top of our coach (Fleetwood Discovery)"
2,Dangerous,Exhaust goes into the roof vents if they're open and the wind blows it into the motor home. I keep mine open most of the time so it's useless. I guess it would be OK if all the roof vents are closed.
5,RV Exhaust Venting System,"Item works great. Use it in ""Dry Camping"" situations. Reduces inside RV generator exhaust noise as well as fumes. Reduces the possibility of grass fires from starting from hot exhaust from diesel generator. Easy to install and dismantle. Excellent instructions provided. Very responsive manufacturer on technical questions. Highly recommend the product."
4,Definately a very good product,"We live in Beavercreek Ohio and unfortunatly have an old antiquated electrical supply system and lose power numerous times per year. We use the generator on our RV to supply power to keep the refrigerator and freezer going during extended outages. We try to use the RV to watch TV and to provide a cool atmosphere in the summer time. However, most of the time exhaust gases from the generator make it uninhabitable. We purchased the gen-turi vertical exhaust system and now can stay in the RV and not have the noxious and dangerous exhaust enter the RV living area. Money well spent."
5,Happy Camper,The black pipe does not get more than warm. You can grab it and no big deal where as I have seen skin peal off of a person that leaned up against a home made version of this exhaust system.
1,Indy as a G-man,This book is one of the worse Indiana Jones books ever!....Indy is not a G-man or the leader of some elite strike force...He is an adventurer who is in search of archeology. In general buy the other books and stay away from this one
1,Awfull!!!Worst indy novel by far...!!!,"This book is the worst Indiana Jones novel i've read(and i've read them all).Caidin is by far the worst writer for indy adventure books(MaxMc Coy was the best,followed closely by McGregor).Even Caidins terrible ""white witch"" was better than this one(but not by far).Skip this one and buy the rest!!!"
1,Not A Indiana Jones Worthy Author,"I am an abid Indiana Jones Fan. I have read all 12 books in the series, and Martin Caidin has the worst 2 Indiana Jones books out there. I love the rest of them but Caidin should not have attempted these books. It has nothing to do with Indy's charachter whatsoever, and Martin just had to add his obsession of airplanes on every page of the book. Read all the Indy novel's but the two that Caidin wrote. He should have stuck to writing flight mauals, this was boring, two thumbs down. Caidin is most definatly not Indiana Jones worthy."
3,Just wasn't THAT great!,"My biggest complaint on this book is how far it goes from other Indy stories. It doesn't seem right at all, and I believed that the author made Indy more of a side character, he consintrated on the others too much, and left indy to be a stubborn intolerant person, that wasn't fitting. I also think the action level of the Sky Pirates was low. too many conversations, not enough adventure. Another let down of this book is the absence of Marcus Brody.Overall, It's a pretty good book...not too much of an Indy book though."
4,"A good book, but not necessarily a good Indy book.","I must say, Martin Caidin is a pretty good author. His characters are interesting, his plot is fast-paced, and his story is well developed. However, the book has one small flaw: The main character does not fit in with the type of story being told. While Caidin is ambitious by changing the genre in which Indy operates, and writes a pretty darn good book in the process, putting Indy in the middle of an international spy story just doesn't work."
5,Truly beautiful jewelry,"This is a bracelet that is prettier than the picture can show. It's just so shiny and goes with any outfit, dressy or casual. Wonderful purchase for the price. I'm never disappointed with Swarovski crystals and Gem Avenue products."
3,Inaccurate Product Description,"I was sent this item twice, having returned it the first time thinking it was missing attachments. In both instances, the rug cleaner came with only the tough stain attachment. The rest of the attachments listed in the product description are not included with this purchase. Also, in neither instance did I receive a ""Clearview"" model, although the second did come in a ""Proheat Clearview Plus"" box. I must state, however, that Amazon was wonderful to deal with and allowed me to return the items at no cost to me. A credit to my charge card appeared almost instantly. Amazon is a great company to deal with."
4,Review of factory reconditioned bissel steam cleaner,"A couple of years ago we took our carpets out and refinished the 50 year old hardwood floors on the main level of the house. The floor below we kept the carpet because of the concrete slab. I had an old bissel steam cleaner (round model) from 15 years back that was dying out. We now have a 1 year old maltese that is not nessarily fully potty trained, so we needed to upgrade our cleaner. A neighbor had the 7901 model and we used it a couple of times and it worked wonders. I wanted to purchase one but not at the full price in the store. I ended up buying the factory reconditioned model and am very pleased with it. It really cleans and extracts the water from the rug. I use the separate attachments in my cars and it works much better than the bissel little green. I have not tried any other models or brands because I have been pleased with bissel in the past. All in all it has been a great purchased."
4,Mine Works Just Fine,"My factory-reconditioned Bissell works just fine. I do agree that the ""turbo brush"" doesn't really do anything, however.I have used my steamer about once a month since I bought it last summer (2004), and I have never had any problems with it. I even use a natural cleaner in it so that I don't put chemicals into my carpet that could harm my son, and that has not caused any problems either.I do recommend that you perform the maintenance listed in the booklet because I see how problems could occur without proper maintenance, and it doesn't take a lot of effort to maintain this machine (mostly just rinsing off pieces that pop in and out). The most ""difficult"" task I have had in maintaining this machine was to unscrew the front of the unit to remove carpet fibers that had been sucked inside. It took less than 3 minutes total to do this.I have not tried it on hard floors.I really like this machine, and I recommend it!!"
2,It's Ok for carpets,"To keep the long story short: I own it for 6+ months, it works Ok for carpets to remove stains when using hand tool (get ready for hard work). Standard mode does not do much as well as TurboBrush works for marketing purposes only. As for hardfloor cleaning - this thing fails miserably (bare floor attachemnt does not help much eaither).As for chemicals - look for other brands. Bissel cleaning solutions are useless. I've tried Pink Solution and it works well, but remember to use hot water for SmartMix Tank on the last run - otherwise this chemical may cloak the system. Scotchgard is a joke - carpets stay cleaner without it.On the positive side - it is powerful and I really like the water tank idea - easy to replace and clean."
1,Belt broke on second use,I don't think I'd buy reconditioned again. The pump belt broke the second time I used the machine. The belt was in pieces and some of it was stuck to the shaft. I made the mistake of tossing the box after my first use. The machine is heavy and I don't know how I'll take it to be serviced.
1,Give up all hope,"It's not often I have to give up on a novel so quickly, but Finder: A Novel of the Borderlands has to qualify for one of the worst novels of the year. Nothing about it gripped me. It seems to think you can take fantasy tropes and give them a hard edged urban twist. In the end it just came across as a silly camp idea written with some of the most wooden characters I've come across outside of Pinocchio. I don't know about all the drugs it kept on going on about in a preachy type voice, but I had to reach for some good whiskey to counter writing this bad (and that was only after the first couple of chapters). Couldn't even recommend wasting your time on this is it was available as a free download for your Kindle."
5,Astounding,"I stumbled onto this book purely by chance. And I don't think there's anything I can say to properly prepare you for this book. Absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing, superb..... Just read it. You'll find out what I'm talking about. And, God, Tick-Tick...."
4,Trouble in the Borderlands,"Another Borderlands novel from Emma Bull, this one gives the reader new insight into the Borderlands. Bull's edgy book features characters whom you will care about and find interesting. It was as satisfying as War for the Oaks. When you finish with her Borderland books, try Will Shetterley's -- they feature some of the same characters."
5,wow. got a lot more than i expected,"thought it would just be a fun book to read, nothing gripping or plot wrenching like tolkien or brooks or other fantasy writers. then bam it hits you full on the mix of magic and tech sort of like rock, cafes, magic mixing. someplace that seems so real and desireable. the story i expected to be just a casual story turned out to have all the things i love in a sci fi/fantasy mixed in, in a new way. i just didn't expect it but boy it was great. if you read one bordertown story read finder."
1,The Fish Who Can't Swim,"Pull the string of this brightly colored fish, and . . .that's about all the fun you're going to have. The fish is supposed to speed across the water, but it just sits in one spot vibrating. My daughter and I were very disappointed."
1,I agree . . . this toy is disappointing!,"My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. She loves tub toys, but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water. My daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it ""swim"" on the floor. I'm a big fan of Sassy toys, but I'd pass on this one."
1,It doesn't work!,"Basically, whatever you do, the toy stands still in the bath. Everytime I try my son looks at me with pitty."
1,Not even worth 1 star,Terrible product. I bought this at Baby r us. I wished I bought it in Amazon. i will see all these negetive reviews. Not even worth a star if Sassy was giving it out for free.
1,So disappointing!,"When I saw this toy it looked like it would be alot of fun but when I put it in the tub with my 18 month old daughter and we pulled the tail to make it swim, (and it didn't) she handed it back to me. Not alot of fun."
4,Great read for a Mason or non-mason,"As a Mason, I am always interested in learning more about the ""craft"". This book is an interesting, well written description of Freemasonry.It covers the history of Masonry, from the operative lodges of the middle ages to the modern lodge as we know it today.The chapters on the role of Freemasonry in the founding of this country, detailing the Masonic lives of Ben Franklin and George Washington, was particularly interesting and the book did an excellent job of describing some of the terms I've heard used but was unclear of. Mainly of the ""Moderns"" and ""Ancients"" branches of Freemasonry.I would have given it 5 stars except it was a little unclear on the terms of Scottish and Ancient York Rite he threw around describing the origins of the Fraternity.Overall this is an excellent, well written book. It would be a great addition to any brother's Masonic library, or a book for the curious folk wanting to learn more about the great institution of Freemasonry."
2,A very disappointing book,"After reading all the great customer reviews here, I thought I'd check this book out. It was disappointing, to say the least. Sure, the author goes into the history of the secret society, starting with the construction of King Solomon's temple. But none of this is new. I've read books on the Knights Templar that present the same history in a much more interesting way.This book is very dry and uninteresting. At times it became hard to follow, because the author kept moving back and forth chronologically, sometimes repeating the same story in different chapters. And if you're looking for ""secrets"" of the Masons, forget it. I feel I know as much now about the Freemasons as I did before I started reading this book."
2,"Nothing New, Some Mistakes","This book does not contain much that hasn't already been exhausted in previous books. I read this book the day after finishing Jasper Ridley's volume on Freemasonry, and it seems like the author of this book (for the most part) paraphased Ridley. I recommend Ridley's book. Also, there are some incorrect statements- one being that the eligible age of joining DeMolay is 13. The correct age is 12. That was not well researched. A simple visit to demolay.org would have fixed that problem. As a senior DeMolay and Master Mason, I prefer reading books on Masonry by Masons. Among the great authors are S. Brent Morris, W.L. Wilmshurst, and Allen Roberts. Also recommended are the books by John J. Robinson, who became a mason shortly after writing his 3 books on Freemasonry."
3,OK,This book has a lot of information-it just seems almost every sentence is filled with a quote somebody else wrote. It is just a little hard for me to follow.
2,I hate this book,I fell asleep while reading it TWICE. I only gave it a two because i like the cover.
5,very nicely made,This little drum is very nicely made. I didn't purchase it to play and only used it as a part of my alter decorations.
5,Gorgeous movie - when's it out on DVD?!!!!!,I've loved this movie since it first came out and ever since I've been looking for a copy of my own. Has anyone got any news about a possible DVD release?
4,Any ideas on how to get the title song?,"Hey everyone!I'd really love to either download or get a copy of the title song ""Fire With Fire"" by Wild Blue. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!!Thanks!"
5,80's flick is fun to watch and goes for the heart,"I saw this movie when it first came out on video and of course loved it! More than ten years later, it is still one of my favorites. If you like romance, this movie will definitley appeal to you. The leads are believable and enjoyable to watch but I, too, wish that it had a SOUNDTRACK! If anyone knows where some of the songs are available, let me know."
5,bout time;-),"Omg! Bluray?! This was one of my favorites when I was young, been waiting a long time to see it again, sweet!"
3,My favorite movie,"I love, love, love this movie, but could only give this a 3 star rating because of the particular seller that I dealt with. There was a note in the package stating that if there was a problem contact them and they would fix it. I did and they didn't. This video is very dark and the sound quality is poor. At least I was able to see it again, but I was truly disappointed."
5,What is it about this?,"I randomly came across this on Netflix and god almighty I know it's sort of cheesy but it's hot and sexy and Craig Sheffer was adorable beyond all reason. The Lisa character is annoying and giggly but the chemistry between her and Joe is so electric,,,they had to have been fooling around in the real world...wow. I had not seen that level of speechless electricity since I saw 'Damage' or such a sexy male lead since Mickey Rourke in 9.5 Weeks. By the way, how interesting that the first dance is to Slave to Love, a great song that was also used in 9.5 Weeks as Mickey pounds Kim Basinger in a clock tower! Really, would the nuns play that song at a dance? That is just one of the many silly things in this movie but Craig Sheffer is just that sexy and the love story so sweet you just can't help it."
4,One of the best romantic movies of the 80's...hopelessly waiting for the DVD,"I love this movie!!!!!!!!! It was so romantic, sexy, exciting, sweet, man I miss the 80's and my youth! I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for the longest...just like every other fan! But in the meantime, I watch the film on Youtube! Long live the 80's and all those great love stories like Fire with Fire...Craig S. looked so fine in the movie :o)"
5,Best movie ever!,"This is my favorite movie of all time! I saw it when it was in the theater in the 80's and have always loved it. I finally found a copy on DVD that someone made from a VHS tape. I would LOVE to get a copy of the soundtrack, though. Let me know if someone makes a copy for sale!!"
5,A Great Love Story,I love this movie and have been searching all over for it ever since the first time I saw it. It is a bit corny but that was typical of 80's movies. I always loved the ending because I thought it was unique. It wasn't the typical 80's love story ending. I also thought the movie was for a more mature audience than the typical 80's movies that were released at the time.
4,A Little Bit of Everything,Fire With Fire is one of those movies that has a little bit of everything to appeal to a wide audience. It has great action as well as the romance. It is definately a movie you will like. I remembered this movie from years ago and have been looking for it since then. I am glad it is available again.
3,Not revised since 1982,"The listing suggests that this book was revised in 2000, but the copyright date printed in the book is 1982, followed by the phrase ""Second printing January 2001"". The authors suggest buying the Forest Service maps for $1 and the USGS 15' quads for $1.25 (the former are now $6 and the latter were discontinued from sale around 1988), and the 714 area code listed for Bishop and Mammoth Lakes has been pulled back a few hundred miles, to something like a part of Orange County. No mention of bear canisters here, just the counterbalance method, but then the canisters probably had not even been conceived back then. But the vast majority of the book is devoted to describing the route itself, so presumably that is still pretty much up to date, unless any portion(s) of the trail were re-routed."
5,Aprende mas espanol,"Consider why you want to learn Spanish. If you are looking for a way to communicate in your work and daily life with Spanish speaking people, then you would be making a mistake to not investigate this series. If you are pursuing purely academic interests, then you might want to explore other options."
4,excellent,"Nice 70s slick. This album has that pollished CTI sound on disco pills. The music is dancable but complex enough to work as updated dance jazz funk.Greatr back up vocals here and some great flute by reed demon Jeremy Steig.Before smooth jazz become homoginezed milk, some of it was pretty cool. This album is one of those specimens."
5,Mathnet (from Square One Television),I love this show and this its quite entertaining having George and Pat Tuesday investgating and figuring out on Math. I watch this show on Square One TV on PBS and now on Noggin. I hope they re-released those episodes on video and DVD.
5,A wonderful book! A real Winner,"If you have any questions on Border Collies,this is the book to have!I was very impressed.It is filled with all kinds of doggie tips & fun facts.This covers all aspects of this wonderful dog.It includes chapters on why you might want a Border Collie,preparing to bring you dog home,grooming,training, and for those of you who already have a Border Collie, curbing the herding instinct & correcting problems such as barking or biting. A wonderful book to have, I loved it."
4,Good Info,"Decent book on border collies. There's a few instances when I question their information based upon other books I've read, but basically a decent primer."
4,"LOOK MA, NO POWER CORD!","IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE PACKAGE AND IT'S POWERED BY USB!! THAT'S MY FAVORITE FEATURE. IT COMES WITH AUTO BACKUP SOFTWARE BUT I DON'T USE THAT. I DUNNO WHY EVERYTIME I SHUT DOWN MY COMPUTER WITH THIS DEVICE PLUGGED IN, IT SEEMS TO PREVENT IT FROM DOING SO. THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A 4 NOT 5."
1,Beware: does not work on PowerBooks,"I run Mac 10.4, and according to the specs, this drive should have worked. The USBs in my computer are not enough to power the machine, so I ended up with a beautiful, shiny brick. If one needs a Y-Adaptor connecting to two ports for the product to work in a PowerBook, then the product (or at the very least, the description) should include such information.I feel ripped off."
4,If it wasn't of its price it would be perfect,"This hard disk is very fast, is very small in physical size so you can put it in any bag and carry it wherever you want, I really feel very pleased with my buying. the only cons is its price, but anyway I needed it."
3,Nice but easy to be damaged,"I tried many types of external hard drivers, and most of those were different brand names with non-original mass box. They are all sharing a major problem which is the safety of removing device from computer that causes sometime losing data. WD has the same issue which makes the whole component is made together ""Hard drive and mass box"" therefore had to be completely secured from losing data."
4,Works great so far,"I bought this drive about a month ago to use with Time Machine. So far, it has worked perfectly. It looks great and is very compact, meaning it fits on my desk great. I am using it with a Dec. 2007 MacBook, and it works perfectly fine - no power problems like those mentioned with some other laptops. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I just haven't had it very long and don't know enough about hard drives to say much more than I already have. Conclusion: I would definitely buy it again. Based on the looking-around I did before buying, this still strikes me as one of the best options out there for portable drives with decent capacity."
5,Excellent product,"I Bought this product to use it with my Mac Ibook G4 and works flawlessly. I also ordered the aditional Y cable that I read in the reviews that it may need, and it don't. It works very well. very happy with my purchase"
5,Very Happy With Drive,"This is a great drive and has speed as good as other USB 2.0 drives I have tested.Pros:small, light, easy to install, sturdy USB port cover, nice short USB cableCons:It will never be without a fingerprint unless I wear gloves while hooking it up, surface scratches easilyI would have no problem recomending this drive to anyone that is not obsessive about clean accessories."
3,good but inconsistent,"I purchased this product to use with a macbook pro 15"".The drive works fine when the machine is able to mount it. Sometimes have to try many times before that happens.. and then sometimes when the drive is mounted it unmounts for no reason.. I don't have the cable that is mentionned and gives power.. Just tested as delivered in the box...I do not recommend it for critical data.. you don't know if it will work.."
2,I highly DO NOT recommend this drive for portable use,"If you planning on keeping this drive in one spot such as on your desk and not using it for on the go, then this drive may work out.This drive is no passport portable device, it needs to be stable to prevent damage to its internal disk and moving parts-I bought this drive planning to use it for school and even with careful packing in my computer case the drive still got messed up. So instead I bought a 16gb flash drive that does not have the internal moving parts like this drive has and it ended up working perfect.If you end up buying this drive make sure to register it with ED because I am 100% positive if you use it as a portable drive you will need it replaced by the WD warrenty-"
4,Easy to use,"I had no problems using this product. I worked immediately upon plugging it into my computer without having to download any of the software.***I say this with a HUGE sigh of relief after the frustration of dealing with the Western Digital WDG1C5000N My Book Premium Edition 500 GB USB 2.0/Firewire External Hard Drive by Western Digital, which I returned within 2 days of receiving. It didn't even back up a 1/4 of my data before it started crashing randomly (disconnecting from the computer on its own). Don't buy a My Book!***I have to say that I had doubts that the Western Digital Passport (250 GB) would work since I had so many problems with the My Book. Thankfully I had none of the problems that I had with the My Book. It won't work thru my UBS hub but other than that (very small) issue I'm happy. At least so far."
4,"portable as it gets, but...","This is a very nice product if you are looking for the least amount of space in an external hard drive. Why I am not giving it five stars its comming next, but if you are using it for a back up or to transfer files it works great.Now the cons on this item...1. The drive gets its power from the usb cable. I do not know if its common at all but my laptop limits usb bus power to 500mAmp per slot. This hard drive does not work with a normal usb cable if your lap does that.2. If you will use it for playback (small video files, mp3 and such) expect gaps every once in a while.Summary, super small and cool looking with few details depending on your pc and intended use"
4,"Great convenience, decent performance","This is pretty much just what I was looking for - a large, portable, no AC req'd HD. It's the best deal I could find on the market. Only slight downside is performance is not as strong as it would be w/ a HD w/ more power.I use it w/ Mac OS X Leopard as a Time Machine backup disk, and aside from taking 36 hours to initialize for first run (not uncommon according to Apple website) it's been terrific ever since - I just plug it in every few days, and os x does my backup behind the scenes."
2,Sexy-looking drive but Needs Auxilliary Power!,"I don't really care for WD drives in general, due to their poor reliability. But YES I bought this drive because of its looks, size, and capacity (exactly right to keep a portable backup of my laptop). However, over the years it has failed me more than once, and I only resisted throwing it out because of the looks(!) It turns out it has power-draw ""issues"", as some reviewers have noted. You can read more about that here: [...] .. In a nutshell, I am only using this drive in conjunction with my spiffy CablesToGo Powered USB Hub (which I also bought on Amazon some years back). But now this drive is a paperweight instead of a sleek-looking road-warrior device! So if you're buying one of these Passport drives ... head over and pickup a powered USB hub while you're at it!"
3,Once again -- you have been warned...,"As many others have said -- it doesn't work with all USB drives. My wife and I are both on Powerbook G4s, here's is a year older than mine and it works fine on hers. On mine, I guess there isn't enough power out of the ports. Otherwise, a very cool little drive. Not the fastest, but the size is unbelievable."
1,Horrible Product and Customer Serivce. My 500G Passport Broke down after 5 days.,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from Western Digital. Unreliable and they have the horrible customer service. I bought a hard drive (500G) from them that broke down after 5 days. They told me that it wasn't their fault and refused to help. HORRIBLE experience. I lost 500 gigs of data.
1,Drive Failures Within a Week,"Western Digital has always had a tremendous reputation for quality drives. I used a TEAC casing with Seagate drive for years as a portable drive without any issues.Within a week of getting this model, the drive wouldn't spin up. The drive had been carried in a protective case and used on solid surfaces when in use--a desk, in most cases. One reviewer, Brandi, reviewed that the drive has problems when being moved--I'm not sure if the movement caused the issue or not, but if that's the case, then the drive is a failure for a ""portable hard drive"".Unfortunately, replacement or not, I'm now leery of the device and see backups going from weekly to daily. :( What a hassle."
5,Fantastic upgrade for any Intel-based Mac notebook,"I purchased this drive to install in my MacBook Pro. I used a program called ""SuperDuper"" to image my internal drive to the WD Passport, which made a bootable copy of everything on my computer. I then took out the WD drive from the plastic case and installed it in my laptop. After replacing the old drive into the WD USB case, I had a great backup drive (for TimeMachine or whatever) for my system. I highly recommend this drive. Low cost, quiet operation, and < so far > no issues at all. Buy it now!"
5,Amazing!!!,This is the best one I bought. No need for power supply and so compact you can carry it in you shirt pocket. Perfect for mass storage.
3,Good drive but does not work on some computers,"This might be a good drive, but it is not usable on some computers. To power up, drive requires ~ 650 mA, which is more than USB on my HP laptop can provide.USB 2.0 Power Booster cable can be used to solve that problem. It combines power from 2 USB ports, but it is currently out of stock on Western Digital store. I am not aware of any alternative solution and I could not find similar cable on the Net.Before purchase, I would recommend:1. Check USB settings on computer2. Check availability of USB 2.0 Power Boost cable"
4,No Power Booster Cable,This is a very good drive but be aware that it does not work with all USB ports - a lot of them will not supply enough power to run the drive so you will need the power booster cable WDCA029RNN which connects to 2 USB ports to get enough power to the drive. The pity is that WD do not include this as standard since quite a number people buying this item will actually need it to run the drive. Would have got 5 stars were it not for this.Western Digital WDXMS2500TN Passport Portable 250GB Hard Drive ( Black )
4,"Great purchase, silent and very portable","This external drive was affordable and has proven reliable. It has fallen a couple times to the floor without losing my data, which is more than I could ask for. It is also estetically pleasing, though the plastic has proven to be very scratch-prone.It would have deserved 5 stars, except that is is not made of recyclable materials and the manufacturer has provided no option for sending the unit in for recycling."
5,A lot of Space for the money!,I purchased this drive so I could store files on it and not clog up my desktop hard drive. Lots of room on this bad boy and the price was less than 50 cents per gigabyte.
1,did not work with iMac,The 250GB USB portable hard drive was not reliably recognized by my iMac. I didn't have the desire to trouble shoot something like this right out of the box because dependability is something that I would expect in a hard drive. There are too many competitors and too many Macs out there to tolerate this so I sent it back. I may try a Lacie or Maxtor....
4,Very nice,This is a very sleek and dense HDD. Its awesome. Have had it for over a month and no issues so far. Looks professional.
4,Very good,"I've had before a normal external HD, bigger and with power supply, and this one is too much better. Smaller and as faster than the old one. I did not notice speed difference. I recommend."
1,"Dead in 2 months, ""out-of-warranty"" based on manuf date","Disappointed. It failed after 2 uses, within 2 months of purchase. WD bases the warranty on date of manufacture, and says it's out of warranty. Unfortunately, I don't have the receipt to contradict or override their information.Very upset. $$$ down the drain. 'Nuf said."
1,2nd WD passport drive fails,"I've purchased 2 WD Passport drives and both failed to work after about a year of light use (once or twice per month). They spin for 2 seconds then stop and then again and again the same thing. They also get very hot and sometimes have trouble stop spinning so they can be ejected. The product is cheap, but I'd rather spend more money for something that won't quit on me. Not durable at all. I carry them around sometimes and am very careful - this might have hurt their performance, but doesn't portable mean that you can carry them between work and home? Isn't this the point? DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great for high wind areas,The other sprinklers made the water like aerosol and did not work as well in low pressure times. These work great for us. We have one on every hose.
3,Got the job done for a low price,"I used this sprinkler to water the small back yard of a townhouse.One problem was that the water did not evenly cover the entire area, there would be dry spots after a while of the water running. I solved this by turning down the water pressure after several minutes so that the water covered a different smaller area. This was easy and allowed me to water the whole area.The sprinkler does not take up much space and is easy to attach to the hose."
4,Being careful,"I had looked at Ipods for a long time and decided to finally get one. I bought one and when I opened it, I noticed it was only set for firewire. Therefore, I immediately had to go out and spend money on a firewire card to use it. If they would have told me this before hand, I could have bought it before. Otherwise the product is a very nice MP3 player and if you need an MP3 player and Palm Pilot, I would suggest getting this."
4,I love my ipod!,"What a great device. It stores everything I could want and then some. Its battery life is a little disappointing after several months, which is why I'm giving it four stars. The navigation is smooth and very effective. Long plane flights and car trips seem far shorter with this gadget in my hand.Highly recommended!"
2,You pay for a brand name,"Overly expensiveProhibitive file transfer (one computer only)Bad battery lifeBattery replacement costs at least $50 moreUSB/Firewire cable not includedNo playlist generation on the flyLimited file type supportSmall screenOversensitive/difficult to use touch interfaceBut if you want to spend hundreds for a brand name, be my guest...In the meantime I will go against the status quo happily with my Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen in hand."
2,Windows USB users alert,"You need an optional cable to connect to USB. Even though Apple says it is compatible with Firewire and USB, they do not mention that to be compatible you need to buy another cable.Why don't they learn; reminds me of not including unusual batteries in toys and the annoyance of just looking but not playing."
2,bad sound quality,"I've had this product for 10 days now, and i'm very disapointed with it. I loved it when i opened the box, charged the batteries, turned on and found out about the extra features it had (contacts, notes etc). The dispointment was when I found out i had to pay extra $40 for firewire card. After downloading some CDs into the iPod there was more disapointment.I'm just surprised that not too many people perceive the bad sound quality of iPod. The Bass is very bad even in good headpphones. Even my girlfriend that is not a sound freak perceives the difference from my other mp3 players.Of course the battery life is discouraging too, but this is a known issue mentioned by many users.I'm returning my iPod today and thinking of iRiver instead. The more songs iPod can hold and play them in bad quality the more reason to get rid of it."
1,if the only the battery worked,"I have purchased three ipods for myself, and over 10 ipods for friends in the last year. All of my ipods and about 3/4's of the ones I gave to friends have had battery problems. Within six months of use, the battery only holds a charge for about 1 hour, sometimes less. Since we all use the ipods independently, you can rule out user error. Also, the battery needs to be constantly recharged. This makes a wonderful piece of equipment almost useless, and a constant source of frustration. Also, you get no help from Apple when you try to contact them. Unfortunately, the ipod is not built to easily replace the battery. All in all, the ipod is a wonderful innovation with a fatal flaw."
5,Like music? Get an iPod,"I've used several (about a dozen) different mp3 players. Sony, Samsung, JVC, others. None of them match up to the iPod in my opinion. Easy to use, durable, great sound quality (if you're smart enough to use Apple Lossless format), and lots of great accessories. Sure, you could go buy something cheaper...just know that you'll be getting what you pay for. I've heard people talk about problems with battery life and such, but mine has been working wonderfully since I got it about a year ago. Rarely have I not gotten at least 7 1/2 hours of play time from mine. I wouldn't trade my iPod for any other mp3 player, but I'm sure planning on trading my PC for a Mac after the outstanding experiences I've had with Apple products. One suggestion though, for those that do want to get an iPod...get it straight from Apple, it'll save you some money over what you'll pay here on Amazon."
2,Battery Life is key and the ipod had failed on its battery,"If it wasn't for the inaccurate battery indicator and rediculously small amount of charge it will hold and retain, I'd give the iPod 5 stars. While you may be able to get 6+ hrs of ""continuous"" playback on one full charge, that will hardly be the case in real life. If I mix music listening with file transfer on my iPod, battery life is the sorriest I've seen out of any portable device I've used. On a full charge with an almost brand new ipod, and yes, it was properly discharged during the previous cycle, it would only last about half an hour for file transfers. Apparently, the continous harddisk spin contributed greatly. I purchased my ipod as not only a walkman, but a portable storage device as well. And that's what's worth the extra bucks to make the iPod stand out from the rest of competition. And if the battery won't keep up with the device, I can only give a generous 2 stars."
1,simply weird,"it said dopwnload up to 40000 songs, but i can only download 4000....isnt that weird??im weird"
1,"Limited Battery life, no features Overpriced","With the plethora of less expensive and more feature rich Mp3 players hitting the market daily, why would you want to pay $400 for an ipod, other than to satisfy some lemming instinct?The ipod is made of plastic and looks like a fisher price toy and is as simple as that.It plays and store music, but no fm no recording capabilities and hardly any battery life at allWould give this a zero if possible-$400 is a lot of money to play music in mac format."
1,Overpriced closed system,"This piece of garbage is the most overpriced overhyped contraption on the market. I returned my today and got a Samsung Napster player. For starters the Ipud only plays some wacky proprietary Apple format.My new Napster player has an FM tuner, voice recording and works great in the car and with the Napster service which has a greater catolgue and user interface.I bought into the Apple hype. But returned it after I learned that there was a player that works with the Napster service-the Samsung Napster player."
1,About to be blown out of the water.,"you can now order the Creative jukebox zen touch, which has a similar touchpad touchsensitive interface as the IPOD and 20GB harddrive, USB 2, blah blah ,blahTHere is something that makes it vastly better than every SINGLE mp3 player out therea 24-hour battery, that's right it can play for an entire day.I think that that might just blow IPOD's PITIFUL 8-hour battery out of the waterit has three times teh battery life for $279a 20GB IPOD is $399, over a hundred dollars more for the same features and 2/3 less batteryoh yah it only weigh 7.2 ounces, thats only 2 more than the IPOD and a whole 2 ounces less than the original ZENYep IPOD IS DEAD TO ME"
1,Is it just me??,"I love iPods..I've had the 15gb for a while and recently purchased the 20gb from Amazon. But the one they sent me doesn't even turn on, charge, or anything. Am I the only one who got a totally not working iPod from Amazon?? Now I have to send it into the AppleCare Depot to get it fixed and sent back. This will take at least 2 weeks! At least I have my 15 to tide me over.. :("
2,At your own risk!!,"I'm only giving the ipod two stars, and i'm being generous. why?I ordered my Ipod, and within two weeks it had stopped working. I happily sent it back and was, weeks later, given a replacement. This time it didn't work right out of the box! After hours on hold and begging for a refund, I was told that I couldn't have my money back because I didn't send it back in the first ten days!(if only I could have predicted the breakdown of my expensive impulse buy!)so, I was sent a third Ipod. Get this...It was engraved to someone else, and even included the other persons email address! It wasn't even a new pod, but a referbished one. I emailed the young lady who's pod it was, and she answered that the whole thing was ""f'd up"".I decided to keep it, because at least it worked this time, but be careful before you leap. Apple didn't help me at all, and i'm stuck wishing i'd stuck with cds and mixtapes. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK"
1,This is NOT the new iPod,It seems amazon wants to clear out some inventory before adding the new one.THIS IS NOT THE IPOD THAT WAS RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO(this may seem obvious...but I know of a few people that have been burned already)
5,Defining slick.,"This is one of the most well executed and designed pieces of equipment I've ever seen. The auto-update feature makes it beyond user friendly. You plug the thing in, and it does all the rest for you. The wheel allows you to scroll through hundreds of songs quickly and neatly. The remote means that the ipod can sit in your backpack and you still control playback. The sound quality is at least as good as the best portable cd player I've ever owned and generally much better. Buy this. You want it. You can even download audiobooks. Not only a little cool.The only complaint I have is actually about ITunes. After downloading songs from cd, I have to restart my computer before I can listen to them - on the computer that is; they still download to ipod just fine. Don't know why, but that's a minor inconvenience amidst a thus unmarred experience."
3,"Pricey, buggy.","I purchased the 20 GB iPod about a month ago... Even though the price is over $100 higher for comparable models, I heard how great the iPod was quality-wise. I'm just not seeing it.Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the device is just plain buggy. It shows that the music is paused when it is playing, and vice versa. The electro-static controls don't always ""register"" that you touched them. While the capacity is great, the fact that its a hard drive makes it slow. Skipping to a song can sometimes take 4 or 5 seconds, leaving you wondering if you really hit ""next"" to go to the next song. Also, sometimes it just skips over the song as though it can't read it. I returned my first one because I thought it was defective, but the replacement does the same. I guess its just how the iPod works.Also, the optional USB cable is proprietary (and therefore not optional at all if you intend to use USB). So, most windows users add another $20 to the price."
1,"HUGE, IMORTANT, MUST KNOW information on ipod",FYI - the lifespan of the ipod's rechargeable battery is only covered by warranty for one year. If you use it a lot - which is probably the case with most users - be prepared to shell out $100+ to get it replaced in less than 2 years.
5,THis thing is amazing!!!,"I have heard about Ipod issues, but so far mine is amazing. Toys come and go, but this is a toy that actually has a major impact on your life if you are a music lover. A piece of art."
2,iPod Review,"At first when I received my iPod, I was very excited, and had quite high expectations to the product, but these expectations didn't seem to last for long. IPod is said to have approximately 8 hours of continuous play. I though those 8 hours could just cover it - so I bought it.Here the thing: my iPod was able to play 3-4 hours of music, depending on how often I changed songs, used the backlight etc.Pros:- Great Design: nice touch wheel and easy to operate- Good Playback: awesome sound and good earphones- Nice Features: browse songs, playlists etc.Cons:- Battery Life: the battery life totally ruins this product!- Scratches Easily: especially the metal back of the iPod scratches very easily.- Technical Errors: during my short relationship with the iPod, I experienced several errors, mostly when charging from the docking station.The bottom line: don't buy this product!"
2,QUICKLY BECOMING OBSOLETE,"The Ipod was once a King of all digital music players but it is very close to becoming obsolete. WHY? #1 Battery life, #2 lack of recording ability, #3 Proprietary software RESTRICTIONS. MP3's really don't sound anywhere near as good as CD's. Sure you can play WAV files on an Ipod but it uses up battery so fast (3 HOURS!) that it isn't feasible, especially since you have to pay Apple $100 to replace your batteries every year or two. The future of music will be higher quality with bigger files, but since higher bandwidths require more battery power, Ipod will not have the muscle to compete with other players. Look for a player with an internal Lithium Polymer battery. Also, try to get a Jukebox that is plug-and-play and doesn't need drivers or software."
1,Garbage,"I got mine less than a month ago in the US (I live in Brazil)a few days ago I was walking back home when it suddenly froze, no more sound just the screen at that exact moment, nothing much you can do about it since not even frenetic button pressing or pluging it on the computer solved, well now I have to take it 150 km from my place to an Apple shop and if reposition is necessary I'll have to wait about one more month. So I couldn't more pleased with my sweet iPod ,thanx apple"
2,Waste,"Who really needs 5,000 songs if all you can get is 8 hours of play time...Who will buy 5,000 songs... honestly the mini is the better choice. It holds 1,000 songs which should be good enough for anyone and costs a lot less. Also you can change the songs too."
5,Incredible,"I recently bought the 20GB iPod. It is truly an amazing product. It is extremely easy to use and with iTunes, which is free(www.apple.com), you can load all of your songs on to your iPod effortlessly. The only draw backs are that if you don't already have a firewire card, it is strongly recommended. The other drawback is that iTunes does not work with Windows versions 98SE and earlier. Apart from these minor drawbacks, the iPod is great and I highly recommend it for anyone who thoroughly enjoys music."
2,I really wanted it to work!,"I bought the 10GB ipod when it was being discontinued at target for $150, which i thought was a great deal. It would've been a great deal if the ipod hadn' stopped working after about 2 weeks. I dont know if i just got a lemon or what because everyone seems to think ipods are the best. AT first it did work great. After about the 3rd time transfering music onto it i had some problems, it would just stop mid transfer and freeze up for a while and then i could get it to work again. Then it started making my computer crash everytime i plugged it in. Finally it just wouldnt even recognize it as being plugged into the comp. i dont know what was wrong with it or if it could've been fixed. all i know is that i really like it when it worked but it was just too much of a headache for me to try to fiddle with. anyways i took it back and am now researching other players."
4,Love my Ipod,Ok not a 5 but nothing is perfect. Not real thrilled with the musicmatch setup but it worked fine. I just didn't want to keep paying money for the updated version to buy my songs. So instead I downloaded I tunes and it worked great. I can't believe how easy it is to transfer my songs from my cd's I love it. It is small and easy to carry in your pocket. The learning curve for use is minimal which is what makes the Ipod so great. Nice Job Apple!
2,Buyer Beware,"The I Pod is by far the best of all MP 3 players. However, it has its problems mainly with freezing. My kept freezing and none of Apple suggestions seem to work. So if you want a player that doesn't freeze and just as easy to use go with the new mini disc player. You'll be less frustated and happier you did."
2,Looks great,"i know its the best selling mp3player in the world, it looks very sleek, but if you have windows, your on your own. called apple store to buy one and i had 2 questions about it, they basically told me go to go away once i mentioned windows. they were rude to me, didnt fix my problem, and they lost my buisness. so if your thinking about buying one for windows buy a creative or a samsung"
1,Overpriced hyped toy,"Doesn't support WMA, overpriced. Better choices-Gateway's 20GBplayer for $100 less. The Samsung Napster player for the same price but with recording capabilities and fm tuner and transmitter for car playing."
5,Nearly perfect.,"It's simply amazing, its storage capacity is wonderfull and it really sounds perfect. The only problem is that it doesn't play fine some albums like live concerts and other kind of continous-playing albums. The problem is that when a song finishes, ther is an empty period of time before the other song starts. I already know that it is an MP3 problem and that period of time is not long; but it is still a bug."
3,Little things mean a lot,"I love my iPod and am glad I shelled out the almost $400 for it. I love the ability to use it as a hard drive. I love the transfer speeds and the fact that I have music for any mood in my pocket. Even the headphones are respectable. It would have gotten at least 4 stars if it weren't for one incredibly annoying thing that PC users should be aware of (which unfortunately neither the Amazon description or even Apple's iPod website make clear):Although the device is FireWire and USB 2.0 compatible, a USB 2.0 adapter is not included with the iPod!! So you receive your great new toy and quickly learn that you can't play with it until you purchase another cable. ARGHH!!!That's just rude."
3,Last Year's Model Costs the Same as This Year's Model?,"Amazon price: Apple 20 GB iPod M9244LL/A $299.99 (Last Year)Apple.com price: Pod w/Click Wheel (20GB) M9282LL/A $299.99 (This Year)Come on, Amazon, get the new gear in stock or give a decent discount"
3,A Misleading Title,"This text is most definitely not an introduction. It is comprehensive and certainly useful, but if you're a beginner like me looking to grasp the fundamentals of cognitive science, there are easier paths. The text seems to assume that the reader already understands certain concepts and employs technical terminology from the start without much explanation. The rather dense, obtuse writing style does not help. If you're a layman, a beginner without any background in cognitive science, you'll save yourself much confusion and frustration by not buying this book. I might recommend this book to someone already familiar with cognitive science needing a refresher, as the text is thorough and comprehensive."
1,A piece of crap,"This book reads like the author dictated it from his desk half-drunk,with a bunch of magazine articles about Sharon Stone as a reference. Poorly written; as a book,its a mess. Even public figures should not be subjected to this type of abuse. Its laughable in the way names are dropped that have nothing to do with the subject and then placed in an index as if this were a serious book. The author's attempt at jokes areembarassing. Unbelievable."
1,Save your money. This book is garbage,"I feel like trashing this book, but how do you trash trash? How do you poop on poop? I am happy with everything else I got from amazon.com, but this book is... . Make a note of the author's name. I will never waste my money on anything he writes ever again. I won't buy his books even if he uses a pseudonym. How did a great publisher like Birch Lane ever pass on this, anyway?"
5,Hop skip and jump,"This upbeat fusion of Ehtiopia world beat and Hip-hop leaves you breathless from the outset and never lets go. The opening track Bole to Harlem sets a wonderful danceable tone. One of the biggest complaints about hip hop are the repetitive and redundant themes. Its hard to not enjoy the blended rhythms of hip hop combined with bole. THis is a cd you will play and before you know it, its all you want to listen to."
4,Stomp to Bole to Harlem - Gring on volume #2,"Since Mother Nature does not have a download, Dave's globe trotting rhythms can get the message across for her that we are all connected.This CR kicks of strong with track one that will refuse to leave your brain, luckily the other tracks take you on a ride around Bole and Harlem occasionally hinting back to track one.Ashagre"
5,A Great Biography of a Great Author,"This is a well-researched detailed biography of the life of Anne McCaffrey, starting with her childhood and following the development of her writing career to the present. It does a good job of presenting the major events in McCaffrey's life and situating what novels she was working on at various times amongst those events. Included are quite a number of interesting photographs, a chronology, a partial list of McCaffrey's works, and sources for further reading including web sites. I really enjoyed reading this biography, and while I was already pretty well informed about McCaffrey's life I did learn new things from this book.It should be noted that this book is part of series which is aimed at teens, and this is evident as the book stops to explain terms such as magna cum laude. But I think that McCaffrey fans of all ages will find it a very good read, just as they enjoy her own books that were aimed at a younger audience."
2,Royal Copenhagen Musk Cologne,"I have been a user of this product since the 1980s. I first purchased a bottle of the cologne inBuffalo Newyork from a mens clothing store. I loved the scent and received many compliments from the ladies. At that time , the product was manufactured in Denmark. The last orders that I received were not marked ""Denmark"", so I assumed they were manufactured in the USA.Unfortunately, the product has changed radically in that it lacks that special scent it had previously. Also , the scent is not long lasting. Apparently, when it was manufactured in Denmark, something special was added.Sorry I could not be more favorable.Carl"
2,leaking bottles,"My wife ordered this for me, wrapped them for a gift and put it under the tree, when I opened them they were half full very dissapointing"
1,Not the real thing,"This was a knock-off. I have used the ""real"" musk from Denmark for over 30 years, but this product was colored water."
5,Review of Royal Copenhagen Musk Cologne,I love the fragrence of the RC Musk and so does my wife. Price was reasonable through Amazon and shipped quickly. I will reorder when what I purchased is consumed.
2,Not Sassy's best,"We usually love Sassy, but my 6-month old isn't at all interested in this toy. The activities are too close together for her to manipulate and there isn't a good surface to chew on. It's also quite heavy, making it hard for her to hold and play with on her own."
2,D O N T B U Y !!!,This toy is fragile! This toy is uninteresting! This toy's paint comes off easily!
3,Rather Boring,"This toy is rather boring. Instead of my 7 month old playing with it, she likes to hear it shake while she tries to eat it.Mother Love"
4,Fun and portable,"My 6 month old loves this toy! She's fascinated by the signature sassy color scheme and loves the variety of sounds this thing makes. The price is excellent for the ""quiet"" play time it provides. Good stocking stuffer idea for the new baby, too."
4,Easy to take along,"Well, I bought this for my son, and he likes it. Test one complete. I thought it would be a little bigger than what it was, so some of the things are a little harder for him to get to. Still, it has given him lots of drag-around play time since he got it."
2,"Nice Look, Nice Humidity, Yet Problems","We purchased this humidifier at WalMart when they were clearanced last year and got them out of the attic for this winter. First of all I don't understand how it can be called a ""15 gallon"" humidifier when it really only holds 4 gallons - can anyone explain this? Also, we have also had problems with knowing when to refill it until the humidifier starts making a funny noise (and this surely isn't good on the machine to constantly let it run out of water). Also, we have had a funny substance running out of the machine almost from the beginning of use, and today while wiping up the ""junk"" I noticed that it is green now. ???? Anyway - the reason I rated it a '2' is because it is nice looking and does run 'fairly' quietly when it is full of water. Overall, our family has been very disappointed in this humidifier."
3,melancholy,"This is a frustrating yet beautifully sad book. It is moving. Architecture doesn't need philosophy, so it is argued by architects. Less do they need critics. Architecture criticism suffers from its own omnipotence. Noone is listening, except other critics. Architecture is frozen music, not frozen words, however much critics think otherwise, so it is written. Connah lives this frustrated doomed world."
4,incommensurable worlds,"We had to read this book for a class on architecture theory. What has this book of poems got to do with architecture? It hits out at the pretensions of mediocre architecture theorists Better to be a man of the forest than a theoretical bore who doesn't know his hind from his Heidegger. This book is great elitism, in the most positive sense of the word. If you can't stand with the very best then bow down before those who know what they are talking about, and pay attention. Or shed your pretensions and work with that which is close at hand, the techtonics of architecture. Recommended reading for all students."
1,Not worth it,"I had this thermostat in my home for 3 years. It mysteriously failed for 3 days last year (no AC) and then suddenly worked right before the AC repair man could arrive. It worked another year and experienced same issue but never regained consciousness. It would not keep the numerically selected setting. I could actually stand there and watch it climb or drop over 10 degrees in a matter of seconds, which in turn would immediately shut off either my heat or AC, whichever. Backup batteries were not related to this issue. Owners manual had no customer service hot line number for me to call (another nice touch, very professional). It now adorns the local landfill. Try a Rite Temp touch-pad at half the price."
3,A Novel of the Superficial and Ineffectual,"In short, this is mind candy, no less entertaining than a good fannish Cthulhu Mythos story, but not what I would have expected from people who claim to be HPL/REH fans. The basic idea is a good one: bring the ""Three Musketeers of WEIRD TALES"" (Howard, Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith) together against creatures of the Mythos. Unfortunately, it's full of missteps (for one, the authors claim Howard created ""Red Sonja"", actually a 1970s comic-book invention based on a similarly named character from one of REH's historical stories). If you don't know much about REH/HPL, this won't bother you, but then why would you buy this book? Plotwise, it shambles along, like the menaces of the story, fantastic and unspeakable but ultimately disappointing."
2,Abbot and Costello Meet Cthulhu,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. If you are going to write a send up of the two kings of weird fiction, do it right! This book read like a version of ""Laurel and Hardy Go Cross Country."" As I read, I kept thinking of Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, a sort of Weird Tales Odd Couple episode. Better luck next time, guys!"
2,"Covered in goo, without ever gelling.","I picked up this book in keen anticipation. I'm a huge HLP and Smith fan (somewhat less of an REH fan, but no bother...) and thought, ""What a great idea!"" Well, it's still a great idea, but this particular book just didn't do it justice. For those interested in Yog-Sothothery (HPL himself never liked the term ""Cthulhu Mythos"")there are a number of matters which can be nitpicked. However, the book's most serious flaws are its depictions of the characters. Both are written as buffoons, who could never possibly have been friends, let alone world-savers. To the authors: try this again! The idea is great, but please show the humanity of your heroes as vividly as you have their peculiarities."
2,Mediocre star with flashes of whimsy,"I purchased Shadows Bend during a period when I was re-discovering the joys of pulp fiction. I knew both Robert E. Howard and HP Lovecraft were eccentric; therefore, the premise of the epistlary friends teaming up to battle the cephlapod god Cthulhu sounded intriguing. Unfortunately, the story didn't meet any of my expectations. It was entertaining to see HP Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard portrayed as an ersatz Laurel and Hardy team but that odd couple theme doesn't gel. It made the story comfortably normal and, in my experience, that's the antithesis of the Cthulhu stories. They generally portray a universe supremely indifferent to the foibles of humanity; a concept which fuels the existential terror enjoyed in Lovecraft's stories. Instead, Shadows Bend was good-natured. That's normally not a bad thing in a novel but it seems misplaced in a story with supremely evil monsters like shoggoths and Cthulhu. Not bad, but definitely not great."
3,A pleasant story,"This story moves a little too quickly in the beginning, moving from one ancestor to another, until you meet the story's main characters. But once you've met the cast of characters, it's hard to want to put this book down. The story is well told, in that it captures the simple way of life indicative of that era in the hill country of Texas. At first, I thought the story and its characters were too simplistic. But before long, the charm and sincerity of the story revealed itself to me. This was really a delightful story. I plan to send copies to my East Texas family!"
3,Good for storage,"I purchased this item for the storage and that part works well. It also has a dispensing feature on it..........that part does not work. It has a 1cup, 2cup & 3cup button but when I measure the rice it does not equal the cup that came with my Zojirushi rice maker. It does have a compartment that makes it easy to use my rice cup."
5,Why Do They Hate U.S.?,"This is the American history omitted from your High School lessons. Nevertheless, Overthrow will help most American connect the dots of American geo-political policies and their consequences. Why the endless stream of migrant workers across the U.S. southern borders. Why the U.S. finds itself embroiled in military action decade after decade, and the perennial: Why Do They Hate US... this book should aid in answering this question for once and for all. Hint, and its not because we love freedom. Enjoy!"
5,what we should be taught at high school and beyond...,An eye-opener!!! Excellent written and easy to follow the complicated intrigues of history and politics.
1,Can't get past the introduction!,"I knew it would have a liberal slant, but I thought I'd read it because there is such a shortage of the liberal perspective (sarcasm) in the media today, but I couldn't get past the introduction. ""By a quirk of history, the United States rose to great power at the same time multinational corporations were emerging as a decisive force...."" Or, ""Strong tribes and nations have been attacking weak ones since the beginning of history"". ""They do so..... to get more of whatever is good to have."" Can anyone take this book seriously?Did the U.S. claim the moon and all it's resources, which would be ""good to have""?"
5,As gift,I bought this as a gift particularly requested by a friend who could not find it locally. She was delighted with it.
1,Real Food for Cats: 50 Vet-Approved Recipes to Please the Feline Gastronome,Take a close look at the sample recipes: they are full of onion. Something entirely unsafe to feed your cat. This is not possibly a vet-approved book.
1,Dangerous Book!,This book should be recalled and destroyed.Feeding onions to cats??How on earth did this book ever get past the editing stage?Unbelievable!
1,Thank you to everyone about the warning on this book!,"I was all set to purchase this book in a grocery store after reviewing the contents and wanting to provide a healthy alternative for my cats. I had NO idea that onions are not safe for cats, even though I've had one for almost my entire life. If nothing else, you saved two cats! Thanks! And Amazon, get this off your shelves! Here's a great tip for everyone: NEVER buy anything until you read the reviews on Amazon first! This isn't the first time a review has saved me from making a bad buying decision!"
1,Please do not buy this book,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, these recipes as originally formulated contain onions, which are toxic to cats.If you are thinking, So what? I can leave to onions out! The new edition doesn't have onions in the recipes, so it must be fine!PLEASE reconsider. This book was obviously written by someone who did not know the first thing about feline nutrition. It just as obviously never underwent any kind of editing by anyone who knew anything about feline nutrition. This is not a small problem: Nutritional deficiencies can cause VERY serious and irreversible health problems in cats. (Would you trust a nutritionist who recommended giving your kids arsenic?) Please find another book, or better yet, talk to your veterinarian."
1,"Onions, garlic, tomatoes are toxic to cats. Don't buy this book","Part of my efforts to buy free-range, organic meat for my cats involved a brief consultation with this book. I was heartened by the book`s artful cover and the assurance thereon that all recipes were `vet-approved`.Now I`m a bit perplexed at how a veterinarian could have approved the recipes in this book. Enter a web search of the words cats and onions. Use any search engine. It seems to have been common, well-established knowledge that onions are very toxic for cats. So are garlic, tomatoes, and many of the other ingredients espoused in this quirky book.The drawings are adorable, but please do not follow the VET-APPROVED recipes."
3,Caveat Emptor,"This book is based on a great premise, and one that became very pertinent not too long ago due to the petfood scares. The idea is that people can make their own cat food instead of buying it prepackaged and canned, or even slightly alter some ""people"" recipes to make them good for your cat. Many reviewers pointed out that the original version of this book contained recipes with onions in them, and that onions and garlic are toxic to cats and cause anemia and possibly death. There is a second edition out (a revised edition) which has removed the onions from the non-people recipes, but still contains garlic.The point remains that this book (even in its first edition) was touted as ""Vet Approved"" and yet clearly could not have been recommended by any vet worth their salt. It's debateable whether or not the corrected recipes are harmful to cats, or even particularly healthful. It is up to the individual reader to decide what is best for their own pets."
4,Real Food for Cats,i liked this book because my cat enjoys the food in it. She ate all recipes tried. She is healthy and energetic.
4,derailleur alignment guage,"A good product, delivered in a timely fashion. Already showed me that my new bike's derailleur was off 1 inch from side to side. Maybe a little overpriced for what it is, but most specialty tools are."
5,Very useful book,I am equity trader and I find this book very useful in terms of market risk management
1,Press-to-order DVD's not ready for prime-time,"First DVD-R was flawed; returned to Amazon and received another copy. Replacement also froze up about half-way through. Both copies couldn't play on several devices. Avoid these retail-hybrids at present. (Home-pressed dvd-r's, are one thing, selling these things to other people as if they were subjected to the same quality control protocols as standard retail dvd's another.) After being bitten twice, I'm certainly finished buying these chimeras.I still want a workable, playable copy of one of the best political films to ever come out of Hollywood. Film: magnificent; DVD product: unplayable."
3,They finally got it right!,"I purchased this movie and I found that it would not play on two of my players. It's difficult to believe that MGM would put out such poor quality. In any case, I also figured it would be pointless to request a replacement, and Amazon did provide a refund. I am very disappointed as I had been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for some time. I guess I'll have to wait a while longer (note---this is a DVD-R).Update (7-18-10)--I purchased this disc again and the same problems occurred. So there is at present no hope for a watchable region 1 DVD of this movie. If you own a multi-region DVD player, there is an excellent region 2 release from Spain (it is an official studio release). I do recommend this region 2 DVD.(Update 12-26-10)--I saw reference to a revised release date on another website and contacted Amazon--who assured me that prior technical problems had been corrected. I chanced another purchase and this time the DVD-R works fine."
1,The Best Man,Again Amazon is not providing any details about the DVD -- is it in the correct aspect ratio or is it a pan and scan print? The movies from the various archive series are targeted against collectors. Collectors want to know this stuff. Amazon provide your customers with the information they need to make an informed buying decision. Knowing what I know from the description I'm only able to give this a single star. I should be able to rate the DVD listing as being incomplete.
4,HEY!!,"It was a pretty good movie, but it seems Gore Vidal is always writing ""gay"" themes into his stuff. I can never figure that out."
3,MGM DVD-R aspect ratio,"The following pertains to the MGM DVD-R release of ""The Best Man"" (1964). The only aspect ratio information on the back of the DVD case is a single word, ""FULLSCREEN,"" which is contrary to the correct aspect ratio of 1.66:1.Addendum: Having reviewed the disc since my earlier comment, the film is on screen in the correct aspect ratio of 1.66:1, but this is letterboxed for 4:3 (standard) televisions. So on a 16:9 television, the viewer must accept either the sharpest image possible, but at a significantly smaller than optimal image size for the TV, or play with the TV's zoom setting to get a bigger (but full) image, with reduced sharpness."
5,dvdr plays well!,"This is a fine, suspenseful, well-acted film about the long-lost time when political conventions had stances to decide and candidates to choose. I don't do reviews, but this is necessary information.I bought this film in the spring of 2010. It stalled half-way through, and nothing could make it play beyond that point. I complained, and Amazon sent me another. They never checked it out. Same problem exactly.Having seen recent reviews indicating that the problem had been corrected, I ordered a third copy in January 2011 (I really like this movie). I just watched it. All the way through. Pristine print. It was worth all the trouble.I have no way of knowing whether all copies are now playable, but there's a good chance they are."
3,"Familiar Theme, but well Executed","THE BEST MAN returns to familiar political territory, by focusing on the campaign for the nomination of a party candidate. William Russell (Henry Fonda), and Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson) are the adversaries; it seems as if they will stop at nothing to achieve their ends, including defamation of character. However Fonda, in one of his familiar roles as the person upholding right, understands that there is something more than simply receiving the nomination, and undergoes a change of character; the decision might not lead to political success, but it leaves him with a clear conscience and helps him sustain his marriage to his wife (Margaret Leighton). Gore Vidal's screenplay takes some familiar swipes at the American governmental system, but the film is redeemed by its drama-documentary style (shot in grainy black-and-whits) and by director Franklin Schaffner's brisk, no-nonsense structure that sustains the attention through the 90 minute running time."
5,The Best Man,"Excellent (albeit idealized) look into politics circa 1960. wonderful acting by all the principles. Doubt it would occur today, but would like to think that there are some left in politics who would sacrifice themselves for their country."
3,Good example of a biker film,"I have no idea how many stars to give this. I hovered between three and four. If you're looking for a little known ""typical"" yet above average example of this genre, then this one will fit your needs. However it's not that great a movie and I would not recommend it unless you are curious about biker films or already enjoy them. (I collect them.) The story has a plot. The characters are somewhat sleazy but not too sleazy. The story has a resolution. There's a biker gang that rides around on motorcycles and looks for trouble as the protagonists, but they're not a full on bunch of raging sociopaths. Acting is not terribly great but not as bad as some. Lots of bongo dancing. No dune buggies or chimps. The sheriff is portrayed sympathetically along with most of the towns people."
3,"Three Stars for ""OK""","This is an average Kismet romance from 1993 repackaged as a Black Satin Romance. According to my book Susan Macias aka Susan Mallery had one other romance published before this. The hero, Jack Baldwin, is an aggessive lone wolf who targets companies and ""devours them like candy"". He needs Lauren Reese with her background in Japanese culture. This is a different game and he is determined to win.There is her initial refusal to work for him which she changes within 24 hours. He manipulates, she wants to change him for the better, they go to bed, have words, make up and he realizes he can't live without her. This review is short and to the point. I think three stars is generous and honestly wish I spent my time reading another book. If you enjoy Ms. Mallery and want to read an earlier work look for it as a used Kismet and pay less or try your local library."
5,"Great product, fast shipping!",I received all my dishes in perfect condition. They were all packaged well and they were shipped very fast!
5,great big mug,"The fiesta cappuccino mug is much bigger than I thought it would be, and just perfect for a substantial serving of cappuccino, coffee, cocoa, latte... Its thick walls hold the heat, and you can whisk the milk without splattering. I gave it to my brother for Christmas -- he is a coffee freak -- and he loved it. I got it in white, which is very handsome. All in all, a great gift. Of course I'm thinking of getting one for myself too."
1,Recycled Photos from Taunton,"The Taunton Press has published some excellent books - I especially like ""Built-Ins"". But this books seems to have been thrown together with little thought or integrity. Featured are numerous pictures that can been seen in their other books; this recycling of images is an affront to the reader - I never forget a photograph, and feel ripped-off when I recognize it from a different book.The Taunton Press should re-think its strategy; re-hashing previous publications and slapping on a new title is lazy, unoriginal, and insulting to its readership."
4,Got the job done. Easy to install.,Needed a card to run the DVI cable as the Dell 2400 only had a VGA output. Promptly received and it was very easy to install and get up and running. No complaints here.I have no way to determine how it might work with gamers and the likes but for internet surfing it is just fine. Very much recommended. I give it four stars simply because I can't rate it's gaming abilities but if only on my experience would rate it at five stars. Hope this distinction makes sense. It would make no sense for me to have purchased a device costing five times as much for a use I would never use. Price was certainly right.
5,Swarovski Crystal Bracelet,"I waited much too long to order the bracelet and expect it by Christmas. I was extremely surprised and delighted that it arrived in the mail on Christmas Eve, even though I expected it several days after Christmas. The item was packaged extremely well and was exactly as I imagined it would look. Needless to say, my wife was thrilled when she opened up the package on Christmas day. Thank you so much for such a quick turnaround!"
1,Junk,"Easy to describe--the price should have told me; if it's cheap in price, it's cheap in quality and looks."
3,Golf glove,I like being able to purchase gloves in so many colors but have found the life of these gloves is short. Wear on the palm quickly.
4,Not bad at all - should try,"I received the gloves both left and right, they are very nice and well made. I love to wear a pair during practice. I recommended this style to my friends. The fingers and the palm size are running smaller than the Fila,and the other European or Japanese brands. Medium is a bit tight on me, I am wearing 21cm. If you have longer fingers, size Large might be better. It is a pity that the beautiful British green is not available for purchase."
2,"Look and feel good, wear out really fast","The color and feel is good when new, my wife was pretty happy with these gloves. Unfortunately, after 2 rounds, the leathery-like outer layer had worn away, leaving a material like inner layer exposed."
4,Stampington's usual superb collection of artist's works.,"This book was produced by sending out project basics to various artists, and allowing them to finish the work any way they wished. The only qualifier was what colors were to be used on which projects. The results are all one would expect from a varied group of talented artists."
5,Overflowing with inspiration!,"Absolutely the best art book I've ever bought! So much inspiration throughout this book. Every page in it features an amazing piece of art. All of the artists are talented and use color so well. It's actually inspired me to start using colors I would normally avoid. I've literally spent hours and hours looking through all of the amazing examples throughout this book. Each time I look at it, I always see something new. Definitely one of most inspiring books ever created!"
4,The Best Shooter for the PS2 Yet!,"This is by far the best Guncon2 game for the PS2. The action is fast paced and the graphics are suburb. The story line is weak and boring, but that is not why most people play a shooting game anyways. The game its self is not terribly long, but no shooter really is. A good piece of advice would be to take it easy on the Guncon2 light-gun. Though they are very accurate they are also very fragile, remember squeeze the trigger don't yank it. If you like shooting games you can not go wrong here. Some other decent Guncon2 games you might want to check out are ""Vampire Night"" and ""Ninja Assault"". See You Space Cowboy."
5,time crisis 3,"i have time crisis 1,2&3 i enjoy all 3 of them if you big into shooting games its a must have fast paced and in your face need to make every shot count.i love the light gun games.makes you feel like your right there in the action.some of the light gun games can be played with out the light gun but why would you want to that takes all the fun out of it and it makes it all most imposible to play because you have to weight for the dot to get to the person and the games don't slow down for you so if you don't have a light gun don't waste your time."
2,er... not good,"People, I don't know what you see in this game. It's not really a bad game, it's just an average arcade shooter. More often than not, I can't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly. I pop out from behind something and I'm dead meat. Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game."
4,Detailed Information-not for all readers,"I bought On a Wing and a Prayer because I really felt like reading about airline disasters. I bought it on a whim, partly because the cover looked interesting and partly because I am interested in aviation. I found the book interesting, but it was alittle too detailed for my liking.On a Wing and a Prayer not only includes cockpit voice transcripts and alerts, but passenger analysis. In other words, you don't just get the story about the accident, but all the in-depth coverage as well.Overall, I really didn't like the book because it was too detailed. I would not recommend this book to anyone that just wants to read about disasters. However, if you really like books that break down things step by step, On a Wing and a Prayer is the book for you."
2,Plane honest truth,"Displays human characteristics under stress, the positives and the negatives. Provides only ""snap shots"" of what happened in various disasters. Not a bad book although I wouldn't recommend it as a present . . ."
4,Freeze and Slash 2,"I agree with the comments of the 'Freeze and Slash' review above, and have only a few things to add. The game has a bit of platforming, requiring you to switch between forms, but there is rarely much complexity to it (stealth/lizard form can climb on visually marked tracks, sword/human form can jump, gun/giant can shoot obstacles). The game requires some shifting between forms, but players can often get away with using one chosen form for the majority of combat, with the exception being boss battles. Overrall, a fun game, but one that could have been better.p.s. Buy the Gun Form's creature grenade upgrade at some point in the middle of the game, you need it for the final boss"
5,Very great book on carving caricatures,This book has some very great detail and instruction on how to carve great looking wood caricatures. This is also a great reference book.
5,The Best!,This book is the best learning book ever! You get deatils on how to make your project come out great! I would totally recommend this book to all woodcarvers. Thanks!
5,Amazing Lens,"Before buying this lens, I have owned a canon 70-200 f/4L IS, Canon 70-200 f/2.8L IS, Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 and Sigma 70-200 f/2.8 but sold them as I need a lens that is light and versatile. My first shot of this lens so sharp and vivid, this is now my favourite portrait lens, highly recommended."
3,Type II,"This lens was purchased for use with the XTI. For me this replaced a 300mm F2.8 FD on an F1. The detachable lens shade is frail and bulky and therefore of little use to me (the discontinued Type I apparently had a built in hood). The tripod ring should be kitted with the lens, not sold as an accessory. Images with 1.4 & 2X extenders appear softer than they should be at maximum aperture. I think my results with the 300 plus extenders (and film) more consistant. Having said that, advanges include ability to use conventional filters (77mm polarizer) and great savings in weight, bulk, and cost for essentially the same field of view."
5,Mi lente favorito,"Lo adquiri casi nuevo en Costa Rica, con parasol y bolsa por $400, o sea una ganga. He tenido muchos lentes fijos y zoom de la línea L todos buenos. Pero ninguno supera al 200 f/28 en resolución, detalle, color, etc. Este lente se ha convertido en mi favorito a pesar de que no posee estabilizador de imagen. No es apto para fotografía nocturna pero de día para fotografía de personas y naturaleza es insuperable. Para aprovecharlo al 100 por ciento se requiere practicar el enfoque con objetivos pequeños como ojos de aves, flores pequeñas, etc.Si lo consiguen usado o nuevo comprenlo y no se van a arrepentir, pero deben tener en cuenta que es fijo y uno debe acercarse o alejarse, o sea es bueno para ejercitarse, lo que es un plus. SUPER LENTE!"
4,Great lens,"Don't let the reviews make you think this is RAZOR sharp. I would have expected better from a prime L lens. However, this lens is still quite sharp. I would have wished for IS but, of course, that would have raised the price to a place that I don't have money for right now.Just know what you need a lens for and see if this matches. A prime at this focal length will mean a lot of walking around to frame your subject.Makes a great match for my 40D"
4,Unique Art Style,I really like the bird anatomy section. Bird anatomy is kind of hard to come by--I'm not talking about chicken anatomy. This artist has a very interesting style.
4,"Good, clear book","I write this review as a frequent reader of physics books, not a professional of physics. I have found the book very clear. It gives a good overview of the Standard Model, avoiding the most speculative and innovative theories that are the focus of most of the best-seller books in the last years. It is easy to understand, although you need to have certain knowledge in particle physics, and provides with a good introduction to the main ""confirmed"" theories in this field.I have not awarded the fifth star because I think there are other books that are superior to this, such as ""Deep Down Things"" or ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" (with a different scope). Anyway, my global perception is that it is a very good book."
3,"Better than average ""Field Guide""","As a professional physicist, I can attest to the difficulty of learning the Standard Model and of internalizing its intuitions. Oerter is obviously inspired by the style of the popularizations of Richard Feynman, and he comes close to the mark. This book could be viewed as a sequel to Feynman's superb ""QED"", which I suspect more than a few pros keep hidden in the bottom drawer of their desks for the occasional breath of clarity when struggling through the dense thickets of actual calculations.I knock the book two whole stars for the author's inexplicable self-indulgence in political smears (page 53) and time-wasting distractions of using ""her"" when referring to male cartoons (e.g. pages 46 and 123). I was just enjoying his otherwise good narrative when for no apparent reason he just couldn't resist showing me his place in the lunatic zeitgeist. Tsk tsk."
3,"Only worth the $$ for the ""scene""","Otherwise, this item is a cheap imitation of The Crush, Fear, Swimfan, etc. But I like Molly - it was nice to see her in a different type of role, as well as the ""scene"" most people buy this movie for!"
3,Not that great,"Bought it because I vaguely remembered seeing it quite a while ago. Thought I remembered that it was a good movie. Of course, the real attraction is Molly Ringwald, with her physical attributes on display. Yeah, they are real, and they're lovely. The movie...not so hot."
5,You call this one.,Mediocre story. Mediocre acting. Molly Ringwald in her prime. Molly Ringwald topless. 5 Stars for Molly. You call it.
1,molly ringwald at her finest,did you like pretty in pink and all her cutest roles while this one will undoubtedly catch you off guard an erotic thiller......
3,"Molly's looking good!!! Movie isn't too bad either, but not great.","Not a bad flick. I don't remember the plot, but remember Molly. If you are a Molly Ringwald fan, you will enjoy the movie. Some waist up frontal nudity from Molly, but nothing terribly vulgar."
3,Molly Ringwald Will Never Be the Same,"This is a typical Fatal Attraction type movie. Nothing new or special (actually, it's a pretty bad film)....except that you get to see Molly Ringwald's breasts. Hey, if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. But I grew up in the 80's and I just can't get past the fact that The Breakfast Club's Claire is showing her boobs now. It's just weird."
2,If it werent a baseball player ...,"... this movie could have earned two stars more. This teenage version of Fatal Attraction is not without merits - the main character, a troubled girl played very convincingly by Molly Ringwald, is very well sketched but for some reasen the action had to be 'spiced up' by a whole array of totally improbable incidents. The aspiring game star angle is for another age group than mine (over 40)."
3,not bad,"Not a bad litte film ,it's faults are compensated for by the interest generated by Ringwald's departure from type. Good for her--she's not bad and the movie is watchable."
5,"THE TINDER BOX, RARE HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSON FIND",REALLY HARD TO FIND HANS STORY ON THIS DVD. THERE WERE A FEW VERSIONS MADE WHICH I SAW ON T.V. AS A CHILD WHICH DO NOT EXIST TODAY. LOOKED EVERYWHERE ! THE MOST MEMORABLE SHOWED THE 3 DOGS PROGRESSIVELY LARGER WHERE DOG NUMBER 3 WAS THE SIZE OF A 4 STORY BUILDING. THIS VERSION TELLS THE STORY VERY WELL AND FITS RIGHT IN TO VIEW FROM THANKSGIVING TO CHRISTMAS WHEN IT WAS TRADITIONALLY SHOWN ON T.V. MANY YEARS AGO. I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD; GREAT FUN FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND A GREAT FAMILY ORIENTED STORY. THIS DVD ALSO HAS OTHER GOOD HCA STORIES....AMAZON HAD THIS DVD FOR SALE AT A GOOD PRICE AND THEIR VAST INVENTORY IS THE FIRST PLACE I LOOK FOR HARD TO FIND ITEMS !
4,Artist and song listings,"Artist, band, and song listngs on this compilation are as follows: Spoon: Not Turning Off, Railroad Jerk: Rollercoaster, Yo La Tengo:From A Motel 6, Guided By Voices: Motor Away, Pizzicato 5: Twiggy Twiggy, Silkworm: Wet Firecracker, Bettie Serveert: Palomine, Pavement: Cut Your Hair, Helium: Pat's Trick, Run On: Christmas Trip, Liz Phair: Jealousy, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion: Flavor, Chavez: Unreal Is Here, and Chain Gang: Satanic Rockers. No running time listed."
2,"Peppy collection of videos, slowed by ""storyline""","You get some pretty all right videos on this Matador collection--though the videos are nowhere near as good as the CD compilation. The Liz Phair video is very tongue-in-cheek, as is her ironic performance as a rock star in the ""interview."" There are some other fine music videos on this tape, but nothing that really honors the medium or explores the possibilities: these are pretty much cut and dry, low-budget music videos. Unfortunately, the whole tape is interpersed with cutesy little segments about Matador, which are rather boring. You can always fast-forward, but ultimately the humor segments and some weak videos collapse the value of the whole tape and leave the viewer feeling uninspired."
2,Garbage Formatting,"Good info for a writing course, but the formatting is awful. First off, the book is a weird shape (for a book, that is). It's difficult to find a place for it on the shelf, and it's awkward to carry around in a backpack.The format is definitely creative, but it's a pain in the rear for anybody who likes a clean, logical flow. Your eyes have to randomly wander all over the pages to pickup all the details."
3,A little less spectacular,"3 1/2While not being the full-fledged, note-by-note knockout composition fans of the challenging yet groovy post rock quintet expected, IAAY reveals many subtle production gifts throughout its less distinctly brilliant brevity."
3,a resounding OK,"Well, despite these mixed reviews I decided to buy it anyway based on a recent article about them in the Boston Globe. I don't have, nor have i ever heard, any Tortoise before this. I am a fan of other 'bands' categorized under the ambiguous genre of Post Rock. I have to give this one an OK, and nothing more. I like the first 3 tracks and then at times it gets quite boring. I also agree with the sentiment here that there little feeling in the playing. Too programmed. The comparison of Crest to Zappa is a good one, but I also think that's one of the better songs on the disk. After reading these other reviews I may go buy some older Tortoise. Anyway, it was worth the 12 bucks."
3,A Slow Descent Into Blandness,"Did any fan of this band ever have to debate whether ""Millions Living Will Never Die"" or ""Tortoise"" were good albums? Most likely not. It's possible a fan might argue which of these albums they preferred, but the originality and musicianship were unmistakable. I think that ""TNT"" is right up there with those two albums and to a lesser extent ""Standards"" holds some strong character to it.This albums is unquestionably the low point in the Tortoise catalogue. ""Crest"" is so derivative of Frank Zappa circa '79 that one could think it's a cover song. ""The Lithium Stiffs"" proves once and for all that The Manhattan Transfer is not a band worth emulating. While the rest of the songs just sound like Tortoise doing the same old thing (a retread of albums TNT and Standards) which is to say they don't sound very exciting about the music they're making. If they're going to repeat themselves why not make a ""Millions Living Will Never Die II"" instead of a ""Standards V""."
1,didn't notice any changes,My cats hated this and I didn't notice any changes in allergies. I think it's the same as spraying them with water.
5,Great product.,Works great. Good sturdy design. Can use on a variety of different fruits and veggies.
3,Ok,"I purchased this last year to make my first apple pie. It worked well, but when I came to use it this year, I had to put it back together for each apple. Good thing I only had 5 apples to core and cute. Not sure what happened. Don't know if the kids dropped it. But I think it's a good buy. I would purchase another one and take better care of it."
5,Sharp Slicer,I am so pleased with this gadget. It is hard to find a 12-piece slicer. It is great for baking apple pies. It is also wonderful to simply slice up an apple and snack. Very pleased with this purchase. Be careful the blades are sharp and you should rinse immediately after use or place in the dishwasher for easy cleaning.
3,"OK, but it could be sharper","I bought this model primarily because it would handle larger apples, and it is very big. However, I am not happy with the sharpness of the blades, especially in the center hub. It requires more force than it should to begin cutting, and it will not cut all the way through the skin at the bottom of the apple. It should be okay for peeled apples for pies, but not so much for unpeeled apples for snacking."
1,Not the apple of MY eye,"Boy, this sure looked good on the screen, arrived and was hefty, seemed sturdy. We are apple eaters so I was in heaven for a while. However, after about 6 months just yesterday, it fell apart into unconnected pieces--completely beyond repair. What a disappointment. It didn't even last as long as the $5 cheapo I got at Big Lots. This is a top dollar item and should have lasted so much longer."
1,Only works well for softer apples,"I have only used this about 10-15 times on cold fresh apples and one of the joints is already about to snap. Only buy this if you want to use it on soft mealy apples. The ""heavyweight"" constructions is not so heavy. I have gone back to using a knife - simpler and no extra tools needed."
2,Works ok while it lasts.,I bought this slicer both for apple pies and to slice apples to snack on. The slicer works well on most apples but when I was trying to slice an apple with an uneven top the whole assembly popped apart and was not easy to reassemble. I would recommend searching for another slicer as I am about to do.
5,new and improved,"I own all three of Ellis' CDs, as well as some recordings of Bobby Llama. This has a similar feel to Blueprint, but I think it is much more mature. At the last live show I attended, Ellis commented that she has grown a lot and is learning more about herself and I think that's evident here. You see her softer, more melodic side as well as her more usual fun, faster songs. A great CD that shows great promise for albums to come as well."
3,Doesn't compare to Apple's own,"This software is a set of diverse software instruments that can be used in Apple's GarageBand program, however, the usefulness and practicality of most of the instruments is limited in my experience. There are some good instruments included, but this ExpansionPack doesn't compare to the Apple Jam Packs. They are far superior, even if you just compare the software instruments."
2,"Yassuh, boss!","Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.THE MONSTER WALKS (1932) - Rex Lease, Vera Reynolds, Sheldon Lewis, Vera Reynolds, Wille BestOne of the most racially insensitive pictures of all time! Willie Best (as 'Sleep 'n' Eat') shucks 'n' jives his way through a lot of bug-eyed mugging and ""feets don' fail me now!"" dialogue. The story's last line is Best saying the monster monkey looks like his uncle! INCREDIBLE. Not for the politically correct."
1,close,I'm going to be short.1) the game is fun.2) grphics arnt bad but just not good.3) story is just fine but not to engaging.4) the game takes a sort of feird turn tword the end.5) the game is chalenging.6) wepon veriety is good.In short if you realy want a fps get killzone. If you dont like the realizm of killzone get this game.
1,Just fustrated,"I cant see the where the folks who gave even ok to this product came from, I found teh controls so difficult to use after hrs of playing i still couldnt finish the 1st mission. Move forward and reverse on 1 stick, turn left and right on the other. I couldnt handle it and probably wont even try agian im so fustrated."
4,Could have been a real challange to HALO,"The action and story in this game is intense and captures you from the first battle. The one down side to this game is that the graphics are just average at best. With such a great story and pulse pounding action I am disappointed with the lack of detail in the graphics. The graphics remind of DOOM or Duke Nukem, not what you expect in todays gaming world.But with that said the story in this game is fun, new, and exciting. All of things I have been missing in first person PS2 games. With better graphics this game could have challanged HALO easily."
3,"An ill-fitting, cheap knock-off... But it works.","Well, I must say I was expecting something a little closer to the official Microsoft Play-n-Charge cable, and while this does function in the same way-- being an obvious Chinese clone-- it seems to be made of cheaper materials and has a shorter cord.It fits the controller poorly, but does fit. It charges and plays as advertised, but let's just say the price is right and I'm willing to overlook the overall feel of the cable considering what I paid for it.If you're in need of a way to charge your battery packs, then this is OK and worth the price. If you're looking for something to play games with, I'd say go for something a bit more sturdy and with a longer cord."
3,Works,"Off brand but does the job, If your looking for a cheap replacement this will work. Have a good day."
4,Does whats its supposed to,Does what its built for. Unfortunately the color doesn't match my controllers very well. I lost my old one that came with my halo 3 edition 360. Still wonder where that went too. I like to plug this cable into my computer to charge it. Its nice and quiet and the xbox doesn't have to run to charge.
3,An alternative to charging your 360 controllers,"The play and charge kit cable is yet another proprietary piece of hardware handed down from Microsoft. It fulfills its purpose and allows you to charge your controllers. Noting less, nothing more; and of course you can only use this with Microsoft's proprietary rechargeable battery. Though I may say my charge cable came with a rather strong led light. The main problem with the cable is that is breaks easily and its life is rather short."
2,Get the Brand name,Makes a static noise in your headset while its charging and also makes a static noise through your mic for everyone else to hear. This makes it impossible to play while charging. Kind of a waste of money.
3,"Come out, come out, DJ Faust, wherever you are","OK, Faust may be the finest turntablism practitioner there is. Yes, 'Man or Myth?' hinted at a breadth of vision sufficient to create a masterpiece, an album weighty enough to transcend the rather severe limitations of the genre. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Many of the tracks are mind-bogglingly good. Some of the scratching is not to be missed. But the ""concept""--dividing the record into constituent ""elements"" of Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth--seems an afterthought at best, and a tired one at that. It provides no coherent framework for the material, and you will have abandoned the project on grounds of tedium long before reaching its finest moment, 'The Phoenix', the last of 25 tracks."
4,Christmas Cook Book,The Martha Stewart Christmas Cook Book is really great! There are alot of pictures and sooo many recepies. I've already tried some and are all great and delicious!
5,Christmas Cookbook,"Cooking Light Holiday CookbookSeriously Simple Holidays: Recipes and Ideas to Celebrate the Season""Cooking Enthusiast"" Gift Basket by Zawadi African TeaCooking Light Holiday CookbookSome the most cherished memories have to do with the celebration of the holidays. Christmas is about family traditions, and holiday entertaining-- and a lot about fun and food."
4,Worth reading....,"I am somewhat a WWII history buff, so I am not objective, but I really liked this book. I remember seeing a movie about this when I was a kid with Steve McQueen jumping fences with his motorcycle... This is the real story, not the stylized Hollywood tale. The thought of being in a small diameter tunnel, hundreds of yards from the opening in the barracks and digging with rudimentary tools makes one shudder. The odds that these guys faced between detection and tunnel collapse, are amazing."
2,not very effective,"I bought this item to keep my new kitten from chewing on my things. He hated the smell when I held some up to him on a paper towel, but it really didn't deter him from chewing. I won't be buying this item again."
4,The only true Azeri source of historical information,"For a long time I wanted to get a view on Karabakh from a perspective of an Azeri historian. I would like to note that unlike many now day's historians, Mirza Jamal did not pursue political ends in exploring the history of the region. His was simply writing history for the sake of history not political implications. This made him unbiased towards Armenians and Aeries.I highly recommend this book especially if you would like to get an unbiased glance of Azeri historian on region of Karabakh."
2,Disappointed Pugni fan,"I agree with almost everything the Pugni lover says about this video-- but he only takes off one star for poor video quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how nicely a black-clad dancer is performing against a black background with poor (1982!) Soviet recording facilities. And I would point to the same DVD as that reviewer for the best ""Pas de Quartre""-- Nina Ananiashvili's 2 vol. International Stars set. But I would also point out that some of the selections on this flawed View Video production are on that same set: for example, Satanella and the Flower Festival at Genzano (better danced, as well as recorded, in my view). Also, the well-recorded Kultur DVD ""Kirov Classics"" includes the wonderful Pugni pas de six (Markitenka). In short, although there is not as much Pugni available as we would like (how about a full-length Esmeralda?), one doesn't have to be spoiled to pass on View Video, which is laced with marketing for their other offerings like ""Massage Your Mate."""
4,Now/Again,This book is a journey for those of you who had the good fortune as a young listener to relive the great adventures of a mottley crew of detectives who ventured to some very unlikely places. One week a South American temple in the jungle with their own vampires or a story of a magican who turns his aid into a wolf;adventures are spelled out in detail. This paper wonderland is an accumulation of all the shows and stars broadcast over the life of the show.
5,This item is more than it appears in a picture!,"Mr. Christmas' Gold Label ""The Night Before Christmas House,"" will bring the child-like amazement of Christmas to any one, of any age, in any home. Although other companies have attempted to offer similar products, nothing compares to the beauty and splendor of this. As the Night Before Christmas story is told, the figurines ""move"" in the appropriate rooms. The background music and sound effects add to the wonderment of this product. I highly recommend this Gold Label House; it surely will become the centerpiece of Christmas decorations now and for years to come. Buy and enjoy!"
2,"Nice game, but not for very long","The game has nice graphics and good user controls. The biggest bummer is that you cannot save your progress. So every time you start the game you always start on the same starting level. This gets old. Only if you finish an episode (multiple levels - which can take over and hour) can you then ""skip"" forward to the next level upon start."
4,6 Year Old Can't Put it Down,"I bought this for my son's 6th birthday. He has not been able to put it down. It is a very basic play concept which made it easy for him to pick it up and run with it. I do think an adult would be bored quickly.We have not been able to find out how to unlock the later levels but hopefully, he will as much fun when we do."
3,8 yr old plays game,This game was purchased for my grandchildren and they find it a bit difficult at times but still try to play it.
3,Different brand than the picture,"The picture shows Rugby brand, but I received Geri-Care brand. The strengths are the same, but the image is misleading. Buyer beware."
4,good product,"Good product, fast shipping. One point. The label states that it contains 50mg of zinc. I called the manufacturer and they explained that 220 mg of zinc sulfate has 50 mg of actual zinc. Go figure......"
2,"Good graphics, o.k. game play, lousy story","The story contained in this game develops like a bad anime. Essentially you are plucked from the streets of Metropolis due to your potential as a great race car driver (based on the fact that you can drive an ambulance real fast). You start to work essentially for organized crime, but eventually you move on your own to start your own racing team with friends (the mob lets you go if you win one race, beacue its the right thing to do). You do not really have any competition.The graphics of this game are excellent, though repetitive. While the car races are fun intially, they too become repetetive. Your car upgrades do not really accomplish anything.Unfortunately, I bought this game when it first came out for $60. If I had bought it for its current reduced price I would have given it an extra half of star."
1,Ouch!!! Worst Racer on Xbox!!!!!,"AVOID this STEAMING PILE!!! R: Racing Evolution is probably the worst racing game on the Xbox system. I don't know what these other reviewers were smoking, but you better not pay any money for this garbage. Yeah, the graphics are decent, but the stearing is absolutely awful. The controls, gas & brakes & reverse are stupidly badly done. Idoit savants programmed this trash. There are only 2 camera views for driving. The physics are non existant. You will hate this game. Trust me. Oh, unless you like a lotta techno music. Then you will lo-o-o-o-o-o-ve this peice of [...]."
4,The 4th Koko Book - The Horrible Red,"This is the 4th book in ""The Cat Who..."" Series. I strongly recommend you to read this series in sequence. It is deeper and more interesting as a serial story, such as how the friendship between Qwilleran and Koko deepens, Qwill's changeful life and so on.I always find the titles are intriguing in this series. What is the ""Red"" Koko saw...that's horrible! It's rather unusual for this light-hearted and amusing series."
5,Still wonderful!,"I recently re-read this , recalling it as one of my all time favorite mysteries,and it still entertained. With all the current mystery writer wannabe's out there, it's good to know Braun still delivers."
1,Odd book...I just don't get the hype,"The Cat Who Saw Red is supposed to be a murder/mystery book, but I can't say it really suceeded. The book was more about what food was being eaten (as the main character has just taken up a food critic column) and what the cats were doing. The end was very unsatisfying and seemed to be tacked on in two sentences to sum up the book. I didn't expect much going into it, but got less than I expected. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good read,Brilliantly entertaining as usual with some edginess that is missing from the Moose County installments. Quaint and quirky. Three cheers for Qwill.
1,Horrible Horrible item,"This is a horrible item, I bought it for 30.00 because I need to wear it for a strapless dress. It not only didn't stick well, I couldn't even hold it up. Don't even think about cleavage, it's not strong enough to hold it up. Also the cup was not big enough to fit. Now I'm stuck with a 30 piece of garbage I will never be able to use anymore."
3,okay,"To begin, I'm a d and a half really.... too much for a d, not quite enough for a dd, so I knew this would probably be small and it is/was. I have made it work anyway on at least 4 occasions now and it seems to be loosing it's stick already, which is really disappointing because I followed all the directions of application and washing. Will definitely not be buying this again."
1,Nooobra,"The Nubra Feather-Lite is the worst bra ever. It's not ""freedom and movement."" I've worn it once to the movie theater. Never again! When I put it on, I was very aware of it sticking to me. The silicone cups allow no air circulation so I was sweating and the Nubra was coming off. The front closure wouldn't stay closed. I couldn't move much for fear of the Nubra falling off. I resorted to sneakily squishing it against my chest to try and make it stick.The worst part is it looks bad. It's not ""smooth and invisible under sheer clothing."" The top and sides of the cups created an obvious outline under my shirt that didn't even look like the bra-line of a normal bra. You can see why in the picture; the edges jut out. The cups create an unnatural shape. The cups should start very thin at the top and sides and get gradually thicker. Then, the Nubra would seamlessly fit, like an extension of the body. It doesn't. It looks off."
1,Don't buy it,"I purchased a C cup which was really like a AA cup. To send it back, you would have to pay 10 %, so you wouldn't get a full refund...and you have to pay shipping. So it would not benefit to send it back at all. So I bought the bra and cannot use it. Not happy."
4,Great for when you can't wear a regular bra!,"I bought this bra to go with a dress that was cut way too low to wear a bra. I am a 32C and bought the B cup which worked out just fine. It took me 2 tries to get it on right, but once you learn how it's super easy! (My best tip is to start from the side and work towards the front). No, it is not like wearing a regular bra, probably more like wearing a strapless. But it does what it's suppose to and fairly comfortable considering it's sticking onto you. I would definitely recommend it, but I don't think it's something you would want to wear regularly."
2,This is a D-cup???,"A D-cup? Really? I read that these bras run small, but this is ridiculous! I gave the product two stars because of its excellent sticking ability, but what good does that do me if the bra doesn't fit? I'm a large C, so I ordered the D. I think a D-cup would fit a woman (or an unfortunate man) with no more than a B cup. It barely covers my nipples. What a waste of money."
2,Choose the Un Bra Instead,"I bought this after my Un Bra went missing, which I LOVE. This version is twice the price and is simply not made to fit the standard width chest. Its too narrow, only covering an inch or so outside the nipple. The result? No support at all. Its like putting a napkin over your chest. In comparison, the Un Bra actually cups your entire breast making you feel less naked."
3,Not worth it,"Bought this for my wedding day and I sweated it off before I walked down the isle. I'm not a heavy sweater, but the wedding was outdoors in Texas in May so it was pretty humid. If you have an indoor event you'll probably be fine, but take a pass if you'll be outside for longer than a few minutes. It did make everything look good and was very comfortable while it was on."
5,Worked perfect,I needed a bra with no back to wear with a dress that was sheer in the back. This was easy to put on and stayed in place all night. I was very impressed!
3,NuBra,"I liked this bra, but I wished that it could be worn more than once. The stickyness didn't last more than a couple uses."
4,I was skeptical,"I really like this product. It was a little weird at first, with the sticking the bra to my skin but it really works. Not totally recommended to wear with a tube top if you can help it but it's wonderful with halter tops and backless items. *It really helps to clean it immediately after wearing. Makes the bra last much much longer.*"
1,Ughh,"I bought this adhesive bra and am not sure if the manufacturers have ever seen a D cup breast. When I got the bra home I was so excited to try it as I was planning on taking it to go beneath my little black dress while in Paris. Boy was I disappointed to see that the cup barely even covered 1/4 of my breast! I thought this product may work well from A/B cups so I had my daughter try it who was also disappointed. Although the cup is small, if all you are looking for is a little something to cover the nipples (and only the nipples) this would probably work well."
1,Horrible!!!!! no star,"if you're a 38C as I am, forget it! Total waste of money, for something that only covers your breast nipples."
5,Amazing product,"I've had my original NuBra for a year and it's still very much usable, i'm about to purchase a second one though as the first one is losing it's stick around the edges and is a little grimey. I have no idea how others say it comes off, i've sweat through mine and though the fabric on the front may get stained, the stick holds.. i end up prying it off at the end of the night. It's the greatest thing invented for clothing with open, low, or funky cut backs. It's also barely noticeable under skin tight items. I'm a lifetime fan.Also since I know it makes all the difference in the world, I'm a B cup, I've heard that for larger cup sizes it doesn't work as well and gives no support. That's unfortunate, it works wonders for me."
1,Does not fit!,"This was something that I thought sounded great!When It arrived, I tried it right away. It does not work at all for as it is not wide enough when clasped to cover the sides of my breasts. Perhaps I should have gone with a B instead."
5,"Very well priced, sleek design, performs nicely","Noticed a slight quality improvement in cable HD channels, but no noticeable difference in audio quality.I bought this to get a decent spike/surge protector for my newly bought system (42"" Panasonic plasma and a Yamaha HT).Very stylish cabinet, great looking sleek design."
1,Not the best build quality,"I have gone through 2 units in less than 5 months. The problem is a failure of the switched power function, which occurred in a short period of usage. Four outlets are unswitched, but four (audio) are switched on/off with the front switch button. The switch button no longer works and the rear reset does not fix the problem. With this failure I am stuck with a four outlet conditioner with four bad switched outlets. Belkin will repair/replace, but I have to pay shipping costs. Hard choice. I would recommend looking for a better quality device."
3,Very Cool,"The big hits plus strong lesser known songs like ""Sweet Child of Mine(Wait for the Ricochet)"" Very prominent rock organ."
4,A nice collection of papers,"The book is a collection of diverse papers on inverse problems. The papers cover different applications and different techniques applied to inverse problems.For a starter on inverse problems, the book presents the latest work and provides pointers to follow up the content. This will save a lot of boring library work :)"
2,Poorly Written book,"This is a very poorly written book; for example, a sentence on page 63 says: ""Once my opponent's leg is passed, I will shift my body toward my opponent's head in order to secure a better hold."" Revising it yields: Once my opponent's leg is passed, I shift my body toward his head securing a better hold. Mr Simco repeatedly uses a passive voice and unnecessarily repeats subject phrases when simple pronouns will work; the cumulative effect of so many dead words is a very cluttered book that would have been much better if well edited. I have the sense reading it that the author knows far more about martial art than the art of writing."
4,A good start,"This is a good start if you are new to BJJ. Gene covers some of the ""basics"". however, if you are not real new to the art I would look eleswhere"
1,Very Poor,I really don't understand how this book can get 5 stars.The actual content isn't too bad but what really brings it down is the layout and the photos. Most of the photos are tiny and combined with the poor quality paper they seem faded making it hard to distinguish what is going on.I am waiting on a few other BJJ books I have purchased based on 5 star reviews.I'm now a little bit woried that they will only be as good as this book which I think is very poor.The DVD however isn't too bad. Some good stuff there.I was going to give 2 stars due to the DVD but this is a book review sostuff it just 1 star.
4,Great Start Up Book and Sample DVD,"Okay, I wanted to get more fundamentals learned in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). So I decided to pick up this book. It has great photos for instruction. You can follow them pretty easily. The dvd is a sample dvd. It's pretty good when it comes to showing you the technique. But in no way is it a complete basics dvd. You'd have to go to a dojo and put on a kimono and roll. But this book and it's author/instructor Gene Simco does a great job in explaining. People get caught up sometimes in this art and want to do the ""fancy stuff"". If you don't know the basics, you can't really do BJJ effectively. Because in reality, the fancy stuff is the icing...the basics is the cake that holds the icing. Peace and good training to you."
2,Not impressed,"The authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really, really, really want to get a poodle, considering all the work and money they take, than on giving valuable information. Not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog/puppy, and caring for them. It does have chapters on care and grooming, etc, but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle, at least that was the impression I had."
3,Get yourself a lil poodie,"I have owned Labrador Retrievers for years. Due to my marriage, and the loss of my last Lab, I married into a 7.5 lb. poodles life. Is it a dog, really? After all, Poodles have ""hair not fur""...this is the most adorable, intelligent, sensitive lil creature, and I adore her. I take her out into the field with me, so that she can be a real dog, and she is a specimen to behold. Get a poodle. Love it, and nurture it, and it becomes just one of the family...as for the book, just get a poodle, they will teach you...."
4,ok poodle book,a good overall poodle book .i liked the photos but a lot more on personality should have been included
3,I took it off,It was always in the way whenever I wanted to use a ramp or when I was sliding anything out of my bed. When it broke I actually viewed it as a blessing.
4,tailgate step,great nee saver great for getting in or out but wish it could lock in the down position to minimize swing. if your not sure just buy 1 for under 40 its worth it
4,Happy To Find,Although I haven't used these yet...they are exactly what I was looking for. I often make pie crusts and freeze them for me and my husband. Since I don't need a regular size pie for just 2...these are perfect. They arrived quickly and in very good condition. Thank You!
3,color,"I bought 3 plum fiesta bowls ( 6-3/8- Inch small pie plate) and when I received them, 2 were the same color and the 3rd one was a different shade. This is a gift, so I was disappointed."
2,Needs to be better packaged.,"I was disappointed to find that my Fiestaware Sea Mist Pie Baker had arrived in about 1,000 different pieces, because more care hadn't gone into the packaging. Perhaps more padding, or at least the word 'Fragile' stamped on the box may have helped. I ended up having to return it and decided not to order a replacement because I wasn't confident that the second one wouldn't arrive in the same state. Also I had imagined the 'sea mist' to be more of a light mint-y green color (like jadeite), but the green was actually a bit darker and more of a light green than a mint green. I'm usually very satisfied with purchases from Amazon.[com.] It was a surprise that it didn't work out this time around."
5,Wonderful Multi-purpose Dish,"I had looked for individual pie dishes a couple of years ago, but the nice stoneware ones are very hard to find and very expensive. When we purchased Fiestaware dishes recently, I happened to come across this pie plate and I had to order some, especially when I realized Amazon had a special offer of buy 4 for the price of 3! Since I could not find these dishes in the store anywhere, I ordered a set of 4, sight unseen, and was very pleased when they arrived. The quality is wonderful like you would expect from Fiestaware, they were well-packed and arrived in good condition, and they are very attractive. They will make great ice cream bowls or other dessert bowls in addition to being used for individual pot pies. We even used them this morning for scrambled eggs. I think we are going to get a lot of use out of these bowls because of their practical size and their beauty. I love them!"
4,Nice small ceramic pie plates!,"I've just purchased two of these small ceramic pie plates. They're good ceramic, highly glazed, but a little small! They'll hold 1-1/2 cups of filling nicely, but no more than that. That means they're about 1/4 the volume of a conventional 9"" pie plate.I do like the two I purchased. I just wish they'd been a shade larger."
2,Way to small.,"I love Fiesta dishes and have a lot! I ordered 2 of these thinking they would be great for a small pie. Well they are the size of a soup bowl and way to small for a pie. I returned both, if I want to make a pie this size I will use my soup bowl for pot pies. The quality was good it was just the size that did not work for what I wanted."
4,"""Hillary Scares the Bejesus Out Of Me""","In this book, you will find out why? This is easily one of the funniest books that I have read in a long time.Yes, it is very easy to poke fun at our president, no matter who that may be, but President Bush sure makes it simple. In this diary-style book, the president's innermost thoughts are scribbled out in 3rd-grade penmanship.The book is outright hilarious. We get an in-depth look at the president's IRS audit list, his thoughts on making a movie about his ""poppy,"" his feelings about Dick Cheney, and his outright fear of Hillary Clinton. The mental notes are also hilarious, and the added illustrations make for a complete funny experience.This book was a really fast read, and it was extremely humorous. It is definately for anyone with a mere pulse of a sense of humor."
3,Good Latin Twist,"This Spanish version of some of The Cure's best songs is a good latin twist to the echoing sounds of one of the best british bands in a long time. If you are eager to rediscover the awesome sounds of The Cure, I highly recommend this abstract, but fun album."
5,Excelente,"This album is one of the greatest tributes ever done. While many tribrute albums go on to reinvent the song risking fame or one hit wonder, or you're left scratching your head of whether you want to buy the albume simply because it has one or 2 great songs on it, this CD will not leave any doubts. Sung in spanish and modernized it will leave you stunned. 5 stars, get this album because it's been discontinued!!"
4,worthwhile,"Diverse, highly flavored versions of classic songs.Robert Smith's rich, multi-textured music has always lent itself to other interpretations, and this compilation does it justice."
5,An excellent reference for professionnals and students,"Principles Of Financial Engineering came as an excellent surprise to me, it will probably make a lot of people feel more intelligent about themselves as it explains fairly complex technicalities in a comprehensible way. Neftci book is a very good reference for market professionals like myself in need of a rapid answer, or anyone with a desire to understand more about fixed income and derivatives. Graphical illustrations enhance the text and should make it particularly easy for finance students to understand subjects like synthetic alterations using various financial instruments."
3,"A book with many questions, few answers.","Joan Peyser, best-known for her 'juicy' but excellent biography of Leonard Bernstein, wrote this quixotic tome 10 years before. The book is quixotic in that Peyser is attempting to tell the life story and background of one of the most enigmatic and secretive artists of the 20th century. After reading the book, you almost feel as if it's literally impossible to write a biography of Boulez. Page after page we are told of Boulez's refusal to reveal himself, and Peyser leaves it at that. She makes no attempt to dig deeper, but simply assumes that's the way it is. She also engages in some ridiculous pop-psychology in trying to explain some of Boulez's personality traits and career moves. Her Bernstein biography is great, but he's an easy subject. Boulez might as well be wearing a chastity belt, he's so impenetrable."
4,Has anyone played Spawn for Sega Dreamcast ???,I have not played this game. Can someone please write a review an tell if this game for X-box is as good as the turnament battle version of Spawn for Sega Dreamcast.
1,Pathetic,"At first glance, i thought to myself...""Hey, a game with Spawn and lots of action...cool.""After i somehow endured the first hour of this game i neither able to glance at it nor think straight. My mind had been forever scared from this visually shocking (shockingly horrible), painful, pointless, corrupt, lame, unecessarily foul-mouthed, idiotic, disgraceful game (if it could actually be called that.......i could go on and on) THE GAME SUCKS!!!!! Dont even consider buying it.One of the worst parts of the title (not worthy of being called a game) is the soundtrack. The developement crew was hyped up because they were going to record songs by....................Marilyn Manson?! No way, i dont think so. Marilyn Manson doesnt deserve to be alive as it is, but to put his crap in a video game. This game is pathetic."
2,Neat....but lacking,"If you are a fan of spawn comics or if you are into repetitive mindless button mashing, then this could be the game for you. My frustration with this game is how you had to adjust the camera angles during fight sequences. I am not sure if there is a way that this can be better done, but it made me dizzy watching it at times. I liked some of the cynical humor, especially after you beat the ""violator"" and he says ""your my b**ch"". I am also a fan of intermediate saves, which this game does not have. I wish more games would do this. Wouldn't buy, but okay as a rental."
1,Demonic Slashing,"Spawn Armageddon is hack and slash game played in the third person perspective. Similar to ""Devil May Cry"", you use combo moves and slash at demonic creatures with your sword/shield. You can also collect and purchase weapons like guns and magic spells. When you kill demonic creatures you can collect their souls and add to your magic or energy level. The main problem with this game are the bland level designs, repetitious action and bad camera angles.Pros:+good attack combos+lots of abilities+good controlsCons:-boring level design-bad camera angles-cheap graphics-repetative-weak sound fx-junk heavy metal music-game has a generic feelThis game is not worth buying because it just looks and feels so cheap and generic."
2,Soundtrack Fodder,"Very disappointing. And I thought there would be momentum building after the brilliant SoulJacker. There's nothing here to latch onto. Every song seems destined for the Shrek II soundtrack. Also, what's with the beatbox? E should realize by now what a secret weapon he has in drummer, Butch - the man grooves.I just couldn't hook into these songs. They sound like parodies of Eels compositions - like someone distilled all E's pain and suffering and found a way to package and market it. E's always had an ear for a good pop hook, but here we've got nothing but candy and sugar - where's the grit?Okay, E - so you did one for Dreamworks. Now can you do one for us again?"
5,have yourself a shootenanny,"E and Butch have been producing rock of the finest quality for years. While Souljacker was full fledged rock, in Shootenanny E emerges somehow having found how to mix some rockin' folk with the melancholy we loved in Electroshock Blues. All I can do is stand back and say: ""how did this happen? I'm toe-tappin' happy and drip-droppin' wishing life was better."" What?!? you say. Yeah, that's what E does that no one else is on to. You're happy, you're diggin' the folk twang, you want more, and yet you can also sit back and honestly, nostalgically say: these are rock hard times.Now that E has emerged above the clouds of CMJ indie kids and come into a realm where there is no one but E, the kind of unique realms of rock dwelt in by the likes of Beck, guys who are flying solo and continue to amaze, we can say: enough talk, just enjoy Eels."
4,Not quite up to snuff with their others.,"The songs are great, the lyrics are great, the album is great... just not as great as the others. All of their albums so far have received 5 stars by me, until this one. Some of the songs seem out of place. It was refreshing to see some of the songs recapture the sound that was discovered on E's solo albums, but even this can't bump it up to a five."
2,"Seriously mediocre, sadly...","I loved The Eels' Electro-Shocked Blues and Daisies of the Galaxy (I'm not familar with Beautiful Freak or Souljacker). Shootenanny, however, comes as a big disappointment, unfortunately. I have listened to it twice, and far too often, I have the image of a group of teenagers gathered in front of a tv on a Tuesday afternoon...this is the soundtrack to the opening credits of that half-hour rerun...and as for the 4-5 slow tracks, I'm too often reminded of how good, by comparison, Daisies of the Galaxy, is...my advice to E: one day, please move far away from pop...into folk, country, blues...or 'experimental' music...God knows you're a huge talent..."
2,Too Bad,"I actually caught these guys singing live at a small, local bar. Kind of a shame. I mean everything from this album was pretty blah imo. I like Daisies of the Galaxy and Electroshock Blues an awful lot. They played songs from both of these too... and ""improved"" them as well. The pace was sped up, the bass was cranked up, and all the interesting quirks on the CD's were replaced simply by bland, loud guitar work. Awe well, I'll just stick with what i know."
1,Disappointed,I am a big EELS fan and was blown away by Souljacker but was very disappointed with this album. It is just boring and dull. I've listened to it in my car constantly for the past week and can barely remeber 3 or 4 lines from any of the songs. Bummer.
2,Blah,"I love the Eels and just cant get into this one. Verse-chorus-verse-chorus-chorus blah blah. I am not sure what happened here, but after the Souljacker master stroke, either the pressure or the label got in the way."
5,"Ritmo excelente, simple y muy alegre",Tigrillos representan la alegria que solo se encuentra en la musica mexicana. Demuestra que lo simple no es complicado y solo hay que bailar y disfrutar esta vida.
5,Wonderful Relaxation Book,"My girls (ages 3 and 5) love this book. The can pretend to be the boy or the bear, and it helps them relax in a fun way."
3,Just okay,Just okay - my three year old has a very hard time falling asleep - maybe he's too young for this book - while it's a nice idea it doesn't do much to help him sleep - but he likes it.
1,take advantage of parents,"This is the second time I ordered a book to try and help my children with their OCD and have received a paper thin book that was completely over priced. I believe that they are taking advantage of the fact, that as parents, we try to do all we can to fix medical problems that are out of our control. I would go to the ends of the earth if I could help my childrens feel better, but I don't like it when someone takes advantage of the situation. I won't buy a book that I haven't picked up and looked at before hand anymore."
5,doll carriage Pram Stroller,This is a very sturdy four large wheeled stoller or baby carriage for dolls. It is build very well and durable. Good for ages 3 and up and is more like the kind mom's used with children born in the 70' and even used in 40's. My grand-daughter and her mother think this it is great fun and you can tell it is not one of the cheap ones. As far as educational because all parts are movable and so real life like it can be used as a eye to hand cordination tool. It is very safe. LOVE IT!
3,Disappointing,"This stroller had good reviews so we bought it for our granddaughter, even though it was fairly expensive. The first one came with wheels which had to be pushed into metal axels. The plastic connectors were so fragile that they broke with a simple touch. I contacted the seller who immediately arranged for a replacement stroller. The replacement arrived but had the same problem. I asked the seller to send me two replacement wheels, which they did, quickly and graciously. We have seen the same problem with all the wheels, so finally just duct taped the wheels in place. Our granddaughter and her friends are delighted with the stroller and use it often and gently. I'm sure the wheels will be fine, especially since we have the replacements and lots of duct tape, but I am sorry that the plastic components are so shabby for the price of the stroller. I do commend the seller for being so responsive and other parts of the stroller seem to be sturdy."
1,Sisters book of love,A must book for all of our best women friends and sisters - a tender and loving book about life for all women. Total beautiful. I wish there were more available. I have bougth many for gifts and will buy more when the book is available.
5,An excellent classic toy!,"There is a good reason why this toy is still popular more than 50 years later. It requires a variety of skills to make it work -- creativity, hand-eye coordination, technical understanding, and patience. And yet, somebody lacking any or all of those skills can still play with it. Anybody can doodle aimlessly on an etch a sketch, but with practice you can make something really special. And then, with just a shake, it disappears forever, as if it never was! There is something mysterious and magic about that whole concept, which is part of the fun. This is a toy, it is a skill development tool, and it is an artistic canvas. There is nothing else quite like it. It reminds you that art, like life, is fleeting, and if you can't find a philosophical meaning in the whole thing, then you might as well just shake it up and have fun with it. Gotta love the Etch a Sketch."
1,Etch Sketch Magic Screen Review,This is not for anyone who is not serious about spending hundreds of hours to develop the skill of drawing on this instrument...I was disappointed in how it operates and do not recommend it to anyone who does not plan on hours and hours of practice to develop drawing skills with the limited movements of the toy.
4,A classic,Our boy doesn't have the patience to use it for a sustained amount of time. Never the less it still teaches hand and eye coordination.
1,Don't bother,This product came already used & would not erase. I don't know why they keep selling these. You can draw but it won't erase!
3,Classic,Bought these for my daughters to show them some old school fun. well the old school fun lasted about 20 minutes before they were in the toy box for good.
1,Not How I Remembered,"Don't get me wrong, Etch A Sketch is an awesome toy. As long as the buyer receives a product that works properly. I'm not sure if the quality of the product (we received) has changed since I was a kid (the answer - probably yes), but immediately after opening the toy for my 5 year old (he was celebrating his bday), the thing just didn't perform well. We soon realized that the lines didn't erase from the screen. After shaking the toy like madpeople, we just couldn't get the images to really disappear. Now, with my toy in the 80s, the images could be easily erased with minor, controlled shaking.Which is a shame, since both my kids were looking forward to a really cool toy. A toy that I talked and hyped up quite a bit, reflecting on my own youth where I'd spend hours creating cool images and designs on my Etch A Sketch. I don't think we've quite given up on this toy - we may look for another vendor or store to purchase from in the future."
1,Doesn't Work :(,I had the same problem with this toy as most others. The lines dont's really erase. I also found the lines to be too thin and faint for a 4 - 6 yr old. I'll be giving mine away and looking for another make for the same toy.
2,Cheaply made,"Got this for my son. He loves it (of course)but not very durable. Less than a month and the vertical line is not dark anymore. The pad barely erases the previous lines. Maybe they have always been this way, but I don't remember that from when I was a kid. Definitely feels cheap. The price was good, but I would pay a few dollars more for better quality."
1,Lines burn into screen--very frustrating for little ones.,"After the initial nostalgia wears off, the frustration mounts as the lines refuse to remove themselves from the screen. Not at all like I remember mine as a child and both the young children who got these gave up on it after a very short while. Finally just threw them out. Guess the saying is true, they don't make them like they used to."
4,a classic toys; lots of fun for bored kids,This is a classic toy; has been enjoyed by bored kids for at least 3 decades. Light and durable - good to bring with you to a cafe to keep kids occupied
3,gift,I bought this as a gift. It seemed smaller than I remember. Arrived on time. I hope my daughter likes it!
3,As close to the 'old' classic as there is but not exact.,"I got this for my son, who is very creative. I also have my original Etch A Sketch from when I was a kid. I can definitely tell a quality difference in the materials. Of course, most things made now are made cheaper.He loves it, but I have to agree with the other reviews that it does not erase the lines completely and it takes quite a bit of effort and shaking to get it blank again. Overall, it's okay, but I'll stick with my 'original' original Etch A Sketch! :o)"
5,back to the 80s,"Well, it's great having this thing back after 25 years, used to play with this for hours, so great present for little kids and adults. Great to be back to the basics. Now I'm a graphic designer so you can tell how much the board touched me."
2,Just not the same,"It looks very similar to the Etch-A-Sketch of days past... but this ""classic"" model doesnt draw the same at all. The etching lines are VERY thin, and more disappointingly, the screen does not erase well at all. You shake and shake and shake, but the markings on the screen never erase completely. Bummer!"
2,Disappointment,"Not the Classic in size or quality. Smaller than original, does not erase thoroughly, and the contrast, while using, is not as strong as the true Classic. I read the reviews before purchasing but my grandson really wanted the Classic Etch A Sketch for his birthday. It's not like the original Classic Etch A Sketch. Very disappointed."
3,Not as good as it used to be,"This Etch a Sketch was, unfortunately, a bit of a disappointment. Out of all the Etch a Sketches featured on Amazon, many don't state sizes or list the size as having a 7.5"" diagonal screen. This one explicitly states it has a 9.5 inch (diagonal) screen and the only other one with a 9.5"" inch is the 100th Anniversary Tin Etch a Sketch. So, I opted for this one.Unfortunately, it's a 7.5"" screen.I don't know what's happened to Etch A Sketch, but you can barely see the lines anymore. The sketched lines are a medium dark gray on a medium light gray. I remember my childhood etch a sketches as having more contrast and, when we are out shopping, it seems the travel etch a sketches sold at the checkout lines of local stores do draw with more contrast.I thought we'd all pick this up and fool around with it a bit but, after all of us tried it out, it's been sitting on the counter unused and I doubt that will change."
1,"Made in China, not Ohio","This is a classic toy, however since it is made in China and no longer Ohio (hence Ohio Art), the quality went down the tubes. I had an original one years ago, and although the white knob broke off after many years of play the steel axle still allowed it to be workable. But this version has some cheap aluminum axle, which bent and completely broke off after about 3 weeks. So now all we can do is draw a vertical line."
1,never again,"What A f---ing rip off, I can't believe Amazon has this rip off company on their site. It is totally misleading as far as how many caps you get and to sell A 10 cent item for 3.99, NEVER AGAIN."
1,Total Rip-off,Bike shops will either give you tips or charge $.20 or less. Charging $2 for one tip is just ridiculous.
1,what a rip off,go to your local bike shop and if you ask nicely they might even give u couple of them for free .
5,Cable Tip,"This is a great product that keeps your bicycle control cables from fraying at the ends. Just slip over the end of cable and crimp with needle nose pliers. Worth the trouble of doing, makes overall appearance of bicycle more appealing."
3,More about Yoga,"the details about Mahasaya are interesting, especially his instruction to his devotees not to form organaizations. This was because Babaji's plan was for PARAMAHANSA YOGANANADA to do this on a global scale.Read more about all these matters in AUTBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI from Self-Realization Publishers (Orange cover) available via Amazon.comalso recommended: Journey to Self-Realization.....Man's Eternal Quest.......the Divine Romance...All by Paramahansa Yogananda."
3,By-the-numbers second season episode...,"This episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" stands as the perfect example why second season just wasn't all that good. It's does everything it can to be the best episode it can possibly be, but in the end serves as a forgettable episode with a predictable story and not much in the way of action or suspense. Bill Campbell is great as Captain Okona, but is given too little screen time for him to develop his character. Too much screen time is given to Brent Spiner as Data, who is working with a holographic image of Joe Piscopo to learn how to be funny. There is a great scene with Guinan, but one gets the feeling the writers didn't have enough interesting things to do with the Okona plot that they spent half the episode with Data. Overall, it's not a particularly bad episode. It's actually pretty good. The problem lies in the lack of plot development."
1,A dangerous approach,"Dr Haykal has a dangerous approach towards our prophet's life..He claims that the Quran is his only miracle.I don't agree with this view since we cannot ignore so many traditions ( hadith) regarding the other miracles like the splitting of the moon,and his companions' drinking water from his fingers.The scientific method should not mean to accept only things that we can support with our reason. It is also scientific to consider the confirmed traditions.It is just reasonable for our prophet (saw) to have miracles like the previous prohets in the sense that he is the seal of the prophethood .His being the seal of it requires to seal the miracles by having comprehensive miracles. As a result, besides being a comrehensive and easy-to-read book, the view he hold for our prophet's miracles is incorrect."
1,worthless battery,"Battery came in new OEM packaging, but that was the only good thing. Put in the phone and charged once, then once we'd used it for a couple of days and tried to re-charge - nothing. Basically the battery is now dead and we got less than 3 days of use - might as well have been disposable. Don't buy these cheap batteries unless you plan to buy in bulk and throw them away after 1 charge!"
1,Did not work,This was a waste of money for me. The battery did not work... paid way too much ($5 plus s&h) to end up putting it in the trash can! Thanks
5,Great Replacement Battery!,I bought this to replace the exact model battery that died in my cell phone. It works great!
2,no low battery warning,The battery life is acceptable but there is no audio beep or visual low battery indication sent to phone. The phone just dies when the indicator shows more battery life. I would not recommend this product.
1,Must be an OLD battery,"This was a bad experience from the get-go! Ordered a battery December 13, 2010. It was back-ordered until mid-January. When we finally received it, the battery would not hold a charge. It was worse than the 4-year old battery we had. I seriously doubt it was a new battery. Sent request for RMA within 30 days. NO ANSWER! Have contacted BlueMall twice and no reply. DO NOT BUY from BLUEMALL or BargainCell."
1,"The seller sent a dead battery, and called his voicemail, but it was full, seller name is ""VIBE CELLULAR""","The seller sent a dead battery, and called his voicemail, but it was full, seller name is ""VIBE CELLULAR"""
1,the worst battery I've have,"I have ordered twice for the same battery from the same company in July, 2009,After I got the first order, I charged it and put to my cell phone, but the battery can only last 3 hours. I thought maybe the one I got was not good, then I ordered the second one since I saw the customer review was 5 star. After I got the second one, it was the same bad as the first one. The power only last 3 or 4 hours, then I should recharge again. I called the company several times, there were always nobody answered the phone. I lest message for them. I didn't get call back so far. The battery is the worst one I've had and you have no way to reach the customer service."
4,Sony A_100 DSLR,"I'm pleased with the new camera and am having fun learning its features. The camera bag strap broke the first time I used it, but I think it was pretty much a throw-in item anyway. I'm just lucky it wasn't very high off the ground when it broke! It's a big step up from my Panasonic Lumix FZ20 to an SLR. I've had to get used to changing lenses again. The Lumix had a great macro capability, and I have to buy a bunch of new stuff for the new camera in the way of lenses and filters, but it's exponentially better quality."
2,Arab Gulf States-used travel guide,"I think it's madness to pay full price for a new travel guide, but the used ones don't specify publication date. This one was published in 1996 and so, much of the information is useless.Also, in true Lonely Planet style, the typeface is so tiny, it requires a magnifying glass to see.Generally, the book was very dry and humorless and not very interesting or helpful. A lot of this might come from the fact that many of the Gulf States really are NOT tourist material, but unless you actually see a new book (in a real bookstore) first, I wouldn't order a used guide again, unless you can ascertain the publication date."
1,Garbage Book,"First of all this Iranian guy is correct. The official name of this body of water is PERSIAN Gulf. The term Arabian Gulf was invented in 1970s by some Pan Arabists who failed to show up at their geography classes. The author's use of this term shows simply his arrogance and fact that he does not know the region nor its people. By using ""Arabian Gulf"" he simply wants to impress ignorant Arabs into buying his book.Other than that his book is useless as it does not touch on the cultural aspects on the region."
2,Read the fine print,"This is a super cute toy but I am not happy about it being made in China. I believe that Amazon should start listing the country of origin for products on the information screen. It would be very helpful to buyers that this matters to who can not read the packaging when making an online purchase. If you are OK with your baby putting this in its mouth, then go ahead and buy it, otherwise you might want to go somewhere where you can find out where your baby products are made."
1,not as fun as it looks,This rattle is a little awkward to hold and is too big and hard for younger babies. It also takes on quite a bit of water when washed. The nose does not beep easily and my infant gives it up rather quickly. She does however enjoy chewing on it.
3,Disappointing,"I've come to expect so much from Gabaldon. She is such a gifted, smart, witty writer. This book was such a letdown to me. Had I not been emotionally invested in the characters prior to reading it, I imagine I would have thought the book was a complete snooze. As it was it was only half a snooze. :)I do hope that Gabaldon doesn't let her editors or fans pressure her to complete the next book before its time. I'd much rather let her take her time to craft a great story than release a book that doesn't advance the story any simply because her editors, or fans, think it's time."
2,A Disappointment!,"Galbadon's latest book is not as engaging as her previous four, which I thought were five-star books. AFiery Cross is a very big disappointment! It goes on and on with no real action or building of tension. So dull, I can't finish it. Has Ms. Galbadon run out of ideas? Too much biology in this book, too. She certainly has done her research, however."
3,Drudging Along!,"This was by far the hardest book in the series to read. I just couldn't stand reading any more about gardening, farm life, ect. I wanted action! But of course I had to read The Fiery Cross in order to get to the next one in the series. I felt like Galbadon tried to hard to make the book her expected length when she could have summed it up in far fewer pages."
3,"Not as good as 1-3, but better than 4","The fifth book in the Outlander series. Not as good as books 1-3, but way better than 4. Claire and Jamie have settled in the ""backcountry"" in the Colonies. Now, they're preparing, as best they can, for the Revolutionary War, which Claire knows is coming in a few short years. This book also contains a fair bit about Jamie & Claire's daughter Brianna, and her husband Roger, both from the 20th century, too. The best thing about this author is how real Jamie and Claire seem."
2,Long-awaited Sequel Not Worth Waiting For,"I've read all of Galbaldon's books. Like many I was captivated by the first and second book and I eagerly awaited each subsequent edition. In her sequels Galbaldon never quite captures the magic of the original story. With each book, I've been increasingly disappointed. I had hoped that, after waiting so long for The Fiery Cross to be finished, it would recapture the essence of the first book. Sadly, it doesn't.This book is written as if everything was an afterthought-- ""oh, yeah, I almost forgot to include something about ____"" -- rather than a well-crafted plot. As a result, it is a rambling story of too many people of too little consequence held together with bits on herbal remedies, biology lessons, and celtic phrases.I wish she had stopped with the first three books."
5,Fantastic as always,I found these books started to slow down after the first three... But still fantastic! This is my 2nd time reading the series; anxiously awaiting the 8th installment!
3,Okay maybe 2 1/2 stars,"I was disapointed in this book. I wanted to love it, I waited so long for it, that it didn't have to do too much to please. I bought it the first day it hit the shelves and it was also given to me as a christmas present that year.I found it boring and a little tedious in places. I didn't get a lot of what was happening. Maybe I got it but it was so dragged out that i really didn't care.I was bored by a great number of things in this book that I just wanted to put it down and not read anymore of it.I have been a fan for years and will read the new book, but I am hoping for better next time around."
1,wait for the paperback if you must,"I was very disapointed in this book. I loved the first four - could not put them down. However, I had no trouble putting this one down for weeks at a time. I finally finished it hoping that it would get better - it did not. It felt like it was written as an after thought just to fulfill a contract obligation - or to make fans stop clammering for any more books in this series."
3,"Not exciting, but still good","I preordered this book through Amazon, so I had mine delivered to my house the very day it was released... I couldn't get into it at all. Six months later, I finally picked it up again, and it took me about 2 weeks to read it. I haave read all of DG's other books in one or two days, so this was definitely NOT a page turner. There were a few exciting segments in the book, but they were few and far between. The entire book seems to just be setting the stage for the her next (and final?) book in this series. DG still spins a good tale, but as I was reading this I kept thinking, ""Where is this going??"" Ultimately it went nowhere, and took it's time getting there, but it was a pleasant trip anyway. I recommend this book if you are a fan of DG, and I have high hopes for the next book! She has really set up a lot of interesting possibilities."
1,Review? Opinions.,"I found the book disappointing and could quote many other reivews by readers who were right on the mark as to why this book fell short of it's expectations. I think the point has been made about.. ..the changes in the characters and the juvenile scenes that go hand in hand with a lack of plot, but what bothers me more is the way this ""review process"" is handled. I know a few who wrote and their reviews have not shown up, so why bother? I guess only avid, or should I say ""rabid"" supporters of Diana Gabaldon are being posted. When an author falls short of her potential, I think it's only kind to let them know. I hope the next book is better."
1,"skim, skim, skim","Based on the previous books in the Outlander series, I couldn't wait to get this one.... And then once I got it I couldn't wait for it to be over! So boring, so tedious... I swear Claire spent 100 pages just trying to get some coffee made. I've heard the next one is better, but I'm not sure I can start it based on my Fiery Cross experience."
5,'Till death,"(english is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes)I hesitated a lot when I was about to buy this book. Although I own the previous Outlander books, some of the reviews were really hard on this book. Some people said was that it is boring. It is not!! Sure it's not so fast paced as the previous books, but this is just the ""peace before the storm"". You can see conflict in the horizon, and at the same time, the characters are trying to build a life together.Other reviews said that this book had too many historical details about daily life. And let me tell you, even if it is true, it is also true that this is the first book I've read where those details are INTERESTING!What I loved about the book is the way it tells the story of love and marriage. Jamie and Claire, middle age, more mature, but still passionate, and so happy to be with each other. And also Brianna and Roger, young, inexperienced, but learning as they go.If you believe in love for a lifetime, this is a book for you!"
2,The Fiery Cross - Long Winded,"Having high expectations of this book after REALLY enjoying the last 4 (even though I am no fan of first person), I have been really disappointed. I have found 'The Fiery Cross' long winded, full of excessive unneccessary detail and quite frankly boring. It is a hard book to stay interested in and basically nothing happens until 2/3rds the way through. Huge detail is put into how people stand/speak, the baby drooling, the baby moving, gazing at the scenery, gazing at Jamie, etc.. very tedious. The characters seem to have lost all depth and come across quite shallow and at times silly. Im not sure if this book is supposed to be more humourous but if it has it has failed dismally.Sorry Diana, this is a real bummer!! Lets just say, I will be very tentative about buying Book 6."
2,not so good,"by far her worst book: no real plot, Jamie and Claire worn completely dry, not much John Grey, vurtualy no Ian and when there is its disapointingly predictable; it goes right from the point were he left to the present and nothing happens, all his past actions turn into one big detour. Most scenes, if once good, drag on for way to long and even the scenes between Bree and Roger get really old. the one thing i did enjoy was all of the writing about the babies, which surprised me. I didnt read the last 100 pages, i got bored."
2,So?,"Well, this is definitely good storytelling, but why isn't anything happening? I've just finished the book, and I feel rather cheated. This is filler material - here's how life is in the Colonial America, down to the most excruciating detail. I guess I could have read farmer's almanac if I really wanted to know. But 400 pages devoted to one day? Marcel Proust did it, and IMHO, D. Gabaldon is not Proust. Read it if you're a hard core fan, but wait for the final book if you value your time."
5,Wonderful transaction.,"Great book at a very good price, You can't beat a penny, now, can you? Shipping was quick, and item was in excellent condition. Thanks!"
5,fiery cross,Diana did it again! must read all her books she is the best at details. feels like you in the book
3,DINNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,"Sorely disappointed. Wanted to be transported to the magic, and instead got lost in too much text...not enough emotional imagery. Perhaps next time??"
3,It's Okay.,"This book is the 5th in a series of Diana Gabaldons Outlander series. Although it was fun to catch up with the characters Claire and Jamie and get to know the other characters as well, it lost some of the quality the other 4 had. I buzzed through the other 4 but this one took me over a year to read. I continually found myself putting it down to read other books, it didn't help that I got hooked on Jean Aules Earth children's series. It has the Diana Gabaldons quantity without the pizzazz of a story that keeps you up night after exhausted night just to find out what happens next. Despite it all I felt compelled to finish because the characters are extremly addictive. I am still going to read the 6th too."
3,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....,"What happened? I am trying my best to come up with some positives for this long, uninteresting, trivial book. I fell in love with Jamie and Claire in Outlander and am glad they're still a happy, healthy couple. But each book has become more and more plodding. Has ""middle age"" made Jamie boring too? I don't think so... yet why is the wedding day taking 7 million pages? I think the war itself seemed shorter than this read. Diana, please, give us back some magic and excitement!"
2,Sorely disappointed,"Frankly, I thought the first 2 chapters could've been left out completely....or the first 200 pages really. I was more pleased w/ the excerpt from the ""Companion"" than was I was w/ the book. It was like Diana forgot where she left off. I felt the last 3 chapters of the book seemed to finally hold my interest, instead of droning on & on about a dysfunctional family that really didn't need to be introduced in such great depth to provide adequate info for later on in the story. Very poor editing as far as I'm concerned. I'm hoping the next book will be edited better (and won't take an extra year from the orginally scheduled release date) before hitting the stores. Oh yes. Please, give Roger a break; the poor guy has suffered enough."
2,A colossal disappointment,"I'm sad to say I believe Miss Gabaldon has fallen prey to her own success. ... I don't know if this is arrogance and complacency on Miss G.'s part, or genuine lack of enthusiasm and direction. I admit I finally gave up on THE FIERY CROSS after 435 pages, when it became apparent that every ""lead"" was destined to conclude in a dead end. (All those cuddly babies, kittens, and goats [!] finally did me in.) Ms. G. needs to think hard about whether or not she really has anything more to say about these characters and, if not, let them (and her readers) off the hook and move on to something else. She's too talented to bore us all to death."
1,Where's the Plot?,"I was so looking forward to this book, but it is hopelessly boring. Endless descriptions of chores and smelly, dirty diapers. I reached the end of the book and realized that nothing had happened. No new characters, Brianna is annoying, something too awful to be forgiven is done to Roger to liven up the non-existent plot, even Jamie was annoying! But, most annoying of all was too-perfect Claire, who has turned into such a Mary Sue. Don't judge this series on this book! The first four are wonderful, addictive novels. What happened Diana Gabaldon?"
4,Well..I didn't like the way Jamie met Brianna,"I greatly anticipated the moment when Jamie would meet his daughter because Ms Gabaldon created nothing less than a perfect man in Jamie Fraser - his dialogue and actions being the proof - but I admit it was a big let down when Brianna found Jamie. I just didn't like what Jamie thought she was there for, and I couldn't buy for a moment that he wouldn't have recognized her, if not instantly, at least within a few minutes, as we're told often how much they look alike, and Jamie HAD seen pictures of her. It's trivial, I know, and the only flaw in this perfect series."
2,This book bites!,"I'm not a fan of romance-type books, but the 1st book in this series was so good, I kept coming back for more. Unfortunately, I read The Fiery Cross, or, as I would rename it, A Year in the Life of the American Pioneer. I can't even tell you what this book is about. It has no plot. It is set in the time leading up to the Revolutionary War, but nothing much happens. Although the author's writing style is very good (and the only reason this book did not get 1 star), and the characters are likeable and familiar, the book is BORING!!! NOTHING HAPPENS!! I mean, NOTHING! It almost comes across as a book written to explain the interim between the previous book and the next book. If this book had a plot, I could not find it. Hopefully the next one will be better, if I can bring myself to read it."
1,waited 3 years to be bored?,"this is so boring i could not stick with it. i read hoping to find the good parts. outlander has some pages that could turn quickly into pleasure and suprise.not to be found in this one. it should not have been released.i LOVE all the others but this time out , jamie and claire were not the couple of old. this book reminded me of the rewriting of gone with the wind.i will know more about the next one out before i buy."
3,rooting for roger,"More than anything, DG's characters just draw me in; they very nearly breathe. It's the characters that I'm most interested in and frankly, I don't much like Brianna. But I love Roger. So I found myself getting impatient and angry with the way he was portrayed in this novel. Roger wasn't overpowered by Brianna in the last book. But in the Fiery Cross he sort of shrivels up. Brianna bulldozes right over him. Jamie treats him poorly (and nearly kills him, too). I kept waiting (and hoping) for Roger to be the hero. Instead, the poor guy is made to suffer through one disaster after another. He can't do anything right. And then, the guy gets hanged and can't sing anymore. Singing was the only thing he was any good at! He finally saves Jamie's life. But not with swords or in a cool, dramatic way --- instead, he ends up sucking snake venom out of Jamie's leg. Ick. Generally, I liked the book, but I hope in future volumes Roger will get the respect he deserves."
5,GREAT STORY,Great story along with the other books in the series.Make sure you get both parts 1 & 2 on this one.
5,Love Outlander!,Just finished this and I enjoyed the story. Nothing to dramatic but kept me interested. These books are so large that for me I will wait for Fall to snuggle in and read the next in the series. Love to read a 1000 page book on KindLe and I thank the author for making this entire series available on Kindle. I have bought them all and look forward to each and every new one. These are books that I will read again as there is so much information.
3,Why?,"I am such a Gabaldon fan. And, oh, Jamie....{{{sigh}}}. Are there any other romantic heroes besides him? I remember reading ""Outlander"" and telling all my friends it was the best book I had ever read. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this latest installment. I've had it since day one and I have not read past page 21. It's too tedious and I feel like Jamie and Claire have lost their passion. As far as Brianna and Roger - well I think they are boring and I think they've only been introduced as young lovers because Jamie and Claire are gettin' old. I'm still giving 3 stars in hopes of convincing myself it's worth reading and maybe I'll at least get my money's worth."
4,"A long, detailed book, but I liked it!","Yes, the book is long. There are many detailed descriptions of daily life during pre-Colonial times. But that is what I liked about the book. I felt like I was actually reading ""information"" and not just fluff and sex and such. Also, I enjoyed reading about Brianna and some of the other characters."
4,More Exciting Highlander Adventure!,"Fast paced, exciting adventure with the Frazers! Roger and Brianna joined at last, while Stephen Bonnet remains at large in person and imagaination. Rumblings of war and traitors hanging in the glen. Find out what happened to Ian, Fergus and Marsali and a host of new interesting characters. Always suspense that makes you anxious to turn the page and find out what happens next! Lots of twists and turns and some surprises. As always, a great read and never long enough!!"
5,The Fiery Cross,"I believe that Diana did an excellent job!!! I have read some of the previous reviews and it seems like some readers were disappointed that it wasn't a true romance. The Fiery Cross is a book of ""Life"", with everyday situations involved for this time frame. I really loved this book and didn't want it to end! I recommend this book for anyone!! Thank you so much for making my life more enjoyable with your writing."
3,something missing,"Outlander fans will read this and like it, but I have to agree it is missing the magic of the other books. The plot is slow and mundane. The breastfeeding goes on and on - for heaven's sake, give us a break! Every other page is about milk squirting or hurting Brianna's breasts or messing up her dress. Claire and Jamie are reduced to sex-crazed wooden characters who constantly do it on stairs, benches, standing up, in the barn...come on now. Brianna's annoying baby Jemmy is constantly screaming, sweating, or spitting up all over the place. The weaving together of the plot just isn't there this time...but you'll be glad to be back with your favorite characters anyway."
4,Fan of the Outlander Series,Another good read by the author. Enjoy the plots and her writing structure of not repeating the entire series with each book. If you have not read from the beginning you will get lost (and that is the way it should be). Can't wait for more on this series.
3,The Fiery Cross (Outlander),"Having devoured the previous books in this series I started reading this one with great anticipation, but was soon disappointed. I skipped over large sections of boring detail, pressing on in hope of finding a story line in keeping with the flavour of the author's previous books. Finding none, I looked at reviews of the next book in the series, but learned it is even more difficult to wade through. Pity.The Fiery Cross (Outlander)"
1,The Fiery Cross,"Simply put...whenever the story gets interesting, the author cuts off the plot.The description on the dust jacket makes the book appear to be very different than it actually is. If you are looking for a time traveler story line, do not read this book. Very little is about time travel."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,"Wow, I don't know what to say, but that I am relieved that I am not the only one who felt this way with this book. I'm also encouraged that the next book got better reviews! I'm reading it now. I almost decided not to, this book was so bad. But I loved the ones prior, so I fought my way through...it only took me two or three months! What a chore. Fortunately, the sixth book is already proving to be more interesting."
2,Misses the Mark,"Please don't get me wrong; I LOVED the first and second books in the Outlander series, but I think they have gotten progressively worse and The Fiery Cross is not a good book. It is agonizingly detailed without any purpose. I really don't need 4 1/2 pages on a stinky diaper.Countless new characters are introduced without any direction or reason. None of them enhance the story or advance the plot....is there a plot? I felt like this was 1,000 pages of set up for the final book. Jamie does still have his adorable moments that remind us why we love him so much. But I would think Claire would have outgrown her tantrums and moments of ridiculous naivety. Roger and Brianna continue to be bland and boring. In fact, that is how I would sum up the entire book, boring. All fans will read it anyway, but don't expect too much."
1,Disappointing and ridiculous,"I was very tempted to take a red pen to the pages and send the book back with a note requesting a refund, but lucky me, I borrowed it. I enjoyed the four other books and after plodding through this tome found that nothing had really happened of any merit. Diana Gabaldon has played on her past successes to produce this disjointed, uninspired piece of ""work"". I will say the book was entertaining, just not in the manner I think it was intended. I wadded through breast feeding, dirty diapers and pustulent wounds to see what the characters might be doing and it seems all they were interested in was rutting like animals in heat. I think the word I'm looking for here is...plot. By the time I had finished reading this ""piece of work"", I didn't like the characters and really didn't care what they were doing. I was sorry I had wasted my time and angry at myself for not having seen it coming. .... I think it's time to put this story to rest and move on."
1,This one was a disappointment,"What a disappointment this lastest Jaime/Clair saga has been. I generally can finish a book this size in a couple of days, but I can't seem to get through more than few pages of this really boring, trivial material at a time. Do I really care what is in a baby's diapers? Do I really care how messy breast milk can be?What happened to the historical excitement of the previous books that I would spend hours reading? It's gone. This latest book is a ponderous struggle and will be one book I will try to re-sell. Don't waste your money. If you want more of Clair and Jaimie, just re-read the first ones."
3,You will be dissappointed!,If you are hoping to find the romance and adventure that the first four books contain then you will not like this book.I eagerly anticipated this book even reading excerpts on the web site.The finished product makes me wonder what the wait was for exactly.Instead of adding more characters and extending the series it would have been more satisfying to get to know exsisting characters better and have all of those pesky unanswered questions solved.Overall this book is BORING !!! Very unlike Diana !
1,a nightmare to read,I am reading it in French and it is a nightmare to read. I'm around 500 pages now and I do not know if I will finish reading it.... I cannot believe we have waited so long for a boring book like that. I could not believe it when the first day (in the book) was over and I was at page 300 and nothing happened.... This book doesn't add anything to the story... deceiving.... Sorry Diana
2,Diana&#65533;s Disgusting Book of Bodily Fluids,"A revolting chaos of a manuscript - could the author be thoroughly sick of these books and seek to totally alienate the reader? From Outlander to Outlandish - this 1000 page tome (lots of book for the buck - with very small margins and fonts), the focus is not so much on history, or romance, but bodily secretions. ... nothing is so disgusting that it is overlooked - perhaps it should be renamed The Complete Book of Bodily Fluids? In addition to the penicillin experiments, gangrene, and an unorthodox autopsy, this tale certainly qualifies as an amazingly sick effort. No, I'm not kidding. Tedious to the nth degree I set it aside three different times. I read every blasted page of this revolting book, wanting to unearth some of the magic, mysticism and creativity of the earlier time travel books. I never found it."
2,Please Diana - No More Lactating Women!,"The fact that I was disappointed in this book is not going to keep me from reading the next two. However, I definitely won't be re-reading it when I hear the next one is coming out!And please, Diana, enough of full chests (...) And poopy diapers. Every time I thought you were going to give it a rest, there Briana or the baby goes again!"
1,A Big Nothing,"I read the previous novels and thoroughly enjoyed them. Sorry to say, I gave up on this one after 120 pages or so.............nothing was happening! Very disappointed with Gabaldon's effort. She has extended a good thing too far."
2,Just Not Catching My Interest,"Let's just say I loved! Outlander. I am not so impressed with book 5. First off, the child of Brianna's is so obnoxious and unnecessary, and I am tired about what appears in his diaper, and all that crying for MAMA - eeugh, enough already! -- I don't need that description, over and over again. Also, so they all lust after their spouses, let's have a little plot movement here! I am almost halfway through the book and at best, it is a murder mystery. I am waiting for it to get good, but it just doesn't match up to the previous books, and after such a long wait, I am more than a little disappointed. The other reviews seem to be split 50/50, so I am not encouraged. I hope for the best, considering how wonderful her other books have been, but I just don't race home to read this like her other books... Well, there's still 400 pages so there's hope."
5,Jamie & Claire better than ever!,"I have waited such a long time for the fifth book in this series to be released! It was hard to put it down, but at the same time I didn't want to rush.... because then it would be another long wait to hear Jamie & Claire's voices.I love the way the story is woven around historical fact, with a dash of philosophy thrown in for good measure. I have always been fascinated with history, and how life was lived down to the most mundane of domestic duties.Diana has again showed her unique sense of humour and her extraordinary hold on matters of the heart. I enjoyed reading about Brianna and Roger and how their lives entwined in Jamie & Claire's, yet managed to build their own style of relationship and marriage.I can't wait for the next one."
3,A feel for the time,"Wow, while I didn't think this was the best book of the series, I wasn't as disappointed as so many reviewers. I thought this book did something better than all the others - which was to give a feel for just how hard life was then. The dirt, the chores, the hard scrabble just to keep going each day. This book painted that picture much better than all the others."
1,Save your money,"Books 1-4 were great and I read them in miracle time. However, the fifth one, I can not make myself finish it. It took a week to read each of the other books and it has been 3 months on this last one, I have no interest in the characters boring lives anymore. No action at all or romance."
